00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.950
With the final Season 7 of Game of Thrones
soon upon us let’s take a quick look back

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:07.600
and recap the incredible journey that some
of our most beloved characters have been on

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.930
since the first season when it aired in 2011!

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:13.230
My God they were so young!

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.810
Just in case you’ve been living under a
rock somewhere, Game of Thrones is a HBO TV

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:20.800
series based off the A Song of Ice and Fire
books written by George RR Martin.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.909
In a nutshell it’s a medieval style fantasy
drama with lots of boobs and murder (probably

00:00:24.909 --> 00:00:28.349
gonna have to skip the boobs though to make
it Youtube safe) where different families

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.050
vie for power over the kingdom of Westeros.

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.789
Also there used to be all sorts of magic and
dragons about 300 years ago but things have

00:00:34.789 --> 00:00:38.100
been pretty standard traditional since then.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.180
Lets Go!

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.750
In the far far north where its real cold,
soldiers of the Night’s Watch, come across

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.949
a gruesome scene of murder and encounter the
living dead along with supernatural creature

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:53.100
called a White Walker – Regarded as Little
more than legend and tales to frighten children

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.780
this is pretty bad news, so this guy deserts
and heads South of the wall.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.690
…Where he’s immediately captured by the
men of Winterfell (also still in the North)

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.070
and beheaded as a deserter from the Night’s
Watch.

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.511
The warden of the North and the guy in charge
round here is Ned Stark, he’s basically

00:01:06.511 --> 00:01:10.750
a real solid guy who follows the rules and
takes responsibility but is oblivious to this

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.870
incredible threat from beyond the wall because
he’s too busy dealing with his family.

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:19.180
Him and his wife Catelyn have 5 kids, Robb
the eldest and Heir to Winterfell, Sansa who

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.430
likes cakes and sewing, Bran who loves to
climb stuff, Arya who’s the Tomby and Rickon

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.799
who’s not really important.

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:29.210
Oddly despite being such an upstanding bloke
Ned also has a bastard son called Jon Snow

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.880
who Catelyn hates even though he’s a good
kid.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.080
Also Ned’s in charge of looking after another
lad called Theon Greyjoy.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.380
He’s a real prick.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.409
Now don’t worry if they all look the same
and you can’t tell them apart it’s not

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:40.880
that important just yet.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.890
Out and about they find the corpse of a Stagg
and a Direwolf with a litter of 6 living pups

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.840
that are adopted by each child, with Jon getting
the albino quiet one.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.579
Meanwhile down in Kings landing the hand of
the king, i.e. the guy that does the actual

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:57.179
work has died, and so King Robert Baratheon
travels up to Winterfell to offer the position

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:58.990
to his old brother in arms Ned.

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.189
He brings his Queen and her family along who
are all a bunch of Lannisters.

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.180
The Queen’s twin brother Ser Jaime, her
other brother Lord Tyrion, Her Kids Prince

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.310
Joffrey and young Myrcella and Tommen, some
a more complex but for now you can just assume

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.320
they’re all a bunch of assholes except Tyrion.

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.010
To make things worse Catelyn’s sister Lysa
was married to the former hand of the king,

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.590
and she receives a letter basically saying
he was poisoned by the Lannisters.

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.840
But no proof for now so with a few snide remarks
everyone plays nice over dinner and most of

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.680
them go out hunting together the next day.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.080
We’re gonna come to back that.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.510
Now across the narrow sea there is a completely
separate story going on.

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.350
You see King Robert took the throne from the
Mad King Aerys Targaryen, and two of his kids

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.210
are kind of on the run in exile.

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.500
Cruel Viserys and his uber hot sister Daenerys.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.190
I can say that about the show version because
the actress is over 18, in the books it’s

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:44.280
not cool.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.450
Basically Viserys is gonna marry Dany off
to a savage warlord king called Khal Drogo,

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.750
all of which is made possible by this rich
merchant called Magister Illyrio, so that

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.500
they might take advantage of Drogo’s huge
mounted army in the future and retake the

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:56.680
Crown in Westeros.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.590
Dany’s wedding gift include some fossilised
dragon eggs and when she gets married she’s

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.880
pretty much terrified of this new culture
which makes this seem horribly rapey.

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.150
Right so back over in Westeros up at Winterfell
most of the 2 families, the Starks and the

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.420
Lannisters are out hunting but Brandon stays
at home to climb stuff because it’s his

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:13.520
favourite thing to do.

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.300
But unfortunately it turns out that when nobody’s
about, Queen Cersei and her brother Jamie

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:18.730
like to bang each other!

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.610
Bran sees everything.

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.490
Jamie decides to keep the incest secret by
pushing Bran out the window but the kid doesn’t

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:26.450
die, he just goes into a coma.

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.660
Everyone is real sad about this apparent climbing
accident although Tyrion does have to forcibly

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.220
convince Prince Joffrey to not be shit and
go offer his sympathies.

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.300
And Cersei and Jamie feel super awkward about
the idea that Bran might yet live.

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:42.510
Ned Sansa, Arya and his guard are heading
South with the King to join him as the Hand

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.081
in King’s Landing, while Catelyn stays to
look after Bran and Rickon with Robb put in

00:03:46.081 --> 00:03:47.081
charge.

00:03:47.081 --> 00:03:50.970
Jon can’t go so instead he decides to head
North with his uncle Benjin and join the Night’s

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.450
Watch on the wall to defend the realm from
wildlings.

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.150
Jamie gives him some shit for this but he’s
really only telling it how it is, and Tyrion

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:01.980
decides not to join the rest of the Lannisters
down South immediately, but go take a look

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.010
at the wall himself on a tourist visa.

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.730
Jon gives his favourite sister Arya a small
sword called Needle and says bye to Bran despite

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.030
Catelyn’s frosty reception.

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.260
He asks Ned about his real mystery mother
but Ned promises to talk about that next time

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:15.400
they meet.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.540
Ooo Yikes.

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:20.449
On the road North Tyrion gives Jon some good
advice on seeing things how they really are

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:23.889
because the Night’s Watch is also made up
of criminals given a second chance on the

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:25.620
Wall and its gonna be a hard life.

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.949
Blimey although the view should be pretty
good.

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:32.020
Back at Winterfell an assassin turns up to
finish off Bran but his Direwolf protects

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:33.169
the boy and kills him.

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:37.330
Catelyn is now totally pro-wolf and the Starks
deduce that Bran must have seen something

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.379
in the tower that nearly cost him his life.

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:43.810
The assassin’s knife is a high quality Valyrian
steel blade and seems to lead back to the

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:48.110
Lannisters, so Catelyn decides to travel incognito
to King’s Landing to warn Ned.

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:52.220
Speaking of which, as the King’s party make
their slow way back down it becomes apparent

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:56.510
that sweet prince Joffrey really is a piece
of shit who bullies a common boy to show off

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:00.690
and after taking a knock ends up in a rage
swinging at Arya, threatening to gut her.

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:05.030
Nymeria her Direwolf thinks otherwise of the
situation but the problem is that you can’t

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:07.639
bite a Prince these days without consequences.

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:11.650
Later that night Joff lies to everybody about
how it all went down and Sansa, who just wants

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:15.340
everything to be nice and pretty keeps quiet
and doesn’t back up Arya’s version of

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:16.340
events.

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:20.840
Cersei demands the wolf dead but Arya already
made Nymeria run away so Cersei makes Ned

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.650
kill Sansa’s wolf instead!

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:23.729
What the fuck!

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:27.699
Also that common boy gets slaughtered by the
Prince’s own bodyguard, the Hound, but we’re

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:29.009
more sad about the wolf.

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:32.389
Heading out from Pentos over in the Grass
sea, Dany seems to take strength from her

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:36.139
stone dragon eggs whilst…God that’s not
okay come on!

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:40.449
And as the Khalasar army journeys about, Viserys
and her are joined by a banished Western Knight

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:41.979
called Ser Jorah Mormont.

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:46.010
Dany starts to learn the language a bit and
has a bedslave teach her ways of lovemaking

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:47.960
to help her relationship with Drogo.

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:51.719
This actually works and she starts to feel
a bit better about things when she’s on

00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:52.719
top.

00:05:52.719 --> 00:05:55.969
Ned arrives at King’s Landing and Jamie
reminds him that the King Shits and the Hand

00:05:55.969 --> 00:06:00.120
wipes, Ned returns by bringing up the fact
Jaime is the Kingslayer, the guy who stabbed

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:03.659
the old mad King when he should have been
protecting him, and so Jamie adds that this

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:08.310
is the very spot where the previous mad King
had Ned’s father and brother horribly killed.

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:11.490
So in the context Kingslaying really wasn’t
such a dick move after all.

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:15.229
Then he gets a crash course in bureaucracy
with the small council, Lord Petyr Baelish

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:20.159
master of coin, Grand Maester Pycelle, Lord
Renly Baratheon the King’s younger brother

00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:22.060
and Varys, the master of whispers.

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:25.470
So it turns out the King has been spending
extravagantly like a madman and the crown

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:26.610
is in big debt.

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:31.939
Cersei gives horrible advice to her horrible
son and tells him he must marry Sansa to lock

00:06:31.939 --> 00:06:35.400
down the North legitimately but can do whatever
he wants otherwise.

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.800
Because everybody that’s not us, is our
enemy.

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:41.849
And meanwhile Sansa and Arya still aren’t
getting on so Ned reminds Arya that they need

00:06:41.849 --> 00:06:44.189
to stick together when they are surrounded
by danger.

00:06:44.189 --> 00:06:48.889
He also gets her a swordmaster to teach her
the Water Dance style and this guy Syrio Forel

00:06:48.889 --> 00:06:50.219
is quite the character.

00:06:50.219 --> 00:06:54.610
King Robert can be pretty mean guy when drinking
and even he reminds Jamie about killing the

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:58.120
previous King despite it stopping Aerys burning
down the city.

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:02.240
But never doubt Jaime can fight and he does
have the respect of some of the other Kingsguard

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:03.240
too.

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:07.449
Much to her surprise Littlefinger meets Catelyn
as she enters the city low-key to meet Ned

00:07:07.449 --> 00:07:09.990
because they used to be old friends back when
they were kids.

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:14.060
Varys knows all the secrets it seems but it’s
Littlefinger that claims the dagger meant

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:16.610
to kill Bran belonged to Tyrion Lannister.

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:20.529
Who by the way is enjoying his lovely visit
to the wall which is run by Commander Mormont

00:07:20.529 --> 00:07:24.710
(Jorah’s ded), a great deal more than Jon
Snow is, who’s pretty much getting hazed

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:26.410
solid by his instructor.

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:30.710
And so even Tyrion has to step in to stop
a beat down before reminding Jon that they

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:34.449
haven’t all had his upbringing and that
everybody might want to get along instead.

00:07:34.449 --> 00:07:37.460
And much to their credit they all seem to
take his advice.

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:40.759
Benjen reminds Tyrion that it’s not the
Wildlings North of the wall that he and his

00:07:40.759 --> 00:07:46.050
rangers fear, it’s the threat of other darker
things, but Tyrion doesn’t buy it even when

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:50.039
Maester Aemon and the commander becry the
need of the Night’s Watch for more trained

00:07:50.039 --> 00:07:51.150
men and support.

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:55.279
So Tyrion takes a midnight piss from the top
of the Wall because YOLO and leaves back for

00:07:55.279 --> 00:07:57.610
the South having earned Jon’s respect.

00:07:57.610 --> 00:08:01.180
Bran wakes from his coma and can’t use his
legs anymore, but he also can’t remember

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:05.870
what happened so for now he just has to listen
to old Nan’s stories about fear and Whitewalkers

00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:09.169
and the Long Night when Kings were frozen
in their castles.

00:08:09.169 --> 00:08:13.110
While over in the Khalasarr as they head for
Vaes Dothrak, Jorah tells Dany that Khals

00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:17.559
are often given slaves from big cities as
gifts in order to stop the cities from actually

00:08:17.559 --> 00:08:21.469
getting plundered and Dany orders everybody
to stop so she can think on this and take

00:08:21.469 --> 00:08:22.469
a walk.

00:08:22.469 --> 00:08:26.530
Her stupid cruel brother Viserys flies off
the handle at her for being given an order

00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:30.900
when he’s the King to be, and looses a lot
of credit with the rest of the crowd, even

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:31.900
with Jorah.

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:35.870
You see unlike this dick, Dany is doing her
best to learn the language and embrace the

00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:40.030
culture, and Ser Jorah is a travelled man
who has earned the respect of the Dothraki,

00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:44.200
but once he hears news that Dany is pregnant,
he suddenly has to leave for Qohor without

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:45.270
explanation.

00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:48.790
Bran starts having weird dreams where he’s
pestered by a 3 eyed raven, but has to get

00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:52.531
carried down to the Hall to say hi to Tryion
and Yoren of the Night’s Watch as they pass

00:08:52.531 --> 00:08:54.640
through Winterfell en route to King’s Landing.

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:58.430
Robb gives him a frosty reception but Tryion
draws up plans for a special saddle that can

00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:00.180
allow Bran to still ride a horse.

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:04.080
On his way out Tryion stops to give Theon
a load of shit for essentially being a Greyjoy

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:07.320
hostage and a Stark lackey before he goes
off to get laid.

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:11.290
On the Wall there’s a fat new recruit Sam
Tarley the coward, but Jon’s not into hazing

00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:15.080
the new kids anymore and on the Wall itself
Sam explains he’s always been craven to

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:18.840
the point that his own dad threatened to have
him killed if he didn’t join the Night’s

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:19.840
Watch.

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:22.330
And although some of the rougher new recruits
still need reminding that it’s not cool

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:25.330
to bully each other anymore, the point seems
to get across.

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:29.580
Viserys and Dany reach Vaes Dothrack, The
horselord city, where Viserys talks shit and

00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:31.540
goes on about how this is all his army.

00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:34.990
Jorah tells Dany that if the Dothraki ever
made it to Westeros they could fight King

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:38.270
Robert in the field but aren’t very good
at sieges against castles.

00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:42.590
Viserys talks big to the bed slave about Dragons
forging the Iron Throne, while she mentions

00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:46.590
seeing weird things like pirates and people
who can change their faces (Ooo we’re gonna

00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:50.720
get back to that later) But Viserys spoils
the mood and he then decides to go beat on

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:53.210
Dany a bit for basically giving him gifts!

00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:56.620
But she’s finally had enough of his shit
and slaps him one telling him to back off.

00:09:56.620 --> 00:10:01.660
So Jorah and Dany call it as it is, Old V-dog
is not fit to rule and couldn’t lead the

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:03.990
Dothraki army even if they were given to him.

00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:08.000
Back In the throne room Sansa is still pretty
raw about Ned killing her Direwolf but Ned

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.200
is even less happy as he struggles with the
small council and their bureaucratic B.S.

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:16.190
He enquires after the death of the last hand
Jon Arryn and looks into the book he was studying

00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:18.420
before his suspicious sudden illness.

00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:22.170
Littlefinger explains to Ned that everyone
has spies everywhere, and hints that Ned is

00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:24.600
onto something and offers up further information.

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:28.870
But he does also warn Ned that distrusting
him was the wisest thing he’d done so far.

00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:32.920
So Ned checks on a Smith’s apprentice called
Gendry who Jon Arryn had also spoken to, and

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:36.450
it looks like the former Hand had been taking
an interest in all of King Robert’s bastard

00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:37.450
children.

00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:41.190
There’s a tourney being set up to celebrate
Ned’s new position by command of the King,

00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:45.350
and Littlefinger dials up the creepy to perv
on Sansa for a bit, but one of the guys Ned

00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:49.540
wanted to question in relation to John Arryn’s
death is ‘accidentally’ killed by Ser

00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:52.310
Gregor Clegane, this dude is the Mountain
that rides.

00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:55.270
He’s massive and dangerous and the older
brother of the Hound.

00:10:55.270 --> 00:10:58.990
Things spice up at the inn where Catelyn heading
back up North comes across Tyrion heading

00:10:58.990 --> 00:11:03.300
back down south, and on suspicion of trying
to have Bran murdered she has him taken hostage

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:05.940
by a mixed bag of local men loyal to the Starks.

00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:07.510
Tyrion’s all like- what?

00:11:07.510 --> 00:11:11.470
Day two of the tourney and Ser Loras Tyrell
gives Sansa a rose even though she’s packing

00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:15.620
the wrong type of junk for his liking, and
he then jousts against the Mountain who loses

00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:17.780
due to his horse getting the scent of a mare.

00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:19.430
But this guy is mental.

00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:23.370
So he cuts off his horses head, and then throws
a beat-down on the Knight of Flowers until

00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:25.750
his brother the Hound jumps in to stop him.

00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:30.020
These guys have beef, and it was Ser Gregor
who burned the Hound’s face as a kid.

00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:33.521
The Mountain storms off but Ser Loras praises
the Hound and he clearly doesn’t know how

00:11:33.521 --> 00:11:35.930
to feel about being the good guy for once.

00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:39.880
Loras later tells Renly that maybe he should
be the next King while they get it on, and

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:44.130
Rob and Cersei both agree they hate each other
and that their 17 years of marriage has been

00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:45.200
miserable.

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:48.890
Meanwhile Catelyn’s mixed group of random
knights and sellswords are taking Tyrion over

00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:51.490
to her syster Lysa in the Vale to be tried.

00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:55.560
Tyrion mentions that Lysa is a bit weird these
days but they’re suddenly attacked by wild

00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:56.920
mountain clansmen.

00:11:56.920 --> 00:12:01.170
Instead of making a run for it he helps defend
Catelyn and it also turns out one of the sellswords

00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:03.320
travelling with them is one hell of a killer.

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:07.580
So they just about reach the Vale and yeah
Lysa is pretty weird breastfeeding a son way

00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:09.580
too old for it ah that’s gross!

00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:14.330
And they slap Tyrion in one of the sky cells
Down South Varys confides in Ned that Jon

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:18.660
Arryn was poisoned, administered by the page
who then got knighted and killed, but doesn’t

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:19.860
say on who’s orders.

00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:22.460
Looks like the former Hand had started asking
the wrong questions.

00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:24.570
But Varys’ motives are clouded.

00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:28.200
Because Arya is off chasing cats as part of
her sword training and she ends up in an old

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:32.750
part of the castle with dragon skulls and
overhears and Varys and Magister Illyrio - Talking

00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:36.360
about the imminent war between Starks and
Lannisters, but that it’s happening all

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:39.950
too soon For Drogo’s army and the Targaryen
kids to make use of it.

00:12:39.950 --> 00:12:43.500
Then Littlefinger and Varys have a who knows
more secrets than who showdown, and it’s

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:46.670
casually interrupted by Renly because Robert
is fuming.

00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:50.130
He’s just heard that Dany is now pregnant
and could be a threat to his kingdom, and

00:12:50.130 --> 00:12:54.080
it turns out Ser Jorah has been feeding the
crown information in hopes of a pardon for

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:55.710
his own crime of selling slaves.

00:12:55.710 --> 00:13:00.130
Ned thinks child murder is a dick move but
Robert really hates Targaryens and the council

00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:03.880
agree that the girl should die for the sake
of the greater good.

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:08.030
Ned quits and is on his way out, but Jaime
has gotten wind of Catelyn kidnapping his

00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:13.350
brother, so he steps up and kills Ned’s
number 2 guy and oh shit - It’s on!

00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:17.630
These two are both powerful swordsmen going
at it but then this random prick sStabs Ned

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:20.090
in the leg and spoils the moment for Jaime.

00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:23.980
So Jamie has left the capitol and Ned’s
in bed with a broken leg and the King demands

00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:26.150
Tyrion’s release before things get worse.

00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:29.870
He reinstates Ned back as the Hand and goes
off hunting to clear his mind – while he’s

00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:34.420
out there though his Lannister squire is making
sure that he stays suspiciously drunk.

00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:38.490
In Bran’s dreams the three-eyed raven seems
to want to show him something but Hodor, the

00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:42.450
big dumb friendly houseboy who can only say
his own name -asterisk, turns up with that

00:13:42.450 --> 00:13:46.240
special saddle so he goes off into the woods
for a ride with Robb and Theon.

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:49.790
Theon tries to convince Robb to go to war
with the Lannisters but bran is accosted by

00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:52.140
wildlings who try to steal his horse.

00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:55.530
Stark fights and Greyjoy shoots killing all
but one who they take as a prisoner.

00:13:55.530 --> 00:13:59.540
Up in the Vale in the castle Eyrie Tyrion
talks his way out of the cell to stand before

00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:02.800
an audience and demand trial by combat in
response to the allegations.

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:07.000
In a hall surrounded by enemies everybody’s
up for killing a dwarf, But Tyrion’s risky

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:12.110
bet pays off when the sellsword who was travelling
with them steps up for sake of Lannister gold.

00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:17.000
This guy Bronn is a mean lean killing machine
and wears down Lysa’s champion before the

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.000
kill.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.200
The two of them say their goodbyes and start
the dangerous journey home.

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:24.080
In the sacred city of Vaes Dothrak, Dany is
really getting into the idea of heating up

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:28.830
those stone dragon eggs and realises that
as a Targaryen she’s kinda immune to fire.

00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:32.960
She then eats a whole horse’s heart in ritual
to prove the worth her unborn son.

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:36.210
Who the witches now claim will be the stallion
that mounts the world.

00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:39.650
Viserys gets super jelly and tries to sell
her Dragon eggs to buy another army.

00:14:39.650 --> 00:14:44.390
Jorah says no, so instead he gets really drunk,
demands that Khal Drogo win him the crown

00:14:44.390 --> 00:14:47.500
he was promised and threatens Dany’s unborn
baby.

00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:52.140
This doesn’t go down so well so Drogo gives
him a crown molten gold right then and there.

00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:55.500
It seems that since leaving King’s Landing
the Mountain has been raping and pillaging

00:14:55.500 --> 00:15:00.110
the Riverlands with his men, and the smallfolk
seek justice from Ned while the King is away.

00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:04.150
Ned sends Lord Beric Dondarrion and a force
of men to bring him to justice, but he knows

00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:08.680
that it’s probably head of House Lannister,
Lord Tywin who’s really giving the orders.

00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:13.060
Joffrey plays the charming card on Sansa who
laps it up and promises she will be queen

00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:14.060
someday.

00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:17.310
But sensing danger and impending war Ned tells
his girls they’re going home.

00:15:17.310 --> 00:15:21.800
Sansa blurts out about wanting golden haired
children with Joffrey and the penny drops.

00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:26.220
That book Jon Arryn was reading was all about
Baratheon lineage, describing black hair every

00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:28.910
time just like Gendry and the King’s other
bastards.

00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:32.960
Looks like these Lannister gold children are
not the King’s own blood after all.

00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:37.110
In the field Lord Tywin Lannister gives his
son Jamie grief for leaving Ned alive, but

00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:42.020
also gives him command of half of their forces
in the upcoming war, as family name is everything

00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:43.150
to Tywin.

00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:46.820
Stupid old honourable Ned tells Cersei that
he knows about her incest children and that

00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:49.730
King Robert will go berserk when he’s back
from the hunt.

00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:53.290
Instead of fleeing the city however the Queen
is just like yeah so what, I play the game

00:15:53.290 --> 00:15:55.080
of thrones to win or die.

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:56.580
On the wall they’ve passed their training.

00:15:56.580 --> 00:16:00.030
So the new recruits say their vows in front
of a heart tree and become Brothers of the

00:16:00.030 --> 00:16:01.030
Night’s Watch.

00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:04.450
But instead of being made a ranger John is
made a steward to the Lord Commander.

00:16:04.450 --> 00:16:08.120
He really wanted to scout beyond the wall
because Jon’s Uncle Benjen is missing now

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:11.100
from a Northern ranging, with only his horse
returning.

00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:15.250
But Sam tells him to wise up and realise he’s
likely being groomed for command.

00:16:15.250 --> 00:16:19.280
Once their vows are done though his direwolf
Ghost finds the dead bodies of two other Black

00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:21.390
Brothers who also went out with Benjen.

00:16:21.390 --> 00:16:25.910
On their travels the Khalsar visits a market,
and Jorah in secret receives his pardon from

00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:26.910
the crown.

00:16:26.910 --> 00:16:30.460
But he’s really into Dany by now and despite
being a spy doesn’t want her dead.

00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:34.810
So when a suspicious travelling merchant offers
Dany a cask of poisoned wine, Jorah makes

00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:37.180
him take a sip of it first, saving her life.

00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:41.910
And oddly it’s this very assassination attempt
that angers Drogo enough to finally turn his

00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:46.680
wandering army around and head back towards
Westeros to take the crown in revenge.

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:50.670
Robert is back from the hunt, but he was so
drunk that he got mortally wounded by a boar

00:16:50.670 --> 00:16:51.720
and now he’s dying.

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:55.640
He decrees that Ned be in charge of the Kingdom
when he’s gone until Prince Joffrey comes

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:56.640
of age.

00:16:56.640 --> 00:17:00.170
On a technicality Ned actually writes down
‘rightful heir’ instead of Joffrey and

00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:03.950
Ser Bariston Selmy, commander of the Kingsguard
laments not protecting the king.

00:17:03.950 --> 00:17:06.749
Renly advises Ned to make a move against Cersei
immediately.

00:17:06.749 --> 00:17:11.329
But Ned is stubborn and all about the rules
and knows that Stannis, Renly’s older and

00:17:11.329 --> 00:17:13.990
oddly absent brother is next in line as King.

00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:17.770
So he sends word to Dragonstone to tell Stannis
it’s time to step up.

00:17:17.770 --> 00:17:21.640
Everyone tells Ned he’s being naïve, and
Ned mentions that the royal children are bastards,

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:25.280
and that he needs Littlefinger’s help in
making sure the City Guard are on his side

00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:26.779
when the shit goes down.

00:17:26.779 --> 00:17:30.629
Problem - Littlefinger still fancies Catelyn
and holds a grudge against the Starks since

00:17:30.629 --> 00:17:34.410
the days of his childhood, a guy like him
can’t win by the rules of swords, but can

00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:38.769
win by screwing over people with commerce
and politics, so he agrees to have Ned’s

00:17:38.769 --> 00:17:40.911
back -
But when the time comes and Ned and his men

00:17:40.911 --> 00:17:45.129
step into the throne room to declare Joffrey
a bastard without claim, the City Guard turn

00:17:45.129 --> 00:17:48.100
around and kill his own men, with Ned being
taken prisoner.

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:50.629
So things didn’t really go down as planned.

00:17:50.629 --> 00:17:54.429
Across the capitol Lannisters are suddenly
Killing Starks, and Sansa runs for her room

00:17:54.429 --> 00:17:55.840
where she’s caught by the Hound.

00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:59.809
Arya is in the middle of a sword fighting
lesson however and Syrio Forel isn’t convinced

00:17:59.809 --> 00:18:01.080
about handing her over.

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:06.029
So he gives her his final lesson and sweeps
up the trash before sacrificing himself.

00:18:06.029 --> 00:18:07.999
Like if you cry every time.

00:18:07.999 --> 00:18:12.440
In the chaos and turmoil, Arya grabs Needle,
kills a stable-boy and escapes the castle

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:15.669
into the city by a secret passage she found
when chasing cats.

00:18:15.669 --> 00:18:18.720
Ned’s slapped in the black cells and all
his men are dead.

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:22.740
And In a dick move Cersei and the new King
dismiss the Barriston Selmy from the Kingsguard,

00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:24.139
and he’s not impressed.

00:18:24.139 --> 00:18:28.080
Renly too has fled the capitol, but Cersei
and the rest of the small council coheres

00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:32.259
Sansa into writing a letter to Robb telling
him to come down and swear loyalty to King

00:18:32.259 --> 00:18:33.259
Joffrey.

00:18:33.259 --> 00:18:36.429
Robb’s gonna come South alright, but he’s
going to take the armies of the North with

00:18:36.429 --> 00:18:37.429
him.

00:18:37.429 --> 00:18:40.350
He callshis banners of the North together
and Greatjon Umber takes a little bit of convincing

00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:44.999
to follow the young Lord, but after a wolf
bite or two becomes Robb’s staunchest supporter.

00:18:44.999 --> 00:18:48.270
So he goes to war technically leaving Bran
in charge at Winterfell.

00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:52.390
Their wildling captive Osha, has kind of fallen
into place working round the castle and talks

00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:56.610
to Bran about truths and hearing the old gods
and the winter threat beyond the wall.

00:18:56.610 --> 00:19:00.400
In the Castle Eyrie Catelyn is unhappy that
Lysa won’t back her up with the knights

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:02.120
of the Vale if the Starks go to war.

00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:06.009
She seems to fear conflict with the Lannisters
and is essentially useless.

00:19:06.009 --> 00:19:09.920
And mean whilst heading home from there, Tyrion
and Bronn are accosted by the same mountain

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:14.210
clansmen who gave them grief on the way in,
but Tyrion’s power is his wit and his words

00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:18.550
and he manages to talk them into escorting
them safely back to the Lannister army, promising

00:19:18.550 --> 00:19:21.830
them the weapons that they need to take the
Vale for themselves.

00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:22.990
Because screw those guys.

00:19:22.990 --> 00:19:26.190
On the Wall there’s something odd about
those ranger corpses found near the Heart

00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:27.190
Tree.

00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:28.980
The odd thing being that they’re actually
undead.

00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:32.019
They rise up in the middle of the night and
attack Jon and the Lord Commander.

00:19:32.019 --> 00:19:36.090
They don’t die by traditional means but
they do thankfully burn well.

00:19:36.090 --> 00:19:40.110
Across the sea Drogo’s Khalasar is on the
warpath now, and heading back West, and it’s

00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:43.740
raping and pillaging and taking slaves to
sell on to pay for ships.

00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:47.039
Dany doesn’t like the cruel truth of this
and puts a stop to the raping by claiming

00:19:47.039 --> 00:19:48.039
all of the women.

00:19:48.039 --> 00:19:53.100
Drogo is amused but some of his men aren’t,
so he kills this mug and takes a wound that

00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:57.529
one of the spared women, a healer by trade,
offers to patch up in gratitude to Dany.

00:19:57.529 --> 00:20:01.240
Catelyn meets up with Robb’s army in the
Riverlands planning for war, and Tyrion meets

00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:05.140
up with Tywin’s army to say hi to his dad
and uncle, bringing the mountain clansmen

00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:06.140
along with him.

00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:10.090
Tywin never misses an opportunity and gets
the clansman to fight for him alongside Tyrion

00:20:10.090 --> 00:20:11.590
in the upcoming battle.

00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:14.570
Robb is marching South but needs to cross
the river at The Twins.

00:20:14.570 --> 00:20:18.860
This place is owned by the vulture Walder
Frey, who is technically on their side but

00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:20.509
really only looks out for himself.

00:20:20.509 --> 00:20:24.019
He agrees to the crossing and joining the
war but only so long as Robb marries one of

00:20:24.019 --> 00:20:25.019
his many daughters.

00:20:25.019 --> 00:20:28.110
A shit deal for Robb but off they cross in
full force.

00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:32.080
For protecting him against zombies the Lord
Commander gives Jon with his Valyrian steel

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:36.190
sword, but Jon finds out about his brother
going to war for his father and wants to desert

00:20:36.190 --> 00:20:37.190
and help.

00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:40.210
Thankfully his other new brothers of the watch
convince him to stay and follow duty.

00:20:40.210 --> 00:20:44.809
And it turns out Maester Aemon was in fact
Targaryen Royalty who also chose the hard

00:20:44.809 --> 00:20:46.369
path of remaining on the Wall.

00:20:46.369 --> 00:20:49.919
Tyrion and the tribesmen are going in the
front lines and it seems that Tywin isn’t

00:20:49.919 --> 00:20:53.330
too worried about Tyrion’s survival in general
which kills his appetite.

00:20:53.330 --> 00:20:56.870
It comes back pretty quickly though as Bronn
has found him a cheeky little whore called

00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:59.019
Shae who has a quick wit to match his.

00:20:59.019 --> 00:21:03.350
But beware like Bronn the sellsword this is
very much a business situation for her.

00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:04.440
Next day they join the battle.

00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:07.460
Tyrion gets knocked out pretty early but it
turns out they won.

00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:11.649
But this is because it wasn’t the full Stark
army heading down to fight but just 1/10th

00:21:11.649 --> 00:21:13.470
of the force as a diversion.

00:21:13.470 --> 00:21:17.330
Robb had led the rest of the force in a surprise
attack that took Jamie Lannister’s force

00:21:17.330 --> 00:21:19.450
and the Kingslayer himself captive.

00:21:19.450 --> 00:21:23.379
Turns out that despite being treated Drogo’s
wound did not heal at all and has in fact

00:21:23.379 --> 00:21:24.379
festered.

00:21:24.379 --> 00:21:27.539
He falls from his horse, and it’s too late
even for the healer to help him now.

00:21:27.539 --> 00:21:31.720
She does further mention however that she’s
also trained in blood magic as a Magei.

00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:36.389
Desperate, Dany consents to some dark sacrifice
shit and this really splits the crowd forcing

00:21:36.389 --> 00:21:40.019
Jorah to Kill a Bloodrider while Dany suddenly
goes into premature labour.

00:21:40.019 --> 00:21:42.870
Jorah unwisely takes her to the Magei for
further help.

00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:47.280
In the black cells Ned wants to stick to the
honourable truth but Varys convinces him to

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:51.440
recant his accusations against Joffrey because
making sure that his children aren’t harmed

00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:53.679
is a kind of honourable thing to do too.

00:21:53.679 --> 00:21:56.429
So Ned aggress to say he was wrong for the
sake of family.

00:21:56.429 --> 00:22:00.369
Arya is living like a hobo in the city and
joins the crowd to see Ned, Cersei and the

00:22:00.369 --> 00:22:02.830
King put on a show, with Ned as the traitor
villain.

00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:07.020
He spies his daughter and manages to put Yoren
on to her in passing and Cersei and co.

00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:11.279
promise Sansa that they’ll let Ned live
for his confession and join the Nights Watch.

00:22:11.279 --> 00:22:14.590
But Joffrey is cruel to the core and demands
his head anyway.

00:22:14.590 --> 00:22:18.840
Yoren makes Arya look away when it happens,
and everyone including us come to realise

00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:20.990
that anyone can die in this show.

00:22:20.990 --> 00:22:25.350
Yoren is rough but his gameplan is to pretend
Arya is a boy entering the Night’s Watch

00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:26.960
and to sneak her back to Winterfell.

00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:30.510
‘Arry’ will be travelling up with the
other criminals but Gendry has been sent to

00:22:30.510 --> 00:22:31.610
join the watch too.

00:22:31.610 --> 00:22:35.730
In Bran’s dream the three-eyed raven leads
to the crypts, so he real life heads down

00:22:35.730 --> 00:22:38.419
with Osha and talks of dreaming of Ned being
there.

00:22:38.419 --> 00:22:42.389
Seems Rickon had the same dream too, before
Maester Luwin receives official word of his

00:22:42.389 --> 00:22:43.389
death.

00:22:43.389 --> 00:22:47.250
Catelyn and Robb also grieve at the loss of
Ned, swearing vengeance on the Lannisters.

00:22:47.250 --> 00:22:51.019
But Catelyn wants to make sure Sansa and Arya
are back safe too.

00:22:51.019 --> 00:22:54.879
Word on the street is that Renly is now also
now laying claim to the throne, ahead of his

00:22:54.879 --> 00:22:56.210
older brother Stannis.

00:22:56.210 --> 00:22:59.990
But while they’re all together the Northern
Lords suggest Robb might as well be King of

00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:03.389
North, essentially breaking Westeros into
two kingdoms.

00:23:03.389 --> 00:23:07.590
In captivity Jamie admits pushing Bran out
the window but doesn’t say exactly why.

00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:11.590
Tywin and his war council talk of how both
Baratheon brothers are now claiming the throne

00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:15.860
as next in line, and Tyrion adds that all
chances of peace with the North (who are now

00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:18.470
winning), were ruined when Joff decided to
kill Ned.

00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:22.409
Tywin tells Tyrion that he might have underestimated
his other son and that he’s sending him

00:23:22.409 --> 00:23:26.490
to King’s Landing as Hand of the king to
basically run things and keep Joffrey and

00:23:26.490 --> 00:23:27.490
Cersei in line.

00:23:27.490 --> 00:23:31.299
But adds he’s not allowed to take his whore
along with him, because these some bad history

00:23:31.299 --> 00:23:32.299
there.

00:23:32.299 --> 00:23:33.649
But screw that- Tyrion is gonna take her anyway.

00:23:33.649 --> 00:23:38.269
In the capitol we get an odd insight into
Grand Maester Pycelle not truly being as old

00:23:38.269 --> 00:23:39.950
and doddering as he might appear.

00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:44.289
And another moment between Varys and Littlefinger,
they both separately seem to be orchestrating

00:23:44.289 --> 00:23:46.360
some big secret schemes.

00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:49.700
Meanwhile Joffrey is having fun cutting off
people’s tongues, but stops for a moment

00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:52.990
to force Sansa to come and take a look at
the severed head of her father.

00:23:52.990 --> 00:23:55.419
Mother says he’s still to marry Sansa and
shouldn’t hit her.

00:23:55.419 --> 00:23:57.240
So he has the Kingsguard hit her instead.

00:23:57.240 --> 00:24:00.960
It looks like she’s about to push Joffrey
off the ledge but the Hound intervenes making

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:03.240
it seem to tend to her cut.

00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:07.519
Commander Mormont reports of talk of the wildlings
North of the wall forming a massive army,

00:24:07.519 --> 00:24:09.610
and even more tell of the dead walking.

00:24:09.610 --> 00:24:13.989
This shit is far more important than Kings
going to war, so he announces he’s leading

00:24:13.989 --> 00:24:17.570
the Night’s Watch North into wildling territory
to discover what’s going on.

00:24:17.570 --> 00:24:21.340
Dany wakes from the awful night and Jorah
tells her she lost the child.

00:24:21.340 --> 00:24:26.369
The Magei adding that it was born monstrous
and twisted, a lizard boy full of grey worms.

00:24:26.369 --> 00:24:28.649
This was the price of death to pay for Drogo’s
life.

00:24:28.649 --> 00:24:33.200
But it gets worse, all of the Khalasar army
except the stragglers have left, and Drogo

00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:36.529
is technically alive but otherwise braindead
and sightless.

00:24:36.529 --> 00:24:40.490
The sorceress admits that this was all part
of her plan to stop Dany’s child being the

00:24:40.490 --> 00:24:44.489
Stallion that mounts the world, and saving
countless people from future war.

00:24:44.489 --> 00:24:49.360
So Dany in tears puts Drogo out of his misery
and builds a pyre to burn the body along with

00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:51.720
the Sorceress, her eggs and herself.

00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:55.809
Jorah pleads for her not to commit suicide,
but that’s not actually Dany’s plan.

00:24:55.809 --> 00:25:00.419
Through the fires of sacrifice she emerges
unscathed, her eggs all hatched, and surrounded

00:25:00.419 --> 00:25:01.960
by three Dragons.

00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:04.119
Oh my God!

00:25:04.119 --> 00:25:08.080
So Ned’s dead, the North is at war with
the South, and as well as Stark V Lannister

00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:11.450
Robert’s two other brothers are somewhere
claiming the throne as well.

00:25:11.450 --> 00:25:16.539
Joffrey rules with cruelty keeping Sansa hostage,
and Tyrion heading over for damage limitation.

00:25:16.539 --> 00:25:19.639
Jamie is captured and Arya is pretending to
be a boy amongst criminals.

00:25:19.639 --> 00:25:46.500
While Jon is marching North of the wall and
thanks to Dany, Dragons live once again.
