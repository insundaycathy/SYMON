00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.510
Hey everyone. Welcome back to Movie Recap.
Today I'm gonna show you a 2013 American science

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:15.719
fiction monster film called, Pacific Rim.

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:21.330
The film begins in 2013. Deep beneath the
Pacific Ocean, a fissure opens up that leads

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.180
to another dimension. Through the fissure
a giant monster appears, and destroys portions

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:32.180
of San Francisco. After several days and countless
lives, the creature is defeated by human military

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:33.720
forces.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:39.059
However, what seemed to be an isolated attack
builds as more creatures begin to come through

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.960
the fissure, attacking coastal cities around
the Pacific. The world unites to stop the

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:49.040
invaders, and develop the Jaeger Program:
a series of giant mechanical 'monsters,' intended

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:54.240
to stop the creatures. Original tests to have
one pilot per Jaeger prove unsuccessful, as

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.649
the test subjects were not able to handle
the stress and strain of controlling such

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:04.780
a huge robot by themselves. It was then decided
that each Jaeger would be piloted by two pilots,

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.500
their memories linked together in the "Drift",
synchronizing their movements to maneuver

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.400
the massive machines.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.680
As the Jaegers go to work, they begin to turn
the tide, and take down the creatures which

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.209
are named "Kaiju". Pretty soon, the world
is enthralled by the Jaegers and their pilots.

00:01:22.209 --> 00:01:27.670
They become celebrities, and even have merchandise
made. As well, the dead Kaiju are soon seen

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.219
as a black-market commodity, their parts sold
off for various collections and medicinal

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:38.029
purposes, though many of their bodily fluids
are toxic and cause severe environmental pollution.

00:01:38.029 --> 00:01:42.549
But just as the war seems to be turning in
humanity's favor, the Kaiju's attacks become

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:45.270
more frequent and more brutal.

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:52.409
In 2020, seven years after the fissure opened,
one of the more famous Jaeger duos, Raleigh

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.069
Beckett, and his older brother, Yancy have
become heroes with an impeccable record of

00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:01.969
defeating Kaijus. Pilots of the Jaeger named
"Gipsy Danger," they are sent off to stop

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:07.360
a category 3 Kaiju heading towards Anchorage.
The beast is larger and more powerful than

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.239
previous category 3s and will be a challenge
for the team. Though the information on their

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.140
monitors shows a fishing boat in the path
of the attack, the Becketts are told their

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.680
priority is to protect Anchorage.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.269
Disobeying orders, the two still save the
fishing boat, but end up being brutally attacked

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:30.730
by the Kaiju, which rips off the Gipsy Danger's
left arm, and tears away a chunk of the vehicle's

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.810
helmet, sending Yancy to his death. Raleigh
barely manages to pilot Gipsy Danger on his

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:41.590
own and finishes the battle, using the robot's
giant plasma blaster to kill the creature.

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.000
Raleigh later pilots the Jaeger to a remote
beach where it finally collapses. Raleigh

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.799
walks out, bearing injuries from the battle
because of the Drift, Jaeger pilots experience

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:56.300
the same injuries that their mechanical counterparts
do and collapses on the beach too, exhausted

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.660
and emotionally devastated from his brother's
death.

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.040
After the attack, Raleigh leaves the Jaeger
Program, and goes to find work wherever he

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:11.120
can. Five years later, he finds work along
the Western coast of the United States as

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.719
a construction worker, helping build a giant
coastal wall that is meant to keep the Kaiju

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:18.019
out.

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:22.319
In the 5 years since Raleigh was with the
Jaeger program, numerous countries have called

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:27.189
for the program to be terminated due to spiraling
casualties of Jaeger pilots in the increased

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:32.629
Kaiju attacks and the enormous cost of keeping
it funded. Many assume that building the coastal

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:37.209
barriers will make them safe, but the head
of the program, Stacker Pentecost, claims

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:41.640
that the world's leaders are making a terrible
mistake. Even though Pentecost claims the

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:47.170
program is still viable, it is relocated to
Hong Kong and given 8 months of funding before

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:52.030
the program will be permanently retired.

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:57.030
Working on the wall near Sitka, Alaska, Raleigh
sees television reports that a Kaiju has broken

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.930
through the wall surrounding Sydney Harbor
in Australia. Luckily, a Jaeger named Striker

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.870
Eureka is able to take it down. After seeing
the news report, Raleigh is surprised when

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:12.209
a helicopter lands near his construction area,
with Pentecost requesting he come along. Raleigh

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:17.120
is reluctant to join the Jaeger program again,
however, Pentecost convinces him that he belongs

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.750
in the pilot's seat.

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.580
Raleigh is then flown to the Hong Kong Base,
known as 'The Shatterdome', where he meets

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:29.680
Mako Mori. Mako tells Raleigh that she has
studied his moves during his years in action

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.479
as a Jaeger pilot, Raleigh notes she seems
apprehensive.

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:39.880
Pentecost also introduces Raleigh to two scientists
under their command. One of them, Dr Newton

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.330
Geiszler, is an obsessive 'Kaiju Fanboy,'
who studies the creatures through salvaged

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:50.470
organs and other parts. The other is Dr. Gottlieb,
who is a more 'practical' man, using his mathematical

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:57.570
knowledge to try and pinpoint the frequency
of creatures coming through the ocean rift.

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:01.530
Within the Shatterdome, the last remaining
Jaegers and their crews have been assembled:

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:07.211
The 3-pilot Crimson Typhoon, from China, Cherno
Alpha, from Russia, Striker Eureka, fresh

00:05:07.211 --> 00:05:12.910
from its stint in Australia, and, to Raleigh's
surprise, Gipsy Danger. However, since her

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:20.669
encounter 5 years ago, she has been rebuilt
and retrofitted for more extreme combat.

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:25.660
Raleigh questions Pentecost on just what their
plan is. Pentecost explains that are formulating

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:31.390
a plan to drop a nuclear weapon into the channel
between dimensions. If it works, the channel

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:36.199
will be destroyed, stopping any further Kaiju
from coming through. Though the plan of attacking

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:40.840
the channel has failed in the past, the program's
leaders are confident they will be successful

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:47.150
this time if all the remaining Jaegers attack
simultaneously.

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:52.710
Pentecost soon after meets again with Geiszler
and Gottlieb. Gottlieb predicts that mathematically,

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:57.490
the number of Kaiju coming up through the
rift is increasing. Geiszler meanwhile, wonders

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:02.129
if they can learn more about the Kaiju, if
they are able to 'drift' with its brain. Having

00:06:02.129 --> 00:06:07.150
a portion of one, he is eager to test his
theory, but is denied by Pentecost, who decides

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:11.539
to follow Gottlieb's research.

00:06:11.539 --> 00:06:16.121
Without his brother, Raleigh is tasked with
helping to find a replacement. However, during

00:06:16.121 --> 00:06:20.930
a training and reflex exercise, Raleigh becomes
irritated when Mako keeps calling him out

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:25.840
regarding the number of moves to take down
his opponent. Inquiring why she is being so

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:29.860
vocal, she responds that he could have taken
down his opponents with a shorter amount of

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:34.970
moves. After winning approval from Pentecost,
Raleigh spars with her and is amazed at her

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:41.759
prowess. He proclaims that she should help
him co-pilot Gipsy Danger, but Pentecost refuses.

00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:48.440
Eventually, another pilot is chosen for Raleigh,
but at the last minute, Mako is given permission.

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:53.629
A test-run of Gipsy Danger within the Shatterdome
appears to be going well, until during the

00:06:53.629 --> 00:06:59.039
Drift session, Mako gets locked into a tragic
memory and almost sets off the Jaeger's plasma

00:06:59.039 --> 00:07:02.720
cannon within the dome.

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:07.289
Following the incident, Raleigh understands
more about Mako and Pentecost. When Mako was

00:07:07.289 --> 00:07:12.540
a child, she lost her family to a Kaiju attack
in Tokyo. Just when it seemed the creature

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:17.259
was going to kill her, a Jaeger was deployed
that stopped it. The pilot of the Jaeger was

00:07:17.259 --> 00:07:22.000
Pentecost himself. Even with her becoming
unfocused in the drift, Raleigh still wants

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.220
Mako as his partner, but is again rebuffed
by Pentecost.

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:33.960
Meanwhile, Dr. Geiszler has hooked up a crude
connection machine, and hooks into the Kaiju

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:38.890
brain in his lab. The strain of the drift
is quite overwhelming for Geiszler and Gottlieb

00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:43.889
shuts it down. Geiszler reports to Pentecost
and his men that the link allowed him a glimpse

00:07:43.889 --> 00:07:48.979
into the other side of the portal. Geiszler
had theorized that based on some Kaiju samples,

00:07:48.979 --> 00:07:52.629
that what they were seeing coming through
were cloned creatures, and his drift vision

00:07:52.629 --> 00:07:58.409
appears to corroborate the theory. Unfortunately,
the Kaiju brain has been damaged, and Geiszler

00:07:58.409 --> 00:08:03.629
needs a fresher brain in order to learn more.
Pentecost gives him a small card, and sends

00:08:03.629 --> 00:08:06.161
him to Hong Kong to look for a man named Hannibal
Chau.

00:08:06.161 --> 00:08:07.161
Geiszler finds Chau, who is actually an American
going under an alias. Chau is a dealer in

00:08:07.161 --> 00:08:08.161
Kaiju remains, collecting them from battle
sites and dealing them on the black market.

00:08:08.161 --> 00:08:09.161
Geiszler is sufficiently impressed with Chau's
secret room containing live specimens that

00:08:09.161 --> 00:08:10.161
could be useful in his research. Geiszler
tells Chau that he wants an intact brain.

00:08:10.161 --> 00:08:11.161
Chau balks at the idea since recovering a
Kaiju brain is nearly impossible, the skull

00:08:11.161 --> 00:08:12.161
bone of a Kaiju is too thick to penetrate
quickly and the brains become useless when

00:08:12.161 --> 00:08:13.161
contaminated with ammonia. Geiszler still
bats around Chau's arrogance and questioning

00:08:13.161 --> 00:08:14.161
demeanor, saying that he can use a Kaiju's
secondary brain instead. He mentions how he

00:08:14.161 --> 00:08:15.161
drifted with a Kaiju brain, leading Chau to
question that if he connected to the other

00:08:15.161 --> 00:08:16.161
side, what's to say those on the other side
don't know what he now knows? Chau reveals

00:08:16.161 --> 00:08:17.161
that he'd also drifted with a Kaiju brain
and the result was permanent injury to his

00:08:17.161 --> 00:08:18.161
left eye and the danger that the aliens can
send any Kaiju to find him in the city.

00:08:18.161 --> 00:08:19.161
Shortly after their discussion, two Category
4 Kaijus surface near Hong Kong. Pentecost

00:08:19.161 --> 00:08:20.161
sends out Crimson Typhoon and the Cherno Alpha
to fight the creatures, with Striker Eureka

00:08:20.161 --> 00:08:25.720
as backup to protect the City's coastline.

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:29.800
Just as discussion had seemed to point to
the Kaiju becoming more dangerous, the two

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:34.530
that have emerged come with extra accoutrements.
One possesses a pouch in its throat containing

00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:39.790
acid that melts away Cherno Alpha's armor,
severely disabling it. Crimson Typhoon's crew

00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:45.130
take her into the fight, but she is soon overwhelmed
by one of the Kaiju that uses a clawed tail

00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:53.660
to rip off the jaeger's head. Cherno is attacked
by the larger of the two Kaiju and defeated

00:08:53.660 --> 00:09:00.760
when they're forced underwater and the monster
crushes their reactor, drowning both pilots.

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:05.670
The father/son team piloting Striker Eureka
abandon their orders to protect Hong Kong,

00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:10.720
and go at the creatures. However, the other
Kaiju lets loose an EMP burst that disables

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:16.780
Striker Eureka, and the equipment in the Shatterdome.
With 2 hours until the system can be rebooted,

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:20.770
Striker Eureka is dead in the water until
Raleigh offers a solution: though the newer

00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:29.620
models of Jaeger are digital, the Gypsy Danger
is analog and thus more resistant to EMP attacks.

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:34.380
Pentecost sends out Raleigh and Mako, who
end up destroying the EMP-armed Kaiju after

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:42.140
a protracted battle, but the other one ends
up heading into Hong Kong.

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:46.340
While Chau and his associates have fled to
their bunker, Dr. Geiszler has been thrown

00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:51.480
out into the streets by Chau to hide in a
public fallout shelter. However, when it sounds

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:56.130
like the creature has settled directly over
them, he begins to panic that Chau may have

00:09:56.130 --> 00:10:00.660
been right, and that it may be looking for
him. As if to answer that the ceiling caves

00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:05.190
in, and the Kaiju attempts to reach him.

00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:10.540
Just then Gipsy Danger appears and distracts
the Kaiju. The battle goes through many buildings,

00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:15.580
and Gipsy is able to freeze and shatter the
creature's tail and tear out it's acid sac.

00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:20.280
However, the battle takes a turn when the
creature suddenly sprouts giant wings and

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:25.321
begins to carry the Jaeger into Earth's upper
atmosphere. Utilizing a new weapon, a large

00:10:25.321 --> 00:10:30.190
chain-sword, they manage to destroy it before
plummeting back to Earth, barely regaining

00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:36.350
control of the Jaeger as a team to make a
safe landing.

00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:40.290
Raleigh and Mako return to the Shatterdome
to cheers as the pilots of the Eureka also

00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:45.380
voice their thanks and appreciation. During
the jubilation, Raleigh notes Pentecost bleeding

00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:51.190
slightly from both nostrils. In private, Pentecost
explains how, in the earlier days of the Jaeger

00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:56.040
program, shielding from nuclear contaminants
had not been considered and that his condition

00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:58.550
has been worsening over time.

00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:04.700
Meanwhile, Geiszler has returned to Chau and
demands claim over the dead Kaiju's secondary

00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:10.310
brain. Chau's men attempt to get to it, but
find it damaged and useless. However, they

00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:14.870
also discover the Kaiju is actually pregnant
before their communication link with Chau

00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:19.670
goes dead. Just then, an infant Kaiju breaks
through a slit in the side of its Mother,

00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:24.530
and attempts to escape before falling down,
seemingly choking on its own umbilical cord.

00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:29.200
As Chau gloats over the dead infant Kaiju,
claiming he'd known it couldn't survive very

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:34.180
long outside it's mother, the creature rears
up and swallows him whole, finally dying in

00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:37.460
the street.

00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:42.380
Dr Gottlieb soon shows up in Hong Kong with
Geiszler's machine, and though the first attempt

00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:47.100
almost killed him, Gottlieb volunteers to
drift with the other scientist, to cooperate

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:51.560
in learning more through the infant Kaiju's
brain and handle the strain of the experience

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:54.490
together.

00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:58.660
Plans are soon made to set up the Gipsy Danger
and Striker Eureka to deliver the warhead

00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:04.180
to the undersea rift. With his father unable
to pilot Striker due to a broken arm, Herc

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:09.380
Hansen is left without a partner. Pentecost
surprises everyone when he takes the role.

00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:14.130
However, the strain of piloting a Jaeger could
prove fatal to Pentecost, but he volunteers

00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:16.960
anyway.

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:21.680
As the two Jaegers near the rift, Geiszler
and Gottlieb rush into the Shatterdome's control

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:27.000
room, and explain that the plan will not work.
The channel between dimensions will only allow

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.740
in a Kaiju, the very reason for the previous
failures to destroy the channel with other

00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:36.240
nuclear weapons: if they attempt to drop the
warhead into the channel, it'll just deflect

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:41.700
off the breach. The two Jaegers battle two
Category 4 Kaiju guarding the rift as a third

00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:49.700
Kaiju, a Category 5, larger and more powerful
than the previous creatures, emerges.

00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:54.580
Gipsy Danger and Striker Eureka sustain heavy
damage in the battle. Unable to deliver the

00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:59.610
bomb, Striker Eureka detonates it to take
out the defending Kaiju and give Gipsy Danger

00:12:59.610 --> 00:13:05.430
a chance to enter the rift. Once inside, Raleigh
and Mako will detonate Gipsy's nuclear reactor

00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:10.610
and destroy the rift. Gipsy attaches itself
to the Category 5 Kaiju and fall with it into

00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:16.800
the rift, bypassing the code that would reject
any non-kaiju. Inside the Kaiju dimension,

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:21.730
Raleigh ejects Mako in a life pod and manually
initiates the detonation of the nuclear core.

00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:27.160
As Gypsy Danger enters the other dimension,
Raleigh ejects in his own pod before Gipsy

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:34.350
Danger explodes and collapses the rift, ending
the Kaiju threat once and for all. On the

00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:39.850
surface of the Pacific Ocean, both pods reach
the surface. For a brief period, it seems

00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:44.810
that Raleigh may be dead but he awakens, much
to Mako's joy.

00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:50.760
A mid-credits scene reveals that Hannibal
Chau has survived being swallowed by the baby

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:56.070
Kaiju by cutting his way out with a pocket
knife. He angrily asks where the shoe he lost

00:13:56.070 --> 00:13:58.630
is.

00:13:58.630 --> 00:14:01.920
