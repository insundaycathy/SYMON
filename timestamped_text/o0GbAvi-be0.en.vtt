00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.240
Hey, welcome back to scary recap.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.960
Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar&nbsp;
Children is surely a peculiar movie.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.160
Though the film might remind you of 'x-men,' it&nbsp;
also has its unique set of twists and enthralling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:30.080
plots. Without wasting any more time, let's dive&nbsp;
right into it. Watch out for the spoilers ahead!

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.720
The story goes something like thisâ€¦..
2:55 to 3:46:&nbsp;

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.640
Jacob Portman is a very silent&nbsp;
kid who lived with his parents.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.280
The movie features a beach in Florida while&nbsp;
Jacob narrates how nothing he does matters&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.000
and how it's so much similar to the footprints&nbsp;
on the sand being washed away by the sea waves.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:51.520
Jacob is seen working in a department store while&nbsp;
a bunch of teens come in and mess around with him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.280
He identified one of the girls as his schoolmate&nbsp;
and tried to talk to her. But one of the insolent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.840
boys from the group threw a pack of adult&nbsp;
diapers aiming at the stacked-up diaper packets,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:07.040
causing everything to fall. This made Jacob&nbsp;
clean up the whole mess done by the teens.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:12.000
When Jacob was about to pick up the packages, he&nbsp;
was approached by the story lady, saying that he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.680
had a call to answer. This scene alone tells a lot&nbsp;
about Jacob or Jake, who doesn't have friends and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.280
is more of a silent and vulnerable type of person.
3:50 to 8:40:&nbsp;

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.800
The store lady named Shelly offered to give Jake&nbsp;
a ride home to his grandpas. As Jake's dad was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:32.640
busy with work, Jake was pressured to visit his&nbsp;
grandpa. On the ride home, Jake called his grandpa&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.400
to see if he was doing fine. Abe, his grandpa,&nbsp;
responded to the call in a somewhat concerned and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.320
frightened way and warned Jake not to visit home.&nbsp;
From the grandpa's behaviors and overall body&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.920
language, one could say that Abe was delusional&nbsp;
and was suffering from Alzheimer's or dementia.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.040
But was it the truth? Abe told Jake not to see&nbsp;
him and mentioned something about a key to his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:00.560
gun cabinet. Jake ignored the call and drove up&nbsp;
to Abe's house. While driving through the foggy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:06.400
dark neighborhood, both Shelly and Jake saw&nbsp;
a strange man with odd eyes; Jake especially&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:12.000
found it pretty bizarre. Upon Jake reaching Abe's&nbsp;
house, he found out that his grandpa's house could&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.040
possibly be robbed since the inside was a mess&nbsp;
and a few doors were broken down from the outside.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.320
Jake rushed to check on his grandpa only to see&nbsp;
him lying on the ground surrounded by spooky&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:27.920
trees. With the last breath he had, Abe muttered&nbsp;
to his grandson to run away from the place.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:36.160
He added, "go to the island, find Emerson. The&nbsp;
postcard, go to the loop, September 3rd, 1943".&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.200
Confused about this statement, Jake asked what it&nbsp;
meant, but his heart stopped beating before Abe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:47.120
could answer it. Jake then hears a creepy thumping&nbsp;
sound and sees a giant monster with no eyes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.160
a ferocious set of teeth, and sharp claws.&nbsp;
When the monster was about to catch Jake,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:57.120
she interrupted them with her gun and shot the&nbsp;
trees where the monster was standing because Jake&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.080
was the only one who could see the monster.
8:45 to 15:30:&nbsp;

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:05.520
That incident explained the next scene, which is&nbsp;
Jacob having a conversation with his therapist.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:10.880
He asks why he keeps on seeing monsters and is&nbsp;
struggling with nightmares and anxiety. Jake&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.800
told her about Abe's stories in his childhood,&nbsp;
which might have had something to do with his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:20.240
nightmares. He also mentioned that, according to&nbsp;
the cops and doctors, his grandpa died of a heart&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:25.200
attack that night, which didn't make sense since&nbsp;
his grandpa's eyes were gone when Jake discovered&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.240
him. Jakes's childhood was spent mostly with his&nbsp;
grandpa while his parents were away for work.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.920
Both had a special bond because grandpa shared his&nbsp;
exciting stories with Jake, and when Jake grew up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:41.120
constantly hearing these stories, he actually&nbsp;
believed it. Not only did grandpa tell him the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:47.200
strange tales, he even showed him a few precious&nbsp;
pictures relating to the stories. In Abe's story,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.080
he lived in a special children's house with the&nbsp;
headmistress as Miss Peregrine who could turn into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:57.680
a bird. Among the special children, there were&nbsp;
Bronwyn and Victor, who were as strong as ten men.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:03.440
Hugh was a boy with bees living inside him, while&nbsp;
Emma was a girl who was lighter than the air.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:09.040
Abe was a native of Poland. Jake was called&nbsp;
"tygrysku" by his grandfather, which meant "little&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:14.400
tiger" in Polish. Jake got made fun of a lot as a&nbsp;
kid when he explained his grandpa's tales to his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.160
classmates, which was why he had no friends.
15:35 to 36:00:&nbsp;

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:23.040
On Jake's birthday after his grandpa's death,&nbsp;
he received a present that Abe meant to give&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:27.840
him. It was a book with a postcard inside of&nbsp;
it. The back of the postcard had something&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.920
written on it, and Jake assumed that the&nbsp;
sentence was written by Miss Peregrine,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:37.120
the headmistress of the special children's house&nbsp;
Abe used to stay at. The postcard concerned&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:43.360
Jake a lot. During his therapy the next day, dr&nbsp;
Golan suggested that Jake visit Miss Peregrine,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:48.400
who could still be alive, and confront his fears&nbsp;
by visiting Wales, where the children's home was.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:54.320
Jake and his dad set off on a journey to Wales,&nbsp;
and somehow Jake stumbles upon this abandoned,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:58.240
shattered mansion which the natives&nbsp;
described as the 'special children's home.'&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:03.920
This was surprising because this wasn't what&nbsp;
Jake expected to see. Jake reached the hotel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:08.640
where he and his dad were staying. He picked up&nbsp;
a conversation with an old guy in a wheelchair&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:13.680
who was yet to be introduced. The old guy filled&nbsp;
in the information that everyone at the children's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:18.960
home had passed away due to a German bomb attack.&nbsp;
The next day, Jake crashes at the abandoned&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:24.880
mansion and explores the whole abode. As Jake&nbsp;
covered most of the filthy ancient mansion, he saw&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:30.640
a girl standing in the corridor. To his surprise,&nbsp;
she called him "Abe," but before she could talk,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:36.400
Jake fled the place. And during his escape, he&nbsp;
encountered more children. After stumbling upon&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:41.520
a rock, Jake was carried by Bronwyn to a cave&nbsp;
where the other children were waiting. When&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:47.040
Jake opened his eyes, he saw the children who his&nbsp;
grandpa described. Still, it was hard to believe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:52.240
that they were standing right in front of his eyes&nbsp;
when he knew that they all died in a bomb attack.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:57.760
Through a narrow path of the cave, Jake escaped&nbsp;
and ran to the hotel where his dad was staying.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:03.840
The manager of the hotel couldn't recognize Jake's&nbsp;
face and told him to get out. At the same time,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:09.120
the hotel customers started suspecting Jake of&nbsp;
being an American spy who landed here for no good.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:14.400
Just when Jake was about to get hit, Millard,&nbsp;
the special kid with invisible powers,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:19.200
started throwing the beer glasses, while Olive,&nbsp;
who had the quirks to set a place on fire,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:23.360
lit the hotel up and fled the area&nbsp;
with Jake. The children took Jake&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.440
back to the children's home, where they were&nbsp;
welcomed by Miss Peregrine smoking her pipe.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:32.960
Miss Peregrine introduced the children to Jake,&nbsp;
while Jake observed all the peculiar powers of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:38.560
the children. Miss Peregrine also explained why&nbsp;
other people saw peculiar children as a threat,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:42.000
and the mansion was a blessing to protect them.
37:00 to 1:01:35:&nbsp;

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.840
Most importantly, she mentioned how&nbsp;
she had the power to control time,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:51.440
so the 'loop' could be relived every day. Jake&nbsp;
also meets Enoch, who could bring toys to life by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:56.960
placing a heart inside. During dinner, Enoch was&nbsp;
the one who caused a fight with Emma because of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:02.560
his suspicious and rude behavior. Miss Peregrine&nbsp;
quickly takes the children outside when the bomb&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:08.160
attack happens to rewind time. After this, Jake&nbsp;
finds his way to the hotel in the present, where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:13.440
his dad was searching for him. Jake finds some&nbsp;
bad news relating to the loop at the hotel and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:18.880
hurries to miss peregrine to inform her the next&nbsp;
day. Though Miss Peregrine was furious about Jake&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:24.720
telling her the news, this was necessary. Jake&nbsp;
is then made to visit a dead victor while Enoch&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:28.000
played a little trick on Jake and terrified him.
1:02:00 to 1:08:00&nbsp;

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.360
After a while, when the children&nbsp;
and Miss Peregrine went for a walk,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:35.600
Emma dragged Jake to the middle of the sea&nbsp;
and swam below it to reach a sunken ship.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:41.680
Emma tells Jake about the 'bad peculiars' who&nbsp;
Barron led. Emma also feeds Jake with the ultimate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:45.360
truth that he was also gifted and peculiar.
1:08:00 to 1:14:00&nbsp;

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:50.000
When disagreed with this, Emma takes Jake to the&nbsp;
place where Miss Peregrine would kill a hollow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.360
every day, according to the loop time. Hollow is&nbsp;
the name given for the monsters who killed Abe.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:55.920 --> 00:08:01.280
In reality, Jake was the only one who could see a&nbsp;
hollow, and that was one of the most significant&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:07.280
powers ever. Miss Peregrine explains to Jake about&nbsp;
the bad organization that hunts for peculiar kids.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.200
They are hideously Crazy scientists who murdered&nbsp;
a 'Ymbryne,' which are female peculiars capable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:18.800
of turning into birds. The torturing of a Ymbryne&nbsp;
was however a massive failed experiment to capture&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:24.160
their potential to gain immortality. Mr. Barron&nbsp;
could shift his appearance, and what gave them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:28.880
more power to strengthen their abilities were&nbsp;
the peculiar eyeballs. When the hollows ate the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:33.840
eyeballs, they could visibly recover their human&nbsp;
form, even though they would get milky white eyes.&nbsp;

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:37.840
1:15:00 to 1:20:19:
In January 2016, an injured Ymbryne,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:43.600
Miss Avocet, was discovered by Emma. She said that&nbsp;
Barron tortured her at Blackpool, England, killed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:49.200
her children, and tried to recreate a terrible&nbsp;
experiment with more Ymbrynes. Jake reminded Miss&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:54.080
Peregrine that a 'hollow' might be on the loose&nbsp;
since he and his dad discovered a flock of sheeps&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:59.840
dead. This news petrified Miss Peregrine, and she&nbsp;
prepared to go with her children and Miss Avocet.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:05.840
Meanwhile, Jake came back in 2016, but when&nbsp;
he finds an older man dead by the Hollow,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:11.360
he goes back to the cave portal to warn them that&nbsp;
the Hollow is near. On his way to the cave, Jake&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:16.560
was followed by another visitor on the island,&nbsp;
an environmentalist who was actually Mr. Barron,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:20.400
the leader of the hollows, the crazy scientist.
1:21:14 to 1:31:00&nbsp;

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:25.280
Barron had been trying to remove Ms. Peregrine's&nbsp;
time loop from his grandpa, but the hungry Hollow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:31.120
murdered Abe before he could. He then disguised&nbsp;
as Dr. Golan with his human shifting abilities,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:36.480
asking Jake to visit the island so that Barron&nbsp;
could access the loop. Barron then threatened and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:42.000
forced Miss Peregrine to Blackpool, leaving Jake,&nbsp;
the other kids, and Miss Avocet as the substitute&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:47.600
for the Hollow on the loose to prey on. Malthus,&nbsp;
the Hollow on the loose, was coming to execute&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:53.040
Miss Avocet, but Jake and the children tried to&nbsp;
escape. While Malthus was close to attacking the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:58.080
children, he got dropped over a bomb because it&nbsp;
was exactly the time when the German fleet came&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:03.520
and destroyed the house by dropping bombs. Now&nbsp;
with Miss Peregrine gone, the time loop was closed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:07.520
forever, leaving it locked in 1943.
1:36:00 to 1:53:00&nbsp;

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:12.880
Jake and the children traveled to Blackpool on&nbsp;
the sunken ship and entered its January 2016&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:18.240
loop. It was an attempt to fight against Barron&nbsp;
and the Hollow allies and free Miss Peregrine&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:23.760
and the other captive Ymbrynes. After taking care&nbsp;
of most of the hollows with the children's help,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:28.320
Jake goes to find Barron to finish him&nbsp;
off. Barron then disguises himself as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:33.920
Jake in the hope that Emma and Enoch will become&nbsp;
confused. But Jake could notice the hollows. To&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:38.560
prove that he was the real Jake, he points&nbsp;
Emma and Enoch to the last remaining Hollow,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:44.080
who attempted to kill them from the back. Since&nbsp;
Barron turned himself into a fake Jake, he could&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:48.960
not spot the Hollow from the back, and right at&nbsp;
this moment, the Hollow killed Barron and Jake&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:52.560
used this opportunity to slay the last Hollow.
1:54:00&nbsp;

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:57.200
Before closing the time loop, Jake said&nbsp;
goodbye to Emma and the children as they left&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:04.640
and returned to the ship in 1943. Jake, on the&nbsp;
other hand, stayed in 2016 and visited Florida.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:10.000
He went straight to his grandfather Abe, who&nbsp;
was alive since fate changed. Jake explained the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.600
tales in Wales and the adventures he experienced&nbsp;
to Abe. Abe then offers Jake an international&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:22.160
time map that allowed him to go back to 1943 to&nbsp;
meet his pals and, most importantly, Emma. After&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:27.440
going back to his dear friends and Emma, they&nbsp;
tell each other their sentiments and kiss. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:32.160
movie ends with the youngsters and Miss Peregrine&nbsp;
having their happy time loop on their own ship.&nbsp;

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:37.840
