00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.440
A babysitter tucks in a small&nbsp;
boy inside of a cozy house.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.640
She then heads into the kitchen, where she finds&nbsp;
that flour has been spilled all over the floor.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:12.080
Upon sweeping it up, she hears a&nbsp;
noise coming from behind a plant.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.800
She walks over to investigate, but turns around&nbsp;
abruptly when she feels a presence behind her. She&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.120
is then struck on the head with the toy hammer,&nbsp;
causing her to fall backwards through a window.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:26.800
What is her fate after this ordeal? Who&nbsp;
is this intruder? This is Movie Shortens.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:32.400
Follow us to find the answer in a movie titled:&nbsp;
Child’s Play. Be aware, there are spoilers!
&nbsp;

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.440
In the opening scene of the movie, we find&nbsp;
ourselves on the dark, dank streets of Chicago’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.720
south side. Detective Mike Norris is on the trail&nbsp;
of a serial killer Charles Lee Ray, who he calls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.520
The Strangler. The two of them soon engage in a&nbsp;
gunfight as Norris strikes his target in the leg.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.240
Lee Ray tries to make a break for it, then&nbsp;
we hear the wailing sirens of a police car.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:56.640
This causes Charles’s getaway driver, Eddie&nbsp;
Caputo, to flee, leaving his partner at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.600
mercy of the police. The police car doesn’t&nbsp;
stop, and Norris continues his pursuit. 
&nbsp;

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.560
Having taken cover in the doorway of a toy store,&nbsp;
Charles shoots at the lock making his way inside.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.440
Norris follows him cautiously, careful not to&nbsp;
break his cover. Inside the store more shots are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.160
fired and the police officer fatally wounds his&nbsp;
target. Aware that he is about to die, Charles&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:22.080
begins speaking in tongues. He grabs a nearby Good&nbsp;
Guy doll aiming to transfer his life into the toy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.160
Continuing a Haitian chant, the sky&nbsp;
breaks out into a thunderous storm.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.640
Then a huge bolt of lighting smashes through&nbsp;
the roof of the shop. It creates an explosion&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.280
that devastates the building, sending the cop&nbsp;
flying across the room. Picking himself up,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.120
he stumbles over to see the corpse of The&nbsp;
Strangler and the doll lying next to him. 
&nbsp;

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.840
In the next scene, we observe 6 year old&nbsp;
Andy, making a messy breakfast for his mother,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.960
Karen Barclay. As he prepares breakfast, the TV is&nbsp;
on in the background. While he is waiting for the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.920
toast, Andy catches sight of an advertisement&nbsp;
for a Good Guy doll and is enamored by it. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.880
then continues finishing the meal carrying it on&nbsp;
a tray to his mother’s bedside. As she awakens, we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.680
learn that it is Andy’s birthday. She celebrates&nbsp;
the occasion by giving him hugs and kisses. 
&nbsp;

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.760
Soon Andy begins to unwrap his gifts. The first&nbsp;
he opens is the biggest box, but is disappointed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:15.360
to find ill-fitting clothes inside. Next he opens&nbsp;
a smaller package containing a set of toy tools,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.600
including a saw and a hammer. He then&nbsp;
begs his mother for a Good Guy doll and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.680
she seems to give in to his desire. 
Later in the day, Karen is at work in a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.760
department store. She begins talking to her&nbsp;
best friend Maggie about the good guy doll&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.320
that Andy is asking for. Even though they should&nbsp;
stay at work, Maggie persuades Karen to go and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.920
make the purchase from the peddler. 
Outside, the two ladies haggle with the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:41.360
homeless man selling toys. He initially asks&nbsp;
for 50 bucks, but they negotiate for 30,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.440
Maggie feels slighted with the price.&nbsp;
She then asks if the doll is stolen,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.320
but the unfriendly man responds with aggression.&nbsp;
They then walk away with their new purchase.
&nbsp;

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.160
Upon returning to the store, Karen’s&nbsp;
boss is sitting there waiting.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.160
He is angry that she left her position as&nbsp;
it wasn’t her break time. He then forces&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:03.040
her into covering a shift later that evening,&nbsp;
threatening her with being fired if she refuses.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.360
Karen is reluctant, because it is her son’s&nbsp;
birthday, but Maggie then offers to babysit. 
&nbsp;

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.960
During a break between her shifts, Karen&nbsp;
returns home with the doll giving it to Andy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:17.360
He is delighted with the present and begins to&nbsp;
play with it. He introduces himself to the doll&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.640
and it responds. The doll’s name is Chucky. The&nbsp;
two continue to play late into the evening under&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:28.400
Maggie's watchful eye. Chucky, seems distracted&nbsp;
by the 9 o’clock news, which Andy takes notice of.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.200
As Andy is told to get ready for bed, he tells&nbsp;
Maggie that Chucky wants to watch the news.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.840
She turns the TV off taking the two of them&nbsp;
to Andy’s room. As Andy is brushing his teeth,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.560
Maggie suddenly hears the TV has been turned&nbsp;
back on. She enters the living room finding&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.840
Chucky seated watching the news. She returns&nbsp;
Chucky to Andy’s room and scolds Andy for not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:53.760
listening to her. Andy denies any wrongdoing. 
With Andy tucked in bed, Maggie continues tidying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.560
up around the apartment. She soon becomes&nbsp;
disconcerted by strange noises she hears around&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.840
the house. When Karen calls asking about their&nbsp;
evening, Maggie expresses her concerns over the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.800
noises she’s been hearing. When she returns to the&nbsp;
kitchen, she finds that flour has been poured onto&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:14.240
the floor. As she begins sweeping up the flour,&nbsp;
she hears a noise behind a plant. She steps over&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:19.120
to investigate, but turns around abruptly when she&nbsp;
feels a presence behind her. She is struck on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:24.240
forehead with a toy hammer, causing her to fall&nbsp;
backwards through a window. Maggie plummets to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:29.200
her death coming to a rest on a vehicle below. 
When Karen gets home, she sees that her building&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.680
has been cordoned off and emergency response&nbsp;
teams are on the scene. She pushes through the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:39.200
cordon and rushes to her apartment. She enters in&nbsp;
a panic, looking everywhere for Andy. Fortunately&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:43.840
she finds that he is safe, but she quickly learns&nbsp;
about Maggie’s fate. Detective Norris and his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.960
partner Jack interview the two of them. Norris&nbsp;
quickly suspects Andy of involvement as the shoes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.720
he is wearing match those of the footprints&nbsp;
found at the scene. As they are leaving,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:58.160
Andy notices flour on the soles of Chucky’s shoes&nbsp;
which are the same as his. Andy runs out telling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:02.240
his mother as well as the detectives that “Chucky&nbsp;
did it”, but they don’t believe him one ounce. 
&nbsp;

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:07.200
Back in Andy’s room, Andy tells his mom that&nbsp;
Chucky has been talking to him. Chucky has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:12.000
told him that his real name is Charles Lee Ray&nbsp;
and that Maggie deserved what happened to her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.280
Karen is shocked by this and is clearly upset with&nbsp;
this story. Realizing his mother isn’t having it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:21.280
Andy apologizes telling her that he&nbsp;
won’t make up any further stories.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:25.760
Karen invites Andy to sleep with her, but he&nbsp;
declines, telling her that he has Chucky. 
&nbsp;

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:31.920
The next morning, Karen drops Andy at school&nbsp;
who is continuously clutching onto Chucky.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:37.600
As she departs, Andy exits the school building. He&nbsp;
then heads for the metro station catching a train.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:41.120
As the train moves along, Chucky is&nbsp;
whispering something to Andy. 
&nbsp;

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:45.920
The two of them get off in a rundown part of town&nbsp;
and begin walking towards a derelict building.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:51.520
Andy stops to pee near some rubbish placing Chucky&nbsp;
on a rocking chair. While Andy’s back is turned,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:56.080
Chucky makes a run for it. He enters the kitchen&nbsp;
of a house, where he then turns on the gas.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:01.760
Upstairs Eddie Caputo is awakened by a noise&nbsp;
and goes downstairs to investigate. As he does,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:07.200
he sees Andy walk past calling for Chucky. Clearly&nbsp;
feeling threatened, Eddie begins firing his gun&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:12.640
to scare off the intruder. He does so again in&nbsp;
the kitchen, but this causes the gas to explode.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:18.080
The house then blows up and collapses with Eddie&nbsp;
still inside. Chucky has killed once again.
&nbsp;

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:22.880
Believing Andy is responsible, the police take him&nbsp;
to the station to interrogate him. The interview&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:28.080
is observed by Dr. Ardmore. He quickly asserts&nbsp;
that Andy is suffering from some form of mental&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:33.840
issue. He exclaims that Andy be admitted to&nbsp;
a psychiatric hospital for observation. 
&nbsp;

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:38.800
Back at home, Karen picks up the Good Guy&nbsp;
doll case as a pair of batteries fall out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:43.520
Concerned by this discovery, she picks up Chucky&nbsp;
opening his back then discovers that he has been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:49.520
moving and responding without a source of power.&nbsp;
Chucky reacts to this breaking her clasp on him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:54.640
He then begins to verbally attack her. During the&nbsp;
altercation he bites her arm, leaving a clear,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:54.640 --> 00:07:00.080
open wound. She flees in a taxi to find Mike&nbsp;
Norris, but he is dismissive of her story.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:04.160
She then decides to go and confront the&nbsp;
peddler, against the policeman's advice.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:07.440
The pedlar refuses to talk to&nbsp;
her and insteads assaults her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:11.440
Norris - who has followed her - interjects.&nbsp;
During the conversation that follows,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:16.640
he tells Karen a story about the toy shop and how&nbsp;
he had killed Charles Lee Ray inside of it.
&nbsp;

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:19.520
The detective’s first encounter&nbsp;
with Chucky occurs in his car,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:24.480
after dropping Karen off at home. Chucky appears&nbsp;
out of nowhere and attempts to strangle Norris.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:29.280
Norris is able to free himself, using the car’s&nbsp;
cigarette lighter to burn Chucky on his temple.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:33.680
Unscathed, Chucky then attempts stabbing Norris&nbsp;
through his seat but is again unsuccessful.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:39.200
Finally, Chucky climbs into the footwell pushing&nbsp;
the accelerator causing the vehicle to crash.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:43.600
Trapped in his flipped car, Norris now&nbsp;
seems at the mercy of the doll. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:48.880
he draws his weapon and is able to keep Chucky at&nbsp;
bay. He also manages to shoot and wound him. 
&nbsp;

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:55.520
Chucky, realizing that he can indeed be injured,&nbsp;
confronts a voodoo master, Dr. John Bishop.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:55.520 --> 00:08:00.080
We then learn that Charles Lee Ray had also&nbsp;
learned how to use black magic from the bishop.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:05.520
Using a voodoo doll, he breaks Bishop’s leg and&nbsp;
his arm, leaving him writhing in agony. Though&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:11.440
initially reluctant to help, the pain leads Bishop&nbsp;
to reveal that Lee Ray can become a human. He can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:16.400
only do this if he occupies the body of the person&nbsp;
in which he first revealed himself to. Chucky&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:21.440
kills Bishop and heads off in search of Andy. 
From his cell, Andy sees Chucky climbing some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:26.160
steps outside. He yells for the doctor’s&nbsp;
assistance begging him for help. His cries&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:31.920
go unheard. Chucky steals the keys and enters the&nbsp;
cell. Andy then manages to escape trying to hide&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:37.440
in an operation room but Chucky finds him. Hearing&nbsp;
a disturbance, the doctor goes to investigate.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:42.000
He is stabbed in the leg by Chucky and then&nbsp;
electrocuted, becoming chucky’s next victim. 
&nbsp;

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.440
Knowing that he will be suspected&nbsp;
of the killing, Andy escapes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:50.480
He returns home and tries to barricade himself&nbsp;
inside. Chucky is then able to get in using the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:55.760
chimney. Armed with a knife, the doll begins&nbsp;
to hunt Andy down, quickly overpowering him. 
&nbsp;

00:08:55.760 --> 00:09:00.720
He begins performing another voodoo ritual, to&nbsp;
take over Andy’s body, but Mike and Karen arrive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:05.600
in the nick of time. They manage to intervene,&nbsp;
when Norris is stabbed in the leg. A battle&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:10.560
ensues around the apartment, and luckily Karen&nbsp;
is able to protect Andy from any assault. 
&nbsp;

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:15.680
Eventually she manages to trap Chucky in the&nbsp;
fireplace. Andy helps her to set him alight,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:20.960
telling Chucky that “playtime is over”. Chucky,&nbsp;
covered in flames, stumbles out and collapses in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:26.080
a heap of burnt ashes. The mother and son hug&nbsp;
one another then tend to Norris’s injuries.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:32.240
Chucky, however, is not yet done. He springs back&nbsp;
to life, tracking them while carrying his knife.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:37.200
Karen manages to shoot him, taking off his&nbsp;
head, arm and leg, incapacitating the doll. 
&nbsp;

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:42.560
At this point, Jack arrives refusing to&nbsp;
believe that a toy could have done this.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:47.120
Against Norris’s advice, he picks up Chucky’s&nbsp;
head and begins playing with it. As he does so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:51.920
he is grabbed by Chucky’s one remaining arm.&nbsp;
At this time, Norris is able to shoot Chucky&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:56.880
through the heart. This is the only way that&nbsp;
he could be killed according to Dr. Bishop.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:01.520
With Chucky’s blood splattered across the&nbsp;
wall, the others rush Norris to the hospital.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:05.040
As they are leaving, Jack jokingly mentions&nbsp;
that no one is going to believe him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:10.240
Andy, meanwhile, peers suspiciously through a&nbsp;
doorway at the remains of his good guy buddy.
