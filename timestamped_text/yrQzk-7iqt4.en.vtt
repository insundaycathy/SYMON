00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.110
Hi, Mystery Recapped here.

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:07.379
Today, I'm going to explain the American drama
thriller film called “Before I Wake.”

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:08.540
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:09.979
Watch out and take care!

00:00:14.375 --> 00:00:18.150
It is midnight when a grown man slowly enters
a little kid’s room.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.400
He points a gun at the sleeping child.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.859
He seems to be nervous and apologizes to him,
calling him Cody.

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:27.823
A sudden commotion makes him pull the trigger;
the gunfire awakens Cody.

00:00:27.823 --> 00:00:31.183
The man breaks down in tears and apologizes
to him.

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:35.044
Cut to a few months later, a couple named
Jessie and Mark Hobson have been approved

00:00:35.044 --> 00:00:36.704
as foster parents.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.140
They sit across Natalie, a worker at the foster
care.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.790
She tells them about an eight-year-old boy
named Cody.

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.120
Cody’s father was never around, and his
mother died when he was only three.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.900
Cody has not had many good experiences in
the foster care system.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.830
His former foster parents had abandoned him,
leaving him to live alone for about a month

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:56.630
before he was rescued.

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.770
He has sleep issues, but he is resilient and
smart.

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.390
Natalie thinks he would be perfect for the
Hobsons to foster.

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.700
Having found the perfect kid for them, the
Hobsons return home happily that day.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.490
Their young son, Sean, had died by accidentally
drowning in a bathtub.

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.950
This had a huge impact on the couple, but
now they are ready to welcome a new member

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.380
to their family.

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.950
At home, they redecorate the house to make
it fit for Cody.

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.409
Mark takes down every picture of Sean from
the walls and only leaves their family picture.

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.890
He also sets an extra handle on the wall beside
the bathtub.

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.650
Later that day, Jessie tells her self-help
group about their decision to foster Cody.

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.370
Everyone there is happy for her.

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:38.600
Jessie has had trouble sleeping since Sean’s
death.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.030
The next day, the couple impatiently waits
for Cody to arrive.

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.820
Natalie’s car parks in their driveway and
they rush to see Cody.

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.860
He wishes the couple a good morning.

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.510
He brings with him a box....that Mark helps
him carry inside.

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:56.127
As Cody is looking around the house, the family
picture with Sean...seems to have caught his eyes

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:00.400
He stares at it, as Mark tells him about his
collection of games.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.330
The adults then take him to his new room which
he loves.

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.909
Especially the curtains with butterflies on
them.

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.800
Natalie tells them that Cody likes to collect
butterflies as a hobby.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.610
Later that night, the couple tuck Cody to
bed.

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.880
But after they leave, Cody sits up and opens
the box that he brought with him.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.880
Inside is a can of soda and a book about butterflies.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.650
He sips on the soda and starts reading the
book under the blanket using a torchlight.

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.090
He doesn’t sleep at all.

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.680
The following day is his first day at school.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.030
That day at school, Cody meets Annie and befriends
her.

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.209
Jessie is folding Cody’s laundry that day
when she finds his secret box.

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:41.560
Inside is his book about butterflies, several
cans of soda, and a bottle of stimulants.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.599
When she tucks him to bed at night, she asks
him about the box.

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:49.239
According to him, the stimulants and cans
of soda are to help him not fall asleep.

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:52.569
He adds that when he falls asleep, the “canker”
man comes.

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:56.120
Thinking that the child just has nightmares,
Jessie dismisses it.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.900
She tells him that the man will go away with
little reasoning.

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.590
However, Cody believes that the Canker man
ate his mother, and is always with him.

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.709
Jessie puts him to bed and goes to Mark in
their living room.

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:09.399
She feels sorry for going through Cody’s
box.

00:03:09.399 --> 00:03:13.756
She feels like she has invaded his privacy,
but Mark assures her it is for his own good.

00:03:14.417 --> 00:03:17.338
Some time later, they are watching a movie
together.

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.810
Then all of a sudden, several butterflies
fly into the room.

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.430
They look holographic.

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.760
The couple is beyond surprised to see this
many at once.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.740
Mark captures one in a jar for Cody, while
Jessie closes the windows.

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:33.020
As the windows close, all of the butterflies
disappear.

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:35.000
The couple is left stunned.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.910
Jessie has a hard time falling asleep that
night.

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.900
She goes down to the kitchen where she hears
an odd noise.

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.300
She looks around to see if there is an intruder.

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.370
Suddenly, Sean appears in the dark living
room.

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.010
Jessie is in shock; a glass falls from her
hand and breaks.

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.550
When she looks up again, Sean is gone.

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:56.260
She goes to Cody’s room to check on him;
he sleeps peacefully.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.760
Cut to the next day, Jessie is back with the
self-help group.

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.879
She tells them about seeing Sean.

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:05.750
According to her, Sean seems angry to be replaced
by Cody.

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:10.430
Later that day, Mark notices Cody staring
at their family picture with Sean in it.

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.519
He talks to the couple about Sean.

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:14.560
They lovingly answer all Cody’s questions.

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.519
At night, the butterflies appear again.

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.880
They look around when suddenly, Sean appears
in the room.

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.710
He is wearing the same clothes as their family
picture.

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.690
The couple is beyond surprised.

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:27.660
They walk up to him to touch him.

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.630
When they do, they realize that he is actually
real.

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:32.720
But Sean suddenly disappears.

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.270
At the same time, we see Cody wake up.

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:38.199
He comes down and apologizes to the couple.

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:40.560
The breakfast the following day is awkward.

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.230
Jessie and Mark do not know what to say; they
are still in shock.

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:47.430
But they believe that Sean’s appearance
has something to do with Cody.

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:50.020
Cody apologizes to them for something.

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:55.020
Later, when Cody is back from school, the
family watches videos of Sean.

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:59.160
It is a Christmas video and all three of them
look very happy in it.

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:03.350
That night after Cody falls asleep, Mark and
Jessie stay in the living room.

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:08.300
Suddenly, the room lights up with Christmas
lights, and a Christmas tree appears too.

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.630
Just then, Sean appears wearing the clothes
he did in the video.

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:13.660
The video has come to life.

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:15.800
Mark and Jessie are left speechless.

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.650
They finally realize that Cody is blessed
with supernatural power.

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:21.990
All of his dreams come to life while he sleeps.

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:25.530
However, when he wakes up, the dream vanishes.

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:29.820
Cut to the next day, Cody draws a figure of
a man and proceeds to scribble over it.

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.360
He tells Annie that it is the Canker man.

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.950
Sometimes when Cody scribbles over him, it
keeps the man away.

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:39.180
Jessie puts the pictures of Sean back for
Cody to see.

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.190
She wants to meet her dead son again.

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:44.070
However, Mark is not fond of the idea.

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:47.540
He accuses Jessie of using Cody to fulfill
her desires.

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:51.190
But Jessie insists that Cody is the only one
who can help them heal.

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:54.320
Irritated, Mark puts the photo frames away.

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:58.150
The next day, Cody brings a butterfly trapped
in a jar to school.

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:00.530
But his bully, Tate, breaks it.

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:04.630
Cody has been staying up all night in fear
of the Canker man, so he almost falls asleep

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:05.820
in the class.

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:09.600
During the lunch break, he gets permission
to rest in the class for a while.

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.680
He is alone there when he falls asleep.

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:13.760
Cody dreams of the canker man.

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:15.880
Cody's blessing is also a curse.

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:19.110
Along with his dreams, his nightmares are
real too.

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:23.470
As Cody sleeps, his bully enters the classroom
and faces the Canker man.

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:26.660
Annie sees the canker man indulge Tate and
yells in fear.

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:29.280
Cody wakes up, but Tate has disappeared.

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:32.780
The police arrive at the school to investigate
the disappearance.

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:37.180
Cody cannot risk sleeping now, so he takes
coffee to avoid sleeping.

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:41.150
That night, Cody reads the book about butterflies
like he usually does.

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:45.949
Suddenly, he hears a noise; he checks under
the bed when suddenly, Tate’s ghost appears

00:06:45.949 --> 00:06:48.360
in front of him and drags him under the bed.

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:51.350
Cody tries to fight and screams “I am awake.”

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:55.490
Meanwhile, Sean appears before Jessie; he
too is saying, “I am awake.”

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:58.460
Cody yells loudly which makes the dreams go
away.

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:03.169
Jessie rushes to him, asks him what is wrong,
and tries to calm him down.

00:07:03.169 --> 00:07:06.940
The following day, Jessie talks to a doctor
about Cody’s insomnia.

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:11.350
Meanwhile, Cody and Mark go shopping and buy
stuff for Cody’s room.

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:15.100
When they get back home, two police officers
are in front of their house.

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:18.210
They want to interview Cody about Tate’s
disappearance.

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:23.042
Later that day, Cody asks the couple about
Sean’s death, but the couple dismisses the questions.

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:27.630
Jessie mixes the prescribed sleeping pills
with Cody’s milk, unbeknownst to her husband...

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:29.650
and he drinks it.

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:33.870
Marks informs Cody that Sean had died from
drowning as he tucks him to bed.

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:36.490
The drug makes Cody sleep peacefully that
night.

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:39.230
Jessie and Mark are in the living room again.

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:43.990
Some time later, Sean appears in front of
them, but he looks evil and vomits water.

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:48.020
Mark rushes up to wake Cody, but he cannot
wake up...because of the drug.

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:50.620
Soon, the dream turns into a nightmare.

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:53.970
A tall creature appears in front of Jessie
in the living room.

00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:56.500
She runs to Cody’s room and locks the door.

00:07:56.500 --> 00:08:00.530
Mark is worried about Cody not waking up;
just then, Jessie confesses to have drugged him.

00:08:01.241 --> 00:08:04.011
She watches in horror as the creature devours
Mark.

00:08:04.126 --> 00:08:06.576
Suddenly, she falls unconscious.

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:10.250
She wakes up in the morning to Cody calling
911.

00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:11.479
Mark is nowhere to be found.

00:08:11.479 --> 00:08:14.350
It is as if he has disappeared into thin air.

00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:17.850
The police arrive at the scene and accuse
Jessie of drugging the kid.

00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:22.250
They believe that Jessie and Mark are abusing
Cody, so they take him away, as Jessie cries

00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:23.889
for them to stop.

00:08:23.889 --> 00:08:28.770
Jessie then goes to Natalie, but she too accuses
her of child abuse and tells her to go away.

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:33.469
However, Jessie notices Cody’s file on her
desk and manages to steal it.

00:08:33.469 --> 00:08:37.139
Through the file, she finds out about a man
named Whelan Young.

00:08:37.139 --> 00:08:40.357
He is the father of the second family Cody
was fostered by.

00:08:40.357 --> 00:08:41.946
She goes to see him.

00:08:42.139 --> 00:08:46.089
Young tells her that he and his wife fostered
Cody for fifteen months before his dream swallowed

00:08:46.089 --> 00:08:47.649
his wife too.

00:08:47.649 --> 00:08:51.680
He was so angry at Cody that he almost killed
him; this is the scene we saw at the beginning

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:52.949
of the film.

00:08:52.949 --> 00:08:57.868
He then asks her to kill Cody so that no others
can be victims of his nightmares, but Jessie refuses.

00:08:58.529 --> 00:09:03.329
From the file, she also finds Cody’s mother’s
information and her hospital reports.

00:09:03.329 --> 00:09:06.059
She decides to go to the hospital and investigate
further.

00:09:06.059 --> 00:09:08.939
The hospital provides her with her mother’s
belongings.

00:09:08.939 --> 00:09:12.869
It consists of a pillow shaped like a butterfly
and her journal.

00:09:12.869 --> 00:09:17.050
Reading the journal and the reports, Jessie
finds the secret about the Canker man’s existence.

00:09:17.807 --> 00:09:20.836
She then goes to the orphanage Cody is staying
at with the pillow.

00:09:21.079 --> 00:09:25.420
Cody hasn't slept for several nights, so his
caretakers are worried about him.

00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:29.429
Unknown about the Canker man, they give him
a tranquillizer to help him sleep.

00:09:29.429 --> 00:09:31.970
Cody dreams of the man that night as well.

00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:36.180
When Jessie walks into the building, she sees
several nightmares in every room.

00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:41.249
First, she is startled by a flutter of black
moths, then she sees Sean drowning in the bathtub.

00:09:41.748 --> 00:09:45.208
Next, she sees a horrifying-looking woman
twist Cody’s head.

00:09:45.535 --> 00:09:48.176
Lastly, she sees Mark appears in front of
her.

00:09:48.446 --> 00:09:50.603
Scared, she closes the door to that room.

00:09:51.625 --> 00:09:53.629
She finally reaches Cody’s room.

00:09:53.629 --> 00:09:57.350
The Canker man runs towards her to attack
her but instead of running away, she shows

00:09:57.350 --> 00:09:59.079
him the butterfly pillow.

00:09:59.079 --> 00:10:01.249
The Canker man stops when he sees it.

00:10:01.249 --> 00:10:03.350
Jessie slowly hugs the man.

00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:06.970
As she does that, the man turns into Cody
who then disappears.

00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:10.069
Jessie picks a sleeping Cody up and takes
him outside.

00:10:10.069 --> 00:10:13.889
Natalie has been indulged by the Canker man
and comes back to life.

00:10:13.889 --> 00:10:16.649
She sees Jessie take him away, but lets her.

00:10:16.649 --> 00:10:20.040
They see several beautiful butterflies flying
in the hallway.

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:23.049
His nightmare has changed into a magical dream.

00:10:23.049 --> 00:10:26.970
Cut to the next day, Jessie tells Cody that
his mother’s name was Andrea and that she

00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:29.139
died of pancreatic cancer.

00:10:29.139 --> 00:10:32.279
Andrea had found out about Cody’s gift when
he was little.

00:10:32.279 --> 00:10:34.129
She has written it in her journal.

00:10:34.129 --> 00:10:37.980
But when Cody was just three, Andrea was diagnosed
with cancer.

00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:41.769
Cody had seen his mother on the verge of death,
battling cancer.

00:10:41.769 --> 00:10:44.079
She was thin and bald at that time.

00:10:44.079 --> 00:10:47.610
Since he was too young to recognize her as
his mother, his little mind made up that it

00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:49.069
was the canker man.

00:10:49.069 --> 00:10:51.519
He was told that cancer had taken his mother
away.

00:10:51.519 --> 00:10:56.040
With time, he made up the canker man, so he
believed that he took her away.

00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:57.649
This began his nightmares.

00:10:57.649 --> 00:11:01.970
Now that Cody knows that the Canker man is
not real, Jessie believes that his nightmare

00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:03.540
will not come back.

00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:08.170
However, Mark and other people that the Canker
man had taken still haven't come back.

00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:12.249
Jessie believes that as Cody learns to control
his power, there might be a possibility of

00:11:12.249 --> 00:11:13.559
them coming back.

00:11:13.559 --> 00:11:16.860
Cody thanks Jessie for bringing him home and
calls her mom.

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:19.980
He begins to learn how to control his magical
gift.
