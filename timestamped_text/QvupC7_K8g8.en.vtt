00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:06.000
Story Recapped here. Today I'm going to explain&nbsp;
a horror and sci-fi film called "28 Weeks Later."&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.040
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:17.680
In a countryside cottage, husband and wife, Don&nbsp;
and Alice Harris, hide with other survivors. Alice&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.480
still worries about their children, who, just&nbsp;
before the outbreak, went on a school trip abroad.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.680
The couple dines with fellow survivors: Sally,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:33.440
Jacob, Karen, and Geoff. Karen saves a plate&nbsp;
for her boyfriend, Sam, who left the group five&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:39.120
days ago. Jacob argues that Sam is either dead or&nbsp;
doesn't care for them anymore. They're interrupted&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:54.240
by a banging on the door. Hearing a little boy&nbsp;
calling for help, Alice insists on letting him.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.200
While the others are looking after the&nbsp;
boy, Karen peeks outside the house,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:08.400
still hopeful that her boyfriend will return. An&nbsp;
infected appears and grabs her arm, biting her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:14.240
Jacob pulls her away, but Karen tackles him.&nbsp;
Don hits her head with a crowbar to free Jacob.

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.840
The others run away while Don fights the&nbsp;
infected. More infected people break the windows,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.880
getting into the cottage. Alice and&nbsp;
the boy run upstairs for safety. Geoff,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.520
Sally, and Jacob escape to the barn, with Geoff&nbsp;
holding the door to allow the others to escape.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.960
Don kills an infected but loses his&nbsp;
crowbar. He rushes upstairs to find Alice.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.240
Back at the barn, the door breaks,&nbsp;
allowing the infected to overpower Geoff.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.360
Sally freezes in grief for her husband. Jacob&nbsp;
tries to pull her up to the barn's second floor,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.440
but the infected grabs her. Unable to&nbsp;
save her, Jacob shuts the trapdoor.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.240
Don finds Alice in the bedroom, but&nbsp;
she refuses to leave without the boy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.040
She finally sees the boy hiding&nbsp;
in the closet and runs to him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.960
An infected man breaks down the door, coming&nbsp;
between Alice and Don. Alice screams for help,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.800
but the frightened Don shuts the bathroom&nbsp;
door, leaving his wife to fend for herself.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.000
Don climbs out of the window and runs&nbsp;
away. Alice sees him from the window.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.920
But Don continues to run, watching&nbsp;
Alice get overpowered by the infected.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.680
Don sprints to the river with&nbsp;
a horde closing in on him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.640
He reaches the dock where Jacob is preparing&nbsp;
the boat. Don gets in the boat, but Jacob falls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:30.240
in the water. Don tries to pull him up, but&nbsp;
the infected pull him down. Not long after,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.960
Jacob comes back up again, now infected.&nbsp;
Don kicks him off the boat and escapes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.760
His face is full of grief and fear, looking&nbsp;
back to the window where he last saw his wife.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.640
Twenty-eight weeks after the rage virus&nbsp;
hit, an American-led NATO force assists&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.000
Britain's repatriation after all&nbsp;
the infected died from starvation.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.760
A sniper from the US Military, Sergeant Doyle,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.240
keeps watch of the area while joking around&nbsp;
with his friend, a helicopter pilot named Flynn.

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:02.080
A plane arrives at the airport, bringing home&nbsp;
Britons who escaped the outbreak. Major Scarlet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:07.280
Levy, a medical officer, watches the new arrivals&nbsp;
and is upset to see children amongst them.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:13.840
Among the new arrivals are Tammy and Andy.&nbsp;
Scarlet performs Andy's medical evaluation,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.760
noting his heterochromatic eyes,&nbsp;
which he inherited from his mother.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.880
Andy and Tammy are taken to District One, the&nbsp;
first secured quarantine area after the outbreak.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.960
Arriving there, Tammy and Andy happily&nbsp;
reunite with their father, Don.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.840
Meanwhile, Scarlet insists to her superiors&nbsp;
that they are not prepared to admit minors.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.040
General Stone assures her that the virus will not&nbsp;
come back, and if it does, they can control it.

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.800
Back in District One, Don gives his children a&nbsp;
tour. He's a caretaker of the district, providing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:47.120
him a comfortable penthouse for his family. But&nbsp;
they will be moved to a new house in a couple&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.240
of months. Don explains that they can't return to&nbsp;
their old home, given the lack of security in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:58.080
area. This prompts Andy to ask about their mother.&nbsp;
Don hesitantly lies about seeing Alice in a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:02.880
critical state, that he was too late to save her.&nbsp;
Tammy tells him that they're happy he survived.

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.480
That evening, Doyle sets up his sniper rifle&nbsp;
to watch over the residents of District One.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.440
Using his scope, he spies on the building's&nbsp;
residents. When he sees the Harris family, he is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:18.640
glad that their operations help families reunite.&nbsp;
Then, he sees a worried Scarlet in her room.

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.800
Later that evening, Andy has a nightmare, seeing&nbsp;
his infected mother. Andy tells Tammy that he's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.480
worried that he'll forget his mother's&nbsp;
face. Tammy assures him that he wouldn't.

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.680
On the next day, Tammy and Andy sneak out of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.360
safe zone. Doyle spots them and&nbsp;
reports the kids to be retrieved.

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.600
Tammy and Andy run in the streets,&nbsp;
finally getting a taste of freedom.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.360
They stop at a pizza restaurant, seeing&nbsp;
a motorbike. Thinking that they can use&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.200
it to make their trip faster, Tammy goes&nbsp;
in and takes the key from a lifeless body.

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.880
Tammy drives the motorbike until&nbsp;
they finally reach their old home.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.680
They pick up the spare key hidden just as Don&nbsp;
realizes they're missing back in District One.

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.600
The siblings enter their home and&nbsp;
quickly retrieve Alice's photo.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:06.000
Then, Tammy and Andy collect personal&nbsp;
items and clothes from their bedrooms.

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.840
After a while, Andy calls out&nbsp;
for Tammy, but she doesn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:14.400
answer. He hears the door creak in the&nbsp;
attic, and he goes in to investigate.

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:20.800
Inside the attic, he sees bowls of rotting food&nbsp;
and drawings on the wall. A movement catches his&nbsp;

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.680
eye. He gets a closer look&nbsp;
at the figure in the dark.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:29.120
It's Alice. Happy to see his mother, Andy hugs&nbsp;
her. But Alice starts hugging him too tightly.

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:34.240
Soldiers arrive in front of the house. Andy&nbsp;
frees himself and runs out of the house with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:38.400
Tammy following him. The soldiers corner&nbsp;
the children and investigate the house.

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:44.240
In District One, Alice is given a decontamination&nbsp;
bath. She's later strapped to a bed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:50.000
surrounded by soldiers. Scarlet asks how she&nbsp;
survived for so long, but she's unresponsive.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.720
Scarlet rolls her sleeve to take a blood&nbsp;
sample but sees a bite mark on Alice's arm.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.640
Alice insists on seeing her children.

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:00.800
Don is surprised to hear that both&nbsp;
his children and his wife were found.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:05.440
In the detention room, Don asks his kids why&nbsp;
they left, but Tammy demands the truth about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:10.320
Alice. Don lies that he's also confused but tells&nbsp;
them they should be happy that Alice is alive.

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:15.280
Scarlet confirms that Alice is infected&nbsp;
through her blood test but shows no symptoms.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:20.160
She tells General Stone that Alice may&nbsp;
have a natural immunity to the virus. But&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:25.360
she's still a carrier and can infect others.&nbsp;
General Stone decides to have Alice executed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.480
despite Scarlet's insistence that&nbsp;
studying her may lead to a cure.

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:33.600
During this, Don enters the isolation room&nbsp;
and tearfully apologizes to Alice for leaving&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:38.960
her in the cottage. Alice assures him that she&nbsp;
still loves him. Overjoyed with their emotions,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:40.320
Don leans in and kisses her.

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:46.720
With the kiss, Don gets infected. Alice watches&nbsp;
as the crazed Don struggles and vomits blood.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:49.760
Alice frantically wiggles out of&nbsp;
her constraints. But she's trapped.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:52.080
The infected Don brutally kills her.

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:58.800
Now infected, Don starts infecting the soldiers&nbsp;
in his way. General Stone sees the tragedy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.960
He announces Code Red to contain the outbreak.

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:06.880
The soldiers lock down District One. In the&nbsp;
detention room, the soldier watching Tammy and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:11.760
Andy assures them that everything is fine, then&nbsp;
leaves to check things out. But when he returns,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:16.400
he's infected and enraged. Scarlet shoots&nbsp;
the soldier and takes the siblings away.

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:20.400
The District One residents are being&nbsp;
transferred to a secure location.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:26.160
Scarlet tries to get top-priority security&nbsp;
for Tammy and Andy, but the soldiers refuse.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:30.320
In the confusion, Andy gets pushed by the&nbsp;
crowd, losing sight of Tammy and Scarlet.

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:35.200
The residents are taken to the garage for&nbsp;
their safety. They panic when the soldiers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:39.920
lock the doors. Andy finds a quiet&nbsp;
corner to rest. The power shuts down,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:42.000
plunging the frightened residents into darkness.

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:48.320
The fire exit door starts shaking, catching Andy's&nbsp;
and another man's attention. Andy goes closer with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:53.680
the other man shining his flashlight on it. The&nbsp;
infected Don bangs on the door. Andy is shocked&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:58.480
to see his father in his monstrous state. Don goes&nbsp;
for the other man with the flashlight, vomiting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:03.440
blood on his face. Don jumps to another person&nbsp;
just as the man with the flashlight rampages.

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:08.720
The crowd panics as more get infected.&nbsp;
Andy climbs on top of people and cars,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:12.480
then climbs over the vent. He covers&nbsp;
his ears to block out the screams.

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:17.840
A group of people forces the locked doors open,&nbsp;
allowing them to spill out of the building.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:21.120
The soldiers shoot the infected, but&nbsp;
the confusion makes it difficult.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:23.440
Scarlet and Tammy exit the building.

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:28.400
Watching the situation get worse, General&nbsp;
Stone announces to shoot all targets,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:33.840
both infected or uninfected. Scarlet finds a radio&nbsp;
and tells the military to find and evacuate Andy.

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:38.800
Outside, Andy finally makes his way&nbsp;
out of the vents. Doyle receives the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:42.320
order to shoot everyone on the ground and&nbsp;
questions if he could kill innocent people.

00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:47.680
The snipers shoot everyone, causing more&nbsp;
panic. Andy hears someone calling to him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:52.080
He spots a man, Sam, beckoning&nbsp;
him to get into a warehouse.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:56.720
An infected man runs to Andy. But Doyle&nbsp;
saves Andy, allowing him to escape.

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:01.600
One of the snipers gets cornered by the&nbsp;
infected. Doyle shoots his comrade in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:05.840
head to spare him from the infection. Doyle&nbsp;
can't bear killing the innocent anymore.

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:12.080
Inside the warehouse, Andy wanders around and&nbsp;
finds Scarlet and Tammy. Tammy hugs her brother,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:17.360
relieved that he's safe. Andy tells Tammy that&nbsp;
their father is infected. This breaks her heart.

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:20.480
Sam wonders why the military&nbsp;
is targeting everyone.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:25.280
Scarlet explains that the army must exterminate&nbsp;
everyone if they can't contain the outbreak.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.960
They discuss how to escape both the infected&nbsp;
and the military. Doyle walks in, telling them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:35.760
that they can evade the infected during the&nbsp;
night, but not the snipers. Scarlet asks why&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:40.960
he left his post; Doyle explains that he wants to&nbsp;
escape the chaos, offering to help the survivors.

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:46.240
Doyle leads Scarlet, Tammy, Andy,&nbsp;
and a few others out of the building.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:49.840
Doyle gets a hold of Flynn, who informs&nbsp;
him that the Air Cavalry is ordered to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:54.160
bomb District One to contain the outbreak.&nbsp;
He tells Doyle to meet him at Regent Park.

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:58.320
The groups run in the streets when a&nbsp;
sniper starts firing at the survivors.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:02.000
The rest hide in an alley.&nbsp;
Scarlet gets hit in the leg,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.120
but she quickly bandages it up. Doyle notices&nbsp;
that the sniper is panicked, making his shots&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:12.240
less accurate. He asks Sam to help him make&nbsp;
the sniper reveal his position. But Sam is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:17.360
scared and refuses. Hearing this, Andy rushes&nbsp;
across the street, using himself as bait for the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:22.720
sniper. Doyle hurriedly fires at the sniper.&nbsp;
The rest go to Andy, seeing that he's okay.

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:27.680
The survivors climb over the perimeter&nbsp;
walls, watching the cavalry fly overhead.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:29.920
They head into a tunnel for safety.

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:35.200
In his helicopter, Flynn watches as District&nbsp;
One is bombed, with both the infected and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:39.600
non-infected burned alive. Soldiers in&nbsp;
the control room watch the devastation.

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:42.960
A placid Don evades the fire behind a wall while&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:45.840
watching the photo of his wife&nbsp;
and son burn in front of him.

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:50.800
Doyle sees the flames reaching the tunnel.&nbsp;
They rush out of the tunnel before it explodes.

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:56.400
Stone listens to reports of the firebombs.&nbsp;
A camera feed shows a few infected people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:59.840
survived the firebombs and are&nbsp;
tearing down the barricades.

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:05.200
Morning comes, and the survivors rest in Regent&nbsp;
Park. Andy wonders if their mom is still alive,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:06.560
but Tammy doesn't think so.

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:11.440
Doyle admits to Scarlet that he had Andy as&nbsp;
a target, but he couldn't shoot the boy so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:16.560
he left his post. Scarlet informs him that Andy&nbsp;
and Tammy's mother was immune to the rage virus,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:19.520
and she believes that the two siblings&nbsp;
may carry the same immune gene.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:22.960
She stresses that the kids' lives&nbsp;
are more important than theirs.

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:29.360
Flynn radios in, informing Doyle that the infected&nbsp;
are nearby. Doyle tries to escape with the rest,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:34.160
but they're too late. The infected are close.&nbsp;
Doyle orders them to hide in the grass.

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:39.040
The helicopter arrives, Doyle insists&nbsp;
on evacuating the kids over the channel,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:40.560
but Flynn refuses to take them.

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:45.760
Seeing the infected getting near, Sam panics&nbsp;
and grabs hold of the helicopter's skid,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:51.200
begging Flynn to take him away. Flynn flies the&nbsp;
aircraft closer to the infected out of confusion.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:54.160
He aims the rotor blades&nbsp;
down, slicing the infected.

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:58.320
The others run away as the infected reach&nbsp;
them. With infected blood on his face,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:03.200
Sam falls from the helicopter. Flynn flies&nbsp;
the helicopter away, telling Doyle over the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:06.560
radio to head to the stadium but insists&nbsp;
on leaving the rest of the survivors.

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:12.960
The group reaches the park's exit, but Andy trips.&nbsp;
Doyle turns and shoots the infected to save him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:17.520
Doyle tries to contact Flynn again, arguing for&nbsp;
him to ignore the Code Red and save the rest.

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:22.800
More infected people chase after them. The&nbsp;
group runs but is stopped when nerve gas is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:27.200
pumped at the end of the road. They get in a&nbsp;
van and close the vents, covering their faces.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:30.880
The infected bang on the windows&nbsp;
until the gas finally kills them.

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:34.080
Scarlet tries to start the car, but it won't.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:37.840
Doyle sees soldiers using&nbsp;
flamethrowers to burn the infected.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:42.320
He tells Scarlet to get the kids to the stadium&nbsp;
on her own before getting out of the car.

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:47.280
Doyle rushes to the back of the car and&nbsp;
pushes it. When the soldiers get near,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:49.920
he orders Scarlet to start&nbsp;
the car, and it finally does.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:54.000
The trio watch in tears as Doyle is&nbsp;
set ablaze by his fellow soldiers.

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:59.840
Scarlet drives the kids to the stadium, avoiding&nbsp;
roads where the nerve gas rolls in. An Apache&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:05.040
gunship starts firing at them. Scarlet drives&nbsp;
the car into an underground transit to avoid it.

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:10.880
Leaving the car, Scarlet grabs Doyle's sniper&nbsp;
rifle and leads the kids. Upon reaching a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:15.440
dark area, Scarlet watches through the rifle's&nbsp;
night vision to direct the siblings where to go.

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:19.440
Tammy and Andy blindly climb&nbsp;
down a set of escalators.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:21.920
But the two slip down, out of Scarlet's sight.

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:26.400
Following her voice, Scarlet&nbsp;
finds Tammy. Don appears,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:30.320
ambushing Scarlet. He takes the&nbsp;
rifle and slams it on Scarlet's head.

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:34.880
When things go quiet again, Tammy finds&nbsp;
the rifle and looks through the scope,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:36.480
seeing Scarlet's lifeless body.

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:40.880
At the platform, Andy looks for the&nbsp;
others, but Don walks in instead.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:45.040
Andy is frozen as Don tackles him to&nbsp;
the floor, biting him on the neck.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:51.520
Tammy finds them, and Don runs to her. Tammy,&nbsp;
no longer seeing her father in him, shoots Don.

00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:55.280
Tears in her eyes, Tammy walks to her&nbsp;
brother. Believing that he will turn,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:55.280 --> 00:14:00.400
Andy runs away from her. He collapses on the&nbsp;
railway, allowing Tammy to reach him. She&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:05.840
helps him up and checks his left eye, which turns&nbsp;
bloodshot like Alice's was. Andy is also immune.

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:11.520
The two reach the stadium, where Flynn waits.&nbsp;
Flynn aims a gun at them and asks where Doyle is.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:16.400
Tammy shields her brother out of his sight. She&nbsp;
tells him that it's just the two of them now.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:21.600
Flynn finally agrees to help out the siblings,&nbsp;
flying them across The English Channel.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:24.480
Tammy and Andy watch the devastation&nbsp;
that the outbreak caused.

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:31.360
Twenty-eight days later, Flynn's&nbsp;
helicopter is abandoned. A group&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:42.160
of the infected run up a tunnel and&nbsp;
out into the city of Paris, France.
