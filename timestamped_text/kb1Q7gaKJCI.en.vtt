entered the building when asked by an agent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:24.800
if they were clear to execute drakov natasha said&nbsp;
yes despite antonia being there and the building&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:32.480
blew up killing her this has haunted natasha&nbsp;
ever since natasha and eulena grab some supplies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:38.080
and get drinks while reminiscing about the past&nbsp;
with eulena talking about the fake family they had&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:43.280
and the training they went through they know&nbsp;
that in order to bring down drakov and the red&nbsp;&nbsp;

inmates while regaling them with stories about how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:01.520
he was the red guardian russia's first and only&nbsp;
super soldier he tells the others that he battled&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:07.440
captain america although another inmate believes&nbsp;
it to be a lie and alexei breaks his hand for it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:13.760
the alarms go off as natasha and eulena fly in&nbsp;
over the facility alexei uses his super strength&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:19.600
to break out of the building but the guards go&nbsp;
after him and try to attack the chopper natasha&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:25.600
descends and engages in combat with the guards&nbsp;
while elena fires a grenade at a tower this causes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:32.320
an avalanche that buries the facility but natasha&nbsp;
is able to grab alexei in time however both her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:37.920
and elena aren't particularly happy to see them&nbsp;
since he and molina lied to them as kids when they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:43.680
asked alexei if he knows where to find dracoff&nbsp;
he tells them that molina might have an idea&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:48.880
the three make a rough landing near a farm&nbsp;
where melina is using mind control on pigs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:54.400
she reunites with her former fake family and&nbsp;
alexei openly flirts with her which grosses out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.400 --> 00:06:00.320
natasha and elena he even goes to try on his old&nbsp;
red guardian outfit but he struggles to get it on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:05.920
due to gaining weight while sitting at the table&nbsp;
things get tense as natasha says that nothing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:11.440
from their past was real jelena is brought to&nbsp;
tears as she believed their family to be real&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:18.240
later molina tells natasha that her birth mother&nbsp;
was relentlessly searching for her until dracoff&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:24.480
had her killed at the same time alexei tries&nbsp;
to continue being a father figure to yelina&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:29.600
although she is still too angry at him until he&nbsp;
sings american pie which was her favorite song&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:36.480
when they lived in ohio moments later drakov's&nbsp;
agents arrive having been contacted by molina&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:40.720
they subdue natasha yulina and&nbsp;
alexei before being taken away&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:46.720
the group arrives at the red room which is located&nbsp;
in an aerial base for the utmost discretion&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:51.920
molina is brought to drakov although it&nbsp;
turns out to be natasha wearing a disguise&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:57.040
this was part of a plan she staged with molina&nbsp;
back at the house with melina taking natasha's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:03.280
place in the prison cell since she knows how to&nbsp;
open the doors to free herself and alexei julina&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:08.320
nearly has her head cut open until molina talks&nbsp;
to her via an earpiece to inform her of a blade&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:15.040
she can use to free herself meanwhile drakov&nbsp;
reveals several things to natasha first he has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:20.400
protected himself with a pheromone that prevents&nbsp;
anyone from attacking him then he brings out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:26.400
taskmaster who is revealed to be antonia having&nbsp;
survived the explosion with facial disfigurement&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:32.000
and her father has her mind controlled into being&nbsp;
the perfect super soldier he then shows natasha&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.680
the files of all the girls around the world that&nbsp;
he has mind controlled when confronted by guards&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:42.960
molina blows up one of the engines on the red&nbsp;
room sending several guards falling but also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:48.720
causing the whole facility to begin tumbling&nbsp;
toward the ground alexei fights antonia while&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:54.000
yulina and molina battle the guards until molina&nbsp;
helps alexei trap antonia in one of the cells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:59.600
natasha then smashes her face against drakov's&nbsp;
desk to break her nose to block out the pheromone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:05.920
per molina's advice allowing her to attack drakov&nbsp;
he brings in other widows to attack natasha as he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:11.120
makes his getaway but yulina sends the red dust&nbsp;
to the room blowing it up and breaking the widows&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:17.040
from their mind control natasha tells them to go&nbsp;
free and she stops to release antonia from her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:22.880
cell despite acknowledging that she will go after&nbsp;
her the red room starts to come apart even more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:28.880

ship to explode and blow up dracov and the guards&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:47.920
julena is thrown from the impact but natasha jumps&nbsp;
and reaches her in time to give her a parachute&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:55.760
