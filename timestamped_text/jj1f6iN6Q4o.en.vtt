00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.040
Story Recapped here. Today, I'm going to&nbsp;
explain a Sci-fi film called "Altered States."&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.280
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.960
In the late 1960s, Dr. Eddie Jessup began&nbsp;
conducting sensory deprivation experiments&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.560
in an effort to unlock different states of&nbsp;
consciousness. After performing the tests&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.640
on 23 students, he decides to volunteer&nbsp;
and enter the sensory deprivation tank.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.920
Eddie spends nearly five hours inside&nbsp;
the tank before asking his colleague,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.640
Arthur, to let him out so he could take a&nbsp;
look at the E.E.G. tracings. He discloses&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.640
that he experienced intense hallucinations&nbsp;
during his time inside the tank. Eddie is not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.960
particularly religious, but most of the visions&nbsp;
he experienced came from the book of Revelation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.480
Arthur notes that Eddie was crying at one point&nbsp;
because he was re-visiting his father's death.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.480
Eddie tells Arthur that he'd like to try the&nbsp;
experiment again soon, even though they still&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.320
don't know what to look for. He notes that they&nbsp;
won't be asking for a grant from the university&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.280
because they're only going to conduct&nbsp;
the studies to satisfy their curiosity.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.080
During a party at Arthur's home, Eddie&nbsp;
meets Emily, a physical anthropologist,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.240
on her way to acquire her P.H.D. from Columbia.&nbsp;
Eddie immediately warms up to her because she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.760
appears to be as highly motivated and&nbsp;
driven as he is. On the other hand,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.200
Emily finds him fascinating because of his odd&nbsp;
theories about altered states of consciousness.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.080
After leaving the party, Eddie asks Emily&nbsp;
to take him to her home. Emily accedes but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.680
not before warning him that they'll be confined&nbsp;
to the living room because she has a roommate.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.040
After they make love, Eddie tells her that&nbsp;
he had thoughts of God and the crucifixion&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.160
of Jesus as they were copulating.&nbsp;
Eddie explains that he regularly had&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.400
visions of angels and Christ when he was a&nbsp;
child. The visions only stopped at age 16,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.760
when he stopped believing in God after&nbsp;
witnessing his father die horribly of cancer.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.160
When Eddie gets back in the sensory deprivation&nbsp;
tank, he experiences a vision about his father&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.920
at the hospital, along with religious imagery&nbsp;
detailing the crucifixion and the sacrifice of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.560
a seven-eyed goat. A few months pass and Eddie&nbsp;
conducts research on people with schizophrenia.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.440
Emily tells Eddie that she'll be teaching&nbsp;
at Harvard soon and she notes that they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.920
will be spending more time together&nbsp;
since Eddie is also teaching there.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.920
She hints that they should get married since&nbsp;
they've been together for a while. Eddie warns&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.480
Emily that he is a bit crazy, but Emily stresses&nbsp;
that she already knows how eccentric he is.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.840
She reiterates her proposal to get married,&nbsp;
saying they'll deal with it if their marriage&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.360
turns out to be a disaster. Eddie leaves&nbsp;
the room without giving her an answer.
&nbsp;

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.720
After interviewing a schizophrenic patient,&nbsp;
Eddie comes out of the room and tells Emily&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.560
that he wants to get married. Eddie contends&nbsp;
that he doesn't want to lose Emily, noting that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.720
he's unlikely to find anyone as interesting as&nbsp;
her again if she leaves him. Emily remarks that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.320
Eddie's half-hearted proposal is the closest&nbsp;
declaration of love she'll ever get from him.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.160
Several years later, Eddie invites Arthur and his&nbsp;
other colleague, Mason, to his house for a party.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.000
He notifies Arthur that he'll be going to Mexico&nbsp;
in June to meet with the Hinchi Indians, a tribe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.080
known for performing ancient Toltec rituals&nbsp;
with sacred mushrooms. Eddie discloses that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.320
he saw a sensory deprivation tank at the medical&nbsp;
school in Harvard. He then tells Arthur that he's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.920
interested in resuming their experiments with&nbsp;
the isolation tank when he returns from Mexico.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.920
When Arthur sees the mess in one of&nbsp;
the rooms at Eddie's house, his wife,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.560
Sylvia, divulges that Eddie and Emily&nbsp;
are getting a divorce. Sylvia stresses&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.640
that Eddie is the one asking for the divorce,&nbsp;
saying that Emily still loves Eddie very much.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.560
Before they make the divorce official, Emily will&nbsp;
be spending a year in Africa to conduct studies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.480
on apes, and she'll be their children with her.&nbsp;
When Arthur confronts Eddie about the impending&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.560
separation, Eddie explains that he's aware of&nbsp;
Emily's feelings for him. But Eddie thinks that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.800
Emily is only hanging on to their marriage because&nbsp;
she is afraid of being alone. He tells Arthur&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.400
that he'd soon go out of his mind if he doesn't&nbsp;
withdraw himself from the tedious rituals of life.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.400
While having a drink at a bar, Eddie&nbsp;
starts ranting about finding immortality&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.680
and the ultimate truth in the self.&nbsp;
Mason tells him he's going crazy,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.640
but Eddie hints that he's determined to&nbsp;
find the true self through his experiments.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.440
Soon, Eddie goes on his trip to Central&nbsp;
Mexico with his colleague, Eduardo,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.680
to meet with the Hinchi Indians. During the climb&nbsp;
to the mountains, Eduardo reveals that the most&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.920
potent ingredients used in the ceremony are&nbsp;
the Amanita muscaria and the shrub Sinichuiche.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.200
The tribe regards the plant as the "first&nbsp;
flower" because it conjures ancient memories.

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:45.040
Eduardo asks the tribe leader, Brujo, what Eddie&nbsp;
should expect when he goes through the ritual.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.880
Brujo tells them that Eddie will return to the&nbsp;
first soul, and he'll enter a void where he'll see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.120
a spot that will turn into a crack, which is the&nbsp;
space between nothingness. Out of the emptiness,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.720
Eddie's unborn soul will emerge.
………………………………..&nbsp;

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.360
That night, Brujo takes Eddie to a cave to perform&nbsp;
the ceremony. Brujo cuts Eddie's hand with a knife&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.360
and lets the blood drip into a bowl filled with&nbsp;
a mixture. Eddie calls out to Eduardo for help,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:08.000
but Eduardo just watches as Brujo continues.&nbsp;
Brujo takes a sip of the concoction and passes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.240
it to the other tribe members as they chant.&nbsp;
Finally, the tribe leader nods at Eddie,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:16.800
signaling that it's his turn to taste the mixture.&nbsp;
After taking a sip, Eddie starts hallucinating.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:21.200
As the tribe dances around, Eddie sees a vision&nbsp;
of himself with his wife sitting in a garden. A&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:25.600
snake slithers out and wraps itself around Eddie's&nbsp;
neck. A large lizard suddenly appears in front of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.000
him and transforms into Emily. Eddie lies down and&nbsp;
sleeps as the dust start covering their bodies.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.560
When Eddie wakes up, he notices a mutilated&nbsp;
lizard on the ground. Brujo tells him that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.400
he killed a lizard during his hallucinations.&nbsp;
Eddie is furious that he didn't learn much from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.840
the ceremony, saying the Natives had played&nbsp;
a joke on him to make him look like a fool.

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.160
Eddie takes home some of the concoction so he&nbsp;
could analyze it. When he tries the mixture at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.000
the university, Eddie experiences visions of hell&nbsp;
and some of the events described in the book of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.640
Revelation. When Eddie passes out from the drug,&nbsp;
Mason advises them to stop the experiment because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:58.880
he fears that the mixture could cause irreversible&nbsp;
damage to Eddie's body. Arthur, however,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:02.160
contends that Eddie wouldn't allow anything&nbsp;
to stop him from conducting the experiments.

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:06.160
Mason warns Eddie that the mixture&nbsp;
he's taking is not like L.S.D. or any&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.280
psychedelic drugs that have already&nbsp;
been tested by other scientists.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.880
Eddie argues that the Hinchi Indians didn't&nbsp;
suffer any debilitating effects from the mixture&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:16.400
even though they’ve been drinking it regularly&nbsp;
for centuries. Eddie further points out that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.480
he has already tried injecting the mixture into&nbsp;
rats, and there are noticeable effects so far.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:24.480
Eddie takes them to the basement of the university&nbsp;
to show them the sensory deprivation tank.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:28.320
Eddie tells Mason that he doesn't get any images&nbsp;
from his hallucinations from the concoction, so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:31.840
he surmises that the images would show up when he&nbsp;
drinks the mixture in conjunction with the tank.

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.880
Mason, worrying that something&nbsp;
wrong could happen to Eddie,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:38.880
tells them that he no longer wants to take part&nbsp;
in the experiment. However, while Arthur is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:43.040
preparing Eddie for the experiment, Mason stops&nbsp;
by, saying someone has to keep an eye on them.

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:47.120
After shutting the doors of the tank, Eddie's&nbsp;
hallucinations take him to grasslands where he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:51.440
comes across vast woodlands and newly born&nbsp;
mountains. After a while, he witnesses the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:55.280
birth of the first human, not far from chimps&nbsp;
in appearance but capable of walking upright.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.040
Soon, more of them appear, and Eddie&nbsp;
becomes one of them. Eddie relates to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.840
his colleagues that he's killing&nbsp;
a goat and eating its raw flesh.

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:06.080
Mason is worried that Eddie is having a bad trip,&nbsp;
so he opens the tank to check on him. Arthur&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:09.200
asks Eddie if he wants to get out, but Eddie&nbsp;
insists on going through with the experiment.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:13.120
Mason and Arthur are both startled when they&nbsp;
suddenly hear a loud beastly grunt coming from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:17.600
the tank. Arthur asks Eddie again if he wants&nbsp;
to stop, but he tells them to leave him alone.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.800
After spending more than four hours inside&nbsp;
the tank, they finally open the hatch to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:25.200
bring Eddie out. But to their shock, they find&nbsp;
him shivering with blood on his mouth. Arthur&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:28.400
covers him with a blanket while Mason checks&nbsp;
his mouth to see where the blood is coming from.

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:32.720
Eddie is unable to speak, so he&nbsp;
asks Arthur for a pen and a pad.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:36.160
In the notepad, Eddie asks them to take his&nbsp;
blood and get him to an x-ray so they could&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:40.480
take pictures of his neck before he reconstitutes.&nbsp;
Eddie contends that his hallucination manifested&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:44.960
into his body, but Mason thinks that Eddie is&nbsp;
still out of his mind. Despite his skepticism,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:48.400
Mason agrees to put him under various tests&nbsp;
to determine the physical effects of the drug.

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:52.880
While Eddie is getting an X-ray, Arthur advises&nbsp;
Mason not to tell Eddie about the blood on his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:56.800
mouth because he'd claim that it's the blood of&nbsp;
the goat he ate in his vision. Mason surmises&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:00.400
that Eddie must've had a seizure during his&nbsp;
hallucinations and bit his lip while convulsing.

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:04.640
As soon as Eddie gets his voice back, he asks&nbsp;
Mason to keep anyone else from finding out about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:08.720
his condition, believing that he lost his voice&nbsp;
because he regressed into an ape-like creature.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:12.320
Mason, however, intends to take the X-ray&nbsp;
films to the radiology department because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:16.400
he wants someone reliable to assess Eddie's&nbsp;
physical condition. When Mason shows the films&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:20.000
to the radiologist, the doctor tells Mason&nbsp;
that it appears to be an X-ray of a gorilla.

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:24.640
That night, Eddie wakes up next to a female&nbsp;
student and sees his body transforming.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:28.320
He suppresses his grunts, trying not to wake&nbsp;
up the student, and goes to the bathroom.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:32.000
The transformation continues while Eddie is&nbsp;
taking a shower, but everything soon returns&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.320
to normal when he calms himself down. While&nbsp;
taking notes about the experiment, he smiles,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:39.760
thinking that he’s close to a breakthrough,&nbsp;
but soon, the transformation starts again.

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:43.600
A few months after the experiment, Eddie&nbsp;
fetches Emily and their daughters from the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:48.080
airport to drive them to their new home. While&nbsp;
unpacking, Emily discloses that Mason already&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:51.520
told her about the experiments and the genetic&nbsp;
regression he went through several months ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:55.360
She fears that Eddie may have leukemia&nbsp;
or lymphoma, but Eddie points out that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:58.640
he was already subjected to several tests,&nbsp;
and there has been no evidence of cancer.

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:02.400
Emily notes that the results of Eddie's&nbsp;
blood tests showed some characteristics of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:06.480
simian blood groups. Eddie becomes increasingly&nbsp;
agitated as he tells Emily about his intention&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:10.640
to return to the isolation tank. He wants to&nbsp;
determine if the regression will happen again,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:13.840
but he gets furious, remembering that&nbsp;
Mason wouldn't let him back into the lab.

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:17.600
Eddie suspects that he entered another&nbsp;
consciousness during his time at the tank,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:20.480
and the drug allowed him to externalize the&nbsp;
primitive consciousness he encountered in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:23.920
the hallucination. He tells Emily that&nbsp;
he will be repeating the experiment,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:26.080
so he could ask other scientists&nbsp;
to validate the results.

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:31.120
That night, Eddie goes to the lab and enters the&nbsp;
tank without Arthur's supervision. Emily calls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:35.040
Mason and tells him that Eddie seems like he's&nbsp;
on the verge of a breakdown. She tells Mason that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:39.280
she's worried about Eddie because he ranted like a&nbsp;
madman all afternoon before he disappeared. After&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:43.120
some time, Eddie emerges from the tank with his&nbsp;
body totally transformed into a primitive human.

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:47.760
Mason wakes up from his lab and hears a&nbsp;
thud, so he goes outside to investigate.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:51.600
When he opens the door to the isolation tank&nbsp;
room, an ape-like creature emerges and runs away&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:55.840
growling. The hominid chases Mason, so he runs&nbsp;
to the security room and tells the guard that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:59.680
there's a monkey on the loose in the basement.&nbsp;
When the hominid sees them, the creature runs to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:03.600
the boiler room and hides in the ceiling pipes.&nbsp;
The guard clangs on the pipes to see if anything&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:08.320
would emerge. Soon, the hominid drops down from&nbsp;
the pipes and attacks the guard with a baton.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:12.400
After hitting the guard several times in the head,&nbsp;
the creature turns to Mason and chases him. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:16.000
hominid soon catches up to Mason and hits him hard&nbsp;
in the head while he was trying to open a door.

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:20.560
The hominid runs out of the building as other&nbsp;
guards chase after him. While running around the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:24.960
streets, he tries looking for something to eat in&nbsp;
the garbage bins, but a pack of dogs chases him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:28.880
He climbs up a building, and the dogs eventually&nbsp;
leave except for one dog that continues chasing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:33.680
him. Soon, the hominid ends up in a zoo, where&nbsp;
he encounters different animals. He drinks from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:38.000
a fountain and tries to grab a piece of meat from&nbsp;
a cage, but a tiger emerges and lunges at him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.560
As he continues wandering around the zoo, he comes&nbsp;
across a herd of sheep. He tries climbing up a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:47.200
fence to run after them, but he gets electrocuted,&nbsp;
so he climbs up a tree. When he gets to the other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:51.280
side, he throws a rock and hits a sheep in the&nbsp;
head. While gnawing on the sheep, the ape-like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:54.880
creature grunts and growls, scaring away any&nbsp;
other animal that might pose a threat to him.

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:59.840
Soon, the zoo's security guard arrives and&nbsp;
sees the dead sheep. Just a few steps away,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:04.000
Eddie lies face down, completely naked&nbsp;
and unconscious. Eddie is taken to jail,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.320
but he is soon released when Emily posts bail.&nbsp;
He tells Emily that he remembers large fragments&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:11.680
of what happened earlier that night. When they&nbsp;
get home, Eddie narrates that he has entered&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:15.360
a primitive consciousness, and he can only&nbsp;
remember what made sense to him in that state.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:19.600
He points out that he was totally primal, and his&nbsp;
only focus at the time was surviving and eating.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:23.200
Despite his primitive state, he feels like&nbsp;
it was the most satisfying time of his life,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:25.520
though he worries that he might have&nbsp;
killed someone at the university.

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:29.840
Mason arrives and tells Eddie to report to the&nbsp;
security office at the school because the ape&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:34.640
that ran out of the isolation tank room almost&nbsp;
killed a security guard. The following day, Emily&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:38.080
takes a look at Eddie's files while listening&nbsp;
to the tapes of his sessions at the tank.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:41.920
As she hears Eddie's beastly grunts, Emily starts&nbsp;
to worry that Eddie might really be regressing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:46.240
That night, Emily has bad dreams about Eddie, so&nbsp;
she gives him a call and goes to his apartment.

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:50.080
Emily tells Eddie that she thinks that his&nbsp;
experiences at the tank are not limited to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:54.960
hallucinations. She fears that Eddie is undergoing&nbsp;
genetic transformation, so she asks him not to try&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:59.520
the experiments again. Eddie, however, tells her&nbsp;
that he wants to find out if the transformation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:04.160
actually happened. Emily warns Eddie that he may&nbsp;
be causing irreversible genetic damage to himself,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:07.280
but Eddie argues that his experiences&nbsp;
were beyond genetics and matter.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:10.240
He believes that he may regress back to&nbsp;
the first thought, and he could unlock&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:13.840
secrets that would prompt humanity to&nbsp;
reassess their perception of space-time.

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:17.520
When Emily visits the lab, Mason is already&nbsp;
preparing Eddie to go inside the sensory&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:21.600
deprivation tank. Eddie warns Mason that he&nbsp;
may emerge from the tank in a primitive state,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:24.240
so he tells Mason to sedate&nbsp;
him while he's still inside.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:28.080
After observing Eddie for more than two hours,&nbsp;
Emily tells them to bring Eddie out of the tank,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:31.840
fearing that he might be damaging his genetic&nbsp;
structure. Arthur points out that Eddie will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:35.600
be vexed if they stop the experiment too&nbsp;
soon. Not long, Eddie starts screaming&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:39.440
inside the tank as his body transforms.&nbsp;
Mason tries to take him out of the tank,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:44.720
but he's slammed to the wall by a blast of energy.&nbsp;
Emily tries to open the tank, but Mason stops her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:47.920
Meanwhile, Arthur falls unconscious while&nbsp;
he's staring at the light from the monitor.

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:52.640
Mason takes Emily outside the lab, but she keeps&nbsp;
struggling, so he knocks her out before going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:57.520
back inside. When Emily regains consciousness,&nbsp;
he finds Arthur and Mason lying on the floor.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:01.440
From the observation room, Emily watches the tank&nbsp;
light up as Eddie continues his transformation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.880
Soon, the tank bursts open, leaving a whirlpool&nbsp;
in its place. With Eddie nowhere to be found,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:11.440
Emily calls out to him across the vortex. Eddie&nbsp;
rapidly regresses into the primordial cells,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:15.360
but before he is totally erased out of existence,&nbsp;
Emily reaches into the whirlpool and brings him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:19.600
back. After getting Eddie back to his apartment,&nbsp;
Mason tells Emily that his vital signs are good,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:22.800
but he'll probably sleep for a day or two&nbsp;
due to the amount of drugs in his body.

00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:26.880
Emily expresses her frustration about falling&nbsp;
desperately in love with Eddie despite his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:30.480
lack of concern for her. Emily confesses&nbsp;
that he's tried to fall in love with other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:34.240
men while she was away, but she can't get&nbsp;
Eddie out of her mind. She's dismayed that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:37.840
Eddie never cared about her because he's&nbsp;
only concerned about finding the truth.

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:41.120
As Arthur and Mason argue about the&nbsp;
terrifying implications of the experiment,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:44.720
Eddie lies catatonic on the bed. Arthur&nbsp;
points out that they've experienced an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:48.080
inexplicable physical phenomenon that&nbsp;
night, and he wants to learn more.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:51.520
He tells Mason that he wants to repeat the&nbsp;
experiment with other subjects, but Mason&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:54.160
argues that they shouldn't administer&nbsp;
the untested drug to innocent people.

00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:58.560
After Mason and Arthur leave, Eddie wakes&nbsp;
up and sees Emily lying on the couch.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:02.400
He covers her with a blanket and lies down on&nbsp;
the floor next to her. The following morning,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:05.840
Eddie tells Emily that she means so much to&nbsp;
him because she saved him from total oblivion.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:09.920
He discloses that when he came across the&nbsp;
moment where life began, he was terrified&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:14.000
because he only found total emptiness. Eddie&nbsp;
confesses that the terrifying emptiness inside&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.080
him is still trying to devour him, and Emily is&nbsp;
the only one that's keeping him together. Emily&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:21.200
tells him to come back to the real world,&nbsp;
but he thinks it might be too late for him.

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:25.680
When Eddie starts experiencing transformations&nbsp;
again, Emily tells him to fight it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:30.480
Emily reaches out and grabs his hand, but Eddie's&nbsp;
primordial energy rapidly devours her. Horrified&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:34.880
by the thought of losing Emily, Eddie fights as&nbsp;
hard as he can to stop the regression. When Eddie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:39.120
finally returns to his normal form, he embraces&nbsp;
Emily, causing the energy that enveloped her body&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:43.520
to dissipate. Emily smiles in sheer delight and&nbsp;
joy when she finally hears Eddie say he loves her.
