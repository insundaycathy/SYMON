00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.850
Welcome to the breakdown where we breakdown
all the messed up shit.

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:13.360
Today we are breaking down the last two episodes
of Corpse Party, a pretty gorey and fucked

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:14.360
anime.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.710
Make sure you guys watched the first breakdown
on the first two episodes if you haven't,

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:19.449
link will be in the description!

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:25.140
Anyway lets get into the breakdown!

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.919
So, we are back with these people who are
literally fucked.

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:34.250
Kizami takes a picture of Morshige, but then
turns his attention towards Yuka, offering

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.550
to be the one to end her life.

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:41.350
Next after another earthquake it cuts to sexy
mama Naomi who gets a phone call from her

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.670
mamma, then someone else invades the call
and is asking for help!

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.730
Satoshi acts like the biggest derp of all
derps by continuing investigating, when he

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.940
could be looking for his sister, who in the
meantime is running desperately from that

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.440
sick fuck Kizami.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.560
The red dress girl, guess I'll just say her
name, Sachiko, helps Yuka un away and then

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.339
Kizami gets bodied by the same guy who knocked
out Sensei.

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.520
Satoshi then meets up with Nano, the sick
spirit and he learns that they completely

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.360
messed up the ritual in the beginning!

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.940
Then she teleports him to the one he is most
thinking of.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.680
Back with Shinozaki and Yoshiki, they wake
up in the original school although everyone

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.680
else is missing.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.500
Then Shinozaki finds a portal which turns
into one of the dead spirit girls.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.180
She explains how she got kidnapped, but she
also explains that the two's efforts to appease

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.040
the spirits weren't enough.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.860
They learn that if they wanna release their
friends, they gotta go back, comment below

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.230
on what you guys would do, cuz if it was me.

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:39.860
They gonna find their own way back!

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.840
The spirit girl puts Shinozaki in her position
back to how she was killed along with he other

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:45.840
kids.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.700
Off screen, the killer stabs a girls eyes
out, cuts someone's tongue out, and slowly

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.180
beheads another girl.

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.090
Then we see the real killer was in fact Sachiko,
the red dress girl.

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.640
Sachiko then stabs Shinozaki in the eye and
pulls it clean out.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.980
Then she wakes back up and the two decide
to go back inside to save their friends but

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:06.410
Yoshiki pussies out!

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:11.000
Then we get this shot(Naomi's Panties) and
she starts crying out which Satoshi hears,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.020
seems like the voids have mixed.

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:19.040
Wait wait wait, so Nano takes Satoshi to the
one he is most thinking of.....

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.239
Which is Naomi.

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.219
Naomi!.

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:25.340
Not his fucking SISTER!?!?

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.510
Fuck Satoshi.

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.710
Naomi then takes Satoshi to Seiko's dead body.

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:36.110
Next back to Yuka, Sachiko threatens Yuka
and she pisses herself as Sachiko laughs evilly.

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.769
Then some fleshy guy gabs Yuka and starts
choking her out.

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:45.260
Everybody hears Yuka crying and we see she
has been tied up by the fleshy guy.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.459
Now guys we got some child torture so buckle
up.

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:51.700
He stabs her in the thigh, and then cuts her
eye out of her skull.

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.010
Then he stabs her in the torso before Yoshiki
comes in and beheads the guy.

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.469
Then he gets into a fight with he old teacher
and we see he got cut across the ye.

00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:05.939
Then he gets disemboweled by the old teacher
and then gets skull fisted by him too, what

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:09.340
a terrible way to go, its like a Jason Voorhees
type of death.

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.689
Satoshi finds Shinozaki and Yuka and they
meet up with Naomi.

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:16.980
Yuka is still alive but dies in her brother's
arms, at least she didn't go out like no punk.

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.150
Then we see Sachiko laugh on.

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.819
Episode Four Starts off with he kids talking
about how Sachiko is the mastermind behind

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:22.819
everything.

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:26.870
The only way to escape is to put all the spirits
to rest and get a confession from the killer.

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.290
They need the charm as well but it seems Naomi
might be missing hers.

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.900
They come across an infirmary and they come
across another spirit before running away.

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:40.450
Shinozaki meets up with Nano chan and she
goes all crazy She shows the crazy spirit

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.700
some contradicting images, causing her to
vomit and then puts her spirit to rest as

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:45.700
well.

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.999
We learn that Sachiko is bringing sorry fucks
to the void to keep her dead mother from being

00:03:49.999 --> 00:03:50.999
lonely.

00:03:50.999 --> 00:03:56.290
Sachiko's mother is Yoshie san, a teacher
who died from falling down the stairs and

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.810
the woman that was seen earlier throughout
the episodes.

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.330
They come across a room with seals everywhere
and Satoshi sees a flashback of the Principal

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:07.010
cutting out Sachiko's tongue and stabbing
her dead body.

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:12.200
Shinozaki comes across Sensei but then the
sensei gets beheaded by a loose board as an

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.560
earthquake happens.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.900
Satoshi and Naomi then find themselves in
some murder room and they hide as someone's

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:18.900
coming.

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.760
It's the old teacher who has Seikos body and
he cuts her tongue out and puts it in a bucket

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.100
of tongues.

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.190
Naomi chases after the old teacher and finds
a TV.

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:32.100
Meanwhile, Shinozaki wakes back up in another
gore room, but then Satoshi and Shinozaki

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:37.470
get told by the spirit that Naomi is under
control, but if she beaks free she can escape.

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:39.810
Then the two find Sachikos dead body.

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:43.890
But demon Sachiko comes and stabs Satoshi
right n the hand.

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:47.110
He subdues her as Sachiko's good spirit spawns.

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:52.450
We find out that Naomi was the one who actually
hung Seiko, but she wasn't in her right mind.

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:57.130
Satoshi tries appealing to Sachiko's spirit
as Seiko calls Naomi from the grave, forgiving

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:59.090
Naomi and breaking the curse.

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:03.580
Naomi finds the two and Satoshi reveals that
he knows that Sachiko and the mother were

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:04.950
the final victim.

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:09.640
He freezes Sachiko and we see a flashback
that the principal killed Sachiko's mother

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.670
and suffocated Sachiko.

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:17.370
This calms Sachiko down and then Satoshi gives
Sachiko what she had before she died, and

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:20.140
Sachiko asks for forgiveness as her spirit
goes to rest.

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:24.700
I don't understand actually, so if she was
the last victim, does that mean she didn't

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:25.800
kill those little kids?

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.150
Because if she did, I don't got no sympathy
for her.

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:32.690
The girl spirit comes back as the school starts
breaking down.

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:37.440
The three begin their escape using the charm,
and Satoshi finds out that Naomi is using

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:41.380
a random charm paper which could result them
into failure.

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:43.980
He offers his to her and he will use Yuka's.

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:49.050
They begin their ritual and they teleport,
the three succeed, but the two girls carry

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:55.190
a scared face, and we see Satoshi didn't make
it back and the two girls hold each of his

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:56.190
arms.

00:05:56.190 --> 00:06:00.150
The anime ends with Naomi's mother crying
to a doctor about Naomi being in a disturbed

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:05.270
state and all the people who died before have
been erased from history all together.

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:09.350
Well that was pretty messed up, the game is
no where near this gory even if it does keep

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:11.000
the disturbing themes.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.190
Anyway lets talk about the most disturbed
moment and most enjoyed moment in that Spooky

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:19.960
Stuff.

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.540
So right into it, the most disturbed moment
is Yuka's torture.

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:23.540
If it would have been any other character,
I'd probably say the same, but I think this

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:30.790
would have been avoided if it wasn't for Satoshi.

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:35.760
The most enjoyed moment was when Yoshiki came
and beheaded the guy that was torturing Yuka.

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:40.630
He went out in such a stupid way too!

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:45.450
And that's it, this is considered one of the
goriest anime ever, and I can't blame them.

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:54.710
Thanks for 100 subscribers it feels great
to see 

00:06:54.710 --> 00:07:04.840
the channel grow, and if you like this video
