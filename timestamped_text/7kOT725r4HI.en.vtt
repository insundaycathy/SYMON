00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.961
Hey everyone.

00:00:02.961 --> 00:00:05.143
Welcome back to Movie Recap.

00:00:05.143 --> 00:00:07.150
Today&nbsp;I'm gonna show you a movie called,

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:08.479
A Quiet Place.

00:00:08.479 --> 00:00:10.722
It is a 2018 American horror film

00:00:10.722 --> 00:00:13.888
directed by&nbsp;John Krasinski and starring Emily Blunt.

00:00:13.888 --> 00:00:16.774
The movie is about a family is forced to live&nbsp;in silence

00:00:16.774 --> 00:00:19.944
while hiding from monsters with ultra-sensitive hearing.

00:00:19.944 --> 00:00:21.338
Let s start!

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.061
The film opens 89 days after an alien invasion

00:00:35.061 --> 00:00:38.437
devastates the planet and wipes out most of humanity.

00:00:38.437 --> 00:00:41.388
The monsters are blind but have strong&nbsp;hearing,

00:00:41.388 --> 00:00:43.275
so they hunt wherever they hear noise.

00:00:43.275 --> 00:00:45.915
The Abbott family, parents Lee and Evelyn,

00:00:45.915 --> 00:00:47.371
carefully looks through a cluster

00:00:47.371 --> 00:00:50.018
of uncollected prescription bottles for her eldest son,

00:00:50.018 --> 00:00:51.656
Marcus,&nbsp;who is sick.

00:00:51.656 --> 00:00:54.748
Evelyn gives Marcus some medication and uses sign language

00:00:54.748 --> 00:00:58.726
to reassure her Deaf&nbsp;daughter, Regan, that her brother is okay.

00:00:58.726 --> 00:01:01.308
Regan then checks on her younger brother, Beau,

00:01:01.308 --> 00:01:03.852
who is drawing a picture of a rocket on the floor.

00:01:03.852 --> 00:01:07.411
He signs to Regan, "Rocket. That's how we'll get&nbsp;away.",

00:01:07.411 --> 00:01:11.634
then climbs the mostly empty shelves and reaches for a space shuttle toy.

00:01:11.634 --> 00:01:13.208
The toy falls&nbsp;from the shelf,

00:01:13.208 --> 00:01:16.506
but Regan scrambles to catch it before it hits the floor.

00:01:16.506 --> 00:01:19.134
Meanwhile, the family's&nbsp;father, Lee Abbott,

00:01:19.134 --> 00:01:21.406
has scavenged some electronics for a radio

00:01:21.406 --> 00:01:24.928
which will boost its signal as well&nbsp;as some cutting pliers for Regan.

00:01:24.928 --> 00:01:27.819
Evelyn signs to her family that "It'll be dark soon"

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:29.289
and they&nbsp;prepare to leave

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:31.744
when looks of horror come across their faces.

00:01:31.744 --> 00:01:34.525
Beau has the electronic space&nbsp;shuttle toy in his hands

00:01:34.525 --> 00:01:38.116
which Lee carefully takes from him removing its 2 AA batteries.

00:01:38.116 --> 00:01:40.956
He&nbsp;signs to his youngest son, "It's too loud."

00:01:40.956 --> 00:01:42.399
As the family departs,

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:46.320
Regan sneaks the toy back to&nbsp;Beau who then grabs the batteries on his way out.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.030
The Abbotts silently walk back home on&nbsp;a trail of sand they've created.

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.794
As they come to a walking bridge,

00:01:54.794 --> 00:01:57.887
they suddenly hear the&nbsp;electronic sound of the space shuttle toy

00:01:57.887 --> 00:01:59.788
from Beau who is pulling up the rear.

00:01:59.788 --> 00:02:03.321
A horrified Lee&nbsp;races back toward his son, but it's too late,

00:02:03.321 --> 00:02:06.443
an alien creature quickly seizes and kills Beau.

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:10.535
The Abbotts are home on their family farm.

00:02:10.535 --> 00:02:12.748
Lee is in the basement of the farm house

00:02:12.748 --> 00:02:16.432
where he has set&nbsp;up an extensive surveillance system of cameras and monitors

00:02:16.432 --> 00:02:18.347
as well as his radio and electronics

00:02:18.347 --> 00:02:21.478
which he uses in the hope of contacting any other survivors.

00:02:21.478 --> 00:02:25.690
There are also scores of various&nbsp;news clippings which report of an alien invasion,

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.356
as well as notes from Lee that read, "blind",&nbsp;"attack sound", and "armour".

00:02:31.518 --> 00:02:35.764
Evelyn, meanwhile, is in a cellar where she hangs a mobile she has&nbsp;crafted.

00:02:35.764 --> 00:02:36.952
Evelyn is pregnant.

00:02:36.952 --> 00:02:41.563
She sets up an oxygen tank which is connected to an infant breathing&nbsp;mask.

00:02:41.563 --> 00:02:44.688
It sits next to a covered, sound-proof baby crib.

00:02:44.688 --> 00:02:47.251
Lee has moved up to the top of his grain&nbsp;silo

00:02:47.251 --> 00:02:49.669
where he looks through pictures of Beau.

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.039
Evelyn asks Regan to tell her father that dinner&nbsp;is ready,

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:56.597
which she reluctantly does.

00:02:56.597 --> 00:02:58.058
After silent prayer,

00:02:58.058 --> 00:03:01.247
they eat quiet foods on leaves of lettuce&nbsp;instead of plates.

00:03:01.247 --> 00:03:04.161
Afterwards, Regan and Marcus play Monopoly

00:03:04.161 --> 00:03:08.083
when he accidentally knocks&nbsp;over a lantern which sets the rug on fire.

00:03:08.083 --> 00:03:11.961
Lee quickly puts it out, and they quietly wait&nbsp;for the consequences.

00:03:11.961 --> 00:03:16.185
It seems as though they've dodged a bullet but then hear a loud noise on the&nbsp;roof.

00:03:16.185 --> 00:03:18.384
Lee looks out the window and is startled,

00:03:18.384 --> 00:03:21.377
but relieved to see a raccoon fall from the&nbsp;roof.

00:03:21.377 --> 00:03:23.099
He heads down into the basement

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:27.020
to work on a cochlear implant processor which will help&nbsp;his daughter hear.

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:29.271
Evelyn comes down where they share a smile

00:03:29.271 --> 00:03:33.137
and a set of ear buds as they&nbsp;slow dance to Neil Young's Harvest Moon.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.912
While Lee is pouring down more sand on their&nbsp;walking paths,

00:03:37.912 --> 00:03:40.815
Evelyn is in the cellar checking her blood pressure.

00:03:40.815 --> 00:03:43.297
Her due date is just a&nbsp;couple weeks away.

00:03:43.297 --> 00:03:45.568
She places a stethoscope to her abdomen

00:03:45.568 --> 00:03:47.693
revealing a strong healthy heartbeat.

00:03:47.693 --> 00:03:49.666
Regan enters the house being careful

00:03:49.666 --> 00:03:52.658
to walk only on the marked parts of the floor which don't&nbsp;creek

00:03:52.658 --> 00:03:56.324
and wants to go down into the basement, but her dad stops her.

00:03:57.462 --> 00:03:59.818
He has added small&nbsp;amplifiers from a stereo

00:03:59.818 --> 00:04:02.005
to her new cochlear implant processor

00:04:02.005 --> 00:04:03.669
and wants to put them on Regan,

00:04:03.669 --> 00:04:06.745
but she stops him and signs that they never work.

00:04:06.745 --> 00:04:08.139
Lee, disheartened,

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:11.599
hands them to her instead&nbsp;and starts to set out on an excursion.

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.461
He wants Marcus to come with him,

00:04:15.461 --> 00:04:18.278
but the boy&nbsp;is scared and doesn't want to go.

00:04:18.278 --> 00:04:20.689
Instead, it's Regan who wants to go,

00:04:20.689 --> 00:04:23.767
but Lee tells her&nbsp;to stay and take care of her mom.

00:04:23.767 --> 00:04:27.503
She runs to her room and tries on the new cochlear implant&nbsp;processor.

00:04:27.503 --> 00:04:29.917
When they don't work, she's devastated.

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.347
Regan packs a bag which includes her cutting&nbsp;pliers

00:04:35.347 --> 00:04:38.632
and a wrapped object from her dresser, then leaves the farm.&nbsp;

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.048
Lee has taken his son to the river where he&nbsp;teaches him that making

00:04:44.048 --> 00:04:47.820
small sounds is okay as long as louder sounds are nearby.

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.938
Next to a&nbsp;waterfall they can speak freely

00:04:49.938 --> 00:04:52.323
to each other without fear of being heard.

00:04:52.323 --> 00:04:55.277
Marcus asks his dad&nbsp;why he didn't let Regan come

00:04:55.277 --> 00:04:57.443
and if he blames her for what happened to Beau,

00:04:57.443 --> 00:04:59.140
because she blames&nbsp;herself.

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:01.115
When Lee says it was no one's fault,

00:05:01.115 --> 00:05:04.198
Marcus tells him if he still loves her, he&nbsp;should tell her.

00:05:04.198 --> 00:05:05.711
During this conversation,

00:05:05.711 --> 00:05:07.624
Regan has arrived at the walking bridge

00:05:07.624 --> 00:05:10.597
where&nbsp;a makeshift memorial has been constructed for Beau.

00:05:10.597 --> 00:05:12.724
She unwraps the object from her dresser

00:05:12.724 --> 00:05:15.125
which we discover is the space shuttle toy,

00:05:15.125 --> 00:05:17.977
then uses the pliers to cut a wire which enables&nbsp;the toy

00:05:17.977 --> 00:05:19.840
to light up without making any noise.

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.760
Back at home, Evelyn is carrying&nbsp;a laundry bag up from the basement&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.652
when it gets snagged on the stairs.

00:05:27.652 --> 00:05:30.538
She manages to pull it loose causing her to fall

00:05:30.538 --> 00:05:33.360
and exposing the point of&nbsp;a nail sticking up from the stair.

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:37.216
On the way back home,

00:05:37.216 --> 00:05:40.590
Lee and Marcus are startled&nbsp;by an old man coming out of the woods,

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:43.991
and then notice the dead body of his wife on the ground&nbsp;nearby.

00:05:43.991 --> 00:05:46.552
Lee implores the old man to stay silent,

00:05:46.552 --> 00:05:48.875
but instead he lets out a primal scream.

00:05:48.875 --> 00:05:51.004
Lee grabs&nbsp;Marcus and runs as the man

00:05:51.004 --> 00:05:53.576
is quickly scooped up and killed by an alien.

00:05:53.576 --> 00:05:55.738
Back home, Evelyn's&nbsp;water breaks.

00:05:55.738 --> 00:05:57.500
She heads down to the basement

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:01.155
and impales her foot on the exposed nail coming&nbsp;up from the stair.

00:06:01.155 --> 00:06:03.013
She manages not to scream out,

00:06:03.013 --> 00:06:05.065
but drops the picture frames she was holding

00:06:05.065 --> 00:06:07.075
which draws an alien into the house.

00:06:07.075 --> 00:06:08.950
Evelyn pulls her foot off the nail,

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:12.072
switches on the&nbsp;red light-bulbs which run across the property

00:06:12.072 --> 00:06:13.951
and serve as a warning signal,

00:06:13.951 --> 00:06:16.851
and searches&nbsp;the shelves for a mechanical kitchen timer.

00:06:16.851 --> 00:06:19.740
The alien slowly walks down the stairs into the&nbsp;basement

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:21.837
listening for any evidence of life.

00:06:21.837 --> 00:06:23.274
When the timer goes off,

00:06:23.274 --> 00:06:26.025
the alien&nbsp;attacks it as Evelyn runs upstairs.

00:06:26.025 --> 00:06:28.535
She sees another alien in the front yard.

00:06:28.535 --> 00:06:32.080
Evelyn goes upstairs into the bathroom and sinks into the tub.

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:34.880
She's starting to&nbsp;give birth as the alien comes upstairs.

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.608
Lee has returned home and is horrified

00:06:39.608 --> 00:06:42.134
to see&nbsp;that the red lights have been switched on.

00:06:42.134 --> 00:06:44.407
He signs the word "rocket" to his son.

00:06:44.407 --> 00:06:48.752
Then tells&nbsp;him, "I need you to make a sound louder. You can do it."

00:06:48.752 --> 00:06:52.214
Lee grabs his shotgun as Marcus sprints&nbsp;to a designated area

00:06:52.214 --> 00:06:55.567
and lights a fuse which sets off a series of fireworks.

00:06:55.567 --> 00:06:57.959
Lee searches the&nbsp;house and walks into the bathroom

00:06:57.959 --> 00:07:01.273
where he sees an empty bathtub covered in his wife's blood.

00:07:01.273 --> 00:07:03.637
He starts to weep believing Evelyn is dead,

00:07:03.637 --> 00:07:05.199
then discovers that she is safe

00:07:05.199 --> 00:07:08.025
and hiding&nbsp;in the shower with their new baby boy.

00:07:08.025 --> 00:07:12.129
Marcus, meanwhile, is walking back toward the&nbsp;house when he hears an alien.

00:07:12.129 --> 00:07:14.382
He makes a run for it into the cornfield,

00:07:14.382 --> 00:07:17.920
but runs straight into&nbsp;a tractor wheel, knocking himself unconscious.

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:21.867
Regan has returned home and notices the beam

00:07:21.867 --> 00:07:24.667
of&nbsp;Marcus' flashlight coming out from the cornfield,

00:07:24.667 --> 00:07:27.222
but cannot hear the alien coming up&nbsp;behind her.

00:07:27.222 --> 00:07:29.102
But as the alien moves closer,

00:07:29.102 --> 00:07:31.107
Regan's cochlear implant processor

00:07:31.107 --> 00:07:33.216
starts&nbsp;producing a high-pitched feedback

00:07:33.216 --> 00:07:36.121
which distresses the alien causing it to run off.

00:07:36.121 --> 00:07:39.890
Regan finds&nbsp;Marcus and they retreat to the top of the grain silo.

00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:41.605
Lee has taken Evelyn to the cellar

00:07:41.605 --> 00:07:43.962
and&nbsp;placed his new son into the sound-proof crib.

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:46.309
Evelyn thinks about Beau and regrets

00:07:46.309 --> 00:07:48.475
that&nbsp;she didn't carry him on that fateful day,

00:07:48.475 --> 00:07:50.781
then, before getting some much needed sleep,

00:07:50.781 --> 00:07:53.432
makes&nbsp;Lee promise that he will protect their children.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
Lee leaves to look for the kids as we see water&nbsp;rushing down into the cellar.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.096
Later, Evelyn wakes to find that the cellar has flooded.

00:08:03.096 --> 00:08:06.874
On top of&nbsp;this, an alien has climbed down inside the room,

00:08:06.874 --> 00:08:10.756
and the baby is sleeping in the sound-proof&nbsp;crib but the top is open.

00:08:10.756 --> 00:08:13.244
Evelyn carefully picks up her baby and slinks

00:08:13.244 --> 00:08:16.000
to the back of the&nbsp;cellar behind the waterfall flooding the room.

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:21.803
On top of the silo, Marcus signs, "Don't worry,&nbsp;he'll come for us."

00:08:21.803 --> 00:08:25.210
but Regan shakes her head replying, "He'll come for you."

00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:27.487
All of a sudden a&nbsp;hatch on the top of the silo

00:08:27.487 --> 00:08:30.031
breaks causing Marcus to fall inside of it.

00:08:30.031 --> 00:08:31.924
As he's slowly drowning&nbsp;in the grain,

00:08:31.924 --> 00:08:35.679
the alien in the cellar with Evelyn is drawn out by the noise.

00:08:35.679 --> 00:08:40.530
The hatch breaks away&nbsp;completely and falls into the silo just missing Marcus.

00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:44.671
Regan, herself, jumps into the silo&nbsp;and successfully saves her brother

00:08:44.671 --> 00:08:48.182
by pushing the hatch towards him so he can grab hold of it.

00:08:48.182 --> 00:08:51.205
However, she herself quickly sinks into the grain.

00:08:51.205 --> 00:08:54.700
Marcus climbs onto the hatch and pulls out&nbsp;his sister to safety.

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:58.087
Regan and Marcus both sit safely atop the silo door,

00:08:58.087 --> 00:09:00.774
but then they&nbsp;hear a crash on top of the silo.

00:09:00.774 --> 00:09:03.414
The alien from the flooded cellar jumps in the silo

00:09:03.414 --> 00:09:06.180
as&nbsp;the kids cover themselves with the hatch door.

00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:09.273
They seem doomed until Regan's cochlear&nbsp;implant processor

00:09:09.273 --> 00:09:12.310
once again lets out a piercing feedback forcing the alien

00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:14.240
to crash out the side of the silo.

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:20.842
Regan and Marcus crawl out of the silo and into&nbsp;a pickup truck.

00:09:20.842 --> 00:09:23.263
Lee has arrived on the scene and grabs an axe,

00:09:23.263 --> 00:09:27.175
but is quickly attacked by the alien&nbsp;which causes Marcus to scream.

00:09:27.175 --> 00:09:31.353
Upon hearing this, the alien heads for the truck and starts ripping&nbsp;it open.

00:09:31.353 --> 00:09:34.806
This time when Regan's processor starts its piercing feedback,

00:09:34.806 --> 00:09:36.138
she turns it off.

00:09:36.138 --> 00:09:39.576
Now the&nbsp;alien can safely resume its attack on the truck.

00:09:39.576 --> 00:09:43.879
Lee, who is badly injured, makes eye contact&nbsp;with his daughter and signs,

00:09:43.879 --> 00:09:46.418
"I love you. I have always loved you."

00:09:46.418 --> 00:09:50.400
He then lets out a yell&nbsp;to sacrifice himself and save the kids.

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:52.172
They put the truck into neutral

00:09:52.172 --> 00:09:55.457
and roll it back to the&nbsp;house where they reunite with their mother.

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:00.966
On the last scene of this movie,

00:10:00.966 --> 00:10:03.252
Evelyn and&nbsp;the kids hear the alien approaching,

00:10:03.252 --> 00:10:06.624
so they retreat back into the house and head down to the&nbsp;basement.

00:10:06.624 --> 00:10:08.944
Regan, who was never allowed down there,

00:10:08.944 --> 00:10:13.123
sees for the first time, the evidence of all the&nbsp;work her father put into repairing

00:10:13.123 --> 00:10:15.962
and creating her cochlear implant processor.

00:10:15.962 --> 00:10:19.743
She is overwhelmed&nbsp;with emotion just as the lights begin to flicker.

00:10:19.743 --> 00:10:23.191
The alien walks down into the basement&nbsp;and has them cornered.

00:10:23.191 --> 00:10:27.427
Regan, however, scans a handwritten scribbling from her dad which&nbsp;read,

00:10:27.427 --> 00:10:28.386
"What is their weakness?",

00:10:28.386 --> 00:10:31.823
then takes a quick glance at the hearing aids on his workbench.

00:10:31.823 --> 00:10:32.684
And Eureka...!

00:10:32.684 --> 00:10:36.669
She switches on her cochlear implant processor creating feedback,

00:10:36.669 --> 00:10:38.745
and causing the alien&nbsp;to shudder.

00:10:38.745 --> 00:10:40.783
Regan then amplifies the feedback

00:10:40.783 --> 00:10:43.538
by holding the processor up against a microphone.

00:10:43.538 --> 00:10:46.987
The alien collapses then slowly stagger back up on its feet,

00:10:46.987 --> 00:10:51.159
but Evelyn has grabbed Lee's&nbsp;shotgun and blows its head to pieces.

00:10:51.159 --> 00:10:53.258
When they see on the surveillance monitors

00:10:53.258 --> 00:10:55.050
that&nbsp;this little brouhaha has seemingly

00:10:55.050 --> 00:10:57.507
brought every alien in the county to their home,

00:10:57.507 --> 00:10:59.610
Regan turns&nbsp;up the speakers while Evelyn,

00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:02.237
with a smile, cocks the shotgun.

00:11:03.106 --> 00:11:04.348
Thanks for watching.

00:11:04.348 --> 00:11:06.513
