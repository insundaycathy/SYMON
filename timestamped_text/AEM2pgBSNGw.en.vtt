00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:12.710
In 1947 Portland, Maine, banker Andy Dufresne
is convicted of murdering his wife and her

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:18.110
lover, and is sentenced to two consecutive
life sentences at the Shawshank State Penitentiary.

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:23.829
Andy is befriended by contraband smuggler,
Ellis "Red" Redding, an inmate serving a life

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:25.200
sentence.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:30.300
Red procures a rock hammer and later a large
poster of Rita Hayworth for Andy.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.100
Working in the prison laundry, Andy is regularly
assaulted by "the Sisters" and their leader,

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.100
Bogs.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:41.070
In 1949, Andy overhears the captain of the
guards, Byron Hadley, complaining about being

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.370
taxed on an inheritance, and offers to help
him legally shelter the money.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:51.030
After an assault by the Sisters nearly kills
Andy, Hadley beats Bogs severely.

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.760
Bogs is then transferred to another prison.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.890
Warden Samuel Norton meets Andy and reassigns
him to the prison library to assist elderly

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.620
inmate Brooks Hatlen.

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.080
Andy's new job is a pretext for him to begin
managing financial matters for the prison

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.540
employees.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.479
As time passes, the Warden begins using Andy
to handle matters for a variety of people,

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.010
including guards from other prisons and the
warden himself.

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:20.000
Andy begins writing weekly letters asking
the state government for funds to improve

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.780
the decaying library.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:28.430
In 1954, Brooks is paroled, but cannot adjust
to the outside world after fifty years in

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.210
prison, and commits suicide by hanging himself.

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.450
Andy receives a library donation that includes
a recording of The Marriage of Figaro.

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.530
He plays an excerpt over the public address
system, resulting in him receiving solitary

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.110
confinement.

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.990
After his release from solitary, Andy explains
that hope is what gets him through his time,

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.600
a concept that Red dismisses.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.530
In 1963, Norton begins exploiting prison labor
for public works, profiting by undercutting

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.659
skilled labor costs and receiving bribes.

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:00.530
He has Andy launder the money using the alias
Randall Stephens.

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.320
In 1965, Tommy Williams is incarcerated for
burglary.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.700
He is befriended by Andy and Red, and Andy
helps him pass his GED exam.

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:15.489
In 1966, Tommy reveals to Red and Andy that
an inmate at another prison claimed responsibility

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:18.540
for the murders for which Andy was convicted.

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.969
Andy approaches Norton with this information,
but he refuses to listen and sends Andy back

00:02:22.969 --> 00:02:27.279
to solitary confinement when he mentions the
money laundering.

00:02:27.279 --> 00:02:30.159
Norton has Hadley murder Tommy under the guise
of an escape attempt.

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:31.620
Andy declines to continue the laundering,
but relents after Norton threatens to burn

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:32.620
the library, remove Andy's protection from
the guards, and move him to worse conditions.

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.349
Andy is released from solitary confinement
after two months, and tells Red of his dream

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:39.219
of living in Zihuatanejo, a Mexican coastal
town.

00:02:39.219 --> 00:02:43.719
Red feels Andy is being unrealistic, but promises
Andy that if he is ever released, he will

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:48.489
visit a specific hayfield near Buxton, Maine,
and retrieve a package Andy buried there.

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:53.450
He worries about Andy's well-being, especially
when he learns Andy asked another inmate to

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.139
supply him with six feet (1.8 meters) of rope.

00:02:56.139 --> 00:02:59.499
The next day at roll call, the guards find
Andy's cell empty.

00:02:59.499 --> 00:03:05.540
An irate Norton throws a rock at the poster
of Raquel Welch hanging on the cell wall,

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.689
revealing a tunnel that Andy dug with his
rock hammer over the last 19 years.

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:14.669
The previous night, Andy escaped through the
tunnel and prison sewage pipe, using the rope

00:03:14.669 --> 00:03:19.340
to bring with him Norton's suit, shoes, and
the ledger containing details of the money

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:20.340
laundering.

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.480
While guards search for him, Andy poses as
Randall Stephens and visits several banks

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.370
to withdraw the laundered money, then mails
the ledger and evidence of the corruption

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.849
and murders at Shawshank to a local newspaper.

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:35.659
FBI agents arrive at Shawshank and take Hadley
into custody, while Norton commits suicide

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:37.370
by shooting himself to avoid his arrest.

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:38.799
After serving forty years, Red is finally
paroled.

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:43.260
He struggles to adapt to life outside prison
and fears he never will.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.189
Remembering his promise to Andy, he visits
Buxton and finds a cache containing money

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:50.389
and a letter asking him to come to Zihuatanejo.

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:55.739
Red violates his parole and travels to Fort
Hancock, Texas to cross the border to Mexico,

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:58.129
admitting he finally feels hope.

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:02.560
On a beach in Zihuatanejo he finds Andy, and
the two friends are happily reunited.
