00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.600
Story Recapped here. Today,&nbsp;
I'm going to explain an action,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.920
sci-fi thriller film called "The Colony."&nbsp;
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:12.080
Global warming pushed the climate to the&nbsp;
extremes, causing harsh icy winds and snow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.000
to cover the world. The remaining humans survive&nbsp;
in underground bunkers that shield them from the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.320
rigid environment above. In one of the bunkers,&nbsp;
two people speed through the tunnels, chased&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.640
by an unseen threat. They reach the door at the&nbsp;
end, begging to be let in as danger approaches.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:30.480
Sam, a resident of Colony 7, repairs the&nbsp;
weather machines when he witnesses the soldiers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.320
drag an old, sick man named Hal outside. Hal's&nbsp;
disease is getting worse, and the colony can no&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.720
longer afford to waste resources on him and risk&nbsp;
an outbreak. Even the simple common cold threatens&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.720
the colony, with the last flu outbreak taking&nbsp;
the lives of twenty people in less than a week.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.040
To prevent this, the colony puts anyone showing&nbsp;
symptoms into quarantine. If their conditions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.200
don't improve, they can choose to leave the colony&nbsp;
or take a bullet. Hal chooses to take his chances&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:58.640
on the outside world, but one of the soldiers,&nbsp;
Mason, can't take the risk of Hal returning.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.840
Sam's bargains for Hal's life fall on&nbsp;
deaf ears, and Hal is shot on the back.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.400
When Sam first arrived at Colony 7, hundreds&nbsp;
of residents worked together to maintain life&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.640
underground. They survive the great famine&nbsp;
brought by climate change. Despite the years&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.800
of snow-covered lands, there are still some who&nbsp;
believe paradise exists somewhere above ground.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.880
But other than the cold that freezes the planet,&nbsp;
other humans also threaten the survivors.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.560
Thinking that Mason may also be a threat,&nbsp;
Sam raises his concern to the colony leader,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.600
Briggs. The news that Mason refused to allow&nbsp;
Hal the choice to be exiled worries Briggs,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.080
but more pressing matters must be tended to first.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:35.440
Communications officer Cooper lost contact with&nbsp;
Colony 5 after receiving an S.O.S. from them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.440
Briggs calls in for a general assembly to&nbsp;
discuss the matter and directs Sam to assist the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.400
livestock. Before the assembly, Briggs confronts&nbsp;
Mason on his refusal to honor Hal's choice. But&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.240
Mason insists on preventing the risk of the sick&nbsp;
returning to the colony and endangering the rest.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:54.000
In the livestock section, Viktor explains&nbsp;
that their only female rabbit only gives birth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.440
to stillborns, possibly due to&nbsp;
lack of protein. To address this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.720
Sam asks for soy pellets from his girlfriend,&nbsp;
Kai. As she's gathering the supplies,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.560
Sam notices her laptop showing satellite&nbsp;
footage from Spain. Kai monitors any&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.840
satellite feed she can detect, believing&nbsp;
that someone is still fixing the climate.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.280
At the main hall where the residents gather&nbsp;
for the assembly, Dex reminds his wife, Elena,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:21.120
not to cough. Sam notices their anxious faces&nbsp;
and suggests for them to return to their rooms.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.360
But it's too late; Briggs arrives to start the&nbsp;
meeting. He announces losing communication with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.080
Colony 5 after receiving the distress signal.&nbsp;
Briggs intends to investigate, but Mason argues&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.320
that they don't have the resources to spare.&nbsp;
Briggs, however, is adamant in honoring their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:39.200
pact with Colony 5. He calls on Dex to join&nbsp;
his mission, but Sam volunteers, sparing him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:45.280
from leaving his wife. Viktor's son, Graydon,&nbsp;
also volunteers despite his parents' concerns.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.320
Kai is put in charge of the colony&nbsp;
in Briggs' absence, angering Mason.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.480
The assembly is interrupted when Elena&nbsp;
sneezes and coughs. Fearing the flu,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.800
the rest of the people evacuate the hall, and&nbsp;
Dex and Elena are quarantined. Mason argues&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.640
about quarantine protocols and Kai's authority,&nbsp;
but Briggs reminds him who the colony leader is.

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.280
That evening, Sam wakes up to a nightmare where&nbsp;
he finds his mother frozen to death in the storm.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.880
Years after his mother's death, he&nbsp;
still feels guilty over her demise.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.960
The next day, as the team makes their way to&nbsp;
Colony 5, Sam remembers the start of climate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.880
change. The planet grew hotter at first, and&nbsp;
the world built weather modification towers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.680
to curb climate change. One day, it started to&nbsp;
snow everywhere and hasn't stopped for years.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.120
Garbed in thick coats and gear, the&nbsp;
three men navigate in the icy wasteland,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.960
passing by the ghost of a city that once&nbsp;
buzzed with life. They reach a weather tower,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:33.360
covered in snow and icicles, presumably never&nbsp;
to run again. The three battle their way against&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.360
the harsh environment for hours, hindered by&nbsp;
a broken bridge that groans against the wind.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.800
They carefully navigate around holes in the&nbsp;
concrete and find themselves on a narrow path&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.800
that's on the brink of collapsing. At the end of&nbsp;
the bridge, they spot a dead man leaning against&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.720
an army truck. Briggs picks up a gun from&nbsp;
the man's hand and checks inside the truck,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.800
finding the man's wife and daughter with bullet&nbsp;
holes on their foreheads. The team presses on.

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.520
Walking over thick snow that buries old cities,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:00.000
they reach an abandoned helicopter and take&nbsp;
shelter inside. Briggs radios back to Colony 7,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.160
where Cooper reports Dex and Elena's worsened&nbsp;
conditions. Knowing Mason's brashness,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.880
Briggs gives Cooper authority to use&nbsp;
force should he step out of line.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.840
While they're resting, Briggs brings up how close&nbsp;
they are to where Sam was rescued. Before reaching&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.560
Colony 7, Sam and his family took shelter in&nbsp;
an old mine with other families. Eventually,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.120
their supplies ran out, leaving them to feed on&nbsp;
the horses and dogs. Sam's father brought a team&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.600
out to search for help, but they never returned.&nbsp;
Seeing no hope, Sam took his mother and sister out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.680
of the mine, but the storm separated him from&nbsp;
them. It was the last time he saw his family.

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:34.480
The next day, the team arrives at Colony 5,&nbsp;
seeing it barren with a trail of blood next to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:38.640
a gaping hole on the smokestack. They climb down&nbsp;
the bunker and see more blood on the floor and no&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:43.040
people in sight. Sensing danger, they arm&nbsp;
themselves with guns before moving forward.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.640
The bunker is damp and dark, only their&nbsp;
footsteps and dripping water echoing inside.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:51.280
Briggs sees a dead body covered in a bag in one of&nbsp;
the rooms; blood smeared all over the wall inside.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.640
With no signs of life, Graydon fears that everyone&nbsp;
in the colony is dead. His thoughts are disproved&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:00.640
quickly when they hear knocking from afar. More&nbsp;
bloodstains mark the walls as they reach the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:05.360
battered door where the sound came from. After Sam&nbsp;
picks the lock, Briggs cautiously opens the door,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:10.480
gun in hand. Inside is a man on the floor, covered&nbsp;
in a blanket. Blinded by the lights they carry,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:14.880
the man panics and waves a metal rod to drive&nbsp;
them away. Outnumbered, he holds up his hand in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:19.440
surrender, begging for his life. As he realizes&nbsp;
that they're not the ones he fears, the man warns&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:25.520
them to lock the doors. The man, Leland, eats&nbsp;
and drinks Sam's supplies as he tells his story.

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.840
After fixing a new antenna, Colony 5 reached&nbsp;
transmission farther than they had before.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:33.440
One transmission shows a man who claims to&nbsp;
have modified a weather tower and successfully&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.440
thawed an area stretching to a three-mile&nbsp;
radius. Before the man shares his location,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:41.680
the transmission cuts off. Colony 5 sent a&nbsp;
team to locate the source, but they failed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.680
Instead, another group found their team&nbsp;
and followed them back to the colony.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.880
Leland fears whoever is out there, choosing&nbsp;
to be imprisoned in the room than to take&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:52.640
his chances outside. Sam assures him that&nbsp;
no one else is in the bunker, and they only&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:56.720
found him due to his knocking. But Leland&nbsp;
didn't do it. Someone else is in the bunker.

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:01.440
Confident that they can return home, Briggs&nbsp;
orders his team to prepare to leave. Graydon&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:06.080
calls Colony 7 for updates while Sam and Briggs&nbsp;
search the room for resources. Leland continues to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:10.720
weep in the dark, frightened of what lies ahead.&nbsp;
After several attempts, Graydon's radio fails to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:15.440
contact Colony 7 as they're too far underground&nbsp;
to reach a signal. Before they leave, voices roar&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:20.240
from afar. More sounds of activity echo in the&nbsp;
bunker. Briggs' team leaves the room, but Leland&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:25.120
pushes Graydon out and locks himself back inside.&nbsp;
With no choice, they abandon Leland and move on.

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:29.280
Carefully, the team follows the sounds of choked&nbsp;
screams and thumps. They hear the sound of metal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:33.040
chains, discovering a room filled with severed&nbsp;
human limbs carved out by the cannibal group that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:37.840
infiltrated Colony 5. Among the bloody carcass,&nbsp;
a hand moves, its owner clinging to life in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:43.120
mess. The butcher stops and notices the team.&nbsp;
He aims to attack until Sam shoots him down.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:46.880
The gunshot alerts the other cannibals,&nbsp;
who awaken and chase after the team.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:50.240
Briggs lights a stick of dynamite and&nbsp;
blows up the group chasing after them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:53.680
Having run ahead of them, Graydon is&nbsp;
separated from the two and gets ambushed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.560
The cannibals stab him repeatedly&nbsp;
before Sam and Briggs come to his aid.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:01.120
Sam shoots the men down but is tackled by&nbsp;
another, who pins him down. Briggs fights&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:05.760
off another cannibal with an ice ax and pulls off&nbsp;
the man trapping Sam. He swings his ice ax at them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:10.000
until all their assailants are dead. The two check&nbsp;
on Graydon, but he has succumbed to his wounds.

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:14.720
Hearing a war cry from afar, Briggs and Sam run&nbsp;
back to the smokestack where they climbed in from.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:19.440
Sam shoots at the cannibals, but he runs out&nbsp;
of bullets. While Sam climbs up the ladder,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:22.880
Briggs breaks down the lower ladder to&nbsp;
prevent their pursuers from coming after them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:26.400
He gets attacked by another man and gets&nbsp;
beaten before he could reach his gun and shoot.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:28.240
The rest of the cannibals find Briggs staring up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:31.840
at him in a fury. The leader lets out an&nbsp;
angered roar as he watches them escape.

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:36.560
Reaching the ground above, Briggs lights&nbsp;
dynamite and throws it back inside the bunker.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:41.040
The smokestack explodes and collapses in itself.&nbsp;
Believing the cannibals are trapped underground,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:42.560
Briggs and Sam make their way back home.

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:46.960
The two take shelter back in the helicopter,&nbsp;
where they discuss the recent events.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:51.600
Before global warming, Briggs was an Army captain&nbsp;
on a relief effort. He witnessed how people go&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:56.160
feral out of desperation, akin to how the people&nbsp;
who destroyed Colony 5 turned to cannibalism.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.160 --> 00:08:00.000
Twenty thousand people gathered in the stadium to&nbsp;
receive food and medicine from the relief effort.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.600
But when supplies ran out, armed people stole&nbsp;
the supplies from those who couldn't defend&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:07.440
themselves. When the supplies were still not&nbsp;
enough, the armed people gathered others for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:11.200
execution, trimming down the population&nbsp;
enough to feed those left alive. Briggs'&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:15.360
squad attempted to stop the chaos, but they&nbsp;
were powerless. Hoping for a better future,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:18.240
Briggs and Sam agree to search for the&nbsp;
location where the land has been thawed.

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:23.040
In the morning, Sam spots the cannibal group&nbsp;
that followed their footprints. Upon reaching the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:27.360
bridge, Briggs and Sam jump over the massive hole&nbsp;
in the middle, shaking the bridge momentarily.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:31.280
With the cannibals near, Briggs lights a stick&nbsp;
of dynamite, but the wind blows out the fuse.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:35.200
Sam stops Briggs from going back to it, but&nbsp;
he knocks Sam down, fighting to start a fire&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:40.160
as the cannibals get near. He finally lights the&nbsp;
dynamite but doesn't throw it. Instead, he battles&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:43.840
with the cannibals until the dynamite triggers in&nbsp;
his hand, blowing up the bridge between Sam and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:48.480
the surviving cannibals. With the bridge broken,&nbsp;
the leader snarls at Sam as he gets up and leaves.

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:54.560
Now alone, Sam heads back to Colony 7. Freezing,&nbsp;
distraught, and exhausted, he finally reaches the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:59.120
colony where Mason executes Elena in front of Dex&nbsp;
without testing her for the disease first. Kai&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:03.840
emerges, raising her gun at Mason. Tired of the&nbsp;
flawed protocols, Mason declares his intentions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:07.680
on changing things for their survival. Their&nbsp;
confrontation ends when they hear Sam's call for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:12.800
help. The distraction allows Dex to escape. Kai&nbsp;
runs to Sam but is knocked unconscious by Mason.

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:18.000
Later that day, Sam wakes up surrounded by the&nbsp;
colony. Viktor asks for his son and weeps when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.760
Sam confirms that Graydon and Briggs are&nbsp;
dead. Mason arrives, cuffing Sam to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:26.320
bed. He declares his rules, cutting everyone's&nbsp;
rations in half and imposing tests on anyone who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:31.040
shows sickness symptoms. Sam warns them about the&nbsp;
cannibals who slaughtered everyone in Colony 5.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:35.440
He asks Mason to evacuate everyone to the thawed&nbsp;
land, assuring them that he knows the location.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:39.520
But Mason doesn't believe him. When the&nbsp;
rest is gone, a little boy named Rowan&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:42.800
gives Sam the stolen key to his handcuffs.

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:46.720
Outside, Viktor and Mason check for signs of&nbsp;
the cannibals. They check the surveillance&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:51.280
monitors but don't find anything. A man reports&nbsp;
Sam's escape, and Mason heads off to find him.

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:55.680
After getting free, Sam rescues Kai and shows&nbsp;
her the thawed land from the satellite images&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:59.600
on her computer. Confirming the land's&nbsp;
location, Sam gathers their supply of seeds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:04.080
and rushes to get as many people as they can to&nbsp;
evacuate the colony. Mason blocks their path,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:08.640
asserting his authority over them. Loud thumps&nbsp;
overhead alarm the group, ending the argument.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:12.480
They rush back to the surveillance monitors&nbsp;
and see the cannibals prying open their doors.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:15.600
The leader presents Dex's severed head&nbsp;
to the camera before breaking the device.

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:19.360
Realizing that Sam had been telling&nbsp;
the truth, Mason orders everyone to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:22.560
arm themselves while the rest who can't&nbsp;
fight are secured in the vault. Cooper&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:26.160
assists the women and children to the vault,&nbsp;
prepared to fight if the cannibals reach them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:30.400
At the entrance, the non-disabled survivors&nbsp;
prepare for battle. The lights start to flicker&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:34.240
as the cannibals find other ways to infiltrate&nbsp;
the bunker. Cooper fights off a cannibal from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:38.800
the vault but is overpowered. The women lock the&nbsp;
vault, preventing the attacker from reaching them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:43.280
Another cannibal corners a woman at their church.&nbsp;
Her screams echo all around, alarming the others.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.320
The cannibals enter from the vents, stabbing&nbsp;
Mason in the stomach. As more cannibals arrive,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:53.280
the injured Mason flees with fear in his eyes. Kai&nbsp;
and Sam back away as they get outnumbered. Viktor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:58.000
stays, refusing to back down from the people who&nbsp;
killed his son. After a valiant battle, Viktor is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.320
sliced across the stomach, defeated by the leader.&nbsp;
Mason reaches the main hall and immediately&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:06.400
barricades the door, preventing Sam and Kai&nbsp;
from entering. A woman knocks Mason out and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:11.600
opens the door just as a cannibal tackles Sam. Kai&nbsp;
shoots the cannibal on the back, saving him. More&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:15.680
cannibals rush to the door, but Mason barricades&nbsp;
it again before they could reach them. With the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:20.320
cannibals breaking the door, Sam pries the vents&nbsp;
open to escape to the surface. Mason refuses to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:24.000
go, believing that they could still fight the&nbsp;
cannibals. The rest of the survivors follow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.960
Sam instead, leaving Mason to fight by himself.&nbsp;
Before he leaves, Sam tosses his gun to Mason,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:33.200
who aims it back at him. Sam reminds him that he'd&nbsp;
need all the bullets to fight before disappearing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:38.640
into the vent. With no one on his side, Mason&nbsp;
faces the cannibals. As his final action, Mason&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:43.040
shoots a nearby gas tank, filling the main hall&nbsp;
with flames that burn him and the cannibals alive.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:47.040
The cannibal leader jumps into the vent before&nbsp;
the flames erupt, allowing him to chase after Sam.

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:51.520
Inside the cramped vent, Sam dives forward,&nbsp;
blocking the cannibal leader from the rest.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:55.520
The leader throws Sam to the side, causing the&nbsp;
vent to break open, spilling them into the burning&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:55.520 --> 00:12:00.160
livestock room. Sam uses numerous cages to fend&nbsp;
off the man, but he is grabbed and thrown down.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:04.720
Weakened, Sam is knocked to the ground, then on a&nbsp;
table where the leader slams his fist against his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:09.440
chest. Baring his sharpened teeth, the leader&nbsp;
tells Sam he wants more. Sam finds a broken&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:13.680
metal sheet as he's dragged down and drives it&nbsp;
into the man's leg. With him down, Sam grabs a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:17.920
pipe and releases all his anger and fear on the&nbsp;
cannibal's head, feeling the fury take him over.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:22.480
Seeing the man unmoving, Sam turns his back but&nbsp;
is grabbed on the leg. Sam drives a blade into the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:26.320
cannibal's mouth, pushing down until he breaks&nbsp;
his head in half, finally ending the battle.

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:30.080
Outside, the remaining survivor&nbsp;
watches their home enveloped in smoke.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:34.640
Sam finally joins them, seeing the confusion&nbsp;
and misery in the others' faces. Sam leads&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:38.400
the survivors to the thawed area with his purpose&nbsp;
set, carrying the seeds to start their paradise.
