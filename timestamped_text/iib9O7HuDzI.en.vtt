00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:07.996
hey what's up guys

00:00:08.044 --> 00:00:12.268
today I'll show you an anthology horror film: "The Mortuary Collection"

00:00:12.364 --> 00:00:15.052
hormones ahead, watch out and take care

00:00:15.292 --> 00:00:19.132
the old man is the undertaker of the Raven's End Mortuary

00:00:19.228 --> 00:00:21.340
one day, after concluding a funeral

00:00:21.388 --> 00:00:25.468
he finds a young girl, Sam, waiting for him in the mortuary's foyer

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.836
Sam says she saw the job posting out front and wants to apply for the job

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.444
hearing that, the undertaker gives her a creepy smile and takes her to his office

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.268
seeing the house is full of books

00:00:36.316 --> 00:00:39.628
Sam is so curious that she asks what the books are used for

00:00:39.676 --> 00:00:44.188
he says those are all stories detailing how his deceased customers died and why

00:00:44.284 --> 00:00:46.348
which arouses Sam's interest

00:00:46.444 --> 00:00:48.844
then, she asks him to share a story

00:00:48.892 --> 00:00:54.172
without any delay, he tells a fun story taking place in the 1950s

00:00:54.268 --> 00:00:57.628
there was a girl named Beauty who loved to attend parties

00:00:57.724 --> 00:01:02.860
since she was a thief however, she was not there to hunt guys' hormones but their wallets

00:01:02.908 --> 00:01:07.756
at a party, while Beauty stayed in the restroom to examine the stuff she had stolen

00:01:07.852 --> 00:01:10.492
she was attracted by the medicine cabinet there

00:01:10.588 --> 00:01:12.700
she tried to open it but found it locked

00:01:12.748 --> 00:01:16.348
so that she couldn't help but take out a little knife to bust the lock

00:01:16.396 --> 00:01:19.516
unlike usual, it took quite a while for her to open it

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.972
and her finger got cut with blood dripping on the basin

00:01:23.068 --> 00:01:25.420
without taking a look into the cabinet first

00:01:25.516 --> 00:01:28.204
she went find the paper towel to stop the bleeding

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.268
when the cabinet's door banged shut

00:01:30.364 --> 00:01:31.468
she found it weird

00:01:31.564 --> 00:01:33.820
but didn't take that as a warning of danger

00:01:33.916 --> 00:01:36.556
she tries to open it again at her full strength

00:01:36.652 --> 00:01:42.124
finally, she did open the door but only to discover an octopus-like monster living inside

00:01:42.268 --> 00:01:45.340
she screamed out loud and immediately closed it

00:01:45.436 --> 00:01:49.372
she managed to press the door shut until the monster got quiet inside

00:01:49.468 --> 00:01:52.252
then, she tried to walk out of the bathroom gently

00:01:52.348 --> 00:01:55.324
but the stolen pocket watch suddenly fell onto the ground

00:01:55.468 --> 00:01:57.868
the sound disturbed the monster once again

00:01:58.012 --> 00:02:01.501
as a result, it stretched out its tentacles to catch Beauty

00:02:01.501 --> 00:02:03.292
and dragged her to the cabinet

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.122
since the cabinet was too small

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.338
the monster broke her back to squeeze her inside

00:02:08.434 --> 00:02:13.042
as the cabinet door closed, it got back to normal inside the restroom

00:02:13.282 --> 00:02:16.018
upon hearing this story, Sam says it is childish

00:02:16.066 --> 00:02:19.234
and asks the old man to tell one a bit more creepy

00:02:19.378 --> 00:02:24.178
irritated by her words, the old man says he has a full truckload of stories to tell

00:02:24.226 --> 00:02:27.394
and asks Sam to sign the employment contract first

00:02:27.538 --> 00:02:32.242
seeing she signs it without any hesitation, he gives a creepy smile once again

00:02:32.338 --> 00:02:34.642
then, while he shows her around the house

00:02:34.738 --> 00:02:36.610
he begins the second story

00:02:36.802 --> 00:02:41.746
once on campus, HormoneSmith was busy preaching to his fangirls about equality doctrine

00:02:41.794 --> 00:02:45.826
and stressed its exact meaning that women were entitled to hormone freedom

00:02:45.874 --> 00:02:48.754
as long as they did it with a hormone bag for protection

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.498
funny enough, he quoted Karl Marx to help persuade the girls

00:02:52.594 --> 00:02:55.474
while passing out those free and cheap hormone bags

00:02:55.522 --> 00:02:58.546
he invited those horny girls to a party that night

00:02:58.642 --> 00:03:02.674
on the way back, he met a four-eyed girl and invited her to the party

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.890
to his great surprise, she immediately agreed to come

00:03:05.938 --> 00:03:09.154
that night, HormoneSmith couldn't take his eyes off the pretty girl

00:03:09.298 --> 00:03:11.986
who dressed up sexy without her two glassy eyes on

00:03:12.034 --> 00:03:15.874
driven by the hormone effect, HormoneSmith took her to a room

00:03:15.922 --> 00:03:19.378
right there, they flirted and ready for a hormone rocket

00:03:19.426 --> 00:03:23.506
but before she was stripped off naked, she suddenly asked if he was scared

00:03:23.602 --> 00:03:26.386
as a few nasty guys had been found missing recently

00:03:26.482 --> 00:03:30.322
and he barely knew her, and what if she was the serial killer

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.306
however, what HormoneSmith wanted for now, was to get laid

00:03:34.402 --> 00:03:37.378
and therefore, he went to bed with her at rocket speed

00:03:37.426 --> 00:03:40.354
however, when HormoneSmith woke up the next morning

00:03:40.594 --> 00:03:43.858
the pretty girl had gone and left her number on the mirror

00:03:44.002 --> 00:03:47.362
but he didn't plan to contact her again and erased the number

00:03:47.458 --> 00:03:52.642
unluckily, he found he got an itchy rash, which undoubtedly, the pretty girl gave him

00:03:52.738 --> 00:03:53.986
he regretted it a lot

00:03:54.034 --> 00:03:58.738
for he couldn't even get time to wear a hormone bag last night due to his rocket fast

00:03:58.786 --> 00:04:01.474
in the hospital, while checking on HormoneSmith

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.402
the doctor heard some weird heartbeats inside his body

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.082
he got panicked and ran away

00:04:06.178 --> 00:04:10.210
frightened by the doctor's reaction, HormoneSmith took a look at his labs

00:04:10.258 --> 00:04:12.610
and found out he was pregnant with a baby

00:04:12.658 --> 00:04:14.866
seeing his belly had become really bigger

00:04:14.962 --> 00:04:16.450
he tried to call the pretty girl

00:04:16.546 --> 00:04:19.282
and it's lucky her number was incompletely wiped out

00:04:19.474 --> 00:04:23.122
then, he managed to get her address and rushed to meet her

00:04:23.218 --> 00:04:25.522
however, his brothers suddenly showed up

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:28.834
and were ready to give him a surprise congratulation ritual

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.770
because after his successfully sleeping sixty-seven innocent girls

00:04:32.818 --> 00:04:35.794
he's the right fit for the HormoneSmith right now

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:39.586
when they got him onto a chair and bounced it up and down

00:04:39.634 --> 00:04:43.810
it's embarrassing that his womb broke, and the water flooded all over

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:47.650
later, HormoneSmith arrived at the pretty girl's house

00:04:47.698 --> 00:04:49.954
her mother was not shocked to see him at all

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.642
but expertly prepared him for baby delivery

00:04:52.786 --> 00:04:56.098
the pretty girl was angry to see HormoneSmith had become pregnant

00:04:56.146 --> 00:04:58.642
and blamed him for not wearing any hormone bag

00:04:58.786 --> 00:05:03.394
regardless of his pain of childbirth, she even flirted with her honey over the phone

00:05:03.538 --> 00:05:08.482
HormoneSmith was so painful that he asked how a man should give birth to a baby

00:05:08.578 --> 00:05:11.314
then, the mother told him that it's just like a woman

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:14.290
and the baby would come out in the same way it came in

00:05:14.482 --> 00:05:18.226
later, HormoneSmith had a baby but died of difficult labor

00:05:18.274 --> 00:05:21.298
and the mother took the baby to a room upstairs

00:05:21.346 --> 00:05:25.234
when she accidentally stepped on a toy duck there to make some noises

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:26.914
many babies started to cry

00:05:26.962 --> 00:05:29.890
the room turned out to be filled with newborn babies

00:05:29.938 --> 00:05:34.402
showing that HormoneSmith bumped into the HormoneQueen, unfortunately

00:05:34.498 --> 00:05:37.810
after the second story, Sam smiles with satisfaction

00:05:37.858 --> 00:05:41.458
and says she likes it since it is very educational and ironic

00:05:41.506 --> 00:05:44.098
the undertaker is encouraged by her compliments

00:05:44.194 --> 00:05:47.410
and therefore, he goes into a third story right away

00:05:47.746 --> 00:05:52.642
once right in the wedding ceremony, Wendell's beloved wife had a severe attack of illness

00:05:52.738 --> 00:05:55.138
and since then, she became a vegetable

00:05:55.282 --> 00:05:59.890
unwilling to break their vow "until death do us part" cut on the wedding rings

00:05:59.938 --> 00:06:01.906
he looked after her with great care

00:06:02.002 --> 00:06:06.226
however, as the days went by, this kind of life exhausted the poor man

00:06:06.274 --> 00:06:09.826
particularly while seeing his wife's condition didn't get any improving

00:06:09.922 --> 00:06:11.602
and the bills were piling up

00:06:11.698 --> 00:06:13.762
he fell into huge despair

00:06:13.858 --> 00:06:18.082
his family doctor sympathized with Wendell and decided to do him a favor

00:06:18.178 --> 00:06:21.346
one day, the doctor gave him a bottle of painkillers

00:06:21.442 --> 00:06:26.578
and implied that if a patient overdosed on it, he would die a quiet and easy death

00:06:26.626 --> 00:06:29.986
that night, Wendell had them both dress up for dinner

00:06:30.034 --> 00:06:32.386
while he said she was so beautiful tonight

00:06:32.482 --> 00:06:35.650
and took out the statuette of a rabbit so beloved by her

00:06:35.698 --> 00:06:37.762
but she was still unresponsive

00:06:37.858 --> 00:06:40.546
he felt it's cruel and burst into sobbing

00:06:40.642 --> 00:06:42.706
but wanted to have a last shot at it

00:06:42.802 --> 00:06:46.594
holding her hand and begging her to give him a blink or shed a tear

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:48.274
seeing she still didn't respond

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:51.825
he finally built up the courage to put the ground-up pills in the porridge

00:06:51.825 --> 00:06:53.074
and fed it to her

00:06:53.362 --> 00:06:55.906
he loved her so much that he couldn't help crying

00:06:55.954 --> 00:06:58.258
but thought it was better for both of them this way

00:06:58.354 --> 00:07:02.338
yet after the porridge eaten up, he was happy to see she grabbed his arm

00:07:02.434 --> 00:07:04.978
and he rushed to make her cough up the porridge

00:07:05.026 --> 00:07:06.514
while he turned around

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:10.498
she fell forward and impaled her head on the pointed statuette

00:07:10.738 --> 00:07:14.725
seeing the blood spreading the table, he realized he accidentally killed her

00:07:15.058 --> 00:07:17.842
then, he planned to put the dead body into a trunk

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:20.338
and disposed of it without being caught

00:07:20.386 --> 00:07:25.625
when finding the trunk was too small, he had an evil thought which was to dismember her

00:07:25.625 --> 00:07:28.600
while the saw just touched her thigh, she suddenly screamed

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:32.996
which scared him, causing him to pull out the pointed statuette hastily

00:07:33.044 --> 00:07:37.316
after that, he began dismembering her and packed all the limbs into the trunk

00:07:37.412 --> 00:07:40.436
Wendell carried the heavy trunk into the elevator

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:43.268
when his neighbor was gonna take the elevator with him

00:07:43.316 --> 00:07:45.764
Wendell frantically pushed the close button

00:07:45.812 --> 00:07:49.316
and didn't care the neighbor's hand almost got hurt by the closing door

00:07:49.364 --> 00:07:53.060
although he got rid of the neighbor, the elevator suddenly got stuck

00:07:53.204 --> 00:07:55.460
then, he tried to open it with bare hands

00:07:55.508 --> 00:07:57.812
and saw another neighbor standing right there

00:07:57.908 --> 00:08:01.028
knowing she went to call the police, Wendell was scared

00:08:01.076 --> 00:08:05.348
and used his jacket to wipe the floor covered with blood but only to get it worse

00:08:05.444 --> 00:08:08.660
looking at the mess, he wanted to escape through the lift shaft

00:08:08.708 --> 00:08:10.100
but fell on the floor

00:08:10.148 --> 00:08:13.892
sitting right there, he broke down and took off the wedding ring to throw away

00:08:13.988 --> 00:08:18.452
and said that he was not supposed to meet her, otherwise, all this wouldn't happen

00:08:18.692 --> 00:08:23.780
suddenly, the elevator went down rapidly and lots of good memories came flashing back

00:08:23.876 --> 00:08:27.428
while immersing himself in the memories, he smiled happily

00:08:27.524 --> 00:08:31.076
right then, the wife's body rose from the trunk in one piece

00:08:31.268 --> 00:08:33.620
to his surprise, she wasn't revenged on him

00:08:33.764 --> 00:08:37.268
preferring instead to place the wedding ring back on his finger

00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:40.484
this was their love story of "till death do us part"

00:08:40.628 --> 00:08:44.612
later, the police arrived and only found Wendell had gone insane

00:08:44.804 --> 00:08:48.164
that's all for the third story, which Sam doesn't get grabbed by

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:51.620
since it's about the same theme of Karma as the previous two

00:08:51.716 --> 00:08:55.076
Sam thinks in real life, the bad guy wins very often

00:08:55.124 --> 00:08:57.332
and tells her own story to prove that

00:08:57.812 --> 00:09:00.356
not long ago, Sam was a babysitter

00:09:00.404 --> 00:09:04.125
one night, while the little boy went to sleep, she made herself a meal

00:09:04.292 --> 00:09:06.788
and saw the news that a psychopath just escaped

00:09:06.884 --> 00:09:10.196
when a riot broke out at a local lunatic asylum

00:09:10.244 --> 00:09:14.084
at last, the police reminded residents that they should take special care

00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:15.716
and stayed inside

00:09:15.764 --> 00:09:19.124
Sam didn't take the news seriously and continued cooking

00:09:19.172 --> 00:09:22.964
soon, she was shocked to see an intruder turn up at the house

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:27.908
seeing the man's injured head covered in blood, she was sure he's the exact psychopath

00:09:28.052 --> 00:09:32.660
she kept calm and friendly, asked him why he got hurt and brought some food to him

00:09:32.852 --> 00:09:36.308
unluckily, the little boy's mother called and nervously said by phone

00:09:36.404 --> 00:09:40.196
what the news reported about the psychopath known for targeting children

00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:43.508
Sam noticed the intruder's face changed upon hearing that

00:09:43.604 --> 00:09:46.340
and therefore grabbed the soup ladle to hit him

00:09:46.436 --> 00:09:48.980
then, they had a life-and-death struggle

00:09:49.076 --> 00:09:51.188
when he tried to choke her with bare hands

00:09:51.236 --> 00:09:54.308
Sam said very strangely that he was not the killer

00:09:54.404 --> 00:09:58.532
hearing that, the intruder paused and recalled that he didn't kill anyone

00:09:58.676 --> 00:10:01.268
Sam just took the chance to shove him down the stairs

00:10:01.316 --> 00:10:04.004
and then threw the TV at his head at her full strength

00:10:04.052 --> 00:10:07.220
later, the parents got home and found the dead intruder

00:10:07.268 --> 00:10:09.476
whose face had been badly mutilated

00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:13.652
however, they couldn't find the boy and Sam until they opened the oven door

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:17.300
when hearing a loud 'ding', they found the baked little boy in the oven

00:10:17.444 --> 00:10:19.268
it's revealed that Sam did it

00:10:19.316 --> 00:10:23.396
actually, Sam is the true serial killer known for targeting children

00:10:23.444 --> 00:10:26.036
and enjoys collecting the victim's teeth

00:10:26.132 --> 00:10:29.780
as Sam finishes her story, she opens the little boy's coffin

00:10:29.876 --> 00:10:31.892
and expertly pulls out his tooth

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:36.212
which she forgot as she left hastily after killing the intruder that time

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:41.348
meanwhile, the undertaker is stunned and fails to escape when Sam stabs him

00:10:41.396 --> 00:10:45.332
in order to keep her story a secret, she has to kill the old man

00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:49.604
however, the undertaker laughs out loud and reveals he is immortal

00:10:49.652 --> 00:10:52.964
saying that the contract she signed has taken effect

00:10:53.012 --> 00:10:55.988
which means she will take his place as the mortician

00:10:56.132 --> 00:10:59.725
by the time she tries to leave the house, she discovers that she can't

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.175
as she has been trapped by the mortuary's mysterious power

00:11:03.428 --> 00:11:07.604
in the library, the old man says she needs to pay for what she's done

00:11:07.604 --> 00:11:09.428
before taking the new job

00:11:09.524 --> 00:11:15.092
then, he uses his walking stick to tap the floor, causing books to fall onto the floor

00:11:15.188 --> 00:11:18.740
and the ghosts of her victims begin walking out from the books

00:11:18.932 --> 00:11:21.812
they want their revenge, and thus tear her into pieces

00:11:22.436 --> 00:11:26.804
after taking back their teeth from Sam, they finally rest in peace

00:11:26.996 --> 00:11:31.460
then, the undertaker splices the pieces of Sam's body together until dawn

00:11:31.556 --> 00:11:34.676
and at last, he's freed from the curse as an atonement

00:11:34.724 --> 00:11:39.668
with all done, he walks out of the mortuary and turns to dust immediately

00:11:39.764 --> 00:11:41.828
as a sinner and the new mortician

00:11:41.924 --> 00:11:46.148
Sam will be stuck in the mortuary until she atones for all her crimes

00:11:47.204 --> 00:11:50.180
