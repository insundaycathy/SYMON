00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.950
If you mistakenly chose to be nice to the
weird kid in school, then, after you ignored

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:42.470
some of their messages, they committed ritualistic
suicide so they could possess and murder your

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:45.210
friends and family so you could experience
their loneliness, what could you do?

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.431
In this video on Nerd Explains, I'll tell
you how to beat the Computer Witch, in, Friend

00:00:50.431 --> 00:00:51.431
Request.

00:00:51.431 --> 00:00:54.800
Let’s say we are Laura in the beginning
of the movie.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.260
We don’t have perfect knowledge and we don’t
know how this ends, all we know is what the

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:00.640
characters know.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.440
Can we beat this situation?

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.050
Let’s find out.

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:09.630
We start out as a popular, good-looking college
girl, with so many friends, so many, just

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.729
look at the facebook friend counter.

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:17.430
When grabbing lunch between classes, we glance
over and see a weird loner girl checking us

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.720
out from across the cafeteria.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.040
Apparently she is in our psych class as well.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.030
Later that night, she sends us a friend request
saying she’s from our psych class and hopes

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:29.470
we can be friends, with a smiley face.

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.440
This is the first important decision we need
to make.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.740
I’d say denying her friend request is perfectly
justified.

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.090
Let me explain why.

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:43.250
We take a look at her profile and she has
zero friends, zero.

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:48.060
Every picture is put through a black and white
filter, and all her posts and images are really

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.369
dark and goth.

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:54.420
It’s abundantly clear we have literally
nothing in common with this girl.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.000
The fact that she immediately wants to be
friends when she doesn’t even know us is

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.479
a bit concerning.

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.550
We haven’t hung out, participated in a study
group, or said anything to each other.

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.420
The only interaction we’ve had is seeing
her creepily check us out from across the

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.729
cafeteria.

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.700
There is nothing that should give us any reason
to become friends all the sudden.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.900
I mean, I know this is college and people
are more willing to branch out and make friends

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.930
with strangers, but still, it’s strange.

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.700
Her animations and artwork are really good.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.121
Considering the timeline, she’s completing
these and posting these like every day, which

00:02:29.121 --> 00:02:31.560
would require a ton of skill.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.360
This chick is talented.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.250
Which means it’s even weirder that she has
zero friends.

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.889
How can someone with that talent and pronounced
set of beliefs not find a friend.

00:02:41.889 --> 00:02:46.449
I’m sure plenty of people would be interested
in either talking with her about her sulky

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:49.610
shit, or hiring her for her artistic abilities.

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.800
This isn’t Salem where there’s twenty
uptight dicks in a medieval village.

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.970
It’s 2016 with the internet.

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:01.360
You can be the strangest, most fringe lunatic
imaginable and still find friends.

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.500
I don’t think it’s possible to not find
one decent, actual friend in the 4 billion

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.609
active internet users or 8 billion people
on this planet.

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:15.040
For christ’s sake there are entire groups
of people that dress up in animal suits and

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.230
fuck each other, and you can’t find one
friend, really?

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:24.570
She should have at least some friends, unless
ya know, there’s something horribly wrong

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:25.840
with her.

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.940
Maybe she wants a real life friend that models
what she considers to be the perfect life,

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.820
as an escape from her own deficiencies.

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:38.220
Maybe like Laura said, she’s just new and
started her Facebook profile.

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.120
Okay, but that’s super easy to check.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.540
Facebook literally tells you when she created
her profile, not to mention you can scroll

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.010
her newsfeed or images to quickly see the
first post they made.

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.340
Considering she has zero friends, I’d check
to see if it was a new profile.

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:55.340
If it wasn’t new, that’s even weirder.

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:56.340
In the movie, Laura doesn’t click on her
images, which is the most laughable, unlikely

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:57.340
mistake.

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:58.340
A college girl who's obsessed with social
media doesn’t check out the images section

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:59.340
of someone’s Facebook profile, right.

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:00.340
If we did check this creepy girl's images
to see when her first post was, or just to

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:01.340
generally find out more about her, we’d
probably find more creepy shit.

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:02.340
And who on Earth accepts a friend request
from someone like this without some extra

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:03.340
investigation.

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.760
I’d definitely at least Google her to see
if she shows up on Murderpedia or something.

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:12.440
She’s not using her real name, Ma Rina,
which is odd as well.

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.760
There is literally no online information about
this creepy girl who wants to be our friend

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.000
out of the blue.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.370
Red flags are popping up everywhere.

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:25.010
Marina also has trichotillomania, which is
a mental illness.

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:30.000
But, combined with everything else we know
about her, it’s most likely a form of self-harm

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.120
to seek relief from emotional distress, not
some advanced OCD.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:40.380
It should be pretty obvious that she’s damaged,
probably suicidal, and obviously is lonely

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:44.060
and looking for someone to emotionally attach
and cling to.

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.950
If we continued to scroll her homepage a bit
we’d see her interests section.

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:53.220
In the movie they just scroll past this section
and think nothing of it.

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:58.121
Her interests section consists of some passable
stuff that a goth girl might be into, like

00:04:58.121 --> 00:05:00.150
dark woods and magick.

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:05.430
The spelling of magick is interesting though,
as the k at the end is used to differentiate

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:10.530
it as occult magick, not some David Blaine
shit.

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:17.100
That’s a bit weird.

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:22.210
Hymenopterology, which is the study of wasps,
is also out of place.

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:27.900
So she’s just randomly interested in wasps,
nothing about this girl is normal.

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:32.980
If we type Magick and wasps into Google, the
results are about witchcraft.

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:36.580
There’s also a top interest on Scrying.

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:41.510
Scrying is some witchcraft that has to do
with portals to other realms or something.

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:45.440
Even though I don’t believe in witchcraft,
I'm still going to avoid people who do.

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:50.230
Oh, and how could I forget the disturbing
ass two-faced baby with the letters SRA.

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:56.840
A quick googling on this as well reveals that
SRA stands for Satanic Ritualistic Abuse.

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:57.840
What.

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:58.840
the.

00:05:58.840 --> 00:05:59.840
Fuck.

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:00.840
Dark woods?

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:01.840
Okay.

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:02.840
Wasps?

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:03.840
Weird, but okay.

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:04.840
Scrying?

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:07.760
Obsessions of witchcraft are disconcerting
for sure.

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.930
Satanic Ritualistic Abuse?

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:11.640
Nope, fuck that shit.

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:15.940
I’m not accepting your friend request or
hanging out with you, ever.

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:22.060
With some common sense Facebook stalkage,
we’d 100% end up denying her friend request.

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:25.750
Simply avoiding adding her as a friend and
nipping this whole thing in the bud would

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:30.110
quite possibly stop all the future tragedies
from occurring as they did.

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:34.710
Now, there’s a chance that she’d fixate
on us and continue pressing us to be friends.

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:37.230
How should we handle this?

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:40.190
We need to ignore all her online messages.

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:45.000
If she confronts us in person asking if we
want to be friends, we’ll politely but firmly

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.010
decline.

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:50.560
If she doesn’t give up after we declined
all her previous advances, it’s pretty clear

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:52.790
we have a stalker on our hands.

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:57.460
According to Google, one of the most important
things to do at this point is to not engage

00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:59.090
them at all.

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:04.230
Stalkers will typically misconstrue any contact
or interaction as validation of a relationship

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:05.389
between us.

00:07:05.389 --> 00:07:10.030
We don’t want to make threats or jump straight
into obtaining a restraining order, this may

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:13.230
just infuriate them and cause them to get
violent.

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:18.450
Besides that, we need to document everything
that happens, stay vigilant, make sure our

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:23.190
home is locked up at night, and probably buy
some mace for good measure.

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:28.420
In California, which is where Laura is going
to college, stalking is defined as any person

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:34.141
who willfully, maliciously, and repeatedly
follows or harasses another person and who

00:07:34.141 --> 00:07:38.860
makes a credible threat with the intent to
place that person in reasonable fear for his

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:42.780
or her safety, or the safety of his or her
immediate family.

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:48.330
If weeks pass and Marina hasn’t moved, and
instead has gotten more aggressive, elevate

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:50.280
the situation to the police.

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:54.800
You’ll likely be able to get her charged
with stalking with the evidence you’ve accrued

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:56.720
documenting all your encounters.

00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:02.070
According to mental-illness-policy.org, if
someone is considered to be imminently dangerous

00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:07.419
due to a mental illness, they can be involuntarily
admitted to a psychiatric hospital.

00:08:07.419 --> 00:08:13.110
In the movie we later see that she’s already
been diagnosed with psychosis, reactive attachment

00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:15.730
disorder, and trichotillomania.

00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:20.000
Considering these illnesses will be discovered
when she’s being investigated, it’s likely

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.030
that we could get her involuntarily admitted.

00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:28.171
If we successfully get her admitted, she might
not be able to do some ritualistic black mirror

00:08:28.171 --> 00:08:33.190
suicide so she could possess and murder our
friends, and we could go about our life as

00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:34.190
normal.

00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:40.260
Say we stupidly accepted her friend request
through pity, and we went for a nice walk

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.399
after class to get to know each other.

00:08:42.399 --> 00:08:48.040
Well, we’ll quickly realize our mistake
when she starts blowing up our DM’s saying

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:52.389
that she feels like our souls are connected
and we already know each other well because

00:08:52.389 --> 00:08:54.860
we share everything on social media.

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:58.800
We start having nightmares of her standing
outside our window at night, and the next

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:02.949
morning we see that she has photoshopped a
picture of us two together, and is going through

00:09:02.949 --> 00:09:05.570
every single one of our facebook posts.

00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:09.270
She skypes us to ask about our birthday party
and if she can come.

00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:10.270
What do we do now?

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:16.830
I’m in agreement with Laura’s friends,
saying fuck no, just in a nicer way.

00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:20.750
Probably best not to lie about not having
a party when it’s going to be posted all

00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:23.440
over our Facebook profile that she’s stalking.

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:28.110
We’ll just tell her it was nice meeting
her but this party is with our long-time close

00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:31.480
friends and family and you haven’t really
known her that long.

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:35.560
She’s probably still going to blow up as
she’s mentally ill but it’s better than

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:38.720
straight up lying and for sure looking like
a bitch.

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:41.630
Or at least we can say our friends surprised
us.

00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:45.210
I think either way we handle it, she’s going
to blow.

00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:49.940
Like we talked about earlier, it’s better
to firmly decline and ignore, rather than

00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:55.370
lie to the stalker and continue to validate
their perception that you’re in a relationship.

00:09:55.370 --> 00:10:00.420
Hopefully doing this will avoid her public
freakout and humiliation that sparks her thirst

00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:04.260
for revenge because she thinks we’re a lying
deceptive piece of shit.

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:09.950
It’s still likely that she’ll turn murderous
when we unfriend her on Facebook, as she’s

00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:13.730
obviously treading a thin mental line between
functioning and psychotic.

00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:17.880
Cue the archetypal thunderstorm the night
we unfriend her.

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:19.540
Definitely not a bad sign.

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:23.270
We hear some creepy voices in the hallway
and go to check it out.

00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:27.310
There’s a black mirror on the wall, it’s
nothing that we put up, and it’s almost

00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:30.950
identical to the one in Marina’s Facebook
newsfeed animation.

00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:34.890
Personally, I would not look into that mirror,
hell no.

00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:39.410
Our friend snaps us out of it, and we see
that the strange black mirror is gone.

00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:44.210
I love how in the movie Laura just passes
this off as a bad dream like the nightmare

00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:45.940
we had earlier on.

00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:47.550
This is way different.

00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:53.710
We were studying in our room, heard creepy
voices, and straight up completely hallucinated

00:10:53.710 --> 00:11:00.540
a scrying mirror on the wall with a dark figure
moving in the mirror, exactly like Marina’s

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:01.540
animation.

00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:06.899
If Laura was munching on shrooms before this
than sure, but otherwise this would be really

00:11:06.899 --> 00:11:08.680
fucking alarming.

00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:12.880
Considering we have a stalker after us that’s
into witchcraft, we definitely need to take

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:16.670
into account that something is happening that
can’t just be coincidental.

00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:22.120
The next morning in class, the teacher announces
that Marina committed suicide.

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:25.930
Obviously we’re going to feel a bit guilty,
even though we did nothing wrong.

00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:30.180
Up until now, it’s all been mostly unfortunate
and weird happenings.

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:33.870
But now, the seriously messed up shit starts
happening.

00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:36.250
Later that night, we get a buzz on our computer.

00:11:36.250 --> 00:11:38.760
It’s a message from Marina.

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:41.140
Ohhhhh shit.

00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:42.970
Even worse, it’s a video.

00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:47.990
It looks like a portrait sketch of us, probably
the birthday present she made for us.

00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:52.740
The picture gets crumpled up by Marina, and
she hangs herself over a fire in front of

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:53.790
her webcam.

00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:58.330
The real question is how did she get internet
connection down there, and how did she hit

00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:02.410
stop record and then send the video after
committing suicide.

00:12:02.410 --> 00:12:03.410
Spooky.

00:12:03.410 --> 00:12:10.020
And why did she need to light herself on fire
and hang herself, seem redundant and overkill.

00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:15.260
The next day, we get text messages asking
us, “Why we posted it on Facebook.”

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:19.861
Jesus, that phrase is enough to induce an
anxiety attack in anyone that hasn’t even

00:12:19.861 --> 00:12:21.890
experienced what we have.

00:12:21.890 --> 00:12:28.180
We log on and find out that Marina’s suicide
video was somehow posted on our Facebook page.

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:31.510
Of course we try deleting it, but we get an
unknown error.

00:12:31.510 --> 00:12:36.300
We call Facebook’s customer support, they
say they physically can’t remove the post

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:37.930
or our account.

00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:39.080
Okayyy.

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:44.230
If we’re being realistic, Facebook would
definitely identify the ghost code and Zuckerberg

00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:46.910
would be getting a phone call within the hour.

00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:57.771
In the movie we end up relying on Kobe, aka
hackerman, and find out that there is some

00:12:57.771 --> 00:13:01.070
haunted ghost code that’s preventing us
from doing so.

00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:06.310
Now this ghost code shit is pretty damning
that there is something crazy going on.

00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:10.640
We also find out from Kobe that Marina is
still posting on Facebook.

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:13.990
And she’s posting some seriously disturbing
stuff.

00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:15.990
What oh what shall we do?

00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:20.420
I mean, even without there being ghost code
in the source code of the page, we can’t

00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:24.560
allow a hacker to post suicide videos on our
online accounts.

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:29.850
Our reputation, future job prospects and relationships
are all going to be tainted.

00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:32.640
We could also be charged with crimes for it
too.

00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:35.670
The ghost code though, that’s the real concern.

00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:37.700
And it’s not just a concern to you.

00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:42.770
The hacking and supernatural abilities that
Marina possesses is an existential threat

00:13:42.770 --> 00:13:44.650
to everyone on the planet.

00:13:44.650 --> 00:13:49.529
This is definitely above our paygrade, which
is nonexistent because we’re a psych student

00:13:49.529 --> 00:13:50.590
in college.

00:13:50.590 --> 00:13:52.910
We need to take this to the highest level.

00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:58.970
We need to contact Facebook, the police, the
government, science organizations, news agencies,

00:13:58.970 --> 00:14:02.980
post on reddit forums, and literally spread
the word everywhere.

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:07.890
Since this ghost code can be seen by everyone,
and since Facebook was technically unable

00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:12.540
to take our posts or account down due to it,
it’s reasonable to assume that anyone testing

00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:15.290
this will run into this ghost code as well.

00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:19.870
You think Zuckerberg isn’t going to flip
shit at haunted code controlling Facebook

00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:23.470
and posting suicide videos that can’t be
taken down?

00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:27.860
The brightest minds and organizations with
the biggest budgets will start working on

00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:31.670
reverse engineering it and come up with a
plan to remedy it.

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:34.390
Finding out what’s going on is super important.

00:14:34.390 --> 00:14:39.100
These black mirrors are supposedly interdimensional
or something, I mean, we could easily end

00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:43.089
up doing something wrong or not knowing about
an important danger of them,

00:14:43.089 --> 00:14:47.310
We’d also succeed in convincing everyone
that we actually can't delete the videos on

00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:51.940
our account and that nobody should be mad
at us because our account is essentially being

00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:55.459
hacked by a super hackers ghost code.

00:14:55.459 --> 00:14:59.540
Unfortunately, nobody would be able to stop
Marina's next actions.

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:02.540
We find out Gustavo is dead.

00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:04.800
There is security footage of his death.

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:11.240
He seemingly lost his mind and committed suicide
by bashing his head into the wall repeatedly.

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:13.630
Obviously this is not Gustavo's doing.

00:15:13.630 --> 00:15:15.240
All this shit is connected.

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:21.130
Marina's witchcraft and suicide, our hallucination
of the scrying mirror, the ghost code.

00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:25.620
While taking it to the highest level is still
probably the best course of action, let’s

00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:30.040
instead see what we could personally do without
the rest of the world intervening.

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:34.980
It doesn't take much digging to reveal that
in fiction and folklore, scrying mirrors were

00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:40.769
used as portals to communicate with other
realms,and they can be used to possess unsuspecting

00:15:40.769 --> 00:15:41.769
onlookers.

00:15:41.769 --> 00:15:46.560
It’s probable that Marina possessed Gustavo
through a black mirror hallucination like

00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:48.459
the one we experienced.

00:15:48.459 --> 00:15:53.850
It sounds fucking rediculous, I mean, what
is this the plot from a shitty netflix horror

00:15:53.850 --> 00:15:54.850
movie?

00:15:54.850 --> 00:15:59.529
Nothing that's occurring seems to be possible,
but extraordinary circumstances calls for

00:15:59.529 --> 00:16:01.730
extraordinary solutions.

00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:06.959
We find out via a 4chan article, that the
only way to defeat it is to destroy the mirror

00:16:06.959 --> 00:16:10.670
that Marina used for her suicidal scrying
ritual.

00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:16.640
Before trying to destroy a mirror based on
a 4chan article, we'd probably want to consult

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:19.399
with the scientists we opened a dialogue with
earlier.

00:16:19.399 --> 00:16:23.060
Ya know, just in case 4chan was somehow wrong.

00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:26.960
Marina posts the footage of Gustavo’s death
on our Facebook page.

00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:30.790
We try to write on our Facebook page that
we aren’t in control and that it’s being

00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:32.110
hacked.

00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:36.360
Before we can post it, Marina hacks it and
rewrites a different message.

00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:40.700
She writes that she wants us to feel as alone
as she does.

00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:45.589
Starting with Gustavo, she’s going after
our friends and family, one by one, killing

00:16:45.589 --> 00:16:48.320
them via possession driven suicide.

00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:49.590
What do we do?

00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:53.740
Since we can’t feel lonely if we’re dead,
we’re most likely safe.

00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:58.140
With Gustavo being singled out and killed
earlier, Marina doesn’t appear to be able

00:16:58.140 --> 00:17:00.990
to possess and kill multiple people at a time.

00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:03.670
By themselves, our friends and family are
vulnerable.

00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:05.870
Together, they are safer.

00:17:05.870 --> 00:17:10.130
If Marina can only possess one of them at
a time, then the others in the group could

00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:13.050
restrain them before they harm themselves.

00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:15.510
While it’s risky, it’s necessary.

00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:18.549
We need to contact all of our close friends
and family.

00:17:18.549 --> 00:17:22.980
We need to tell them that after this call
they need to drop all their technology, drop

00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:27.670
their phones and laptops, drop anything that
could resemble a mirror.

00:17:27.670 --> 00:17:31.539
Anything that can resemble a black mirror
is dangerous as it’s a portal that Marina

00:17:31.539 --> 00:17:35.510
can use to possess them and force them to
commit suicide.

00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:39.570
Tell them they need to throw some food and
water into a backpack and to all meet up at

00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:40.859
a nearby park.

00:17:40.859 --> 00:17:45.489
They need to get rid of any weapon, as there
is nothing real that attacks them, Marina

00:17:45.489 --> 00:17:48.690
will just make them commit suicide with it.

00:17:48.690 --> 00:17:51.980
Tell them we’ll find and tell them when
it’s safe to return.

00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:56.830
These people have known us for a long time,
there is enough evidence of crazy shit going

00:17:56.830 --> 00:17:58.239
on to convince them.

00:17:58.239 --> 00:18:02.769
If we say to do this and that they need to
trust us, they will probably do it.

00:18:02.769 --> 00:18:07.649
Now that they are as safe as can be, we can
attempt to find and destroy the black mirror,

00:18:07.649 --> 00:18:10.289
or laptop, that Marina used in her suicide.

00:18:10.289 --> 00:18:12.639
It’s our best shot at stopping this.

00:18:12.639 --> 00:18:16.129
We need to figure out who the fuck Marina
actually is.

00:18:16.129 --> 00:18:21.059
Although the school database was wiped, her
dorm room contained lots of evidence.

00:18:21.059 --> 00:18:24.890
Most importantly, a picture of her orphanage
with her as a kid.

00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:30.249
Easy enough, go to the orphanage, show them
a picture of her, get a name from their records.

00:18:30.249 --> 00:18:33.640
We find that her last name is Marina Nedifar.

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:38.200
We also get some lovely stories about how
she was tormented and bullied.

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:43.309
Bonus points for getting the orphanage shut
down for allowing bullying and physical abuse

00:18:43.309 --> 00:18:49.090
of the orphans, and doing absolutely nothing
about the severe mental issues that an orphan

00:18:49.090 --> 00:18:51.139
was improperly dealing with.

00:18:51.139 --> 00:18:56.010
Marina is not discrete at all, she pretty
much posts everything that matters to her

00:18:56.010 --> 00:18:57.010
online.

00:18:57.010 --> 00:19:01.249
All her posts, artwork, and animations are
clues as to what she is dealing with, her

00:19:01.249 --> 00:19:06.020
childhood trauma, who she’s going to kill
next, and important locations.

00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:10.989
It won’t be hard to find the place of her
suicide as she’s very sentimental and likely

00:19:10.989 --> 00:19:14.610
to off herself at a place of deep emotional
importance.

00:19:14.610 --> 00:19:17.749
This will also be the place of the black mirror
we need to destroy.

00:19:17.749 --> 00:19:21.669
Here’s the tricky part, and where Laura
fucked up in the movie.

00:19:21.669 --> 00:19:26.909
We already know that looking into black mirrors
is dangerous, as it’s an attack vector for

00:19:26.909 --> 00:19:27.909
Marina.

00:19:27.909 --> 00:19:32.580
The black mirror that Marina committed suicide
infront of is probably particularly dangerous

00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:33.779
to look at.

00:19:33.779 --> 00:19:38.360
In the movie, when Laura got close to the
computer, Marina started calling to her to

00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:39.429
come to the computer.

00:19:39.429 --> 00:19:42.970
Uh you should do the opposite of that shit.

00:19:42.970 --> 00:19:47.629
In order for scrying for work and a demonic
internet connection to occur, you need to

00:19:47.629 --> 00:19:51.090
be reasonably close and gaze into the black
mirror.

00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:56.649
So whatever you do, keep your distance, don’t
look at it, blindfold yourself if possible.

00:19:56.649 --> 00:19:59.850
Maybe bring a molotov cocktail and toss it
at the computer.

00:19:59.850 --> 00:20:04.410
Once you’ve destroyed the original black
mirror, you need to make sure you actually

00:20:04.410 --> 00:20:06.080
stopped Marina.

00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:09.309
Test deleting the Facebook posts and checking
for ghost code.

00:20:09.309 --> 00:20:14.090
If it's not there, go find your friends at
the park and reintroduce tech to one person

00:20:14.090 --> 00:20:15.090
in the group.

00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:20.399
We’ll also want to use a buddy system for
the following week so that nobody is completely

00:20:20.399 --> 00:20:23.309
alone if they do get possessed somehow.

00:20:23.309 --> 00:20:28.600
If destroying the mirror doesn’t stop the
killings, the only other option is to kill

00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:29.600
ourselves.

00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:34.590
It’s a shitty option and doesn’t necessarily
stop Marina, but if it’s between that and

00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:38.789
all your friends and family getting murdered,
it might be the right choice.

00:20:38.789 --> 00:20:41.609
Hopefully it doesn’t come to us killing
ourselves though.

00:20:41.609 --> 00:20:46.419
Hopefully, we were able to make enough correct
decisions to successfully not get possessed

00:20:46.419 --> 00:20:50.230
and turned into Marina 2.0 like Laura at the
end of the movie.

00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:51.230
What do you think?

00:20:51.230 --> 00:20:52.769
How would you beat Marina?

00:20:52.769 --> 00:20:54.179
Let me know in the comments.

00:20:54.179 --> 00:20:57.899
If you enjoy these how to beat videos, consider
subscribing.

00:20:57.899 --> 00:21:01.610
If you have a movie you’d like me to talk
about beating next, let me know.

00:21:01.610 --> 00:21:14.199
Thanks for watching, later.
