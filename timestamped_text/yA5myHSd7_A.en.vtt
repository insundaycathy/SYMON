00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:28.000
how awful state hospitals are and how he can give&nbsp;
her mom the best doctors instead that very night&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.880
dominica goes to the hotel eustinov is staying&nbsp;
in wearing the dress she's been given she goes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:37.760
to the bar to wait for houstonov to approach her&nbsp;
first which he does dominica tells him she's come&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.400
to see him wanting to feel special again so they&nbsp;
leave for her room she asks the guards to give&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.960
them privacy and eustanov starts undressing as&nbsp;
soon as his men leave the room then asks dominica&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:52.240
to do the same she does so after some hesitation&nbsp;
and when she comes closer eustanov wastes no time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:56.000
in taking advantage of her their intercourse&nbsp;
is suddenly interrupted when a man wearing a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.880
black helmet appears behind houstonov and cuts his&nbsp;
throat the body is thrown on the floor and after&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.200
asking for silence with a gesture the man throws&nbsp;
dominica a coat for her to cover her blood-stained&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.200
body and takes her out of the room through a&nbsp;
back door when they make it to the parking lot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.520
he shoots an employee before getting them on his&nbsp;
bike and driving away to an abandoned building&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:18.320
inside the man takes off his helmet to reveal&nbsp;
sergey mataran another secret service agent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.800
sent by yvonne who is in another room in the same&nbsp;
building together with korchnoy watching dominica&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.440
on the security cameras when korchnoy mentions&nbsp;
she's a witness and she should be eliminated&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.800
yvonne mentions she could be useful yvonne changes&nbsp;
rooms to go see dominica and confesses he did know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.720
what would happen in that room and didn't tell&nbsp;
her because she wouldn't have done it if she knew&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.520
he makes her an offer then since she's so good at&nbsp;
this she can be sent to a special institution to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:46.480
be trained to be an agent if she refuses he won't&nbsp;
be able to protect her so she can only accept&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:51.360
dominica leaves for the institution a couple of&nbsp;
days later when she arrives there she's received&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:56.240
by matron the headmistress of sparrow school&nbsp;
she gives dominica a fake name to use in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.800
school before taking her to her room classes&nbsp;
start soon after that matron talks about the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.840
modern world being in chaos and how russia is the&nbsp;
only country willing to make sacrifices to fix it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:10.320
the students will be trained to be sparrows spies&nbsp;
who specialized in seduction and psychological&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:14.240
manipulation dominica and a student named&nbsp;
victor are called to the front of the class&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:20.160
and asked to strip victor does so without issues&nbsp;
but dominica doesn't dare matron scolds her for it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.560
we then cut to nate who's been summoned by the&nbsp;
cia's discipline panel to be informed he'll be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:29.120
suspended for his mistake in russia and he can't&nbsp;
leave the country nate protests because their mole&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:33.600
marble has been working with nate for three years&nbsp;
and won't trust anybody else but he isn't heard&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.240
back in the sparrow school during a class with&nbsp;
matron she tells them they need to be able to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:43.120
identify what their targets want she put some&nbsp;
videos on tv for examples for them to work on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.200
the first one victor guesses wrong and&nbsp;
dominica corrects him earning her his dislike&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:51.520
the second is guest by another female student who&nbsp;
is called to the front of the class and told she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:55.680
will have to use her mouth on the man from the&nbsp;
video who is brought into the classroom in cuffs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:00.560
the girl gets on her knees but is incapable of&nbsp;
doing it she falls to the floor crying matron&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:04.480
reminds all the students that they need to learn&nbsp;
to trick their bodies and teaches them some basic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:10.320
seduction tricks back in the usa nate notices he's&nbsp;
being tailed and informs his superiors of this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:14.480
he learns that the cia hasn't heard anything from&nbsp;
marvel and he takes the chance to remind them he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:19.040
will talk if it's nate that contacts him they&nbsp;
reach a deal he can't still go back to russia&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:23.280
but they can send him to a country nearby so the&nbsp;
russian secret service will know he's around and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:28.640
marble will resurface nate accepts for the team to&nbsp;
come with him meanwhile in the school the students&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:37.840
a young man and takes him to her room where she&nbsp;
successfully gives him a hand later that day&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:42.160
