00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.930
Welcome to Moviecaps.

00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:07.810
Today I will show you an Action, Crime, Drama
film from 2005, titled Lord of war.

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:09.260
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:11.250
Watch out and take care.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.190
It's the early 1980’s.

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.230
This is Yuri Orlov, the eldest son of a family
of Ukrainian refugees.

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.929
It is his fake name he used to have to escape
the soviet union in the 70’s.

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:23.470
His brother Vitaly.

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.329
They are fake jews, on the other hand their
father was more jewish than jews.

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:31.599
Vitaly walks into a restaurant at Brighton
Beach called Palace as two would-be assasins

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:36.239
holding Kalashnikov rifles walk right behind
him, they shoot up the place, then get killed

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.079
themselves by a russian mobster, right in
front of Yuri.

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.370
This is when everything started for Yuri.

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.550
He believes that the constant need for weapons
is similar to human need for food and drink,

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:48.160
thus he can make a fortune.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.210
He got his first submachine gun supplier.

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.640
It was his first time selling a gun, he had
no clue what he was doing and compared it

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.620
to losing virginity, you don't know what to
expect and it happens fast.

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.050
He is very good at smuggling contraband and
persuading people.

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.170
He chained his first bullet to commemorate
his first sale.

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.600
Vitaly is a drunk, even so, Yuri needs a partner
so he chose his brother.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.549
Vitaly is hesitant, but without much conviction
needed he agrees.

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:18.750
A while later they are at an arms sale convention,
Yuri is here to find Simeon Weisz, a gun dealer

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.360
that takes war sides, but Yuri's business
proposal to just supply guns to both parties

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.020
is not worthwhile.

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.590
Simeon calls Yuri an amateur, that's how their
rivalry began.

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.850
So their only option for now is under the
counter gun sale.

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.049
A while later two brothers get their first
big break during the Lebanon war.

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:39.920
Yuri made weapon piles that were left after
the United Nations withdrew, since it costs

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.079
more to bring guns back than to buy new.

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:46.979
He’s selling the guns by kilo, which is
possible by bribing Lieutenant Curnel.

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.100
Military wages were no good then, so that
wasn't a problem.

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.130
He is selling guns to both Israeli and Lebanese
troops despite witnessing the same weapons

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.450
being used to commit war crimes and other
atrocities.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.740
As they are walking and talking about miniscule
profits, they are terrified by shots that

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.969
are directed at Lebanon civilians, almost
harming them.

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:09.720
They sold israeli made uzis to muslims, communist
made bullets to fascists.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.790
Back at home, we see that Yuri owns a private
container for his multiple lives, depending

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.050
on the region of the world he’s visiting.

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.170
As they are on the ship - Kristol, they are
tipped off to authorities, as told by his

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.180
informant, Yuri commands his crew to quickly
change the name of the ship to Kono and the

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.750
country flag they come from to Denmark.

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.450
Unfortunately they don’t have Denmark flag
but with Vitaly’s quick thinking they put

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.870
up a French flag sideways, that became Dutch
flag, since the ship is registered in netherlands,

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.170
there should be no issues.

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.370
Jack Valentine, an idealistic interpol agent,
represents a unique threat to Yuri because

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.150
he is after glory, not money, and thus cannot
be bought off.

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.370
To lead agents off his case, Yuris strategy
this time was to fill his containers with

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:56.370
one week old potatoes, which luckily discontinues
search attempts.

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.590
While Yuri is supplying the Colombian drug
lord with guns, he doesn't get paid with money,

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.250
but instead cocaine.

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.030
He doesn't want to accept it.

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.170
That escalates into an argument that ends
with him being shot.

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.790
While driving away, they decide to celebrate
and numb the pain from the gun wound with

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.090
the cocaine.

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.710
That is the wrong thing to do, because his
brother is a known addict.

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:19.550
As presumed, his brother disappeared with
one kilo of cocaine.

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:25.250
So Yuri traveled 2000 miles to find his brother
- Vitaly in a boarding house, high and disoriented,

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.890
mapping the border of Ukraine with cocaine.

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:32.050
Yuri sweeps it off, which makes Vitaly lash
out at him.

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:36.570
Yuri drags his brother to America and sends
him to a rehabilitation facility, after giving

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:41.250
him his last sniff, they say goodbye and Yuri
continues his business alone.

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.080
From the very childhood Ava Fontaine, the
model, was someone Yuri was chasing as his

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:46.410
dream woman.

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.860
So that was his next move, he reserved the
whole hotel and booked her for a fake fotoshoot,

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.180
so that they would be the only ones there.

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.130
After getting to know each other, Ava says
that there are no flights back to Miami until

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:01.540
Thursday, of course Yuri knows this so he
offers Ava a flight on his private jet.

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.850
He uses most of his wealth just to deceive
her and prove to her he is anything but poor.

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:10.600
He even painted a plane with his family name
just so it seems that he owns the plane.

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.930
A few charming lines later, Ava feels like
fate brought them together, subsequently they

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:16.590
get married and have a son.

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.060
Skip another few years, it's 1991.

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:24.080
the cold war of the soviet union is over,
Yuri is overjoyed since they've been having

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.310
financial issues for some time.

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:30.450
Now he can get back into the business, he
is more overjoyed from the end of cold war,

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:34.389
than learning that his son just walked for
the first time, which in fact upsets Ava.

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:39.349
Vitaly is seen walking drunk into Yuri's apartment,
upsetting the whole family, so he is sent

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:41.110
back into rehab.

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:44.139
Following recent news Yuri goes to his uncle
in Ukraine.

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:48.770
He is talking with his uncle - general Dimitry
who oversees weapon distribution, he is hesitant

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:53.129
to sell guns to Yuri, because how can he report
missing guns to higher ups?

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:56.979
Yuri says that no one cares about the guns
they have anymore and he has no one to report

00:04:56.979 --> 00:05:01.450
to, since Moscow now is a foreign country
and no one has taken over in Ukraine, that

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:03.259
convinces the general.

00:05:03.259 --> 00:05:08.360
Huge weapon stockpiles are seen, 40 thousand
kalashnikovs are in stock, but Yuri suggests

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:12.129
to change that number to 10 thousand and no
one would even know it, that's how Yuri got

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:16.870
his hands on the biggest weapon stockpile
in his life, even tanks and helicopters.

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:20.479
And that's where his long time rival – Simeon,
steps in.

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:24.729
They are having dinner and Yuri learns that
Simeon does not operate well in chaotic conditions

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:27.070
– which is where Yuri himself thrives.

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:30.710
When Simeon hints at working together, Yuri
calls him an amateur and that they should

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:34.419
work separately, repaying for declining him
all those years ago.

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:38.680
When Yuri is loading the ships with weapons,
agent Valentine comes back in the picture,

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:43.150
Dimitry says that Yuri is too greedy, loading
military helicopters on ships for transport

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:44.969
is a major violation.

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:49.569
So Yuri does what he does best, changes the
military helicopter to look like a rescue

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:50.569
helicopter.

00:05:50.569 --> 00:05:54.660
As Valentine comes to Yuri he is not surprised
to see him, always at the wrong place, at

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:56.050
the right time.

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:00.080
With all the guns pointed at Yuri, he calmly
explains to Valentine that all the weapons

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:04.570
and vehicles comply with europe trade standards,
and he cannot do anything about it, except

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:08.550
be suspicious, and suspicion is not constituted
as a crime.

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:12.770
After having an exclusive car gifted to him
by Yuri, General Dimitry is calling himself

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:14.639
the luckiest man alive.

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:19.569
Unfortunately when he steps into the car,
it blows up, which devastates Yuri.

00:06:19.569 --> 00:06:23.620
Despite General's death, the deal still goes
through, and is marked as the biggest illegal

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:26.650
arms trade of the 20th century.

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:30.900
Yuri expands his business to Africa, the largest
arms consumers there are.

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:36.349
There he meets Andre Baptist, american educated,
self declared president of Monrovia, a ruthless

00:06:36.349 --> 00:06:39.719
dictator who's engaged in a brutal war in
Liberia.

00:06:39.719 --> 00:06:45.460
Andre junior, Baptists son, with a golden
ak47 demands that Yuri comes and meets his

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:46.460
father.

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:49.449
After a decline from Yuri, he is told that
it’s not an option.

00:06:49.449 --> 00:06:53.969
At Baptist stronghold, Yuri is talking about
guns, when Baptist kills one of his soldiers

00:06:53.969 --> 00:06:56.849
right before his eyes for disrespecting him.

00:06:56.849 --> 00:07:01.229
Yuri yells at Baptist, guns get pointed at
Yuri, but before things escalate, he says

00:07:01.229 --> 00:07:05.449
that Baptist has to buy the gun, as if pointing
out that he is furious not because of him

00:07:05.449 --> 00:07:09.849
killing his soldier, but using a gun he hasn't
paid for yet, to do so.

00:07:09.849 --> 00:07:13.510
This humors Baptist, and he accepts Yuri as
his arms dealer.

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:18.159
Andre junior drives Yuri outside town to a
supposedly 2 star hotel, and has a present

00:07:18.159 --> 00:07:19.449
from his father.

00:07:19.449 --> 00:07:21.659
The present is two beautiful women.

00:07:21.659 --> 00:07:25.949
Yuri tries to call it off, since 1 in 4 people
in Monrovia have AIDS.

00:07:25.949 --> 00:07:30.139
They are trying their best to seduce Yuri,
but he still asks them to leave.

00:07:30.139 --> 00:07:34.330
Baptist shows how fond he is of his army of
kids, his country isn't rich, so he can't

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:38.650
pay him in money, but he is ready to pay him
in timber or blood diamonds.

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:40.389
Yuri takes the diamonds.

00:07:40.389 --> 00:07:45.189
Yuri knows that Baptist wants to go offensive,
so he suggests delaying his attack for a week,

00:07:45.189 --> 00:07:48.979
offering him his armored personnel carriers
he got from Ukraine, as that would reduce

00:07:48.979 --> 00:07:50.559
his casualties exponentially.

00:07:50.559 --> 00:07:55.849
It is the late 90’s and Yuri's wealth has
caught up and even surpassed his lies to Ava.

00:07:55.849 --> 00:07:59.840
Ava started painting and an anonymous patron
bought a painting of hers.

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:03.580
She was ecstatic about it, but didn't know
that the anonymous patron was Yuri.

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:07.129
Vitaly is seen doing better, but looks jealous
of Yuri.

00:08:07.129 --> 00:08:11.400
Vitaly asks if Ava knows about Yuri's line
of work, which he denies.

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:15.409
Ava shouldn't know anything about his multiple
lives, at the same time he was wondering how

00:08:15.409 --> 00:08:18.689
much Ava really knew and how much she chose
to ignore.

00:08:18.689 --> 00:08:22.870
Not everything is always smooth sailing for
Yuri, there are setbacks, like sending guns

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:26.919
to the country that started peace talks and
entered a truce, it's not called gun running

00:08:26.919 --> 00:08:29.689
for nothing, you have to be fast on your feet.

00:08:29.689 --> 00:08:32.950
New times come, and a new breed of cop is
needed.

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:37.320
Yuri is being investigated by the FBI, so
he is constantly on the lookout.

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:41.169
To lose the helicopter that is giving chase,
he gets out of his limousine and gets into

00:08:41.169 --> 00:08:43.750
a taxi, to drive to his container.

00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:47.742
As he stores another one of his wife's paintings,
he gets a call from her, telling him there

00:08:47.742 --> 00:08:51.530
are men going through their garbage and asking
him if there is something she should be worried

00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:52.600
about.

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:56.900
Yuri dismisses her, telling that everything
is fine and he loves her.

00:08:56.900 --> 00:09:00.930
Valentine has put together a paper containing
information about Yuri's next move.

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:03.470
At this point Yuri is the best death merchant
alive.

00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:06.410
He doesn't own a plane, he owns a whole fleet.

00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:10.630
Most trips Yuri has phony paperwork, but he
isn't overly concerned, there are hardly any

00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:14.400
radars over Africa, and even fewer people
to watch them.

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:19.930
Unfortunately during one flight to Africa
in 2001, Yuris plane is intercepted by Valentine

00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:22.790
and, after an array of bullets he is forced
to land.

00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:27.740
Yuri escapes arrest by landing in a remote
area and giving away all of his cargo to locals,

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:31.490
offering it as free samples, leaving no evidence
to charge him for.

00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:36.080
As one of the locals tries to kill Yuri, noting
that people disappear there all the time,

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:40.590
he is dissuaded by Valentine, saying he is
going to get what's coming to him.

00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:44.780
Valentine decides to hold Yuri detained for
24 hours, it’s in his right, so that Yuri

00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:47.270
has less time to do his crimes.

00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:51.240
Valentine didn't guard Yuri, he knew he had
nowhere to go, or he hoped that locals would

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:55.080
tear him apart, but they were too busy with
the plane.

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:59.870
Upon returning to his hotel, Yuri is shocked
to see Baptist, his son and Simeon, who is

00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:01.620
tied to a chair.

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:06.140
Baptist offers Yuri to kill Simeon, he is
his competitor and also killed his uncle.

00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:10.640
Yuri doesn't want to kill him, but also refuses
to let him go, so as a bonding experience

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:15.320
Baptist places a gun in Yuri's hand, still
giving him a chance to say stop.

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:17.930
Yuri is silent and Simeon is shot dead.

00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:22.060
That night Yuri tried cocaine mixed with gunpowder,
which is called brown brown, for the first

00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:23.060
time.

00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:25.220
It is said that it makes you do anything.

00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:29.820
Barely conscious, he sees a woman on him and
asks if she is infected, without response

00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:31.130
she leaves.

00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:34.850
Experiencing hallucinations of Simeon and
basically wanting to die, as one of guards

00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:38.580
tries to shoot at Yuri, the gun misfires,
twice.

00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:42.800
Even hyenas he sees in the desert walk away
from him, he starts to feel cursed, curse

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:44.740
of invincibility.

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:48.620
Valentine tells Ava her husband is an arms
dealer, prompting her to confront him, even

00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:52.800
set him up, he tries to persuade her telling
that Yuri is exactly the kind of a man who

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:57.040
is responsible for the death of her parents,
selling illegal firearms.

00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:01.380
Upon returning home, Ava tells Yuri she can’t
wear the clothes, can't wear the jewelry,

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:05.420
can’t drive the car or live in this house,
everything has blood on it.

00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:09.600
Yuri admits to selling guns, Ava pleads him
to stop, that they have enough.

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:13.950
For Yuri it's not about the money, he is just
good at it, so Ava gives him an ultimatum,

00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:15.700
her or his arms trade.

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:20.540
To please his wife, Yuri tries to legitimize
his business with timber sales, even Valentine

00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:22.980
gets confused by tapping on his calls.

00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:27.900
Yuri soon becomes frustrated with the difficulties
and lower earnings of honest work, but still,

00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:30.250
he made a promise to Ava.

00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:34.200
Baptist comes to America for peace talks with
the United Nations, before they begin he gives

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:37.070
Yuri a visit, hoping to strike another deal.

00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:41.480
Yuri refuses at first, but after being offered
the largest payday of his career, a stash

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:44.990
of diamonds, Yuri goes back to crime one last
time.

00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:49.670
On the day of his departure, he explains the
situation to his wife, and asks if she trusts

00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:52.670
him, she lies without flinching and Yuri suspects
it.

00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:57.310
Ava tails Yuri, to expose his lies, Yuri leads
her right to his container containing his

00:11:57.310 --> 00:11:58.830
multiple lives.

00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:02.640
As she unlocks it, she is devastated by its
content.

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:06.790
Before departing to Liberia, Yuri visits his
brother Vitaly asking him for assistance with

00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:08.190
a major deal.

00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:10.680
Reluctantly, Vitaly agrees.

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:14.951
After they land, Baptist says that the delivery
will be done only after they deliver the guns

00:12:14.951 --> 00:12:18.900
to his neighbours to the west - Sierra Leone,
to the freedom fighters.

00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:23.000
At the business table, Vitaly is checking
the camp, after seeing one woman being gutted

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.740
for running after her son, Vitaly pleads with
Yuri to abandon the deal, but Yuri refuses

00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:31.800
knowing that Baptist’s men will kill them
for refusing to hand over the guns.Vitaly

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:36.480
is disgusted by his brother, unable to stomach
the guilt, Vitaly steals a pair of grenades

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:41.310
and uses them to destroy a truck full of weapons,
accidently killing Andre junior.

00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:45.710
He is gunned down, and while Yuri is spared
due to his relationship with Baptist, he only

00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:47.940
receives half of the diamonds.

00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:53.070
Evil prevails when good men fail to act, what
they ought to say is evil prevails.

00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:57.140
Yuri pays 20 dollars to a Monrovian doctor
to remove bullets from his brother's corpse

00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:59.370
and write a bogus death certificate.

00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:03.360
He should've paid more, the first bullet that
lands Yuri in jail was found under his dead

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:04.710
brother's rib.

00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:08.750
As he is trying to get a hold of Ava, she
is leaving the house for good, when he tries

00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:12.580
to reconcile with his parents, his mother
picks the phone and says that both of his

00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:14.280
sons died that day.

00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:18.200
While in custody and talking with Valentine,
he reveals it was his wife who led them to

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:22.910
the prize, it's not her fault, she was just
easier to follow than Yuri is.

00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:26.970
Yuri tells Valentine to enjoy it, tell him
everything he wants to tell him, because he

00:13:26.970 --> 00:13:28.690
doesn't have long.

00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:32.220
Valentine tells him that he doesn’t appreciate
the seriousness of the situation, that he

00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:36.470
will spend the next 10 years of his life just
going from jail cell to courtroom before starting

00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:38.190
to serve his sentence.

00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:42.780
Yuri is unfazed saying “My family has disowned
me, my wife and son have left me, my brother

00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:43.980
is dead”.

00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:47.290
He fully appreciates the seriousness of the
situation.

00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:51.950
He then proceeds to explain him what exactly
will happen, that a man will come who outranks

00:13:51.950 --> 00:13:55.820
Valentine, he will compliment him on his job
well done, and then he will tell Valentine

00:13:55.820 --> 00:14:00.130
that he is to be released, because that while
he may be a criminal, the United States government

00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:04.320
is willing to turn a blind eye to his crimes,
since most of his weapons end up in the hands

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:08.780
of their allies, who they cannot be seen publicly
supplying with arms.

00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:12.420
Valentines then hears a knock at the door
and realizes that Yuri is right, but before

00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:16.750
walking away, he says “I would tell you
to go to hell, but I think you’re already

00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:17.750
there.”

00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:22.660
Yuri just gets back to what he does best,
being an arms dealer.

00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:25.100
Thank you for watching!
