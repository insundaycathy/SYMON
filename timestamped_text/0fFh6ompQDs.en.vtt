00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.699
Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:06.290
Today, I'm going to explain a mystery and
sci-fi film called "Selfless."

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:07.749
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:07.749 --> 00:00:09.660
Watch out and take care.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.599
New York real-estate mogul Damian Hale is
on the top of his world even at his age.

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.230
Once dubbed as the "The Man Who Built New
York," his business partners and competitors

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.890
look up to him for his wisdom while younger
men strive to be like him.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.650
However, all is not well with him as he starts
to feel his illness catching up to him.

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.770
After being diagnosed with terminal cancer,
the doctors have given him a life expectancy

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.320
of no longer than six months.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.050
Damian seems to have accepted his fate, but
when a mysterious card from a company called

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.890
Phoenix Biogenic, he learns that he can still
extend his life.

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.930
When he contacts the organization, he hears
about a process called "shedding," which will

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.059
allow him to transfer his consciousness into
a new body.

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:54.790
Dr. Albright, the company's scientist, attests
that the bodies are designed and artificially

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:56.649
grown in the laboratory.

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:00.960
Not entirely convinced by the idea, Damian
leaves Albright's office without making a

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.300
decision.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:07.630
With time slipping from his hands, Damian
decides to visit his estranged daughter Claire,

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.470
who heads a non-profit organization in the
city.

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.630
He invites her to enjoy a sundae with him,
but she refuses and tells him that she's too

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:15.630
busy.

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.190
Knowing that her organization is short on
funds, Damian offers to write her a check.

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.630
Claire declines and scolds him for expecting
to solve all problems with his money.

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.360
Back in his office, Damian looks up shedding
on the internet and finds a lecture given

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.800
by Dr. Francis Jensen, who envisions a future
where the aged and the sick are not limited

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.250
by their bodies.

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.990
As he watches the video, Damian starts coughing
until he collapses in his chair.

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.850
In his nursing home, he calls Dr. Albright
and agrees to go through with shedding.

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.820
Albright tells him that he can't get back
to his old life once he gets a new body.

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.400
If he comes across someone he once knew, he
must ignore them.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.150
Albright further stresses that Damian's death
needs to be public and suggests that he should

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.670
stage it at a restaurant called Commander's
in New Orleans.

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.710
Damian prepares for the procedure and heads
to New Orleans, but he stops by a cemetery

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.200
to bury a metal box before going to the restaurant.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.800
Damian meets with his business partner Martin
at the restaurant for lunch and orders the

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.880
coffee suggested by Albright.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.050
A few moments after drinking the coffee, he
starts feeling drowsy and collapses to the

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:19.100
ground.

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.090
He's loaded into an ambulance, but instead
of going straight to the hospital, the driver

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.540
takes Damian to Albright's lab.

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.860
Upon his arrival, they make sure if all the
metal filing in his teeth has been removed.

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.730
Albright discloses that the machine that they'll
use for shedding is a giant magnet, so any

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.610
piece of metal can disrupt the process.

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.530
Damian and another body are loaded simultaneously
inside the machine.

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.260
Once the process is finished, he looks at
the bed next to him and sees his old body

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.320
being covered with a sheet.

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:51.659
With his new body, Damian has to undergo training
to learn how to walk, run and swim.

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:55.130
Albright gives him medication to help him
deal with the side effects of shedding.

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.600
The scientist warns him that he might suffer
from hallucinations, migraines, and nausea

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.240
if he doesn't take the drug.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:05.640
The organization gives him a new identity
with the name Edward Kidner, who is supposed

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.120
to be born on September 20, 1980, in Phoenix,
Arizona.

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.510
Albright takes him to a new house but leaves
him with only seven pills for the side effects.

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.400
He tells Damian that they have to meet weekly,
arguing that he's still learning to deal with

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.650
his new body.

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.540
The doctor assures him that his current arrangement
is only temporary, and he will be able to

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.930
live where he wants in a few months.

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.900
To pass the time, Damian starts playing basketball
with the locals at a court nearby and encounters

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.770
Anton, who offers to take him clubbing to
welcome him to the neighborhood.

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:39.910
Damian starts enjoying his new life and meets
with Anton regularly to party.

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:44.440
However, when he forgets to take his medication
for a day, he hallucinates and sees himself

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.060
taking part in a military operation.

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.270
When his vision continues, he sees images
of a Hispanic woman caring for her child and

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:54.000
a water tower shaped like a pumpkin.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.670
When he asks Albright about the vision, the
doctor dismisses it and tells him that the

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.730
hallucinations are his old memories that are
scrambled and fueled by unresolved emotions

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:02.730
in his past.

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:07.180
He surmises that the Latina woman in the hallucination
could have been someone he met on a one-night

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.370
stand a long time ago.

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.870
Damian tells him that he never mentioned that
the woman was a Latina.

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.240
Albright changes the subject and hands him
a ticket to Hawaii for a change of scenery.

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:21.690
He gives him twice as many drugs and assures
him that he will no longer experience hallucinations

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.660
as long as he doesn't forget to take them.

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.440
Damian starts looking up the water tower on
the internet and finds out that it is located

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.450
in St. Louis, Missouri.

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:34.680
Before going to the airport, he stops by the
cemetery to retrieve the box buried there.

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.290
At the terminal, he buys a ticket for a flight
to St. Louis to find the water tower and the

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:40.470
woman.

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:44.440
Upon reaching the site, he walks to a house
nearby and knocks on the door.

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.740
No one answers the door, so he decides to
go inside.

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:53.100
As he goes through the mail, he learns that
the woman's name is Madeline Bitwell.

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.410
As he looks around, Damian is taken aback
upon seeing a picture of himself with Madeline

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:58.460
and her child.

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:02.440
He finds out from the photos that the man
who once lived in his new body had previously

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.260
served in the military.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:08.940
While he's staring at the pictures, Madeline
enters the house with a gun pointed at Damian.

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:13.190
When Damian slowly turns toward Madeline,
she breaks down and cries as she recognizes

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:16.720
him as her supposedly deceased husband, Mark.

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:20.790
While Madeline tries to make sense of the
situation, a man knocks on the door, looking

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:22.460
for Edward Kidner.

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:26.460
When Damian opens it, he sees the man who
drove him to the airport.

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:30.250
Damian is suddenly distracted by another man
grabbing Madeline, allowing the driver to

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:33.090
tackle him and pin him down on the table.

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:37.190
As the driver subdues him, Anton enters the
room and tells Damian how he ended up with

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:38.650
Mark's body.

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:42.680
Anton reveals that Mark had approached Phoenix
Biogenic when the insurance company failed

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:45.040
to cover his daughter's treatment expenses.

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:49.110
Meanwhile, one of Albright's henchmen burns
down Madeline's pickup truck with a flame

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:50.330
thrower.

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:54.830
Later on, Damian tells Anton that he has to
go to the bathroom to take his pills.

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:58.480
The driver follows him to the toilet to make
sure that he doesn't escape.

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:02.510
After taking the medication, Damian attacks
the driver and kills him.

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:06.840
Upon hearing the noise, Anton and another
operative approach the bathroom.

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:11.610
Damian shoots the henchman on the shoulder,
so Anton tries to negotiate with him.

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:15.760
Damian is suddenly startled by an explosion
outside, so Anton takes the opportunity to

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:17.040
disarm him.

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:21.970
The two men struggle to subdue each other
until Damian tackles Anton out of the house.

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:25.420
Damian immediately runs back inside as Anton
shoots at him.

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:30.250
While Damian tries to wake up Madeline, Anton
orders a henchman to torch the place.

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:34.270
As the smoke builds up inside, Damian and
Madeline exit the house through a hatch on

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:35.610
the floor.

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:39.850
Damian shoots the henchman holding the flamethrower
on the leg, causing him to fall and set Anton

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:41.030
ablaze.

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:46.190
As the fire engulfs him, Anton runs towards
a tub of water and submerges himself in it.

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:49.710
Damian kills the other operatives and leaves
the house with Madeline.

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:54.000
On their way to the van, Damian explains that
he made a deal with Phoenix Biogenic to save

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.720
her daughter, Anna.

00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:00.009
Disappearing was part of the deal because
he had to do certain things that he won't

00:07:00.009 --> 00:07:02.870
be able to get away with if he was alive.

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:06.680
After the short discussion, they go to the
school to fetch Anna, who is very excited

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:08.450
to see her father again.

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:11.120
The three check into a motel to spend the
night.

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:16.120
To avoid questions from Madeline, Damian goes
outside and looks up shedding on the internet.

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:20.430
He comes across a link stating that Jensen
had died in a public library.

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:24.800
Damian watches the video of Jensen again and
notices that the scientist has the same mannerism

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:28.240
as Albright when he touches the temples of
his eyeglasses.

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:32.590
After seeing Albright in the same video, he
deduces that Jensen had taken over Albright's

00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:33.590
body.

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:37.070
Having lost his medication, Damian starts
hallucinating and remembers when Mark met

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:39.150
with Albright in the lab.

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:44.550
Damian goes back to New Orleans to see Dr.
Jensen's wife, Phyllis, who is suffering from

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:46.259
Alzheimer's disease.

00:07:46.259 --> 00:07:50.690
He pretends to be a student of Jensen to find
out how he can access her husband's research,

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:52.820
but she doesn't know where they were stored.

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:56.610
When he learns that Albright visits her each
week, he convinces Phyllis to call him and

00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:58.539
ask him to come over.

00:07:58.539 --> 00:08:02.590
When Albright arrives, Damian asks him for
more pills at gunpoint.

00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:06.340
Albright starts revealing that the medication
not only stops the hallucinations but also

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:08.669
keeps his consciousness intact.

00:08:08.669 --> 00:08:12.380
Without it, his mind will fade, and Mark's
consciousness will return.

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:17.090
However, each dose of the pill takes away
parts of Mark's memories, including his military

00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:18.900
training and his instincts.

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:24.259
If he continues taking the drug regularly,
Mark will soon be gone for good after a year.

00:08:24.259 --> 00:08:28.000
Damian asks Albright to take him back to the
lab, but a henchman manages to disarm him

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.120
on their way out of the house.

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:33.550
Damian starts hallucinating again while they're
walking towards the door.

00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:36.939
As they get closer to the vehicle, Madeline
approaches them.

00:08:36.939 --> 00:08:41.369
A henchman bashes her with the car door, so
Damian breaks free to protect her.

00:08:41.369 --> 00:08:44.089
He kills one henchman by snapping his neck.

00:08:44.089 --> 00:08:47.100
Another operative tackles him and tries to
strangle him.

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:51.220
Madeline gets hold of a gun and shoots, hitting
the henchman in the temple.

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:55.579
Damian hears the man call him Eddie and notices
the exact necklace that Anton wore on his

00:08:55.579 --> 00:08:56.579
neck.

00:08:56.579 --> 00:08:59.649
Anton reveals that he went through multiple
sheddings already.

00:08:59.649 --> 00:09:03.550
He taunts Madeline, hinting that her husband
is keeping secrets from her.

00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:07.089
Anton then tells her to ask Damian if he knows
her birthday.

00:09:07.089 --> 00:09:10.569
Damian takes Anton's pills and drives away
with Madeline and Anna.

00:09:10.569 --> 00:09:14.990
At a gasoline station, Madeline confronts
Damian to ask if he knows any details about

00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:16.740
their life together.

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:20.579
Damian confesses that he had taken over Mark's
body and tells her that her husband is already

00:09:20.579 --> 00:09:21.839
dead.

00:09:21.839 --> 00:09:25.829
Damian offers to help Madeline and her child,
knowing that Albright and his men will kill

00:09:25.829 --> 00:09:27.980
them if they catch up to them.

00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:32.199
The three stop by Martin's house to ask for
help in getting out of the country.

00:09:32.199 --> 00:09:35.290
Damian tells Martin that he went through shedding
and survived.

00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:39.790
Martin, however, refuses to believe until
Damian shows him a deed to the first building

00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:43.600
they bought together and tells him what they
did when they celebrated their first successful

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:44.899
deal.

00:09:44.899 --> 00:09:49.939
After being convinced that Damian is inhabiting
a new body, Martin prepares a plane for them.

00:09:49.939 --> 00:09:52.839
As they wait, Damian teaches Anna how to swim.

00:09:52.839 --> 00:09:57.230
After the lesson, she hears a whirring noise
from across the hall and follows it.

00:09:57.230 --> 00:10:00.649
Damian and Madeline soon start looking for
Anna after he notices that all the mirrors

00:10:00.649 --> 00:10:02.050
in the house are covered.

00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:06.269
When they enter a room full of toys, they
see Anna playing with a young boy.

00:10:06.269 --> 00:10:11.230
Damian takes Anna and tells Madeline that
the boy is Martin's young son, Tony, but he

00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:13.089
died two years ago.

00:10:13.089 --> 00:10:17.160
Martin confesses that he had contacted Phoenix
Biogenics when Tony died.

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:22.230
He tells Damian that operatives from Phoenix
are already waiting for them outside his property.

00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:26.139
Damian tells Martin that the bodies that Phoenix
uses are not exactly grown from scratch but

00:10:26.139 --> 00:10:28.519
were taken from living people.

00:10:28.519 --> 00:10:32.459
After learning the truth about shedding, Martin
decides to help Damian create a diversion

00:10:32.459 --> 00:10:34.850
so Madeline and Anna can escape.

00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:38.379
Martin tells Damian to meet them at a truck
stop, where they'll be waiting for him till

00:10:38.379 --> 00:10:39.800
midnight.

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:43.639
Damian drives out of the house and looks around
for any car following him.

00:10:43.639 --> 00:10:46.120
Two cars soon emerge and shoot at him.

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:51.069
Further down the road, Anton and another operative
wait for Damian in separate vehicles.

00:10:51.069 --> 00:10:55.160
One of the henchmen notices that Damian is
alone in the van, so Anton orders another

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:57.519
driver to check Martin's house.

00:10:57.519 --> 00:11:02.129
The two vehicles manage to box Damian in,
so he reverses the van to smash the car behind

00:11:02.129 --> 00:11:03.129
him.

00:11:03.129 --> 00:11:07.249
However, when he starts driving forward, the
car gets hooked to the rear bumper of his

00:11:07.249 --> 00:11:08.249
van.

00:11:08.249 --> 00:11:11.959
Meanwhile, Martin drives toward them from
the other direction and starts shooting as

00:11:11.959 --> 00:11:14.319
soon as he sees Damian's van.

00:11:14.319 --> 00:11:18.519
With a henchman's car still behind him, he
suddenly turns just before he reaches Anton's

00:11:18.519 --> 00:11:19.519
car.

00:11:19.519 --> 00:11:23.540
Anton hits the other operative's vehicle,
sending it hurtling down the road.

00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:27.440
Anton becomes incapacitated after smashing
into a tree.

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:31.670
Outside the house, Madeline and Anna get lured
into the car of a Phoenix operative as Martin

00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:33.880
tries to catch up to them.

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:37.470
Damian waits for them at the truck stop, but
only Martin arrives.

00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:41.069
Martin tells Damian that he tried to stop
them, but they got into the car before he

00:11:41.069 --> 00:11:42.639
could do anything.

00:11:42.639 --> 00:11:46.560
Martin confesses that he was the one who sent
the Phoenix Biogenic card to Damian because

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:50.139
he felt like he owed Damian for letting him
be a part of his business.

00:11:50.139 --> 00:11:54.160
He gives Damian some pills and reveals that
he was able to reverse engineer it, so they

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:57.249
don't have to depend on Albright anymore.

00:11:57.249 --> 00:12:00.509
Damian refrains from taking pills for the
day in the hopes that he will discover the

00:12:00.509 --> 00:12:03.629
location of Albright's laboratory in his visions.

00:12:03.629 --> 00:12:07.699
He soon learns that the lab is located in
an abandoned warehouse that stores Mardi Gras

00:12:07.699 --> 00:12:09.069
floats.

00:12:09.069 --> 00:12:12.689
Damian breaks into the lab on his own and
comes across the shedding room, where he sees

00:12:12.689 --> 00:12:16.249
Anton and another man laid down on gurneys.

00:12:16.249 --> 00:12:20.170
Albright arrives and tells Damian that he
has resurrected Anton three times already,

00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:22.759
and he has become more loyal to him each time.

00:12:22.759 --> 00:12:26.680
He reveals that Madeline is being prepared
for shedding for another client, and her daughter's

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:28.810
organs will be harvested.

00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:33.079
Damian shoots Albright through the glass,
but he soon discovers that it is bulletproof.

00:12:33.079 --> 00:12:37.120
As the other guards arrive to subdue Damian,
Albright tells him that he intended to use

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:40.490
the body of a 40-year-old accountant for Anton's
shedding.

00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:44.999
But now that Damian is at the lab, he will
use Mark's body instead because his military

00:12:44.999 --> 00:12:48.220
training and hard-wired instincts have been
proven useful.

00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:53.069
While the guards struggle to restrain Damian,
he puts a bullet casing in his mouth.

00:12:53.069 --> 00:12:57.959
After the shedding process, Albright starts
asking questions to test if it was successful.

00:12:57.959 --> 00:13:02.019
When asked how many children he has, the man
smirks and says he has none.

00:13:02.019 --> 00:13:05.489
He only had pictures of kids that he downloaded
from the internet.

00:13:05.489 --> 00:13:09.379
After leaving the shedding room, he asks the
henchmen where they are keeping Madeline and

00:13:09.379 --> 00:13:10.660
her daughter.

00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:13.440
Damian kills the two guards who were watching
Madeline.

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:17.839
Meanwhile, Albright notices the bullet casing
in the shedding chamber, causing him to worry

00:13:17.839 --> 00:13:19.869
that the shedding must have failed.

00:13:19.869 --> 00:13:24.329
With guards still after them, Damian, Madeline,
and Anna end up in the viewing room next to

00:13:24.329 --> 00:13:26.449
the shedding chambers.

00:13:26.449 --> 00:13:29.899
Albright feels confident that Damian wouldn't
kill him because if he does, there will be

00:13:29.899 --> 00:13:32.239
no one to provide him with the pills.

00:13:32.239 --> 00:13:35.949
Instead, Damian looks around the room for
something he could use to smash the glass

00:13:35.949 --> 00:13:38.049
and sees the flamethrower.

00:13:38.049 --> 00:13:41.209
Damian starts reading the formula for the
drug to let Albright know that he doesn't

00:13:41.209 --> 00:13:42.679
need him anymore.

00:13:42.679 --> 00:13:47.420
He then fires up the flamethrower to burn
the bulletproof glass and kill Albright.

00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:50.589
Damian sends Madeline and Anna on their way
to the Caribbean.

00:13:50.589 --> 00:13:54.339
He then visits Claire's office and gives her
a letter, telling her what he wished he had

00:13:54.339 --> 00:13:56.819
done for her while he was still alive.

00:13:56.819 --> 00:14:00.309
After leaving the office, he looks back up
and sees Claire through the window smiling

00:14:00.309 --> 00:14:02.209
as she reads the letter.

00:14:02.209 --> 00:14:05.610
Days later, he wakes up in a room that is
unfamiliar to him.

00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:10.209
He sees a laptop on the other side of the
room and clicks the video file on the desktop.

00:14:10.209 --> 00:14:15.379
In the video, Damian addresses Mark, informing
him that he was the one who bought his body.

00:14:15.379 --> 00:14:19.589
He tells him that he's grateful that the body
has allowed him to live a few months longer.

00:14:19.589 --> 00:14:23.670
He says he has stopped taking the pills, and
he has waited days for Mark to regain control

00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:25.370
of his own body.

00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:29.639
Damian welcomes him back and asks him to take
good care of his wife and daughter.

00:14:29.639 --> 00:14:33.619
Mark soon rides a boat on the way to another
island to find Madeline and Anna.

00:14:33.619 --> 00:14:37.610
When he arrives, Madeline initially thinks
that he's Damian but soon realizes that he's

00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:40.300
Mark when she notices how he's hugging her.

00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:52.999
Madeline calls out to Anna, so she could finally
be with his father.
