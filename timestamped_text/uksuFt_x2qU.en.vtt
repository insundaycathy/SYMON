00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:07.620
Aladdin is one of my favorite films: it's
a beautifully animated, well-crafted

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.990
musical that focuses on the eponymous
Aladdin, who like a lot of Disney

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:21.000
protagonists is an orphan, however what's
curious is that although we know about

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.910
his father, we hardly know anything about
his mother so who was Aladdin's mother

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.369
and what happened to her? The first time that
we really learn anything about Aladdin's

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.780
mother is in third film of the franchise 
Aladdin and the King of Thieves

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.680
where we meet Aladdin's father Cassim,
who tells him that she died when Aladdin

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.020
was a kid sometime after Cassim had left 
his family to form the Forty Thieves.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.440
However, in the Disney comic series released from

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.469
1994 to 1995, he meets a young version of
his mother in the past after a

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.480
time-traveling adventure. At the end of
which he never realizes that the woman

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.909
he met Zena is his mom, who originally
was going to be a character in the first

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.720
film. where she was portrayed as a stout
woman that would have played a big role

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.400
in the story. In earlier versions of the
script, she was going to be what drove

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.650
Aladdin into going into the Cave of
Wonders because in that version of the

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.250
script she would have been a poor,
hard-working rug maker who would send

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.630
Aladdin to sell a rug only for him to
get swindled and come back with nothing

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.310
and with little else to sell she would
have been forced to sell her engagement

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.170
ring and this would lead up to a fight
with Aladdin getting scolded by his

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.280
mother and he would go out to reclaim
the ring during which he would sing a

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.847
song that was eventually cut from the film:
Proud of Your Boy

00:01:45.847 --> 00:01:50.840
and the sequence with the song would have followed Aladdin as he travels around Agrabah and makes a

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:56.114
promise to his mother and to himself to
be a better so

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:03.540
and the power of the Genie's lamp would have been the perfect way for Aladdin to fulfill that promise

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.780
and give her all that she could want: the
perfect life, the perfect home, and the

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:14.570
perfect son that she never had although
this would have been a point of conflict

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:18.470
between the two of them as she would
have been there when Aladdin makes his

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.000
wish to be a prince as well as in a
scene criticizing his decision to

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.010
mislead Princess Jasmine. A scene which
in the final cut of the film had the

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.260
Genie doing the criticizing. It's a shame
that all these great ideas and the song

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.040
were cut they would have added more
heart to the story and depth to

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.680
Aladdin's character. I mean a major theme
of Aladdin is this idea of wanting more

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:48.170
more respect, more freedom, to be more and
to be recognized for who you are and not

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:53.450
what you are and "Proud of Your Boy" not
only fits in perfectly with this

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:58.790
theme, it gives us insight into
Aladdin as a person it speaks to his

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.720
anxieties and although in the final cut
of the film we do have the "One Jump (Reprise)"

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.239
which fulfills a similar role it
doesn't have the same gravitas

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:12.709
even though the song and Aladdin's mother
were never in the official theatrical

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:19.240
release, these ideas retro actively
elevate Aladdin in my eyes

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:24.040
it makes me appreciate the character,
the story, and the movie as a whole

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.880
it's not just a fun little film for
kids with great production values

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:35.500
it's a film with an empathetic protagonist that
understands what that protagonist feels

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.330
and when I take into consideration all
of these things: the things that were cut

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:47.020
the things that were included, the things
that, well, never were

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:51.040
It makes me realize why story like Aladdin is so timeless

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.820
With that said, thank you so much for watching.
