00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.600
Story Recapped here. Today,&nbsp;
I'm going to explain an action,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.320
adventure, fantasy film called “Ender’s Game.”&nbsp;
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.800
Fifty years ago, an alien force known as the&nbsp;
Formics attacked Earth, killing millions of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.120
people. They avoided destruction, however, with&nbsp;
the sacrifice of Earth's greatest commander,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:21.440
Mazer Rackham. Since then, Earth has been&nbsp;
preparing for the Formics to attack by training&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:25.520
Earth's most brilliant children through war games.&nbsp;
They are placed in an academy and trained in a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.240
program that focuses on their decision-making.&nbsp;
One of them is a kid named Andrew Ender Wiggin.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.440
He is the youngest of three siblings and is&nbsp;
the only one who is currently in the program.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.360
One day, Ender is playing against&nbsp;
a random student and wins.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.720
The student is angry that he lost and&nbsp;
wants to play again, but Ender refuses.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.280
Unbeknownst to them, Colonel Hyrum&nbsp;
Graff, alongside Major Gwen Anderson,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.160
monitors the whole game, particularly Ender’s&nbsp;
perspective. Graff shows interest in Ender,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.400
thinking he has strong potential. Major Anderson&nbsp;
thinks otherwise, telling Graff that Ender may&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.040
not be a good leader. To determine this, they&nbsp;
test Ender to see how he handles rejection. They&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.200
tell Ender to head to the infirmary to remove his&nbsp;
monitor, which means that he is off the program.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.360
Ender is confused but he couldn't do anything,&nbsp;
so they remove his monitor. On the way out of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.000
infirmary, the kid from earlier and his friends&nbsp;
stop Ender and drag him to a nearby science lab.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.840
The kid, still frustrated from the loss,&nbsp;
invites Ender to a fistfight one on one,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.320
now that his monitor was gone. Ender doesn't want&nbsp;
to fight, but the kid prevents him from exiting,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.960
so Ender takes a blunt object, hits him in the&nbsp;
face, and knocks the kid down by surprise. He then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.040
follows this up by kicking the kid repeatedly&nbsp;
until the other kids tell him to stop. Ender&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.280
is still on guard while the others are stunned.&nbsp;
Ender then warns the kids not to mess with him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.040
Colonel Graff and Major Gwen are still watching&nbsp;
the whole fight, and Graff is impressed at Ender.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.240
Back home, Ender tells his older sister,&nbsp;
Valentine, that he's off the program akin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.040
to his brother Peter, who Ender fears he might&nbsp;
become like. Val tries comforting Ender by telling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.680
him otherwise. Peter shows up, frustrated at the&nbsp;
news about Ender, and invites him to a fistfight&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.240
in the form of a game. Peter ruthlessly pins&nbsp;
Ender down, choking him, and voices out his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.080
frustration of supposedly being chosen for&nbsp;
the program. He stops when Ender yields.

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.840
Later that night, the family has dinner together,&nbsp;
and Ender starts deprecating himself. The family,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.840
except Peter, comforts him. His father then&nbsp;
tells Ender that the program was challenging,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.320
so he has nothing to be ashamed of. Suddenly,&nbsp;
Colonel Graff and Major Anderson show up at their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.480
front door. They interrogate Ender about the fight&nbsp;
and why he kept kicking the kid even though he was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.960
already down. Ender replies that strategically,&nbsp;
knocking the kid down was the first fight, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.120
repeatedly kicking him wins the next ones. Colonel&nbsp;
then gets straight to the point and invites Ender&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.800
again to the program due to how tactical he&nbsp;
was about the fight. The parents do not like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.880
how the Colonel thinks about Ender's violence,&nbsp;
so the Colonel demands he speak to Ender alone.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.320
Outside the house, the Colonel tells Ender that&nbsp;
they need young people with brilliant minds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.000
like him to stop the Formics from attacking&nbsp;
forever. He further tells Ender that he will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.160
be graduating to battle school to train. Ender&nbsp;
acknowledges this as his destiny and leaves home.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.200
Ender, Graff, and Andersen arrive at the shuttle&nbsp;
to take them to the battle school in outer space.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.280
There, Ender meets his classmates. He&nbsp;
takes the seat at the back and meets Bean,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.240
and they make fun of each other's names.&nbsp;
Shortly after, the shuttle launches for space,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.720
and some students can’t handle zero gravity. Alai,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.160
one of the students, starts throwing up but not&nbsp;
before Bean immediately hands him a bag. Colonel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:13.520
Graff then enters the room to check on everyone.&nbsp;
He sees Ender smiling, so he asks him why. Ender,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.840
being smart, explains that the way the Colonel&nbsp;
floats is funny. The Colonel once again praises&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.680
him for his intelligence and tells the entire&nbsp;
class that Ender is the smartest kid in the room,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.000
attracting their attention to him. However, this&nbsp;
extra attention makes Ender feel uncomfortable.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.800
The shuttle arrives at Battle School, which is&nbsp;
a massive spaceship. The students head over to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.200
their respective rooms. Ender then checks his&nbsp;
closet and sees his suit and a type of gun.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.960
But before he could pull it&nbsp;
out, Sergeant James Dap arrives.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:42.880
Dap debriefs them condescendingly and&nbsp;
tells them to work as a team. In the class,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.880
Graff gives a speech to the students about their&nbsp;
responsibility. He then shows them the infamous&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.200
video of how Mazer Rackham sacrificed his life by&nbsp;
crashing his jet into the Formic ship, destroying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.440
it and saving humanity. The class is inspired,&nbsp;
but Ender feels something off about the video.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.680
The next day, Dap wakes the students and tells&nbsp;
them to wear their battle suits and holster&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.320
their weapons. The students then make their way to&nbsp;
the Battle Room, where Draff is waiting for them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.320
Draff tells the students that the battle room&nbsp;
has zero gravity. He then opens the room and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:13.200
lets Ender enter first. Ender enters and starts&nbsp;
floating inside, amazed about the zero gravity.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.880
The rest of the class then enters. Bean heads&nbsp;
over to Ender, and they converse about controlling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.440
their movement in zero gravity. They then wonder&nbsp;
what the weapon does, so Ender fires a test shot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.840
and proves it harmless. They then try shooting&nbsp;
each other in the leg, which freezes their leg.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.920
Ender excitingly tells Bean to try shooting him in&nbsp;
the chest resulting in his entire body freezing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.520
Shortly after, Draff pulls all&nbsp;
the students back near the gate.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.640
Draff tells them that they need to&nbsp;
compete against other teams in the school.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:40.960
He then lets Dap explain the rules of the game.&nbsp;
Dap tells them the scoring system but the ultimate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.200
win condition, regardless of the scores, is to&nbsp;
let a teammate enter the enemy gate unfrozen.

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.640
Ender writes an email to Valentine.&nbsp;
He tells her his experience at battle&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:52.080
school and how relentless their training is.&nbsp;
They have been taught hand-to-hand combat,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.320
provoking Ender's thoughts about Peter. He then&nbsp;
expresses that no one adequately talks about how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.080
Mazer Rackham actually defeated the Formics&nbsp;
and still doesn't know how the Formics think.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.600
He also expresses that the Colonel expects him to&nbsp;
be a good leader, but he doesn't know how to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:08.320
one. Ender then ends the letter by asking why she&nbsp;
doesn't write back and that he misses Valentine.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:12.480
Dap then enters the room, and with him, Graff.&nbsp;
Graff tells them that they need to work hard&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:16.320
and not think of each other as friends but&nbsp;
as competition. Out of the blue, Ender asks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:20.320
Graff if the school blocks their emails. Graff&nbsp;
confirms this and tells Ender that they don’t need&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:24.720
distractions from their families. Graff leaves,&nbsp;
but Dap is infuriated with Ender's questions,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.880
so he shouts at him and makes him do push-ups.&nbsp;
Dap tells Ender that he will never salute him, to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:33.440
which Ender replies that he definitely will soon.&nbsp;
Dap makes him do more push-ups and makes his point&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:38.160
clear. Dap then tells everyone to get some rest&nbsp;
and leaves. The rest of the class smiles at Ender.

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.080
While in bed, Ender stumbles upon&nbsp;
a game programmed by the school.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:46.400
He plays as a rat who meets a troll that lets him&nbsp;
choose from two goblets, one of which is poisoned.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.480
This wakes Alai, so he watches Ender&nbsp;
play the game. Ender tries both goblets,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:53.680
which are both poisoned, so he&nbsp;
attacks and kills the troll instead.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:58.160
Alai gets confused why, but Ender explains that&nbsp;
the academy wants to train them to be violent.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.520
Meanwhile, Graff and Andersen watch&nbsp;
him again, and upon clearing the game,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:05.840
they instantly promote him to a different team.&nbsp;
But before he heads over, Alai wishes him well.

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.960
Ender heads over to his new&nbsp;
team, the green salamanders,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:14.320
who are known for being undefeated. There he&nbsp;
meets Dink, who wonders why he's there, Petra,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:20.320
who welcomes him, and the rest. The captain,&nbsp;
Bonzo, is disappointed in Ender at first sight.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:24.160
Bonzo tries to intimidate Ender and tells him that&nbsp;
his role in the games is to be a sitting duck.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:28.880
Dink and Petra try to defend Ender, but Bonzo&nbsp;
shuts them up and dismisses Ender. Later on,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:32.320
Petra invites Ender to practice with her, so&nbsp;
they suit up and head over to the battle room.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:36.480
There, Petra teaches Ender how to aim and&nbsp;
shoot properly, showing him how it's done&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:40.240
and helping him with his posture. Ender&nbsp;
learns pretty fast, and Petra commends him.

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:45.760
The next day, Bonzo wakes his team, and they march&nbsp;
over to the battle room. Bonzo tells his team the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:50.240
plan but excludes Ender, telling him to hang back&nbsp;
by the gate and watch. The game starts, and Ender&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:55.360
spectates from the gate. However, the Salamanders&nbsp;
are losing, so Ender joins and intercepts Petra.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:59.360
The two of them devise a plan that would take&nbsp;
the enemies off guard. Petra pushes Ender,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:02.960
and he plays dead until he grabs two guns and&nbsp;
initiates a one-man attack, and thus winning&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:07.600
them the game. At the cafeteria, one of the&nbsp;
players insults Bonzo for holding Ender back.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:12.480
Later on, while Ender is training hand to hand&nbsp;
with Petra, Bonzo interrupts them. He then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:15.840
punches Ender, threatening that he would kill him&nbsp;
if he does anything to make him look stupid again.

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:20.560
Later in bed, Ender continues playing&nbsp;
the game, but something weird happens.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:24.320
The game goes on to show a desolate place&nbsp;
and a creature that morphs into Valentine.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:28.720
Valentine then proceeds to lead him into a&nbsp;
creepy mansion. There, the rat turns into Ender,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:32.720
and he sees Valentine locked inside a giant&nbsp;
crystal ball. A serpent attacks Ender,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:36.560
but he violently kills it. Then all of a&nbsp;
sudden, Peter shows up in the crystal ball,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:41.120
telling Ender that he has become a killer. This&nbsp;
scares Ender, so he stops playing the game.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:45.280
It turns out that Colonel Graff was monitoring&nbsp;
the game and is infuriated with what happened.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:49.280
Anderson tells him that she has no idea why that&nbsp;
happened, so Graff tells her to erase the game.

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:54.000
Later on, Graff calls for Ender to tell him&nbsp;
that he is doing very well. Ender tells him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.440
that he doesn’t like Bonzo, so Graff offers&nbsp;
him to be the commander of a hidden team known&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:01.200
as the Dragon Army. Dap then shows Ender to&nbsp;
his new quarters and tells him that his new&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:06.400
teammates have been notified. Ender, doubting his&nbsp;
skill, asks Dap if he thinks they'll follow him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:10.960
Dap doesn't say anything but smiles and salutes to&nbsp;
Ender. Ender heads over to meet his team, who are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:16.400
students from different teams gathered together,&nbsp;
namely: Dink, Bean, Alai, and others. Ender&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:19.840
tells them to respect each other and declares&nbsp;
that he intends to make them the best team.

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:23.200
Meanwhile, Graff is being pressed by the&nbsp;
International fleet to decide who graduates&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:27.520
from battle school, so Graff tells his men&nbsp;
to commence a sudden game. This alerts Ender,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:31.920
so he immediately wakes his team up, telling them&nbsp;
that it's game time. Due to this being sudden,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:35.920
one of the members twists their ankle, unable to&nbsp;
play, so Dink takes him to the infirmary while&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:40.240
the rest promptly head over to the battle room.&nbsp;
Ender feels that something is off, so he silently&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:44.640
checks the room first. Suddenly, Dink arrives&nbsp;
with Petra, joining Ender’s team on Graff’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:49.360
orders as a substitute. They then immediately plan&nbsp;
their attack. Ender deploys Dink as a meat shield&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:53.440
to Petra, and with her accurate aim, they wipe&nbsp;
out twelve players who were camping their gate.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:57.120
Ender then ties a rope on Bean and deploys&nbsp;
him to scout the room for other players.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:01.440
Bean spots all twenty players hiding, having&nbsp;
complete control of the area. They then fire at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:06.400
Bean, so Ender pulls Bean back at base, and Bean&nbsp;
reports the situation. They then do a formation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:10.960
that takes both teams by surprise. They use their&nbsp;
bodies to form a ship that protects Alai inside,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:13.520
and they focused on heading straight&nbsp;
for the enemy gate, winning the game.

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:19.070
While Ender is taking a shower, Bonzo, infuriated,&nbsp;
enters and invites Ender to a fistfight one on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:23.760
one. Ender tries to talk it through, but Bonzo&nbsp;
insists, so he starts running towards Ender.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:27.680
Ender then hits Bonzo with the hot water from&nbsp;
the shower and tries to make a run for it. But&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:32.800
Bonzo stops him. Ender parries Bonzo’s punches and&nbsp;
almost breaks his arm but just warns him to stop.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:36.000
Bonzo still tries to fight, but Ender&nbsp;
kicks him hard and makes him tumble,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.200
lethally breaking his spinal cord.&nbsp;
Ender panics and calls for help.

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:43.520
Ender and Petra wait outside the&nbsp;
infirmary while Bonzo is being treated.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:47.840
Anderson approaches Ender and tries sympathizing&nbsp;
with him. But Graff stops Anderson and tells her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:52.080
and Petra to leave him alone with Ender. Ender&nbsp;
asks if Bonzo is dying, but Graff tells him that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:56.640
they will send him back to Earth to recover. Ender&nbsp;
insists that he goes with Bonzo, but Graff refuses&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:01.120
to let him, so Ender tells Graff that he will&nbsp;
no longer continue training. Later on, Anderson&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:05.040
tells Graff that she will also resign, for she can&nbsp;
no longer handle the way Graff pressures Ender.

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:09.520
Back on Earth, Valentine is on her way home&nbsp;
and sees Graff's car outside the house,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:14.000
so she hurries to meet Ender but only meets Graff&nbsp;
and her mom. Graff asks Valentine to come with him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.880
to meet Ender alone. They arrive at a beach where&nbsp;
Ender was, and Valentine immediately runs to him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:22.880
Ender tells Valentine about Bonzo and expresses&nbsp;
how he thinks and truly feels when he fights,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:27.200
which Valentine fully understands. Valentine&nbsp;
then tells Ender that Graff wants him to go back,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:30.720
but Ender tells her that he won't cooperate.&nbsp;
So Valentine makes Ender understand that he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:33.600
could be the next person who saves&nbsp;
humanity and that if he doesn't try,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:37.600
they will all be lost. Ender finally understands&nbsp;
and tells Valentine that he'll miss her.

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:43.200
Graff and Ender go back to space once again.&nbsp;
Ender tells Graff never to block his emails again.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:47.040
To Ender's surprise, they won't be going back&nbsp;
to battle school, but instead, they head for the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:51.120
command base near the Formics' home planet, where&nbsp;
he'll begin his final training. They arrive on a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:55.280
Formic planet where they once drove the Formics&nbsp;
back to their home planet and established a base.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:59.200
Ender asks that if the Formic is contained in&nbsp;
their home planet, why do they even go to war.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:02.640
Graff explains that similar to how he kicked&nbsp;
the bully, they need to prevent future wars&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:06.240
from happening. Sergeant Dap then shows&nbsp;
Ender to his room, and he goes to sleep.

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:10.160
Ender hears a very familiar noise and wakes&nbsp;
up, then looks around the window to see a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:14.400
very familiar structure. He then looks away and&nbsp;
sees an old man with tattoos on his face waiting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:19.440
beside his bed. Ender is surprised and asks who&nbsp;
he is. The man ruthlessly tests Ender for a bit,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:23.040
telling him to be more discerning with his&nbsp;
enemies. The man then introduces himself to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:26.480
be the one and only Mazer Rackham,&nbsp;
which leaves Ender surprised. Ender&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:30.480
tells Mazer his concerns about the video when he&nbsp;
sacrificed his life, asking why it's incomplete.

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:35.360
Mazer shows Ender the complete video, how he used&nbsp;
the emergency parachute to escape right before he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:39.840
crashed. The video then shows that after he&nbsp;
blew up the ship, every other Formic died.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:44.080
Mazer then explains that the Formics have a&nbsp;
queen, and when the queen dies, so will the rest.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:48.080
And that's how he wiped out the entire fleet.&nbsp;
Ender asks Mazer if they have seen a queen, to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:52.640
which he responds that no one has ever seen one.&nbsp;
Mazer then takes Ender to meet his teammates Bean,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:57.600
Petra, Alai, Dink, who are happy to see him.&nbsp;
Mazer immediately debriefs them of the situation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:01.760
on the Formics' home planet. It turns out that&nbsp;
the Formics are suffering from overpopulation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:06.080
and are already unable to sustain themselves.&nbsp;
Despite that, their armies grow at an intensely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:10.240
fast pace. The Formics plan to colonize more&nbsp;
planets, and their mission is to defeat them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:14.400
before it's too late. The training will consist&nbsp;
of photo-real simulations of battles in which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:18.320
Ender will command the overall strategy while&nbsp;
his team commands battle groups. They must also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:22.080
protect his most important asset, a ship known&nbsp;
as the "Little Doctor," fully weaponized to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:25.760
cause a chain reaction of disintegration, which&nbsp;
will wipe out an entire swarm with one shot.

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:29.920
Ender and his team begin training with&nbsp;
the simulations. But each simulation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:32.000
becomes more and more complex and accurate.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.280
They are pressured to win day after&nbsp;
day for months and start losing sleep.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:39.520
In one simulation, Ender tries micro-managing&nbsp;
everything, and they get swarmed, failing the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:44.720
simulation. Mazer gets angry at Ender, telling him&nbsp;
that they can't keep losing at an unforgiving war.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:48.240
Mazer then tells Ender that he has trained&nbsp;
failures in the past, but Ender will be the last.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:52.640
Graff tells him that there's no more time, so&nbsp;
Ender's final simulation will have to be tomorrow.

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:57.680
That night, Ender wonders how the Formics think.&nbsp;
He speaks with Petra and shares his thoughts,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:01.760
curious about communication with the formics.&nbsp;
Petra tells him it's impossible and insists that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:05.920
they sleep for the final simulation. Ender&nbsp;
agrees, and they bid each other goodnight.

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:09.840
The next day comes, and Ender heads over to&nbsp;
the battle room to meet his teammates. There,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:13.360
the superiors will be spectating their&nbsp;
simulation. Graff tells him that they will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:16.720
promote him to battle commander if they&nbsp;
are victorious in the final simulation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:20.080
Mazer tells them that the final simulation&nbsp;
will be staged at the Formic home planet and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:24.960
wishes them good luck. Ender and his team begin&nbsp;
the simulation. Immediately, they see a fleet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:26.720
of Formic ships waiting for them. Ender tells&nbsp;
Petra to fire the Little Doctor immediately. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:31.280
then commands Alai to engage, causing the Formic&nbsp;
fleet to start swarming. Petra then fires at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:35.440
center and wipes out the entire fleet. But this&nbsp;
prompts the Formics to send their entire army,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:40.240
a massive fleet from the planet, to attack them.&nbsp;
Petra needs minutes to recharge, so Ender commands&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:44.720
all drones to gather around the Little Doctor,&nbsp;
forming a shield. Ender abandons the entire rest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:48.320
of the fleet and tells Petra to head straight&nbsp;
for the planet. They are heavily overwhelmed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:52.080
by the swarm and are entering the atmosphere&nbsp;
burning the shield faster with the heat. Petra&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:56.400
still doesn't have a clear shot, so Ender commands&nbsp;
Bean's drones to clear up the front for a shot.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:59.280
They are now running out of time until&nbsp;
amidst the heat of the battle, the Little&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:03.280
Doctor finished recharging, and Petra shoots the&nbsp;
planet, destroying every living creature in it.

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:07.440
They then celebrate their success until Graff&nbsp;
shows them the planet again and tells Ender that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:11.760
they already won the war and that the simulation&nbsp;
was real all along. Ender committed genocide and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:15.920
destroyed the entire Formic fleet. Ender cannot&nbsp;
grasp the terror of what he did and walks out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:19.920
of the room in disgust. Graff tries to approach&nbsp;
him, but Ender yells at telling him that they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:24.080
could've been more reasonable. Graff argues that&nbsp;
all that matters is that they won, and Ender&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:28.240
will be remembered as a hero. But Ender angrily&nbsp;
refutes Graff, telling him that he will bear the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:32.240
shame of the genocide forever and that the way&nbsp;
they win is what matters. Ender walks away, but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:36.320
they sedate him and take him to his room. Petra&nbsp;
stays with Ender so that he may not feel alone.

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:40.400
While asleep, Ender dreams about the game and&nbsp;
everything he ever thought about the Formics&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:44.560
until he came to a conclusion. He immediately&nbsp;
wakes up and runs towards the exit of the base,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:49.200
and Petra chases him. Petra takes an oxygen&nbsp;
bag and gives one to Ender outside. Ender&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:53.200
explains that the familiar structure was from the&nbsp;
game. It turns out that the Formics were able to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:56.720
access the game to try and communicate&nbsp;
to Ender. Petra tells Ender to stop,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:56.720 --> 00:15:00.560
but he convinces her that he has to go. So&nbsp;
she let Ender make his way for the structure.

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:05.200
Ender finds himself in a Formic hive,&nbsp;
and deep inside, he sees a living egg.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:08.240
And guarding the egg was the queen, the&nbsp;
last of the Formics, the creature from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:12.480
the game. The queen surprisingly understands&nbsp;
Ender's sentiments and wipes his tears. Ender&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:16.480
understands that the queen is dying and that all&nbsp;
she wants to do now is prevent their extinction.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:19.520
Ender promises the queen that he will find&nbsp;
a new home for the egg and preserve them.

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:23.680
Ender writes to Valentine one last time, telling&nbsp;
her everything that had happened and what he will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:28.400
do to make amends. He tells her that he misses&nbsp;
her so much, but he won't be back for a while.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:32.000
The superiors awarded Ender the rank of&nbsp;
admiral, letting him do what he wants.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.160
Ender uses this opportunity to take a ship and&nbsp;
his precious cargo with him. Ender must now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:39.840
travel the universe in search of a new home&nbsp;
for the Formics and carry out his promise.
