00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.520
Story Recapped here. Today I'm going to show you&nbsp;
a science fiction action film titled District 9.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.560
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care!

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.600
A TV documentary discloses a series of&nbsp;
interviews taking its audience on a trip&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:18.640
down the memory lane about Wikus, the MNU&nbsp;
operative and a starship carrying 1.8 million&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:24.240
extraterrestrial creatures from two decades ago.
A starship shocks humans as it brings itself to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.960
standstill mid-air at the city of Johannesburg in&nbsp;
South Africa instead of stopping at Washington,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.320
Manhattan, and Chicago. News around the planet&nbsp;
reports that the starship stays afloat for three&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.520
months without interfering with the humans down&nbsp;
below. With the lingering curiosity and argument,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.440
humans eventually unbolt the gates of the&nbsp;
spaceship and discover a population of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.000
deceased and malnourished extraterrestrials.&nbsp;
Humans think it is going to be a historical&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.480
encounter and a scientific breakthrough. The&nbsp;
humans, concluding that their leaders may&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.680
have died of malnutrition and disease, enslave&nbsp;
the aliens who, in any realm of possibility,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.840
could not go back to their home planet because&nbsp;
of an irretrievable starship command module.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.720
After some time, the government permits the&nbsp;
creatures to abandon their ship and relocate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.000
them into a chronic area in a barren military&nbsp;
compound with congested cabins in Johannesburg.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.680
The residents claim that the government&nbsp;
strictly ensures the absolute separation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.560
of aliens and humans in Johannesburg. Still,&nbsp;
their efforts went for nothing because the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.600
Nigerians feel tired of the lack of civilization&nbsp;
and humanity among the extraterrestrial creatures,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.840
who operate their unique arms to steal and&nbsp;
kill whoever goes against their instincts.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.640
The Nigerians denominate them as prawns as&nbsp;
they settle in consuming garbage. They lament&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.720
that the aliens take everything in Johannesburg&nbsp;
into their possession and turn it into ruins.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.880
The extraterrestrials took Johannesburg upside&nbsp;
down with robbery, arson, rape, and murder,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.200
adding turmoil to the already miserable place&nbsp;
where militarization and lawlessness prevailed.

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.200
In the middle of chaos and&nbsp;
dystopia, Multi-National United,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.760
a private company that builds and sells weapons&nbsp;
of destruction, enters into an agreement with the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:03.440
government to reduce District 9 to ruins to coerce&nbsp;
the aliens to transfer into a more habitable area.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:08.640
The government plans to restore tranquility,&nbsp;
pacification, and order among humans and aliens.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.240
MNU is instructed to do its job by evicting the&nbsp;
whole population of aliens using a legalized&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.360
UIU protocol. MNU appoints the primary role&nbsp;
of the demolition to Wikus van der Merwe,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.840
a smart man with a gentle disposition.&nbsp;
Wikus is a loving husband to her wife,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:29.520
whose father works as the head of the command in&nbsp;
MNU. Wikus, assisted by Koobus Venter, the head of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.960
the military operations, regulates the demolition&nbsp;
and eviction at District 9. He feels oddly and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:39.360
awkwardly optimistic about the demolition that&nbsp;
before they started deploying, Wikus starts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.000
questioning the military operatives about the&nbsp;
unnecessary load of bullets in their pockets. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.280
forces head-on convoy to District 9 using military&nbsp;
trucks and airplanes, and even before their first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.640
diplomatic agreement, they met hostile and violent&nbsp;
extraterrestrials on the way. Even though Koobus&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.720
and his troops believe in an armed eviction,&nbsp;
Wikus pursues to make it diplomatic despite&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.680
the hostility of the aliens. His team’s violent&nbsp;
correspondence subsequently killed most of their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.480
men. While serving the warrants and searching&nbsp;
for illegal items inside the pods of the prawns,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:14.240
Wikus encounters a warlord named Obesanjo, who&nbsp;
markets interspecies prostitution, cat food, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:19.760
weapons to the aliens for their survival. After&nbsp;
passing by Obesanjo’s territory, Wikus’ team found&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:25.200
a shack with millions of alien offspring fed off a&nbsp;
dead cow’s protein. Wikus continues their eviction&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.000
with all the remaining aliens in the area, and the&nbsp;
documentary team records a child testifying that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.120
the weapons were small but destructive enough.&nbsp;
Later on in the documentary, an analyst claims&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.120
that the MNU took the contract because they&nbsp;
were primarily drawn to the lethal force of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.880
their weapons. Still, the MNU had to study alien&nbsp;
DNA for that biologically designed war craft.&nbsp;

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.320
Meanwhile, Obesanjo’s gang roams around the&nbsp;
demolition area holding a firearm party,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:55.360
making the aliens more agitated and hostile.&nbsp;
Wikus and Koobus unexpectedly end up in front&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:00.560
of the shack of starship pilots, where Koobus ends&nbsp;
up killing one of the pilots. Wikus is able to get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.120
inside the hut, where he meets Christopher,&nbsp;
the only living pilot of the alien race.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.680
He finds a cylinder that contains a black fluid&nbsp;
that subsequently sprays a volume into his face.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:15.200
He jolts uncomfortably as he wipes the fluid&nbsp;
dry from his face. After he redeems himself&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.760
from the pain and nauseating effect, he keeps the&nbsp;
cylinder with the liquid in his vest for evidence.

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.880
Wikus grows indisposed and sick while&nbsp;
returning to the office after the demolition.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:30.080
He discovers unusual changes in his hands. As&nbsp;
horror-stricken as he is, he forges home to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.560
deliver the news to his wife but ends up fainting&nbsp;
at the surprise party that she has thrown for him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.720
She brings him to the hospital, where&nbsp;
the doctors report to the MNU that his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.040
arm has mutated with that of the prawns.&nbsp;
Her attention is called by a group of men&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:47.200
who wraps his vulnerable husband in a special&nbsp;
suit and seizes him while she hyperventilates.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:52.800
The MNU undertakes a series of tests with Wikus’&nbsp;
body and eventually retrieves the cylinder of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:58.240
black fluid in his coat. By then, they suspect&nbsp;
that Wikus is becoming treacherous against MNU for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.640
not submitting the cylinder to the lab. The head&nbsp;
scientist confirms beyond doubt that the alien&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:08.560
DNA has finally taken over his veins, muscles, and&nbsp;
half of Wikus’ body functions. The flabbergasted&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.800
Wikus struggles with all his might and resists&nbsp;
the experiment, but his father-in-law decides&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.840
to capture all the alien material from his body.&nbsp;
Wikus musters his strength back and escapes from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:24.000
the MNU lab. He attempts to return home but finds&nbsp;
MNU agents there. He miserably runs across the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.280
city as a citywide manhunt is being held against&nbsp;
him. He finds temporary refuge in the slums of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:34.880
District 9, where he idles his night away. In the&nbsp;
morning, he comes across the familiar shack where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:40.000
Christopher and his little son reside. He comes&nbsp;
inside and is dumbfounded to see several computers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.800
reading incomprehensible code. He concludes that&nbsp;
Christopher is one of the alien’s leaders and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:49.840
works underground the shack to make the command&nbsp;
module work. Christopher reveals to the poor Wikus&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:54.560
that he can help him go back to the human state&nbsp;
using the black fluid he confiscated days ago, but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:59.520
Wikus has to compromise to help Christopher fuel&nbsp;
up the engine. Wikus admits to Christopher that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:04.320
the lab took the black liquid from him when he was&nbsp;
captured. Christopher feels hopeless as they don&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:09.920
have any weapons to ransack MNU. Wikus remembers&nbsp;
Obesanjo and sprints there with Christopher.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:14.640
They hit upon a group of men mocking Wikus for&nbsp;
allegedly engaging sexually with an alien, but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:20.880
after losing focus, Wikus manages to steal alien&nbsp;
weapons from Obesanjo's camp. Obesanjo curses him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:25.200
and shouts a promise to take revenge and eat his&nbsp;
mutated arm for power when he meets them again.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.560
Wikus and Christopher triumphantly transgress&nbsp;
against MNU’s headquarters and steer to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:35.200
laboratory, where they begin their search for&nbsp;
the cylinder. Christopher loses his focus on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:39.840
retrieving the cylinder after seeing the remains&nbsp;
of his race in the laboratory. Christopher&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:44.800
and Wikus end up fighting after satisfactorily&nbsp;
taking the cylinder and returning to their shack.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:48.800
Wikus ends up knocking him over and runs&nbsp;
the engine of the command module himself.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:52.960
The military operatives raze one of&nbsp;
the engines to the ground after a blow,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.200
and Wikus collides together&nbsp;
with the command module.

00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:01.360
The MNU operatives, which Koobus led, arrest&nbsp;
Wikus, but Obesanjo’s gang takes over Wikus&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:06.400
after defeating the MNU operatives. Believing that&nbsp;
eating a limb will give him destructive powers,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:11.440
Obesanjo orders his gang to shear Wikus’ arm.&nbsp;
While that is happening, Christopher’s son&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:16.160
operates the command module and sets a mechanical&nbsp;
suit that attacks Obesanjo and his gang.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:21.280
As Wickus is set free, he enters the battle suit&nbsp;
and comes to rescue Christopher from the MNU.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:25.360
He activates all the destructive features of the&nbsp;
battle suit and starts to slaughter the rest of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:30.000
the armed men. He collapses with a sniper’s&nbsp;
blow and begs Christopher to move back to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.560
ship’s module. Christopher objects but without&nbsp;
a choice, he leaves and promises to come back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:40.080
to reinstate Wikus’ body. Christopher and his son&nbsp;
victoriously leave Johannesburg with the starship,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:44.160
and the humans watch in awe and satisfaction&nbsp;
as it ascends out of their sight.

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:49.200
Meanwhile, the mechanical suit ejected Wikus&nbsp;
after being disfigured. He quietly drags his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:53.680
aching body away from the suit until Koobus&nbsp;
appears and enervates his powerless body.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:57.520
Koobus contemplates bringing him&nbsp;
back to MNU but opts to shoot him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:01.600
He was about to pull the trigger when other&nbsp;
prawns emerge to Wikus’ salvage and dislimb him.

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:06.720
Later that year, analysts and Wikus’ family and&nbsp;
friends confide to the documentary about the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:11.360
possible whereabouts of Wikus, who has long&nbsp;
disappeared. They conclude that Wikus must&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:16.480
have been hiding in the mother ship or was held&nbsp;
captive by MNU and the government. The documentary&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:21.360
also shows that Wikus’ workmates exposed MNU’s&nbsp;
biological corruptions and system anomalies.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.560
Finally, it shows Wikus’ wife holding a metal rose&nbsp;
which she claims to have been left by Wikus on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:31.280
their doorstep. Her speculation could have been&nbsp;
confirmed as his husband, who loves making her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:36.560
handmade gifts, sits on a junkyard in Johannesburg&nbsp;
while holding a metal rose, completely mutated.
