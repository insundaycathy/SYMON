00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:01.899
Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.899 --> 00:00:06.669
Today I'm going to show you a drama, thriller,
sci-fi film called “Replicas.”

00:00:06.669 --> 00:00:08.109
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:10.450
Watch out and take care.

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:14.410
Biomedical research scientist Bill Foster
works at Bionyne, trying to transfer human

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:16.309
consciousness to robots.

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.160
He and his colleague Ed head the project and
get a call for a newly deceased soldier that

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.780
comes in as a donor.

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:26.660
They rush the soldier into their laboratory
and start the process to transfer his consciousness.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.570
By injecting a needle into the eye, Bill maps
the human brain and uploads it to the robot.

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:36.450
Bill begins the imprinting procedure manually
by using a holographic interface.

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.300
After a successful transfer, the team prepares
to awaken the robot.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.130
The robot goes online, and Bill asks if he
knows what’s happening.

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.120
The robot looks around but starts freaking
out, shouting and screaming, asking to know

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.430
who he is.

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.490
Bill tries to calm the robot down, but it
starts tearing itself apart.

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.290
Bill is left with no choice but to pull the
plug.

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.160
Bill goes to talk to his boss, Jones, and
tells him they’re gaining more progress

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.489
as the robot now, for the first time, speaks.

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:07.820
Jones is unimpressed as, according to their
timeframe, they should be much farther ahead

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.140
with the project.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.810
Jones tells Bill they don’t have much time
before the higher-ups shut their department

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.020
down.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.350
Bill heads home to his wife Mona and their
children Sophie, Matt, and Zoe.

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.401
The family prepares for a weekend getaway
boat trip, and Ed comes in, to house sit.

00:01:22.401 --> 00:01:28.170
Ed and Bill talk about the project’s progress,
and he tells him about what Jones said earlier.

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.270
Mona overhears and expresses her concerns
about the ethical implications of their experiments.

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.200
Bill counters that actual scientific progress
requires sacrifice.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.119
Bill then cites the times Mona had to bring
people back to life but Mona reasons out that

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:43.630
her patients don’t tear themselves apart.

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.060
Mona worries that Bill could slowly start
to have a distorted view of what it means

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.340
to be human and to be alive, but Bill assures
her everything will be fine.

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.580
During the ride to the pier, the family runs
into a heavy rainstorm.

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.990
Bill’s vision becomes extremely limited,
and the family almost collides head-on with

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:00.299
a semi-truck.

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.410
Bill successfully swerves away from the semi
only to run into a fallen tree.

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.180
A branch impales Mona’s stomach, and Bill
loses control of the car.

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:11.299
They run off the road and crash into a river.

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:14.269
Bill regains consciousness and sees Mona is
dead.

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:17.269
He checks on his children and sees they’re
all underwater.

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:21.000
Bill struggles to get his drowned family out
of the water and lays them down on the river

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000
bank.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.999
He weeps, caressing his family’s lifeless
bodies.

00:02:24.999 --> 00:02:28.760
While cradling Mona’s corpse, Bill gets
a revelation and dials Ed.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.999
Bill heads to the roadside and waves down
a confused Ed.

00:02:31.999 --> 00:02:34.969
They unload the brain mapping equipment, and
Bill leads the way.

00:02:34.969 --> 00:02:39.049
Ed is terrified to see the Foster family lying
dead and immediately understands what Bill

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:40.469
intends to do.

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:44.409
Ed disagrees and wants to call the police
but does it anyway, with little convincing

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:45.559
from Bill.

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:49.120
They take the family’s brains, map them,
and store them.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.260
The pair heads back into Bionyne and goes
to Ed’s office, intending to collect cloning

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:54.260
equipment.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.519
Ed tells Bill that Bionyne can clone animals,
but human cloning is banned.

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:03.109
Ed warns that the cloning process is not perfected,
and previous animal clones have come back

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:04.109
defective.

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:07.809
Regardless, Bill is still determined to go
through with his plan.

00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:11.780
Ed then agrees to meet Bill at the Foster
residence with the cloning pods.

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.079
Bill is surprised to see that Ed has only
brought the company’s three cloning pods.

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:19.790
Bill needs four pods, but Ed tells him this
is all the company has.

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.389
Bill is then left with a tough decision to
leave one of his children out of the cloning

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:24.430
procedure.

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.409
He places their names in a bowl and picks
one name as the child he won’t clone.

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:32.709
He’s incredibly distraught to see it’s
the youngest Zoe who would stay dead.

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:35.659
In the basement, Bill and Ed set up the cloning
pods.

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:39.769
Ed informs Bill that the cloning process is
exceptionally delicate, and the pods must

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:41.260
never lose power.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.519
Bill then goes to steal every car battery
from the neighborhood.

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:49.319
The cloning process would take 17 days, and
Bill has until then to figure out how to successfully

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:52.189
transfer the family’s consciousness to the
clones.

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:56.029
Ed asks what he intends to do about Zoe’s
situation, and Bill tells him he’ll have

00:03:56.029 --> 00:03:58.829
to delete all of the family’s memories of
Zoe.

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:02.579
The following day, Bill begins work on the
brain mapping and deletes all the memories

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:04.589
the family had of Zoe.

00:04:04.589 --> 00:04:09.290
Back at Bionyne, Jones informs Ed that if
they don’t successfully transfer human consciousness

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.489
into a robot, they’ll be forced to shut
the project down.

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:16.269
Ed calls Bill, telling him that the company
will have to liquidize their equipment if

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:17.840
they get shut down.

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.829
This would then reveal that they’ve stolen
the cloning pods.

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:24.819
Bill then orders Ed to keep watch over the
clones so they can exchange places.

00:04:24.819 --> 00:04:29.009
Bill heads to Bionyne and immediately gets
quizzed by Jones and fellow employees about

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:30.810
the project’s progress.

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.590
He then sees a miniature cutout horse Zoe
made.

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.409
He then heads back to his house, where he
runs into Matt’s teacher, who stopped by

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:40.360
to ask where Matt has been for the past several
days.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.650
The teacher tells Bill that Ed already informed
her that Matt has chickenpox.

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.560
Bill realizes that his family has individual
lives and social circles.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.169
They’d probably be wondering at this point
where the family has been.

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:55.800
He then goes through their devices and accesses
their social accounts.

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.870
He makes up excuses for everyone, ranging
from being grounded to being sick.

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:04.120
Bill continues to work on trying to transfer
the family’s consciousness, but the simulations

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.419
keep failing.

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:10.210
The 17 days are now up, and he still has no
idea how to perfect the process.

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:14.479
Ed tells Bill that the clones can’t be kept
in the pods for too long as they’ll continue

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:16.419
to age and grow exponentially.

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:20.520
If they don’t get the clones out now, they
could age years within just a few hours.

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.050
Bill then decides to take the clones out and
sedate them for a few days while he tries

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:26.139
to fix the imprinting procedure.

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:29.560
Ed warns him that he can’t find a way to
improve the imprinting, then he’ll have

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.610
to kill the clones.

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:36.289
Several days pass, and Bill still doesn’t
have the answer to fixing the imprinting process.

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:38.789
He then now has to euthanize the clones.

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:43.849
He begins with Mona, and as he’s about to
inject her, he grabs her hand, and brain activity

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:44.849
spikes.

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:48.070
Ed arrives, and Bill is ecstatic about his
discovery.

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:51.560
Bill tells Ed that the imprinting process
has been failing as the brain knows that the

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.240
body they are in is not theirs.

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:57.790
That’s why, he argues, that the robot tried
to destroy itself.

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:00.060
The brain knew that it wasn’t in its body.

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:04.710
To combat this, Bill has to rewrite an algorithm
in the system, fooling the brain into thinking

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:07.880
that the body they’re being uploaded into
is their own body.

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.880
This is how they’ll solve the problem of
transferring consciousness to the robots.

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:15.570
As for the family, Bill theorizes that the
process will work flawlessly as he’ll be

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:18.749
transferring the consciousness into their
own bodies.

00:06:18.749 --> 00:06:22.830
Bill and Ed initiate the transfer on Mona,
and everything runs smoothly.

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:26.030
They complete the imprint, and Mona starts
convulsing.

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:28.530
After a while, she stops and wakes up.

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:32.190
Bill has to put her to sleep again as he has
to clean the house and erase all evidence

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:33.539
of the procedure.

00:06:33.539 --> 00:06:38.919
Ed is out of his mind, babbling and delighted,
as they’ve just fully cloned a human being.

00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:43.340
Bill cleans up and tries to get everything
in the house as close to normal as possible.

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:47.000
He erases all evidence that Zoe ever existed
and heads to bed.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.590
The following morning, he wakes up to the
family having breakfast.

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:54.600
Bill is pleased to see everyone back alive,
and he has breakfast with them.

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:58.160
He does, however, notice a few strange behaviors.

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:01.379
Matt places too much food on his plate and
spills some milk.

00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:05.599
Mona goes out for a run and feels a strange
sensation where the original Mona got impaled

00:07:05.599 --> 00:07:07.090
with a branch.

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:11.430
Ed calls Bill and tells him they have a new
donor, and they have to rush to the lab.

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:13.979
Bill arrives, and they begin the process.

00:07:13.979 --> 00:07:18.650
Bill sees that the soldier’s brain is too
far gone and decides to cancel the imprinting.

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:22.210
He tells Ed that his conscience won’t allow
him to put another person into the machine

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:23.979
and make it suffer.

00:07:23.979 --> 00:07:27.889
Bill then decides to make a copy of his own
brain and place that into the robot.

00:07:27.889 --> 00:07:32.240
He heads to the bathroom, puts on the headgear,
and has a needle stab him in the eye to initiate

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:33.819
the brain mapping.

00:07:33.819 --> 00:07:38.520
After the grueling process, Bill meets back
with Ed, and they talk about the new plan.

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:41.771
Bill says that the process will have a much
better chance with his mind as he’ll be

00:07:41.771 --> 00:07:43.449
able to ask the robot.

00:07:43.449 --> 00:07:46.189
He says he’ll start writing the algorithm
later that evening.

00:07:46.189 --> 00:07:51.050
At home, Mona tells Bill that she feels something
wrong as she has no recollection of what’s

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:53.159
happened in the past several days.

00:07:53.159 --> 00:07:56.759
Bill tells her maybe she’s sick and that
she should perhaps take a rest.

00:07:56.759 --> 00:08:00.970
In the basement, Bill begins writing the algorithm
to trick the imprinted brain into accepting

00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:02.810
the robot body.

00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:06.460
Sophie wakes up from a nightmare, and Bill
rushes in to comfort her.

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:10.069
Sophie says she had a nightmare where her
mother dies, but Bill assures her that it

00:08:10.069 --> 00:08:11.580
was all a dream.

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:15.900
Sophie goes back to sleep, and Bill carries
her to the basement to rework her brain.

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:19.659
He deletes more subconscious memories of Zoe
from Sophie’s brain.

00:08:19.659 --> 00:08:22.930
Mona walks in as he’s working and demands
to know the truth.

00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:25.900
With no coercion, Bill confesses the truth.

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:29.930
He tells her that they’ve all died in a
car crash, and they are clones.

00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:33.589
Mona demands Bill takes the equipment off
of Sophie, and they head back to the living

00:08:33.589 --> 00:08:34.589
room.

00:08:34.589 --> 00:08:38.320
Mona is in shock, realizing she’s died and
she’s a copy.

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:42.469
Bill tells her that what matters is she’s
alive, and he loves her just as much.

00:08:42.469 --> 00:08:45.810
Their family is here, and Bill says he’ll
do anything to keep them.

00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:50.750
At dinner, Sophie asks who Zoe is as she’s
seen the name written in her closet.

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:54.950
Mona also feels something is wrong and tells
Bill she remembers a bunk bed in Sophie’s

00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:57.339
bedroom too, but it’s not there anymore.

00:08:57.339 --> 00:09:01.410
Jones gives the family a surprise visit, and
he and Bill step out to talk.

00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:04.880
Jones reveals that he’s found out about
the clones and tells Bill that the clones

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:06.500
need to be eliminated.

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:10.560
Bill tries to bargain, offering the algorithm
in exchange for the family.

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:14.980
He argues this would make Bionyne an incredibly
successful biomedical company.

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:19.190
Jones laughs this off and asks Bill if he
still believes Bionyne is an actual medical

00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:20.190
company.

00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:24.880
He tells him nobody would pay a considerable
amount of money just to revive a dead soldier.

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:29.399
He reveals that Bionyne is, and always has
been, a military contractor.

00:09:29.399 --> 00:09:33.680
The imprinting of consciousness in a robot
isn’t for revival but for creating a robotized

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:34.680
army.

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:39.120
The company’s primary goal is to place the
best soldiers, the best pilots, and the best

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:42.220
analytical brains into thousands of robots
for war.

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:46.610
Jones then offers Bill a chance to say goodbye
to his family before they are taken.

00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:51.260
Bill then retrieves the algorithm, but as
he hands it to Jones, he stabs him with sedative,

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:52.890
and Jones falls.

00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:56.800
Bill rushes in and tells the family people
from Bionyne are after them.

00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:00.010
Bill places the algorithm copy in the microwave
destroying it.

00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:03.130
Bill also ends up telling the truth to Mona
about Zoe.

00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:07.930
He tells Mona she can get angry at him for
everything, but first, they have to escape.

00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:10.350
They sneak past the guards and drive away.

00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:14.540
The guards give chase, able to track them
via implants in their spines.

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:18.560
Mona gets an idea to disable the trackers,
so they head to her clinic.

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:22.680
She places the kids on a table and uses a
defibrillator to shock them and destroy the

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:23.680
implants.

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:26.759
The Bionyne goons catch up and track them
to the building.

00:10:26.759 --> 00:10:31.660
They go through the rooms, but the trackers
disappear one by one, and the family escapes.

00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:34.610
Bill then plans to escape using the boat at
the pier.

00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:38.139
He goes in to see if the keys are in and leaves
the family in the car.

00:10:38.139 --> 00:10:41.160
Unfortunately, Bionyne henchmen arrive and
take the family.

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:44.680
At Bionyne, Mona and Ed are interrogated.

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:48.460
Ed tells her that he had no choice but to
admit everything to Jones.

00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:52.600
Bill arrives and tries again to negotiate,
but Jones shoots Ed and threatens to shoot

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:53.600
Mona.

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:57.660
Bill is left with no choice but to give them
another copy of the algorithm for the successful

00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:00.220
brain mapping and imprinting procedure.

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:04.910
Little did Jones know, Bill was not only creating
the algorithm, but he was also uploading his

00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:08.010
consciousness to the experimental robot at
the lab.

00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:12.300
By the time Bill finishes the algorithm, the
robot comes online.

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:16.670
Bill hands the algorithm to Jones, but the
robot with Bill’s consciousness arrives.

00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:20.279
A shootout occurs, but the robot disables
everyone.

00:11:20.279 --> 00:11:25.470
Mona and Bill escape with the kids, but before
driving away, Bill goes back into Bionyne.

00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:28.690
He sees the robot killing Jones and orders
it to stop.

00:11:28.690 --> 00:11:32.820
Bill approaches Jones, but Jones tells him
that Bionyne would simply send more men after

00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:34.370
him and the family.

00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:38.790
Bill offers a deal: Bionyne lets them go free,
and he’ll give them the knowledge for successful

00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:40.120
human cloning.

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:41.459
Jones agrees.

00:11:41.459 --> 00:11:45.649
The robot offers to remain with Jones to make
more clones and tells Bill to leave and take

00:11:45.649 --> 00:11:47.510
care of the family.

00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:52.060
Seventeen days pass, and the Foster family
is enjoying a beautiful day at the beach.

00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:56.880
Bill joins Mona and the kids, along with a
young Zoe, fresh from the cloning pod.

00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:01.230
In Dubai, Jones meets with a rich older man,
paralyzed in a wheelchair.

00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:14.640
Jones is offered money, and they step into
a room where the robot waits to initiate the

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:15.210
cloning process.
