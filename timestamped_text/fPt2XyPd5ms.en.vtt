00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.520
A boy enters an abandoned farmhouse, looking&nbsp;
for his friend but He only finds some webbing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.320
inside. Following some tracks, he picks&nbsp;
up a large bug’s leg from the ground.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.360
He seems aware that impending danger is on the&nbsp;
horizon as a giant shadow is heading towards him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.640
What is this creature that’s causing so&nbsp;
much concern? This is Movie Shortens. Follow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.680
us today to a movie title: Eight Legged&nbsp;
Freaks. Be aware, there are spoilers!
&nbsp;

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:32.000
The movie starts in the early morning hours of a&nbsp;
quiet mining town. The voice of a local radio DJ,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.760
Harlan is doing his job and waking people up.&nbsp;
Meanwhile cruising down a highway, a dozing truck&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:43.040
driver is carrying a load of chemicals when he&nbsp;
swerves to dodge a rabbit. This sends one of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:49.040
toxic barrels of waste into a reservoir. Near&nbsp;
the site, a farmer of the exotic spider kind,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:54.400
Joshua or “Josh" collects crickets for his&nbsp;
spiders. He is completely unaware of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.360
barrel spreading poison all over the pond.
A week later, little Mike, who also shares the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.240
hobby of spider collecting, makes a regular&nbsp;
visit to his friend Josh. Entering the farm,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:09.920
Mike takes a look at the spiders, which have grown&nbsp;
a considerable amount since he last saw them.  
&nbsp;

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.680
Confused, a large spider jumps&nbsp;
onto the glass scaring Mike.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.200
Just then, Josh appears and welcomes Mike back.&nbsp;
As Mike mentions the size of his favorite spider,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.000
Josh shares his discovery of what seem to&nbsp;
be magic crickets which he thinks are spider&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.800
steroids. Josh truly believes he is going&nbsp;
to make a fortune off of it. While looking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.280
at the jumping spiders, the two are unaware&nbsp;
that a tarantula has escaped from its cage.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.520
Josh continues showing Mike an enormous female&nbsp;
orb-weaver he calls Consuela as she cocoons her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:45.040
prey. The alarm rings, signaling that Mike needs&nbsp;
to leave for school. He tells Josh that he will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.520
visit again the following week and he hopes the&nbsp;
spiders will be double the size they are now. 
&nbsp;

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.560
As Mike leaves, Josh quickly realizes&nbsp;
the tarantula is missing. It turns out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.760
the spider is on his back. He is bitten in the&nbsp;
neck and accidentally knocks into some cages&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.760
while struggling with his ordeal. He is&nbsp;
killed from the bite, and the remaining&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.880
arachnids are released in the process. 
A week later, Mike again goes to visit Josh,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:14.320
but soon is confronted by his mother, Sam ,&nbsp;
an unmarried police officer. She asks Mike&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:19.040
not to wander around while she and a colleague&nbsp;
named Pete are inspecting the contaminated area.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:24.480
Mike says that he needs to inform Joshua about&nbsp;
the pond, however Sam states that she doesn’t&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.440
like him hanging out with Josh as he keeps&nbsp;
dangerous spiders around. The boy is told to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.680
take the bike and to follow his mother home.
On the way to town, they come across a group&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:39.120
of teens on dirt bikes. Sam decides to stop the&nbsp;
group, soon realizing that her daughter, Ashley,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.200
is amongst the group. The girl is&nbsp;
then required to get in the truck.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.440
Sam gives Bret, Ashley’s troubled boyfriend,&nbsp;
a ticket and leaves with her children.
&nbsp;

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.200
At night, Mike becomes more concerned as Josh&nbsp;
isn’t picking up his phone. A quick transition&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.640
shows that the farm is now covered in spider webs&nbsp;
and Josh is no longer with us. At the local mall,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.440
Mayor Wade is holding a meeting to decide whether&nbsp;
they should sell gold mines and turn the quarry&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:08.320
into a commercial complex. Chris, the owner of&nbsp;
the mines and whose father died a few years back.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:14.000
He shows up disagreeing with the authorities.&nbsp;
He tells Wade that he’ll never sell the mines.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.480
The two get into a fight, and Sam has to&nbsp;
constrain Chris. It is now revealed that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.920
the two of them have a secret crush on&nbsp;
each other going back some years.
&nbsp;

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.760
The following morning, Mike realizes&nbsp;
his bike has been locked up by Sam.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.120
Ashley has a fight with Sam, and Chris shows up&nbsp;
at the door, attempting to make up with Sam after&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.720
years of being gone. Mike takes advantage of this&nbsp;
by sneaking out of the house to find Joshua.  
&nbsp;

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.280
Running to the farm, Mike learns the spiders&nbsp;
are gone and there are spiderwebs everywhere.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.320
He knows that the spiders have grown an enormous&nbsp;
amount based on the prints left in the sand.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:50.080
Just then, he confronts a gigantic&nbsp;
spider coming from the nearby mine.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:55.760
He immediately runs away to inform the locals.
On the way, Chris offers Mike a ride. Mike shows&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:00.560
Chris a giant spider leg telling him the mutant&nbsp;
creatures are heading down to the mine shafts.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.600
Chris laughs, thinking that Mike just has a&nbsp;
quirky imagination. He thinks the leg is just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:10.640
a cactus. At home, Mike tries to explain&nbsp;
the transformation of the spiders to Sam,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.240
but she disbelieves him, thinking he&nbsp;
spends too much time watching TV. 
&nbsp;

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.800
Elsewhere in the mine, a man finds that the water&nbsp;
pipes are stuck. He manages to deal with them by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:26.000
blowing into the pipes but surprisingly jumping&nbsp;
spiders emerge from his mouth. A moment later,a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.480
giant leg grabs him, pulls him away and kills him.&nbsp;
Numerous missing pets are then reported in town,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:38.240
this obvious concerns the locals. Pete's cat then&nbsp;
has a fight with one of the spiders in an air vent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:44.800
and is then eaten. Some ostriches on Wade's farm&nbsp;
are then devoured by trapdoor spiders. DJ Harlan,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:50.640
comes up with a theory saying the animals are&nbsp;
abducted by a probe, not by coyotes or wolves.
&nbsp;

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:56.240
At this time, Bret and Ashley fight in the car.&nbsp;
She then kicks him out. Bret is then attacked&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:01.360
by the eight legged monsters. As Bret panics,&nbsp;
he runs to his friends warning them about the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:06.640
spiders. His friends however think it’s simply&nbsp;
a prank. They soon become convinced when one of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:12.160
them is killed by a mutant spider. The group flee&nbsp;
away on their bikes as the monsters pursue them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:17.440
However, the boys’ race is soon brought to a halt&nbsp;
by the jumping spiders. Bret manages to jump over&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:22.560
a highway causing his attackers to explode&nbsp;
in the oil crash. He is the only survivor.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.400
A second later, the spiders show up&nbsp;
again in larger numbers than before.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.320
Bret rides as fast as he can,&nbsp;
hiding himself in a nearby mine. 
&nbsp;

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:35.520
At night in Chris’ aunt’s house, A woman&nbsp;
named Gladys finds that her dog is missing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:39.760
Coming down to the basement, Gladys is&nbsp;
attacked by a few of the oversized spiders.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:44.960
They wrap her in their webbing, creating a cocoon.&nbsp;
Chris then returns home and finds that his aunt is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:50.720
not around, the only thing found is a large insect&nbsp;
leg. He realizes that Mike was telling the truth.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:55.920
It wasn’t just a cactus as he had assumed.
He quickly drives off to see Mike to show him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:01.440
the monstrous leg. Mike now has the chance&nbsp;
to explain everything to Sam and Chris alike.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:06.800
The spiders are growing as big as humans, due to&nbsp;
the released toxins. After looking at the leg,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:12.960
Mike believes auntie Gladys isn’t dead but has&nbsp;
merely been taken away by male orb weavers.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:17.680
They do this to provide for the females. 
Suddenly, the three hear Ashley’s voice shouting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:22.480
aloud. Sam runs to her daughter and sees that&nbsp;
a spider is wrapping her in a cocoon. Chris&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:28.320
manages to fight the monster, buying Sam time to&nbsp;
take a gun. The spider is then shot to death by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:33.840
Sam. As the phone lines are broken Sam uses a&nbsp;
walkie-talkie to call Pete asking him to bring&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:39.600
all of the guns to the police station. Mike says&nbsp;
the spiders are nocturnal hunters, so a broadcast&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:44.240
warning throughout the town is necessary.
In the meantime, spiders show up in various&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:49.040
places and begin attacking people. Pete makes&nbsp;
it in time rescuing Sam’s family before the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:54.160
attackers can enter the house. They rush to&nbsp;
DJ Harlan’s asking to use the station.
&nbsp;

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:58.880
Sam informs the locals telling them that the&nbsp;
town is in a crisis, and is being overrun&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:04.000
by giant spiders. She requires each and&nbsp;
every person to arm themselves. While Mike,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.640
Ashley and Pete wait in the car, a gigantic&nbsp;
tarantula heads towards the station’s van.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:14.000
The boy, who is kind of an expert on spiders,&nbsp;
contacts his mother using the walkie-talkie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.800
telling her not to make any noise. 
Harlan is shocked by the huge animal outside&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:24.640
then accidentally shouts out, which attracts the&nbsp;
giant tarantula. Pete has to open fire, attempting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:31.920
to distract the beast. Luckily, the three escape&nbsp;
and get in the car. The town falls into chaos as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:37.440
the giants begin to invade. They become aggressive&nbsp;
and are starving, and begin hunting humans.
&nbsp;

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:42.800
Sam tells everyone to evacuate the mall, but this&nbsp;
protects them by concrete walls and steel doors.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:46.960
Chris attempts to close the front gate&nbsp;
of the mall prior to the brutal invasion.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:51.840
Sam is last to make it through the gate.
The town people begin to argue about the monsters.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:57.280
Mike tells Sam that she needs to quiet the crowd&nbsp;
for their safety. Just then, Mike becomes an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:03.280
integral part of the crisis. Chris and Harlan take&nbsp;
on a mission to go to the rooftop for cell signal,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:09.120
hoping to contact the army. Those without weapons&nbsp;
have to find anything to fend for themselves. Mike&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:13.520
collects some perfume in the meantime.
Before Chris and Harlan climb to the roof,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:18.080
Mike hands Chris the perfume, saying that&nbsp;
it helps to confuse the spiders. Later,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:23.760
Harlan tries to eliminate the spider, thus buying&nbsp;
Chris time to get a cell signal. Eventually,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:29.200
Chris calls 911. However, the government doesn’t&nbsp;
believe Chris’s story and hangs up on him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:34.640
He becomes extremely angry and disappointed.  
At this time, the tarantula has torn the gate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:39.360
widening the entrance. This sends thousands&nbsp;
of jumping spiders all over the mall.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:43.760
Everyone then retreats to the basement.
Harlan and Chris are facing their opposition&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:50.000
outside. Just then, Harlan, distracts the monsters&nbsp;
to free Chris. Luckily, Harlan lands on a bush,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.240
reuniting with Pete. The two find their&nbsp;
way and get away from the spiders. 
&nbsp;

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:59.360
In the mine shaft, Bret meets up with his father,&nbsp;
mayor Wade. Wade is then abducted by one of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:05.200
spiders, leaving Bret no chance to save him. The&nbsp;
boy rides off again avoiding the invasion.
&nbsp;

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:09.120
While the townspeople are in the basement,&nbsp;
Bret arrives with a forklift blocking the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:13.520
spiders outside. Chris says that they need to&nbsp;
head through the mines, following the cables&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:18.480
before the monsters catch up with them. On&nbsp;
the way, they discover methane-filled tunnels.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:22.400
Chris warns the group that the slightest&nbsp;
spark could blow them all to hell.
&nbsp;

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:27.840
Next, they are stopped by a cocooned figure.&nbsp;
It turns out to be Wade who is still alive.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:32.480
Chris decides to let Sam lead the group out&nbsp;
while he finds his aunt. Before leaving,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:38.160
Chris reveals his feelings to Sam. He tells her&nbsp;
to try and find and operate the generator, located&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:44.720
just outside the mines. He has a plan. Chris then&nbsp;
walks Bret’s bike and heads to find Gladys.
&nbsp;

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:50.240
Eventually, he makes it to see Gladys. Their&nbsp;
moment is interrupted by the giant Consuela.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:54.160
However, Chris couldn’t shoot, due to&nbsp;
the methane gas inside the tunnels.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:59.280
He quickly uses the perfume distracting the beast.&nbsp;
The two get on the bike and escape the spider.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:04.560
On the way out, Chris attaches a set off on&nbsp;
the wire, combining with Sam’s activating the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:10.080
genny outside in order to burn the mines&nbsp;
down. Finally, Sam sparks an explosion,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:15.600
sending all of the spiders to hell. Chris and&nbsp;
Gladys make it out of the mines just in time.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:22.240
At this moment the police and the army arrive.
