Hi, Movie Recaps here.

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.220
Today I will show you a horror film from 2009,
titled Jennifer's Body.

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:08.450
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:10.639
Watch out and take care.

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:15.629
The movie begins inside a prison, where inmate
Anita "Needy" Lesnicki receives tons of letters

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:18.070
and gifts from people concerned about her
sanity.

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.400
Among all this stuff there's a picture of
a boy, Chip Dove, that she keeps near her

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.400
bed.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.300
During lunch, she attacks a doctor that wants
her to improve her diet, so Needy is taken

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.470
to solitary confinement, where she starts
telling us her story through flashbacks.

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.860
It's two months ago.

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:34.989
Needy lives in Devil's Kettle, Minnesota.

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:39.200
The name comes from a local waterfall that
goes into a hole but doesn't come out, researchers

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.640
have thrown many things in there, like balls,
but nothing has ever resurfaced.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.770
The boy from the picture, Chip, is Needy's
boyfriend.

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.750
She's also got a best friend, Jennifer Check,
who is a cheerleader and considered a "babe".

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.000
People can't believe she is friends with a
dork like Needy, but they've known each other

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.399
since childhood.

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.880
Some students even tease Needy, saying she's
gay for Jennifer.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.950
One day, Jennifer asks Needy to come with
her to a bar to attend a concert by indie

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:08.900
rock band Low Shoulder, which she's been following
on MySpace because she likes the singer.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.000
Needy says she already had plans with Chip,
which Jennifer disapproves of, so she pressures

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.080
Needy into changing her mind.

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.680
Needy gives in and agrees to be picked up
later.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.650
In the evening, Needy changes into an outfit
Jennifer would approve of while hanging out

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.550
in her room with Chip, who says it's weird
Needy can tell the moment Jennifer arrives

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.400
without looking outside or even hearing a
doorbell.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:33.220
He also points out Needy is always doing whatever
Jennifer tells her to do, which Needy disagrees

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.530
with: she says they just happen to do the
same activities because they have tons of

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:37.940
things in common.

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.570
Chip thinks it's exactly the opposite, he
claims they have nothing in common.

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.730
They go downstairs and find Jennifer already
waiting inside the house; she calls Chip jealous

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.440
for criticizing the dive bar they'll be going
to.

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.640
When the girls make it to the bar, we see
Chip is right about it not being a club.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.370
There are other students there as well, like
Craig, a football player that tries to hit

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:01.080
on Jennifer and is quickly dismissed; and
Ahmet from India, an exchange student.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.780
When the band arrives at the stage, Jennifer
mentions they're definitely from the city

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.950
and wishes there were more stylish guys like
them in their little town.

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.490
She grabs Needy and drags her with her to
meet the band, and they get to chat with the

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.950
lead singer, Nikolai Wolf.

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.630
Needy asks him why a city band like them is
playing in the middle of nowhere and Nikolai

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.020
says it's because it's important to connect
with fans even in horrible places.

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.300
Needy doesn't like this answer, but Jennifer
doesn't care: she offers to buy him a drink,

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:27.300
which he accepts.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.290
While Jennifer goes to make the order, Needy
entertains herself by playing with the pinball

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.050
machine and ends up overhearing Nikolai talk
to his band members.

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.490
He's telling his bassist that Jennifer is
what they need because she is obviously a

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.970
virgin; Needy interrupts them to defend her
best friend's honor and calls him a creep.

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.590
Then she goes back to Jennifer to tell her
about this conversation, but she only finds

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.070
offense in the fact they thought she was a
virgin, which isn't true.

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.040
The concert starts shortly afterward, during
which Jennifer holds Needy's hand.

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.170
Needy's attention isn't on the music though,
she notices a spontaneous fire starting in

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.640
a corner of the bar and quickly spreading.

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.100
Soon the flames are engulfing the entire place,
and while people run away or die crushed,

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.560
Needy grabs a shocked Jennifer and takes her
to the bathroom, where they escape through

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:09.800
the window.

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.569
Nikolai finds them outside, not looking too
bothered by the tragedy, and he gives Jennifer

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:16.770
his drink before inviting her to join the
band in his van.

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.360
Jennifer accepts despite Needy's protests.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.550
Needy goes back to her house and calls Chip
to tell him what happened while crying in

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:24.270
fear and worry.

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.950
Suddenly someone rings the doorbell, so Needy
asks Chip to stay in the line while she goes

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:29.380
to see who it is.

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.310
It turns out there's nobody at the door, so
Needy hangs up and returns inside, where she

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:34.319
hears some noises.

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:37.959
When she enters the kitchen she's startled
by Jennifer, who is covered in blood and has

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:39.680
a glassy look in her eyes.

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.140
She smiles with her teeth covered in blood
as well before going to the fridge and taking

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.760
a chicken that she starts eating like an animal.

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.430
When Needy tries to stop her, she hollers
at her with a monster-like sound, then she

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.950
vomits a trail of black, spiny fluid.

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.510
Worried, Needy leaves the kitchen to find
her phone and call for help, but Jennifer

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.560
instantly appears in front of her and pushes
her against the wall as she touches her inappropriately.

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.440
Jennifer is about to bite her neck but suddenly
changes her mind, so she pulls away and leaves

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:05.670
the house.

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.110
Needy spends the whole night cleaning the
kitchen floor.

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.520
The next morning, Needy is still in shock
at school while remembering the promise she

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.420
made to Jennifer when they were little kids:
she would never tell on her.

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.100
When Jennifer arrives at class, she acts as
if nothing weird had happened and is very

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:20.910
apathetic about the bar tragedy.

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.760
Their teacher, Mr. Wroblewski, gives a touching
speech about the loss of their classmates,

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:30.590
to which football captain Jonas Kozelle cries
to but Jennifer only keeps callously commenting

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:31.590
on.

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:36.570
After class, everyone in school is grieving,
and all extra activities have been suspended.

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:40.320
Needy tries to tell Chip about Jennifer, but
he thinks it's the grief talking and that

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:41.820
she should see a shrink.

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.720
Their chat is interrupted by Colin Gray, an
emo friend of Needy who tells her he's glad

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.020
to see she came out of the bar ok.

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:52.130
Meanwhile, Jennifer approaches Jonas, who
was best friends with Craig and is deeply

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:53.710
hurt by his death.

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.310
Jennifer tells him she was the last person
to ever talk to Craig and that his last wish

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.670
was for her and Jonas to be a couple.

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:03.230
Jonas accepts to go with her into the woods,
where they start making out, but he keeps

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:07.900
being distracted by the fact Jennifer feels
very warm and a bunch of animals is now surrounding

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:08.900
them.

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.740
Jennifer gets his attention back by touching
him intimately, she also tells him he'll reunite

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:16.780
with Craig soon before opening her mouth in
a demonic shape to eat him.

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:21.020
In the parking lot, Mr. Wroblewski hears Jonas
screaming and thinks he's just crying with

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:24.810
grief, but he soon catches on and enters the
forest to see what's going on.

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:27.710
He finds Jonas' body being eaten by a deer.

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:31.710
The police pick up the body a couple of hours
later, and Jonas' dad promises he'll find

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:33.590
and destroy his son's murderer.

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:37.681
At her house, Needy is cooking while listening
to the news on the radio saying Low Shoulder

00:05:37.681 --> 00:05:39.810
has become heroes after the fire.

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:43.430
Her mother enters the kitchen then and tells
her she dreamed of Needy being nailed to a

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:47.650
tree, expressing worry over one day not being
able to be there for her daughter.

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:52.020
Later on, after bathing in the lake, Jennifer
calls Needy to tell her she's having a great

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:54.980
day, and we see her burn her tongue without
pain.

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:58.860
But Needy hangs up on her after Chip calls
her and asks her to see her at the park.

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:03.229
When they meet, Chip tells her about Jonas'
death, so Needy keeps him company to comfort

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:04.229
him.

00:06:04.229 --> 00:06:07.889
Days continue to pass and the school keeps
on mourning, except for Jennifer, who is as

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:09.290
peppy as always.

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:12.810
Their little town has become famous around
the country, and the press couldn't get enough

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:13.810
of their drama.

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:17.870
The song that Low Shoulder played the night
of the fire becomes a hit nationwide and almost

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:19.310
an anthem in town.

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:23.520
A month after the tragedy, Mr. Wroblewski
tells his class that the band has accepted

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:27.540
to come and play at the school's spring formal
for free, they'll also be donating some of

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:31.340
the profits of their new single to the families
affected by the fire.

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:35.150
Needy thinks they're scummy for using them
as a publicity stunt and reminds everyone

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:38.550
that she was there the night of the fire and
knows the rumor of the band saving anyone

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:43.040
is a lie, which causes her to argue with a
classmate that is a big fan of them.

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:47.020
Class ends before it can escalate, and Needy
leaves with Jennifer, who is looking very

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:48.020
sick.

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:51.510
When Needy comments on it, Jennifer says "it"
is wearing off.

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:55.979
They're suddenly approached by Colin, who
asks Jennifer out, but she turns him down.

00:06:55.979 --> 00:07:00.290
When Needy says she thinks he's cool, however,
Jennifer changes her mind and tells Colin

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:02.050
to come by her place later.

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:05.650
In the evening, Needy goes to Chip's to spend
the night making love.

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:09.680
Meanwhile, Colin is driving to the address
Jennifer texted him, and is rather confused

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:13.509
when he arrives at an abandoned house that
he must enter through a window.

00:07:13.509 --> 00:07:17.240
Following the sound of music playing, he finds
a room filled with burning candles and Jennifer

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:18.800
waiting for him there.

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:23.170
He quickly guesses this is not her actual
house and Jennifer distracts him with kisses,

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:26.100
but when her eyes change colors, he steps
back.

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:29.530
Jennifer grabs him and says she needs him
to be scared, so she breaks his wrists and

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:32.360
throws him on the floor so she can start feeding
on him.

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:36.660
Back to Needy, she starts having hallucinations
while still being intimate with Chip: blood

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:40.430
appears to be leaking from the roof, and a
wounded Jonas and a demonic-looking Jennifer

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:41.919
appear sitting nearby.

00:07:41.919 --> 00:07:46.199
At first, Chip thinks her groans are from
pleasure, but soon he catches on to the fact

00:07:46.199 --> 00:07:49.430
she's truly upset and stops touching her to
comfort her.

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:53.230
Needy is too disturbed to continue, so she
gets dressed and leaves in her car.

00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:56.910
In the middle of the road, she almost crashes
against Jennifer, who is covered in blood

00:07:56.910 --> 00:08:01.220
again and is now jumping on Needy's car window,
but she falls off when Needy drives back at

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:02.600
high speed.

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:06.840
Needy returns to her house and falls asleep
on the couch, crying and dreaming of Jennifer.

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:10.970
She wakes up a few moments later and moves
to her room, and as she gets in the bed, she

00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:14.919
discovers Jennifer is waiting there for her
with no blood in sight and wearing only panties

00:08:14.919 --> 00:08:16.970
and one of Needy's t-shirts.

00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:21.220
Jennifer starts kissing her and after some
initial hesitation, Needy kisses her back,

00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:24.660
only snapping out of it when Jennifer starts
touching her as well.

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:28.220
Needy is freaking out because of what she
saw earlier, so Jennifer finally tells her

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:30.480
the full story of what's going on.

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:34.569
The night of the fire, Low Shoulder took Jennifer
to the waterfall and tie her to the ground

00:08:34.569 --> 00:08:38.260
to sacrifice her to a demon in exchange for
fame and success.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:42.570
The guys stabbed her while singing "Jenny"
to her, then they threw the knife in the waterfall.

00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:47.160
For some reason she didn't die, she just woke
up, not remembering anything, and found her

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:48.399
way to Needy.

00:08:48.399 --> 00:08:52.350
She wasn't able to hurt her because Needy
is her friend, so after leaving her house,

00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:56.990
she took the road and came across Ahmet, who
escaped the fire but nobody knew he was alive.

00:08:56.990 --> 00:08:59.569
So she took him into the woods with her and
fed on him.

00:08:59.569 --> 00:09:03.389
Now Jennifer knows that whenever she's full
she's unkillable, and she demonstrates this

00:09:03.389 --> 00:09:07.290
to Needy by cutting her arm and letting the
wound instantly heal itself.

00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:11.440
Disturbed, Needy asks Jennifer to leave, which
she does by jumping out of the window without

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:12.610
getting hurt.

00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:16.490
Needy assists Colin's funeral a few days later,
where his emo friends and his mother argue

00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:17.769
through their grief.

00:09:17.769 --> 00:09:21.779
Colin gets a memorial at school, and students
are given classes about the buddy system and

00:09:21.779 --> 00:09:26.110
dealing with grief, but nobody seems to care
anymore, they've moved on.

00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:30.269
Needy hasn't, so she starts doing some research
at the paranormal section of the school library

00:09:30.269 --> 00:09:31.980
while avoiding Jennifer.

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:36.480
She discovers her friend is now possessed
by a succubus, a demon that must feed on flesh,

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:40.639
because the ritual had gone wrong thanks to
Jennifer not actually being a virgin.

00:09:40.639 --> 00:09:44.259
The only way to destroy her would be a blade
to the heart while she's weak.

00:09:44.259 --> 00:09:48.449
When Chip comes to her to talk about the incoming
dance, Needy warns him not to go and tries

00:09:48.449 --> 00:09:51.880
to tell him Jennifer is evil now, but he doesn't
believe her.

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:55.019
Needy says she'll go to the dance but not
with him because it's not safe for them to

00:09:55.019 --> 00:09:56.300
be together now.

00:09:56.300 --> 00:10:00.040
When the night of the dance finally comes,
everybody is getting ready for it.

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:03.670
Chip is given a bottle of pepper spray by
his mom, who is worried about his safety after

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:07.970
what happened to Jonas and Colin; and Jennifer
tries to hide how sick she looks with make-up.

00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:12.410
While Needy searches for her friend at the
dance and endures Low Shoulder's performance,

00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:16.480
Jennifer approaches Chip at the park and tells
him Needy has been cheating on him with Colin.

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:20.130
She starts making out with him, and soon he's
asking her to take this somewhere else, so

00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:22.700
Jennifer takes him to an abandoned pool house.

00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:26.279
Chip isn't capable to kiss her anymore because
it's beginning to feel weird, so Jennifer

00:10:26.279 --> 00:10:28.790
throws him in the pool to start shaking him
around.

00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:33.059
Meanwhile, Needy feels something on her lips
and realizes Jennifer's got Chip.

00:10:33.059 --> 00:10:36.160
She goes to his house and his mother tells
her he took the park shortcut to go to the

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:40.559
dance, Needy goes down that way and finds
the corsage he bought her on the ground.

00:10:40.559 --> 00:10:43.920
When Chip cries out for help, Needy follows
the sound of his voice and enters the pool

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:47.360
house, only to find Jennifer has already started
to feed on him.

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:51.220
Needy jumps into the pool, causing Jennifer
to get away from Chip, who gives Needy his

00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:52.220
pepper spray.

00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:55.959
When Jennifer comes closer again, she sprays
her eyes, which makes her throw up on them

00:10:55.959 --> 00:10:58.079
before levitating out of the pool.

00:10:58.079 --> 00:11:01.339
Chip and Needy get out of the pool as well,
and Needy tells Jennifer she's always been

00:11:01.339 --> 00:11:04.320
a bad friend and insults her in various ways.

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:07.880
Jennifer intends to attack her for this, but
as she comes closer, Chip impales her with

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:09.120
a pool skimmer.

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:12.059
It's not enough to kill her though, so she
just leaves through the window while Chip

00:11:12.059 --> 00:11:13.730
dies in Needy's arms.

00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:17.689
A few moments later, Needy is back in her
house, thinking about what happened and deciding

00:11:17.689 --> 00:11:18.879
on a plan.

00:11:18.879 --> 00:11:22.939
After changing into clean, dark clothes, she
goes to see Jennifer, who is at her house

00:11:22.939 --> 00:11:26.739
going through the school yearbook to choose
new victims while looking sick because she

00:11:26.739 --> 00:11:28.110
couldn't feed.

00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:32.170
Needy breaks in by smashing a window and attacks
her with a precision knife, but Jennifer has

00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:35.230
enough strength to fight back and even levitate
a bit.

00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:39.190
She bites Needy on the arm before she cuts
a cross on her stomach, and after some struggling

00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:43.420
in the air, Needy tears off Jennifer's matching
friend necklace, causing her to let go of

00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:45.179
her and fall on the bed.

00:11:45.179 --> 00:11:49.230
Needy lands on top of her and stabs her in
the heart, effectively killing her, but she's

00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:51.269
caught in the act by Jennifer's mother.

00:11:51.269 --> 00:11:55.079
Back in the present, Needy tells us that if
you are bitten by a demon and survive, you

00:11:55.079 --> 00:11:57.070
gain some of its abilities.

00:11:57.070 --> 00:12:01.170
Needy can levitate now, so she uses that power
to escape solitary confinement through the

00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:05.529
window, then uses super strength to simply
walk through the grilles outside.

00:12:05.529 --> 00:12:09.809
She makes her way to a road next to a river,
where she finds Nikolai's knife and the objects

00:12:09.809 --> 00:12:12.249
scientists have thrown into the waterfall.

00:12:12.249 --> 00:12:16.610
As the sun rises, she manages to hitchhike
a ride to Madison, where Low Shoulder is staying

00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:18.060
in a fancy hotel.

00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:22.759
The band is living the best life now with
fans, money, and drugs; that is, until Needy

00:12:22.759 --> 00:12:25.549
finds them and murders them all.

00:12:25.549 --> 00:12:30.709
