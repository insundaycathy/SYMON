00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.560
Hello everyone, this is Mr. Brain Junkie here!
and today we'll be talking about a fantasy

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.050
action film called Along with the Gods, be
ready for some spoilers ahead!

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.389
Somewhere in the population center of Korea,
a large building is burning in flames while

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:19.289
a firefighter named Hong jumps out from the
building, trying to save a civilian's life.

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.749
His rope is burned by the raging heat, causing
him to fall quickly onto the ground, without

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:25.579
landing on the saftey cushion.

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:30.569
His entire life flashes before his eyes, but
surprisingly, the man is able to wake up after

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:32.700
saving the little girl from being killed.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.250
He gets up and rushes towards the girl's family,
trying to see if the victim is hurt, but no

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.710
matter how hard he talks, no one seems to
be responding.

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.620
Suddenly he hears a voice calling his name
from afar, and sees two people in suits smiling

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.670
towards him amidst the chaos.

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.030
Hong tries telling them to step away from
the falling debris, but soon notices the firefighters

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.829
trying to save a man who looks exactly like
the main character himself.

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.941
The woman named Choon tells Hong that he's
paragon before he died, and they are here

00:00:59.941 --> 00:01:02.850
to assist him through the 7 trials of judgements.

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.659
The other guardian called Mak tells him that
their leader is waiting for them before the

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.200
gates towards the trials, and they have to
go there right now.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.380
Hong has trouble taking all this information
in, and slowly walks away while looking at

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.920
his comrades mourning over his dead body.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.880
He screams that he can't die right now as
he wants to see his mother, but the man's

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.159
body begins levitating in the air towards
the giant portal.

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:27.950
Hong continues shouting about seeing his mother,
while the guardians are touched that he's

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.929
so caring towards his parent even after death.

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:35.280
They arrive in different dimension where thousands
of people are heading towards the gates of

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.280
judgement,

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.509
and Hong meets the guardian leader called
Rim, who's helped 47 souls to reincarnate

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:41.859
in the the past century.

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:46.540
When the leader congratulates Hong for being
a paragon, the man looks away and declines,

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.649
stating that he's not a good person at all.

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:52.590
They enter through the gates of judgement,
but are teleported to a nightmarish place

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.189
full of lava called the mountain of murder.

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:59.709
Mak is shocked to see their location and immediately
questions Hong if he's killed someone in his

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:03.659
life, but the man denies having ever done
something so terrible.

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.770
Rim explains that causing someone's death
indirectly through inaction is also judged

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.060
by the trials, which may be the reason that
they're here.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.240
Hong arrives on a stadium where large doors
on the ground opens up, revealing a giant

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.770
pit filled with lava.

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.080
The people who are punished try desperately
to climb out, but they continuously burn inside

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.470
the sea of flames.

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.880
The prosecutors begin the trial by accusing
Hong of not saving one of his colleagues when

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.350
he had the chance to do so, which eventually
led to the man's death.

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:35.300
They demand that Hong suffers inside the lava
pit for 5 years, in order to atone the sin

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.080
of not saving his friend.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.080
Rim defends the man by requesting to closer
examine on what really happened at the incident.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.170
Apparently, Hong did try to desperately save
his friend at the scene, but they couldn't

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.990
move the stone that the fire fighter was trapped
under.

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:53.270
After realizing the hopeless situation, His
colleague told him to leave and save the other

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.050
civilians instead.

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.990
Because of Hong's decision, He was able to
save eight people that night.

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:03.350
Rim argues that the man's heroism should be
taken into consideration when judging his

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.400
decision to leave his friend behind.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.860
Seeing the man's bravery at helping others,
the judge decides to exonerate him from the

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.220
charges and allow him to pass on to the next
trials.

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.620
Although Hong has won the first hearing, he's
greatly affected by the reminder of his colleague's

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:18.620
death.

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.500
He demands to know why the guardians are helping
him, as he doesn't believe himself to be a

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:23.510
Paragon.

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.150
It turns out that the guardians have their
own agendas, as they made a deal with the

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.090
king of hell who's called Yeomra.

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.430
If the three are able to help 49 dead souls
to go through the trials and reincarnate within

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.390
the century, they can also become humans as
well.

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:41.380
They eventually arrive at the trial of Indolence,
where Choon explains all the labors that Hong

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:42.470
has completed.

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:46.790
The man has never been lazy through out his
life, and always helped others no matter where

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:47.790
he went.

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.500
this even means knocking over a beehives and
subjecting his whole team to terrible stings,

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.750
or rescuing some grumpy cat on the edge of
a building and breaking the owner's Lamborghini

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:57.830
with his head.

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:02.740
The judge was so moved by Hong's contributions
that she orders the prosecutors to immediately

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:05.200
build a statue in honor of the paragon.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:10.670
However, when she inquires about why the man
wanted to live his life so fully, Hong replied

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:12.840
that the reason was simply for money.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.380
Upon hearing the man's answer, the judge quickly
changes her verdict and tells the prosecutors

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.489
to send Hong into the punishment,

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:23.620
where a giant machines chases after all the
people guilty of indolence, crushing their

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.770
bones and feeding them to the fishes.

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.900
The guardians try their best to help their
defendant, and begs the goddess to look closer

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.180
at the man's life.

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.110
The reason Hong worked so hard to make money
was because he wanted to support his mother

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.530
who was sick and his brother who wanted to
go to law school.

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:43.030
Hong worked so much that he often disregarded
his own health, and his desire for money is

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.340
therefore not due to selfishness.

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:49.750
After realizing the man's true motivations,
the goddess finds that Hong is not guilty

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:52.070
as he only wanted to help his family.

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:55.860
The group quickly boards the boat that will
take them to the next location, but before

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.970
they can celebrate, they notice that they
are being pursued by numerous monsters.

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:04.010
The team unleashes their weapons and tries
their best to defend against the creatures.

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:08.100
They're able to defeat many of the enemies
by cutting them into pieces, but the captain

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:11.450
eventually gets knocked over the ship and
barely hangs on.

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:16.190
Mak is forced to defend the ship all by himself
while giving his leader the chance to recover.

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:20.910
In the finally moment, Mak strikes a large
stone pillar that causes the rocks to fall,

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:23.090
finally saving them from the monster's pursuit.

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:27.370
The man explains that this can only happen
because a family of Hong has died and became

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:28.680
a vengeful spirit.

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:33.320
In order to stop other monsters from pursuing
them in the future, Rim decides to visit Hong's

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:36.430
family in order to find out the truth about
what happened.

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:40.600
He goes to Hong's resident and notices that
the mother is clearly alive, this can only

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:44.830
mean that it was the brother Soo who died
and turned into a vengeful spirit.

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:48.890
The evil aura tries to run away while the
guardian chases closely behind.

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:53.040
Rim tries to stop the spirit by catching it
using his weapon, but the ghost manages to

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.010
avoid the attacks from behind.

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:59.860
The two eventually clashes together and knocks
the guardian away, allowing the spirt to disappear

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:02.250
as Rim looks desperately for his prey.

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:06.260
The guardian follows the trail to a military
base, where he noticed the soldier talking

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.190
about Soo and referring to him as a deserter.

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:12.940
What's even more curious is that the captain
and one of his fellow soldiers is clearly

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:14.210
hiding something.

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:19.090
Rim disguises as a colonel of the army and
proceeds to question the captain about Soo,

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:20.990
accusing him of killing the man.

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:25.510
Surprisingly, the captain begins blackmailing
the guardian out of fear, which further confirms

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:27.960
that he's responsible for the brother's death.

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:32.270
On the other side, Hong is being questioned
by the goddess of deceit, and accused of writing

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:36.990
numerous false wills and testaments for his
colleague, which he failed to save earlier.

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:41.110
He gave these writings to the man's daughter,
lying to her by pretending to be the girl's

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:42.110
father.

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:45.949
The goddess immediately orders the man to
be tied up and prepares to punish him by cutting

00:06:45.949 --> 00:06:47.120
off his tongue.

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:52.360
Luckily, Rim is able to connect to his team
through telepathy and argues for Hong's actions.

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:57.139
It turns out that he also wrote false letters
to his mother, lying about how great his life

00:06:57.139 --> 00:06:58.870
is and how wealthy he became.

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:02.720
Rim argues that these are all attempts to
comfort the people that he cares about, by

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:06.930
providing them hope that reality can't offer,
and allowing them to live on.

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:11.630
Upon realizing that Hong did all this in order
to provide others a reason to live on, the

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:15.920
deity forgives the man's crimes as the intentions
were never to harm.

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:20.161
After the trial, Rim lies to Hong and tells
him that his families are doing fine, but

00:07:20.161 --> 00:07:23.560
quickly informs the team about the truth regarding
Hong' brother.

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:27.960
Rim goes back in time to see what really happened
on the of night Soo's death, and realizes

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:32.090
that his comrade Dong shot the man by accident
after switching off the safety.

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:36.440
Dong called their captain right away, and
instead of trying to save the dying man, the

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:40.020
soldier decides to burry Soo and hide the
evidence so that his promotion would not be

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:41.020
soiled.

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:45.660
Rim looks at the body of Soo and realizes
in shock that the man was actually not dead,

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:49.680
forcing him to remember the memories from
his past where his father was also buried

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:50.680
alive.

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:55.040
At the same time, Hong has arrived in the
hell of injustice, where the people are frozen

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:58.630
for years in order to pay for their crime
of not helping others.

00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:03.440
Thankfully, Hong's profession as a firefighter
means that he'll not be judged here, but instead

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:05.600
be allowed to move on to the next location.

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:09.630
During the ride inside the cable car, it's
revealed that the guardians all have their

00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:12.419
memories erased except for their leader Rim.

00:08:12.419 --> 00:08:17.070
Mak tries to stop his teammate from revealing
anymore about their limitations, but accidentally

00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:20.690
informs Hong that his brother is in fact the
vengeful spirit.

00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:25.040
Upon realizing the truth, the man's unstable
psyche shakes the entire realm and breaks

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:27.890
the cable car, nearly dropping his guardians
below,

00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:32.580
But Hong is able to pull himself together
in the last moment, and offers to help his

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:33.580
teammates.

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:37.330
The three eventually arrives in the hell of
betrayal, where a beautiful goddess judges

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:41.300
the people who betrayed their loved ones by
trapping them in a mirror and shattering the

00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:42.300
victims.

00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:46.940
Luckily, Hong was a paragon in his lifetime
and did not betray anyone, allowing him to

00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:49.760
move on safely from this location as well.

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:53.710
At the same time, Rim is able to find the
vengeful spirit in a night club where he's

00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:56.770
trying to kill one of soldiers who buried
him alive.

00:08:56.770 --> 00:09:01.000
The guardian chases after Soo right away,
and they fight continuously in the air while

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.460
flying through the city.

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:06.750
Rim is able to capture the spirit by setting
a trap and tying him onto the building using

00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:08.020
a magical rope.

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:12.370
The guardian tells the spirit that he needs
to forgive his killers in order to be reborn,

00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:14.390
or else he'll be destroyed forever,

00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:18.620
but this only served to remind Soo about how
he was buried alive and betrayed by his best

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:23.410
friends, causing him to scream in rage and
break free by creating a massive shockwave.

00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:27.920
On the other side, after drinking numerous
amounts of alcohol, Dong has decided to give

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:32.630
the location of the body to Soo's mother,
unable to bear with the guilt any longer.

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:37.110
The woman open the map and finally sees the
location of his youngest son, while Soo watches

00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:39.100
everything from behind his mother.

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:43.270
The vengeful spirit goes to Rim and tells
the guardian that he has decided to forgive

00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:47.650
Dong, after seeing the soldier's guilt and
how the location of the body was given to

00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:48.650
the mother.

00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:53.020
Soo begs the guardian to act like a medium
so that he may talk to Dong for the last time,

00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:55.520
promising that he'll go through the trials
afterwards.

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:59.320
The spirit talks through the man and tells
the soldier that he forgives him, and to not

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:02.120
waste anymore new tears on something from
the past.

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:07.020
Meanwhile, Hong has reached the hell of violence
and sees a giant hole in which they must jump

00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:08.870
into in order to reach the trials.

00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:13.370
The man falls into the massive opening and
crashes into a giant rock, but Mak is able

00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:16.080
to catch his teammate and land beside Hong.

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:20.700
However, Hong slides towards the two and knocks
them over by accident, causing them to free

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:23.450
fall once again towards the bottom of the
pit.

00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:27.510
Mak rushes towards the two while Hong is able
to grab the girl and tries to save her from

00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:29.750
the crash just like before he died.

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:34.200
Surprisingly, their fall is quickly stopped
at the last moment after reaching the bottom.

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:38.890
The trial of violence begins and the prosecutors
accuse Hong of beating up his brother in high

00:10:38.890 --> 00:10:39.890
school.

00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:44.080
This action was especially unforgivable as
the young boy was suffering from malnutrition

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:46.570
due to how poor the family was at the time.

00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:50.890
In fact, Hong never sought out forgiveness
after the fight, as he ran off away from his

00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:54.420
family the very next day, and never went home
ever since.

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:58.640
The judge decides quickly that the man is
guilty of violence towards his own family,

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:03.800
and plans to sent him into a pit where people
are constantly hit by rocks as punishment.

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:07.530
Seeing that Hong is about to be sentenced,
Choon quickly demands the judge to hold off

00:11:07.530 --> 00:11:11.440
the conviction, and look at the final trial
together with the current one, as they are

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:12.890
closely related.

00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:17.830
This play is very risky as it requires the
guardians to forfeit their powers in the afterlife

00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:20.950
if Hong was found to be guilty on the next
trial.

00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:24.660
Unfortunately, the guardians quickly learn
the truth about what happened on that night

00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:25.660
of the fight.

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:29.980
Soo woke up after seeing his brother kneeling
before their mom, and demands to know what

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:34.130
Hong was doing, but soon finds out that the
boy was trying to kill his own mother using

00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:35.170
a pillow.

00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:39.459
Soo tried to stop his brother immediately,
which caused Hong to eventually drop the pillow

00:11:39.459 --> 00:11:42.690
and begin punching the young boy continuously
with anger.

00:11:42.690 --> 00:11:46.860
It turns out that Hong felt very hopeless
at that time of his life as their family was

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:49.440
so poor and his mother was gravely ill.

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:53.830
The only way he believed that can end their
suffering was through death and nothing else.

00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:58.660
This is also why he felt extremely guilty
afterwards and ran away from home, never returning

00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:00.680
to his family ever again.

00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:04.839
After hearing this, the guardians become hopeless
as they realize that there is no way they

00:12:04.839 --> 00:12:09.500
can win the trials now, especially in the
final hell of filial impiety.

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:13.990
At the same time, Rim is trying to bring Soo
towards his body so that the spirit can finally

00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:16.990
begin the journey towards reincarnation as
well.

00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:21.670
When they arrive at the military camp, Soo
is surprised to see that his mother is here,

00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:24.279
begging the soldiers to bring her to her son's
body.

00:12:24.279 --> 00:12:28.500
The captain of the army sees this and rushes
towards the woman, ripping her signs into

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:32.950
pieces and pushing her onto the ground, causing
her to faint in the exertion.

00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:37.529
Soo sees that his mother is being attacked
by his killer and becomes engulfed in rage,

00:12:37.529 --> 00:12:40.560
quickly turning into the vengeful spirit that
he was before.

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:44.970
He breaks free from the restraints and grabs
onto the guardian, throwing the man away using

00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:46.190
tremendous force.

00:12:46.190 --> 00:12:51.279
Soo's fury becomes so intense that he turns
into a giant tornado, engulfing all the soldiers

00:12:51.279 --> 00:12:54.930
in the area and opening a gateway towards
the afterlife itself.

00:12:54.930 --> 00:12:59.240
The vengeful spirit tosses everything around
and creating massive chaos, while Rim tries

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:02.040
desperately to save all the people from being
killed.

00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:06.920
Luckily, Mak is able to charge into the living
world through the portal and launches at Soo,

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:09.790
breaking away the giant statue and stunning
the enemy.

00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:14.550
Rim takes the chance and charges in as well,
capturing Soo using a magical rope and finally

00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:16.620
putting a stop to the rampage.

00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:20.910
Meanwhile, the trial of Hong begins at the
other end as king Yeomra himself decides to

00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:22.460
be the judge for the case.

00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:26.760
The deity charges the man with attempting
to murder his own mother and beating his brother

00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:28.290
in such a desperate time.

00:13:28.290 --> 00:13:33.010
The king also reveals that Hong's mother actually
knew about her son's attempt kill her,

00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:37.279
but remained silent and kept all this tragedy
inside her heart, which makes the man's crime

00:13:37.279 --> 00:13:38.350
even worse.

00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:42.610
The deity concludes that Hong will be punished
forever in this hell, as he tried to commit

00:13:42.610 --> 00:13:46.100
the worst thing possible of killing the one
who gave him life.

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:50.720
Suddenly, the entire realm begins shaking
as a voice begins speaking to Hong's mother.

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:54.701
It turns out that Rim has used his power to
allow Soo to speak to his mother in a dream,

00:13:54.701 --> 00:13:57.480
and the son apologizes for his brother.

00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:02.370
Soo tell the woman that Hong has worked non-stop
for 15 years in order to support them ever

00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:05.660
since that night, after feeling guilty for
what he did.

00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:10.240
Surprisingly, the mother reveals that she
has forgiven her son a long time ago, and

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:14.120
apologizes herself for not being able to provide
for her children.

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:18.310
Hong hears this and falls into tears, while
the king himself has been moved by their display

00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:19.360
of family.

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:24.089
The deity decides that he can no longer charge
Hong for his crimes, as the victim has forgave

00:14:24.089 --> 00:14:27.769
him a long time ago, thus allowing the man
to be reincarnated.

00:14:27.769 --> 00:14:31.870
Hong hears this and bows towards Choon, thanking
the guardians for helping him through the

00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:34.960
journey, before disappearing into the bright
lights.

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:40.050
Back in the mortal realm, Rim has decided
to bring Soo as their 49th reincarnation,

00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:43.860
planning to achieve their deal for the king
so that they can be reborn as well.

00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:48.350
The group arrives inside the hell of filial
impiety in front of numerous demons, and charges

00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:53.140
towards the enemies in order to open a way
to the king of hell himself.

00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:55.010
