Hi guys, Korean Movie Recapped here.

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:12.150
Before we start, WARNING!

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.190
Spoilers Ahead!

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:19.449
Today, I’m going to recap a 2021 Korean
Romance Comedy movie, called Sweet &amp; Sour.

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:23.890
This movie tells the story of a couple who
faces the hurdles of maintaining a long distance

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.960
relationship amidst their packed working hours.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.241
Even though one of them apologizes, their
relationship still doesn’t work out.

00:00:30.241 --> 00:00:35.820
A new third wheel comes into their relationship
and changes the supposed result in an unexpected

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:36.820
way.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.030
So, what are the hurdles that they face?

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.739
How does the third wheel manage to influence
their relationship ? Let’s find it out.

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.649
The movie starts with Hyuk who is hospitalized
due to his hepatitis.

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:51.819
Due to the illness which is believed to be
contagious, he is teased by his parents and

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:53.059
the other patients often.

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:58.280
Da-eun as a nurse usually takes care of his
needs and will defend him from the bullies.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.280
As they spend their time together, Hyuk develops
a feeling towards her.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.799
At one time, he meets her and asks her about
her ring.

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:10.530
She says that it’s only a graduation ring
and that she is not married or engaged.

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.770
After that, she utilizes his feelings towards
her and visits him to eat his food and sleep

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:16.189
in his chamber.

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:20.530
Seeing her condition, Hyuk gladly takes care
of her by sparing his food and watches over

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.219
her as she sleeps during the work hours.

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:27.170
During lunch, he says something rude to her
and she becomes mad at him.

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.710
Before Hyuk is able to apologize, his conditions
become better and he is discharged.

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.499
Hyuk visits the hospital once more to look
for her, but she is on leave.

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:40.700
Fortunately, he manages to get her phone number
instead and decides to call her.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.350
Hyuk was hesitant at first but is able to
confess his feelings to Da-eun.

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.299
That night, Da-eun invites him to her house.

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.009
Without further thought, he rushes there with
his father’s car and they end up spending

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:53.530
the night together.

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.220
In the morning, Hyuk wakes up early and cooks
some breakfast.

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.460
He also changes Da-eun’s broken light bulb
which makes her cry gratefully.

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.749
She kisses him to say thank you but he misunderstands
it.

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:09.170
Unfortunately, she is not in the mood of nurturing
a relationship at the moment.

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.350
After that event, they become closer and Hyuk
regularly visits her in the hospital and her

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:14.950
house to take care of her.

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.459
Hyuk also picks her up from the hospital with
his dad’s car to keep her away from a doctor

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:21.110
who flirts with her.

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.390
When they are having dinner, Hyuk realizes
that she is not wearing her graduation ring

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.409
anymore and she admits that she has lost it.

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:32.530
During one of his visits, Da-eun invites Hyuk
to go to Jeju saying that someone gives her

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.360
a vacation package.

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.580
As they depart for their trip, she gives him
running sneakers as a present.

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.790
Feeling thankful for the present, Hyuk promises
to lose some weight and go to Jeju again next

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.690
year with a leaner body.

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.209
He tries to run with the new sneakers and
has achieved a leaner body after some time.

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:53.360
Then, he moves into Da-eun’s house and continues
to take care of her.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.160
Hyuk, who is working as a construction engineer
gets promoted.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.700
However, he must transfer to Seoul and work
as a contract employee first before being

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.680
assigned as a full timer.

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.730
He is happy to hear it and decides to persuade
Da-eun to let him achieve his career since

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.640
Seoul is quite far from their house in Incheon.

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.670
Seeing that Da-eun is hesitant in letting
him go, he buys a new car and says that he

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.069
will commute from the house to his new workplace
every day.

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:22.410
He also gives her an engagement ring because
she hasn’t had one since she lost her graduation

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:23.410
ring.

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.750
Finally, Da-eun agrees to his transfer and
Hyuk starts to commute every day.

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.290
In his new workplace, Hyuk meets Bo-yeong
who is also a transfer.

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:37.079
She is very competitive since they are both
contract employees fighting for the same spot.

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:41.150
Her competitiveness makes her a toxic colleague
for Hyuk and he complains a lot about her

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:42.709
every day to Da-eun.

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:47.420
Hyuk becomes obsessed to get his revenge on
Bo-yeong and ignores Da-eun who reminds him

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.580
of their next trip to Jeju.

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.709
During one of the meetings, Hyuk points out
a grave mistake in Bo-yeong’s bridge design

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:56.540
which makes him succeed in getting his revenge.

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.500
The higher-ups decide that Hyuk and Bo-yeong
should work together in finishing the project.

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.950
Hyuk who is still annoyed with her toxicity
doesn’t help her and teases her design,

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:07.319
over and over.

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:11.209
That night, Bo-yeong works overnight and Hyuk
leaves her to come home.

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:15.079
Hyuk is trapped in the traffic and ends up
sleeping right away without spending his time

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:16.510
with Da-eun.

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.620
Seeing his sacrifice, Da-eun lets him stay
in Seoul for the weekdays and meet her on

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:21.950
the weekends.

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:26.230
In the morning, He finds Bo-yeong who didn’t
have any sleep due to the target.

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:29.980
She decides to spend another night in the
office and Hyuk pities her.

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.670
He starts to help her in her designs that
night.

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:36.700
In the meeting, the higher-ups commend them
for the progress and show that they are promising

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.090
candidates for a full timer.

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.930
Having fulfilled his project, Hyuk comes home
to meet Da-eun but her schedule just got shuffled

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:46.010
and she needs to work that night.

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:50.200
She apologizes and asks him to change a broken
light bulb in the house.

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:54.300
In the office, Bo-yeong starts to flirt with
Hyuk since they need to work together for

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:55.730
the upcoming projects.

00:04:55.730 --> 00:05:00.670
So, they start to spend their night together
in the office to catch up with the deadline.

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:05.010
Hyuk also starts to take care of her sloppiness
to preserve her public image.

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:09.530
Da-eun starts to realize that Hyuk spends
more time with Bo-yeong instead of her, and

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:11.360
is afraid of losing him.

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.540
She needs to tell him something important
but Hyuk is pulling an all-nighter with Bo-yeong,

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:17.920
so they reschedule their meeting for the next
day.

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:22.580
However, Hyuk grabs a drink with Bo-yeong
instead, under the pretense of celebrating

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:24.000
their success.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.720
He lied to Da-eun saying that he cannot make
it again tonight because he is hanging out

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:28.900
with his new boss.

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:32.340
Da-eun is disappointed and chooses to keep
it silent.

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:37.490
To add to her dilemma, Da-eun sees that Hyuk
hasn’t changed the broken light bulb too.

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:41.720
Once again, Bo-yeong tries to flirt with Hyuk
but he reluctantly leaves instead to meet

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:42.900
Da-eun.

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:46.840
Hyuk is trapped in the traffic again and is
annoyed since he has to do house chores as

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:48.590
soon as he gets home.

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:52.520
Both Da-eun and Hyuk are tired due to overwork
and they get into a fight.

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:56.990
Da-eun complains that he also hasn’t changed
the light bulb unlike what he promised.

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:00.850
She adds that he only comes home to sleep
and not to spend time with her.

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:04.180
Hyuk replies with profanity and it saddens
Da-eun.

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:06.920
She reveals that she is pregnant with their
child.

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:10.520
The news is not welcomed by Hyuk and they
decide to abort the baby.

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:14.070
Hyuk takes a leave and accompanies Da-eun
to the clinic.

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:18.470
Seeing that Hyuk is not enjoying his time,
Da-eun lets him wait in the car.

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:22.870
Due to the abortion, Da-eun feels so down
and Hyuk tries to comfort her.

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:27.750
However, his phone keeps on ringing due to
the unfinished project and Da-eun sacrifices

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:30.990
herself once more and lets Hyuk go to work
instead.

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:35.620
Deep inside, Da-eun is sad since his boyfriend
is not the same as he used to be.

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:40.740
Hyuk cannot focus on his work and his relationship
due to the unending work and commute.

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:45.370
When they hang out, Da-eun realizes that Hyuk
is reluctant to spend his time with her.

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:49.370
She questions his love towards her and Hyuk
disappoints her when he calls her Pretty Bo-yeong

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:51.060
instead of her name.

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:55.360
She asks him about Bo-yeong and Hyuk insists
that she is just a co-worker.

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:57.890
As a result, they break up that night.

00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:02.270
In the office, Hyuk receives a package from
Da-eun, containing the engagement ring that

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:03.270
he gave her.

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:08.070
Hyuk doesn’t care about it and continues
to nurture his relationship with Bo-yeong.

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:11.060
They even kiss and spend the night together
that day.

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:15.330
Convinced in their separation, Hyuk messages
Da-eun saying that he won’t be going and

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:18.180
that she can take whoever she wants to Jeju.

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:22.270
Hyuk is confused to see that her social media
status is still the same as it used to be

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:24.220
when they are together.

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:28.110
Afterwards, Hyuk is continuously reminded
of their trip to Jeju.

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:32.270
Despite Hyuk’s and Bo-yeong’s effort in
completing the project, the higher-ups decide

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:35.250
that none of them will be promoted to be a
full timer.

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:39.500
They spend their last celebration night with
the firm before going back to their own previous

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:40.590
workplace.

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:45.120
Upon scrolling through his phone, Hyuk is
reminded by his promise with Da-eun to spend

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:46.530
their Christmas in Jeju.

00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:49.430
Hyuk rushes to the airport that night to meet
Da-eun.

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:53.509
Suddenly, he bumps into another person and
falls.

00:07:53.509 --> 00:07:57.490
Turns out, that person is actually the fat
Hyuk who we saw running in the airport at

00:07:57.490 --> 00:07:58.580
the earlier scenes.

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:03.500
Da-eun met lean Hyuk 1 year and 7 months ago
and fell in love with him.

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:06.750
She flirted with him and bought him the same
matching sneakers.

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:11.790
She also spent Christmas in Jeju with lean
Hyuk and decided to go there every Christmas.

00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:15.700
After their trip, lean Hyuk started to work
in Seoul and had an affair with Bo-yeong.

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:19.400
Meanwhile, Da-eun met fat Hyuk 3 months ago.

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:23.470
The ring that fat Hyuk asked about is actually
the engagement ring that lean Hyuk gave to

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:24.670
Da-eun.

00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:29.130
When their relationship was breaking down,
fat Hyuk was always there to comfort her.

00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:33.550
Due to her pregnancy, Da-eun needed to eat
and sleep a lot, which is why she sneaked

00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:36.190
into fat Hyuk’s chamber to eat and sleep.

00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:40.099
She was mad at fat Hyuk when he said something
rude because lean Hyuk had been treating her

00:08:40.099 --> 00:08:41.370
that way.

00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:46.000
When she was feeling down after the abortion,
fat Hyuk called her and confessed his love,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.959
so she invited him to come.

00:08:47.959 --> 00:08:52.649
His action of changing the broken bulb really
replaced lean Hyuk’s place in her heart.

00:08:52.649 --> 00:08:56.270
When lean Hyuk couldn’t come due to his
work, fat Hyuk was there to spend his time

00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:58.009
wholeheartedly with her.

00:08:58.009 --> 00:09:02.399
She told fat Hyuk that she lost her graduation
ring, but the reason is that she has broken

00:09:02.399 --> 00:09:05.449
up with lean Hyuk and sent the ring back to
him.

00:09:05.449 --> 00:09:10.520
Lean Hyuk gave up on their trip to Jeju, so
Da-eun invited fat Hyuk to go instead.

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:14.570
She also bought the same matching sneakers
for fat Hyuk to motivate him.

00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:19.430
After all that, Da-eun decides to forget lean
Hyuk, and pretends to not recognize him and

00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:21.180
continues their trip to Jeju.

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:25.589
Lean Hyuk is mad at Da-eun for dumping him
and comes back to Bo-yeong.

00:09:25.589 --> 00:09:29.149
He even tries to propose to Bo-yeong but she
rejects him.

00:09:29.149 --> 00:09:33.840
He rethinks his past to find a person he can
blame, and concludes that it is his old boss’

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:37.579
fault who transferred him to Seoul and made
him break up with Da-eun.

00:09:37.579 --> 00:09:42.220
In the end, he laments his misfortune for
not getting both his love and dream job.
