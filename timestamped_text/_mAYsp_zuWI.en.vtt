00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.080
Story Recapped here. Today,&nbsp;
I’m going to explain a drama,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.920
romance, and sci-fi film called, “The Giver.”&nbsp;
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.040
After a calamity called The Ruin, society&nbsp;
reorganized into literal black and white&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.360
communities. The communities are ruled&nbsp;
over by elders, including the Chief Elder.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.800
In order to maintain peace and harmony,&nbsp;
anything that threatens unity was removed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:31.200
This means that in this world, there is no such&nbsp;
thing as skin color, race, or religion. Everyone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:37.680
is one and the same. Conflict, pain, and suffering&nbsp;
were removed, but so were emotions, freedom,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.760
individuality, and joy. For the betterment of&nbsp;
society, humans are forbidden to lie. Sexual&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.800
desire and reproduction were prohibited and all&nbsp;
humans were now being genetically engineered.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.800
Once a person comes into age, he or she will&nbsp;
take their assigned place in the community.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.840
One day before the Graduation ceremony,&nbsp;
18-year-old Jonas rides his bike with his two best&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:06.960
friends, Fiona and Asher, on their way to their&nbsp;
last day volunteering at the Nurturing Center.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.080
Unlike his friends, Jonas feels scared and unsure&nbsp;
of the path that he’s going to be assigned to.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.640
He feels different from his friends and sometimes,&nbsp;
he sees things like a color that only he can see.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.640
They arrive at the Nurturing Center&nbsp;
where Jonas’s assigned Father&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.800
also works. His father is currently&nbsp;
caring for an Uncertain newborn,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:30.080
a baby who hasn't been assigned to their family&nbsp;
unit yet. The Uncertain newborn, named Gabriel,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.800
cries out but Fiona quickly soothes him as Jonas’s&nbsp;
Father coos his name. Jonas is concerned since&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.960
knowing a newborn’s name is against the rules but&nbsp;
his Father reassures him that the sound of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:46.560
name calms the baby. As his Father explains, Jonas&nbsp;
looks over at Fiona and sees a tinge of red in her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.240
hair. He dismisses it and they continue with their&nbsp;
work. At the end of the day, the trio walks to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.720
fountain and does their little ritual of jumping&nbsp;
through the mini waterfall. They talk about their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.040
impending Graduation and promise that no matter&nbsp;
what roles are assigned to them, they will remain&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:06.480
friends. Later that night, Jonas expresses his&nbsp;
anxiety during Feelings time at dinner, a time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:14.160
when his Father, Mother, and little sister, Lily,&nbsp;
talk about their day. His Mother reassures him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.080
that the elders are never wrong and that they’ve&nbsp;
been watching him since Jonas was a Newchild so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.840
they will pick the perfect role for him. This does&nbsp;
nothing to help Jonas’s anxiety. The next morning,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.640
the day to finally graduate arrives. The Chief&nbsp;
Elder appears as a hologram and hosts the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.520
Graduation ceremony. The ceremony starts with the&nbsp;
presentation of the Elders who have now retired&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.400
and will be released to Elsewhere, a retirement&nbsp;
home for members of the community. After that,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.400
newborns are assigned to their birth mothers,&nbsp;
children at the age of nine are given a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.360
symbol of their developing independence and&nbsp;
responsibility. Soon enough, Jonas and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.440
other graduates join the stage where the elders&nbsp;
will now assign them their roles in the community.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.560
Fiona is assigned as a Nurturer as&nbsp;
predicted while Asher becomes a Drone Pilot.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.520
The elders, however, skip Jonas’s number,&nbsp;
until all the graduates have left the stage.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.880
The elders reassure the audience that this is not&nbsp;
a mistake. They chose carefully this time because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:12.320
they couldn’t afford another failure. Because&nbsp;
of Jonas’s intelligence, integrity, courage,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:18.000
and capacity to see beyond, he has chosen to be&nbsp;
the next Receiver of Memory. After the ceremony,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.480
Jonas asks his Father what the Chief Elder meant&nbsp;
by “can’t afford another failure,” but his Mother&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.760
shuts down the conversation. In his bedroom, Jonas&nbsp;
activates the chip to learn about his new role.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:33.840
As the next Receiver of Memory, it’s his duty to&nbsp;
report directly to the current Receiver of Memory.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.160
After his training, he is to return to&nbsp;
his dwelling immediately. As of now,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.840
he is also exempt from rules governing&nbsp;
rudeness and he can ask any question.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.800
Aside from his daily injection, he will not&nbsp;
take any medication, especially ones that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:51.360
prohibit pain. He may not discuss his training&nbsp;
with anyone and he will be permitted to lie.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:57.040
On his first day of training, Jonas wears his&nbsp;
uniform, making him stick out from the rest,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.280
and rides his bike all the way to the Edge where&nbsp;
a house stood. He enters the house and since&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:06.320
he’s the new Receiver of Memory, it makes the&nbsp;
current one, the Giver. The Giver sits on his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:11.040
chair and makes Jonas sit across from him. All the&nbsp;
humans in their communities have no memories of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:16.400
the ancient past except for one, the Receiver of&nbsp;
Memory. When the elders need guidance on matters&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:21.360
beyond their experience, they go to the Receiver&nbsp;
of Memory who gives them wisdom. Now that Jonas&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:25.280
is the new Receiver of Memory, it’s his role&nbsp;
as the Giver to share this history with him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.520
Jonas spots a mark on the Giver’s&nbsp;
wrist as he moves closer towards him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:34.400
The Giver sees the same mark on Jonas’s wrist&nbsp;
as he takes his hands in his. As their hands&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.120
close together, Jonas is instantly transported&nbsp;
into a new world that he has never seen before.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.720
It’s very cold and he’s surrounded by stuff that&nbsp;
you call snow. He spots a sled and takes a ride&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:49.680
on it until he stops at the edge of a house where&nbsp;
a family is singing a Christmas song. Just then,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:54.080
Jonas is taken back to the Giver’s room. The&nbsp;
Giver tells him that he will remember the names&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.880
and emotions in time. As they walk home, the Giver&nbsp;
tells Jonas that he will learn that there is so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:03.600
much more to the world they currently live in.&nbsp;
In the evening, Mother asks about his training&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:08.240
and notices that there’s something different about&nbsp;
him. Their conversation is cut short when Father&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.880
brings Gabriel to the house. He decided to bring&nbsp;
him in to help him catch up on his development.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:18.240
Jonas spots the same mark on Gabriel’s wrist&nbsp;
and knows that this baby will be chosen too.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.960
The next day at training, they explore the&nbsp;
concept of color. Jonas shares that the first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.120
color he saw was red in Fiona’s hair while the&nbsp;
Giver tells him that his first color was yellow.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:32.480
Jonas seeps into the memories again and sees a&nbsp;
burst of colors in the sky. He’s witnessing what’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:38.080
called a sunset. When he opens his eyes again, he&nbsp;
begins to see the colors in the room. The more he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:42.800
learns about the colors, the more he will see them&nbsp;
in this world. The elders decided to get rid of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:48.000
colors because it encouraged envy. As Jonas looks&nbsp;
out the window, the mist clears up just a little&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.800
and reveals a tree. They were told that there was&nbsp;
nothing beyond the mist, but then again, they were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:58.000
told a lot of things. When morning comes, Fiona&nbsp;
finds Jonas laying on the grass and watching the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.600
sky, but unlike him, Fiona can’t see the colors&nbsp;
that he can see. Asher finds them holding hands&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:08.240
and invites them to the viewing point where they&nbsp;
can watch the drones fly. At the viewing point,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:13.520
Asher tells them that he’s seen Elsewhere. It’s&nbsp;
just a few farms and houses like the communities.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:17.840
What’s peculiar is that he saw two huge&nbsp;
rocks as if they’re forming a triangle.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:21.920
The two then ask Jonas about his job.&nbsp;
Instead of telling them, he shows them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:27.440
Jonas grabs a tray and Fiona does the same.&nbsp;
Asher backs out and goes back to his training.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.160
Meanwhile, Jonas and Fiona sit on their trays&nbsp;
and push themselves down from the viewing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:37.440
point and into the grass below. They laugh as&nbsp;
Jonas helps Fiona to her feet. The community&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:41.440
radio reminds them that it’s impolite to&nbsp;
touch people outside their family unit.

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:46.560
Meanwhile, the Chief Elder meets with the Giver&nbsp;
and asks about Jonas’s training. She informs him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:50.960
that Jonas was caught almost sharing his training&nbsp;
with friends. The Giver tells her that this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:55.120
inevitable and even he himself tried to share his&nbsp;
training with his friends when he was younger.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:59.520
She warns him to not get carried away and to&nbsp;
remember what happened to the last Receiver.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:04.320
He glares at her and tells her that the Receiver&nbsp;
had a name. When they have their training for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:09.760
the day, the Giver gives several books for Jonas&nbsp;
to read. A map slips out from one of the books.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:14.720
It’s a map of their world with a large boundary&nbsp;
called the Boundary of Memories. Jonas concludes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:19.200
that if one of them closes the boundaries, then&nbsp;
all the memories of the world will be set free.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:23.600
The Giver then leads him to the basement and&nbsp;
shows him a piano. He introduces him to music&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:28.080
and the meaning of emotions. He then reveals&nbsp;
to Jonas that the morning injections they take&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:33.760
remove their ability to feel emotions. He grabs&nbsp;
Jonas’s hand and transports him into a new memory,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:39.680
this time a medieval wedding full of food, music,&nbsp;
and dancing. When he wakes up, Jonas feels a range&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:45.600
of emotions he’s never felt before. When he goes&nbsp;
home after training, he teaches Lily how to dance.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:50.640
His parents see them dancing and look disturbed.&nbsp;
A hologram message from the Chief Elder interrupts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:55.440
their conversation. The rest of the family go out&nbsp;
and start their day while Mother remains to talk&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:55.440 --> 00:08:00.400
to the Chief Elder. The Chief Elder expresses&nbsp;
her concern if Jonas is being trained properly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:05.520
but he reassures her that she is. He lies to her&nbsp;
and tells her that they sit together and talk.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:09.920
As he goes out, he grabs an apple and uses it&nbsp;
on the morning injection instead of his arm.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:14.640
When Jonas leaves, the Chief Elder warns his&nbsp;
Mother to be more concerned about his son.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:19.360
Over the next few days, the Giver teaches&nbsp;
Jonas about everything from the ancient world.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:23.840
He shares with him various memories from&nbsp;
different people, cultures, and religions.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:26.960
He also tells him about the&nbsp;
animals that they used to have.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:31.920
He shows him every global milestone and every&nbsp;
important historical event from their past.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:36.640
Jonas feels entranced at what he’s learning.&nbsp;
Every day that he learns something,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:41.200
the more he wants to learn. He loves the old&nbsp;
world because it feels more complete somehow.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.200
At one point, the Giver feels Jonas is ready to&nbsp;
know pain. He holds his hand during a session and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:52.080
gives him a memory of some poachers killing an&nbsp;
elephant. When Jonas wakes up, he finds himself&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:56.800
crying. The Giver comforts him, reminding him&nbsp;
that there are far more painful things to come.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:01.840
Later that night, Jonas can’t sleep and&nbsp;
instead comforts Gabriel in his cradle.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:05.200
He tells him about the animals and is&nbsp;
able to show him by holding his wrist.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:10.720
At this moment, Jonas realizes that Gabriel&nbsp;
might become the new Receiver of Memory.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:15.200
He watches Fiona from her window and dreams&nbsp;
of her when he sleeps. In his dream, the two&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:20.080
of them lock lips together. Jonas tells the Giver&nbsp;
about his dream and learns that it’s a combination&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:25.440
of fantasy and reality. He explains to Jonas that&nbsp;
what he feels for Fiona is the beginning of love,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:30.560
but the elders removed love as well as the other&nbsp;
emotions. Jonas thinks about this as he rides his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:35.040
bike with Fiona the next day. She asks about&nbsp;
his training but he feels hesitant to share.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:40.640
He also feels confused about his feelings for&nbsp;
her. Later at home, he asks his family about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:45.920
the concept of love, but their explanations don’t&nbsp;
help at all. He tucks in Gabriel for the night and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:51.120
tells him that he loves him. He then shares a few&nbsp;
happy memories with him before he goes to sleep.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:55.760
The next day when Jonas arrives for training, he&nbsp;
finds the Giver on the floor. He rushes to help&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:55.760 --> 00:10:00.720
him but before the Giver could stop him, they hold&nbsp;
hands and the memories begin flooding into Jonas.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:04.960
He’s in the middle of a battlefield amidst a&nbsp;
bloody battle. His friend lays next to him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:10.640
bleeding from the chest. He fires his gun at the&nbsp;
presumed enemy and kills her. When Jonas wakes up,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:16.160
he’s horrified. He’s never felt this emotion&nbsp;
before. This is what they call pain, loss,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:20.240
and hurt. He runs away from the Giver who’s&nbsp;
telling him that he wasn’t meant to see that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:26.000
for a few more years. But it’s too late. Jonas&nbsp;
wants nothing to do with these memories anymore.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.960
The situation takes the Giver back to&nbsp;
Rosemary. She was the Receiver before Jonas.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:36.320
The Giver sees Rosemary in his own memories,&nbsp;
crying as she walks away. Meanwhile, Jonas sees&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:41.440
Asher on the community grounds. Asher finds him&nbsp;
acting peculiar and watches his friend walk away.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.680
Jonas is in a haze as he looks at the&nbsp;
children playing, unaware of the pain&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:50.480
and loss he’s feeling. Fiona approaches him&nbsp;
and he finally caves in. He tells her that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:55.280
he’s stopped taking his injections and wants to&nbsp;
quit being a Receiver. He encourages her to stop&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:55.280 --> 00:11:00.000
her injections too and soon she’ll know what he’s&nbsp;
talking about. Fiona thinks he’s nuts and insists&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.240
that he doesn’t quit his role. He then tells her&nbsp;
to meet up with him tomorrow at the fountain.

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:09.600
Jonas returns to the house at the Edge and finds&nbsp;
the Giver in the basement watching a memory.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:15.120
The Giver finally tells Jonas about Rosemary,&nbsp;
his daughter, and the Receiver before him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:19.680
She was in training for just two months when she&nbsp;
insisted that she was ready to take on the pain.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:25.280
He then showed her a memory of a mother losing&nbsp;
her child. Unfortunately, the memory was too&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:29.680
painful for her, and the next day, she went to the&nbsp;
elders and asked to be released into Elsewhere.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:34.080
Jonas thinks that it couldn’t be too bad&nbsp;
if Rosemary was only living in Elsewhere,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:38.240
but the Giver gives him a dark look and shows him&nbsp;
a hologram video of the people who were released&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:43.120
that morning. Jonas looks at the video and sees&nbsp;
his Father handling a baby from a set of twins.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:48.480
He takes the baby to a separate room and proceeds&nbsp;
to inject it on the head. There can only be one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:52.480
of the same things and so twins are separated&nbsp;
and the other one is released to Elsewhere.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:58.160
Jonas looks in horror as he watches the baby stop&nbsp;
moving. The baby dies and his Father isn’t even&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:03.040
aware of what he’s doing. He doesn’t know that&nbsp;
what he’s giving the child is a lethal injection.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:07.280
The Giver tells Jonas that the humans don’t grasp&nbsp;
the concept of death because they’ve never been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:12.240
introduced to it. It turns out, all the young and&nbsp;
old people they were “releasing to Elsewhere” were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:17.360
being killed by lethal injection. Jonas is furious&nbsp;
at the Giver and demands to know why they’ve never&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:21.920
done anything to stop this before. He tells Jonas&nbsp;
that there’s no point if these people can’t feel.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:26.880
After training, he runs to the fountain and finds&nbsp;
Fiona in pieces. She didn’t take her morning&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:31.360
injections and is now feeling overwhelmed.&nbsp;
He holds her hands and asks her about her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:37.600
emotions. He then leans in and kisses her. They&nbsp;
both feel a warm fuzzy feeling inside them. Jonas&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:42.160
tells her that there is more to what they’re&nbsp;
living in, but Fiona leaves. When he gets home,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:47.040
he doesn’t join his family at dinner, deeply&nbsp;
concerning his Mother. He asks where Gabriel is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:51.680
and it turns out that Gabriel has failed his test&nbsp;
for maturity and will be released into Elsewhere.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:56.400
Despite his parents thinking this was a good&nbsp;
thing, Jonas knows better. This is a death&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:56.400 --> 00:13:01.600
sentence. He packs his bag and escapes through&nbsp;
his window only to be approached by Asher.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:06.880
Asher questions his peculiar behavior and stops&nbsp;
him from escaping. He tries to barricade Jonas but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:11.360
he punches him out of the way. He then gets back&nbsp;
on his bike and rides all the way to the Edge.

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:17.360
When Jonas arrives, he seeks help from the&nbsp;
Giver, who happily assists him. They form a plan&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:22.160
together. Jonas will take Gabriel and travel to&nbsp;
the boundary of memories so that all the memories&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:26.400
of humanity will be free and the Giver will stay&nbsp;
here and help guide the people whose memories have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:31.280
just been restored. He asks the Giver why he never&nbsp;
did anything all these years if he had the map,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:34.640
but it turns out the Giver was just waiting&nbsp;
for someone like Jonas to come along.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:40.800
Meanwhile, Jonas’s Mother reports to the Chief&nbsp;
Elder after Asher reported Jonas’s escape to her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:45.920
They bring up Jonas’s activity from the past year&nbsp;
and begin tracking him down. Back at the Edge,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:50.400
a hologram transmission announces that&nbsp;
Jonas is missing and is being tracked down.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:55.040
The Giver hands him the map and gives him one&nbsp;
last memory to give him courage. Jonas rides&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:59.920
his bike to the Nurturing Center and approaches&nbsp;
Fiona. He manages to convince her to take him to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:04.720
the restricted floor where Gabriel is being held&nbsp;
together with the other Uncertains. Meanwhile,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:09.440
soldiers are already gathering outside the center.&nbsp;
Jonas tells her that he’s leaving the community&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:15.120
tonight and taking Gabriel with him. He asks Fiona&nbsp;
to join him but she refuses, saying that she just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:19.840
can’t leave her family behind. He promises to&nbsp;
come back for her and they share one last kiss.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:25.040
Jonas takes Gabriel as Fiona takes another cradle&nbsp;
and lures the security away while he escapes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:31.200
Jonas runs outside and steals one of the security&nbsp;
motorcycles as Fiona is finally caught. He rides&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:36.160
all the way to the Edge as more security chases&nbsp;
him. As he’s nearing the end of their property, he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:40.640
takes a deep breath and takes the plunge towards&nbsp;
the unknown. He disappears into the mist and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:46.160
lands into unknown terrain below. Since the elders&nbsp;
can’t track him now, they take in Asher and Fiona&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:50.960
for interrogation. Meanwhile, Jonas has reached&nbsp;
the desert and is traveling at top speed towards&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:56.320
the border. Back at the headquarters, the elders&nbsp;
learn about Jonas’s plans and arrest the Giver.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:56.320 --> 00:15:00.960
The Giver wakes up in prison together with Fiona&nbsp;
while the elders hold a Ceremony of Loss for Jonas&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:05.520
to try and make up for his disappearance.&nbsp;
The Chief Elder reveals to Asher that Jonas&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:09.680
is likely still alive and assigns him a secret&nbsp;
mission to track him down and get rid of him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:14.560
Asher accepts the assignment but feels conflicting&nbsp;
feelings since Jonas is his best friend.

00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:19.840
Beyond the mist, Jonas has now abandoned&nbsp;
his motorcycle and has started walking.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:23.760
Just then, Asher’s drone appears and he begs&nbsp;
his friend to trust him and let them go.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:28.880
Jonas starts running but the drone’s magnet&nbsp;
pulls them up and away. Asher then flies the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:33.200
drone to a river and drops them. He doesn’t&nbsp;
have the heart to kill his friend and instead&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:38.240
releases them into the water so that they could&nbsp;
escape. He waits until he sees Jonas resurfaces&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:43.520
from the water before flying away. The Chief Elder&nbsp;
contacts Asher and for the first time in his life,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:48.640
Asher lies and tells him that Jonas is dead.&nbsp;
Meanwhile, Jonas and Gabriel get out of the water&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:53.200
and continue their journey towards the border.&nbsp;
Despite wanting to give up hundreds of times,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:58.400
the memory of Fiona keeps Jonas going. He had to&nbsp;
make it so that he could go back and rescue her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:02.960
Meanwhile, Jonas’s Mother takes Fiona out of her&nbsp;
cell and has made the arrangements for her release&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:08.320
to Elsewhere. Fiona tells Mother that she now&nbsp;
understands what Jonas has been talking about.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:12.400
She’s felt things she’s never felt before and&nbsp;
she knows there’s so much more to the empty lives&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:17.680
they’ve been living. Back at the beyond, Jonas&nbsp;
and Gabriel have reached the snowy mountains.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:20.720
They fight against the bitter cold as&nbsp;
they find their way towards the borders.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:26.320
Jonas checks his map. The tower marking the&nbsp;
border should be around here somewhere. As&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:31.360
they continue their journey, Fiona is accompanied&nbsp;
to the chamber room where she will be released.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:36.240
The Giver arrives at the other side of the room&nbsp;
and joins the elders. He begs the elders to put&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:41.120
a stop to this charade and to finally release the&nbsp;
people from this prison. The Chief Elder retorts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:45.760
back saying that they’re delusional if they think&nbsp;
bringing back love can help them. Love can easily&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:51.120
turn to passion and then passion into contempt and&nbsp;
then murder. People are weak and selfish. Out of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:55.280
all the people, the Giver should know best that&nbsp;
when people are given the power of choice, they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:55.280 --> 00:17:00.400
always choose wrong. Meanwhile, Jonas wakes up in&nbsp;
the midst of the snow, having collapsed from the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:06.640
cold, and cradles Gabriel in his arms. He sees the&nbsp;
sled, just like in the memory, and climbs on it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:11.040
They slide down the snowy hill and finally reach&nbsp;
the tower indicating the border. They pass through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:14.720
the force field and millions of memories are&nbsp;
released just as they’re about to place the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:19.920
injection on Fiona. Jonas and Gabriel arrive at&nbsp;
the house, feeling ecstatic to know that it’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:25.040
real. And in his heart, Jonas knows that Fiona&nbsp;
is safe and they will see each other very soon.
