00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:21.029
Welcome to Storyflix. In this video, we will
explain the second part of Squid Game. Squid

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.990
Game is a Netflix original series about people
who have all struggled financially in life.

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:30.391
They were then invited to play a mysterious
survival competition with deadly twists. How

00:00:30.391 --> 00:00:36.900
terrible is this bloody game? Let's find out
in Squid Game, Part 2. Squid Game Part 2 begins

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.690
in a large room where players who have completed
the cotton candy challenge are gathered. The

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.650
committee came in to bring some soju and boiled
eggs, then ordered the participants to queue

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:50.519
up one by one. Because they were still hungry
and thirsty, Deok Su and his men entered the

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:54.500
queue again. It turned out that the committee
had prepared the right number of snacks for

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.360
the participants. So that some participants
did not get food and drink. A participant

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.049
who was angry because he did not get a snack
then came to Deok Su. But he is not an opponent

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.619
for Deok Su. Doek Su even beat him until he
was battered and dead. Suddenly, the incident

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:14.750
took everyone by surprise. Gi Hoon then asked
the committee to take firm action on Deok

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.649
Su. But the organizers of the game don't care
what happens outside of the game. The death

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:24.759
of the participant made the prize money increase
because the number of participants was decreasing.

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:29.329
This then gave an idea to Deok Su. He plans
to kill the other contestants to have less

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:34.439
competition and secure his chances of winning.
Deok Su then arranges a plan with his men

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.520
and intends to carry out their actions while
everyone is asleep. However, the other participants

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.829
had also anticipated the possibility of an
attack from Deok Su and his men. Unknowingly,

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:48.729
they too have been divided into several groups
trying to cooperate and protect their group

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:53.979
members. On the other hand, several committee
members were seen working with one participant.

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:57.810
They were about to do something that the game
organizers didn't know. One committee even

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.859
manipulated the CCTV camera footage in the
control room. It turned out that the participant

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:06.610
was a doctor who worked with the committee
to perform autopsies on the bodies of the

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.300
eliminated participants. They took vital organs
from the participants' bodies and then sold

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.410
them on the black market so they could earn
money. In return, the doctor gets information

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.600
about the next game to prepare himself and
have a great chance of winning it. In the

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:24.200
evening, the participants were asked to rest,
and the lights were turned off. After all

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.880
the lights went out, Deok Su and his men immediately
carried out their cruel actions. The huge

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.210
room in an instant turned into a slaughter
site filled with screams of pain and loud

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.709
crashing sounds. The darkness and completeness
made it difficult for the participants to

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:42.569
save themselves. After making sure Sang Woo
and Ali are okay, Gi Hoon and the two then

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:47.710
look for Il Nam. But the old man was not in
his bed. Apparently, Il Nam had managed to

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:52.180
save himself by climbing into the top bed.
He then shouted for the participants not to

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.849
kill each other. After the old man said this,
suddenly the light came on, then the committee

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:01.780
members entered the room and secured the situation.
The big room looked very messy and horrific,

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.080
with corpses and blood splattered everywhere.
The committee acted quickly to evacuate the

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:11.020
participants' bodies. After the fateful incident,
the participants were then gathered in another

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:15.319
room and asked to form groups of ten people.
Having received information about the game

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:19.490
today, the doctor then informed Deok Su and
joined his group. While the other participants

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:23.459
chose their groups randomly, and Gi Hoon chose
his group consisting of his closest friends

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:28.540
during the game, such as Sang Woo, Ali, and
Il Nam. It turns out that the game in this

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.549
round is a tug of war. But not like the usual
tug of war. The participants will do tug of

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:38.069
war above a height so that the losing team
will immediately fall from a height and die.

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:41.090
After knowing the game they will be playing,
Gi Hoon is worried because there are three

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:46.310
women and one grandfather whose physical condition
is not so good in his team. Gi Hoon's team

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:51.049
then became an easy target for other teams
that looked stronger. Long story short, Gi

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:54.690
Hoon's team finally got their turn to compete
against other participating teams who looked

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.890
stronger than them. Sang Woo had already felt
desperate because his team members weren't

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:03.340
as strong as their opponents. But then, Il
Nam tells some tips and tricks in a tug of

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:08.290
war that they can do to win the match this
time. They need to work together and cultivate

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:13.159
a high sense of trust among team members.
Il Nam's trick proved successful early in

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:17.180
the game. However, because the difference
in the physical strength of Gi Hoon's team

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:22.460
and the opposing team is quite far, finally
Gi Hoon's team is getting more and more pressed

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:27.360
and has difficulty turning the situation around.
At crucial moments, Sang Woo asks his team

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.750
to take reckless actions by taking three steps
forward. If the timing is right, they will

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:36.169
knock down the opposing team and come out
victorious. Gi Hoon and the others seem to

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:40.000
be indecisive, but they finally decide to
follow Sang Woo's words because they believe

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.650
in him. After trying their hardest, Gi Hoon's
team managed to turn things around and win

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:49.630
the match. After the tug of war ended, the
number of remaining participants became 40,

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:53.030
and the nominal amount of prize money is now
doubled.

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.840
The participants' bodies who were eliminated
from the tug of war game were collected, and

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:01.620
the committee called the doctor to perform
an organ harvesting operation. This time,

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:06.400
Joon Ho was assigned by a committee to participate
in organ delivery. There, Joon Ho could only

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.530
witness the cruelty of the organizers who
used the participants' bodies to get money

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:15.000
without being able to do anything. As usual,
the doctor asked the committee for a reward

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.340
for completing his task. But organizers say
they have not been notified by the organizers

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:23.800
of the games to be played next. Suddenly the
doctor panicked and got angry because Deok

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.931
Su would kill him if he couldn't provide any
information regarding the next game. The doctor

00:05:27.931 --> 00:05:31.750
then attacked one of the committee members
and killed him with a surgical knife. After

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:35.940
that, he ran away from the committee, down
the winding dark alleys until he arrived at

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:40.250
the arena of the curry game. A committee who
managed to catch up to him then cornered the

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:43.960
doctor and told him not to act rashly because
he didn't want Frontman to know what they

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:48.970
were doing. However, unbeknownst to them,
Frontman already knew all about their actions

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:54.050
and did not hesitate to kill the corrupt committee
members. After that, Frontman took the doctor's

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:58.099
life. Frontman didn't care about the corrupt
actions of some of his subordinates. But he

00:05:58.099 --> 00:06:03.110
highly values ??justice and equality in the
game. Therefore, Frontman cannot tolerate

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:07.860
any participant receiving special treatment
from the committee or game organizer. On the

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:11.990
other hand, Joon Ho and one of the organizers
walk down the hall and infiltrate one of the

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:16.169
secret passages that have been prepared for
organ delivery. After successfully reaching

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:20.430
the end of the secret passage, the committee
suddenly pointed a knife at Joon Ho's neck.

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:24.190
It turns out that they have been observing
his suspicious movements all this time. Having

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:28.370
been caught, Joon Ho takes off his mask, but
he manages to threaten the committee and shoots

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:32.419
him in the head. After successfully killing
a committee member, Joon Ho infiltrates the

00:06:32.419 --> 00:06:36.889
Frontman's room and intends to find information
about his brother's whereabouts. On the other

00:06:36.889 --> 00:06:41.770
hand, Frontman and his men comb the entire
area to hunt down corrupt organizers. Frontman

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:46.030
and his men managed to find a secret passage
that Joon Ho had passed and found the body

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:50.440
of a committee member there. He then examined
the committee's corpse and found a bullet

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:54.180
casing in his forehead. From the bullet, he
was able to confirm that the bullet came from

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:58.479
a police gun. Frontman then mobilizes all
his men to hunt down the intruder throughout

00:06:58.479 --> 00:07:03.190
the game area. Meanwhile, Joon Ho, who was
in the Frontman's room, checked room after

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:08.849
room warily. He finally finds a slightly hidden
archive room. There were many shelves filled

00:07:08.849 --> 00:07:13.099
with files from the players who had followed
the game several years ago. He then checked

00:07:13.099 --> 00:07:17.680
the files the same year his brother disappeared.
As he had predicted, he received information

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:22.550
about his brother, who had indeed been a participant
in the game. It's time to start a new game.

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:26.410
The participants were shocked by the horrific
sight of the bodies of several committee members

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:30.810
and the doctor being hanged on their way to
the location of the game. The game organizers

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:35.080
issued an official apology and warned that
what happened to the doctor and the organizers

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:40.060
could happen to all of them if they cheated.
The participants were then asked to pair up.

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:45.130
Since the number of players remaining is thirty-nine,
one person cannot participate in the game.

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:49.190
Everyone is looking for their respective partners,
but no one wants to partner with Il Nam because

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:53.140
they think they will play a game that requires
physical strength, and with his weak physical

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:58.140
condition, they are afraid that they can't
win the match. Gi Hoon, who feels sorry, finally

00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:02.930
chooses Il Nam to be his partner. Everyone
has got their respective partners except Min

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:07.520
Ryong. She was immediately taken away by the
committee to another place. After arriving

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:11.949
at the game location, the participants are
given ten marbles each. The players are given

00:08:11.949 --> 00:08:15.590
thirty minutes to pick up their partner's
marbles, and the player who manages to get

00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:19.189
twenty marbles at the end of the game, is
declared to have passed this game and has

00:08:19.189 --> 00:08:23.200
the right to continue the game in the next
round. There is no specific rule about how

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:27.900
the participants take the marbles belonging
to their opponents. They may use various means,

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:32.250
and the committee will only supervise them.
Gi Hoon has to be extra patient to explain

00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:36.539
the procedure for this game to Il Nam. Because
Il Nam is senile, he just walks around and

00:08:36.539 --> 00:08:40.979
wastes time, ignoring the games that are going
on. This makes Gi Hoon angry and yells at

00:08:40.979 --> 00:08:45.951
him. Finally, Il Nam came to his senses and
started playing. Gi Hoon and Il Nam play a

00:08:45.951 --> 00:08:50.160
simple game where they only have to guess
the number of marbles in their hands, whether

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:55.070
odd or even. Unexpectedly, Il Nam managed
to guess several times correctly so that his

00:08:55.070 --> 00:09:00.060
marbles increased and Gi Hoon's marbles decreased.
Gi Hoon panicked even more because the committee

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:04.121
monitoring them was getting ready to fire
bullets at him. On the other hand, Sang Woo

00:09:04.121 --> 00:09:08.910
is paired with Ali. They both play a fair
game, and Ali almost wins the game for getting

00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:14.519
more marbles than Sang Woo. Ali, who is soft-hearted,
feels sorry and bad for Sang Woo. But Sang

00:09:14.519 --> 00:09:19.250
Woo scolds him and says that one of them will
surely die. Sang Woo, who had lost, was playing

00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:23.820
cunningly. He took advantage of Ali's innocence
and exchanged Ali's marbles for the stones

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:29.120
he had collected. Sang Woo finally came out
victorious. On the other hand, Sa Byeok is

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:34.300
paired with a girl named Ji Yeong. The two
women instead decided to have a chat. Ji Yeong

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:38.190
then realizes that Sa Byeok deserves to be
the winner because she is fighting to stay

00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:42.500
alive for her sister in the orphanage, while
Ji Yeong has no one else since she killed

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:48.089
her cruel father. Ji Yeong deliberately succumbs
so that Sa Byeok can win the game this time.

00:09:48.089 --> 00:09:53.650
Back to Gi Hoon and Il Nam, the two continue
to play until Gi Hoon's marbles are only one

00:09:53.650 --> 00:09:58.470
left. On the last chance, Gi Hoon almost lost
because his guess was wrong. But as it turns

00:09:58.470 --> 00:10:03.420
out, Il Nam's senile disease recurs, and the
old man forgets his guess. Gi Hoon then took

00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:08.120
advantage of this, and the incident continued
until he managed to turn things around. Gi

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:13.000
Hoon now has many marbles, and Il Nam only
has one marble. Time goes on and is almost

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.579
up, but Il Nam is stalling for time. The old
man then tells Gi Hoon to play one more round

00:10:17.579 --> 00:10:22.290
risking all the marbles they have. But Gi
Hoon refuses because Il Nam only has one marble,

00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:26.850
while he has nineteen marbles. Il Nam then
reveals that all this time, he only pretended

00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:31.670
to be senile and knew all of Gi Hoon's tricks.
But he deliberately let Gi Hoon fool him.

00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:36.170
Gi Hoon immediately feels guilty to Il Nam
for deceiving him. The man felt ashamed of

00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:40.990
himself for fooling an old geezer for his
benefit. Il Nam did not mind this. He took

00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:45.760
Gi Hoon's hand and gave his one last marble.
He then expressed his gratitude to Gi Hoon,

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:50.230
because he always cared for him during the
game. Il Nam then hugged Gi Hoon tightly and

00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:53.959
said that he was very happy in the last days
of his life thanks to him, who was always

00:10:53.959 --> 00:10:58.810
by his side. Thirty minutes had passed, and
game time was up. The participants who did

00:10:58.810 --> 00:11:03.610
not have marbles, such as Il Nam, Ali, and
Ji Yeong, were declared unsuccessful and eliminated

00:11:03.610 --> 00:11:09.170
by being shot dead. The second part of the
Squid Game ends. The second part of the Squid

00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:14.060
Game showed Gi Hoon and Sa Byeok, devastated
because their partner had to be eliminated.

00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:18.339
Sadness is also etched on Sang Woo's face
because he was forced to trick Ali to continue

00:11:18.339 --> 00:11:22.470
the game. What will happen to Gi Hoon and
the other participants who are still alive?

00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:26.480
And will Joon Ho be able to uncover who the
mastermind behind the ruthless game syndicate

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:28.110
is? Wait for the next part, here on Storyflix.
