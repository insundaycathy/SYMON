00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.840
Welcome to Moviecaps.&nbsp;

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:06.160
Today I will show you a Drama&nbsp;
film from 2017, titled Gifted.&nbsp;

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.640
Spoilers ahead!
Watch out and take care.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.960
Frank Adler is telling his niece,&nbsp;
Mary, to get ready for school.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:18.480
He tells her that he is making her a special&nbsp;
breakfast. Mary is reluctant and brings up excuses&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.280
like who will look after her monocular cat,&nbsp;
Fred. Frank tells her that Fred will be alright.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.040
She asks for the special breakfast&nbsp;
she was told about and Frank just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.880
shows her a box of Kellogg’s cereal with&nbsp;
special written on it, to her dismay.&nbsp;

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.840
Frank sees her off at the bus stand, where Mary&nbsp;
proceeds to go to school for the first time.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.280
Roberta, who is Frank’s neighbour, follows him&nbsp;
back to his house. She expresses her concern&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.160
regarding Mary attending school. She thinks&nbsp;
something may happen to her. Frank looks nervous.&nbsp;

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.560
Later, Mary is at school and looks&nbsp;
like she'd rather be anywhere but here.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.680
Her teacher, Bonnie, wanders around the class&nbsp;
asking the children simple math problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.760
Mary looks at her and the rest of the&nbsp;
class with disdain, as she thinks Bonnie’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.680
questions are simple. Teacher starts asking Mary&nbsp;
comparatively complex questions. Mary answers them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.720
easily. As the questions get more difficult,&nbsp;
particularly when reaching multiplication,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:16.240
Mary hesitates for a bit, which Bonnie takes as&nbsp;
her cue to stop. After a few moments of silence,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.120
Mary answers the multiplication question&nbsp;
correctly. Bonnie grabs the calculator to check,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:26.240
it’s correct. She feels perplexed and&nbsp;
knows that Mary isn’t just a regular kid.&nbsp;

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.800
The principal, Miss Davis is introduced to&nbsp;
the first graders. The class treats her with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:36.080
respect. Mary behaves rather casually and yells&nbsp;
at Davis and Bonnie to call Frank and tell him to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:41.520
get her out of here. Later that day, Frank shows&nbsp;
up to pick up Mary. Bonnie has a word with him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.120
She tries to make him realize&nbsp;
that Mary isn’t an ordinary child.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.240
Frank waves her off, telling her it’s just the&nbsp;
Jakow Trachtenberg method which Mary used to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.760
calculate the math questions which Bonnie asked&nbsp;
in class. Bonnie says Mary is only seven, to which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.840
Frank responds that he learned the same method&nbsp;
when he was eight, meaning it isn’t a big deal.&nbsp;

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.200
Bonnie later searches up the Jakow Trachtenberg&nbsp;
method and looks into it, feeling quite impressed.&nbsp;

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.240
Frank is working on a boat. Mary asks him&nbsp;
if they can take the boat for a test drive.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.560
They spend time together at the beach.&nbsp;
They converse about different things,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.280
and Frank tells Mary that her mother&nbsp;
would want her to make friends.&nbsp;

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.280
Mary brings Fred to school and&nbsp;
shows him to her classmates.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:27.360
She tells them he has only one eye. The kids ask&nbsp;
her, how did he lose his eye? Mary responds saying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.680
she doesn't know about that because she found him&nbsp;
like this in the trash and in a way, rescued him.&nbsp;

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.600
Bonnie grows closer to Mary. She hands her&nbsp;
additional homework, knowing she’d finish her work&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.720
quicker than most students. Mary smiles at Bonnie&nbsp;
and Bonnie returns her smile with an affectionate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:48.240
one of her own. They bond well in class.
Bonnie searches more about the Adler family,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:53.120
first looking into Frank Adler’s details, but&nbsp;
her search does not yield any fruitful results.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.400
She ends up reading about Frank’s sister Diane&nbsp;
Adler. Diane is a child prodigy, excellent at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:04.720
mathematics. MIT professor, Seymour Shankland,&nbsp;
calls her exceptional, saying she has an exquisite&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:10.000
mind, a mind that could help the world. As Bonnie&nbsp;
reads further, she finds out that Diane ended&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.880
herself aged twenty-seven. She left behind a&nbsp;
daughter named Mary with her brother, Frank.&nbsp;

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:21.360
Bonnie shows up to meet Frank at their local bar,&nbsp;
Ferg. Frank opens up to her. He tells her that he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.440
was running late for a date when Diane showed&nbsp;
up unannounced at his place with a baby Mary.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:30.880
She told Frank she needed to talk to him. Frank&nbsp;
dismissed her saying he’ll listen to her when he’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.840
back from his date. That night, when he returned&nbsp;
home he found Mary on the couch and Diane on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.320
bathroom floor. Though it isn’t entirely his&nbsp;
fault, he still thinks he should’ve known.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:46.160
Bonnie asks about any other family members. Frank&nbsp;
replies that Mary's biological father didn't last&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:51.680
a month, he abandoned Diane. His mother is&nbsp;
very strict, she is an uncompromising woman,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.120
British through and through.
Mary is on the bus to school. She&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:00.640
notices her classmate climbing the bus, holding a&nbsp;
well-made project. She feels concerned at first,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.120
thinking that her project isn’t good enough.&nbsp;
The little boy is trying to make his way.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.360
A twelve-year-old bullies him, making&nbsp;
the poor boy trip and break his work.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.520
The bully along with the rest of the kids&nbsp;
start laughing and teasing him. Mary comes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:18.400
to his rescue and tells the kids to stop it.&nbsp;
She hits the bully in the face with a book.&nbsp;

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.680
Frank is later walking into Mary’s&nbsp;
school as he passes by the bully,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.800
who is bleeding from his nose. He immediately&nbsp;
checks up on Mary, making sure that she’s alright.&nbsp;

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:32.080
The principal, Davis, makes Frank understand that&nbsp;
beating people up isn’t allowed, Frank tells her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.000
that he’ll make sure Mary understands that,&nbsp;
though he is proud of her for standing up to a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.280
bully. Principal says she would like to have Mary&nbsp;
study at the Oaks Academy for Gifted Education,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.160
where she can be educated at a&nbsp;
level that matches her capabilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:50.800
Frank brings up financial concerns. She guarantees&nbsp;
a full-ride scholarship for Mary. Frank turns the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:56.000
offer down, saying that Mary should be treated&nbsp;
like a normal kid and sent to a regular school.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.760
Bonnie asks him if he is sure about his&nbsp;
decision, to which he says he doesn’t know.&nbsp;

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.280
Mary apologizes to her&nbsp;
classmates for her behaviour.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.760
She and the rest of the class applaud&nbsp;
Justin, the little boy who is her classmate,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:13.120
telling him that his zoo was the best art project.
Frank and Mary reach home to find her grandmother,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.440
Evelyn waiting at their doorstep. Evelyn&nbsp;
brings her a fancy laptop with a book&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:21.520
about advanced algebra by Charles Zimmer.&nbsp;
Mary tells her with disinterest that she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:26.080
has already read the book and is now covering&nbsp;
differential equations. Frank makes her thank&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:30.720
Evelyn. Evelyn is not satisfied with Frank’s&nbsp;
living conditions and calls him out for it.&nbsp;

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:35.680
Frank and Evelyn meet for lunch. She says&nbsp;
she is concerned for Mary and wants her to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:39.600
live in a better environment. She warns&nbsp;
Frank that authorities will be involved.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:44.400
Frank tells her that Diane would not want&nbsp;
her to have custody of Mary. Evelyn calls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:49.040
Mary's mother Diane and Frank weak. She subtly&nbsp;
tells him that this matter is going to court.

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:53.600
Frank and Mary hang out together, she&nbsp;
asks him questions about God and faith.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:58.640
He says he has his own opinion, which could be&nbsp;
wrong, so he does not have the right to spoil&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:04.240
her opinion. Mary mentions Roberta. He says that&nbsp;
Roberta has faith and she loves her very much.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:08.800
He tells her that he knows that everyone will end&nbsp;
up together and that's what matters in the end.&nbsp;

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:14.160
Roberta proves that she cares deeply for them by&nbsp;
appearing in court to assist Frank in obtaining&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:19.040
custody of Mary against his mother. It becomes&nbsp;
clear that Evelyn plans to take Mary with her to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:24.880
Massachusetts. Frank wants her to stay with him.
Later, Frank asks Roberta to watch Mary for the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:29.120
night. Roberta agrees, mentioning that&nbsp;
she is just a neighbour and not a blood&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.960
relative or someone whose opinion would&nbsp;
be valued, but she loves Mary very much.&nbsp;

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:37.120
Mary spends the night at Roberta's,&nbsp;
singing with her and having a great time.&nbsp;

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:42.640
Bonnie and Frank meet at the bar. She explains to&nbsp;
him that it was not her who leaked the information&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:48.000
to Davis. They get closer over drinks and have&nbsp;
interesting conversations. Bonnie tells him that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.760
she can not afford to be intimate with him,&nbsp;
but eventually they spend the night together.&nbsp;

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:56.800
Mary is searching for a DVD at Frank's&nbsp;
place. She finds Bonnie sneaking out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:00.720
of Frank's room and gets cheeky about&nbsp;
it. Frank finds out about this and gets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:05.600
frustrated saying he can't have his own life&nbsp;
for even some time. She gets upset and leaves.&nbsp;

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:09.200
Later, Frank apologizes to&nbsp;
Mary and they reconcile.&nbsp;

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:14.960
Roberta is slamming Frank for his irresponsible&nbsp;
behaviour, as he checks his mail outside and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:18.560
finds out that Mary is going to be spending&nbsp;
two days in Boston with her grandmother.&nbsp;

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:23.520
When Mary visits Boston with her&nbsp;
grandmother. She sees family photos,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:26.400
including pictures of her mother&nbsp;
and grandmother when she was young.&nbsp;

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:29.840
Back in Florida, Bonnie and&nbsp;
Frank become even closer.&nbsp;

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:35.440
Evelyn takes Mary to university and tells her&nbsp;
about the Seven Millennium Problems. Mary is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:40.400
shown a picture of Grigori Perelman who worked&nbsp;
on the Poincare Conjecture. Evelyn reminisces how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:44.320
Diane could have also been honoured and had her&nbsp;
picture up on the wall if she had finished solving&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:49.520
the Navier Stokes equation. Mary expresses her&nbsp;
wish to be featured on the wall someday as well.&nbsp;

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:54.480
She is handed a difficult equation to solve by&nbsp;
professor Shankland. After noticing that she is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:59.360
unable to solve it for quite some time, he tells&nbsp;
Evelyn maybe Mary isn’t that capable after all.&nbsp;

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:03.680
Evelyn is walking furiously with her,&nbsp;
regretting coming to Shankland in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:07.760
first place when Mary tells her that the&nbsp;
equation was wrong and hence, unsolvable.

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:13.440
They head back to Shankland and the equation is&nbsp;
corrected by Mary. She solves it till the end,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:18.000
leaving Shankland feeling overwhelmed.
When they are back home, Mary tells Frank&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.480
that although Evelyn is nice, she does not want&nbsp;
to live with her. He promises her that she will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:27.680
not go anywhere. Mary meets a social worker (Pat),&nbsp;
who asks her different questions about her life.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:32.240
Mary mentions watching ultimate fighting&nbsp;
with Frank. She also tells her that he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:36.640
promised to keep her around and that he’s a&nbsp;
good guy. Pat asks her why she thinks that,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:40.960
to which she responds that Frank wanted her since&nbsp;
the beginning, irrespective of her smartness.&nbsp;

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:47.200
Mary’s biological father is brought to court.&nbsp;
He wants Evelyn to have Mary’s custody. Mary’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:51.280
father is embarrassed by Frank’s attorney, who&nbsp;
makes him realize that he doesn’t even know his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:56.000
daughter’s middle name and he has never seen her&nbsp;
in real life. Frank wins this round in court.&nbsp;

00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:01.040
He walks her to her car. She tells him that&nbsp;
she doesn’t like being at odds with her son.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:06.480
Frank says they’ve always been at odds.
Mary locks herself and cries hysterically because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:11.520
her deadbeat father does not come to see her while&nbsp;
he is in town. Later Frank drives to the hospital&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:17.040
with Mary and Roberta. They wait together for the&nbsp;
birth of a baby boy. Frank tells Mary that she was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:21.760
born just like this and that everyone was ecstatic&nbsp;
about her birth. He tells her that he broke the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:26.640
news of Mary’s birth to everyone. Mary celebrates&nbsp;
happily with the families in the hospital.&nbsp;

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:32.800
Later, when Evelyn testifies in court. Frank’s&nbsp;
attorney notices her reference towards baseball.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:36.720
He and Evelyn engage in a heated discussion&nbsp;
regarding Diane never being allowed to do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:41.360
anything except for studying mathematics. She&nbsp;
never played sports or lived a normal life.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:47.360
Frank’s attorney mentions Paul, Diane’s first&nbsp;
love at seventeen. Paul and Diane ran away to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:52.800
a resort in Vermont for skiing. He antagonizes&nbsp;
Evelyn for filing a lawsuit against him, pressing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:58.240
kidnapping charges and making Diane distraught&nbsp;
leading to her attempted self-killing in 1999.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:02.560
Evelyn insists that it was nothing major and that&nbsp;
she tried her best to be a good mother to Diane.&nbsp;

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:06.880
Frank testifies and says he is&nbsp;
a freelancer, he repairs boats.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:13.200
Evelyn’s attorney brings up concerns regarding&nbsp;
Mary’s healthcare, education, and life. Frank&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:17.760
insists that he wants her to live like a normal&nbsp;
kid. The attorney also brings up how Mary&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:22.720
assaulted the kid bully in school and how he once&nbsp;
assaulted a man. Frank says it was self-defence&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:26.720
against a drunk man in a bar and admits spending&nbsp;
a night in jail because of the incident.&nbsp;

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:32.560
Later that evening, Frank’s attorney suggests&nbsp;
handing Mary over to a foster family temporarily.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:36.480
When she turns twelve, she can make a decision&nbsp;
in court regarding her living situation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:42.720
The foster family resides in Tampa. Frank can&nbsp;
visit her easily as it’s only thirty minutes away.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:46.160
Evelyn would get visiting rights&nbsp;
too. Feeling out of options,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:50.800
he sends Mary off to live in Tampa. She&nbsp;
doesn’t take it easy, she cries and begs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:54.240
Frank not to leave her alone, reminding&nbsp;
him that he promised he wouldn’t leave her.&nbsp;

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:59.760
Roberta and Frank grieve over Mary’s absence.&nbsp;
Later, Frank tells Bonnie that he thought&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:03.920
about handing Mary over to child services&nbsp;
many times but could never let her go.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:07.920
He blames himself for the mess.
He tries to visit Mary but is told&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:14.080
by the foster father that she doesn’t want to see&nbsp;
him. Frank is heartbroken. Roberta comforts him.&nbsp;

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:19.040
Bonnie notices a poster of adoptable pets with&nbsp;
Fred’s picture on it. She sends it to Frank,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:24.160
who frantically drives over to Animal Services and&nbsp;
manages to save Fred along with two other cats.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:28.000
Evelyn is the one who put Fred up&nbsp;
for adoption in the first place.&nbsp;

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.080
Frank and Roberta rush to visit Mary and&nbsp;
succeed in getting her back when Frank shows&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:36.560
Evelyn the documents proving that Diane did in&nbsp;
fact, finish the proof for the Navier Stokes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:40.960
equation. He tells Evelyn that Diane wanted&nbsp;
this to be published after her mother’s death.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:47.680
Meaning Evelyn did suppress Diane's wishes.
Frank and Mary end up reconciling and are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:50.400
more than happy to be together&nbsp;
as they drive off with Roberta.&nbsp;

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:54.720
Evelyn looks at the tear-stained notes with&nbsp;
doodles sketched on them and starts crying.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:55.280 --> 00:12:01.200
She calls MIT and gets in contact with Shankland.
Mary attends university, after which Frank picks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:06.080
her up. They talk in the car. He hands her&nbsp;
a book by René Descartes about existence.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:10.960
She jokes with him about it. Frank drops her&nbsp;
off at the park where she joins other girl&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:15.280
scouts and plays with them happily. Frank&nbsp;
smiles warmly in the distance at Bonnie.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.600
The End.
Thank you&nbsp;&nbsp;
