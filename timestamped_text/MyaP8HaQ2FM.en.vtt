00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.760
The movie begins on a cold night in a mining town.&nbsp;
An elder worker finds a white cream-like substance&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.720
bubbling out of the ground. He reluctantly&nbsp;
tastes it and finds it very satisfying.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.560
As another worker comes by, he laughs&nbsp;
at the man for eating the snow.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:18.400
He then joins the older man and they&nbsp;
both strangely can’t stop eating it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:24.640
What is that sublime edible substance? What&nbsp;
makes it so addictive? This is Movie Shortens.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:30.400
Follow us today to a sci-fi horror film titled:&nbsp;
The Stuff. Be aware: there are spoilers!
&nbsp;

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.200
Following the opening credits, we meet with a&nbsp;
boy named Jason who is waking up in the middle of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:40.720
the night feeling hungry. As he opens the fridge&nbsp;
looking for food, he sees some ice-cream moving.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:45.600
He is shocked and steps away as his dad walks&nbsp;
in. Jason tries to explain to his dad that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.280
ice-cream was just alive, only to get scolded and&nbsp;
sent back to his room for talking nonsense. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:56.000
father then enjoys a cup of ice-cream himself.
At this point, we learn that the substance at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.960
the beginning is marketed as “The Stuff”.&nbsp;
Celebs also join the marketing campaigns of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.400
this surprisingly tasty dessert. Due to the&nbsp;
incredible benefits of “The Stuff” namely:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.600
no calories, very creamy and filling, it&nbsp;
holds the dominant position in the ice-cream&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:17.200
market. "The Stuff" quickly becomes a national&nbsp;
craze, drastically damaging ice cream sales.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.320
The leaders of the ice-cream industry decide to&nbsp;
hire David, a former FBI agent, to investigate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.360
what this “Stuff” is and how it’s made. 
Back to Jason’s family, it is revealed that his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.280
whole family is obsessed with “The Stuff” except&nbsp;
for the boy, who never tries it. His mom buys them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.320
loads and places it all in the fridge even making&nbsp;
him eat it for breakfast. Jason mentions that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.280
stuff had been moving all by itself the night&nbsp;
before but the family doesn’t listen to him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.720
Jason gets angry as the family starts to isolate&nbsp;
him more. The Stuff appears all around and his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.720
family has a strong draw towards it. He smashes&nbsp;
the stuff’s box and runs away. His family members,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.240
on the other hand, think Jason is a bad kid and&nbsp;
a freak for refusing such an appealing dessert.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.520
They now only eat, talk, and&nbsp;
think about “the Stuff”.
&nbsp;

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.840
Meanwhile, David, with his great sense&nbsp;
of humor, is able to approach Nicole,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:13.040
the stuff’s advertising campaign designer.&nbsp;
Although working for a huge project like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.640
the Stuff, Nicole has no interest in trying the&nbsp;
white-addictive substance. David plans to inspect&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.960
the factory of the stuff by gaining Nicole’s&nbsp;
trust so that she can support him with it.
&nbsp;

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.960
Elsewhere in a supermarket, seeing people&nbsp;
buying the evil substance, Jason becomes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:34.640
angry. He intentionally destroys all the Stuff&nbsp;
products on the display shelves, shouting at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.760
people that the Stuff is a deadly dessert.&nbsp;
However, nobody cares what the kid warns, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:45.040
security rush in to stop Jason’s vandalizing.
During this time, David observes people are not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:50.080
simply loving the dessert as someone normally&nbsp;
would. Whoever tastes it once, craves it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:56.080
including people’s pets. David realizes the&nbsp;
changes in humans as well as pets’ behaviors,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:01.280
noticing when they are hungry for the Stuff. The&nbsp;
craze for the dessert is far deadlier and much&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.600
more evil than anyone could have believed. 
The following morning, David meets with Charles,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.880
a junk food mogul known as "Chocolate Chip&nbsp;
Charlie". His dessert company went bankrupt after&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.920
the rocketing sales of the Stuff over the past&nbsp;
two months. David convinces Charles to join in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.960
the investigation of the brainwashing dessert.
As the two stop by a grocery store, they notice&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:25.280
the owner turns very suspicious and&nbsp;
refuses to sell things to the men,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.320
seemingly starving for the Stuff. He tries to&nbsp;
send David and Charles away so that he can enjoy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:35.440
his favorite sweet. He is soon killed by the&nbsp;
white substance as it erupts from his mouth.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.240
Before David and Charles can save the man, the&nbsp;
Stuff retreats from the window. A moment later,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:45.680
the two are attacked by several men who appear to&nbsp;
be zombie-like creatures. The Stuff burows into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.880
those who eat it and gradually takes over their&nbsp;
brains, mutating them into zombies. David and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.360
Charles then manage to escape on a boat.
The two visit a restaurant where David, who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:01.520
reveals to be serious, asks Charles to report the&nbsp;
deadly Stuff to Frank Herbert, a Special FBI agent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:07.600
in Washington DC. The FBI fired David for his&nbsp;
recklessness while on duty, so it makes more sense&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:13.040
to have Charles as the reporter. As David leaves,&nbsp;
the waitress, who is also an addict of the stuff,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:18.400
immediately informs other Stuff-heads. The&nbsp;
former agent is nearly killed as a Stuff van&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.400
attempts to hit him on the road. Later,&nbsp;
he comes across an article about Jason,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:27.920
who seems to be the only one in the whole country&nbsp;
who isn’t a fan of the stuff. Vandalizing the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:32.880
products any chance that he gets. He then tells&nbsp;
Nicole, who is now his girlfriend, to help him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:38.640
carry out a plan. He then leaves to see Jason.
At night, Jason is made to eat the Stuff again by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:43.520
his family. The boy pretends to take the cup and&nbsp;
then enters the toilet. He pours out all of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:48.720
cream refilling it with shaving cream. He returns&nbsp;
to tell his family that he loves the stuff, hoping&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.840
to keep himself safe for the time being. However,&nbsp;
his father learns that the stuff was replaced with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:58.960
shaving cream. Jason is chased by his family&nbsp;
members, but luckily, he runs into David,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:04.080
who is on the way looking for the boy. David&nbsp;
rescues Jason and drives off from his parents.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.360
The two meet up with Nicole boarding&nbsp;
the flight headed to the factory.
&nbsp;

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:13.600
Finally arriving in Georgia, Jason is still asleep&nbsp;
on the plane. David tells his pilot to take the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:18.480
boy to Savannah Airport and waits for further&nbsp;
instructions. Nicole and David will investigate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:22.800
the factory over the next three hours.
During this time, Jason wakes up and finds the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:28.000
Stuff has invaded the plane and is now controlling&nbsp;
the pilot. He quickly escapes from the exit door,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.240
not knowing why he was left alone on the&nbsp;
plane. He runs deep into the woods and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:36.880
ends up reaching the Stuff’s mine, where the&nbsp;
factory exploits the substance from the ground.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:42.160
He secretly climbs to a distribution truck and&nbsp;
hides from the workers. Unfortunately, one worker&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:47.680
closes up the cab which traps Jason inside.
Back at the factory, David and Nicole are given&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:52.320
a tour around the factory, and a staff member&nbsp;
tells them that they have a room paid for at a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:57.520
nearby motel. While sleeping, Stuff starts&nbsp;
emerging from David and Nicole's mattress.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.920
First, it tries to suffocate David. While&nbsp;
struggling with the Stuff, Nicole thinks of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:07.200
an idea to burn it, eventually this idea saves&nbsp;
David. As the couple are still frightened,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:12.880
a man who is a Stuff-addict enters and is killed.&nbsp;
Stuff floods the entire motel while the couple&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:18.480
manage to escape using a car just outside.
On the way, David spots some distribution trucks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:24.080
travelling towards the mines. He decides to follow&nbsp;
them. Jason is still trapped in one of the trucks.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:27.440
In the mines, David and Nicole&nbsp;
learn the truth about the Stuff.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:32.640
They don’t process or manufacture it at all . The&nbsp;
Stuff just seeps out from different places in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:38.400
ground. It goes from the centre of Earth directly&nbsp;
to the supermarkets by siphoning it into trucks.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:43.200
David then tells Nicole to wait for him at the&nbsp;
highway then leaves in a Stuff worker’s suit.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:47.760
He’s planning to steal one of the trucks&nbsp;
as evidence concerning the deadly cream.
&nbsp;

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:52.720
Just then, David sneaks into the mines setting&nbsp;
up dynamite. While trying to navigate to target&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:57.440
a truck, David accidentally hears Jason’s&nbsp;
calling for help from inside of a truck.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:02.480
The boy is struggling as the Stuff is spreading in&nbsp;
the tank. David quickly escapes on the truck that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:07.200
Jason is trapped in, and the mine explodes.
Driving to the highway where Nicole is waiting,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:12.560
David is able to save her from a stuff addicted&nbsp;
sicko. He also rescues Jason from the Stuff’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:17.280
attack in the tank. The three then drive off on&nbsp;
the truck heading towards a military base, where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:22.000
they meet with a ​​ retired soldier - Colonel&nbsp;
Malcolm. They are able to convince him about the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.280
mind-affecting drug covered as a dessert. Right&nbsp;
after that, Malcolm leads his troops to storming&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:32.560
another mine, but they find out that all the&nbsp;
sicko workers have committed suicide. The Stuff&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:38.400
begins to attack the group, flooding all of the&nbsp;
mines. Luckily, no one is killed. Malcolm decides&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:43.040
to leave the scene where it is and broadcasts a&nbsp;
civil defense message for Americans to end their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:49.040
addiction to The Stuff. At the radio station, the&nbsp;
group rejoins Charles. However, the man is soon&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:54.880
mutated and eventually killed by the Stuff. He was&nbsp;
somehow poisoned during the trip to Washington DC.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:55.440 --> 00:08:00.320
The aggressive Stuff then attacks Nicole and&nbsp;
Jason in one of the broadcast rooms. David&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:05.520
and Malcolm burn the station entirely, destroying&nbsp;
the Stuff and rescuing the two just in time. 
&nbsp;

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:09.920
Finally, the Colonel makes his warning and&nbsp;
puts an end to the addiction to the stuff.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:14.480
Everywhere throughout the States, people throw&nbsp;
the Stuff into fire, eliminating the alien&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:19.760
substance. Later, David and Jason go to see the&nbsp;
company’s Head who has them taste the products,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:24.480
which apparently they never dare to do. He&nbsp;
asks whether they are consuming the Stuff&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:29.200
or if it is consuming them. At the&nbsp;
end, David, Nicole, Jason and Colonel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:34.240
Malcolm are honored as national heroes.
 
The movie ends with some smugglers selling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:39.840
the Stuff on the black market and we see one of&nbsp;
them eating the substance, testing it out.
