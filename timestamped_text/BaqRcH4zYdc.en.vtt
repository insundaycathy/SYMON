Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:06.740
Today, I'm going to explain a drama, horror,
and mystery film called "The Witch."

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:07.740
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.570
Watch out and take care.

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.809
&nbsp;
In 17th century New England, a Puritan family

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.380
of six is put on trial after the townsfolk
accused the father, William, of speaking ill

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:19.750
of God.

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.850
William disagrees with their beliefs and brands
the community as false Christians.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:33.960
Because of the dispute, William and his wife,
Katherine, their children, Thomasin, Caleb,

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:40.129
Mercy, and Jonas, are banished from the town.

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:44.579
They begin their journey immediately and ride
on a small carriage to look for a new home.

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.329
Thomasin looks back at the village that she's
known all her life.

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.129
&nbsp;
The family quickly finds a new home by the

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.809
woods and shows gratitude to the Lord by praying
on their knees.

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:57.679
They build a farm near the secluded forest
to move on and start anew.

00:00:57.679 --> 00:01:02.619
Katherine bears her fifth child named Samuel,
whom Thomasin takes care of often.

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:07.380
Thomasin is still loyal to her faith as she
prays regularly and repents on her sins.

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.539
On a typical day, Thomasin plays peekaboo
with Samuel to entertain him.

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:15.189
Initially, the baby giggles as his big sister
play with him.

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:19.039
All of a sudden, after she opens her hands,
baby Samuel disappears.

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:23.520
Thomasin’s face fills with fear as she calls
for him and runs into the woods.&nbsp;

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.439
&nbsp;
A woman dressed in a red cloak runs across

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.659
the forest, holding Samuel.

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.439
The stolen baby is now in the hands of a stranger,
whose intentions toward him are sinister.

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:36.560
A wrinkled hand strokes the baby’s body
before pointing a knife at him.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.790
Moments later, with the full moon in sight,
the woman pounds Samuel’s remains and rubs

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.290
the blood all over her body, completing her
ritual.

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:46.640
&nbsp;
Back at home, the abduction of Samuel devastates

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.259
the whole family, especially Katherine.

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.340
She spends most of her time crying and grieving.

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.179
Caleb notices Thomasin having a bad dream
as she twitches while sleeping.

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:57.740
He wakes her up to calm her down.

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.009
A lot of them believe that a wolf is responsible
for taking the baby.

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.710
William explains to Caleb that there is no
hope for them to find Samuel alive because

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.659
several days have passed.

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:10.280
Both of them decide to hunt and enter the
woods.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.129
However, Caleb questions why they should enter
the forest when William says that it is forbidden.

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:19.260
He says that their crops are not that great,
and their harvest cannot last the winter.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.519
At this point, they must catch their food
if they cannot grow it.

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:25.069
They proceed to hunt while the rest of the
family stays at home.&nbsp;

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:27.780
&nbsp;
Thomasin overhears her mother weeping in the

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.160
room while saying a prayer out loud.

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.450
She observes her from the door and can't help
feeling guilty.

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.290
Back in the woods, William lectures his son
about spiritual matters as they go deeper

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.510
into the woods.

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.550
After setting a trap, Caleb questions whether
the unbaptized soul of Samuel could reach

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.150
heaven or not.

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.110
William refuses to talk about him anymore,
but Caleb persists.

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.200
William calmly explains that some things remain
unknown as they are only humans.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.650
He then reveals that he could afford their
hunting equipment after he traded Katherine's

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.360
prized silver cup.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.280
He warns the young boy that he must not speak
a word about it to his siblings.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.180
They spot a rabbit and hurriedly load the
rifle.

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.760
William aims it at the rabbit, but unfortunately,
the recoil from the shot gets him in the eye,

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.540
sending the rabbit away.&nbsp;

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.770
&nbsp;
On the farm, the twins play with a large black

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:14.230
goat that they named Black Phillip.

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.920
They are fond of the goat and even sing songs
to him.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.090
William rushes to the farm after seeing Mercy
and Jonas playing with the Black Phillip.

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.440
He thinks that it is dangerous as its horns
could harm them.

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.150
William struggles to control the goat but
manages to cage the animal.

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.710
Katherine gets into an angry mood and starts
sermonizing everyone.

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:36.900
She is harsher toward Thomasin and orders
her to gather her father’s dirty clothes.

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.799
Katherine also questions William about where
he has been all day; Caleb backs him up and

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:43.739
says that they looked for apples to cheer
Katherine up.

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:47.290
She holds Caleb dearly and says that nothing
is more important to her than their safety.&nbsp;

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.000
&nbsp;
Thomasin cleans her father's clothes by the

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.939
river when Caleb arrives.

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:57.299
He glances at his sister’s body out of curiosity,
signifying that he is about to reach manhood.

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:01.310
She notices her brother’s weird behavior,
but she remains unbothered.

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.110
She embraces her brother in hopes of cheering
him up.

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.079
They hear rustling noises and stand up to
check on them.

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:11.519
Mercy startles them by pretending to be a
witch by impersonating a witch’s voice.

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:15.590
She is a stubborn little girl who continually
refuses to follow Thomasin.

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.380
Mercy tells Thomasin that their mother hates
her and that it is her fault that Samuel is

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:20.380
gone.

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.720
The little girl also adds that she saw the
witch taking the baby away, but Caleb contradicts

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:25.880
the idea.

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.700
Thomasin plays along with the accusation and
starts to scare Mercy.

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:33.420
Thomasin says she is a witch and that she
will get Mercy if she continues to bother

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:34.420
her.

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:38.140
The little girl shrieks in fear, so Caleb
comes to her rescue.&nbsp;

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:39.940
&nbsp;
That night, while the family prays before

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.140
their meal, they break pieces of bread for
them to share.

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:47.111
Katherine questions Thomasin about the disappearance
of the cup; her daughter responds that she

00:04:47.111 --> 00:04:48.640
has not touched it.

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:53.510
Katherine becomes agitated, focuses her anger
on Thomasin, and suspects her to be responsible

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:55.820
for Samuel's disappearance.

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:59.720
William defends her, as he is indeed the one
responsible for the missing cup.

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.390
Thomasin heads outside to bed the sheep down.

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:06.470
She hears eerie noises in the dark of night,
and upon getting closer to the sheep den,

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:08.760
she finds the rabbit that William failed to
hunt earlier.&nbsp;

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.410
&nbsp;
That night, Katherine opens up about the importance

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:13.190
of the silver cup to her.

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:17.330
She explains that it is their only substitute
if their crops continue to die.

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:20.790
She also adds that Thomasin has now begun
her way to womanhood.

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:24.431
Katherine discusses with William that they
should give Thomasin to another family, which

00:05:24.431 --> 00:05:26.000
she overhears.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.250
She breaks into tears while hearing their
mother have a meltdown about the problems

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:31.170
circulating in their family.

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:35.139
In the middle of the night, Caleb sneaks out
of his bed to attend to his horse.

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:38.580
Thomasin finds him and asks the reason behind
being up late.

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:42.350
He says that he will head to the forest, but
Thomasin stops him from leaving unless he

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:43.350
lets her tag along.&nbsp;

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:45.800
&nbsp;
Both of them walk through the forest to check

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.370
the trap they have set and find a dead animal
attached to it.

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:52.670
Fowler, their dog, barks at something in the
woods.

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:55.620
This gets the siblings’ attention and looks
for what it is.

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:59.400
The same rabbit appears again, which takes
their horse into a panic.

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:04.260
Fowler gives a chase to the rabbit aggressively,
and Caleb follows to kill the rabbit for food.

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:08.580
Thomasin is left with the horse, and because
of her lack of experience in riding, she falls

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:10.770
to the ground, which knocks her unconscious.&nbsp;

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:13.630
&nbsp;
The rest of the family grow worried as Thomasin

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:15.790
and Caleb have not returned home.

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:19.920
The sun is about to set, which makes the forest
much more dangerous.

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:23.400
Caleb loses track of his path and desperately
calls her sister.

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:27.070
Without any response, he prays as he walks
to find his way out.

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:31.370
He hears Fowler letting out a yelp from a
distance, so he follows the sound.

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:35.420
Caleb finds their dog dying as his intestines
are open as if a blood-thirsty creature attacked

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:36.420
it.

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:39.480
He runs out of fear that he might end up the
same as his dog.

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:43.570
Meanwhile, Thomasin gains consciousness and
reunites with her father, who is in search

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:44.700
of them.

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:48.940
After asking where her brother is, Thomasin
is in disbelief that he has not made his way

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:49.940
home.

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:54.080
Caleb discovers a small hut from which a beautiful
woman emerges to lure him.

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:58.330
She gives her a gentle kiss on the lips before
her arm becomes aged and wrinkled as she grabs

00:06:58.330 --> 00:06:59.330
Caleb.&nbsp;

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:01.600
&nbsp;
William takes Thomasin home, and Katherine

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.620
angrily scolds her for taking Caleb into the
woods.

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:09.080
He feels terrible for Thomasin, who has suffered
being on the receiving end of Katherine’s

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:10.080
hatred.

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:13.130
Because of it, he reluctantly admits that
he sold the silver cup.

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:17.210
He also asks forgiveness from Thomasin for
being the one to blame for everything.

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:21.420
The knowledge of it devastates Katherine,
so both of them argue in the rain.

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:25.540
The bond between Katherine and Thomasin is
now restored; she becomes more affectionate

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:26.850
toward her daughter.

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:32.810
Later that night, as the storm rages, Thomasin
discovers Caleb outside the home, naked, incoherent,

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:34.400
and mysteriously ill.

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:38.000
She runs to his rescue and calls for help
from their parents.&nbsp;

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.970
Caleb becomes bedridden and is unable to move
of his own will.

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:45.210
They all become worried that evil is overtaking
them, so they perform a ritual that includes

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:48.000
extracting blood from Caleb to offer to God.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.260
To release his anger, William cuts wood in
the middle of the night despite the rain.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:55.410
The following day, the twins converse with
Black Phillip.

00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:59.250
Mercy tells Thomasin that according to the
goat, wickedness fills her.

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:04.090
Mercy and Jonas continue to accuse Thomasin
of being a witch, and they become more stubborn.

00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:08.860
Thomasin attempts to milk the nanny goat,
but it only produces blood instead of milk.

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:12.590
She starts trembling and kicks the bucket
of blood out of fear, which scares the twins

00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:13.590
as much.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:16.040
&nbsp;
Katherine prays over Caleb’s body as William

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:17.510
enters the room.

00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:21.640
She persuades him that it might be witchcraft,
but he dismisses the idea.

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:26.450
He plans on going back to town to find Thomasin
a family and bring Caleb to the doctors.

00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:30.350
Katherine breaks down once again because of
the gravity of their situation.

00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:35.079
While gathering the harvested crops, the family's
girls hear a scream from inside their house.

00:08:35.079 --> 00:08:39.099
They rush inside to check on Caleb, only to
find him chanting some prayer.

00:08:39.099 --> 00:08:41.959
He twitches on the bed and expresses his pain.

00:08:41.959 --> 00:08:44.339
He shouts random words while in pain.

00:08:44.339 --> 00:08:48.720
He becomes unresponsive and vomits a whole
apple with a single bite taken out of it.

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:50.959
Katherine says that her son is bewitched.

00:08:50.959 --> 00:08:55.240
The twins point out that Thomasin is responsible
for the curse as they run to their mother.

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:59.910
Mercy and Jonas talk about evidence that concludes
that Thomasin is a witch, but she denies it

00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:01.019
desperately.

00:09:01.019 --> 00:09:04.939
The twins persuade Katherine, so she keeps
her distance from her daughter.

00:09:04.939 --> 00:09:08.689
To prove that she is not a witch, William
makes Thomasin kneel in front of him to ask

00:09:08.689 --> 00:09:10.069
about her faith.

00:09:10.069 --> 00:09:14.420
They all pray together as a family when suddenly,
the twins claim to forget the proper words

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:17.009
of their prayer and become unresponsive.

00:09:17.009 --> 00:09:22.089
When Thomasin orders them to pray, the twins
fall to the floor and twitch in great pain.

00:09:22.089 --> 00:09:25.959
Caleb gasps for air and starts saying, “she
desires my blood.”

00:09:25.959 --> 00:09:29.069
Mercy and Jonas say the exact phrase as well.

00:09:29.069 --> 00:09:33.220
Caleb speaks as if he accepts that he is about
to meet God, and he starts to pray passionately

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:36.079
before dying with a smile on his face.&nbsp;

00:09:36.079 --> 00:09:37.720
&nbsp;
Katherine tries to retrieve him, but hope

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:38.949
is gone.

00:09:38.949 --> 00:09:42.449
She has lost another child once again and
cries excessively.

00:09:42.449 --> 00:09:46.009
She shouts at Thomasin, which makes her run
outside.

00:09:46.009 --> 00:09:49.540
Confusion fills her mind as she has no idea
what she did wrong.

00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:52.139
William runs after her to provide her solace.

00:09:52.139 --> 00:09:56.500
Moments later, he expresses his suspicions
about her being involved in witchcraft.

00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:59.930
Thomasin feels betrayed and lost because no
one believes her.

00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:03.689
They both continue to argue as Thomasin points
out William's sins.

00:10:03.689 --> 00:10:07.610
She states that perhaps the twins made a demonic
pact with Black Phillip whom they talk to

00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:09.660
all day and make songs about.

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:13.920
She adds that the devil takes the shape of
a he-goat, and Black Phillip is Lucifer.

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:17.980
Because of confusion on who the real culprit
among the family is, William locks his remaining

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:19.670
children in the goat house.

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:23.840
Thomasin denies being a witch, but Mercy and
Jonas do not answer when she asks if they

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:26.309
have spoken with Black Phillip.

00:10:26.309 --> 00:10:27.790
&nbsp;
William and Katherine bury Caleb by their

00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:30.470
house, and she gives him a last embrace.

00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:34.290
Thomasin hears William break down at night
and confess to God that he has been prideful

00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:37.360
and made his family leave their village out
of stubbornness.

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:41.910
As Katherine prepares for bed, she gets a
vision of Caleb sitting on a chair while holding

00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:42.910
Samuel.

00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:46.670
She approaches the ghost of her children and
takes the baby for her to breastfeed.

00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:51.130
Meanwhile, the children awaken to see an older
woman drinking milk from the nanny goat.

00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:54.589
They look at her intently,&nbsp; but she turns
to attack the twins.

00:10:54.589 --> 00:10:57.700
The three of them let out a loud shriek upon
the event.

00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:02.089
Katherine continues to feed Samuel back in
the house, but in reality, a crow is pecking

00:11:02.089 --> 00:11:05.320
on her chest as she hallucinates seeing her
dead children.

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:07.910
She wakes up the following day with bloodstains
on her dress.&nbsp;

00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:10.800
&nbsp;
As William awakens, he finds the whole farm

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:12.010
in ruins.

00:11:12.010 --> 00:11:15.730
The goats have been slaughtered, and the twins
seem to have vanished.

00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:19.470
William looks at Thomasin with confusion as
she is the only one surviving.

00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:24.009
Out of nowhere, Black Phillip attacks him
by charging its horns on his torso.

00:11:24.009 --> 00:11:28.550
William grabs an ax; he seems ready to fight,
but he then drops it, allowing Black Phillip

00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:32.749
to charge at him once again and knock him
into a pile of logs that crushes him.

00:11:32.749 --> 00:11:35.459
Thomasin’s father is killed before her eyes.

00:11:35.459 --> 00:11:39.610
She slowly approaches William to take one
last look at his lifeless body.

00:11:39.610 --> 00:11:42.589
Katherine grabs her by the hair and calls
her the devil.

00:11:42.589 --> 00:11:46.430
Katherine is completely unhinged and blames
Thomasin for everything the tragedies that

00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:48.200
happened to their family.

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:51.589
Katherine accuses her of trying seduction
on William and Caleb.

00:11:51.589 --> 00:11:54.569
She brings Thomasin to the ground and beats
her recklessly.

00:11:54.569 --> 00:11:57.850
In self-defense, Thomasin grabs a hook to
fight back.

00:11:57.850 --> 00:12:02.209
This causes a wound on Katherine’s forehead,
so she strangles Thomasin, trying harder to

00:12:02.209 --> 00:12:03.560
get rid of her.

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:09.040
Out of desperation, she uses the hook to attack
Katherine once again, which kills her instantly.

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:12.459
She embraces her mother despite every pain
that she has caused.

00:12:12.459 --> 00:12:16.440
She realizes that she is all alone, with no
family or friends left.

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:19.889
Thomasin gathers the courage to stand up and
enter the house.

00:12:19.889 --> 00:12:23.870
She removes her clothes that are full of bloodstains
and takes a moment to let everything sink

00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:24.870
in.

00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:29.449
Thomasin hears chiming sounds, so she follows
them, which leads her to the stable.

00:12:29.449 --> 00:12:33.689
She conjures Black Phillip to speak to her,
to which it asks what she desires.

00:12:33.689 --> 00:12:37.220
It continues to ask her if she would want
to “live deliciously.”

00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:41.089
Black Phillip turns into a tall man and commands
Thomasin to remove her clothes and put her

00:12:41.089 --> 00:12:43.089
name in a book that appears before her.

00:12:43.089 --> 00:12:47.029
Thomasin and Black Phillip make their way
to the woods, where chanting noises lead her

00:12:47.029 --> 00:12:48.649
to a group of witches.

00:12:48.649 --> 00:12:50.709
They gather around a fire and begin to levitate.

00:12:50.709 --> 00:12:56.629
A happy and laughing Thomasin joins them in
their ritual, ascending above the woods.

00:12:56.629 --> 00:13:08.239
Finally, Thomasin feels a sense of belonging.
