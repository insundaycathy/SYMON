00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.060
Hi, Mystery Recapped here.

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:10.180
Today I’m going to explain a British zombie
horror film called “The Rezort,” Spoilers

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:11.400
ahead!

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.499
Watch out and take care!

00:00:17.499 --> 00:00:23.089
Ten years ago, the cromosyn virus outbreak
caused the deadliest pandemic mankind has

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:24.349
ever seen.

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:29.550
The virus killed people and then brought them
back to life, turning them into flesh-hungry

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:30.550
zombies.

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.770
The zombies started infecting everyone around
them, causing a war between the living and

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:35.840
the dead.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.640
The war only ended when a process of bombing
the zombie-infested area called the brimstone

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.289
protocol was brought into action.

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:47.190
By the end of it, more than two billion people
had died.

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.620
Zombies were wiped out from the face of the
earth, except for in the Rezort.

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.960
The rezort is a sun-drenched island that monetizes
the existence of the zombies.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.339
People from around the world pay thousands
of dollars to go to the island and hunt zombies

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:02.399
safely.

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.180
The rezort’s CEO is a woman named Valerie
Wilton.

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.420
She is praised for her wonderful tactic to
bring the world’s economy back on track

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:11.680
after the war.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:17.500
Moreover, she is also funding a charitable
organization called Hope4U which aids international

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:18.500
refugees.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.920
A young couple named Lewis and Melanie has
come to the island for a similar venture.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.299
Melanie’s father was turned into a zombie
during the war, which has left a deep scar

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:28.350
in her life.

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.570
Hence, she is on the island to cope with her
trauma.

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.340
The couple, along with other guests are brought
into an exclusive lobby to rest after their

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:37.340
flight.

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.470
Among the guests are two teenage gamers named
Jack and Alfie, a girl named Sadie who was

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.549
supposed to come with her fiance, and a quiet
veteran named Archer.

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:49.160
They are finally taken to the famous resort.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.850
At night, the guests enjoy food and drinks
while Valerie Wilton gives a speech about

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.350
the resort being everyone’s fantasies come
true.

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.180
The place is a paradise for people who want
to heal from the trauma that the war had caused

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:02.180
them.

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.350
Sadie leaves the party and wanders around
looking for something.

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.970
She nervously enters the facility’s control
room and hacks into the resort’s mainframe

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.690
to extract some data.

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.510
Archer notices her walking out of the room,
but doesn’t think much of it.

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.030
The following day, the group is put into a
vehicle by their tour guide Tom.

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.690
They finally set off for the zombie hunting
adventure.

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.470
When the officials try to close the main gate
after the vehicles leave, the system starts

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:27.920
to malfunction.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.590
The technicians dismiss it as a minor issue.

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.569
The group is then taken to a hunting spot,
where Tom briefs them on the techniques and

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:36.040
rules of the hunt.

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.230
Melanie looks over to the field and sees hundreds
of zombies roaming around.

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.970
She is still not ready to hunt them because
they remind her of her dad.

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.120
On the other hand, Jack and Alfie start shooting
almost immediately.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.730
Lewis makes the first kill and hands the rifle
to Melanie.

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.150
She points it at a female zombie but cannot
shoot when she gets a look at her face.

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.970
Meanwhile, Archer from behind them shoots
like a professional and kills every shot he

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.320
makes.

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.239
Everyone is impressed by his skills.

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:07.690
Then, the group is brought to a camping site,
where they are going to stay for the night.

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.639
Back in the resort, the security problem hasn’t
been fixed.

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:14.580
A worried Valerie asks the head of security
to run a full diagnosis.

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.580
They soon figure out that someone unauthorized
had gotten into their system and left them

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.379
with a virus that is causing security breaches.

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:26.659
If the computer virus is not contained, soon
the resort will be flooded with zombies.

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:29.860
Somewhere else, another group who had left
for the hunt is attacked.

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.220
The zombies get one person while the others
manage to escape.

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.410
Right after, the resort is attacked too.

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:39.519
The guests run in fear as the zombies begin
to bite everyone in their way.

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:44.129
Soon, they get into the control room and begin
to turn the employees into one of them.

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:48.580
Valerie hides behind the computers, watching
as the creatures kill everyone.

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.000
Before they can get to her, she runs into
her office and locks herself in.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.920
A staff member begs her to open the door for
him but she doesn’t.

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.409
The system automatically activates the brimstone
protocol, which will destroy the island in

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:01.860
a few hours.

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.610
Back in the camp, Melanie approaches Sadie
and talks about why she is there.

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:09.069
As the two talk, they see a zombie walking
towards them.

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:11.730
Sadie takes a gun and points at the creature.

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.770
However, she cannot shoot him out of sympathy.

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:17.130
The zombie is killed by Archer.

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.921
Tom starts to freak out because the zombies
are not supposed to come to the camp, as they

00:04:20.921 --> 00:04:23.730
are separated by a tall electric fence.

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:27.880
He uses the car’s light to look around and
sees a group of zombies approaching them.

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.540
The security breach had caused the fences
to open, allowing the zombies to enter the

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:32.920
safe zone.

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:36.960
Archer starts shooting them as Tom gets inside
the car to contact the resort.

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.320
He is not able to get to them and even the
vehicle doesn’t start.

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:45.140
Sadie and Melanie are hiding inside the tent
where Melanie is attacked by a zombie.

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:48.100
Sadie saves her and the two run towards the
car.

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.270
Everyone gets on top of it to save themselves.

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.520
However, when Alfie tries to climb up, he
is bit by a zombie.

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.240
Jack watches as his best friend lies limp
on the ground.

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.340
Suddenly, everything goes quiet.

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.560
The camp is covered with dead zombies.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.600
The group decides to stay on top of the car
for the night.

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.890
The next morning, Tom tells them that they
aren’t getting any help, and only a few

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:11.520
hours are left till the brimstone protocol.

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:16.780
Once it starts, several explosions will automatically
take place on the island killing all the zombies

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:18.790
to stop further infection.

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:22.090
They have to get away from the island before
the protocol starts.

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:25.340
The staff were told to be at the dock before
the resort was taken over.

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:29.630
But since their car isn’t working, reaching
the dock in time is impossible.

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:34.080
Tom takes a look at the island map and figures
out that the communication relay has an underground

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.840
way back to the dock.

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:39.130
The group makes their way to the communication
relay led by Archer.

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:42.050
He stops the group every few minutes sensing
danger.

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.130
Lewis retaliates saying that no one made him
the leader.

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:48.610
Suddenly, a zombie attacks Jack but is killed
by Tom.

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:51.500
Tom notices that the zombie is a fellow travel
guide.

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:55.900
They continue the journey and reach a broken
fence with a car crashed onto it.

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:59.880
They get to the other side one by one but
are attacked by the zombies midway.

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:02.930
One of them bites a chunk of flesh off Tom.

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:06.810
Everyone watches him in shock when suddenly,
Lewis shoots him dead.

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:10.170
Melanie is horrified that her boyfriend would
do something like that.

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:13.370
Without dwelling about it, they continue towards
the communication relay.

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:17.250
When they finally reach the place, Archer
asks Sadie to be in check or else they will

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:18.760
leave her behind.

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:23.430
When the others call him out for being disrespectful,
he reveals that he had seen Sadie sneaking

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:27.440
around the control room while hiding from
the security the other day.

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.420
Everyone asks Sadie if that is true.

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:33.130
She finally reveals that she is a member of
an undead rights activist group called the

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:34.730
Living 2.

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:37.860
She and her group wanted to stop the brutal
hunting going on the island.

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:42.080
So, she was sent to download some secret data
from the resort’s mainframe.

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:45.950
However, she had been betrayed by her own
people because when she was downloading the

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:49.940
data, they uploaded a virus to crash the whole
security system.

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:53.470
Lewis harshly blames Sadie for killing all
those people.

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:56.880
Everyone looks at Sadie in disapproval and
makes their way towards the communication

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:58.990
relay leaving her behind.

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:02.860
Melanie is disappointed but asks Sadie to
come with them anyway.

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:06.380
They go inside the building to see half-eaten
bodies scattered everywhere.

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:10.530
The building is infested with zombies but
the group make their way inside carefully,

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:11.870
without making noise.

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:15.400
They separate into two groups while trying
to hide from the zombies.

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:19.280
Sadie and Jack go one way and Archer, Melanie,
and Lewis go the other.

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:22.850
The second group reaches the opening to the
underground way they were looking for but

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:25.670
Jack and Sadie are attacked by the creatures.

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:28.190
Sadie gets bitten in the encounter.

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:32.660
With no way out, she asks Jack to run away
as a hoard of zombies takes over her.

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:36.760
Jack runs to the rest of the group and they
quickly get on the other side of a fence and

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:37.760
save themselves.

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:41.790
They then make their way underground and reach
a dark hall.

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:45.910
Going further in, they see several zombies
in cages being held in a room at a very high

00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:46.910
temperature.

00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:51.070
They escape the oven-like room and think that
they are safe but just then, a zombie latches

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:53.230
onto Jack and bites him.

00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:56.290
Archer kills the zombie but now Jack is infected.

00:07:56.290 --> 00:07:59.740
When he starts to convert, Archer unwillingly
shoots him.

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:05.110
Now, only three of them remain alive; Archer,
Melanie, and Lewis.

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:09.240
The three move forward and are confused to
see a refugee camp organised by a charitable

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:11.770
foundation called hope4U.

00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:16.060
They soon realize that CEO Valerie had been
bringing in refugees from around the world

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:18.010
promising to provide them with shelter.

00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:23.780
But instead, they converted innocent refugees
into zombies to keep the island running.

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:27.490
The incubation room they came across earlier
was to heat the zombies so they would look

00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:30.990
older and the tourists wouldn’t know that
they are fresh.

00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:33.930
Suddenly, the fresh refugee zombies come out
of the tent.

00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:37.780
The three run back into the hallway but cannot
hold the door closed against the crowd of

00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:39.070
zombies.

00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:42.880
While Melanie and Archer struggle to hold
the door, Lewis runs away selfishly to save

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:44.080
his life.

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:48.010
Archer offers to hold the door until Melanie
runs away as well.

00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:51.460
She agrees once he makes her believe that
he will be right behind her.

00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:55.820
However, after Melanie is on the other side,
Archer opens the door and runs through the

00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:56.840
crowd of zombies.

00:08:56.840 --> 00:09:02.280
Now, only sixteen minutes are left for the
brimstone protocol to be executed.

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:06.020
Melanie walks through a hallway and reaches
the lobby they were brought to when they first

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:07.380
arrived at the island.

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:09.400
The place is also covered with zombies.

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:14.100
Suddenly, Lewis appears in front of her and
apologizes for leaving earlier.

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:18.650
Melanie notices a bite mark on his arm and
points her gun at him.

00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:21.260
Instead of shooting, she hands him the gun.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:26.390
Lewis knows he cannot be saved, so he shoots
himself dead, while Melanie is chased by the

00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:27.390
zombies.

00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:31.530
She is suddenly dragged into a room by CEO
Valerie who claims that they can only run

00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:33.670
out through the emergency exit.

00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:37.110
Melanie refuses to cooperate with her and
calls her a monster.

00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:40.740
The two struggle for the gun but are soon
attacked by the creatures.

00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:45.180
They kill Valerie but Melanie manages to run
outside while being chased.

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:50.450
Just then the brimstone protocol starts causing
several explosions all around the island.

00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:54.740
Melanie narrowly avoids being caught in the
explosion by jumping into the sea.

00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:59.340
The whole island burns in flames as rescue
helicopters fly around it.

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:03.020
Three weeks after the incident, we see Archer
sitting in a bar.

00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:08.380
He had miraculously managed to escape from
the island and is watching Melanie on television.

00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:13.560
She talks about how mankind won against the
zombie but lost their humanity in the war.

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:18.540
She has exposed the hope4U organization and
warns the people that a second war might be

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:19.540
