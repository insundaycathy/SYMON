00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.950
In 1928, on mountains covered with snow, a
climber is on his expedition to the peak.

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.910
He encounters a glowing sphere of ice on the
way and tries to break it with his pickaxe,

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:13.330
only to be overwhelmed by an intense blinding
light.

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.100
Just then, he finds himself waking up from
a short blackout.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.930
Strangely enough, the sphere is gone and there
is a scar on his hand.

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:22.330
What was that sphere?

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.500
Why is his hand left injured?

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.890
This is Movie Shortens.

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.490
Follow us today to the movie titled: The Day
the Earth Stood Still.

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.550
Be aware: there are spoilers!

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.720
Time travel to modern-day America, Dr. Helen,
an astrobiologist, returns home after work

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.460
with her stepson Jacob.

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.240
She receives a strange phone call from a man
announcing that she’ll be picked up in a

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.260
couple of minutes.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.780
While Helen is still confused, the US government
shows up and drags her out of the house under

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.480
Federal protection.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.430
She has a neighbor take care of Jacob and
leaves with the men immediately.

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.890
Helen arrives at a military base and joins
other scientists, who also have no idea about

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:01.570
this government mobilization.

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:02.870
The group is brought to Ft.

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.489
Linwood Military Academy, New Jersey.

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.580
Entering the base, they are required to submit
all cell phones and cameras.

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.470
Helen manages to hide her phone before that.

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.030
Just then she meets with her friend Michael
and has him explain this whole story in a

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.190
conference room.

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.900
An object is detected beyond Jupiter's orbit
and is moving at 30,000 kilometers per second.

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:27.729
It is forecasted to impact Manhattan, eventually
would destroy all life on Earth in 78 minutes.

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:31.930
Later, Helen secretly makes a phone call to
Jacob and tells the boy to hide in the shelter

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:33.830
tonight no matter what happens.

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:38.180
Next, she is put on a helicopter along with
a group of other scientists to formulate a

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:39.380
survival plan.

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.780
However, at the time of the impact, all is
quiet.

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.052
There is a huge sphere landing from the sky,
followed by dense fog at the time the helicopter

00:01:47.052 --> 00:01:49.050
releases all the scientists.

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.320
Helen slowly approaches the sphere in the
bright light and sees a figure also comes

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.320
to her.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.490
As Helen is about to shake hands with that
being, government snipers shoot it for Helen’s

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:59.490
safety.

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.290
Helen holds the figure and calls for a medic.

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.460
Just then, a giant robot emerges, creating
a sound that irritates all humans and disrupts

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.119
all electrical systems around.

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.959
Before the robot can take the being back,
it is ordered to shut down by the being.

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.459
The being is rapidly taken to the operating
room to remove the bullet.

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:20.110
The doctor breaks the cover around it and
finds whale blubber texture and it begins

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:21.730
to fall off on its own.

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.590
The being turns into a human baby as if it
was born here on earth.

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.200
The being is immediately put into an incubator
while it "grows".

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.680
Shortly after that, a full-grown "human" develops
inside the incubator.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.569
He’s awake and encounters convulsion in
the incubator.

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:38.120
The first person there to speak to him is
Helen.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.499
The United States Secretary of Defense, Regina
meets with Helen and the team about the being.

00:02:43.499 --> 00:02:47.109
It reveals that the aliens landed for the
first time on earth in 1928.

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:52.499
The patch of skin removed from the mountaineer's
hand was a DNA sample so the being could replicate

00:02:52.499 --> 00:02:54.569
itself into human form.

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:59.930
He introduces himself as Klaatu, a representative
of a group of alien races sent to talk to

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:01.269
the world leaders.

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:05.379
Regina tells him that she is the nearest he
is going to get to their president and to

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:07.189
just tell her what he wants.

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:12.129
He refuses so she orders Klaatu to be drugged
and interrogated instead of being sent to

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:13.639
a secure location.

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:17.459
Michael objects to her idea but Helen volunteers
to drug him.

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:21.430
However, Helen injects Klaatu with water,
attempting to free him.

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:26.650
In the lie detector test, Klaatu takes mind
control of the government officer and learns

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.099
an escape map from him.

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:32.639
He then creates the high-pitch sounds and
jams the electrical system, finally getting

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:34.500
out of the center.

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.829
Klaatu makes it to a railway station, only
to find himself bleeding again from the bullet

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:39.829
wound.

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:41.829
He then makes a phone call to Helen for help.

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:46.319
He is then taken away in Helen's car with
Jacob in the back seat, stating that he is

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:47.769
a friend to the Earth.

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:52.549
In the car, Klaatu requires Helen to give
him a jar inside her own pocket, which Helen

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:54.400
never knew was there before.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.959
He rubs the paste on his wound and sees it
heals immediately.

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:00.529
She drives in the rain under the man’s direction.

00:04:00.529 --> 00:04:04.159
Meanwhile, the arrival of the sphere has caused
a worldwide panic.

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:08.749
The United States military manages to destroy
the robot from the beginning whose name is

00:04:08.749 --> 00:04:09.749
"GORT".

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:14.159
However, their efforts are discouraged by
the robot when most of the drones attacks

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:15.489
are taken down.

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:18.230
They capture the robot instead to learn about
it further.

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:22.280
Elsewhere on the highway, Jacob asks Klaatu
what should mankind deal with the aliens at

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.290
the moment, should they run, fight or stay?

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:29.840
Klaatu simply answers none of them and requires
Helen to pull over a McDonald’s.

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.970
There he meets with an Asian man named Mr.
Wu.

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:37.570
It’s revealed that he is another alien who
had been assigned by the same group of alien

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:41.220
civilizations to live with the humans for
70 years.

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:46.310
Wu tells Klaatu that he has found the human
race to be destructive and unwilling to change,

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:48.880
which matches Klaatu's experiences.

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:53.220
Their purpose of coming here is to save the
Earth from destruction by humankind.

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:58.430
After the meeting, Klaatu comes to a forest
and orders a smaller sphere hidden in a pond.

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:02.280
It turns out there are lots of similar spheres
appearing around the world to begin taking

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:08.650
animal species off the planet before Klaatu
represents the alien civilizations to destroy

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:09.650
humankind.

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:14.280
During this time, Jacob confronts Helen about
the man’s presence and the reason Helen

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.480
has to drive him with them.

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:18.390
Helen just tells him it is complicated.

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:22.310
Disappointed at Helen, Jacob rushes out to
go home by himself.

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:27.630
The two then see a sphere flying up the sky,
which is seen at other places all around the

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:29.050
Earth at the same time.

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:34.310
Klaatu comes back from the woods and explains
to Helen, saying this planet is dying.

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:38.450
Helen tries to convince Klaatu that the world
is not bad and that humans can change the

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:39.960
earth for the better.

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.860
While they are talking, a cop spots Klaatu
and reports to the government.

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:49.200
Can’t convince the cop, Klaatu accidentally
kills him by controlling the car hitting the

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:50.200
man.

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.340
Jacob accuses Klaatu of murderer.

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:56.110
Just then, Klaatu revives the cop with his
superpower.

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:00.420
She then takes him to the home of Barnhardt,
a Nobel prize-winning Professor.

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:05.540
The prof talks about how Klaatu's race went
through drastic, collaborative evolution to

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:08.170
prevent the demise of their planets.

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:12.740
Barnhardt believes that Earth is at the same
precipice, and humanity should be given a

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:16.460
chance to understand that it too must change.

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:21.280
When the trio is talking, Jacob sees Klaatu
on TV news and decides to report him to the

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:22.280
police.

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:26.300
Seeing the helicopters approaching, the trio
runs to the woods to escape.

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:28.640
Helen is caught immediately by the military.

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:33.560
Jacob is left behind, seeing Klaatu destroy
two helicopters with his mind-controlling

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:34.560
ability.

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:38.090
Scared, Jacob runs away and slips on the bridge.

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:40.630
Fortunately, Klaatu makes it to save the boy.

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:44.400
Meanwhile, in the examination tower, GORT
is burnt down.

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:50.020
However, the robot seems to be unharmed and
transforms into a swarm of winged, insect-like,

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:55.980
nano-machines that self-replicate as they
consume every man-made object in their path.

00:06:55.980 --> 00:07:00.000
They quickly spread all around and turn everything
into dust.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.470
At the same time, Helen convinces Regina that
she can stop Klaatu’s plan.

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:10.080
Back to Jacob and Klaatu, the boy soon realizes
Klaatu isn’t a bad guy.

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:12.870
They arrive at a cemetery where Jacob’s
father is buried.

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:17.560
Jacob tries to persuade Klaatu to save the
Earth, just like his father used to sacrifice

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:19.580
himself in the war for peace.

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:22.150
However, Klaatu doesn’t change his mind.

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:24.640
At this moment, Helen and Michael arrive.

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:28.889
Helen tells Jacob how much she missed his
father and they share a good cry.

00:07:28.889 --> 00:07:31.880
The scene between the mother and son convinces
Klaatu.

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:35.010
He has a second thought and decides to save
humanity.

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:39.470
He tells Helen that he is not sure how to
stop the alien insects but he will try.

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:44.280
The group quickly returns to the sphere, where
Klaatu believes he can stop the insects from

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:45.280
there.

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:48.910
During this time, Regina attempts to convince
the president to wait for Helen.

00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:53.300
However, the government decides to carry their
own plan to destroy GORT.

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:58.260
On the way, Helen notices something is odd
when the entire town has been evacuated.

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:02.940
As they turn to a roadblock, they are strangely
not chased by the military vehicles just like

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:04.280
a minute before.

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:08.430
When they approach the sphere, a bomb strikes
at the sphere, which is authorized by the

00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:09.430
government.

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:13.080
This causes the car to flip over and Michael
dies right away.

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:17.490
The remaining tries to run away from the insect
clouds and hide in a tunnel.

00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:21.690
Jacob and Helen begin to bleed out from their
noses, revealing the penetration from the

00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:23.120
nano insects.

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:25.520
Helen pleads with Klaatu to save Jacob.

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:30.130
Just then, Klaatu decides to transfer all
the infection into his own body.

00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:34.890
He then walks straight to the storms of insects
and tries to reach the sphere, sacrificing

00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:36.729
himself to stop GORT.

00:08:36.729 --> 00:08:41.579
A moment later, the nano insects are brought
down, making the technology devices becoming

00:08:41.579 --> 00:08:43.519
useless and immobile.

00:08:43.519 --> 00:08:45.829
There is a mass blackout around the world.

00:08:45.829 --> 00:08:48.089
Humankind is finally saved.

00:08:48.089 --> 00:08:53.899
Jacob and Helen come to the sphere and understand
that Klaatu didn’t die, he is just leaving!
