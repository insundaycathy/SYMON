desert wasteland where petrol and&nbsp;
water are precious commodities.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.360
It follows Max Rockatansky, who teams up&nbsp;
with Imperator Furiosa to run from cult&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:32.160

Furiosa, is dispatched in her armoured 'War&nbsp;&nbsp;

realises that his five wives are leaving with her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

he leads his army after Furiosa, enlisting the&nbsp;
help of neighbouring Gas Town and the Bullet Farm.

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:13.040
With Max attached to his automobile, Nux joins&nbsp;
the chase, and a confrontation between the War&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:18.560

himself in order to destroy the Rig. Max manages&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.920

Furiosa and the women with him. Nux boards the&nbsp;
Rig as it departs and attempts to murder Furiosa,&nbsp;&nbsp;

biker gang, having negotiated a bargain&nbsp;&nbsp;

for safe passage. When the gang discovers&nbsp;
Joe's army approaching, they turn on her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.000
forcing her and the group to leave, while the&nbsp;
bikers destroy the canyon walls to stop Joe.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.840
As Joe's vehicle breaks past the roadblock, Max&nbsp;
and Furiosa fend off the pursuing motorcyclists.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:15.040
Joe catches up with the War Rig, allowing Nux to&nbsp;
board with the intention of assaulting Furiosa&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:21.280
again; however, he fails, to to Joe's dismay. As&nbsp;
the Rig flees, Angharad slips off while attempting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.640
to assist Max and is tragically struck by Joe's&nbsp;
automobile. Furiosa informs Max that they are&nbsp;&nbsp;

Max departs to confront Furiosa&nbsp;
and his soldiers after Furiosa&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.840

firearms and ammo. During the battle,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.320

rescue of the imprisoned Rig and joins the crew.

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.000
After driving the War Rig through&nbsp;
swampland and desert for the night,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.800
the team stumbles upon a fascinating woman.&nbsp;
Furiosa approaches her and tells her about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.440
her family history and clan allegiance.&nbsp;
The lady gathers her clan, the Vuvalini,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.400
who identify Furiosa as a child who was&nbsp;
abducted. Furiosa is saddened to discover&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.360
that the swampland they went through was, in&nbsp;
fact, the Green Place, which is now inhospitable.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.120
The gang then intends to bike over vast&nbsp;
salt plains in search of a new home.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Max persuades them to return to the undefended&nbsp;
Citadel, which has plenty of water and vegetation,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.920
and to trap Joe and his army in the bikers' canyon&nbsp;
after having visions of a kid he failed to save.

The gang returns to the Citadel and engages&nbsp;
Joe's soldiers, killing several Vuvalini and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:42.080
many of Joe's forces and badly injuring Furiosa.&nbsp;
Joe parks his automobile in front of the War Rig&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.880
in order to slow it down, as Max battles&nbsp;
Joe's gigantic adult son, Rictus Erectus.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.440
Joe kidnaps Toast, who distracts him&nbsp;
long enough for Furiosa to murder him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.960
Nux makes the ultimate sacrifice by damaging&nbsp;
the Rig, killing Rictus, and closing the canyon,&nbsp;&nbsp;
