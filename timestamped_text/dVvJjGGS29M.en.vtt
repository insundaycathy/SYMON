have landed on earth and started an invasion&nbsp;
in europe with millions of human casualties&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:24.160
the mimic seemed unstoppable until humanity gained&nbsp;
the upper hand at verdun the victory is attributed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.880
to the use of a new robotic armored exoskeleton&nbsp;
that ensures even soldiers with minimal training&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.920
can be turned into super soldiers citing vita&nbsp;
vertovsky's 100 kills in her first day of battle&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.640
dubbed as the angel of verdun dita's&nbsp;
success made her the face of the army&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.200
vida's brash stoic and blunt nature&nbsp;
paired with her mimic kill count&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.240

main man in recruitment for the war effort he&nbsp;
meets with general brigham in london to discuss&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:07.360
operation downfall's impact on the population's&nbsp;
perception of the war effort brigham is concerned&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.840
that once the battle is won a lot of soldiers&nbsp;
will die and many will be eyeing him for the blame&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:17.280
bill suggests a way to depict brigham's story&nbsp;
is the man who saved humanity from the mimics&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.400
brigham clarifies that he doesn't want himself to&nbsp;
be highlighted but the invasion itself and orders&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.720
bill to the front lines with a camera crew&nbsp;
surprised by his sudden involvement in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.840
war bill tries to reason out with the general&nbsp;
that his only military experiences with rotc&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.720
in college and that he only joined the military&nbsp;
when his advertising firm shut down only serving&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.000
as head of the military's media relations brigham&nbsp;
clarifies that this is an order not a suggestion&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.800
desperate to stay bill threatens brigham that&nbsp;
he can easily shift the blame of the war to him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:52.240
general brigham is unimpressed and has him&nbsp;
arrested the next morning bill wakes up in a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.880
recruitment camp he meets sergeant farrell who&nbsp;
informs him that he's been branded a deserter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.360
and is charged with impersonating an officer&nbsp;
bill has now been demoted to private and is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.160
brought to j squad the whole base prepares&nbsp;
for the invasion and bill gets strapped into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:11.680
one of the armor exoskeletons the invasion force&nbsp;
loaded up into aircrafts and they head to france&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.480
before they could land bill's aircraft gets&nbsp;
hit by a missile and everyone is forced to bail&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:22.160
bill miraculously survives the crash and advances&nbsp;
to the beach all around him planes crash bombs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.840
explode and soldiers die vita joins the battle and&nbsp;
bill sees her fighting the mimics with broadsword&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.280
killing them with relative ease vita and bill&nbsp;
lock eyes before vita get shot by a mimic killing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.480
her bill regroups with farrell and the remains&nbsp;
of j-squad and prepares for the mimics charge&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.120
they get ambushed and everyone dies bill&nbsp;
survives and kills the ambushing mimic but an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:48.560
alpha mimic comes up behind him vil grabs a mine&nbsp;
and kills the alpha but gets covered in its blood&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.880
melting his skin and killing him bill&nbsp;
wakes up at the recruitment camp again&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.800
dazed and reeling from confusion he is unsure of&nbsp;
what happened he meets farrell and is introduced&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.840
to j squad again bill is extremely confused as&nbsp;
everything is happening just as it did earlier&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.640
he gets loaded up into the armor then the&nbsp;
aircraft and they launch for the invasion&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.160
they fly and get hit by a missile again and bill&nbsp;
finds himself on the beach he stumbles his way&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.840
across the battlefield before getting killed&nbsp;
and waking up in the recruitment camp again&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.880
bill tries to tell farrell and jay squad&nbsp;
what's happening but nobody believes him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.440
he still ends up in the transport aircraft&nbsp;
flying into france bill dies several more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.560
times but respawns every time he dies bill gets&nbsp;
better at killing the mimics and vita notices&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.280
she tells bill to find her when he wakes&nbsp;
up before she could continue they both die&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.880
bill wakes up and finds veda telling her what&nbsp;
happened it turns out that she had the power&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.200
before him and this only happens if they kill&nbsp;
an alpha mimic and get covered in its blood&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.080
the pair meet up with carter an expert&nbsp;
in particle physics advanced microbiology&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:56.800
he explains to bill that the mimics are less of&nbsp;
an army and more like a singular organism the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.840
alpha mimic that bill killed serves as the alien&nbsp;
central nervous system the brain of the mimics is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:07.360
the omega and it controls them all the omega has&nbsp;
the ability to control time and reset day to start&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:13.120
the battle anew this is the reason why the aliens&nbsp;
have been so successful vita then tells bill that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:18.400
the win at verdun was a fake out fooling humanity&nbsp;
into believing there's a chance to win the mimics&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.960
will then use its power to wipe out the majority&nbsp;
of humanity's army and continue with a planet-wide&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.840
invasion carter then warns bill of strange visions&nbsp;
of the future and visions of the omega itself&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:34.160
this happens he theorizes when the omega gets&nbsp;
close to locating bill vita then trains bill to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.960
fight in the training field veto warns bill that&nbsp;
if he gets injured he should make sure he dies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:45.280
if he loses a lot of blood and gets a transfusion&nbsp;
he might lose the power to reset time bill trains&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:50.960
with vita and dies again and again and again until&nbsp;
he finally gets a vision of the omega's location&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:56.000
with his first vision appearing the pair finish&nbsp;
with training and move into battle bill and vita&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.480
try their best to survive the invasion with bill&nbsp;
trying to memorize everything that's happening and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:04.880
orienting vita every time they meet again the&nbsp;
pair try their best to cross the beach but the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:10.000
repeats slowly take a toll on bill as he has to&nbsp;
watch vita get killed a countless number of times&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.760
bill finds himself caring more and more&nbsp;
for vita each time he relives the day&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:18.640
carter finally finds the omega in germany but&nbsp;
a frustrated bill tells him that no matter what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:23.920
they do they still can't manage to survive the&nbsp;
initial beach landing after several more tries&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:28.800
the pair managed to make it across the beach onto&nbsp;
a trailer park they find a vehicle and drive as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:34.080
far as they can inland bill tells vita that they&nbsp;
eventually talk and get to know each other better&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:38.320
vida is apprehensive but bill tells her some&nbsp;
details about her life that she shared with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:42.960
him but vita shrugs they stumble into an&nbsp;
old farmhouse and find a small helicopter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:48.400
vita wants to fly to germany but bill argues they&nbsp;
should stay for the night he makes them coffee&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:53.200
but vita notices that bill already knows how she&nbsp;
likes her coffee bill admits that they've lived&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:57.120
this before but he doesn't want to go further&nbsp;
because he cares for her and she always dies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:01.840
before they could take off in the helicopter he&nbsp;
can't bring himself to kill the omega as it would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:07.200
make vida's death permanent determined to finish&nbsp;
the war vita starts the helicopter and the mimics&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:12.800
attack and just as bill had said she dies bill&nbsp;
responds in the camp again but this time decides&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:18.640
to journey alone to the omega he manages to fly&nbsp;
to germany only to find that the omega isn't there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:22.800
he gets ambushed by an alpha but notices&nbsp;
the alpha isn't trying to kill him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:28.320
bill recognizes that it's trying to retrieve its&nbsp;
powers he drowns himself and respawns in the camp&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:34.000
telling vida and carter about what he saw with no&nbsp;
other options the trio decide to try out carter's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.440
prototype transponder which would allow&nbsp;
them to see the omega's true location&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.040
they first have to retrieve it from&nbsp;
general brigham at the headquarters&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:46.720
vita and bill meet with brigham at headquarters&nbsp;
and bill somehow appears to have convinced brigham&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:51.120
he hands them the transponder but as they&nbsp;
head out officers are waiting to arrest them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:56.560
they try to escape and get into a car chase bill&nbsp;
manages to use the transponder and sees the omega&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:01.840
is in an underwater chasm under the louvre before&nbsp;
bill could reset the day they get into a crash&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:06.480
bill wakes up on a hospital bed seeing a&nbsp;
pack of blood getting transfused into him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:12.160
he realizes that he's lost the power and tries&nbsp;
to escape veda finds him and he informs her that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:16.720
he's lost his power and this would be their&nbsp;
final chance bill then tries to get j squad&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:20.160
on board and the squad joins bill as soon&nbsp;
as they see the full metal [ __ ] with him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:25.200
the squad launches into france under the&nbsp;
cover of darkness they're immediately met&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:29.840
with resistance and their transport crashes the&nbsp;
remaining survivors managed to make it to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:34.640
louvre but more of jay squad die with only&nbsp;
vida and bill remaining they head deeper in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:39.920
veda tells bill that he's a good man and she&nbsp;
wishes they had a chance to get to know each other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:44.960
he kisses him before they split up veda tries to&nbsp;
make a distraction for the mimics and bill makes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:50.880
a break for the omega carrying a pack of grenades&nbsp;
and alpha finds vita and kills her it sees bill&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:55.680
heading for the omega but bill manages to dive&nbsp;
into the underwater chasm holding the omega&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:55.680 --> 00:08:00.320
bill tries to swim for the omega grenades in&nbsp;
hand but the alpha stabs him through the chest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:05.120
he drops the grenades and it floats&nbsp;
down to the omega luckily bill removed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:09.840
the pins and the grenades explode with the&nbsp;
omega's death all the mimics cease and die&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:16.240
bill then wakes up inside a helicopter arriving in&nbsp;
london as he lands he sees general brigham making&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:21.040
an announcement that a large surge of energy had&nbsp;
been detected in france and the mimics have died&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:25.280
they had succeeded in defeating the mimics&nbsp;
and bill being covered in the omega's blood&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:29.600
had reset the day once more phil heads to&nbsp;
the training field and meets with a full&nbsp;&nbsp;
