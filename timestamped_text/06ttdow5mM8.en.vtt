00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:16.400
Welcome to Storyflix. In this video, we will
explain, Freehold, an unusual film about a

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.570
shady real estate agent that has no idea that
he's acquired a hidden houseguest. Remaining

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.770
hidden, the guest eats his food, wears his
clothes and even uses his toothbrush. What

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:32.910
was the purpose of the intruder in his apartment?
Let's find out on Freehold. Freehold begins

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.079
in an apartment. A man named Hussein wakes
up from sleep and starts doing his morning

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:44.470
activities. He showered, changed clothes,
and had breakfast. Hussein seems like an office

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:49.540
worker who has a good career. That's why he
was able to make a living and live in a comfortable

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:55.170
apartment. Unfortunately, Hussein was completely
unaware that someone else was living in his

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:01.180
apartment. Every morning, a man named Orlan
starts his activities like Hussein. He cleaned

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.360
his mouth with mouthwash and brushed his teeth
with Hussein's toothbrush. He also wiped his

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.140
body with Hussein's towel. Orlan then had
breakfast. This morning he wanted to eat cereal

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.460
for breakfast by adding milk from Hussein's
refrigerator. He was so enjoying his freedom

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.650
in Hussein's apartment that he even took a
nap in his bed. In the afternoon, Hussein

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.760
who came home from work all day, got a call
from his girlfriend, Mel. It turns out Mel

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.170
was going to visit his apartment in two days,
and she asked Hussein to pick her up at the

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:38.510
airport. Hussein, who was tired from working
all day, immediately fell asleep. That's when

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:43.890
Orlan used to get out of hiding. By moving
quietly between Hussein's deep sleep, Orlan

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.200
began to do activities and enjoy every facility
in that apartment. But the longer he stayed

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.550
in Hussein's apartment, the more Orlan's behaviour
started to get worse. Now he started changing

00:01:54.550 --> 00:02:00.299
the alarm, hoping that Hussein would wake
up late. And sure enough, the following day,

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:05.510
Hussein had to hurry because he was late for
work. Orlan, who was alone in the apartment,

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:10.649
got into action again. He had milk for his
breakfast. He even put tap water in a milk

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.980
bottle. But not only that, Orlan wanted Hussein
to be late to pick up Mel, so he changed the

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:21.400
reminder written on the refrigerator door.
In that apartment, Orlan was alone, so he

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:27.810
often felt lonely. Outside the window, there
were two pigeons who had always been his friends.

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:33.040
Every day, Orlan always feed the two pigeons.
The rest of his time was spent having fun

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.620
and using all of Hussein's equipment. Hussein,
who came home from work, still looks busy

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:44.150
selling some properties. It turns out he worked
as a real estate agent. But that night, he

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:49.950
was seen busy cleaning his kitchen. Moreover,
the milk in the refrigerator had gone stale

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.690
because of Orlan's actions. Because he was
tired of working all day and busy cleaning

00:02:54.690 --> 00:03:00.580
his apartment, Hussein immediately fell asleep.
In the middle of Hussein's deep sleep, Orlan

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:05.520
reappeared and started checking Hussein's
wallet. There he found his credit card. Orlan

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:10.210
wrote down all the important information from
Hussein's credit card. He was sure that the

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:15.920
credit card would be of use to him one day.
The next day, Hussein woke up from his sleep

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.720
and started getting ready to start the day.
But the difference is, today is Saturday,

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:26.980
so he doesn't go to the office to work. Hussein
was also seen busy cleaning his entire apartment.

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.099
Then Mel called and was angry because has
had not yet picked her up at the airport even

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:37.380
though she had been waiting for a long time.
He then immediately went to pick up Mel. That's

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:42.750
when Orlan used to get out of his hiding place
and began to put his spit into Hussein's mouthwash.

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.570
He even wore Hussein's socks and underwear
that had just been washed. Orlan then lures

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:53.030
the two pigeons into the apartment by sprinkling
some breadcrumbs. Sure enough, the pigeon

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:58.450
made a fuss, and Mel became hysterical. Orlan
tried hard to make Mel not feel at home in

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:03.930
the apartment. The two pigeons began to poop
and littered the entire apartment. Now Orlan

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:09.349
must hide longer because there are two people
in the apartment. Mel could not find any food

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:13.629
in Hussein's apartment, even though Hussein
was very sure that he had already stocked

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:20.380
up on food. Mel then went shopping for Hussein.
That night, as a form of apology, Hussein

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:25.220
took Mel out for dinner at a fancy restaurant.
Realizing the empty apartment, Orlan came

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:30.300
out again from his hiding place and finished
Mel's bath soap. He even shaved his armpits

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:35.800
with Hussein's razor. Since Hussein and Mel
were having fancy eating at the restaurant,

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:40.440
Orlan wanted to feel the same way. He started
cooking spaghetti and enjoyed his time in

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:45.130
the apartment as if it were the owner. Not
only that, Orlan started throwing Hussein's

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:49.951
jewellery down the toilet and cutting his
tie. He also used Hussein's mouthwash, but

00:04:49.951 --> 00:04:54.380
this time he put the liquid from his snot
into the mouthwash bottle. Now he's starting

00:04:54.380 --> 00:05:00.130
to replace Mel and Hussein's soap with a floor
cleaner. The next day, Hussein began to get

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:04.770
ready to go out with Mel. He started gargling
with mouthwash and a toothbrush that had been

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:09.680
mixed with Orlan's spit. But he was so shocked
when he couldn't find his earrings. His tie

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:15.669
had even been cut. When Hussein and Mel were
gone, Orlan reappeared and started to do his

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:21.630
actions. Now he uses Mel s laptop to access
porn sites. He even grabbed Mel's underwear

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:26.981
and wiped the snot from his nose. Of course,
his goal was achieved. Now Mel and Hussein

00:05:26.981 --> 00:05:31.889
are fighting, and Mel is starting to get disgusted
with all of Hussein's behavior which he thinks

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:37.490
is starting to be abnormal. That night when
Hussein and Mel were fast asleep, Orlan woke

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:43.470
up and started to poop. But he deliberately
did not flush it. Mel, who found Orlan's poop,

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:49.210
was disgusted and angry. Hussein and Mel then
start fighting and blaming each other. Finally,

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:54.960
Mel could not stand Hussein anymore and decided
to leave and end their relationship. Realizing

00:05:54.960 --> 00:06:00.220
that Mel had left the apartment made Orlan
happy. He started to move on. Now he started

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:05.139
clipping his toenails and putting them under
Hussein's pillow. Orlan then purposely threw

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:09.760
Hussein's cutlery into the toilet and peed
on it. After that, he put them back in their

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:15.330
place. Hussein, who had just returned from
work, was completely oblivious to what Orlan

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:20.180
had done all day. But he started to feel itchy
rashes on his skin because he had been bathing

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:25.870
with floor cleaning soap all this time. After
bathing, Hussein used the filthy spoon to

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:31.070
stir up the medicine and went to bed. But
instead, he smelled a pungent smell from underneath

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:36.789
his pillow. It turns out there he found Orlan's
dirty toenails. Hussein suspected it was Mel's

00:06:36.789 --> 00:06:43.290
doing. The following day before Hussein woke
up, Orlan put his earwax into Hussein's vitamins.

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:49.160
He also put his snot into the mouthwash and
used Hussein's toothbrush to clean his ears.

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:53.720
Hussein who doesn t know, used up all his
dirty toiletries and started to get sick.

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:57.639
That night he woke up with an itchy body.
He then went to the kitchen. Orlan was so

00:06:57.639 --> 00:07:02.460
shocked and immediately hid on a cupboard.
Fortunately, Hussein was seriously ill at

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:07.620
the time and was still not aware of Orlan's
presence in his apartment. When Hussein was

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:12.509
asleep in his sleep, Orlan strikes again.
Now he deleted all of Hussein's scheduled

00:07:12.509 --> 00:07:17.770
meetings and threw away all his toilet paper.
Hussein was getting sicker and suffering so

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:22.800
much. He didn't even come to work the next
day. Hussein began to be confused by all the

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:27.580
oddities in his apartment until two couriers
delivered a freezer. Hussein was pretty sure

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:32.300
he didn't buy the freezer. Strangely the seller
said that Hussein bought the freezer using

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:37.060
his credit card. And we can tell if it was
Orlan who purchased the freezer using Hussein's

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:42.270
credit card. Every day Orlan's actions are
getting to the next level. He took Hussein's

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:47.880
cell phone and took a picture of his dick.
The photo was then sent to his boss. And sure

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:53.240
enough, his boss came and was furious with
Hussein's photo. Hussein was even fired right

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:59.030
then and there. After his boss left, Hussein
began to feel strange in his apartment because

00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:03.970
suddenly, the water in the faucet ran by itself.
Hussein began to believe that he wasn't the

00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:08.580
only one in his apartment. It looks like Orlan
deliberately showed signs of his presence

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:13.480
in the apartment. Hussein started to get suspicious
then checked the whole apartment, but he couldn't

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:18.720
find Orlan. Finally, Hussein called a man
and installed additional locks on his apartment

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:25.229
door. But of course, the keys and locks were
useless because Orlan was already in his apartment.

00:08:25.229 --> 00:08:30.849
Orlan then disturbs Hussein, who is sleeping.
But still, Hussein could not find the whereabouts

00:08:30.849 --> 00:08:35.919
of Orlan in his apartment. Hussein began not
to stand the condition of his skin that was

00:08:35.919 --> 00:08:41.349
getting itchy. Having no job, he spent all
his time at home lazing around and snacking

00:08:41.349 --> 00:08:46.759
all day long. Because he was running out of
money, he began stocking up on frozen food

00:08:46.759 --> 00:08:52.861
at his house. One day, while on his bed, Hussein
finally realized the existence of Orlan, who

00:08:52.861 --> 00:08:58.499
was hiding under his bed; the two then got
into an argument. Orlan started to tell Hussein

00:08:58.499 --> 00:09:02.869
the reason he had been in his apartment all
this time. It turned out that Orlan was a

00:09:02.869 --> 00:09:07.779
former buyer of one of the properties that
Hussein sold. He was disappointed because

00:09:07.779 --> 00:09:12.660
Hussein had deceived him. Hussein's actions
caused Orlan and his girlfriend to become

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:18.199
homeless. At that time, his girlfriend was
pregnant. Finally, his girlfriend decided

00:09:18.199 --> 00:09:23.439
to go and leave him. That's why Orlan broke
into Hussein's apartment to get his revenge.

00:09:23.439 --> 00:09:27.920
He wanted Hussein to experience the bitterness
of life as he had experienced: not having

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:33.870
a partner, not having a job and getting sick
because of an unhealthy lifestyle. The scene

00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:38.579
of this film then changed. It looks like Orlan
doesn't want to live a careless lifestyle

00:09:38.579 --> 00:09:43.399
anymore. He seemed to be busy cleaning the
apartment and changing his appearance by shaving

00:09:43.399 --> 00:09:48.980
his beard. He then began to dress neatly like
Hussein. Now Orlan is ready to start his new

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:54.699
life and find a job and his missing wife and
child. Orlan then took out some breadcrumbs

00:09:54.699 --> 00:10:00.540
and fed the two pigeons. It turned out that
the two pigeons were eating in a freezer.

00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:05.670
Unexpectedly, inside the freezer lay the body
of Hussein, who Orlan had killed. This film

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:27.149
also reaches its end, when Orlan can take
revenge for all that Hussein did to him.
