00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:01.500
Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:06.459
Today, I'm going to explain an action, adventure,
fantasy film called “Chaos Walking.”

00:00:06.459 --> 00:00:07.740
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.520
Watch out and take care.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.200
Humanity has expanded to the stars and found
a new planet called New World.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.440
Upon arrival on the strange planet, a phenomenon
occurred where all the men’s inner thoughts

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.920
become audible and, in some cases, visual.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.040
They dubbed this unusual phenomenon “the
noise.”

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.720
Todd is a young adult living in Prentisstown,
believed to be the only surviving human settlement

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:27.810
on the planet.

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.210
He was born on the planet after his parents
joined an expedition to colonize the New World

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:32.800
several decades ago.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.989
He walks through the woods with his dog Manchee
when he comes across the village preacher,

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:39.160
Aaron.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.090
Todd tries hiding his Noise from Aaron, trying
not to think about sins he may have committed.

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.219
Aaron commands Todd to show his Noise, but
Todd refuses.

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:50.190
Aaron then hits him across the face and declares
hiding noise is akin to being a woman.

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.960
Todd answers he wouldn't know as all the women
had died when he was still an infant.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.739
Todd heads to town, where the mayor's son,
Davy, belittles him, calling him a misfit

00:00:58.739 --> 00:00:59.739
orphan.

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:03.079
Then, Todd manifests a snake with his Noise,
causing Davy to fall off his horse.

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:07.970
But, before they could fight, The mayor, David,
arrives.

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.610
Todd tries hiding his Noise, only thinking
about his name, and David commends the control

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.710
he has over his Noise, saying Davy could learn
from Todd.

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:20.590
Todd then heads home to his adopted family
Cillian and Ben, two farmers living together.

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.760
They all share a meal, and Todd tells them
how he feels a connection with the mayor.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.610
In outer space, a vessel enters the planet's
atmosphere.

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.940
The astronauts discuss the first wave of settlers
and wonder if they've survived since they

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.150
haven't established any contact with them.

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.150
As they enter the planet's atmosphere, the
Noise takes effect, and the men start panicking.

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.250
A fault occurs, and the vessel begins barrelling
through the sky in a ball of fire.

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.630
The following day, Todd spots a stranger stealing
from their barn.

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.549
He and Manchee run after the stranger, but
the thief is too fast.

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.369
He follows the thief and ends up at the spaceship's
crash site.

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.400
He spots several graves on the ground and
hurries back to town to inform the mayor.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.579
Todd then leads the townsfolk to the crash
site and tells the mayor there could be a

00:01:57.579 --> 00:01:59.160
survivor, the thief.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.979
Todd says he didn't get a good look at the
thief, adding that the thief didn't have Noise.

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:05.460
David then orders the men to find the woman
survivor.

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.300
Todd is shocked to hear David say it is a
woman who had survived as he's never seen

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.269
a woman in his whole life.

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:12.419
Todd explores further and finds the woman
hiding.

00:02:12.419 --> 00:02:16.010
He tries to calm the girl down, but his Noise
reveals his desire to call others.

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.510
The woman runs, and the men chase after her.

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.800
David manages to capture her after he manifests
a fence with his Noise, tricking the woman.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.099
They take the woman to town, where David tells
her what has happened to them since they arrived

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:27.099
on the planet.

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:29.319
He explains the Noise only affects men.

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:32.779
The girl asks where the women are, and David
tells her all the women had died at the hands

00:02:32.779 --> 00:02:35.180
of the planet's local inhabitants, the Spackle.

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.450
A war had broken out between the settlers
and the Spackle, which ended in all the women

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:39.559
dying.

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:42.439
The woman then tells David that she and the
rest of the dead astronauts were part of a

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:45.629
scouting expedition preparing for the second
wave of settlers’ arrival.

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:49.189
David appears excited, asking when and where
the ship would land, but the woman is hesitant

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:50.290
to answer.

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.879
David decides to talk to the rest of the townsfolk
and leaves Davy to guard the girl.

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:57.150
Davy can’t resist disturbing the girl as
he, too, has never seen a woman in his whole

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.150
life.

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.209
He starts looking through the girl’s bag,
and the girl tries to stop him, but he fishes

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:04.180
out a gadget that lights up and starts shooting
out lasers.

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.540
David runs back to find that the girl had
escaped.

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.760
The woman crawls under one of the houses and
hears Aaron and David talking.

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.730
David plans to take control of the ship, ambushing
it upon arrival, and Aaron says the woman

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.540
is an angel sent from God to purify them of
their sins.

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.599
The rest of the men then mobilize, beginning
a search for the girl.

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:22.279
Todd enters the room where the girl had been
and takes the girl’s belongings.

00:03:22.279 --> 00:03:26.180
He returns to the farm, eager to begin looking
through the girl’s bag to look for gadgets,

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.019
but Manchee starts barking.

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:31.059
Todd discovers the woman hiding in their barn
and contemplates turning her in but decides

00:03:31.059 --> 00:03:32.079
against it.

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:35.510
He heads back out when a man on horseback
arrives, searching for the girl.

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.219
He notices Todd trying to hide his thoughts
and surmises the girl must be nearby.

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:40.720
He then leaves.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.799
Ben and Cillian immediately understand why
Todd is trying to hide his Noise and enter

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:44.799
the barn.

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:47.150
They see the girl and assure her they won't
harm her.

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.430
They head outside and talk to Todd about what
they intend to do with the girl.

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.639
Todd says they can't surrender her to the
mayor, and Ben and Cillian agree to help Todd

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:54.639
and the girl escape.

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:57.999
Todd doesn't know where to go as he knows
Prentisstown to be the only living settlement

00:03:57.999 --> 00:04:01.930
in the New World, but Ben reveals another
settlement exists; Farbranch.

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.119
Cillian is worried Farbranch wouldn't welcome
them, but Ben says Farbranch would welcome

00:04:05.119 --> 00:04:06.699
him if Todd is with the woman.

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:10.119
Todd prepares to leave, and Cillian advises
him not to tell the people in Farbranch that

00:04:10.119 --> 00:04:11.689
he's from Prentisstown.

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:14.059
Before they could go, David and the others
arrive.

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:17.680
Meanwhile, the girl is in the barn retrieves
her bag and prepares to escape.

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.229
She finds an old motorcycle, fixing it up
with one of her gadgets, and gets it running

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:22.229
again.

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:24.750
Back outside, David demands Todd tell him
where the girl is.

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:29.259
He tries to keep quiet, but his thoughts start
racing, revealing the girl to be in the barn.

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:32.720
As the men open the barn, the girl speeds
out on the motorcycle, and Todd chases after

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:33.720
her.

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.639
The rest of the men start shooting, and Cillian
is fatally wounded.

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:39.169
Todd and the girl maintain their course, running
from the pursuers.

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:42.080
They run into a ravine, and both are thrown
off.

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.580
Todd’s horse gets injured, and the girl’s
motorcycle is decommissioned.

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.960
Todd tells the girl he’s there to help,
promising to take her to Farbranch.

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.590
Thinking she’d find a way to communicate
with the incoming ship and warn them of the

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:53.680
ambush, the girl agrees to go with Todd.

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:58.590
They start making their way towards Farbranch,
and Manchee, the dog, catches up to them.

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:02.370
Ben cradles a dying Cillian back at the farm,
and David forces Ben to reveal where they

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:03.509
had sent Todd.

00:05:03.509 --> 00:05:06.680
Unable to control his Noise, Ben shows Todd
is headed for Farbranch.

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:10.960
David then offers Ben a chance to redeem himself,
asking him to help them bring Todd back.

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.400
As Cillian dies, he lets out one final thought,
asking Ben to keep Todd safe.

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.570
Todd and the girl take a moment to rest and
eat.

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:20.770
Then, Todd catches a creature from a lake
and tries to start a fire.

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:24.440
The girl helps by placing one of her gadgets
near the woodpile, exploding, and providing

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.629
a puff of fire igniting the wood.

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:30.419
They resume their journey, and Todd spots
a massive glow of Noise in the distance.

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:33.639
He tells the girl that the Noise is coming
from a band of spackles, the native species

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:35.400
trying to wipe out the humans.

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.009
They take a different route, avoiding the
spackles.

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:40.880
Rain starts falling, and they take shelter
under a tree.

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:44.370
Todd spots his mother's journal in his backpack,
placed earlier by Ben.

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:46.200
The girl reveals that her parents died too.

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:49.770
They got sick on the ship during the voyage,
and her grandparents raised her.

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:52.870
The girl and Todd lock eyes before she leans
in for a kiss.

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:55.820
Todd kisses her back, but the girl vanishes
into thin air.

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:58.610
Todd is horrified to see that it was just
his inner thoughts manifesting thanks to the

00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:59.789
Noise.

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:03.349
The following morning, the girl tries to wake
Todd up and sees he is dreaming about her,

00:06:03.349 --> 00:06:06.199
his dreams manifesting visually, thanks to
the Noise.

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:10.020
Todd is awakened, and the girl tells him her
name is Viola.

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:13.180
They resume walking and reach a cliff overlooking
a spackle village.

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:16.370
Todd pulls Viola and a barking Manchee to
the side, keeping them quiet.

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:19.550
They rush away but run into a lone Spackle
looking for food.

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:22.280
They hide, but a panicked Todd's noise grows
louder.

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:25.189
He tries to quiet his Noise down, but the
spackle sees it.

00:06:25.189 --> 00:06:27.789
It pounces on Todd and starts dragging him
away.

00:06:27.789 --> 00:06:29.900
Todd breaks free, arming himself with a knife.

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:32.310
He charges the spackle, but it swats him away.

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:35.860
Viola comes face to face with the spackle,
the creature she was told killed all the women

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:39.069
at Prentisstown, but the spackle only looks
at her quizzically.

00:06:39.069 --> 00:06:41.249
Todd tackles the spackle down and starts stabbing
it.

00:06:41.249 --> 00:06:43.840
Viola screams for Todd to stop, and he pauses.

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.820
The spackle breaks loose from Todd and starts
walking away.

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:50.629
Later, Todd says he was only trying to protect
Viola, but Viola noticed that the spackle

00:06:50.629 --> 00:06:52.889
didn’t mind her, only attacking Todd.

00:06:52.889 --> 00:06:56.610
Todd remembers what the mayor said and what
happened in the town, but Viola doubts it.

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:58.819
They then come up to a clearing and find Farbranch.

00:06:58.819 --> 00:07:03.289
They enter Farbranch outskirts, and Todd notices
Farbranch seems to be better than Prentisstown.

00:07:03.289 --> 00:07:07.130
They have livestock, a plantation, and mechanized
farming equipment.

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:10.240
Todd is shocked to see there are women in
Farbranch, some much younger than him.

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:15.650
The town mayor, Hildy, meets with them and
Todd is shocked to see a woman.

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:19.529
Todd is later confronted by several men, telling
him men from Prentisstown are, by law, to

00:07:19.529 --> 00:07:20.529
be hanged.

00:07:20.529 --> 00:07:24.219
Hildy steps in before the situation escalates,
handing Todd his knife back but telling him

00:07:24.219 --> 00:07:25.669
she’ll be watching him.

00:07:25.669 --> 00:07:29.229
Viola and Todd speak with Hildy, and she tells
them that they no longer have the technology

00:07:29.229 --> 00:07:31.800
Viola needs to contact the incoming spaceship.

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:35.279
Viola says she needs to contact the ship because
if they don’t receive a signal from the

00:07:35.279 --> 00:07:37.139
planet, they would move on and leave her stranded.

00:07:37.139 --> 00:07:40.460
They hear Todd's Noise saying he wishes Viola
to stay on the planet.

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:43.569
Hildy then suggests that they head to Haven,
another settlement, where she hopes they would

00:07:43.569 --> 00:07:45.569
find the means to contact the ship.

00:07:45.569 --> 00:07:48.550
Todd is surprised to learn that there are
yet more settlements in New World.

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:51.909
Viola says he and Todd would leave in the
morning, and Todd's Noise reveals his desire

00:07:51.909 --> 00:07:54.050
to have Viola stay with him instead.

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:56.889
They can hear Viola's voice from Todd's Noise
asking him to kiss her.

00:07:56.889 --> 00:07:59.249
Viola is insulted and storms out.

00:07:59.249 --> 00:08:02.449
Todd has trouble sleeping and visits Viola,
who’s having the same problem.

00:08:02.449 --> 00:08:05.939
Viola sees Todd carrying his mother’s journal,
and she offers to read it for him as he never

00:08:05.939 --> 00:08:07.229
learned how to read.

00:08:07.229 --> 00:08:10.419
Viola and Todd find out that everything Mayor
David had told him had been a lie through

00:08:10.419 --> 00:08:11.490
the journal.

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:14.379
It turns out that the men in Prentisstown
slowly grew hateful of the women due to the

00:08:14.379 --> 00:08:16.030
Noise revealing their thoughts.

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:19.930
David and Aaron worked together and started
antagonizing the women in Prentisstown.

00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:23.060
Aaron declared that the women have no noise
because they are soulless.

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:26.180
In her last entry, Todd’s mother writes
she will always love him.

00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:29.449
Todd realizes it was the men that killed all
the women, not the Spackle.

00:08:29.449 --> 00:08:32.380
He storms out, unable to accept that his whole
life had been a lie.

00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:35.269
Soon after, the Prentisstown men arrive.

00:08:35.269 --> 00:08:39.779
The people of Farbranch prepare for a fight,
but it is clear they are outnumbered and outgunned.

00:08:39.779 --> 00:08:43.039
Some of the men lay down their guns, thinking
they would lose if they fought.

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:46.610
Todd returns to Viola and Manchee, and they
try to escape the town discreetly.

00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:50.779
Unfortunately, Aaron sees them, and Todd and
Viola get trapped in a barn.

00:08:50.779 --> 00:08:54.380
David gets to them and brings out Ben to convince
Todd to surrender the girl.

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:56.399
Ben enters and reunites with Todd.

00:08:56.399 --> 00:08:59.390
Todd tells him he knows the truth about what
happened to the women in Prentisstown, and

00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:02.970
Ben apologizes, saying he and Cillian lied
to him only to protect him, but he didn’t

00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:05.589
give a good reason as to why they kept the
truth hidden.

00:09:05.589 --> 00:09:08.260
He then offers to help Todd and Viola escape.

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.310
Ben steps out, and Viola follows him.

00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:13.279
Viola then starts walking to David before
disappearing.

00:09:13.279 --> 00:09:16.810
Ben had fooled David, using his Noise to create
a manifestation of Viola.

00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:21.130
Todd, Manchee, and Viola reach a river, but
Aaron catches up to them.

00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:24.660
They get on a boat and start paddling away,
but Aaron takes his horse into the river,

00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:25.779
getting closer.

00:09:25.779 --> 00:09:28.570
They reach some river rapids, and Aaron manages
to gain on them.

00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:32.639
He reaches the boat, pulling Viola into the
water, capsizing the boat.

00:09:32.639 --> 00:09:36.209
Manchee and Viola are thrown off, and Todd
has to keep Viola afloat as she never learned

00:09:36.209 --> 00:09:37.510
how to swim.

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:41.470
Todd and Viola reach the capsized boat, but
Todd sees Aaron has captured Manchee.

00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:44.290
The preacher holds Manchee underwater, drowning
him.

00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:47.750
Todd screams in anguish as he hears his beloved
Manchee’s whimpering gasps for air grow

00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:49.480
weaker and weaker.

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:52.980
Todd and Viola wash up a fair distance away,
and Viola could hear Todd trying to hide his

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:55.190
Noise, filled with thoughts of Manchee.

00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:58.350
They continue walking, and Todd swears he
would avenge Manchee.

00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:01.960
The pair end up at a structure towering over
the forest, and Viola remembers seeing blueprints

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:05.240
of the structure back in her ship, saying
it's for a monorail track.

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:08.850
She then finds Todd sitting in silence, his
Noise manifesting a jolly Manchee jumping

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:11.830
up and down, happily barking and running the
fields.

00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:16.259
Seeing Todd distraught over the loss of Manchee,
Viola sits next to him, saying she liked Manchee,

00:10:16.259 --> 00:10:18.750
telling Todd Manchee was the best dog she
ever knew.

00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:21.699
Todd jokingly replies Manchee was the only
dog she ever knew.

00:10:21.699 --> 00:10:24.560
Viola then holds his hand, telling him he
is a good man.

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:27.579
She then playfully tells Todd she’s not
going to kiss him, alluring to Todd’s inner

00:10:27.579 --> 00:10:29.079
thoughts manifesting earlier.

00:10:29.079 --> 00:10:32.520
They continue walking and reach the remnants
of a massive ship.

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:35.600
Todd theorizes it must be the ship the first
wave of inhabitants used.

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:39.110
Viola then decides to go into the ship to
find a communication beacon to signal to the

00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:40.399
second wave’s ship.

00:10:40.399 --> 00:10:44.190
They climb into the vessel, and Viola finds
an emergency communication beacon.

00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:47.529
She powers it up and initiates it, but the
antenna has been disconnected.

00:10:47.529 --> 00:10:51.329
Todd decides to climb up and reattach the
antenna, but David sees him.

00:10:51.329 --> 00:10:55.120
The Prentisstown men ride in, surrounding
the ship, and Todd successfully reattaches

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:56.259
the antenna.

00:10:56.259 --> 00:11:00.019
The beacon is ready, but before Viola could
turn it on, Aaron suddenly shows up, pulling

00:11:00.019 --> 00:11:01.339
Viola away.

00:11:01.339 --> 00:11:05.740
At the same time, David calls Todd, threatening
to shoot Ben if he doesn’t reveal himself.

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:09.880
Meanwhile, Aaron has Viola pinned down, confessing
to her how he had killed so many women, showing

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:11.140
them no mercy.

00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:13.519
The Noise had corrupted him, broken his mind.

00:11:13.519 --> 00:11:16.420
Now, he wants Viola to kill him to purify
his sin.

00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:19.850
Viola takes a firestarter device from her
pocket and throws it at Aaron, making him

00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:21.340
burst into flames.

00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:24.050
Aaron rejoices as he is being baptized in
fire.

00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:25.670
He walks away, embracing his death.

00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:28.110
Viola shakes off the confusion and turns the
beacon on.

00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:31.700
Todd faces David outside, but Todd still hides
Viola's location.

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:33.470
David then shoots Ben.

00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:35.680
Todd rushes to Ben, but Ben's injuries are
too great.

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:38.520
Ben pulls out a knife, handing it to Todd.

00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:42.160
Todd then uses the distraction to attack David,
but David counters him.

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:44.330
Todd gets pushed off, tumbling down.

00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:48.500
The beacon starts transmitting, and Todd runs
to hide, but David shoots him, hitting Todd's

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:49.500
chest.

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:52.670
Todd hides under a metal part of the ship
and sees David walking past.

00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:56.310
He tries to grab David, but it was only an
illusion from David's Noise.

00:11:56.310 --> 00:11:59.310
David then drags Todd, using his Noise to
confuse the boy.

00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:02.740
Todd is pushed near a large deep opening,
and David holds him at gunpoint.

00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:07.079
With the remaining strength he has, Todd uses
his Noise to create an illusion of his mother.

00:12:07.079 --> 00:12:10.440
David sees Todd's mother and other women,
and he gets scared, backing himself towards

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:11.440
the edge.

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:15.100
Viola appears from behind the illusion with
a club, swinging it at David.

00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:19.259
David catches the club, but Viola lets go,
causing David to fall over the edge.

00:12:19.259 --> 00:12:21.930
Todd awakens inside the spaceship with his
wounds healed.

00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:26.220
He and Viola stand by the ship’s window,
seeing the second wave of settlers have unloaded.

00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:37.160
Todd and Viola hopefully watch as a new settlement
is built.
