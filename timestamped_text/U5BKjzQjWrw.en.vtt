00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.440
Welcome back to Movie Recaps.&nbsp;
Today I will show you a crime,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:09.440
drama, mystery film from 2001, titled The Glass&nbsp;
House. Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.480
The film opens up with teenage girl Ruby Baker&nbsp;
enjoying a horror movie at the theatre with her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.440
friends. She isn't very scared, but at least they&nbsp;
get a good laugh out of it. When the film is over,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.960
one of the girls wonders where they should go&nbsp;
next, but Ruby says she should return home.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.840
She can't afford to have another argument with her&nbsp;
parents, they believe her to be sleeping. The next&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.520
morning, she's shown having breakfast with her&nbsp;
parents and her brother Rhett before leaving for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.760
school. There she meets her friends and they&nbsp;
make plans together to go out again later.&nbsp;

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.760
That night, David and Grace go to a restaurant&nbsp;
to celebrate their twentieth anniversary.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.920
Unknown to them, Ruby also goes out to spend&nbsp;
the evening smoking, speeding and going to a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.320
rave with her friends, they also laugh at how much&nbsp;
her parents trust her. When she makes it home, she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.320
puts on perfume to cover the smoke smell before&nbsp;
noticing there's a police car waiting outside,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.400
making her think her parents called the cops&nbsp;
on her. She goes inside and tells the officers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.680
she isn't missing, but they aren't there for&nbsp;
her: they've come because her parents have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.120
been in a car accident and didn't make&nbsp;
it. The shocking news makes her faint.&nbsp;

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.560
A day or two later, they have a funeral. During&nbsp;
the corresponding mass, Rhett wants to say some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.120
words, but he's too upset to manage it. It's then&nbsp;
that we're introduced to Doctor Erin Glass and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:18.160
Terry Glass, close friends of the family. They&nbsp;
take over Rhett and make a very touching speech.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.240
When the mass is over, Ruby is approached&nbsp;
outside by her uncle Jack, who offers his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.560
help with anything she may need. Ruby wonders&nbsp;
how come she hasn't seen him in ten years,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.120
Jack replies he and her mom grew apart, he&nbsp;
also points out he leaves very far away.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.560
She doesn't take him very seriously and&nbsp;
just thanks him before leaving for her home.&nbsp;

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.160
At her house, a home funeral is being held.&nbsp;
The place is crowded and so Ruby stays in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.880
kitchen to have a moment by herself, but she's&nbsp;
found by Alvin Begleiter, the family lawyer.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.680
He informs her that she and Rhett&nbsp;
will be taken in by the Glasses,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.520
and that her parents have left them enough money&nbsp;
not to worry about it ever again. Begleiter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.360
gives Ruby his card and leaves the room as the&nbsp;
Glasses enter it to hug Ruby and comfort her.&nbsp;

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.240
Some days later, Rhett and Ruby leave their empty&nbsp;
house behind to move to Malibu with Erin and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.640
Terry. When they make it there, they're surprised&nbsp;
to find the house is huge and mostly made of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.520
glass. Terry gives them a tour of the house while&nbsp;
Erin gets some food ready - he shows them around,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.640
introduces them to the housekeeper and&nbsp;
then takes them to what will be their room,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.960
which they'll have to share for now. Neither&nbsp;
of the siblings looks happy about this. Later&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.640
that evening, Erin serves some fancy food&nbsp;
the siblings aren't willing to even touch,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.680
so she has to order pizza instead. When bedtime&nbsp;
comes, Rhett is still awake and fooling around,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:31.040
so Ruby goes out to the hallway to change. Someone&nbsp;
seems to be watching her. Ruby hears a noise and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.000
when she turns around, she sees a shadow leaving.
It's time to go to their new school the next day,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.080
which will be public instead of private. Ruby&nbsp;
introduces herself to her new class with a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.720
successful joke, but things get awkward when they&nbsp;
ask her why she moved to Malibu. After school,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.360
when the siblings return to their room, they find&nbsp;
gifts: a bunch of videogame consoles for Rhett,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.760
and tons of clothes for Ruby. Moments later,&nbsp;
Ruby is telling a friend on the phone about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.320
her new school while watching tv: she complains&nbsp;
about all the kids being too well behaved and not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.400
able to see how they've lost their liberties,&nbsp;
like the fact they can't use pagers at school.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.720
Her chat is interrupted by Erin, who calls her&nbsp;
over to the kitchen. While they're putting away&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.800
the groceries, Erin tells her she should have a&nbsp;
better attitude towards her new school: turns out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.840
she had been listening to her phone conversation.
Later that night, while in bed, Ruby believes her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.680
mom is there to wake her up, but when she suddenly&nbsp;
sits up in the bed she realizes it was just a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.560
dream. Too upset to sleep now, she changes into&nbsp;
a bathing suit and goes for a swim at the house's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.800
own pool. All is going well until a presence&nbsp;
startles out of it: it's Terry, who has been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.040
woken up by the noise. He says he thought it was&nbsp;
an intruder because he isn't used to having kids&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.840
around. He helps her out of the pool and gives&nbsp;
her a towel as he stares at her inappropriately.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.920
He bans night swimming from now on, since the&nbsp;
glass allows all noise to go through, and says&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.400
he'll start setting up the alarm at night.
Another day at school, Ruby is shown a video&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.320
about drunk driving, which makes her think about&nbsp;
her parents' accident and upsets her in class.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.960
She continues to be upset later at dinner when&nbsp;
the Glasses ask her about her drive ed classes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:59.920
so she excuses herself and goes to the bathroom&nbsp;
to search for some pain-killers. Erin finds her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.480
there and tries to comfort her, Ruby lies and&nbsp;
says this is about her having her period. Erin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:09.200
takes her to her own bathroom, where Ruby finds&nbsp;
out she's keeping a big amount of pharmaceuticals.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.960
Ruby's given a pill that turns out isn't&nbsp;
just a pain killer: when she goes to bed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:16.560
she's too relaxed and spaced out, not even&nbsp;
bothered by Rhett's videogame playing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.360
A couple of hours later, she wakes up to find&nbsp;
Rhett sleeping on the floor in front of the tv.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:24.880
As she drags him to his bed, she hears&nbsp;
Erin and Terry arguing and steps out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.160
of the room to take a look, Terry closes&nbsp;
the curtains as soon as he sees her there.&nbsp;

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.880
Next day at school, a classmate asks Ruby&nbsp;
about the rumor of her having been on academic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.520
probation. Ruby explains about the time she had&nbsp;
gone partying instead of doing her homework,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.360
so she downloaded the essay from the internet&nbsp;
and handed it in, but she was busted.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.600
When she goes back home, Terry asks her to&nbsp;
come with him to a premiere. Ruby says she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.840
has homework to do, but Terry tells her she will&nbsp;
have enough time, so she accepts to go with him.&nbsp;

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:55.360
In the end, however, Terry doesn't drive them to&nbsp;
the premiere, he takes them to a restaurant. While&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:00.160
eating, he reminiscence about the day he met the&nbsp;
Bakers. Ruby takes the chance to ask him if last&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.320
night's argument was about them, and Terry says&nbsp;
no, it was just usual married couple stuff and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:09.040
being married to Erin can be lonely. She points&nbsp;
out it's her bedtime, so Terry drives her back,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:13.920
but he's doing so rather fast and wildly. After&nbsp;
almost crashing against another car, Terry pulls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:17.920
over and leans in towards her in a very creepy&nbsp;
manner, then claims it was just to help her fasten&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:21.920
her seatbelt. When they make it to the house,&nbsp;
Ruby goes to the living-room to pick up her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:26.800
books and finds a baked Erin injecting herself.
Worried about all the things she's noticing, the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.960
next day after class she goes to visit Begleiter&nbsp;
to tell him all about it. Begleiter reminds her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.400
that if it doesn't work out with the Glasses,&nbsp;
the siblings will become wards of the state.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.720
Ruby points out that she made the housekeeper&nbsp;
drive her all the way from Malibu then hitchhiked,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:42.480
which made her very scared but kept going&nbsp;
because she was sure Begleiter would help her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:46.400
Begleiter says he'll see what he can do and,&nbsp;
when Ruby asks him how much money her parents&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.720
left them, he says it's four million dollars.&nbsp;
After Ruby leaves, he makes a phone call.&nbsp;

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:55.920
Night falls. After dinner, the Glasses&nbsp;
dismiss Rhett so they can talk to Ruby.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:59.360
They tell her that what she saw last night&nbsp;
was Erin giving herself insulin injections&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:04.320
for her diabetes. They also mention how she got&nbsp;
skittish around Terry, they ask her to trust them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:08.400
She replies she may've overreacted.
The next day, Ruby is never picked up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:13.520
from driving school, so she walks all the way to&nbsp;
GTI, Terry's company. The receptionist tells her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:17.840
to wait in the lounge, and there, Ruby sees Terry&nbsp;
being threatened by loan sharks he owes money to.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:22.720
When Terry is violently pushed against the glass&nbsp;
wall, she gets scared and decides to go wait in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:26.880
the repair shop, where she freaks out when she&nbsp;
finds her parents' car. She can't investigate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:31.120
much because it's at that moment that Terry comes&nbsp;
to pick her up to take her home. On their way back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:35.600
to the house, Ruby tells him she had to show up at&nbsp;
the shop because the housekeeper didn't show up.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:39.280
Terry explains he's fired her and Erin was&nbsp;
supposed to pick her up instead, but she got&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:44.160
held up at the hospital. Ruby asks why he fired&nbsp;
the housekeeper, Terry confesses he knows she had&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:48.240
driven her out of Malibu without his permission&nbsp;
and that is their job to know everything. During&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:52.240
dinner that night, Ruby sees Terry put on the code&nbsp;
for the house alarm and secretly writes down the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:57.120
numbers. A few hours later, Ruby pretends to be&nbsp;
doing her homework but she's actually looking at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:01.680
an article online about her parents' accident -&nbsp;
it mentions the wrong car. She writes an e-mail&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:06.160
to Begleiter asking him about it. Too upset to&nbsp;
finish her homework now, she ends up falling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:10.960
asleep in front of the computer, where Terry finds&nbsp;
her. He smiles when he sees the unfinished essay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:15.200
on the screen. The next morning, Ruby wakes up&nbsp;
still there, and finds someone had finished the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:19.360
essay for her. She thanks Terry for the help,&nbsp;
he replies that would be wrong but winks at her.&nbsp;

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:23.920
Later at school, Ruby is summoned to have a&nbsp;
meeting with an inspector for social services.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:27.680
Ruby tells her about all the weird things&nbsp;
that she's noticed around the house,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:30.880
but she's worried that the agent going&nbsp;
to check it out will get her in trouble.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:34.480
The agent tells her she'll say is just a routine&nbsp;
check and Ruby can pretend not to know her.&nbsp;

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:39.280
When the agent shows up at the house a couple&nbsp;
of days later, the Glasses were ready for her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:43.120
They had prepared separate rooms for the siblings,&nbsp;
put away Rhett's videogames and hid all the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:48.000
pharmaceuticals. When the agent asks Rhett what he&nbsp;
does in the evenings, he lies and says he reads.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:53.120
Once the Glasses are out of the room, Ruby scolds&nbsp;
him for it, and he says he's learned it from her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:56.320
Angry, she grabs the box he's holding&nbsp;
and goes to throw it in the thrash,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:00.320
where she finds two very important documents.&nbsp;
One is a letter from a private school saying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:03.840
they're sorry the Glasses won't send their kids&nbsp;
there so they'll return the registration fee.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:08.240
The other one is a postcard from their uncle&nbsp;
Jack, checking on them and asking them to call.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:13.600
Ruby tears off his phone number to keep.
A few hours later, in the middle of the night,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:17.440
Ruby is working on the computer when Terry&nbsp;
passes by to ask if she likes her new room,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:20.560
she replies it couldn't have come at&nbsp;
a better time. After Terry's gone,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:25.280
she tries to contact Begleiter through e-mail, she&nbsp;
finds out her internet account has been closed. A&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:29.840
phone rings and Terry picks it up, it's the loan&nbsp;
sharks demanding their money. Ruby picks up a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:34.000
different phone to listen on the conversation and&nbsp;
is almost discovered by Terry, but she hides just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.440
in time. She hears Terry mention he's found a new&nbsp;
personal piggy bank. After Terry goes back to bed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:43.280
Ruby uses a special code on the phone to find&nbsp;
out where the call came from and save the number.&nbsp;

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.960
At school, Ruby is unsettled, so she leaves the&nbsp;
classroom to call Begleiter through the payphone.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:52.880
She tells him he hasn't gotten his e-mails because&nbsp;
Terry busted her account, so he tells her what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:57.680
he's found out then: the BMW her parents drove the&nbsp;
night of the accident belonged to Terry's company.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:01.440
It makes her think the accident was a trap&nbsp;
prepared by Terry, but she cannot tell him this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:05.440
because her teacher interrupts the conversation to&nbsp;
take her to see the vice principal. They've found&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:09.440
out her essay had been plagiarized from a book,&nbsp;
they also somehow know she's done this before.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.840
The vice principal has already told the Glasses&nbsp;
about the incident, and tells Ruby she isn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:18.480
sure she can continue in that school. Later&nbsp;
at home, Erin tries to talk to Ruby about it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:23.360
and Ruby blames Terry for it. But Terry says it's&nbsp;
time she starts taking personal responsibility.&nbsp;

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000
It's 4am in the house when Ruby decides to&nbsp;
leave her bed and change out of her pajamas.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:32.640
She goes to the living room, where she finds a&nbsp;
flier from an all female boarding school before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:37.520
trying to reach her uncle Jack on the phone, only&nbsp;
to get the answering machine. With a plan in mind,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:41.120
Ruby steals Terry's car keys, wakes up&nbsp;
her brother to make him come with her and,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:44.480
after turning off the alarm with the code&nbsp;
she learned the other day, they take a car&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:49.920
and escape the house. The noise wakes Terry up.
The siblings can't go very far, however, because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:54.560
the highway is closed thanks to a mud slide. The&nbsp;
cop that explains this to her is suspicious of her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:59.120
age and asks for her license and registration,&nbsp;
which she of course doesn't have. The officer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:02.560
asks her to step out of the car just as the&nbsp;
Glasses arrive to take them back to the house.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:06.720
On the drive back, Ruby accuses Terry of&nbsp;
having killed her parents for the money,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:09.120
he denies it but he's clearly&nbsp;
shaken by the accusation.&nbsp;

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:13.600
When they reach the house, Ruby tries to run&nbsp;
away as soon as she gets out of the car, but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:18.480
Terry drags her inside. They struggle until Terry&nbsp;
manages to pin her to the floor, telling her that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:22.080
they don't need her because they also have Rhett&nbsp;
and one kid is enough to get access to the trust.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:26.720
Ruby calls out for Erin, who does show up but only&nbsp;
to inject her with a sedative to put her to sleep.&nbsp;

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:32.080
A quick cut to Ruby's old friends tells us a month&nbsp;
has passed and none of them have heard from her.&nbsp;

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:36.320
Back to Terry, he receives another call from the&nbsp;
loan sharks but doesn't manage to buy more time.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:39.680
Getting desperate, he goes visits&nbsp;
the trustee the next day to try to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:43.040
get some money under the pretense it is&nbsp;
to build a new area for the siblings.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:46.800
The trustee is suspicious, though, because he&nbsp;
had gotten the school letter Ruby found in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:52.320
trash faxed to him. Terry's request is denied.
Meanwhile, in the hospital, Erin is lying about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:56.160
the amount of medicine her patients are taking&nbsp;
so she can ask for more and steal it for herself.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:56.720 --> 00:11:00.960
Her conversation with the pharmacy is interrupted&nbsp;
when she's asked to go see the medical director.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:04.720
We find out later at the house that Ruby has&nbsp;
been sedated all this time, and that Erin's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:08.720
losing her medical license for stealing the&nbsp;
pharmaceuticals she uses to keep Ruby down and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:13.520
also her own addiction. Terry and Erin argue about&nbsp;
their problems, and we learn Erin only became a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:18.160
junkie after Terry killed the Bakers. Erin wants&nbsp;
out, but Terry says this is already done and they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:22.480
must contain the damage. He also says they need&nbsp;
to get rid of Ruby and since Erin doesn't have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:26.160
access to sedatives anymore, he leaves the&nbsp;
house to see if he can acquire some himself.&nbsp;

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:31.200
Erin still has one last secret syringe left.&nbsp;
When she picks it up from its hiding spot,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:35.040
she finds some old homemade videos and decides&nbsp;
to watch one. It's about her playing with little&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:39.440
Ruby on the beach. Guilt takes over her&nbsp;
so Erin overdoses herself before going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:43.840
upstairs where Ruby finds her body next to her&nbsp;
on the bed the next morning. A few hours later,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:47.760
Terry returns to the house after having acquired&nbsp;
some morphine and finds her wife's body,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:52.480
he also hears Ruby on the phone, giving someone&nbsp;
their address. He goes after her, but she sneaks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:56.640
around and takes her brother with her to hide.
While Terry continues to search the house for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:56.640 --> 00:12:01.040
them, Rhett tries to leave through the front door&nbsp;
only to be jumped on by Terry. He drags Rhett&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:05.280
back inside, but Ruby hits him before running&nbsp;
away with her brother. Terry catches up with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:09.680
them and captures them, then locks them up in the&nbsp;
basement. The siblings find out there is a window&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:13.440
down there and start working on destroying the&nbsp;
net that covers it with a wrench they find around.&nbsp;

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:19.200
Meanwhile, Terry works on sabotaging his Jaguar.&nbsp;
Through the window, the siblings see him pull out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:23.840
the Jaguar and park it outside before going back&nbsp;
to the house to nap. Taking advantage of this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:27.920
Rhett manages to escape through the now broken&nbsp;
window and steal the keys from Terry, after he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:31.920
leaves we see Terry had been awake the whole&nbsp;
time and is only pretending to sleep. The kids&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:36.080
leave the basement and see Terry on the couch,&nbsp;
Ruby finds how easy this is very suspicious.&nbsp;

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:41.200
The doorbell rings then. Ruby hides with Rhett&nbsp;
behind a wall and they watch Terry open the door&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:45.360
for Begleiter, who's come personally because&nbsp;
Terry wouldn't pick up the phone. He informs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:49.200
him the bank has blocked his guardianship&nbsp;
account and there's an ongoing investigation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:52.960
We learn then that it was Begleiter that had been&nbsp;
informing the Glasses of all of Ruby's moves,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:55.520
but only because he thought he could&nbsp;
trust them since the Bakers did,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:59.440
and now he sees he may've been wrong. Ruby&nbsp;
understands he had thought he was helping them.&nbsp;

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:04.000
A red car suddenly parks outside and two&nbsp;
men come out: they're the loan sharks.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.720
They enter the house and explain they were given&nbsp;
a call by Terry's wife, but it was actually Ruby.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:13.440
They ask for the money, Terry says he doesn't have&nbsp;
it and blames Begleiter for it. The lawyer tries&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:17.760
to leave, but he gets stabbed by the sharks.&nbsp;
Terry thinks that solves the problem, but the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:22.800
sharks don't leave, they want to take Terry with&nbsp;
them in the Jaguar. As they go outside, Ruby tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:26.480
Rhett to wait and sneaks out of the house.
While they're tying up his hands with tape,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:30.560
Terry convinces them to take the Volvo instead&nbsp;
of the Jaguar, but when they open the garage,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:34.800
they find the Volvo's tires had been slashed.&nbsp;
Terry freaks out and the sharks cover his mouth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:38.560
with tape as well, one of them takes the red&nbsp;
car and the other goes with Terry in the Jaguar.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:42.800
Ruby watches them drive away with a knife in&nbsp;
her hand, she was the one that cut the tires.&nbsp;

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:48.640
On the road, the Jaguar starts losing control. It&nbsp;
hits the red car, sending it to crash against a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:53.520
truck. After dodging a couple of cars more, the&nbsp;
Jaguar goes off the rails and crashes as well.&nbsp;

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:59.360
Sometime later, we find the siblings walking down&nbsp;
the road hand in hand. A police car stops next to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:04.080
them and the officer asks them to get in for help,&nbsp;
they accept. A little later, they drive by the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:08.960
destroyed red car, where cops are already taking&nbsp;
care of the situation. They keep going and find&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:13.360
the second crash, the cop stops and leaves the&nbsp;
car to investigate, but he is knocked out by Terry&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:18.320
after he asks for reinforcements. Terry steals his&nbsp;
gun and goes after the kids, when they see him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:22.720
Ruby jumps on the driver's seat and desperately&nbsp;
searches for the keys. Terry is almost on them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:27.520
when she finally finds them and starts the car,&nbsp;
drives it back but suddenly stops. Rhett freaks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:31.840
out while Ruby remembers her parents' accident, so&nbsp;
she tells him to buckle up while doing so herself&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:36.080
before driving the car into Terry, killing him&nbsp;
as he's about to shoot. The kids leave the car&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:40.320
and hug as more cops arrive to rescue them.
The movie ends with the siblings visiting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:43.840
their parents' grave together with their uncle,&nbsp;
who promises them they'll have a good life.
