00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.670
Welcome back for another 5 minute movie recap.

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:07.340
Today, I'm going to give you an overview of
the 2017 American psychological horror thriller

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.610
film called 'Geralds Game'.

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:12.870
There will be Spoilers ahead, so please proceed
with caution.

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.839
Jessie and Gerald take a vacation at an isolated
lake home in Fairhope, Alabama.

00:00:17.839 --> 00:00:22.079
Jessie feeds a stray dog outside as Gerald
takes Viagra, but when she returns home, she

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:23.909
leaves the door open.

00:00:23.909 --> 00:00:27.869
Jessie changes into a fresh slip and tries
sensual postures while placing the tag on

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.019
a shelf above the bed.

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:34.760
Gerald takes another Viagra and places his
glass of water on the same shelf as his first.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.320
He binds Jessie's wrists to the bedposts with
one set of handcuffs on each wrist; she appears

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.440
shocked, but follows ahead.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.650
He starts acting out a stranger rape fantasy,
asking her to cry for assistance even though

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.660
he knows no one would hear her.

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.710
She goes along half-heartedly at first, but
soon feels uneasy and tells him to stop and

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.020
uncuff her; he responds, 'What if I dont?'

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.960
Gerald dies of a heart attack after a violent
fight in which he blames her of not even attempting

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.360
to renew their relationship, leaving Jessie
imprisoned in the shackles.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.899
A few of hours have passed.

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:08.460
Jessie attempts to frighten the dog away with
the open door, but it takes a piece out of

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.719
Gerald's arm and eats it.

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:14.780
Gerald gets up and starts chatting, expressing
his dissatisfaction with the lost flesh and

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.140
muscle on his arm, but Jessie observes that
his body is still on the floor.

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.979
He teases Jessie about their tumultuous marriage
and his sexual problems.

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.770
He then warns her that she has already squandered
hours doing nothing and is beginning to feel

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.039
dehydrated and tired.

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:33.020
Jessie magically removes a hand from a cuff
and manages to break free.

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.070
She gloats to Gerald before turning around
and telling herself, who is still confined,

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.149
that escaping is simple.

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:42.700
Gerald and the confident Jessie reveal things
about herself and Gerald that she has never

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.039
had the guts to admit.

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:48.110
They remind her of the glass of water on the
nightstand above her bed, which she can reach

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.429
but not bring all the way to her mouth.

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:54.119
The hallucinations remind her of the shelf
tag she placed there, which she uses as a

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.689
drinking straw to get to the water.

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:01.140
Jessie falls asleep and awakens in the dark
to find a towering, misshapen, veiled person

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.329
holding a bag containing different bones and
baubles.

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:06.920
'You're not real,' she says as she shuts her
eyes.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.260
Gerald, on the other hand, appears to suggest
that the apparition is Death, who is about

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.040
to take her away.

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.330
Gerald starts calling Jessie 'Mouse,' which
makes her uncomfortable.

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.440
This brings back memories of her father Tom,
who fondly called her 'Mouse,' having her

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.710
sit on his lap as he masturbated to her while
the two watched a solar eclipse when she was

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:26.380
12 years old.

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.470
Gerald and Jessie's image of herself tease
Jessie as she loses sensation in her arm,

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.420
telling her that she never healed from the
attack and that she married a guy who looks

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.370
just like her father.

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.430
Gerald taunts Jessie about the deformed guy
she saw, whom he refers to as 'the moonlight

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.720
man,' and points to a bloodied footprint on
the floor.

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.980
Jessie recalls cutting her hand the night
of the attack when her mother asked her about

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.700
the eclipse and she gripped a glass too hard.

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.010
Jessie, now an adult, breaks the water glass
and slashes her wrist in such a way that she

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.580
can peel back the flesh and slip her bleeding
hand through the cuff.

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.390
She drags the bed over to the key, which she
unlocks with her other hand.

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.510
She drinks water and wraps her hand in bandages
before collapsing on the floor from exhaustion

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:05.950
and blood loss.

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.690
The 'guy made of moonlight' appears at the
end of the hall when she wakes up, and she

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.960
offers him her wedding ring in exchange for
his trinket bag.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:17.350
She gets to her car and drives away, but she
notices the man in the rear seat again.

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.610
The vehicle collides with a tree, but residents
in a nearby home emerge.

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.330
Six months later, Jessie is attempting to
write a letter to her 12-year-old self with

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:26.750
her injured hand.

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.880
Voice-overs and scenes reveal how she claimed
to have amnesia about the entire ordeal of

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.770
being confined in order to avoid asking uncomfortable
questions.

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:39.100
She started a charity for sexual assault victims
with some of Gerald's life insurance.

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.720
However, as she falls asleep each night, the
'guy made of moonlight' emerges in front of

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:44.720
her.

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.220
Her wedding ring was never discovered in the
home, and she learned about a serial murderer

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.840
with acromegaly who digs up crypts, steals
bones and jewels, and eats the faces of male

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.270
victims from the news; this explains why he
didn't hurt Jessie at the house, as well as

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:59.640
why Gerald's face was deformed.

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:04.490
As the moonlit man is being sentenced, Jessie
appears in court and demands his attention.

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:08.270
He quotes her words before leaving the home,
implying that he was present.

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:11.920
'You're so much smaller than I remember,'
she exclaims triumphantly as she goes out

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.760
onto the street with the sun shining down
on her.
