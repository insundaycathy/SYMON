00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:01.670
Welcome to Moviecaps.

00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:07.009
Today I will show you an Adventure, Drama,
Romance film from 2000, titled The Beach.

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:08.490
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.019
Watch out and take care.

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.329
Richard arrives in Thailand looking for something
more exciting.

00:00:13.329 --> 00:00:18.330
He is staying in a run-down hotel and when
he can't get into his room, a girl, Françoise,

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.189
who is staying in the next room with her boyfriend
Étienne, helps him out.

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:26.339
As he lies in bed, he hears them doing the
business through the thin walls.

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:29.829
Then he is interrupted by a madman from the
other room, Daffy.

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:33.320
He tells Richard about a secluded beach on
a secret, forbidden island.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.730
He does not believe such a place exists, but
when he returns the next day, he finds a map

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.149
pinned to his door.

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.060
He goes to check on Daffy, but finds that
he has taken his own life.

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.629
After talking to the police, he shows his
neighbours the map and tells them about the

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:48.000
secret island.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.559
They all seem excited to go where no tourist
does and Étienne figures out the logistics.

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.180
They travel 500 miles in one day and end up
on a beach somewhere.

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.410
Étienne points out that the island is a national
park and off limits, but they can get to a

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.879
nearby island and swim from there.

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.330
Once again, Richard can not get into his room
because this time he lost his key, but the

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.950
2 surfers next to him invite him to join them.

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.800
They talk about the mythical island with a
perfect beach with pure white sand and crystal

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.720
clear water, but think it's just an urban
myth.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.160
Before Richard continues his journey the next
day, he leaves them a copy of the map.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.900
They take a boat to their second to last destination
and camp through the night.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.670
Richard is awakened by Françoise taking pictures
of the night sky.

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.520
He says that there's probably a planet like
theirs somewhere in the infinite universe,

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.040
with another version of them photographing
back.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.140
She says it's the usual pretentious crap Americans
always say to French girls to sleep with them.

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.290
The next day, the trio tries to estimate the
distance they have to swim, thinking they

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.840
won't make it if it's too far, but Richard
exclaims, "If we don't try, we will never

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.210
know," and excitedly jumps in.

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.920
After a long, exhausting swim, they finally
reach the shore.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.920
They head inland and find a massive hemp plantation.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.710
Richard notices a monkey tied by a string
to a sleeping man with an AK-47.

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.340
The monkey wakes him up and the three hide
in the field.

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.420
A bunch of other guards show up and start
looking for them.

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.380
The monkey finds them, but Richard sprays
it with water and they manage to get out unnoticed.

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.150
After this, the couple starts getting second
thoughts, but Richard is determined to find

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.810
the paradise on earth, so they follow.

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.799
The group heads downstream and reaches a waterfall
over a massive cliff.

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:28.349
The boys argue about how to get down, but
Françoise just jumps and encourages the others,

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:30.340
so they follow shortly after.

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.430
They cheer and shout because of the exhilarating
experience, but are suddenly interrupted by

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.019
a man named Keaty, clapping.

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:40.190
He says it took him an hour to muster up the
courage to jump.

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.109
He then takes them to the village.

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:46.209
They expected a couple of passing travellers
staying in caves, but find a thriving community

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:50.040
that actually lives here long term and realize
they weren't even invited.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.790
They are taken to the leader of the community,
Sal, and show her the map Duffy made.

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.360
She tells them that Daffy was one of the founders
of the community, but he went insane.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.910
She explains that they value their privacy
and asks if they made a map for anyone else.

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.670
They all deny it and she seems satisfied and
burns the map.

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.230
The trio is taken to the beach at a lagoon
with crystal clear blue water, enveloped by

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:13.230
cliffs.

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.249
They take in its beauty, thrilled that they
have actually reached their destination and

00:03:16.249 --> 00:03:18.860
it is as magical as described.

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.810
That evening as they are winding down, Richard
feels that he has finally found a place where

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.359
he belongs.

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:27.340
The next day Sal explains how the community
works.

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.519
They grow their own food and build their own
houses and are almost self-sufficient.

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:35.090
They only have to sail back to civilization
once in a while to trade some "grass" for

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:36.090
rice.

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.260
It was agreed with the farmers on the other
side of the island that they would not be

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.279
bothered as long as more people did not come
to the island and their hemp was not stolen,

00:03:43.279 --> 00:03:45.139
so they grow their own.

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:49.420
The three Swedes teach them spear fishing
and Richard gets the hang of it pretty quick.

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.499
The community has a range of sporting and
leisure activities for all tastes.

00:03:53.499 --> 00:03:57.620
The only person Richard dislikes is Sal's
boyfriend Bugs, their carpenter, because he

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.889
mocks Richard for being a freeloader.

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:03.489
The community has a tradition for the last
arrived member to tattoo the next.

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:07.359
It really was paradise, but there was something
else he desired.

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:11.779
One day, as Richard is staring at Françoise,
Keaty comes up and tells him all the reasons

00:04:11.779 --> 00:04:13.670
he can never be with her.

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.310
Shortly after, one of the guys says he wants
to go to the mainland to see a dentist, but

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:18.750
Sal denies it.

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.460
Richard understands that sometimes people
have to endure a little pain to keep their

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:23.460
secret.

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.700
They pull his tooth out with pliers.

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.260
That night, Françoise invites Richard for
a walk on the beach.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.980
She confesses that she likes him alot, but
it's difficult for her to spend time with

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:34.910
him because she's with Étienne.

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:38.050
They go for a swim in the glowing water and
start making out.

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.740
They promise each other to keep it a secret.

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:45.200
Not long after, Étienne confronts Richard
about his relationship with his girlfriend.

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.980
He tries to play dumb but Étienne says everybody
already knows about it.

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:52.740
Even though he is heartbroken, he makes it
clear that he will not stand in their way,

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:56.380
because he just wants her to be happy, even
if it is with Richard.

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:58.880
On one of these days it's pouring rain.

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:03.020
Christo explains that it is difficult to catch
fish because of the poor visibility.

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:06.590
The rain can last for weeks and sometimes
they get really hungry.

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:11.460
Richard decides to try his luck, grabs Christo's
gear and swims out into the lagoon.

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:15.880
When he turns around, he sees the other members
panicking, but can't hear them.

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:20.200
He then notices a shark fin and frantically
starts to swim to shore, but the shark chases

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.610
after him.

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:25.410
The scene cuts back to the community house
and he recounts how he managed to overpower

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:26.940
the shark.

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:31.350
Everyone cheers him on, but Bugs is not impressed
because it was just a baby shark.

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:34.720
Richard puts him in his place though and they
go to sleep.

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:38.760
Sometime later, Sal informs the community
that their rice has been contaminated by a

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:43.110
fungus, which means that someone will have
to travel to mainland for a shopping trip.

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:47.210
For some reason, nobody volunteers so she
asks Richard to accompany her.

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:50.520
He seems hesitant, but he isn't really given
a choice.

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:55.660
One by one, the members give him their shopping
list, consisting mainly of snacks, batteries,

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:59.680
and hygiene items, but also a bunch of other
things they can't come by here.

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:04.590
Lastly, Bugs comes up, grabs him by the balls,
and tells him to keep his hands to himself

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:06.830
and the "little Richard" in his pants.

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:10.520
He had been looking forward to the air conditioning
and cold beer, but when they got there he

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.710
remembered all the reasons he wanted to leave
in the first place.

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:17.740
He also understood why Sal was trying so hard
to keep the beach a secret, because if they

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:20.550
didn't, it would soon turn into this.

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:23.870
After they finish their shopping, he and Sal
sit in a pub.

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:27.100
They are interrupted by the surfer dudes and
their girlfriends.

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:30.560
Richard is introduced as the man with the
map and Sal hears this.

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:34.790
The surfer group seems super excited to visit
the island, so Richard tells them that the

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:37.450
map was fake and the beach does not exist.

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:40.600
They don't believe him, thinking he's just
holding out on them.

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:43.980
This infuriates Richard, so he lashes out
at them.

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:48.830
Afterwards, Sal asks if he made them a copy
of the map, but Richard, not wanting to confess,

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:52.530
says that he only mentioned where he was going
and they only saw it once.

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:55.990
She breathes a sigh of relief, thinking they
don't have it in them to get there without

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:57.140
a map.

00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:01.220
Sal explains that she'll keep it a secret,
goes to play pool with a friend, and instructs

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:02.730
Richard to warm the bed.

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:06.110
Later, they perform some pair yoga exercises.

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:09.850
It was payment for her silence and his ticket
back to the island.

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:13.880
When they return, Richard hands out all the
orders to the grateful members.

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:18.250
He brings Françoise a disposable camera,
but she asks if anything happened on the rice

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:21.760
run, because people have been saying that
Sal is attracted to him.

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:25.570
Not wanting to spoil the moment, Richard promises
her that nothing happened and they return

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:26.750
to normal.

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:29.400
Françoise takes a picture of the group.

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:34.330
One day, while Richard is lying in a hammock
playing a game, he hears panicked screams.

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:38.590
When he goes outside, he finds that the Swedes
have suffered a shark attack.

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:42.590
One of them is missing a chunk of his leg
and has a bite wound on his torso.

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:46.750
He follows the trail to the beach and finds
Christo with a bite in his leg, gasping in

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:47.750
pain.

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:51.370
He is brought inside, where Sal offers to
take him to the hospital as long as he doesn't

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:53.080
reveal their location.

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:56.960
He begs for them to bring help here,because
he is now terrified of water and doesn't want

00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:58.650
to go anywhere near it.

00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:03.120
Sal denies his request and tells him to either
go or stay here and take his chances.

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:06.670
The members pay their respects to Christo's
friend and bury him.

00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:10.780
After the funeral, they tried going back to
normal, but Christo's constant painful cries

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:12.470
agitated the group.

00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:17.100
Richard ponders that after a major tragedy,
one should either recover or die so everyone

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:19.720
can say what a good guy you were and move
on.

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:22.990
It's the hanging around in between that really
irritates people.

00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:27.680
The group decides to take Christo to a tent
in the woods, ignoring Étienne's pleas.

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:29.890
Shortly after, the community went back to
normal.

00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:33.029
Out of sight, out of mind.

00:08:33.029 --> 00:08:36.800
Sometime later, Sal takes Richard to the other
side of the island and shows him the surfers

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:38.300
holding a map.

00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:42.009
She reiterates that the farmers told them
no more people, but now it looks like they

00:08:42.009 --> 00:08:44.050
are handing out tour guides.

00:08:44.050 --> 00:08:47.930
Sal is furious and orders him to be here every
day until they arrive to turn them away and

00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:49.220
get the map.

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:53.040
Richard points out that they could be there
for weeks, but she doesn't care.

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:55.720
That night, Françoise comes and slaps him.

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:58.279
Sal told everyone what happened on their trip.

00:08:58.279 --> 00:09:01.460
He knew it would happen, but was crushed nonetheless.

00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:04.910
As days pass, he finds new ways to entertain
himself.

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:08.790
He starts sneaking around the farmers and
observing their daily activities.

00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:10.920
He pretends to be in a video game.

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:14.330
The longer he stayed away from the community,
the less he missed them.

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:17.350
He found new players, even if they didn't
know it yet.

00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:19.350
He starts messing with the farmers.

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:23.899
The forest is his territory, the mission is
to retrieve the map, farmers are his defenders

00:09:23.899 --> 00:09:26.199
and the surfers are the invaders.

00:09:26.199 --> 00:09:30.050
He slowly starts losing his sanity and gets
visions about Daffy.

00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:33.769
One day Keaty comes to check on him and finds
him completely out of it.

00:09:33.769 --> 00:09:37.140
He tells Richard to pull himself together
because he can't keep running around in the

00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:39.230
dark, not talking to anyone.

00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:41.839
However, he does not get through to Richard.

00:09:41.839 --> 00:09:45.519
He starts making traps in the woods, still
having visions of Daffy.

00:09:45.519 --> 00:09:48.019
Daffy led the way, showed him the truth.

00:09:48.019 --> 00:09:49.850
Richard won't let him down.

00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:53.970
He starts sneaking around the farmers' homes,
touching their weapons while they sleep.

00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:56.350
He takes one of the guys' headbands.

00:09:56.350 --> 00:09:57.699
The day has come.

00:09:57.699 --> 00:10:00.990
The surfers approach on a raft and soon reach
the shore.

00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:03.100
Richard watches their every move.

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:06.639
When they reach the hemp field, they think
they're in heaven and start dancing around

00:10:06.639 --> 00:10:07.889
and singing.

00:10:07.889 --> 00:10:12.100
This attracts the attention of the guards,
who approach with weapons drawn.

00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:15.269
They notice the guards and tell them it was
a mistake coming here and they will leave

00:10:15.269 --> 00:10:16.649
immediately.

00:10:16.649 --> 00:10:19.279
When that does not work, they offer them money.

00:10:19.279 --> 00:10:23.290
The situation escalates and when a surfer
approaches one of the farmers, he pulls the

00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:24.360
trigger.

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:28.079
Panic breaks out and 2 more are shot, leaving
only 1 girl.

00:10:28.079 --> 00:10:34.769
Richard gets into position and hisses at her
as soon as she reaches the end of the field.

00:10:34.769 --> 00:10:39.670
This causes Richard to pause for a moment
and he finally seems to snap back to reality.

00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:43.160
One of the farmers runs after him, but gets
caught in the trap.

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:44.690
Richard reaches the waterfall.

00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:46.629
Oh, there goes gravity.

00:10:46.629 --> 00:10:50.260
Richard gets to the camp where they celebrate
6 years living here.

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.870
Sal makes a toast to many more years to come.

00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:56.740
As Richard lurks in the shadows, he can't
remember the person he once was and thinks

00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:59.990
he won't find him again as long as he stays
on this island.

00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:03.589
He intercepts Françoise and tries to persuade
her to leave with him.

00:11:03.589 --> 00:11:08.019
She takes him to the tent and Richard tries
to convince the 3 of them to leave, but Étienne

00:11:08.019 --> 00:11:09.639
can't leave Christo here.

00:11:09.639 --> 00:11:12.120
He has gangrene in his leg and it's spreading.

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:14.220
Meanwhile the party is going hard.

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:17.389
Richard tells them to wait for him at the
boat implying that he will "take care" of

00:11:17.389 --> 00:11:18.470
the Christo situation.

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:21.970
They run off, but the farmers intercept them.

00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:24.309
Richard puts Christo out of his misery.

00:11:24.309 --> 00:11:27.950
He suffered because they refused to let anything
spoil their fun.

00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:30.519
When Richard leaves the tent he's knocked
out.

00:11:30.519 --> 00:11:32.839
The party is interrupted by the farmers.

00:11:32.839 --> 00:11:37.389
The senior farmer explains his frustrations
about more people coming here with maps, threatening

00:11:37.389 --> 00:11:40.670
his livelihood and ability to send money to
his family.

00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:44.190
He orders them to leave the island and everyone
but Sal agrees.

00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:48.350
Richard tries to convince her, but she yells
at him to be quiet because it's all his fault

00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:49.350
anyway.

00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:53.620
The farmer realizes that he was the one sneaking
around, playing with their guns, and also

00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:55.290
leading new people here.

00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:59.300
He hands Sal a revolver with a single bullet
and gives her the option to stay if she kills

00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:00.300
Richard.

00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:01.879
Bugs pins him to the pole.

00:12:01.879 --> 00:12:04.589
Richard begs for mercy, but Sal is determined.

00:12:04.589 --> 00:12:08.339
He says that, unlike with Christo, this time
everyone will see what it takes to keep their

00:12:08.339 --> 00:12:09.790
paradise going.

00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:13.230
She says they can take it and pulls the trigger,
but it's a blank.

00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:14.959
Richard starts laughing.

00:12:14.959 --> 00:12:19.350
The senior farmer smirks as the community
crumbles and its members leave.

00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:23.110
Everyone except Sal left on a raft and went
back to their normal lives.

00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:28.380
Richard is at an internet cafe checking his
email and finds the group photo from Françoise.

00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:32.410
Paradise is not the place you go to, but a
moment in life when you feel that you belong.

00:12:32.410 --> 00:12:34.569
Once you find it, it lasts forever.

00:12:34.569 --> 00:12:35.569
The end.

00:12:35.569 --> 00:12:36.569
Thank you for watching!
