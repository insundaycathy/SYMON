00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:14.560
As Dominic Toretto is being transported to prison by bus, his sister Mia Toretto&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:20.160
and friend Brian O'Conner lead an assault on&nbsp;
the bus, freeing Dom. While the authorities&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.240
search for them, the trio escapes to Rio de&nbsp;
Janeiro. Awaiting Dom's arrival, Mia and Brian&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:32.160
join their friend Vince and other participants&nbsp;
on a job to steal three cars from a train. Brian&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.280
and Mia discover that agents from the U.S. Drug&nbsp;
Enforcement Administration (DEA) are also on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.640
train and that the cars are seized property. When&nbsp;
Dom arrives at the train with his accomplices,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:48.880
he realizes that their leader Zizi is only&nbsp;
interested in stealing one car; a Ford GT40. Dom&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:55.280
has Mia steal the car herself before he and Brian&nbsp;
fight Zizi and his henchmen, during which Zizi&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:01.120
kills the DEA agents assigned to the vehicles.&nbsp;
Dom and Brian are captured and brought to crime&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:07.600
lord Hernan Reyes, the owner of the cars and&nbsp;
Zizi's boss. Reyes orders the pair interrogated&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.640
to discover the location of the car, but they&nbsp;
manage to escape and retreat to their safehouse.&nbsp;

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.520
While Brian, Dom, and Mia examine&nbsp;
the car to discover its importance,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.080
Vince arrives and is caught trying to remove a&nbsp;
computer chip from it. He admits he was planning&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.600
to sell the chip to Reyes on his own, and Dom&nbsp;
forces him to leave. Brian investigates the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.640
chip and discovers it contains the complete&nbsp;
financial details of Reyes' criminal empire,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:40.080
including the locations of US$100 million in cash.
Diplomatic Security Service agent Luke Hobbs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:46.560
and his team arrive in Rio to arrest Dom and&nbsp;
Brian. With the help of local officer Elena Neves,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.960
they travel to Dom's safehouse, but&nbsp;
find it under assault by Reyes' men,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:58.080
searching for the chip. Brian, Dom and Mia escape.&nbsp;
Dom suggests they split up and leave Rio, but Mia&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.120
announces she is pregnant with Brian's child.&nbsp;
Dom agrees to stick together and suggests they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:08.560
steal the money from Reyes to start a new life.&nbsp;
They organize a team to perform the heist which includes Han,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:17.120
Roman, Tej, Gisele, Leo, and Santos. Vince&nbsp;
later joins the team after saving Mia from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.240
being captured by Reyes' men. Since it would be&nbsp;
difficult to steal from 10 different locations,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:27.600
Dom's team attack one of those locations and&nbsp;
burn $10 million in front of Reyes's staff.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.440
Afraid of further attacks, Reyes&nbsp;
consolidates the remaining $90 million&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.240
in a new vault inside a police station. Dom's&nbsp;team buys cars and equipment,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:41.920
and creates a plan to steal the money.
Hobbs and his team eventually find and arrest Dom,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:47.440
Mia, Brian, and Vince. While transporting them to&nbsp;
the airport for extradition to the United States,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:53.680
the convoy is attacked by Reyes' men, who kill&nbsp;
Hobbs' team. Hobbs and Elena are saved by Dom,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.240
Brian, Mia, and Vince, who escape the&nbsp;
assault, but Vince is fatally shot.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:03.760
Wanting to avenge his murdered team, Hobbs and&nbsp;
Elena agree to help with the heist. The gang break&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:09.280
into the police station and tear the vault holding&nbsp;
Reyes' money from the building using their cars,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:15.120
dragging it through the city. After an extensive&nbsp;
police chase, Dom has Brian continue on without him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.000
while he attacks the police and the pursuing&nbsp;
Reyes, using the vault attached to his car to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.080
smash their vehicles. Brian returns and kills Zizi&nbsp;
while Reyes is badly injured by Dom's assault.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:32.160
Hobbs arrives on the scene and executes Reyes.&nbsp;
Though Hobbs refuses to let Dom and Brian go free,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.880
he gives them a 24-hour head start to escape&nbsp;
on the condition that they leave the vault as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:42.320
it is. However, the vault is empty, as it had&nbsp;
been switched during the chase. After splitting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:48.800
the cash, Dom's team go their separate ways. On a&nbsp;
tropical beach, Brian challenges Dom to a final,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:54.160
no-stakes race to prove who is the better driver.
In a mid-credits scene, Hobbs is given a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:59.360
file by Monica Fuentes concerning the&nbsp;
hijack of a military convoy in Berlin,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:07.040
where he discovers a recent photo of Dom's former&nbsp;
girlfriend Letty, who had been presumed dead.
