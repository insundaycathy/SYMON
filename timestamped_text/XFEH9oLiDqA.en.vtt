00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.240
Welcome to Slash Forward. In this episode&nbsp;
we’re going to go around and around while&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.440
attempting to avoid getting our minds wrapped&nbsp;
up. But, not in a circle, in a cube you see? As&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:23.360
we take a spirited jaunt through the 1997 film&nbsp;
Cube. Imagine waking up in a strange room with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:28.560
doors on every wall. Unbeknownst to you, some of&nbsp;
those doors lead to adjacent rooms that contain&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.880
deadly traps. However, it’s not random, they&nbsp;
are identified by a complex number system. Sure,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.960
you wouldn’t be able to figure it out, but would&nbsp;
one of the other survivors you happened to stumble&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.520
across along the way? Would you have the time&nbsp;
and wherewithal to sort things out to determine&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.640
everyone’s special talents? Would those talents&nbsp;
have anything to do with why each person was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:54.560
selected and placed inside the device? Man, I’m&nbsp;
really not sure about that. But I am sure that,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:59.040
along the way, we’re going to have a few laughs&nbsp;
and, just maybe, learn a few lessons. Be sure to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.520
comment with your best idea for how to navigate&nbsp;
this labyrinthine hellscape, and hit the like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.560
button if, in the process of pondering it, you&nbsp;
learn something about yourself. Let’s get to it.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:14.640
We open, unsettlingly, on the closest close up of&nbsp;
an eyeball that’s possible with modern technology,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.400
pulling back to reveal that it belongs to a&nbsp;
man. He has awoken inside an unfamiliar chamber.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.120
Naturally curious, he spins a lever and&nbsp;
opens a door that leads to an adjacent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:30.080
compartment. Swelling with pride over this&nbsp;
discovery, he does this several times,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:35.520
choosing to finally enter one of them for reasons&nbsp;
unknown. Despite the similarities of each cube,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.560
he remains cautious. His reluctance&nbsp;
was prescient as his first and only&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.280
step forward results in his body becoming&nbsp;
conveniently cubed for efficient storage.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.000
We then cut to a couple more cubesters exploring&nbsp;
rooms and trying to make the best choices they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.480
can. With limited information they opt to&nbsp;
group up and work together to avoid traps.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.560
Before long they discover that they’re in&nbsp;
the party room where all roads converge,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.280
apparently. Momentarily safe, they gather&nbsp;
their thoughts as Rennes sacrifices future&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.480
foot comfort for the sake of&nbsp;
ruling out certain pathways.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.920
In comparing notes to try to&nbsp;
ascertain what the hell happened,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.160
they realize that they all blacked out at some&nbsp;
point and then woke up here with no further&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.200
details about where they are or why they’re here&nbsp;
available to them. Quentin, a natural leader,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.320
helps Rennes feel empowered by soliciting his&nbsp;
advice on how to proceed. His intent is to head&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:29.520
in a straight line to the end of the road, which&nbsp;
he will do with relative safety due to the boot.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.400
Quentin, a cop on the outside, gives Leaven a&nbsp;
pep talk to get her squared away and ready as the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.880
group begins booting their way along. She finds&nbsp;
some room numbers in a shaft, and hopes they’re&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.600
not sequential as that would indicate a buttload&nbsp;
of rooms and they only have a few days to survive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.880
without water. To alleviate this Rennes tells&nbsp;
Holloway to suck a button - but in a helpful way.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.200
Then a room with noticeable ozone&nbsp;
indicates the boot is not always truth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:01.120
ahhhh, and the boot has no molecules, of&nbsp;
course! Quentin then puts together that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:06.080
Rennes is the Rennes - famous professional&nbsp;
prison escapist. He’s been in the paper!&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.320
Anyway, he has the perfect skill set for&nbsp;
this type of circumstance. His first jewel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:15.440
of advice - shut the f up and focus on numero&nbsp;
uno. If they all didn’t have boots he could use,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.040
he would’ve already left them behind.&nbsp;
It’s a good thing he shared this wisdom,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.760
because he then demonstrates the consequence of&nbsp;
taking things too easy when he gets blasted in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.720
the face. And, when they see him again, he&nbsp;
is in extreme distress as his head has been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.680
reformed into a little soup bowl that holds&nbsp;
the bubbling, foamy remains of his face.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.680
But, if this is his fate, the pro, what of&nbsp;
the rest of them, they wonder? Then they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.040
also get caught up in trying to figure&nbsp;
out the reason they were chosen for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:46.080
whatever this is. Leaven and Worth claim to&nbsp;
be a couple of boring normies. And Holloway,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:51.280
the doctor, criticizes Worth for being a porn&nbsp;
dog while Quentin puzzles over why Leaven the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.080
student was allowed to keep her glasses. Since&nbsp;
there’s no such thing as a coincidence Leaven&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.560
is encouraged to put her academics to the&nbsp;
test and she quickly recognizes trap rooms&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.960
are marked by prime numbers. She can confirm&nbsp;
this because she remembers all of the prior&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:09.680
numbers from the rooms she’s passed through.&nbsp;
Yep, just a typical math student from the local&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:15.120
university. The boot confirms what the brain has&nbsp;
derived, and Leaven begins to find her voice.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.840
Now they progress quickly, carried through by&nbsp;
her infallible numerology, making their way&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.240
through - but to where? They eventually take&nbsp;
a break for some casual chit chat at which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:35.040
point Quentin shares that he has three kids I’m&nbsp;
sorry to hear that what is this conversation!?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:40.240
Soon after they hit the end of the road - a room&nbsp;
with all adjacent prime numbers and only one door&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:45.920
unchecked. Quentin climbs up to scope it out, but&nbsp;
finds it already occupied by Kazan. His arrival&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:51.600
now requires them to move a little more slowly&nbsp;
to accommodate his anxiety and color preferences.

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.120
As they move through, they&nbsp;
ponder who the mastermind may be.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:59.040
Quentin suggests some sort of rich&nbsp;
psychopath, but Holloway finds this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.880
laughable. But her hubris is quickly&nbsp;
punished when she jumps down and chokes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:07.280
on her button - great, now she has to&nbsp;
wait until it passes to suck it again.

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.760
With each new room blending with the last, they&nbsp;
get a bit too casual and Quentin finds himself&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:16.640
inside a razor wire contraption. He manages&nbsp;
to dive out with only a partial leg shave,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:20.800
but they also recognize that they can no&nbsp;
longer trust the prime number hypothesis.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.480
Quentin has a sneaking suspicion&nbsp;
that Worth knew the trap was there,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:28.960
but he lets it go and when they all regroup&nbsp;
they take a rest so Leaven can try to work&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:33.840
things out. Unfortunately, this experience has&nbsp;
turned her from a meek churchmouse into a bossy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:39.280
little knowitall who complains about everything -&nbsp;
like when Kazan starts peeing inside their room.

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:42.720
When Worth starts up again with his&nbsp;
nihilism, Quentin has another go at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:47.120
him. He expresses his utter disdain and&nbsp;
suggests that, if nothing means anything,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:52.160
why doesn’t he just go jump in a cube? Which,&nbsp;
of course, he does not. Quentin riles him up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:56.400
enough to cause him to slip up and reveal that&nbsp;
he has some knowledge of this place. Although,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:00.320
he contends that he was only contracted&nbsp;
to design the outer candy shell. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:05.200
knows nothing specific, because they were all&nbsp;
compartmentalized and only worked on one piece.

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:08.800
This sounds a lot like governmental&nbsp;
conspiracy, so Holloway gets jacked&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:12.160
up at the thought of being correct in her&nbsp;
assessment. But Worth suggests that it was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:17.120
just a thing that came together with no grand&nbsp;
purpose and no real intention - somehow. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:21.280
that it’s being used only to demonstrate&nbsp;
that it’s not pointless. Their presence is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:27.120
a manifestation of the out-of-control nature of&nbsp;
humanity, or something. If it’s any consolation,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:31.200
Worth does find catharsis in the&nbsp;
admission and subsequent beating.

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:35.600
Leaven does, at least, get the outer dimensions&nbsp;
of the cube. After walking off their room,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:39.040
she figures the whole thing’s got&nbsp;
twenty six cubes in any direction&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:46.800
She then realizes that the numbers are&nbsp;
Cartesian coordinates. But, if that’s true,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:50.880
she started in a room that should have been&nbsp;
outside the cube. But at least they have a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:56.080
general idea how far along they are. Although,&nbsp;
there is still the ever present danger of traps.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:00.000
Unwilling to backtrack after coming this&nbsp;
far, and working out that the next room&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.400
is set off by noise, Quentin insists on&nbsp;
traversing it with Worth taking the lead.

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:09.040
They then begin the process of slowly&nbsp;
and quietly descending into the blue box.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:13.600
Worth lucks out in that the first room he checks&nbsp;
passes the boot test, so they’re all lowered in.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:17.440
Kazan puts it on hard mode as he comes&nbsp;
down on the opposite side of the room,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:21.600
and then also doesn’t watch his step very well.&nbsp;
Luckily they are able to turn the crank to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:26.720
release him. Quentin comes down last at the exact&nbsp;
moment that the lower door makes its final turn&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:31.600
on its own, but this doesn’t set off the trap.&nbsp;
However, when Kazan expresses his excitement,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:35.840
it does give Quentin the chance to look&nbsp;
like a total badass for the second time.

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:39.440
Now that he’s all geared up, he and Holloway&nbsp;
have it out over the differences between&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:43.920
progressive ideals and authoritarianism,&nbsp;
resulting in a complete loss of control that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:48.320
degrades his trustworthiness as a leader.&nbsp;
Once that nasty business is wrapped up,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:51.760
Worth opens the next door to reveal&nbsp;
the darkness of the outer shell.

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:55.440
With nothing out there and nothing to hold&nbsp;
onto, Quentin suggests they swing around&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:59.840
in the dark to see if they can find a way down.&nbsp;
Given the weight limit of their makeshift rope,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:03.920
Holloway volunteers to be the test&nbsp;
subject. She only gets about one box down,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:07.920
and the rest of them aren’t really able to hold&nbsp;
her when she attempts to swing. What’s more,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:11.040
when a nearby rumble shakes them,&nbsp;
the gang loses their grip on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:15.520
rope. Quentin manages to hold on, but when&nbsp;
she reaches him he gets that look in his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:19.520
eyes and lets her go, which is exacerbated&nbsp;
by the sudden disappearance of the rope.

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:23.920
Now down to the four of them, they agree to take&nbsp;
a refreshing nap to recharge their batteries.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:28.240
But basically as soon as they all hit REM&nbsp;
sleep, he steals Leaven to the next room&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:32.400
and tries to convince her that they are the&nbsp;
keys to getting out and the others are traps.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:37.360
But his similes take on an uncomfortably&nbsp;
sexual air. Then the others arrive, but they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:43.120
seem standoffish for some reason and no matter how&nbsp;
hard Quentin hits them, they don’t warm up to him.

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:48.800
Then he uses worthless Worth as a trap tester,&nbsp;
which is flippin hilarious. After all that effort,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:53.200
they’ve managed to arrive back with the old&nbsp;
Rennester. Then they all allow themselves at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:57.280
least a brief moment of coming unglued. But&nbsp;
then Worth gets the idea to check the room&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:01.680
that killed Rennes and finds an empty void.&nbsp;
This indicates that it’s not them circling,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:05.680
but that the rumbling they’ve been hearing&nbsp;
are the cubes themselves changing positions.

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:10.160
It then dawns on Leaven that she should’ve been&nbsp;
using all the numbers, not just the first one.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:14.800
The additional digits indicate permutations&nbsp;
of movement and cycles. When she remembers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:18.640
the cube that seemed to have the impossible&nbsp;
coordinate, she posits that if they can get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:23.520
back to that cube,when it returns to its original&nbsp;
position they will be outside the cube at large.

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:27.600
So Leaven gets to computing in an attempt to&nbsp;
solve the puzzle. After figuring their room,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:32.240
she asks for numbers from all the others to use&nbsp;
as reference points. Based on this information,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:36.240
she identifies that there are two cycles left&nbsp;
before they would be stuck waiting for the whole&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:41.040
thing to start over again. In other good news, she&nbsp;
now recognizes that trap rooms are identified not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:46.240
by prime numbers, but by numbers that are a power&nbsp;
of a prime. The bad news is that she can’t compute&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:52.400
these astronomical numbers. But they discover&nbsp;
that Kazan can, so at his request Worth offers him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:52.400 --> 00:10:00.000
all the gumdrops he can cram in his piehole if he&nbsp;
just gets them out of there that’s not the point!

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.800
They confirm the next room is safe, but not if&nbsp;
it’s the correct room, but they go in anyway.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:08.960
They begin moving quickly and Worth makes an&nbsp;
attempt to free them of the hassle of Quentin’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:13.840
volatile paranoia by dropping him into a cube.&nbsp;
Then they really get going until eventually,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:18.720
and apparently through pure luck, they find their&nbsp;
original cube. Indicating, of course, that if they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:23.200
had worked things out to begin with, they didn’t&nbsp;
have to move at all. They are waylaid when Kazan&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:28.240
fails to cross over in time. His screams indicate&nbsp;
he is not far, so Worth goes to retrieve him as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:32.480
Leaven confirms their location and reveals that&nbsp;
the next room should take them to the bridge.

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:37.360
They all pile in and get yeeted into oblivion.&nbsp;
After the final move they transfer into what they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:41.760
presume to be the bridge. Sure enough, when they&nbsp;
open the door, they’re greeted by the blinding&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:46.880
white light of heaven. But Worth isn’t feeling&nbsp;
so great, he’s morose and decides that there’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:50.960
not really anything out there waiting for him&nbsp;
to give his life meaning. This works out well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:55.680
as Quentin appears and shares his new philosophy&nbsp;
that freedom is only for the strong, and he starts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:55.680 --> 00:11:00.080
getting stabby. But after he drops his implement&nbsp;
and attempts to leave, Worth catches him by the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:05.120
heel and holds on just long enough for the rooms&nbsp;
to start back up again, converting Quentin into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:11.200
a humble wall smear. Then Worth lays down and&nbsp;
dies as Kazan wanders off in search of gumdrops.

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:15.440
Cube is a very interesting and unique premise for&nbsp;
a horror film. And I think they did a really good&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:19.440
job of putting this together and making it&nbsp;
look so good despite the small budget. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:23.360
acting was a bit stage theater at times,&nbsp;
but I think the primary shortfalls of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:27.600
movie arose from the attempt to cram so&nbsp;
much story into the standard timeframe. It&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:32.160
required them to move along at a fairly high&nbsp;
pace and left a lot of questions in my mind.

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:36.080
I enjoyed the idea that they don’t know why&nbsp;
they’re in the cube or who was responsible&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:40.800
for it. I don’t think that needs to be explained.&nbsp;
But then, in that vein, they probably didn’t need&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:45.280
to spend as much time talking about it. It would&nbsp;
have been better to use that time to explain or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:49.120
show the characters setting some establishing&nbsp;
rules to help bring the movie together.

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:54.000
For instance, they seemed to move in and out of&nbsp;
rooms fairly directly. They didn’t check every&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.720
door each time or really discuss what direction&nbsp;
they were going or why. If they set that up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:02.560
at the beginning so we know it’s part of their&nbsp;
method, it wouldn’t need to be shown each time.

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:09.440
Also, in regards to the movement, it was&nbsp;
interesting to have different methodologies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:14.400
for identifying safe and unsafe rooms. However,&nbsp;
the way they went about revealing those changes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:18.000
made it seem like the success they had&nbsp;
experienced from their prior methods were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:23.040
basically the result of sheer luck. If you know&nbsp;
the numbers mean something, why not spend more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:27.920
time sorting out what they mean? Also, if they’re&nbsp;
meaningful, why would you ever assume that only&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:32.320
one of the three sequences is useful? If you’re&nbsp;
wrong about how the trap rooms are identified,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:35.440
how the hell did you make it so far&nbsp;
without finding that out the hard way?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:38.560
Maybe it has something to do with the&nbsp;
relationship between prime numbers and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:43.200
factors of prime numbers that they essentially&nbsp;
worked the same, but I’m not mathematically&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:47.760
literate enough to be able to confirm that. And&nbsp;
they didn’t make it seem like that was the case.

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:51.360
In addition, it seemed odd, given the&nbsp;
limited time they had, that they weren’t&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:55.120
proceeding under a general principle to&nbsp;
guide them and streamline decision making.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:58.000
Rennes indicated he was going in&nbsp;
a straight line to the end. But,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.160
after what they sorted out later about the&nbsp;
size and quantity of the cubes, it seems like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:06.720
it would make sense to adopt a rule like go down&nbsp;
every time you have the opportunity to go down.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:11.120
We do learn that this wouldn’t have gotten them&nbsp;
out, but they didn’t know that until much later.

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:22.400
Aside from that, the only other real&nbsp;
criticism I would have comes from the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:26.400
weird continuity errors they introduced&nbsp;
into the film. There are characters who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:29.680
should have seen each other at certain&nbsp;
times, but didn’t. Or Quentin showing up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:34.000
out of nowhere at the end - how did he find them&nbsp;
let alone enter the room without being noticed?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.160
There are a few things like this throughout,&nbsp;
but I think these are minor gaffes overall,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:41.920
because the way the story is presented is&nbsp;
interesting enough that some of these elements,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:46.000
likely added for stylistic or dramatic&nbsp;
purposes, are easily overlooked.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:14:02.320
Before we go, I’d like to give a huge thanks to&nbsp;
my donors, memorialized in the hall of headshots.

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:05.440
I have a website set up where you can&nbsp;
support the channel through donations or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:09.840
merch. Any donation unlocks uncensored movie&nbsp;
reviews of Lifeforce and Under the Skin,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:13.680
with others to be added over&nbsp;
time. If you enjoyed the video,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:18.640
I’d love for you to become a part of the&nbsp;
channel by subscribing. Thanks for watching.
