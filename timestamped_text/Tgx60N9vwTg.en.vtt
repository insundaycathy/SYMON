00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.760
What is up YouTube, it's your&nbsp;
girl Evelyn and as you know&nbsp;

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:07.840
we are fast approaching
The L Word: Gen Q season 2 premiere.&nbsp;

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.440
So I thought what better time&nbsp;
for a season one refresher and

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.600
I'm getting a little help from my&nbsp;
friend and L Word guru, Ash Silver.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.960
Ash has the most in-depth&nbsp;
L Word channel on YouTube

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.280
and she'll be covering the&nbsp;
other half of this video.&nbsp;

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:22.960
So make sure to check her channel out.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.640
She's sweet.
She's British&nbsp;

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.240
And she's got all the L Word dirt.&nbsp;

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.200
So without further ado here is everything&nbsp;
you need to know before season two!

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.760
*Paris by The Chainsmokers playing*

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.240
I'm kicking things off with my favorite&nbsp;
storyline and the one I'm most excited for.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.880
The Dani-Finley-Sophie love triangle.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.080
Dani is an emotionally unavailable, rich girl with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:51.680
daddy issues. And Sophie is an emotionally&nbsp;
available, not rich girl with daddy issues.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:52.480
So naturally...

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:58.800
"I love you and and I really think we should&nbsp;
do this. I just want to be your wife."

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.920
Despite being complete opposites, having&nbsp;
almost no chemistry and spending all of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.800
season one in a perpetual fight, Sophie&nbsp;
and Dani are committed to making it work.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.320
"I'm inviting my whole family&nbsp;
to the engagement party. Aunts,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.040
uncles, cousins, second cousins... I&nbsp;
mean you know it's last minute so."

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.600
Sophie works as a producer on Alice's TV show&nbsp;
and Dani is a morally conflicted PR executive.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.400
And for more on Dani make&nbsp;
sure to check out Ash's video.&nbsp;

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.600
She goes into detail about&nbsp;
Dani's work and Bette and...

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:30.640
THAT SITUATION

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:31.120
"What's wrong?"

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.920
"I'm fine. It's - it's fine.&nbsp;
It's, um, it's not professional."

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.520
"I think we've moved far&nbsp;
beyond that point by now."

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.200
Enter Finley.&nbsp;

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.880
Sophie's adorkable fun-loving&nbsp;
and laid-back best friend.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.320
"Whoa, slow down bro."

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:55.280
"Why? It's free."

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.960
Honestly, the two of them have one of the most&nbsp;
loving and supportive friendships on the show.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.120
"It's funny. That's very, very funny, thank you."

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.280
"Oh, you got some baggage bro."

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.840
"Yeah dude no shit."

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.880
"All right, come on. I'll protect you."

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.840
Finley spends half of season one&nbsp;
courting gay lady minister Rebecca.&nbsp;

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.040
And the other half of season one sabotaging her&nbsp;
relationship with gay lady minister Rebecca.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.440
"Okay, so remember this morning when you were&nbsp;
wondering if I could get over the whole priest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.480
thing?"
 
"Yeah."

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.640
"Oh, I can. Because you're not a real priest."

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.480
It's strongly insinuated&nbsp;
that Finley has a mysterious&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.960
traumatic backstory that involves religion.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.600
And i don't know about you&nbsp;
but I get a little nervous&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.840
whenever a character on this show&nbsp;
has a mysterious traumatic backstory.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.640
As Dani and Sophie's relationship&nbsp;
continues to deteriorate,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.040
Sophie and Finley's bond continues to deepen,

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.840
And when Sophie has a family emergency&nbsp;
it's Finley and not Dani who steps up.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.560
Which in turn leads Sophie to pucker up.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.040
Sophie and Finley eventually sleep together&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.280
and the whole thing culminates with Sophie&nbsp;
being torn between flying to Hawaii and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.760
eloping with Dani or flying to Missouri&nbsp;
with Finley to visit her estranged family.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.080
*Heartless by The Weeknd playing*

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.000
Everyone's favorite L Word&nbsp;
heartthrob is back on her BS

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.480
but also not back on her BS?

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.640
When we first meet Shane she's heartbroken...

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.120
*That weird Ferris Bueller music playing*

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.360
Well, mostly heartbroken over her&nbsp;
estranged pop star wife Quiara.&nbsp;

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.960
To distract herself from her&nbsp;
heartbreak, Shane buys a crappy bar,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:37.280
renames it Dana's and turns it into&nbsp;
Generation Q's version of 'The Planet.'

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.080
She also sleeps with someone's&nbsp;
girlfriend in the process.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:45.840
Eventually, we meet this estranged wife and&nbsp;
suddenly all of Shane's pining makes sense.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.720
"Ohhhhh okay okay." (meaning: Shane's wife is HOT)

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.120
Turns out Shane and Quiara broke up because&nbsp;
Quiara wants children and Shane doesn't.&nbsp;

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.400
But they got married anyway.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.400
Quiara's back because she wants to work&nbsp;
things out with Shane and she's also pregnant.&nbsp;

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.640
But it's cool because Quiara will take care&nbsp;
of all those pesky parenting duties and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.760
Shane can just take care of Quiara.
And Shane goes for it because....

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.600
*She Bad by Cardi B &amp; YG playing*

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:16.560
Long story short, Quiara has a&nbsp;
miscarriage and Shane is low-key grateful.

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.480
"I didn't want this but you showed up pregnant&nbsp;
anyway. So what was I supposed to do?"

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.400
"You could have been honest from the beginning."

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:23.680
"I was honest with you."

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.200
Quiara dumps her and Shane picks up a stray dog,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.880
which I assume will teach her&nbsp;
about love and responsibility&nbsp;

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.400
As if she didn't raise her whole&nbsp;
ass brother in the original series

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.960
...but okay.

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.280
*Work by Charlotte Day Wilson playing*

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.840
Remember how Shane slept&nbsp;
with someone's girlfriend?&nbsp;

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.920
Well that someone was Tess, a&nbsp;
bartender at the bar Shane purchased.&nbsp;

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.160
Tess is a former alcoholic party girl,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.640
although I can't think of a worse profession&nbsp;
for an alcoholic than being a bartender.

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:54.160
"Which is why I'm sober now."

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:56.240
"Oh, shit."

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.200
"Yep, two years."

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.680
"Cool."

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:02.640
"Yeah, I wanted to start remembering&nbsp;
stuff. I wanted to feel again."

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.760
And surprise surprise, she has a relapse.

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:11.040
Tess's storyline is fascinating because it&nbsp;
seems to be more about self-actualization,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.400
forgiveness and healing.

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.440
Which is different for The L&nbsp;
Word but kind of refreshing.&nbsp;

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:19.760
Also, she and Finley have sex but it&nbsp;
doesn't seem to affect anything whatsoever.&nbsp;

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.560
And despite the fact that Shane&nbsp;
slept with her girlfriend,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:27.040
Tess has become Shane's unofficial&nbsp;
therapist which can only mean one thing...

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:30.960
*Damage by H.E.R. playing*

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:35.040
Last up is Micah who has the most&nbsp;
detached storyline of everyone.

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:38.400
And not because he's a guy but&nbsp;
because his storyline literally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.200
doesn't intersect with anyone else's storyline.

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.320
Although in the season 2 trailer&nbsp;
it looks like he might be dating&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:48.560
Maribel which i think would be a great&nbsp;
way to better weave him into the show.

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:54.080
Anyway, Micah dated Dani before he transitioned&nbsp;
and he lives with Dani and Sophie now because...

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.160
Once a lesbian always a lesbian.

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.360
His storyline revolves around&nbsp;
his relationship with Jose,&nbsp;

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.000
a hot artist who seems like the perfect catch.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.080
Jose is sensitive to Micah's needs.

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.720
He drops the L word after like a week of dating,

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.720
and he has a husband.

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:12.720
"ohhhh okay okay."

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:17.200
I'm guessing Jose is gonna have a&nbsp;
little explaining to do in season two.

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:19.040
And if you want to catch up with Tibette&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:22.400
along with Alice and her throuple,&nbsp;
make sure to check out Ash's video.

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.200
And while you're at it give her a&nbsp;
follow across her social medias.

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:29.520
And don't forget to check out my channel&nbsp;
update video over on the community tab for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.280
all kinds of fun announcements.

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:36.640
That is it for me, I want to give a quick&nbsp;
shout out to my newest patrons Jenn and Nicole.

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:39.920
*You'll Be In My Heart by Phil Collins playing*

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:43.680
As always thank you so much for watching&nbsp;
and I'll see you in the next one.
