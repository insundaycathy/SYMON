00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:06.880
Hello there Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to another episode of Cinema Summary.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.880
I'm your underpaid host.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.200
Anyway, this isn't going on my resume.

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.960
Today we'll be looking at the classic 2001 animated CGI film "Shrek".

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:22.840
Starring: Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz [meow~], and John Litgow.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.720
Shrek, a green ogre who loves the solitude
in his swamp, finds his life interrupted when

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.949
countless fairytale characters are exiled
there by the fairytale-hating Lord Farquaad

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:34.180
of Duloc C- can he do that legally?.

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.410
Angry, Shrek decides to ask Farquaad to exile
them elsewhere.

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.700
He brings along a talking Donkey, who is the
only fairytale creature willing to guide him

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.160
to Duloc oh Eddie Murphy, I’ve missed you.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.450
Meanwhile, Farquaad tortures the Gingerbread
Man for the location of the remaining fairytale

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.290
creatures you monster! *pa-tooie*.

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:55.940
His guards rush in with something he has been
searching for: the Magic Mirror.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:01.050
He asks The Mirror if his kingdom is the fairest
of them all but is told that he is not even

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:01.740
a king.

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.840
Ha! Awkward...

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:09.000
To be a king he must marry a princess, so
Farquaad resolves to marry Princess Fiona,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.920
who is locked in a castle tower guarded by
a dragon.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.390
He organizes a tournament wherein the winner
gets the "privilege" of rescuing Fiona for

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:22.030
him.

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.980
Shrek and Donkey arrive during the tournament,
and ignorantly defeat Farquaad's knights

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:29.080
OH MY GOD! HE GOT HIM WITH THE CHAIR.

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.920
BY GOD THAT MAN HAD A FAMILY!

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.540
Farquaad proclaims them the champions, and
compels them under the threat of death to rescue

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:41.740
Fiona, promising to move the fairytale creatures
from Shrek's swamp if he succeeds.

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:48.140
Shrek and Donkey travel to the castle and
split up to find Fiona like Zoinks!.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.300
They are noticed by the dragon, who corners Donkey.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.820
In desperation he sweet-talks the dragon, learning that it is female.

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.960
Dragon falls in love with Donkey and carries
him to her chambers

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.470
Bow-Chicka-Bow-wow.

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.380
Shrek finds Fiona, who is appalled at his
lack of romanticism

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.800
and surprised that he hasn't slain Dragon.

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.180
As they leave, Shrek saves Donkey from Dragon,
who is heartbroken as a result

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.800
At first, Fiona is thrilled to be rescued
but is quickly disappointed when Shrek reveals that

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.010
he is an ogre.

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.141
She demands that Farquaad come to get her
himself, but Shrek forcibly carries her with him

00:02:21.141 --> 00:02:24.360
You’re coming with me princess.

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.990
The three have several adventures on their
way to Duloc, such as an encounter with Robin

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.300
Hood wherein Fiona reveals that she is an
expert martial artist

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.080
Oh look! A Matrix reference

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.440
Shrek and Fiona find they have a lot in common
and fall in love.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.620
However, Fiona persistently insists on sleeping
alone at night.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.400
One night, when the trio is almost at Duloc,
Fiona shelters in a windmill.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:51.060
Donkey hears strange noises from within and
investigates, finding Fiona transformed into

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.320
an ogre

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.840
Le Gasp!.

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:56.650
She explains that she was cursed during childhood
to transform every night, which is why she

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.550
was locked away, and that only her true love's
kiss will return her to her "love's true form"

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:03.520
that’s messed up.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.349
Meanwhile Shrek, about to confess his feelings
for Fiona, partly overhears them, and is heartbroken

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:12.190
as he mistakes her disgust with her transformation
to an "ugly beast" as disgust with him

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.080
Don't you just hate it when people, just don't communicate?

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.680
At Donkey's suggestion, Fiona vows to tell
Shrek about her curse, but dawn breaks before

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.900
she can, and she turns back into a human.

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.610
She finds that Shrek has brought Lord Farquaad
to the windmill during the night.

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.629
Fiona accepts Farquaad's proposal, requesting
that they be married before night falls.

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:32.640
The couple returns to Duloc, while a hurt and
angry Shrek abandons Donkey and returns to

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:33.640
his now-vacated swamp

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:39.319
Furious at Shrek, Donkey goes to the swamp
where Shrek says he overheard Donkey and Fiona's

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:40.319
conversation.

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:43.750
Donkey tells Shrek that she was talking about
someone else, and urges Shrek to talk to Fiona

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.060
before she is married.

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.440
They travel to Duloc quickly, thanks to Dragon,
who had escaped her confines and followed

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:49.440
Donkey.

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.659
Shrek interrupts the wedding before Farquaad
can kiss Fiona.

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:55.959
He tells her that Farquaad is not her true
love and is only marrying her to become king

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.860
Is that how it works?

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:58.360
Huh.

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:02.300
Oh, look! The Ogre wants to marry the princess!

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:05.180
That's my Lord Farquaad impression, ladies and gentlemen. Ain't it great?

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.160
The sun sets, which turns Fiona into an ogre
in front of everyone in the church, causing

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:14.080
Outraged, Farquaad orders Shrek executed and
Fiona detained

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.700
Dragon bursts in alongside Donkey and devours
Farquaad

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:21.800
Shrek and Fiona profess their love and share
a kiss; Fiona is bathed in light as her curse

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:26.670
is broken but is surprised that she is still
an ogre, as she thought she would become beautiful,

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:30.700
to which Shrek replies that she is still beautiful

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.440
I’m not crying but I am sweating from my eyes

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.360
They marry in the swamp and leave on their
honeymoon while Donkey and the fairytale creatures

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.440
celebrate by singing "I'm a Believer".

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:53.440
[Singing "I'm a Believer"~]
