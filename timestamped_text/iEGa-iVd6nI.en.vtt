00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:06.080
Welcome back to Movie Recaps. Today I will show&nbsp;
you a drama, crime, and action film from 1994,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.320
entitled Léon: The Professional.
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.040
A tracking shot takes us to Little Italy&nbsp;
in New York and inside a restaurant. Tony&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.920
tasks Léon to convince the fat man that moving&nbsp;
into Maurizio's territory isn't a good idea.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.440
Léon takes the task. On the day, the fat man&nbsp;
enters his hotel with a massive security detail.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:30.080
He's there to see his girl and do some business.&nbsp;
Léon arrives at the reception. The man gets a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.560
call from Tonto, telling him that a serious man&nbsp;
is coming up to talk to him. He alerts his men&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.720
about the incoming company. They wait in front&nbsp;
of the elevator and the moment somebody appears,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.680
they start shooting. The body was Tonto. The&nbsp;
rest of the men scatter, to get the car ready&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.640
and search for the assassin. As the main bodyguard&nbsp;
looks over the stairwell, Léon grabs him and pulls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.040
him over. The others are packing up the drugs&nbsp;
and money, getting ready to run out of there.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.000
Léon keeps picking the bodyguards off and blocks&nbsp;
both the exits. He traps the fat man in the room&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.800
and kills off the rest of his detail. Then peeks&nbsp;
through a bullet hole, prompting the man to fire.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:08.000
The man grabs more guns and a telephone to call&nbsp;
911. He says somebody is trying to kill him and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.880
hides until they connect him to an officer. Léon&nbsp;
shows up behind him and he hangs up. He tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.280
Léon to take the drugs and let him live, but he&nbsp;
just shows him a number and tells him to call it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.960
Maurizio greets him from the other side of the&nbsp;
line and tells him that they'll never see him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.320
back in town again. He asks for Léon, then tells&nbsp;
him to make sure he understands and let him go.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.120
Léon tells him to say that he understands and&nbsp;
disappears into the darkness. Later, Léon gets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:35.360
his usual milk from the neighborhood store and&nbsp;
walks into his building. Mathilda is sitting on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.920
the stairs and sees him walking up, then greets&nbsp;
him. Léon can tell that someone beat her up,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.800
but she lies about how it happened. She tells him&nbsp;
not to tell her dad about the cigarette. Suddenly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.120
someone walks out of her apartment and argues&nbsp;
with her father about the drugs he holds for them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:53.440
Malky tells him that he has to be honest about&nbsp;
the drugs so he doesn't have to disturb his boss.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.680
However, Mathilda's father sticks to his story&nbsp;
so Malky tells his boss that he wouldn't admit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.160
to cutting the drugs. Stan turns around and&nbsp;
sniffs the father, saying that he believes him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.640
but that he has to find out who did by tomorrow at&nbsp;
noon. They leave and the father yells after them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.840
that they should find out themselves, then slaps&nbsp;
Mathilda around. Léon overhears the whole thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.200
He showers, drinks his milk, irons his shirts, and&nbsp;
most importantly takes care of his plant. As night&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.160
falls, Léon sits down in his chair and sleeps.
The next day, Mathilda's family is going through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.280
their morning routine. We see her dad,&nbsp;
mom, older sister, and little brother.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.400
Léon is doing his morning exercise. The dad tells&nbsp;
her mom that he thinks he screwed up this time.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.960
Mathilda changes the TV station and her sister&nbsp;
chases after her, slapping her around when she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:41.760
gets to her. The phone rings and the girl answers.&nbsp;
It's Mathilda's school calling to tell her parents&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.840
that she's skipped school for two weeks and if&nbsp;
they don't explain why she'll get kicked out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.560
Mathilda says that she's dead. Léon puts his&nbsp;
plant in the sunlight and leaves his apartment,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.400
overhearing the mess at Mathilda's. He&nbsp;
watches "Singing in the Rain" in the cinema,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.800
enjoying every second. When he gets back home&nbsp;
he finds Mathilda on the stairs with a bloody&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.120
nose and tells her that life is always hard. She&nbsp;
asks him if she should get him some milk from the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.640
store. Back at his apartment, he grabs a glass&nbsp;
and some milk. Simultaneously, armed men walk&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.960
into the building, followed by Stan. He takes&nbsp;
some sort of drug and says he likes the calm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:17.520
little moments before the storm. Mathilda's dad is&nbsp;
waiting for them to arrive as they said they would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:22.560
and Léon sees them in the hallway. Stan shoots his&nbsp;
way into the apartment and his men go after him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.560
He kills the mother first, then kills the&nbsp;
older daughter and ransacks the place.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.200
His men are scared of him too. Stan finally gets&nbsp;
to the father and tells him it's one minute past&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.720
noon. Malky and the rest come inside and he tells&nbsp;
them to toss the apartment. Meanwhile, Mathilda is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.440
in the store getting groceries. Stan toys with the&nbsp;
dad while the little boy hides under the bed. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.680
men are going through the apartment and Stan steps&nbsp;
aside for a moment, just long enough for the dad&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.240
to reach for the gun and start shooting. One of&nbsp;
Stan's men freaks out and shoots the whole place,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:55.600
killing the boy. The dad runs but Stan still gets&nbsp;
him. When he sees that he got blood on his suit,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:00.240
he follows him and empties an entire clip in him.&nbsp;
The man waiting outside gets nervous as he hears&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:05.360
the shooting and Malky stops Stan from shooting&nbsp;
anymore. Malky steps outside and almost gets shot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.920
by the other guy Benny. Mathilda walks back into&nbsp;
the building and immediately realizes something&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.840
is happening. She sees that her dad is dead and&nbsp;
hears Malky say that they killed her brother.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.480
She rings Léon's doorbell begging him to let&nbsp;
her in, while one of Stan's men watches her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:23.600
struggle in front of the door. Léon hesitates but&nbsp;
eventually opens his door for her. She goes into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:28.320
the kitchen and he stays by the door. Malky sees&nbsp;
that Mathilda is missing and they look for her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:33.360
The man by the door remembers Mathilda and comes&nbsp;
to Léon's door. He follows him with his gun, when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:38.400
she turns on the TV, scaring both of them. They&nbsp;
find the drugs as the rest of the cops arrive.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:43.040
Stan tells his man to tell them that they were&nbsp;
doing their job. Léon expresses his condolences to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:47.360
Mathilda about her family, but she tells him that&nbsp;
they were all terrible, except her little brother,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:51.920
who she loved very much. He gets a pig oven glove&nbsp;
from the kitchen and tries to cheer Mathilda up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:57.280
in a childish way. Léon asks if she has anywhere&nbsp;
else to go and she says no. He gets some more milk&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.920
when Mathilda opens his case and finds his guns.&nbsp;
When he comes back she asks if he's a cleaner,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:07.200
a hit-man. He says yeah. Later, Mathilda asks&nbsp;
how much it would take to hire him to kill the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:11.440
men that killed her brother, and when she hears&nbsp;
the price, she offers him a deal - in exchange&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:16.000
for working for him he'll teach her how to become&nbsp;
a cleaner. Léon says no, but she tells him that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.040
she has nowhere else to go. Instead of arguing,&nbsp;
he tells her to rest and they'll talk tomorrow.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:25.520
He tucks her into bed and she tells him that he's&nbsp;
been very good to her. In the middle of the night,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:30.480
Léon decides to kill the girl. When he&nbsp;
reaches the bed, however, he changes his mind.&nbsp;

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:34.400
The following morning Léon puts his plant&nbsp;
in the sunlight and does his exercise.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:38.960
He hears Mathilda get up and tells her that after&nbsp;
breakfast she needs to leave. Mathilda hands him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:43.280
a note only realizes that he can't read. It&nbsp;
says that she's decided what to do with her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:49.120
life. Mathilda wants to be a cleaner. Léon gives&nbsp;
her a gun as his goodbye gift. He works alone!&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:52.240
Mathilda tries to convince him by&nbsp;
saying that since he saved her life,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.560
he's responsible for it. Léon tells Mathilda&nbsp;
that she's just a little girl and that she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:00.880
won't be able to do it. Mathilda takes the gun and&nbsp;
shoots out of the window as proof that she can.&nbsp;

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:06.240
Later, Léon and Mathilda are seen walking down&nbsp;
the street. He stops and tells her never to do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:11.280
that again because it's unprofessional. They get&nbsp;
to a hotel. The receptionist asks if they plan&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:15.600
to play the violin there, so Mathilda lies&nbsp;
and charms him into saying that it's fine.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:20.160
He gives them some forms to fill out and Mathilda&nbsp;
grabs them, saying she'll do that so Léon doesn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:25.120
feel ashamed. Léon leaves the plant downstairs&nbsp;
and joins her in the room. He goes through it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:29.520
checking it out thoroughly, then sits down&nbsp;
as Mathilda finishes with the documentation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:33.200
She pleads with him again to teach her&nbsp;
how to be a cleaner. Sometime later,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:38.240
Léon goes to talk to Tony. He asked him to get a&nbsp;
gun meant for beginners and Tony can't believe it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:43.600
Léon tells him he needs it to practice. Later, he&nbsp;
opens the box with a rifle in front of Mathilda.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:47.360
He says that the rifle is the first weapon she&nbsp;
needs to learn because it will let her keep her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:51.680
distance from the client. The closer she gets&nbsp;
to becoming a pro, the closer she can get to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:56.400
the client. They find the right position.&nbsp;
For practice, he tells her to hit whomever.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:01.040
Mathilda peers through the scope and says no&nbsp;
women and no kids. She sees a man jogging and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:05.280
Léon tells her what to do. He says now&nbsp;
and she hits the guy with a paintball.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:10.720
Léon is impressed. Later, Mathilda is seen washing&nbsp;
the windows and the dishes and cleaning the guns.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:15.200
They do crunches together and Léon makes her&nbsp;
drink milk. At night, she sleeps in the bed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:19.360
and he sleeps in a chair as always. He wakes&nbsp;
her early in the morning to do more crunches,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:24.320
but she exercises with the same program her sister&nbsp;
did. She teaches Léon how to write and he teaches&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:29.120
Mathilda to put a gun together. One day, Mathilda&nbsp;
thinks they need a break and tells him they should&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:34.320
play an association game. She dresses up like&nbsp;
Madonna, then Marilyn Monroe, then Chaplin,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:40.080
but Léon has no idea who they are. Lastly, she&nbsp;
dresses like Gene Kelly and Léon finally gets it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:44.640
For his turn, he acts like John Wayne, but&nbsp;
she has no idea who he's supposed to be.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:49.360
Mathilda watches Léon taking care of his plant and&nbsp;
comments that he really loves it. He says that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:54.080
plant is like him. She tells him that if he really&nbsp;
loves it he should plant it so it can grow roots.&nbsp;

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:58.240
One day, Léon goes to see Tony and asks him&nbsp;
if someday he can have the money he's made&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:03.040
over the years. Tony thinks he's met a woman and&nbsp;
tells him that he has to be careful with women.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:07.440
He reminds him that he was in trouble because of&nbsp;
a woman before. Léon says that he would like to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:11.760
give some of the money to help someone out. Tony&nbsp;
agrees and tells him that his money is there,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:16.240
he should just ask. Then he hands him a hundred&nbsp;
dollars and says they need to talk business.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:21.440
While Tony's away, Léon sees Mathilda talking to a&nbsp;
boy and goes out to talk to her. He scolds her not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:26.000
to talk to random people on the street, tells her&nbsp;
to stop cursing and to stop smoking. Back at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.120
hotel, Mathilda tells Léon that she's falling in&nbsp;
love with him. Léon asks her how she knows and she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:35.280
says that she feels it in her stomach. He tells&nbsp;
her that it doesn't mean anything and leaves for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:40.080
work. He has a teeny breakdown in the hallway&nbsp;
but quickly gets it together. Mathilda watches&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:44.560
him go from the window. Later, she talks to the&nbsp;
receptionist and tells him that Léon isn't her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:48.880
father, but her lover and leaves the man stunned.&nbsp;
She goes to her apartment and sneaks in behind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:53.520
the tape. Mathilda takes her brother's stuffed&nbsp;
bunny and steps in the outline of his dead body.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:57.920
She finds her dad's secret money when she hears&nbsp;
Stan come in and hides. Mathilda hears him tell&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:02.080
IA that her father reached for the gun so he&nbsp;
had to kill him and that he didn't see any kids.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:06.240
The other cops tell him to cooperate. He says&nbsp;
that if he wants them to cooperate they should&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:11.840
come to his office. Mathilda remembers the number&nbsp;
of his office. She runs after him, gets in a cab,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:17.040
and tells the cabbie to follow the car. Mathilda&nbsp;
finds out that Stan is a D.E.A. agent. She's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:21.360
already back in the room when Léon arrives. He&nbsp;
gives her a present when the receptionist knocks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:26.000
on their door to kick them out of the hotel.
Mathilda and Léon get another place. He takes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.960
a shower and stitches himself up. Mathilda pours&nbsp;
him a glass of milk, hands him the money she got,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:35.040
and orders a hit on the men that killed her&nbsp;
family. Léon says he's not taking the job and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:39.520
that he won't lend her his gear. Mathilda asks&nbsp;
him why he's being so mean to her and why he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:44.560
won't help her avenge her family. Léon says that&nbsp;
revenge is never good, that it's better to forget.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:48.800
But Mathilda can't forget. He tells her that&nbsp;
nothing is the same after you kill someone,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:53.280
she'll have to sleep with one eye open for the&nbsp;
rest of her life. Mathilda loads the revolver and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:57.600
says that if she wins the game of roulette he has&nbsp;
to keep her forever. Léon tells her that she'll&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:02.080
lose because there is a round in the chamber. She&nbsp;
puts the revolver on her temple and says that she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:06.960
loves him, but he grabs the gun and it fires&nbsp;
away from her head. Mathilda thinks she's won.&nbsp;

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:12.000
They go to see Tony together. Léon says that he&nbsp;
took a hit and needs help. Even though Mathilda's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.200
young, she learns fast. Tony hesitates but tells&nbsp;
his busboy to get two glasses of milk for them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:22.320
Léon and Mathilda go to do a job together. He&nbsp;
teaches her how to tell where the chain is. Léon&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:27.120
rings the bell and she starts talking, convincing&nbsp;
the man to open the door for her. Léon breaks the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:31.200
chain and she comes in after him. He puts his&nbsp;
gun in the man's mouth and brings him along as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:35.680
he checks out the place. When he sees that it's&nbsp;
clear, he tells the man where to stand and tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:40.640
Mathilda that it's her turn. The girl puts her gun&nbsp;
together and shoots the man with a paintball. Then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:46.000
delivers the second - security shot. Léon explains&nbsp;
what each shot is for as the man is confused about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.080
what they're doing. He tells her never to shoot&nbsp;
in the face because they need to recognize the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:55.280
client. Léon shoots the man and tells Mathilda how&nbsp;
to take care of her silencer. Before they leave,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:55.280 --> 00:11:00.640
she destroys the drugs. Later, they celebrate&nbsp;
with champagne. Mathilda asks for a kiss, but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:05.760
he says no and tells her to sit down. She tells&nbsp;
him she's in love with him again. Léon tells her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:11.040
his first hit was when he was 19. Mathilda chugs a&nbsp;
whole glass of wine and laughs maniacally, making&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:16.240
Léon super nervous. They go to make another hit&nbsp;
and another, perfecting their routine. When they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:21.120
reach one apartment, Léon hears the man inside&nbsp;
preparing a gun and gets Mathilda out of the way.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:25.600
He tells her that when it's ugly like that, she&nbsp;
should use the ring trick. Léon chucks a grenade&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:30.800
into the apartment and shows her the grenade ring.
The next day, Léon goes to see Tony by himself.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:34.320
He's nervous and sits down telling Tony&nbsp;
that if something happens to him one day,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:39.440
he should give his money to Mathilda. Tony says&nbsp;
that he can count on him. Later, Léon gets ready&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:43.840
for a job but tells Mathilda that he can't bring&nbsp;
her with him because it's a big one. He tells her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:49.120
that he needs a moment for himself, some time to&nbsp;
grow up. Mathilda is left by herself, taking care&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:54.000
of the plant, watching TV, getting older. A few&nbsp;
boys try to bully her, but she just gives them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.800
money and tells them to play somewhere else. She's&nbsp;
planning something. Mathilda stakes out Stan's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:03.440
workplace and follows him inside. She pretends&nbsp;
she's taking food to his office and signs into the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:08.240
building without a hitch. Mathilda follows Stan&nbsp;
into the men's room, but he waits for her there.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:12.800
He orders her to put the bag on the floor and tell&nbsp;
him who sent her. Mathilda says she does business&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:17.280
for herself. He asks if it's something personal&nbsp;
and she tells him that he killed her brother.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:22.160
Stan apologizes but asks Mathilda if she wants&nbsp;
to join him. She wants to live and he says that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:26.320
good because he takes no pleasure in killing&nbsp;
someone that doesn't want to live. Suddenly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:30.640
one of his men comes in and tells him that Malky&nbsp;
is dead. The people he was making a deal with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:35.440
told the guy that a pro killed Malky. Before the&nbsp;
professional shot him he said "no women, no kids".&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.560
Stan doesn't kill Mathilda and tells his man to&nbsp;
take her to his office. She realizes that Léon&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:45.520
killed Malky. When Léon gets back home he finds&nbsp;
a note from Mathilda saying that she's after Stan&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:49.040
and that she's left money for a contract&nbsp;
to kill them if they end up killing her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:53.840
She says she loves him again. Léon quickly&nbsp;
goes to the D.E.A. office to get Mathilda.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:57.760
She's in Stan's office with his men who&nbsp;
wonder what she would do with all those guns.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:03.200
Suddenly, Léon shoots them both and they hug. That&nbsp;
night, Mathilda puts on the dress he got for her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:09.040
Léon likes it. She sits next to him and tries to&nbsp;
seduce him. Léon rejects her because he can't. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:12.880
tells her about a woman that he was in love&nbsp;
with, back in Italy. Her father didn't want&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:17.840
her to see Léon so he killed her. The police&nbsp;
let the father go after two days. One night,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:22.400
Léon killed him and took a boat to America.&nbsp;
Since then he never had another girlfriend.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:27.200
Mathilda says okay, but makes him share the bed&nbsp;
with her. Léon sleeps in a bed after a long time.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:33.360
Later, Tony gets a visit from Stan. They surround&nbsp;
his restaurant. Stan sits down and asks Tony if he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:38.240
knows who killed Malky, considering the hit was on&nbsp;
his territory by an Italian-looking man. He also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:42.960
tells her about Mathilda and the man who came to&nbsp;
get her from his office. Stan wants to meet him.&nbsp;

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:47.760
Léon wakes up the following morning. Mathilda&nbsp;
asks if he slept well, but he answers that he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:51.920
always sleeps with one eye open. She gets up&nbsp;
to buy some milk and they repeat the secret&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:57.680
knock. Léon lies back down. When Mathilda gets&nbsp;
back, Stan is there waiting for her. A SWAT team&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:01.520
grabs her before she can get into the apartment.&nbsp;
They ask her for the key and if there is a way&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:06.400
of knocking so he knows it's her. Mathilda gives&nbsp;
them the wrong code. The men knock on the door,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:09.760
get ready to storm the apartment,&nbsp;
and inform Stan they're ready to go.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:14.560
Once they go inside, they don't see Léon, who&nbsp;
closes the door behind them and kills them. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:19.120
others see that they're dead and call it in. Stan&nbsp;
turns to Benny and tells him to bring everyone.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:23.600
Police patrols and emergency services surround&nbsp;
the building and more SWAT enter the building.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:27.920
Léon waits in the apartment and begins shooting&nbsp;
until he also gets hit. One of the cops takes a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:32.080
look at the apartment and finds himself eye to&nbsp;
eye with Léon's gun. He tells the others and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:37.440
they back away. Léon tells them to let Mathilda&nbsp;
go. She joins him and gets the ax off the wall,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:42.160
while he backs up, holding the officer hostage.&nbsp;
He shoots the sprinklers and the other officers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:46.880
think he shot their guy so they come in shooting,&nbsp;
killing him themselves. Léon shoots again and they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:52.160
back away, asking for reinforcements. Mathilda&nbsp;
apologizes as Léon prepares for the fight. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:56.800
saves his plant from the incoming sniper fire.&nbsp;
Then they go into the other room. The police&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:56.800 --> 00:15:01.280
block out the hallway and Léon makes another way&nbsp;
for them to get out. He shoots a hole in the wall&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:05.280
and puts Mathilda in there. She doesn't want to&nbsp;
go because she knows he won't fit in there too.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:10.640
Léon tells her that he has lots of money with Tony&nbsp;
that they will take and leave together. Meanwhile,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:15.440
the police are preparing to blow them up. Mathilda&nbsp;
is worried that she'll lose him, but Léon tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:19.680
her that she's given him a taste for life and&nbsp;
he never wants to be alone again. He convinces&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:23.680
her to leave down the shaft and tells her that&nbsp;
he loves her. The police blow up the apartment,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:28.400
but thankfully Léon survives. They get ready to go&nbsp;
in when they see someone raising their hand. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:32.960
man gets picked up and taken down. Léon managed&nbsp;
to fool them into thinking he's one of theirs and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:37.680
they get him out. Meanwhile, Stan is pissed that&nbsp;
they can't find one man and a girl while Mathilda&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:42.800
gets out of the building. The medic is taking care&nbsp;
of Léon when Stan arrives and recognizes him. Léon&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:47.360
puts the mask back on and Stan gets all of the&nbsp;
officers out. Mathilda exits from the back then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:52.480
walks right by the cops. Léon gets downstairs and&nbsp;
is close to the exit when Stan shows up behind him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:57.840
and shoots him. He leans to check on him and Léon&nbsp;
asks if he's Stan. When he confirms it for Léon,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:02.480
he puts a grenade ring in his hand and says&nbsp;
that it's from Mathilda. They both blow up.&nbsp;

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:06.880
Mathilda is with Tony who suggests that he&nbsp;
can hold the money for her as he did for Léon.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:11.760
He gives her a hundred bucks, but she asks for a&nbsp;
job as a cleaner. Tony yells at her that it's over&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:17.200
because Léon is dead. They both hurt for him. Tony&nbsp;
tells her to get the money and get back to school.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:21.120
Mathilda goes back to the school where she was&nbsp;
kicked out off and tells them a fake story about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:25.440
how her parents died. The principal welcomes her&nbsp;
back to the school but gives her the condition&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:31.120
to stop lying to her. She wants Mathilda to trust&nbsp;
her. She tells her the truth and shocks the woman.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:34.320
Mathilda plants Léon's plant in the yard&nbsp;
and says that they'll be okay there.
