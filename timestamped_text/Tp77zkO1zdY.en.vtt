00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.699
Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:07.260
Today, I’m going to show an adventure, comedy,
and family film called, “The Witches.”

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:09.200
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.760
Watch out and take care.

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:17.580
Luke Eveshim is a brave and precocious 8-year-old
boy visiting his grandmother, Helga, in Norway,

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.420
together with his parents.

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:24.580
Helga is a loving and doting grandmother to
Luke, sharing with him stories about her childhood.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:29.609
On one particular night, as they make candles
together, Helga tells Luke about witches.

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.769
Not the green-skinned, broom-flying witches
on television, but rather the real witches

00:00:33.769 --> 00:00:37.489
who dress in ordinary clothes and look like
ordinary women.

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:40.719
Every country in the world has witches and
in each country they have a leader called

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:41.999
the high witch.

00:00:41.999 --> 00:00:46.209
But the evilest woman in creation, the leader
of all the witches, is the Grand High Witch

00:00:46.209 --> 00:00:47.469
herself.

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:50.829
Witches spend their time stalking and plotting
to get rid of children.

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:55.000
Helga shows her missing pinky finger to her
grandson, a painful proof of her unpleasant

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.850
encounter with a witch.

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.829
She then tells Luke about her childhood friend
and neighbor, Erica, who was taken by a witch.

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:06.600
Even though Erica had very strict parents,
it didn’t save her, because when a witch

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.880
chooses a victim, the only way to escape is
to know everything about them.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.570
Real witches hate children.

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.140
They have bald heads and wear itchy wigs that
give them scalp rash.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.860
They look hideous behind their human masks
and they have no toes and wear plain shoes

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.950
to cover their square-ended feet.

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.390
The only way to distinguish them from real
people is to look for the purple tinge in

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:26.570
their eyes.

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.030
Unfortunately, little Erica didn’t know
about these things.

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.369
When she was sent to Larsen’s to buy a liter
of milk, she never came back home.

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:38.260
Everyone in the town searched for miles around
but she had completely disappeared.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.729
Young Helga visited Erica’s parents six
weeks later.

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.480
When Erica’s father entered the room, he
looked as if he had seen a ghost, for there

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.899
in his painting, as if it always had been
there, was little Erica, locked in the painting,

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:51.219
gazing at them.

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:54.049
Through the years, the girl in the painting
moved.

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:58.079
One day she’d be feeding the ducks and the
next day she’d be inside the farmhouse.

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.979
The girl grew older too and until six years
ago, the old woman that Erica had become disappeared

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:04.109
completely.

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:08.560
As Helga tucks Luke into bed, his parents
enter the room and kiss him goodbye before

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.340
they attend a dinner party.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.420
Luke begs his grandmother to tell him one
more story.

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.260
Helga then tells him about witches and their
highly-developed sense of smell.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.900
They could smell a clean child from miles
away.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.270
If a child is dirty, it’s the dirt they
smell, but if the child is clean, they smell

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.739
like fresh dogs’ droppings to witches.

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:30.769
Helga warns him that if he ever sees a woman
holds her nose as she passes by him, she could

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:32.349
probably well be a witch.

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:35.129
She then kisses him goodnight and turns off
the light.

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:38.900
When Luke wakes up the next morning, he finds
his parents’ bedroom empty.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.020
A police car drives up to the house and the
officers inform Helga that Luke’s parents

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.069
had died from a terrible accident.

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:49.870
Luke joins his crying grandmother in the living
room and they hold each other in a sad embrace.

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.459
After the accident, Luke moves to England
with his grandmother where she has a big house

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:54.659
and garden.

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:58.650
He attends school and plays in his treehouse,
just like any other child.

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.150
One afternoon, Luke is up playing in his treehouse
when a woman in a black coat dress approaches

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.150
him.

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.000
She tries to make him come down, tempting
him to pet her snake, but Luke sees the purple

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.090
tinge in her eyes.

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.770
It’s a witch!

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:14.560
He starts yelling for his grandmother, but
the witch wouldn’t leave him alone.

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.610
She offers him a bar of chocolate and sneers
at him, telling him that his grandmother can’t

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:19.610
hear him.

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.870
She calls him by his name and this frightens
Luke, who climbs higher up the tree.

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.750
Suddenly, Helga calls out for his grandson,
looking for him.

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.590
The witch stops in her tracks and walks away,
shooting glares at the boy.

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.950
As soon as she’s gone, the snake she left
disappears too.

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.659
Luke tells his grandmother about the witch
and Helga tells him that she believes him.

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:43.650
On Luke’s ninth birthday, Helga gifts him
two pet rats whom Luke names as William and

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:44.650
Mary.

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.350
Helga faints during the celebrations and they
bring in a doctor.

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.580
The doctor informs Luke that his grandmother
has a mild case of diabetes so she should

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:56.189
stay away from sweets, drink her medicine,
and get some rest, recommending a seaside

00:03:56.189 --> 00:03:58.269
vacation to do her some good.

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:02.920
Helga apologizes to her grandson for ruining
his birthday, but he doesn’t mind.

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:08.400
The next day, Luke and his grandmother travel
to a big hotel near the ocean for their vacation.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.469
After they check into their rooms, a very
tall and striking woman enters the lobby.

00:04:12.469 --> 00:04:17.880
It’s Miss Eva Ernst, the chairwoman hosting
the 5th national convention for The Royal

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.950
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children.

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:24.100
The women in the room gasp in excitement at
the sight of her.

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:30.120
She meets the owner of the hotel, Mr. Stringer,
a beanpole of a man, and refers him to her

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.070
secretary, Miss Irvine.

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:37.850
As Miss Ernst goes up to her room, she spots
a painting on the wall with a little child.

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:40.690
She smirks at it and then turns away to the
elevator.

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:43.390
The little child in the painting slowly fades
away.

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:46.950
Meanwhile, Luke goes exploring on his own
in the hotel.

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:52.610
At the dining area, he meets a gluttonous
but friendly boy, Bruno Jenkins.

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:56.410
Mr. Stringer has also got his hands full when
one of the maids runs out of the rooms with

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:59.620
frantic screams and tells him about the rats
she found.

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.920
He goes to Luke’s room and finds his pet
rats in its cage.

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:06.790
Helga blackmails Mr. Stringer into letting
Luke keep his rats or else she’ll report

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:08.830
the hotel to the health office.

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:12.950
The hotel owner reluctantly agrees under the
strict condition that the rats must be kept

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:15.140
in the cage at all times.

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:18.820
Back in the dining room, Helga and Luke have
come down for tea.

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:22.530
Helga spots Miss Ernst across the room and
feels that she’s seen the woman from somewhere.

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:23.710
Assuming that she’s probably from television,
she accidentally drinks her coffee with sugar.

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:28.140
Across the tables, Miss Ernst has spotted
Helga with Luke and looks over to Bruno Jenkins’s

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:32.160
table with a sinister smile on her face and
a dark gleam in her eyes.

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.840
Luke and his grandmother return to their rooms.

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:38.870
Helga rests as Luke takes out his pets and
sets out to explore the hotel.

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:42.450
He enters the banquet hall which has been
temporarily transformed to accommodate the

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:45.760
convention and plays behind one of the room
separators.

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:49.800
As Luke trains his rats, the doors to the
banquet open, and in comes Miss Ernst with

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.460
her group of ladies.

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:54.900
Luke spots the tinge of purple in their eyes
and is alarmed.

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:58.620
But before he can escape, one of the ladies
locks up the doors.

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:01.570
Miss Ernst takes the stage and starts the
convention.

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:05.760
With the hall fully secured, Miss Ernst orders
them to reveal their true selves.

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:10.300
The ladies take off their shoes and gloves,
revealing their stubbed feet and long claws.

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:14.380
They toss aside their wigs and show off their
bald heads full of scalp rash.

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:17.030
Luke gasps in horror as he realizes where
he is.

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:19.410
It’s a coven full of witches!

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:23.460
Miss Ernst takes off her human mask, assisted
by her mistreated assistant, Miss Irvine,

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:25.680
and finally reveals her final form.

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:31.870
A bald, aging, woman with large ears, pointed
nose, and wrinkly, decaying, skin, the most

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:35.830
terrible and evil of them all, Miss Ernst
is the Grand High Witch!

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:40.230
Miss Ernst berates the coven, telling them
that wiping out one child a week isn’t enough,

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:43.540
and demands that every child in England must
be eliminated.

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:46.800
One witch whispers to another one telling
her that it can’t be possible to wipe out

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:47.970
all of them.

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:50.990
Unlucky for her, the Grand High Witch hears
this.

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:54.970
The other witches step away from the outspoken
witch as Miss Ernst casts her horrible spell

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:58.600
and strikes at the poor woman, wiping her
out from existence.

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:01.930
The Grand High Witch then begins telling them
her master plan.

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:05.320
She has a trunk full of money in her hotel
room that she’ll be giving out to these

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:09.230
witches so that they could buy sweet shops
or candy stores of their own.

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:13.530
Once the sweet shop is in place, they will
announce a big gala opening, offering free

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:15.460
candy for every child.

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:20.220
And mixed with this candy will be her special
potion, Magic Formula number 86.

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:26.590
Five doses of this potion will turn any person,
especially a child, into a mouse almost instantaneously.

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:30.920
As proof that the potion works, Miss Ernst
brings in Bruno, whom she lured earlier with

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:33.420
a bar of chocolate mixed with the formula.

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:37.200
Bruno walks into the room, unaware of the
witches in their human disguises pinching

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:38.200
their noses.

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:42.020
He’s taken to the stage and demands the
six chocolate bars that Miss Ernst promised

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:43.020
him.

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:47.050
The Grand High Witch looks at her watch, anticipating
together with the rest of the witches for

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:48.900
the child’s transformation.

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:52.800
Bruno looks at the crowd confused and demands
to know what’s going on.

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:57.590
At exactly 6:15, Bruno lets out a large belch
and cradles his stomach as green smoke comes

00:07:57.590 --> 00:07:59.180
out from his mouth.

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:03.670
His body shrinks, a tail appears behind him,
and he’s reduced into a tiny mouse who scutters

00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:05.280
away into the walls.

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:08.930
The crowd celebrates and Miss Ernst gives
further instructions.

00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:13.860
Before the banquet that night, the witches
will come to her hotel room, room number 208,

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:15.380
in groups of ten.

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:19.750
She will give them each one bottle full of
500 doses and money to buy their sweet shop.

00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:23.540
As they make their way out of the room, she
reminds them to bring their nose plugs because

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:26.080
the hall will be full of filthy children.

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:29.680
One of the witches stays behind to clean the
stage when she smells Luke.

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:32.650
She alerts the coven and they begin searching
for the child.

00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:36.800
Luke runs out from his hiding spot, crawling
and running his way through the crowd.

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:40.839
He loses his glasses but he keeps on running,
escaping from their claws.

00:08:40.839 --> 00:08:44.670
He runs into the dining area and pushes a
table to slow them down.

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:48.910
He then takes a chair and smashes it into
the glass door and escapes through the hole.

00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:53.089
Luke jumps over the terrace railing, almost
getting caught by the witches’ claws, and

00:08:53.089 --> 00:08:54.660
runs towards the beach.

00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:58.600
As Luke hides amongst the tall weeds, Miss
Ernst approaches a sleeping nanny and her

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:00.250
baby in a pram.

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:04.420
Attempting to lure him out of his hiding spot,
she pushes the pram off the hill.

00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:07.259
The nanny runs after the baby screaming for
help.

00:09:07.259 --> 00:09:11.260
Luke runs after the pram as well, grabbing
it just in time before the baby falls off

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:12.300
the cliff.

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:15.350
He hands the baby back to the nanny and runs
to the beach.

00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:19.189
He makes his way back to his grandmother’s
room but finds her deep asleep due to a dizzy

00:09:19.189 --> 00:09:21.240
spell from her diabetes.

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:24.600
Miss Ernst appears in the room and takes the
boy back to the coven.

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:28.660
They pin him down on the table and force him
to take the whole bottle of the potion.

00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:32.350
Luke is sent into a hazy state as green smoke
emits from his body.

00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:34.930
He then finds himself shrunken into a mouse.

00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:39.470
The ladies start stomping on his clothes but
Luke manages to escape into an air vent.

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:44.470
Meanwhile, Helga wakes up from her sleep,
sensing that something very bad has happened.

00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:48.800
In the air vent, Luke meets up with Bruno
who’s eating a piece of cake crumb.

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:51.820
Even though they’ve been turned into mice,
they can still talk.

00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:54.750
They climb up within the walls, looking for
a way out.

00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:58.920
They run through the convention room and scutter
through the lobby avoiding detection.

00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:02.110
They enter the elevator and hide under an
old chip bag.

00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:06.370
Once they land on the right floor, they scamper
through the doors and into the hallway, talking

00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:09.029
about how it wouldn’t be so bad to be a
mouse.

00:10:09.029 --> 00:10:12.800
They hide between the towels on a parked cart
in the hallway when one of the maids accidentally

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:14.170
touches them.

00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:16.940
She screams and the door to Luke’s room
opens.

00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:21.080
Helga inspects the commotion outside as the
two mice escape into the room.

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:25.120
She spots one of the maids with a tinge of
purple in her eyes and immediately shuts the

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:26.120
door.

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:29.660
Luke calls out to his grandmother and she
spots him by the telephone.

00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:32.399
She feels sad seeing her grandson in his state.

00:10:32.399 --> 00:10:35.569
Luke tells her about the Grand High Witch
and the witches’ plan to turn every kid

00:10:35.569 --> 00:10:36.569
in England into a mouse.

00:10:36.569 --> 00:10:37.569
Back in the dining room, Miss Ernst meets
Bruno’s father, Herbert Jenkins, a rich

00:10:37.569 --> 00:10:38.569
pompous man with a roving eye.

00:10:38.569 --> 00:10:39.569
He talks to her about their convention and
the Grand High Witch is disgusted talking

00:10:39.569 --> 00:10:40.569
to a mere human.

00:10:40.569 --> 00:10:41.569
Meanwhile, back at the hotel room, Luke hatches
up a plan with his grandmother.

00:10:41.569 --> 00:10:44.029
He’s going to Miss Ernst’s room, stealing
a bottle of potion, and mixing it with the

00:10:44.029 --> 00:10:46.100
coven’s food at the banquet hall.

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:50.230
Helga is reluctant to let her grandson go,
fearing that it’s too dangerous, but Luke

00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:52.939
insists that they can’t just sit and do
nothing.

00:10:52.939 --> 00:10:56.850
She helps him into a piece of sock tied with
a long string and lets him down gently into

00:10:56.850 --> 00:10:58.600
the balcony below them.

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:01.279
When Luke lands, a black cat spots him.

00:11:01.279 --> 00:11:04.680
He seeks refuge in a plant as Helga distracts
the cat away.

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:08.709
With the cat busy, Luke sneaks into the Grand
High Witch’s room and makes his way to her

00:11:08.709 --> 00:11:09.759
dresser.

00:11:09.759 --> 00:11:14.080
At this point, Miss Ernst has finished her
conversation with Mr. Jenkins and is making

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:15.990
her way back to her room.

00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:20.560
Luke stumbles upon a fake book filled with
the potions and grabs a bottle with his tail.

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:24.620
Miss Ernst arrives at the room and looks for
her cat, finding Helga with her dangling sock

00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:26.019
above her room.

00:11:26.019 --> 00:11:29.390
The witch glares at her and refers to her
as a meddling old woman that she will deal

00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:30.390
with later.

00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:32.839
A knock comes from Miss Ernst’s door.

00:11:32.839 --> 00:11:36.029
The other witches have arrived to collect
their potion and money.

00:11:36.029 --> 00:11:39.300
Back in the hallway, Luke hides under the
carpet with the bottle wrapped around his

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:40.300
tail.

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:43.379
He climbs up the stairs and all the way to
his grandmother’s room.

00:11:43.379 --> 00:11:46.240
It’s time for the next phase of their plan.

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:50.620
All they have to do now is to get to the kitchen
and mix the potion with the coven’s food.

00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:54.339
Helga carries the two mice in her handbag
to the dining room and plans to bring Bruno

00:11:54.339 --> 00:11:56.050
back to his parents.

00:11:56.050 --> 00:11:59.870
She approaches the Jenkins at their table
and tells them what happened to Bruno.

00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:04.240
But when she shows them their child, Mrs.
Jenkins screams at the mouse, insisting that

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:05.550
she’s crazy.

00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:09.260
Mr. Jenkins drives Helga away or else he will
call the police.

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:13.060
Helga runs to the hallway and sees Miss Ernst
and tries to avoid her.

00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:17.620
Meanwhile, an unsuspecting maid in Miss Ernst’s
room rubs the potion on her neck, thinking

00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:19.110
that it’s perfume.

00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:23.470
Back at the dining room, the Grand High Witch
leads her coven into the banquet hall.

00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:26.610
She berates Miss Irvine and sends her back
to her room.

00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:31.459
Miss Irvine, sick of the mistreatment, quits
her position and goes back to her quarters.

00:12:31.459 --> 00:12:33.480
She didn’t want to be a witch anyway.

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:38.149
On the other hand, Helga sneaks into the kitchen,
pretending to be a lost old lady, and puts

00:12:38.149 --> 00:12:39.240
Luke into a sack of potatoes.

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:40.360
She’s escorted out by one of the staff and
is led to a table in the banquet hall.

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:44.569
Luke sneaks to a pot of cut potatoes and looks
for a way to mix the potion with the witches’

00:12:44.569 --> 00:12:45.569
food.

00:12:45.569 --> 00:12:48.939
He overhears the head chef talking about the
soup for the convention group.

00:12:48.939 --> 00:12:50.689
Luke then has an idea.

00:12:50.689 --> 00:12:53.319
He climbs up the cupboard and hides behind
the spices.

00:12:53.319 --> 00:12:55.790
He notices that the cook is a witch too.

00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:58.940
Mr. Stringer comes in and orders them to prepare
the soup.

00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:01.759
The cook goes away to prepare the soup tureens.

00:13:01.759 --> 00:13:06.139
With the coast clear, Luke balances himself
on a ladle and dangles on the tip.

00:13:06.139 --> 00:13:10.220
He pushes the bottle, almost falling into
the soup himself, but manages to drop the

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:12.180
entire potion into the pot.

00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:16.130
He climbs back up the ladle and watches the
cook come back and taste the soup.

00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:20.120
Meanwhile, Mr. Stringer spots the maid who
went to Miss Ernst’s room.

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:23.410
He tries to kiss her neck but is turned off
by a patch of fur.

00:13:23.410 --> 00:13:28.439
The maid inspects herself in the mirror and
is shocked to see the fur.

00:13:28.439 --> 00:13:29.439
Luke’s plan is a success!

00:13:29.439 --> 00:13:30.439
Now all he has to do is go back to his grandmother
and wait for the witches to eat the soup.

00:13:30.439 --> 00:13:33.870
He jumps to a table and the chef spots him,
almost cutting the tip of his tail off.

00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:37.720
The kitchen panics at the sight of the mouse
and Luke quickly climbs up the head chef’s

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:38.720
pants.

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:43.119
The staff helps the chef take off his pants
and Luke escapes amidst the commotion.

00:13:43.119 --> 00:13:46.639
Meanwhile, the cook who tasted the soup is
feeling squeamish and knows something’s

00:13:46.639 --> 00:13:47.639
wrong.

00:13:47.639 --> 00:13:50.649
She runs to the pantry as green smoke blows
out from her body.

00:13:50.649 --> 00:13:54.779
She shrinks into a mouse and scampers into
the banquet hall, warning the Grand High Witch

00:13:54.779 --> 00:13:56.420
to not eat the soup.

00:13:56.420 --> 00:14:00.300
Miss Ernst spots the mouse, but not knowing
that it’s her associate, she squashes it

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:01.300
with her foot.

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:02.920
It’s too late now.

00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:05.110
The kitchen is now serving the soup.

00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:09.450
Helga takes this as her cue and provides a
distraction by breaking her glasses.

00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:13.189
Mr. Stringer comes along and insists that
he will be the one to clean it up.

00:14:13.189 --> 00:14:17.440
Luke goes into a pan and broom just in time
as Mr. Stringer gets it to clean the mess

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:18.449
outside.

00:14:18.449 --> 00:14:22.589
Now at his grandmother’s table, Luke slips
out and into Helga’s bag.

00:14:22.589 --> 00:14:27.139
Across the room, all the witches eat the soup,
even the Grand High Witch, unaware of the

00:14:27.139 --> 00:14:28.649
potion mixed into their meal.

00:14:28.649 --> 00:14:33.060
Suddenly, Helga spots Mr. Jenkins who’s
about to eat the same soup too.

00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:35.759
She runs to their table and spills the soup.

00:14:35.759 --> 00:14:39.779
She hands them Bruno, who talks to them, telling
them that he’s their son.

00:14:39.779 --> 00:14:42.889
Mrs. Jenkins faints as his husband looks at
his son.

00:14:42.889 --> 00:14:47.240
Meanwhile, at the coven’s table, Miss Ernst
stands in shock as her ladies begin transforming

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:48.519
into mice.

00:14:48.519 --> 00:14:52.350
Helga points at her and declares her as the
Grand High Witch, telling Bruno’s parents

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:54.019
that it’s all her fault.

00:14:54.019 --> 00:14:58.230
As Miss Ernst dooms Helga, Bruno jumps into
her chest and bites her.

00:14:58.230 --> 00:15:01.689
Green smoke comes out from Miss Ernst’s
mouth as her human disguise falls off her

00:15:01.689 --> 00:15:02.720
face.

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:04.760
The hall is in total havoc now.

00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:09.130
The kitchen staff has emerged with brooms
and knives, killing any mouse in sight.

00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:12.860
At this point, Miss Irvine arrives at the
hall to see the commotion and she doesn’t

00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:16.810
know whether to be shocked or delighted to
see what has become of her former group.

00:15:16.810 --> 00:15:21.230
Helga faces the Grand High Witch, backing
her up to a corner, now a hairless filthy

00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:22.230
rat.

00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:24.200
She traps the witch under a glass.

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:28.540
She calls for Mr. Stringer and points him
to Miss Ernst, referring to her as a particularly

00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:29.980
infectious rat.

00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:34.279
He finds the Grand High Witch under the glass,
opens it, and cuts her open with a chopping

00:15:34.279 --> 00:15:38.100
knife, putting an end to the evilest and terrible
woman in the world.

00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:42.290
Helga finally hands Bruno back to his parents,
who have now accepted their son’s furry

00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:43.290
fate.

00:15:43.290 --> 00:15:46.550
Luke bids goodbye to Bruno as they go back
to their room and pack their things.

00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:51.220
Before they leave, Luke asks his grandmother
to write a tag with their name and address

00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:52.220
on it.

00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:55.769
After that, they quickly bring their things
and load them into a taxi.

00:15:55.769 --> 00:16:00.290
As the car drives away from the hotel, Miss
Irvine stands by one of the windows and watches

00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:04.069
them leave, thankful for setting her free
from a horrible destiny.

00:16:04.069 --> 00:16:07.240
Back at their home, a large trunk is delivered
to Helga.

00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:10.119
She opens it and finds it filled with money
to the brim.

00:16:10.119 --> 00:16:12.790
It was the money from Miss Ernst’s hotel
room!

00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:16.519
It turns out Luke replaced the tag on the
trunk and had it delivered to them.

00:16:16.519 --> 00:16:20.100
He tells his grandmother that they could use
the money to go to America to stop all the

00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:21.740
witches in the country.

00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:25.920
As they settle in for the night, Helga feels
sad that her grandson is still a mouse, even

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:29.220
though Luke reassures her that he doesn’t
mind it very much.

00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:32.970
Unbeknownst to them, Miss Irvine has just
driven up their driveway.

00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:37.179
She gets out of her car, points her finger
at the house, and casts her spell.

00:16:37.179 --> 00:16:41.379
A bright light appears in the room, waking
Helga up as she watches Luke transform back

00:16:41.379 --> 00:16:42.970
into a little boy.

00:16:42.970 --> 00:16:47.569
She also gives back to Luke his glasses and
his pet rats, William and Mary.

00:16:47.569 --> 00:16:51.579
Delighted at the turn of events, they run
to the window and wave to Miss Irvine.

00:16:51.579 --> 00:16:54.999
Luke cries out to her, telling her to not
forget about Bruno.

00:16:54.999 --> 00:17:07.189
Miss Irvine waves back at them, feeling good
about becoming a good witch.
