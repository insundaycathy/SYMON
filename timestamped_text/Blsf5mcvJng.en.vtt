00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:01.199
Hello everyone!

00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:06.216
This is Mr. Brain Junkie here, and today will
be talking about a science fiction film called Battleship!

00:00:06.216 --> 00:00:09.410
Be ready for some spoilers ahead!

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:14.299
In the efforts to find alien life beyond Earth,
humanity has identified an earth like planet

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:17.970
in a nearby solar system that's capable of
sustaining life.

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.210
Observation and communication labs are set
up in Hawaii, where a giant satellite that

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.910
orbits earth every 24 hours can amplify the
station's signals and send it towards the

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.410
far away planet.

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.910
The world watches as humans begin the first
step in reaching out towards our solar system,

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.910
and the satellite fires the signal into the
unknown.

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.530
Alex Hopper is a US Navy Weapon's officer,
and his girlfriend Samantha demands that he

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.530
speaks to her father about their relationship.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:48.010
It should be an easy task, except her father
Terrence, is the Admiral of the US Navy, and

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.180
the one who taught Batman Ninjutsu.

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.680
On top of that, Alex manages to be late for
their first meeting in the opening ceremony

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.559
of the Naval exercise, and leaves a less that
stellar impression with his soon to be father

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:00.559
in law.

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:04.550
It turns out that the man has a persistent
habit of being undisciplined, and the Admiral

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:09.509
is extremely unhappy with his performance,
threatening to terminate his position.

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:14.210
At the same time, Samantha is given a client
Who's name is Mick, and he used to be a Colonel

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.840
in the US military, but lost both of his legs
during combat duty.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:23.090
The man is extremely depressed for not being
able to perform as a soldier anymore, but

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.299
Samantha tries to give him a different outlook.

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:29.679
She tells him to go hiking with her on the
island where the observatory is located, and

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:33.189
tries to remind him that he's no lesser than
the man he was before.

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:37.770
Meanwhile, a gigantic asteroid is heading
towards Earth, and eventually splits into

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.369
5 pieces after passing through Jupiter.

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:45.170
The department of extraterrestrial contact
notices the incoming objects, and they realize

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.840
that the asteroids are showing what appears
to be a formation, suggesting intelligence.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.579
He alerts the observatory in Hawaii and tells
the scientists there that the objects are

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:55.929
heading their way.

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:59.759
One of the incoming spaceships crash into
a satellite and steers off into a different

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.679
path while the rest proceeds to fly towards
the pacific ocean.

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:08.239
Samantha notices four objects in the sky,
and they crash into the ocean nearby, creating

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:09.950
huge waves in the waters.

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.540
The single spaceship flys towards Hong Kong,
and crashes into the population center, where

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.790
the people panic as the buildings topples
on top of them.

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.069
After committing significant damage to the
population, the Chinese are able to sample

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:26.450
the object, but finds that the materials don't
exist on the periodic table.

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.090
From the way that the spaceship looks, they
think that it's a communications device that

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.140
has crash landed into Hong Kong.

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.099
On the other side, The Admiral receives the
warnings from Pearl Harbors about the foreign

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:41.069
entities nearby, but when he looks into the
radar, nothing appears to be present.

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:45.719
He orders three battleships which includes
Alex, and his brother Stone, to exit formation

00:02:45.719 --> 00:02:47.439
and approach the supposed location.

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:51.930
They send a team towards the alien objects
to investigate, and the main character decides

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.250
to board the ship after failing any meaningful
contact.

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.969
He touches the outer wall of the machine,
but gets thrown back by a shock that sends

00:02:58.969 --> 00:03:00.660
him flying into the water.

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.650
The team quickly helps their friend, but notices
that giant laser beams are shot towards the

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.159
sky, creating what appears to be a shield
around the entire area.

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:12.620
The Admiral sees this and tries to contact
the teams inside, but finds that their communication

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:13.799
devices are jammed.

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:18.380
A fighter jet tries to go through the force
field, but explodes as it makes contact with

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:23.180
the shield, effectively blocking the entire
navy outside the radius.

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.599
Giant warships begin appearing out from underwater,
as the navy stares in disbelief.

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:32.159
Stone Hopper in command of the Sampson decides
to give the ships a warning by sounding a

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:36.020
horn, but the aliens responds by creating
a massive sonic shockwave that breaks the

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:37.959
glass and stuns everyone.

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:42.379
Stone signals for John Paul Jones to fire
a warning missile at one of the aliens which

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:46.810
misses the ship, but this prompts the opponent
to retaliate with shots of their own.

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.450
The ship tries to destroy the incoming missiles,
but fails to disengage one of them which lands

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.340
on board and explodes, killing the captain
in the process.

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:00.090
Seeing their ships being attacked, Alex decides
to fire at the alien as well, but their attacks

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.120
are useless against the enemy.

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.999
Stone commands the Sampson to fire, but their
missile systems cannot lock on after the shockwave,

00:04:06.999 --> 00:04:10.599
and their guided shots are not effective against
the alien ship.

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:14.549
The enemy retaliates by shooting numerous
grenades at the ship as the Sampson tries

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:19.420
their best to deflect them, but one manages
to get through and disable their anti-missile

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:20.420
systems.

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:24.510
The aliens continue to fire and lands multiple
hit on the battleship, which results in a

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:30.390
huge explosion that kills everyone on board
including Stone, as his brother watches hopelessly.

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:35.250
Alex demands to go back to the John Paul Jones,
but upon returning, realizes that all the

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:39.450
senior officers are dead, leaving him to be
the person in charge.

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:43.420
After just witnessing his brother die at the
hands of the aliens, he orders the ship to

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:44.930
engage and attack.

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:50.760
The Japanese Warship Myoko commanded by captain
Nagata tries to backup Alex by firing at the

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:55.150
enemy as well, but the aliens shoot back with
numerous grenades and disables the ship with

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:56.970
a huge explosion.

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:00.940
Despite the impossible odds, Alex commands
their ship to head towards the aliens and

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:04.150
plans to ram into them in order to avenge
his brother.

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:08.530
The crew tells their captain that it's suicide
and that they should save the people on Myoko

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:10.320
which is sinking rapidly.

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:14.760
After Walter continuously reminds Alex of
the dying sailors, the main character snaps

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:19.540
out of his vengeance and orders them to save
Captain Nagata and the drowning sailors.

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:23.900
Surprisingly, the aliens have also ceased
fire after seeing the battleship retreat to

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:25.160
the other direction.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:30.220
However, the giant structure in the ocean
begins assembling multiple Shredding machines,

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:33.920
and fires them towards the harbor as another
vessel leaves the area as well.

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:38.680
Two of the shredders head towards the military
base, and proceeds to wreak havoc on the weapons

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.120
aboard, destroying everything in sight.

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:45.730
The other machine arrives at the population
center and takes down the entire highway system

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:47.460
by collapsing the bridges.

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:52.280
Alex arrives at Myoko and tries to save as
many people as possible, but is shocked by

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:57.750
the chaos of the situation as Nagata shouts
at him furiously for attacking rashly.

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:02.470
At the same time, Samantha notices the alien
vessel arriving at the island and landing

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:06.010
inside the observatory, planning to take over
the place.

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:09.770
The police notices the two and warns them
to get off the island, as they are on the

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:11.610
edges of the battlefield.

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:16.200
Instead of retreating, Mick decides to head
towards the aliens and figure out what's really

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:18.600
happening, despite Samantha's protest.

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:22.780
On the other side, the crew of the John Paul
Jones managed to capture an alien that was

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:24.800
drowning inside the ocean.

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:29.210
They proceed to take off the creature's helmet,
and is surprised to see a humanoid that closely

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:30.900
resembles people on earth.

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:36.170
Suddenly, the alien jumps up and grabs Alex,
creating a telepathic link with him that shows

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:39.630
the civilization's previous history of attacking
other planets.

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:44.550
An explosion occurs on the outer walls that
knocks everyone on to the floor, and numerous

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:48.370
other aliens arrive to rescue their comrade
while the people are stunned.

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:53.750
They quickly notice that another alien stayed
behind in order to sabotage their weapon systems,

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:58.050
and Alex rushes down into the ship to eliminate
the threat with his teammates.

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:01.420
Walter notices the alien breaking the door
and entering the room.

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:05.770
The creature begins scanning the weapon systems,
and the man tries to stop him, but gets thrown

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:07.300
away like a ragdoll.

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:12.120
Alex arrives and tries shooting at the alien,
but the armor renders the weapons useless,

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:16.990
and the team is quickly defeated by the creature
as he knocks them to the floor one by one.

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:20.870
he comes up with a plan and tells Cora to
run to the weapon controls, while he baits

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:22.870
the alien to chase him outside.

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:26.860
The creature continues to attack Alex, and
just when he's about to finish off the main

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:32.530
character, Cora maneuvers the canon behind
the alien and fires, turning him into pieces.

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:37.270
Meanwhile, Mick and Samantha arrives closer
to the observatory and finds that the police

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:39.250
team they saw earlier are destroyed.

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:43.890
They try to look for survivors, but notices
that the aliens are nearby and quickly runs

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:45.090
for cover.

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:48.200
The two are nearly spotted but manages to
avoid detection.

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:53.060
When the enemies leave, Samantha tries to
call on the radio for help, but realizes that

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:54.350
their signals are jammed.

00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:59.970
A scientist from the observatory runs towards
them and tells them that the facility is taken.

00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:04.800
Apparently, the aliens are trying to use the
human satellite system to reestablish communications

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:08.710
with their home planet, as their communication
vessels are destroyed.

00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:13.330
If the aliens manage to establish contact,
humans can be looking at an extinction level

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:14.330
event.

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:18.220
At the same time, One of the crews of the
John Paul Jones who looks like Matt Damon's

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:23.200
doppelganger, discovers that the aliens' helmets
are purposely made to dampen the sunlight.

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:27.330
He tells Alex that the species are likely
to be similar to lizards in that they can't

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:31.550
see well in bright lights, but the captain
fails to see how this can help them win the

00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:32.550
war.

00:08:32.550 --> 00:08:35.960
The crew of the battleship tries to figure
out how they can eliminate the aliens with

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:40.530
their radars malfunctioning, essentially making
them blind unless they have direct visual

00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:41.690
contact.

00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:46.530
Captain Nagata suggest that they use the weather
buoys around the ocean as detectors, by measuring

00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:51.310
abnormally high water displacements that signifies
the alien ship's location.

00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:55.750
Alex is impressed by the captain's methods,
and tells the man to take command of the ship

00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:58.490
as he clearly knows exactly what he's doing.

00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:02.470
Meanwhile, the scientist explains to the group
that the aliens are waiting for the satellite

00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:07.090
to align with the island in order to send
a signal back to their planet.

00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:11.190
Samantha suggest that they contact her fiancé,
as he can use the battleship to destroy the

00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:12.600
entire facility.

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:16.820
The scientist Believes that this is possible
despite the signal jam, as he has a device

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:19.500
at the observatory that can briefly by pass
the EMP.

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:24.630
The man sneaks inside of his laboratory and
manages to grab the communications device,

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:29.560
but is found out by one of the aliens who
looks at him in curiosity.

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:33.650
Surprisingly, the creature does not attack
the man, and instead allows him to leave.

00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:38.030
The scientist runs back to Samantha and they
manage to establish a signal to the John Paul

00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:39.320
Jones.

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:43.330
Samantha tells Alex that they have to destroy
the observatory before the aliens can send

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:48.440
back a signal, and they only have 4 hours
before the satellite aligns with the island.

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:53.250
Alex tells his fiancé to escape the facility
immediately, but their signals are cut before

00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:55.090
he can finish the sentence.

00:09:55.090 --> 00:10:00.000
the crew begins seeing abnormal water displacements
on the buoys, and Alex tells Cora to get on

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.250
the weapons immediately.

00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:06.450
They predict the pattern of the alien's movement
and launches two missiles at the enemy, but

00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:10.050
their attacks miss the target and reveals
their location at the same time.

00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:14.840
The alien quickly begins heading towards the
battleship, and they fire the missiles again,

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:17.030
only to miss the target once more.

00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:21.649
Suddenly, another enemy appears close by and
begins charging at the crew as well.

00:10:21.649 --> 00:10:26.160
The two fires numerous grenades at the humans,
and the people barely escape the attacks,

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:28.830
as the bombs explode on top of their ship.

00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:33.450
The aliens continue to maneuver closer, as
captain Nagata locks onto both of them and

00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:34.450
fires.

00:10:34.450 --> 00:10:39.010
This time the missiles are close enough where
it strikes the enemies at the same time, causing

00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:42.620
huge explosions that knocks both of them into
the waters.

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:47.230
However, their celebrations are short lived
as a third enemy appears on the map, but this

00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:52.230
time the alien moves erratically, making it
impossible to hit them with the missiles.

00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:56.620
Alex comes up with a daring plan and brings
the battleship towards the islands, but also

00:10:56.620 --> 00:11:00.440
putting everyone in danger as the rocks threaten
to sink their ship.

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:04.840
Nagata and Alex sets up their sniper rifles
as they wait for the enemy to appear in front

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:06.350
of the rising run.

00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:11.010
The giant spaceship arrives facing the John
Paul Jones, and begins preparing to fire their

00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:12.010
weapons.

00:11:12.010 --> 00:11:15.550
the two of them shoots at the opponent's windshield
and breaks the glass, allowing sunlight to

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:17.960
enter and blinding the aliens.

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:22.300
The battleship fires everything they have
at the enemy, causing a giant explosion that

00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:25.740
destroys the ship completely as it sinks into
the water.

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:30.100
The crew celebrates in their victory, but
Alex soon realizes something approaching as

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:32.770
he sees the giant shredders heading their
way.

00:11:32.770 --> 00:11:37.779
He tells the people to run, but it's too late
as the machines completely destroy the battleship,

00:11:37.779 --> 00:11:39.870
sending most of the crews into the water.

00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:43.320
Alex runs with Nagata as the battleship sinks
into the ocean.

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:48.120
They jump off the platform in the last second
before the ship is completely decimated.

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:51.870
Most of the crew survived the attack, but
they feel helpless as they have no other ways

00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:54.400
to stop their enemies from sending the signal.

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:58.650
Alex disagrees, and believes that they still
have a chance as they can use the Decommissioned

00:11:58.650 --> 00:12:01.312
battleship USS Missouri that's being used
as a museum.

00:12:01.312 --> 00:12:06.090
They arrive at the giant ship, but Walter
wonders how they'll have enough people to

00:12:06.090 --> 00:12:10.310
operate the machines, not to mention that
everything inside is analog, and they have

00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:12.170
no experience using it.

00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:16.779
However, they see the retired Navy veterans
walking towards them, and is more than happy

00:12:16.779 --> 00:12:20.400
to offer their assistance in saving humanity
from complete destruction.

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:25.100
They make a few adjustments and are quickly
able to sail the battleship into the ocean,

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:29.220
towards the center of the force field, planning
to destroy it once and for all.

00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:33.850
They arrive at the giant machine, but is surprised
to see that it's capable of moving.

00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:38.420
The Object transforms into another spaceship
with numerous weapons and missile launchers,

00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:40.380
preparing to attack at any moment.

00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:44.550
Alex tells Cora to point the guns towards
the side of the ship as they charge closer

00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:46.100
towards the aliens.

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:51.040
He then commands the Missouri to turn quickly
to the side as the enemy prepares to fire.

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:55.650
The Aliens aim at the crew and targets their
location, shooting a barrage of grenades.

00:12:55.650 --> 00:13:00.660
Suddenly, Alex yells to throw the anchors,
and the massive weight lands into the ocean,

00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:04.520
stopping the ship and drifting it's body towards
the aliens and dodging the grenades that were

00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:05.520
fired towards them.

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:09.860
The battleship points towards the enemies
and begins firing everything they have, landing

00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:14.180
numerous hits on the aliens as they destroy
the giant machines creating the lasers.

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:18.650
The entire shield collapses around the area,
and the admiral commands the fighter jets

00:13:18.650 --> 00:13:20.790
to attack the aliens right away.

00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:25.620
At the same time, the enemy begins firing
up the signals in the observatory as the satellite

00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:28.339
moves closer towards aligning with the island.

00:13:28.339 --> 00:13:32.520
The battleship fires their final round at
the communications facility, as the aliens

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:36.480
on the ocean tries to stops the humans by
sending the shredders towards them.

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:41.080
The attack manages to hit and destroys the
entire place before the satellite can be aligned,

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:43.660
and kills all the aliens in the explosions.

00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:47.730
Before the shredders can make contact with
the Missouri, they are destroyed quickly by

00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:51.810
the fighter jets from the Navy, which saves
everyone from being killed.

00:13:51.810 --> 00:13:56.980
The people cheer as they realize that humanity
has finally won against the invaders.

00:13:56.980 --> 00:14:02.060
After the event, a ceremony is held to honor
all those who died, including Stone, the brother

00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:03.100
of Alex Hopper.

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:07.899
They also celebrate the brave soldiers who
fought against the invading forces, including

00:14:07.899 --> 00:14:10.900
Mick, who supported the Navy by providing
vital intel.

00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:16.160
Most importantly, Alex receives the recognition
from the Admiral, who promotes him into commanding

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:18.000
his own ship in the future.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.360
The main character celebrates with Samantha
as they share a long deserved kiss, but she

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:24.750
reminds him about the talk with her father.

00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:29.720
Alex walks towards the man nervously and asks
permission to date his daughter, but the Admiral

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:33.390
welcomes him warmly and tells him that he
knew about this a long time ago.

00:14:33.390 --> 00:14:38.520
He looks back at Samantha in happiness as
the girl give him a thumbs up, congratulating

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:39.860
their success.

00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:45.120
However, somewhere far away from the military
base, a family discovers a strange alien object

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:46.120
in their farm.

00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:52.680
They are shocked to discover and alien inside,
indicating that the invasion is not over.

00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:54.530
