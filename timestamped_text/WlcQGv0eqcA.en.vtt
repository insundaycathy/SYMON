00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:08.510
Welcome to the Breakdown Where We Breakdown
All The Messed Up Shit!

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:13.179
Okay cut the beat cut the beat I gotta something
to say so put on some happy lets player shit!

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:18.710
Okay, so I was just chilling one day, probably
editing, and I got a nice message from another

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.410
YouTuber named WTvF!

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.500
Digital Grindhouse &amp; Drive-In, and he asked
me if I would like to check out one of the

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.430
many movies that he has uploaded.

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.840
Well I was like hell yes!

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:38.350
So After checking through many exploitation
films that he was kind to upload, I chose

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.030
to show y'all a late 70s killing flick called
the Driller Killer.

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.539
This film is about a painter who succumbs
to the absolute needs of drillin' hobos.

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:53.089
If you want to see what happens and see all
the most disturbed parts, courtesy of WTvF,

00:00:53.089 --> 00:01:00.210
then stay tuned for the breakdown!

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.699
The movie starts off with a dreadful title
screen and we then see some long curly haired

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:05.729
weirdo named Reno.

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.659
He kinda reminds me of Richard Chase for some
reason, staring weirdly at this bearded guy

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:13.880
praying but gets spooked away by his touched.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.940
Well, Reno leaves with his girl Carol, and
we can tell just by this back seat conversation

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.189
that Reno really dislikes bums, or at least
doesn't want to be one.

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:28.979
The next morning starts off with this umm,
kinda silly girl named Pamela trying to drill

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.860
in the wall, and Reno takes the reigns.

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.620
We then see that the three tenants all live
in the same apartment, and they just got their

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.760
rent due, including other living invoices.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:45.049
It seems that Reno is going to have to sell
one of his artworks to not become a bum, kinda

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:47.990
like the kind of bums we see him observing
in these cutaways.

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:54.719
Later, Rino visits an art gallery owner, asking
for one week to finish his painting and 500

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:59.390
dollars to stay in his apartment, and not
surprisingly, the art gallery owner says hell

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:00.390
naw!

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.150
Then, it seems Reno is fascinated with bums
for some reason, looking towards a park, but

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.350
then seeing this guy get stabbed.

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.500
I don't know, but maybe Reno wants to kill
him some bums too!

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.480
Later, we see Reno arguing with his girl about
his painting, saying she can't judge paintings

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:22.280
because all she knows how to do is..Reno:
Bitch!

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.720
Bitch!

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.170
Bitch!....

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.890
Later we see the gang watching TV, and Reno
gets incredibly interested in this port o

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.010
Pack commercial, maybe he's thinking about
doing a little construction.

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.480
Later that night while painting, it seems
Reno is getting annoyed at this band still

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:45.450
loudly practicing, so he hallucinates seeing
himself covered in blood and then we see Reno

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.930
go up to a hobo hassling him about why he
is on the streets in a disrespectful tone.

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.240
He picks him up, but then hides in an alley
from a bunch of angry teens.

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.819
Then we see some lesbian action in the showers!

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:01.250
I don't even think I had to mention this,
plus it'll be a nightmare to censor so cut

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:02.450
away quick please!

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.049
Then we see Reno complain about the loud band
to the bribed super intendent.

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:10.830
Then he gives Reno a skinned rabbit for dinner.

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:15.590
Reno cuts the organs out of it slicing it
up, but then he uses the knife to stab the

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.390
head over and over for no reason at all.

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.490
See this what all weirdo serial killers do
before they try to kill.

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:26.770
Then Reno goes to the hardware store, probably
buying what he saw on TV.

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:33.260
Then later, Reno has auditory hallucinations
of his name being called out.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:38.610
He then sees Carol but she has missing eyes,
eventually snapping out of his delusions.

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:43.870
He then hassles another hobo, but this time
has a drill hidden from view.

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:49.459
He then drills right into the screaming man,
viciously drilling into his chest as blood

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:53.420
leaks everywhere, finally stopping after a
full minute.

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:58.030
Later, the three tenants get ready to to a
club to listen to the same band that annoys

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:59.030
Reno.

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.719
At the club, Reno stays away from the club
because of the music, eventually leaving his

00:04:03.719 --> 00:04:05.379
two girlfriends behind.

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:10.549
Well, Reno gets his drill, and begins his
reign as the driller killer by killing one

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:12.940
person in a surprise attack all up in their
face.

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.599
What a bad way to go.

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:21.079
He then meets a familiar hobo drinking, who
talks to Reno unaware he's about to get drilled.

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:27.479
Not in that way, but Reno does drill the hobo
painfully in the belly, letting him fall before

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:28.840
finishing the job.

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.259
Then our driller killer comes across another
crazy hobo, you guys ever seen a homeless

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:37.370
person that's just having a full conversation
with themselves, kinda like this guy?

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:42.449
Well he doesn't ever get to finish that conversation
because Reno drills him through this bus stop

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:44.470
thingie before dipping the spot.

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:49.100
We see Reno killing yet another guy before
running up on this hobo picking up trash.

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:53.030
Then he plays around with this hobo like it
some Tom and Jerry type shit.

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:59.060
He finishes this little game of cat and mouse
by giving him a Agent 47 behind attack! Reno

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:04.570
then comes across a sleeping hobo, drilling
him in the brain in a brutal and long death,

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:06.130
before giving him a goodnight kiss.

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:07.590
What a sick fuck!

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:13.569
Well, with his killing spree over, Reno goes
home where he is visited by a guy named Tony

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:15.940
that is the lead singer of that band.

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:21.160
He examines Reno's masterpieces on the walls,
asking Reno if he could make a portrait of

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.160
him.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.389
Reno tells him 500, and they start right away
as Carol talks about the murders that were

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:27.800
committed earlier.

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:33.530
Then we cut to the tenants eating pizza, I
mean looks kinda slimy too me but I'm a southern

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:36.930
boy maybe New Yorkers like it like that back
then.

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:40.380
Reno is all up in that pizza, but boy you
better eat all that damn crust!

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:42.600
Sorry, just transformed into my mamma there.

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:47.229
Well Carol is super grossed out and has really
fell out of love with Reno in general.

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:51.819
I mean if we were being honest I don't see
what is so attractive about him at all.

00:05:51.819 --> 00:05:53.699
He looks like a smelly butt!

00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:58.880
Stop, but then we see Carol calling her ex
husband named Steven, showing she's about

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.069
to leave this crazy ass fuck!

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:06.030
Then we see Reno painting Tony, but then we
see some crazy hobo who is annoyed at the

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:08.710
music that Tony's band is playing.

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:13.490
Like damn I ain't ever seen someone so mad
at music like that, even if it is terrible.

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:17.110
Reno then goes out and drills the hobo by
his hands to some walls.

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:22.940
He watches sadistically, eventually stabbing
the man in the torso leaving him hanging.

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:27.680
Reno returns to the apartment with killing
intent, but calms down and speaks his hot

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:32.040
breath into his roommate faces saying his
buffalo painting is finished.

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:34.370
I bet that breath is hot and stank.

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:36.960
I don't wanna wake up to no dirty ass pizza
breath.

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:40.509
Then we see him present the painting to the
art collector.

00:06:40.509 --> 00:06:46.020
The collector talks absolute trash about the
painting, like really just grilling into like

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:47.740
it's a painting of a circle or something.

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:53.370
Reno is dumbfounded and mute, but Carol is
heartbroken and she loses herself in anger

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:55.530
as Reno sitting there not talking.

00:06:55.530 --> 00:07:01.069
The next morning, we see Carol is leaving
Reno for her ex husband, forcing him to chase

00:07:01.069 --> 00:07:02.069
after her.

00:07:02.069 --> 00:07:08.030
She leaves her stuff behind to get away from
Reno, and he screams even after she is long

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:09.030
gone.

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:13.870
Reno then imagines himself talking to Carol
on the phone, then is seen dreaming all bloody.

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:17.440
Looks like Reno has just broken his mind.

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:22.020
Reno calls the art collector to tell him he
has a new painting to show him, really he

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:24.360
must have a plan to kill the art collector.

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:32.099
Well, Reno dresses up in a Driller Killer
outfit, then we see the collector come in

00:07:32.099 --> 00:07:34.539
looking for Reno.

00:07:34.539 --> 00:07:37.440
Reno comes, looking disturbed with a power
drill.

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:43.150
He walks towards the collector in a iconic
over the shoulder shot, and then kills the

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:44.740
collector as the screen fades.

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:48.340
Then, Pamela comes back home to see the drill
through the door.

00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:52.889
She opens it to see the collectors dead body,
before getting subdued by Reno.

00:07:52.889 --> 00:07:55.840
We don't know what happened to Pamela to this
day.

00:07:55.840 --> 00:08:00.710
Then we cut to Carol who is with her ex husband
and gets ready to take a shower.

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:05.919
Then while Steven is making something to drink,
Reno comes up from behind and drills him deeply,

00:08:05.919 --> 00:08:06.919
killing him.

00:08:06.919 --> 00:08:10.539
Then, we see Carol getting out of the shower
to dry.

00:08:10.539 --> 00:08:15.759
Reno is hiding under the cover and Carol talks
to him thinking that he is Steven.

00:08:15.759 --> 00:08:20.639
She climbs in bed, ready to hug up to her
husband, calling his name to come closer,

00:08:20.639 --> 00:08:23.600
not knowing that she's about to get drilled!

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:25.500
Well not that way, you know what I mean!

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:29.620
Well, that was a nice little horror movie,
but we're not done yet, lets talk about the

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:34.100
most disturbed moment and most enjoyed moment
in that Spooky Stuff!

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:42.310
Okay lets get right into it, the most disturbed
moment for me was probably the drilling of

00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:45.430
that guy's face, I mean it was pretty nasty
to look at.

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:48.260
The most enjoyed moment for me was probably
the ending, just Carol not knowing that she's

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:49.490
about to meet her end was pretty funny.

00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:55.350
And that's it, I want to give a shoutout to
WTvF!

00:08:55.350 --> 00:09:04.640
