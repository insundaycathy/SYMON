Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:06.439
Today I'm going to show you a Chinese science
fiction fantasy film called Super Me.

00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:07.890
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:14.080
Watch out and take careSang Yu, a young screenwriter
in modern Chinese and global capitalism, seems

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.639
like an average guy.

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:20.110
He is passionate about writing, but his lifestyle
takes a toll on his mental health.

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:24.570
He feels exhausted on a train ride from work;
out of nowhere, a sinister demon enters the

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.369
train and shackles him.

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.460
Sang Yu is terrified but wakes up and realizes
that it is just a dream.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.329
In his rundown apartment, he reflects that
his life is meaningless at this point after

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:35.870
losing his job.

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.840
In the past, he tried to seek help from dream
experts, shamans, and psychologists, but none

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.840
of them was helpful in his struggle.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.050
He uses the last of his money to buy himself
a snack.

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.170
The vendor notices that he has nothing left
for himself, so he adds a free egg to his

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.020
sandwich as an act of kindness.

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.079
As he sits down and is about to take a bite
of his first meal, a man from behind taps

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:57.230
his shoulder.

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.680
It happens to be his work partner, San Ge,
whom he runs away from after breaking their

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.550
contract and leaving work with short notice.

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.730
They both make up, and San Ge treats him a
meal.

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:12.270
In the restaurant, he grabs an aquarium to
use it as a metaphor for what he is feeling.

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.760
He says that the bowl represents the human
mind, the fish represents consciousness, and

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.090
the water represents the subconscious.

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.910
He brings the fish out of the water, explaining
that life is a struggle when the conscious

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.970
mind leaves the subconscious behind, just
like how he feels.

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.390
Sang Yu confesses to San Ge that his insomnia
is getting worse by the day.

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.260
Whenever he closes his eyes, sinister creatures
try to attack him.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.670
San Ge tells him that it stems from his laziness
and that he should pull himself together.

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.770
He decides to head back to his apartment,
but it is locked; his landlord kicked him

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.420
out, leaving all his belongings at the door.

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.250
Without a choice, he leaves the building and
decides to spend some time in the nearby cafe.

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.600
Once again, the demon appears out of nowhere
to hurt him; Sang Yu realizes that he fell

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.260
asleep at the cafe and confirms his theory
that his nightmares become so vivid when he

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:01.260
sleeps.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.600
Already suicidal and desperate to get rid
of his sufferings, he gets on the edge of

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.640
a building, preparing to jump and end his
life.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.480
Upon seeing the troubled Sang Yu, the friendly
vendor calls his attention to offer him food,

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.930
hopefully, so he could change his mind.

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.730
This is effective, and they both sit on the
building's rooftop to talk.

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.190
The vendor asks him about his problem; Sang
Yu opens up that his nightmares are too realistic,

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.160
and he has not slept in six months because
of it.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.950
The old man advises him to consciously think
that he is just dreaming if he has an episode

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.300
of nightmares.

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.340
According to him, having a presence of mind
can make him in control of his life and his

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.340
dreams.

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.610
The phrase "it is just a dream" is now imprinted
on his memoryâ€”a piece of helpful

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.840
advice to escape his nightmares.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.420
Sang Yu watches his love interest, Hua Er,
from afar.

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.610
She works at a nearby cafe where Sang Yu usually
passes by.

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:54.070
That night, having nothing left, Sang Yu trades
his phone for some amount of money.

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:58.620
Later on, he tries to shoplift a convenience
store, but he realizes that his actions are

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:59.770
not right.

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:03.340
He puts the item back and pays for two loaves
of bread instead.

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.850
Outside the store, Hua Er approaches him,
but it appears to be the demon who constantly

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:09.680
follows him in his dreams.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.200
The demon strangles him, but he remembers
the old vendor's advice and says, "I'm only

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.200
dreaming".

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.520
Instantly, the demon disappears.

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.420
He wakes up, holding a priceless artefact
that the demon chooses to kill him with several

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:22.520
times.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:26.800
He brings the artefact to the trade market
for some money; traders offer different amounts,

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.620
but he sees more potential and worth in the
item.

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.670
Sang Yu believes that it is worth more than
their offers, so he brings it to a more exclusive

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.070
antique store.

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:39.200
The owner offers double the price of the traders,
but Sang Yu required more.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.330
They agree on a price, and he hands over the
artefact.

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:46.830
To celebrate, he buys a complete meal, a laptop,
and gets a place to stay.

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:49.200
He fixes his appearance and has a fresh start.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.680
He realizes that he has a rare super-power
of bringing some objects from his dreams back

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.330
to reality.To sleep faster, he takes sleeping
medication.

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:02.850
That night, he hears a knock on his door and
dreams of being alone in an empty hallway.

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:06.480
He tries to go back to the room and use the
elevator but fails.

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.180
Sang Yu sights a vase and tries to take it
with him.

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.750
Suddenly, footsteps approach, and he sees
the demon again, holding another battle-axe

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:14.750
weapon.

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:17.590
The demon runs after Sang Yu and attacks him
with it.

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.859
Sang Yu struggles as the demon chases him.

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:23.490
It is able to reach him and strike the battle-axe
to his chest.

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.790
He again snaps out of it and says that it
is just a dream.

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:31.700
Waking up safely in his hotel room, he clings
onto the battle-axe he brought from his dreams.

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:36.330
He returns to the antique store to sell the
item and gets a considerable amount of money.

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.669
Sang Yu becomes rich overnight and splurges
on things that he could not afford before.

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:44.480
The lifestyle of the young bachelor completely
changed from struggling to get by to being

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.070
at parties and malls all the time.

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:51.960
As he becomes a master of his dreams, the
locations he ends up at are becoming grander.

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.320
Dreaming that he is in a high-end museum,
priceless statues and sculptures surround

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:56.320
him.

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.590
Sang Yu takes a closer look at the things
and try to figure out which ones have the

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.440
most incredible value.

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.400
The golden items amaze him as this is all
new to him.

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.080
He gathers the items he can bring to reality.

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.230
This time, the demon attacks by trying to
shoot him with a machine gun.

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:13.500
It is a far more effective weapon of destruction.

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.480
He tries to dodge the bullets by hiding behind
walls.

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:21.120
Eventually, the demon hits Sang Yu relentlessly
until he dies in his dream without saying
