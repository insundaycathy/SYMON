00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:07.190
Welcome to Cinema Summary, ladies and gentlemen.

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:10.000
Throughout human history things have changed
and yet somehow the same story repeats,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:10.900
again and again.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.500
With 6 characters, and 6 stories, Cloud Atlas
is a very challenging film to tackle.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.520
And because of that, this video will be structured a
little bit differently:

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.360
First, I’m going to summarize every main character’s story very quickly and very briefly.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.500
Followed by a section dedicated to explaining
things and analyzing aspects of the movie.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.320
You can find timestamps down below and on-screen right now.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.230
And with that out of the way, come with me on
a voyage from the early Age of Sail to the distant

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.070
shorts of a far off future.

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:34.590
This is Cloud Atlas.

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.600
We first follow Adam Ewing, in 1849.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.080
He’s a lawyer working for his father-in-law
who owns and uses slaves and,

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.100
and one day while visiting a plantation,

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.900
he hears a mysterious noise, and he tracks the sound long enough

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.300
to come face to face with a slave getting whipped

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.740
And as soon as he makes eye contact with the slave, Adam collapses.

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:55.900
Turns out, Adam’s got a case of parasitic worms

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.540
and he’s being treated by Dr. Goose, a very shady and unscrupulous man

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:01.890
And as he is being given a checkup,

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.309
we find out that Adam has a birthmark in the shape of a star

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.070
Something important to the film and something I will elaborate on later.

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.700
And we then follow Adam, as he's heading back home on a ship

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.000
quarantined and kept separate  from the rest of the crew

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.440
and he spends his time writing in a diary about his experience aboard the ship

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.340
during which he encounters Autua

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.240
The same slave he saw getting whipped earlier,

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.270
who stowed away on the same ship that Adam is now on.

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.340
And somehow they become friends over something very simple:

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.780
Autua believes that you can become friends with anyone

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.350
with anyone as long as you look them in the
eye.

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.200
But its implied its because they are both
outcasts, in their own way

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.360
Autua being a slave and Adam being

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.720
being quarantined and kept separate from the rest of the crew

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.780
Later, we find out that Dr. Goose is poisoning
Adam to steal his stuff,

00:01:42.788 --> 00:01:46.180
and ultimately, Autua catches him trying to kill Adam

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.880
and together with Adam’s help they kill Dr. Goose.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.160
And when Adam finally gets back home to San Francisco

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.350
He’s welcomed back by his wife, Tilda; and Adam intentionally

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.060
goes to his boss, his father-in-law,

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.310
and burns a slave contract and tells him that

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.640
he and his wife, will be freeing slaves from
now on.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.180
Adam, cannot in good conscience work for someone who buys and owns slaves

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:08.700
To which his father in law thinks he’s
stupid.

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.890
It's a foolish idea, it'll be just  a drop in the ocean.

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:11.820
It'll mean nothing!

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.680
But Adam sees it differently, even if freeing one slave is like a drop in the ocean.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.920
It'll be worth it in the end

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.900
And the last thing, we see is him leaving with Tilda, hand in hand

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.680
And that's the end of the first story

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:25.779
“Now what is an ocean but a multitude of drops?”

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.340
This line along with Adam’s story is the
thesis statement of this film.

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.780
It sets up the themes, motifs, and concepts
that will be explored throughout this movie

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.150
Themes of human nature,

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.500
of love, reincarnation, society, oppression,

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.120
and connections we have with each other and the world around us.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.819
All explored in 6 different periods of human history, in 6 stories

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:48.779
Then we follow Robert Frobischer, in 1936
who just like Adam has a star shaped birthmark.

00:02:48.779 --> 00:02:53.500
Now his story is told through a series of letters
that he sends to his lover, Rufus Sixsmith.

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:59.319
And in them, Robert tells Rufus about his
life working as the amanuensis of Vyvyan Ayrs,

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:02.200
a very famous composer who lives in Edinburgh

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.129
While working for Vyvyan in Edinburgh, he
finds a journal detailing Adam Ewing’s adventures

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:11.569
at sea (the previous story), and he feels
inspired enough to write his own composition:

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:13.120
The Cloud Atlas Sextet.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.720
But one night, Vyvyan comes downstairs and approaches Robert

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.580
and tells him about his dream that he had,

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.300
In the dream he heard this amazing song that he had never heard of before

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.280
being played in a restaurant where all the waitresses had the same face

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.920
and although he can’t remember the song.

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.720
And it’s implied that the song Vyvyan heard
in his dream, was the one Robert was composing.

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.960
because Robert was playing it in the middle of the night

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:37.440
Ultimately what happens is that, Robert and
Vyvyan have a fight over the rights of the

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.220
song, the Cloud Atlas Sextet

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:45.079
From there, the fight gets serious and Vyvyan
threatens to ruin Robert’s reputation by exposing

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:51.769
him as a homosexual, and Robert ends up shooting
Vyvyan and fleeing the house.

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:55.840
Now a fugitive on the run, Robert hides in a hotel
where he finishes composing

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.360
The Cloud Atlas Sextet

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.510
And when he’s done, he kills himself, believing
that death is not the end and that he’ll

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.380
reunite with Rufus in another life. Minutes before Rufus gets to the hotel

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.380
and finds Robert's dead body in the bathtub,

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:11.460
reuniting with him, one final time. Just not in the way he wanted to

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:13.080
And so ends his story

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.020
Now, Robert Frobischer's story and the Cloud Atlas Sextet is Important

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:18.840
because they reinforce the theme of connection in ways both

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.960
Physical, mental, ideological,
psychological, fundamental and of course, spiritual

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.960
And we see this very clearly in the 6 main characters all of whom have the same

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:28.310
star shaped birthmark somewhere on their body

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:32.120
Which denotes them as a main character but also connects them for a very special reason

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.740
that I will explain later.

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.940
Which brings me to the Cloud Atlas Sextet
which is a musical composition meant

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:38.580
to be played by 6 musicians.

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.060
And we have six stories with six characters
in them being played by six actors.

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.230
A very obvious connection, right then and there.

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:47.870
But did you notice throughout every single story,
there is a callback to a previous character.

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.820
Robert finds a book about Adam’s voyage back home to San Francisco

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.160
in Vyvyan’s mansion and then later,

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.780
his own letters and sextet, is listened to and read by Luisa Rey

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.560
Who just so happens to be our next story.

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:03.660
Then we follow, journalist Luisa Rey, in 1973,
San Francisco.

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:08.090
Who meets Rufus Sixsmith in an elevator and
he notices that she also has a star shaped

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:10.660
birthmark. Just like Adam and just like Robert.

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:14.500
Later, in his hotel room, we find out that
Rufus is now a nuclear physicist, who wrote

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:17.150
a very important report on a nuclear power
plant.

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:22.850
And he calls Luisa to get her to leak the
report however, he’s assassinated, his murder

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:26.230
is framed a suicide and the hitman takes the report.

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:29.740
So when Luisa gets there, she finds Rufus's dead body on the bed

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:32.200
his letters left there and after reading the letters

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.320
She finds out about the Cloud Atlas Sextet

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:37.600
So the next day, she goes to a record store to find a copy of the song

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:41.600
and we briefly meet a guy who looks very familiar and they both muse

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:46.530
that the music that’s playing in the store,
is the Cloud Atlas Sextet, and it's crazy but

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:48.220
it sounds familiar for both them

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:49.660
But I think I heard this before

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:53.110
even though this is the first time, Luisa’s ever heard it.

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:57.200
From there we follow Luisa as she investigates
Rufus’s mysterious death, investigating

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.620
the powerplant, where she meets Isaac Sachs,

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:02.560
a fellow nuclear physicist who gives her a copy of Rufus’s

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:05.880
report and later as she drives off and he
gets on a plane.

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:10.720
His plane blows up and shes knocked off a
bridge by the same hitman who killed Rufus.

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:13.080
with the report sinking to the bottom of the
bay.

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:16.960
Later, she meets Joe, a friend of her father
and a security consultant at the powerplant,

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:21.930
who tells her about a conspiracy by Big Oil
to make the nuclear powerplant fail so that

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:26.840
the oil companies can be more profitable, and this conspiracy is being led by Lloyd Hooks,

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:30.040
the guy running the Swannekke Island Nuclear Power Plant

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:33.160
From there, Luisa and Joe lure out the hitman and try to kill him,

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.740
but fail and so they are chased throughout
San Francisco,

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:39.062
hiding, ducking, weaving, and bobbing and dodging until finally

00:06:39.062 --> 00:06:41.280
a random woman kills the hitman.

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:45.660
Now, that they are safe, they are able to
contact Rufus’s niece who just so happens

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:49.740
to have a copy of the report that she gives
to Luisa who in turn publishes it,

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:53.020
exposing the conspiracy and the power plant scandal.

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:54.160
And so ends her story

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:57.880
Now, Luisa's story is important because it explicitly
mentions "Reincarnation".

00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:59.730
Which is the idea that after you die, instead of going

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:02.720
to the afterlife, your soul is reborn into a new body on Earth.

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:05.240
In a new, physical incarnation.

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:09.320
Which explains why all the main characters
all have the same birthmark on their bodies

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:12.200
They are a reincarnation of each other and potentially, a reincarnation of Adam.

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:15.000
So this idea of reincarnation is backed up and alluded to in many different ways

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.300
throughout the film

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:20.040
And specifically in Luisa’s story, after she listens to the Cloud Atlas Sextet

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:22.350
she says that its familiar to her

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:24.610
even though it’s the first time she ever
heard it.

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:27.880
Which is very interesting because this implies that the soul that is reincarnating again and again

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:31.740
is able to remember information from other incarnations

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:35.640
Even if it's in a different body, regardless of time and space

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:40.480
Then we follow Tim Cavendish in 2012, who
while attending a award party for publishers and writers

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:43.740
Is accompanied by Dermot Hoggins, whose book he published

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:49.180
and whose book utterly failed after getting a scathing critique from the critic, Felix Finch

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:52.560
and one thing leads to another and Dermot throws Felix off of the building

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:56.140
This causes Dermot’s book, Knuckle Sandwich, to sell like hotcakes

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:58.400
and Tim makes a lot of money from this

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:03.060
But the problem comes in when after he spends
all this money, Dermot’s brothers come in

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:06.360
and demand 50,000 pounds by tomorrow.

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:10.040
Money that Tim doesn’t have, so Tim calls
his brother for help who although doesn’t

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:13.920
give him money, tells him that knows a place where Tim can hide: Aurora House.

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:17.480
So, Tim goes there, but not before visiting
the home of his old flame and remembering

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:22.220
the time that he lost virginity which although
sounds completely random is very important

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:27.580
because we find out that he has a star shaped birthmark as well just like the other characters.

00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:32.000
and when he checks into Aurora House, he wakes
up the next morning to find out that it’s not a hotel, it’s

00:08:32.019 --> 00:08:37.079
actually a nursing home and now Tim is stuck there. A prisoner, perhaps, forever!

00:08:37.079 --> 00:08:39.400
But with the help of a few friends, he is
able to escape,

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:41.569
managing to get away from the ‘evil' Nurse Noakes

00:08:41.569 --> 00:08:45.160
and Tim is free to write up a memoir about his time at Aurora House,

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:48.700
and reunites with his old flame in the process and so ends his story

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:51.240
Now, Tim’s story introduces an idea that is heavily associated with reincarnation

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:55.260
and that is: Karma. Which is this idea that if you do good things and do bad things

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:59.819
you will have good luck and bad luck, accordingly. But this only happens to you in your next life

00:08:59.819 --> 00:09:02.480
Which is very interesting because all the previous incarnations of Tim

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:06.389
have been shown to be very selfish and, well, kind of cruel and manipulative

00:09:06.389 --> 00:09:09.260
like the sea captain in Adam's story and Vyvyan Ayrs in Robert's.

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:13.840
and it seems like in this lifetime, Tim is being punished for all the crimes of his past incarnations

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:17.020
being mistreated and abused at the hands of Nurse Noakes at Aurora House,

00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:21.240
and yet he finds a light within himself, he's able to escape with the help of a few friends

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:24.720
and in doing so, proves that we can overcome our innate desires

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:30.020
We are not shackled by the sins of our past, and we can move forward, forging a better future for ourselves

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:33.460
conquering our innermost desires, no matter how cruel or selfish they may be.

00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:35.300
Becoming better people in the process

00:09:35.309 --> 00:09:41.610
In the future of Neo-Soul, 2144, a city half
sunk underneath a rising sea level.

00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:46.980
We follow Sonmi-451, a “fabricant”, a
clone made to be slaves for the upper class.

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:49.170
She specifically is a waitress at a cafe.

00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:54.240
Her story is retold as part of an interrogation
by Archivist Park, before her execution.

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:58.240
You see, as a Fabricant, there's only 1 thing she wants, most in life

00:09:58.240 --> 00:09:59.720
to be "exalted".

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:03.240
But after a fellow clone, Yoona-939 who shows
her a clip of a movie

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:05.020
based off of Tim Cavendish’s life

00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:06.560
she feels inspired.

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:09.940
Inspired to change society. Inspired to defend herself

00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:14.120
But after an incident in the cafe, Yoona is killed after trying to escape

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:16.430
and one day Sonmi wakes up one day to find

00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:19.460
Hae-Joo, a member of the Rebellion at her
cafe

00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:21.760
who takes her away to the world outside her restaurant.

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:24.600
Welcome to Neo-Seoul

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:30.019
And it's the first time she's ever been outside of it and it's amazing

00:10:30.019 --> 00:10:34.420
And he takes her to a hotel where she’s educated
on a variety of topics, where she’s given

00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:37.720
a choice to choose for herself, where she
realizes

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:40.380
that she’s more than just an expendable clone.

00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:43.200
She’s a person with rights, with feelings.

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:47.640
Then the cops bust in, and Sonmi tries to
escape with Hae-Joo who falls

00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:49.700
and she's captured by the police

00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:53.740
only to be rescued by Hae-Joo who brings her to meet the rebelloin leader

00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:56.100
who asks her to join the rebellion.

00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:58.500
She agrees to be figurehead of the rebellion, the face of the rebellion

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:01.160
after seeing what happens to Fabricants who get exalted

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:04.660
they are executed and turned into Soap–Fabricant Food.

00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:08.920
So she’s taken to a relay station where
she transmits a message, as the police begin

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:13.819
killing the rebels, including Hae-Joo, and ultimately they end up capturing Sonmi.

00:11:13.819 --> 00:11:18.100
And she is interrogated by Archivist Park, she's says something that leaves him shocked

00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:21.620
I believe death is only a door, one closes and another opens

00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:25.180
and if were to imagine heaven, I would imagine a door opening

00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:27.980
and he would be waiting for me there

00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:31.500
and it's after this that she's taken to be executed and so ends her story

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:36.080
Now, Sonmi’s story deals with themes of
oppression, society, reincarnation and love.

00:11:36.089 --> 00:11:38.800
That last thing she says to Archivist Park, before she's taken to be executed

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:41.860
heavily implies that one of the reasons why the souls

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:44.740
are reincarnating is due to their ‘love’ for their soul mate

00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:46.960
It's implied that Adam's soul has such a powerful love for Tilda,

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:50.680
that he's able to reincarnate across human history. Latching onto different bodies, again and again

00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:54.600
All in the hopes of reuniting with Tilda

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:57.700
meaning that Adam's love didn't die with his body.

00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:00.610
Now going back to oppression and society, in every single story there's at least

00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:03.740
1 or 2 bad guys, who represent the most wicked parts of that times society

00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:08.360
who are usually power hungry or greedy, or even representative of dark desires

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:12.640
But in every single story, we have our main characters who find a cause worth living for

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:19.020
A cause worth fighting for, like: Truth, Justice, Freedom, Equality, Survival or even Love

00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:21.720
And in doing so, they are able to triumph over evil.

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:25.449
Creating a better world for themselves and for future generations

00:12:25.449 --> 00:12:30.149
We then follow Zachry, in the year 2311, a
tortured soul guilty over the death of his

00:12:30.149 --> 00:12:32.090
brother-in-law and his nephew.

00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:36.569
He was too scared to save them from the cannibalistic
Kona tribesmen and is now haunted by a demon

00:12:36.569 --> 00:12:38.029
called Old Georgie.

00:12:38.029 --> 00:12:41.240
Although whether it’s just a hallucination
or if its real is left in the air.

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:44.040
Now it's sometime after his village is visited by a
Prescient named Meronym

00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:46.700
– Prescient’s being humans who are able to use advanced technology –

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:50.560
Catkin, his niece gets sick from radiation with a tumor growing on her foot

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:52.839
he strikes a deal with Meronym: He’ll help her get

00:12:52.839 --> 00:12:55.949
to the top of a mountain, IF she heals Catkin.

00:12:55.949 --> 00:13:00.720
After healing Catkin, they set off on a journey,
all the while Old Georgie haunts Zachry.

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:04.100
They manage to get the mountain where a transway
station is built

00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:05.900
– a building from Sonmi’s story –

00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:09.900
and Meronym uses it to broadcast an emergency
message to the human colonies in space,

00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:11.540
asking them to rescue them.

00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:15.860
With that done, they go back home, only to find Zachry’s village under attack by the Kona,

00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:17.189
and after rescuing Catkin,

00:13:17.189 --> 00:13:20.730
Zach goes on the run and gets into a fight
with the Kona only to be saved by Meronym.

00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:26.189
and ultimately, Zach and Meronym along with Catkin
decide to go to the outer space colonies together,

00:13:26.189 --> 00:13:30.490
and years later, he tells his grandchildren
the story of how he met Meronym.

00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:34.000
And we then see that he has a star shaped birthmark on the back of his head.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.800
And so ends his story

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:39.439
Now if Adam’s story was a thesis statement,
Zachry’s story is the conclusion.

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:43.460
It's takes all the themes and ideas that this movie explores and ties it up with a nice little bow

00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:47.579
Because the setup of Zachry’s story is
that he’s telling the tale of how he met

00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:49.740
his wife, Meronym, to his grandchildren.

00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:54.480
his story is literally about his story and history
is the story of Mankind.

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:57.460
It is a celebration and condemnation of all human acts

00:13:57.460 --> 00:14:01.559
of our mistakes and our failures, of our successes and our victories

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:03.920
It acknowledges that we are able to triumph in the face of adversity,

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:06.920
and even in the darkness moments of our lives we can find light

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.634
And that is what Cloud Atlas is all about: it acknowledges that we are able to do good

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:11.400
and why we should do good.

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:13.380
It says that we should be aware of the impact we have on ourselves,

00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:16.380
on the world around us, and of course on future generations

00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:21.500
and that we should not be afraid of death, because in our own ways we shall be immortalized forever.

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:25.900
With our words, lives, and our stories, being passed down from generation to generation,

00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:29.980
as a lesson for them to learn so that they can forge a better future for themselves

00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:31.220
and that is something worth fighting for

00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:33.629
With that being said, thank you so much for
watching, ladies &amp; gentlemen.
