00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.460
Hi, Mystery Recapped here.

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.470
Today I’m going to explain a science fantasy
film called “Upside down.”

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:07.880
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.610
Watch out and take care!

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:17.360
The movie starts as a voice narrates to us...
the rules of his planet which has a “dual gravity"

00:00:17.907 --> 00:00:22.077
In such a world, two planets are so close
to each other that they block the sky.

00:00:22.341 --> 00:00:26.711
The people who live on the upper planet seem
to be upside down for those on the lower planet.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.200
The rules of gravity apply to both the residence
of both the planets.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.170
Hence, they cannot visit the other planet
because the gravity of their own planet pulls

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.399
them down.

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.199
There are three fundamental laws.

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:42.260
One, all matters are pulled by only one gravity,
that is the gravity of their planet of origin.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.719
Two, an object's weight can be offset using
matter from the opposite world, called the

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:51.550
inverse matter; and three, after a few hours
of contact with inverse matter, the contact

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.079
matter burns.

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:56.929
The upper world is called the up top, while
the lower is called down below.

00:00:56.929 --> 00:00:59.569
The status of the two worlds are vastly different.

00:00:59.569 --> 00:01:04.330
The up top is highly developed and rich, while
the down below is underdeveloped and poor.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.530
The up top extracts cheap oil from down below
and sells them electricity at a very high

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:09.530
price.

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.900
They exploit down below’s resources and
prosper themselves.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.010
The people are strictly prohibited to come
in contact with any person from the opposite planet.

00:01:17.595 --> 00:01:21.125
The altercation of this law might be punishable
by death or imprisonment.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.090
The only legal contact the people of two planets
can have is in the "TransWorld" company headquarters.

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.550
It is a skyscraper joining the two worlds.

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.731
People from the up top visit down below for
tourism and novelties like dancing in the ceiling

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.890
But people from down below do not have such
facilities.

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.780
The voice that narrates this is the voice
of a little child named Adam.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.930
Adam is a resident of down below.

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.361
His parents died years ago in a transworld
factory explosion that destroyed half of the city

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:50.920
So he lives in an orphanage.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.870
His only relative is his great aunt, Becky,
who he visits on the weekends.

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:59.230
Adam’s only joy in life is airplanes and
his aunt’s flying pancakes.

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:04.260
One day, when he is at Becky’s, she tells
him about her secret flying pancakes recipe.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.340
Her secret flying pancakes recipe uses pollen
from pink bees

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.198
The pink bees collect their pollen from both
worlds which can only be found in the sage mountain.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.290
She also shows him a book that writes of the
secrets of pink bees, and promises to hand

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.760
it down to Adam when he grows up.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.310
One day, Becky sends Adam to collect the pollen
from the mountain.

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.189
He narrates that the day changes his life
forever.

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:29.469
He climbs higher than he has ever climbed
and reaches the top.

00:02:29.469 --> 00:02:32.159
From there, he clearly sees the uptop.

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:35.660
Adam has a paper airplane in his hand that
he throws to the uptop.

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.840
It flies and lands on the ground there.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.430
A beautiful girl finds it.

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.310
Adam looks up at her, they both smile, and
the rest is history.

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.620
Cut to a few years later, Adam has now grown
into a handsome teenager.

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.840
He and the girl, Eden, have been friends ever
since.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.400
They have been meeting at the same place every
day since the last time.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.819
That day too, Adam waits for Eden at the top
of the mountain.

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:02.260
They meet, and Adam uses the second law of
gravity to bring Eden down to him.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.989
He ties a top to her body and drags her down.

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:10.469
The two run around the woods with Adam holding
Eden in place, but suddenly, they hear gunshots.

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:12.459
They hurry back to the hilltop.

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:15.930
As Adam is sending Eden back to up top, the
guards shoot him.

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.920
The rope slips from his hands and Eden hits
her head on the ground on uptop.

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.590
He watches her lying motionless on the ground
as blood oozes from her head.

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:28.090
Meanwhile, the guards take Adam, separate
him from Becky and imprison him.

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.489
They also burn down Becky’s house.

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:32.230
Cut to ten years later.

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.499
Adam is now a young adult working in a mechanics
shop with his boss, Albert.

00:03:36.499 --> 00:03:40.917
He is experimenting on bee pollen to make
an anti gravity formula for anti aging face cream.

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:45.029
However, the formula only works for a few
seconds.

00:03:45.029 --> 00:03:49.370
The equipment required to develop the formula
further is only available up top.

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.860
One day at work, he is surprised to see Eden
on TV.

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.080
He hasn't seen her since the incident.

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.639
It turns out that she works in transworld.

00:03:57.639 --> 00:03:59.949
Adam is over the moon to see her alive.

00:03:59.949 --> 00:04:03.799
He then starts working at transworld, because
they can provide him with resources needed

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:06.450
to complete the formula of the face cream.

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:09.950
Adam also plans to reunite with his childhood
love there.

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:14.890
On his first day at work in the transworld,
Adam is fascinated by the exclusive workplace.

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:17.220
The skyscraper has several floors.

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.060
The floors with a plus symbol are for the
employees uptop while the ones with a minus

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.460
are for employees from down below.

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:28.260
Adam works in floor zero, which is the middle
floor and has employees from both planets.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.950
The head of the establishment informs him
about the rules of the workplace.

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:36.120
According to him, Adam, being from down below
is fortunate to have gotten a prestigious

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.860
job at transworld.

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.160
Lastly, he informs Adam that if he steals
any kind of inverse matter from up top, he

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.150
will be fired and jailed.

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.740
Another worker provides Adam with an inverse
matter, and advises him to keep it in the

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.440
refrigerator so it doesn’t burn.

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:54.670
After work, Adam goes back to Albert's, who
is mad at him for going to transworld...claiming

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:56.870
that people from up top are evil.

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:01.190
Albert is scared that Adam might get himself
killed trying to work for transworld.

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:04.700
But after a little convincing from Adam, he
agrees to help him.

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:09.030
Meanwhile, Eden is in a self-help group where
we get to know that she has lost all her memory

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:10.600
before the accident.

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.970
She doesn’t remember Adam at all.

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:17.920
One day at work, Adam asks his colleague from
up top named Bob...to link him with Eden.

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:18.920
Bob agrees.

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:22.870
That night, Adam, Albert, and their friend
Pablo are together.

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:25.730
Pablo questions Adam if all this is really
worth it.

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:28.990
He fears that Eden would no longer want to
associate with Adam.

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:31.450
But Adam insists that it is worth it.

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:36.250
The following day at work, he provides Bob
with rare stamps from down below as a gift.

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:39.110
He starts working really hard on his face
cream.

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:42.630
After a few days, he presents the cream to
the board from up top.

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:46.050
He applies it to a dog’s face after which
its face is lifted.

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:49.890
The board is impressed, and gives Adam more
time to make the effect of the cream last longer.

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:53.300
Adam works extra hours that day.

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:57.500
After the office is empty, he climbs on a
tool and calls the up top receptionist from

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:58.620
Bob’s phone.

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:01.230
He then makes an appointment to meet Eden
as Bob.

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:05.210
Later at Albert’s shop, they make Adam a
heavy suit made out of inverse matter to help

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:06.580
him walk on up top.

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:10.910
However, because of the third rule of gravity,
the suit will start to burn after he has been

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:12.920
on up top for a while.

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:17.330
The following day, Adam wears the suit in
a private room at work, and disguises himself

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:19.080
as an up top employee.

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:23.170
As soon as he wears the suit and the shoes,
their weight offsets the weight of his body,

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:25.330
making him able to walk on the ceiling.

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:28.330
He then quickly rushes to the floor Eden works
in.

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:31.570
He is delighted to see her, but she doesn’t
recognize him.

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:34.470
Her colleague informs Adam of Eden’s amnesia.

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:38.270
Adam makes an excuse of him coming to see
Eden, because his face cream might interest her.

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:42.640
He tries telling things from his childhood
in hopes of making her remember him, but she

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:43.700
just laughs.

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:46.340
Then, his suit starts to burn.

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:50.200
Adam rushes to the bathroom., and tries to
reduce the pain with water.

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:54.690
When he pees, it drops to the ceiling; the
pee goes into the smoke detector.

00:06:54.690 --> 00:07:00.010
Just then, an alarm goes off, and Adam is
chased by officials, but manages to run away.

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:03.770
Later that night, Pablo and Albert apply ointment
to his burns.

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:05.970
Pablo is still skeptical of Eden.

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:08.580
The next day at work, an alarm goes off.

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:11.840
The board then announces the name of a few
employees to be fired.

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:14.400
Bob’s name is also in the list.

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:17.420
After everyone leaves, Bob and Adam have a
chat.

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:19.500
Adam feels sorry for Bob.

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:23.910
Before leaving, Bob gives him a box with his
Key card and ID, so that Adam can exit the

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:27.700
transworld building to enter the up top area
if he wants to.

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:30.780
Adam is alone, when he receives a call on
Bob’s phone.

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:32.210
It is Eden.

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:35.890
She is surprised that Adam didn’t come back
after leaving the previous day, and wants

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:37.210
to meet him.

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:40.430
Adam is over the moon, and agrees to meet
her in a restaurant.

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:44.980
He goes to a private room, and wears the suit
again to disguise as an up top employee.

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:50.120
Then, using Bob’s card, he exits the transworld
building, and enters the real up top for the

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:51.410
first time.

00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:54.139
As he looks around, he is amazed.

00:07:54.139 --> 00:07:56.450
Then he goes to see Eden in the restaurant.

00:07:56.450 --> 00:07:59.690
Adam tries to make her remember him which
makes Eden uncomfortable.

00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:02.970
She is about to leave, but Adam convinces
her to stay.

00:08:02.970 --> 00:08:06.570
They chat for a while after which, Adam’s
shoes start to burn.

00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:09.710
He has to get back to down below as fast as
he can.

00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:12.860
The two come out of the restaurant and plan
another date the next day.

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:17.480
Adam’s shoe lights on fire, so he hurries
to a nearby sea and jumps on it.

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:22.750
As soon as his shoes fall off, he is dropped
onto down below and lands on another sea.

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:25.300
Adam finally reaches home but has a cold.

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:27.920
That night, Eden dreams of Adam and her.

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:30.360
She is starting to gain her memory back.

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:34.279
The following day at work, Adam’s face cream’s
formula is complete.

00:08:34.279 --> 00:08:37.250
He presents it to the board members in an
auditorium.

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:39.380
An old woman sits beside Adam.

00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:42.710
He applies the cream to her face and it is
immediately lifted.

00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:44.850
The board members clap for him.

00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:47.320
Just then, Eden enters the Auditorium.

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:51.020
She notices Adam and is surprised to see that
he is from down below.

00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:54.890
She calls him Bob in front of everyone, but
Adam tells her she might be mistaken and that

00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:56.370
his name is Adam.

00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:59.270
Confused, Eden runs away from there.

00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:02.680
After the meeting is over, Adam rushes to
the up top in his suit.

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:04.840
He goes running, searching for Eden.

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:08.529
However, she exits the building before Adam
can catch her.

00:09:08.529 --> 00:09:12.540
Adam uses Bob’s card but it doesn’t work
this time as Bob has been fired.

00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:16.420
Seeing that his cover is blown, Adam runs
away as the guard chases him.

00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:20.400
He manages to escape but doesn't have a way
to go back down below.

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:24.050
Unable to find Eden, he goes to Bob’s house
to ask for help.

00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:26.900
Bob is surprised but welcomes him wholeheartedly.

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:31.370
Adam sits on his ceiling, when Bob hands him
a suit he designed to bring Adam down.

00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:35.460
This suit is designed in such a way that it
will not get burnt, even after long contact

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:36.870
with inverse matters.

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:39.930
Then, Adam shows him the magic of pink pollen.

00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:43.690
He mixes liquid from both the planets and
creates a floating substance that resists

00:09:43.690 --> 00:09:46.150
the gravity of both the planets.

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:50.180
Bob is scared that the transworld has the
formula and will use it to their profit.

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:54.430
But Adam reveals that he never told the people
from transworld about the secret ingredient,

00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:55.730
the pink pollen.

00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:59.700
The company cannot manufacture the face lifting
cream without him.

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:03.529
Wearing Bob’s suit, Adam goes back to the
restaurant he met Eden in.

00:10:03.529 --> 00:10:07.130
He goes to talk to her and surprisingly, she
is glad to see him.

00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:11.360
She tells him that she is starting to remember
bits and pieces of their childhood together.

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:12.880
The two finally kiss.

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:16.800
However, the border police arrive there and
the two have to separate.

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:19.600
Adam runs away and somehow gets back down
below.

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:21.890
The police are still searching for him.

00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:24.370
His escape has made the headlines.

00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:28.360
Back down, he climbs up the sage mountain
and waits for Eden to come.

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:29.920
She finally arrives.

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:32.060
The two float mid air and kiss.

00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:35.940
The two are now in up top together when a
group of soldiers come looking for them.

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:40.220
The two try to run away but at the end, Adam
falls to down below, while Eden is arrested

00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:41.670
by the guards.

00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:45.970
Adam lands on a tree and is saved from the
impact because of the inverse matter suit.

00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:50.110
As Adam walks on the streets of down below,
he is kidnapped by two men.

00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:53.810
They tell him that they are willing to drop
the charges against Eden, if Adam gives them

00:10:53.810 --> 00:10:55.810
the formula of the face cream.

00:10:55.810 --> 00:10:58.140
He is then thrown out of the car.

00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:02.320
Adam now believes that he will never see Eden
again and goes back to his normal life.

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:07.060
Meanwhile, up top, Bob experiments with the
formula Adam had shown him, and finds out

00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:10.930
that they can adverse the effect of gravity
with it; so the people from up top can walk

00:11:10.930 --> 00:11:12.360
on down below.

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:16.000
The following day, Eden visits Bob asking
him for help.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.690
Later that day, Adam is in Albert’s shop
when suddenly, Bob arrives there.

00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:23.640
Adam is surprised and asks him how it is possible.

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:26.680
Bob can actually float in air using Adam’s
formula.

00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:30.750
He shows him he can stay Down without the
help of the opposite-matter accoutrements.

00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:34.490
He has perfected Adam’s formula, so that
any matter can counter-effect the gravity

00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:35.990
of either world.

00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:40.020
Bob also tells him he had purchased the beauty
cream patent before TransWorld could, then

00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:41.800
tells Adam he has a "date".

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:46.430
Soon, Eden finds him in the Down World, and
tells him she’s pregnant with his baby,

00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:49.839
resulting in her ability to stay free in both
worlds.

00:11:49.839 --> 00:11:54.510
Many years later, towering skyscrapers are
seen on both sides, showing that both sides

00:11:54.510 --> 00:11:59.800
have become prosperous, as well as children
from both sides interacting through basketball.
