00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:02.030
Welcome to Moviecaps.

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:07.859
Today I will show you a Crime, Mystery, Thriller
film from 2007 titled The number 23.

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:09.320
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.180
Watch out and take care.

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:13.540
Walter Sparrow works at animal control.

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:16.539
He has a son Robin and a lovely wife Agatha.

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:20.610
He goes to a party and tells Sybil (who is
now his coordinator) that he would not even

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.539
wag his tail for her if she were the last
woman alive.

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:25.119
February 3.

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:26.590
It's Walter's birthday.

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:31.030
A minute before the end of his shift, he gets
a call about a stray bulldog from Sybil, who

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:33.120
is still pissed about his comments.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.350
With a little coaxing, he manages to catch
the dog.

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:37.350
Ned.

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.040
As he checks his collar, the light from the
metal shines in his eye and the dog bites

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.530
him and runs away.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.440
He chases the dog but loses it in a graveyard.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.660
He sees a gravestone with the name Laura Tollins
and is left with a feeling of familiarity

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.100
as though he knew her.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.610
His wife is waiting for him to pick her up
at a nearby bookstore.

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.899
There she sees an appealing red book titled
The Number 23.

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.600
A Novel of Obsession by Topsy Kretts.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.580
He catches up with his wife and jokes with
her about the dog he met today named Ned - a

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.680
nasty evil dog.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.600
Agatha decides to buy him the book she has
her eye on.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.920
That night, as they are having a party with
Agatha's friends, Walter sneaks away.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.350
He begins to read the book.

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.000
"All the characters in this book are fictional."

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.250
At home, he saves his son from his mother
questioning his relationship and is given

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.260
a mug as a present, or you could say he bribes
him.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:30.799
The Book - Chapter 1:In the first paragraph,
the book's protagonist, Fingerling, attributes

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:35.110
his nickname to a children's book, Fingerling
at the Zoo, which Walter remembers well from

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.900
his own childhood.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.630
February 4.

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.930
Walter is with the department psychologist.

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.729
With his faulty sense of humor, he makes fun
of his wife's choice of color for the living

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:45.729
room.

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:48.150
She is not amused and gives him the day off.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.220
She asks him what color she chose?

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.040
"Red, blood red."

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.690
He uses the day to continue reading the book.

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.729
Chapter 2: Fingerling talks about his childhood.

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:02.509
His father wants him to go into his accounting
business, but Fingerling wants to be a detective.

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:07.470
On his eighth birthday, he finds the lady
next door dead on her bed, her wrists slashed.

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.629
Although the doctor thinks it's suicide, Fingerling
believes a neighborhood stalker took her life.

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:15.770
Agatha comes downstairs and asks him how he
likes the book.

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.120
Walter seems slightly confused, surrounded
by old albums, and asks Agatha what she thinks

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.230
of it.

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.330
Walter says that his mother passed away on
his eighth birthday.

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:25.919
It's like his childhood.

00:02:25.919 --> 00:02:28.180
He wonders about this coincidence.

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.599
Agatha coolly continues with her routine and
pays no further attention to his ramblings.

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:35.840
She is convinced that his feelings of familiarity
is natural.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.319
It happens to her when she reads a book.

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:41.930
Walter still does not give up and recounts
more similarities to the book.

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.829
He even gets goosebumps.

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:46.290
Fabricia was Fingerling's sidekick.

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:47.930
Or maybe more than just a sidekick.

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:48.930
He can not sleep.

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.379
Thoughts about the book run through his head
and he has a hallucination of a shadow with

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:52.379
a knife.

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:54.059
February 5.

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:55.760
Walter reads the book in a park.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.620
Chapter 5 Fingerling meets the Blonde.

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.939
She is trying on a noose, but she has obviously
cut herself in the past.

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:06.769
Fingerling talks her down from her improvised
gallows and learns her story.

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:09.489
It's a story about the number 23 and about
madness.

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:11.340
"Pink is my favorite color.

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.129
Do you know what pink is?

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:23.629
Red 27, white 65 - 65 plus 27, 92 - 'Pink'
has four letters - 92 divided by four, twenty-effing-three!"

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:26.459
Fingerling obviously did not understand at
first.

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:29.579
He says to her the only words he could muster,
"Coffee?"...

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:32.290
And tells her a story about a woman in red.

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.669
As he leaves the building, thinking he's done
his job well, the Blonde jumps out the window.

00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:42.049
Later, Fabrizia begs Fingerling to take her
to Blonde's apartment and they have wild intercourse.

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:44.480
Her reaction is typical Fabrizia.

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:45.809
What a turn-on.

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:49.909
As the paper that covered the walls begins
to fall, he understands that Blonde has reduced

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:51.669
everything to 23.

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:54.170
It was starting to add up for Fingerling as
well.

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:57.109
As Walter sits in a park, he starts to notice
it.

00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:00.709
He goes to the bookstore where they bought
the book to find out who published it.

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:02.729
It was self-published and printed.

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:06.709
At the house, Walter points out to Agatha
and Robin the parallels between Fingerling

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:08.059
and himself.

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:13.299
He points out the 23 in his name, birth date,
his driver's license, his social security

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:14.449
number, "everything!"

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:16.680
He was born at 11:12 pm.

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:17.680
23.

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.319
He begins to think the book is imitating his
life.

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:24.320
He asks his wife, who thinks he's still talking
nonsense, "Why this color?"

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.699
(That also somehow adds up to 23).

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:32.500
He met Agatha when he was 23, on September
14, 9+14, 23.

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:37.210
His son begins to catch up and also points
out that their street address is 23.

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.599
Walter married Agatha on October 13, that's
23.

00:04:40.599 --> 00:04:45.800
Chapter 7: Fingerling ties Fabrizia to a bed
and, at her insistence, pretends to have a

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.210
knife at her throat.

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:48.270
She Loves It.

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.550
They perform another mating act.

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.129
Fingerling starts having hallucinations.

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:56.710
In the middle of the night Walter sees more
shadows, they resemble the outline of his

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:57.710
figure.

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.259
He gets out of bed and counts Agatha's shoes.

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:03.520
You guessed it, 23 pairs, just like in the
book.

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:04.909
February 6.

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:08.469
In the morning Agatha covers Walter while
he sleeps on the couch.

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:12.370
He has been reading all night and has found
more 23s in his life.

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:17.550
She finds writing all over his arms and calls
Isaac, the psychology professor.

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:21.789
Walter meets with him and describes that what
he is experiencing right now is paranoia.

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:27.479
He shows him more examples of 23, the human
body has 46 chromosomes, it takes 23 seconds

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:32.199
for blood to circulate, the Mayans believed
the world would end on December 12, 2012,

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:36.080
you can do the math, but it all boils down
to 23.

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:41.780
When he asks if that's the number of the gods,
Isaac says 2 divided by 3 is 0.666 and that's

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:42.780
not divine.

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:45.819
"You are looking for 23, so you're finding
it."

00:05:45.819 --> 00:05:47.730
"Finish reading the book."

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:49.420
Walter is not convinced.

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:53.530
Fingerling sees Miles in his office and the
police psychologist puts him on "emotional

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:54.530
leave."

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:59.410
Without active duty and his gun, Fingerling
is no longer sexually attractive to Fabrizia.

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:03.530
She begins an in-plain-sight affair with Miles,
which humiliates Fingerling.

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:05.760
He imagines ending Miles' life.

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:10.090
As he thinks of him, the fictional character
becomes the real Isaac and Walter's book fantasy

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:11.960
and his life begin to merge.

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:14.949
He sees "23" everywhere as he walks the streets.

00:06:14.949 --> 00:06:19.629
When he comes to Agatha's shop and sees her
talking to Isaac, his paranoia blossoms.

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:23.190
Chapter 21: Miles has seduced Fabrizia.

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:26.400
Fingerling stumbles upon the two having intercourse
in the woods.

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.699
That night, Walter suddenly wakes up and looks
at the clock.

00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:31.430
It reads 11:12.

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:35.250
He goes to the kitchen to get a glass of water
and sees that his hands are bloody and a knife

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:36.250
is missing.

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:39.060
He realises that he stabbed Agatha in her
sleep.

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:40.950
He then wakes up immediately.

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:43.509
He is relieved, it was just a bad dream.

00:06:43.509 --> 00:06:45.009
He looks at the clock.

00:06:45.009 --> 00:06:46.670
It reads 11:12.

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:50.150
Shaken by déjà vu, he impulsively leaves
the house.

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:52.840
He left a note: "Ag, I do not want you to
worry.

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:55.319
I just need a night to clear my head.

00:06:55.319 --> 00:06:57.279
Please do not give up on me."

00:06:57.279 --> 00:07:00.479
He drives to the King Edward Hotel, not sure
why.

00:07:00.479 --> 00:07:02.229
He insists on room 23.

00:07:02.229 --> 00:07:03.810
February 7.

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:07.060
In the hotel room, Walter continues to read
his book.

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:10.120
Chapter 22: Fabrizia has been murdered.

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:11.719
Miles finds her body.

00:07:11.719 --> 00:07:14.000
He absentmindedly picks up the knife.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.460
Later, he is taken away in a police car while
Fingerling flees the scene.

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:21.289
Fingerling's face is stained with Fabrizia's
blood.

00:07:21.289 --> 00:07:26.469
Back at the hotel, Fingerling takes the final
step into madness: he walks out onto the balcony.

00:07:26.469 --> 00:07:28.280
The book ends abruptly.

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:29.690
Walter is confused.

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:33.659
It was not an ending for him, because after
Chapter 22 there were nothing but questions

00:07:33.659 --> 00:07:35.479
he wanted answers to.

00:07:35.479 --> 00:07:36.979
Then he hears a dog barking.

00:07:36.979 --> 00:07:38.490
It is Ned.

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:43.249
He follows the dog and blames him for making
him late picking up Agatha and for these events.

00:07:43.249 --> 00:07:47.029
He is once again in the cemetery, at the grave
of Laura Tollins.

00:07:47.029 --> 00:07:49.199
She died on her 23rd birthday.

00:07:49.199 --> 00:07:52.639
He learns from a priest that Laura's body
was never found.

00:07:52.639 --> 00:07:54.400
Walter begins to put the pieces together.

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:59.540
He returns home with newspaper clippings about
Laura's murder and the fate of Kyle Flinch.

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:03.999
He is convinced that Flinch is Topsy Kretts
and that the book is actually Flinch's confession.

00:08:03.999 --> 00:08:05.590
February 8.

00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:07.490
Walter confronts Flinch in prison.

00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:11.870
The man admits to having been Laura's lover,
but denies killing her and writing the book.

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:15.710
He makes a comment that if he would have written
a book, he would not have used a name like

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:17.100
Top Secrets.

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:20.529
Walter believes him because of his apparent
sincerity and because the letters of his name

00:08:20.529 --> 00:08:22.809
do not add up to 23.

00:08:22.809 --> 00:08:26.020
Robin has an idea about how to track down
Topsy Kretts.

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:30.800
That night, Walter sends 23 empty boxes to
the postbox Robin found in the back of the

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:31.800
book.

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:36.010
That night in bed, Agatha tells Walter, "You
would never hurt anyone, ever.

00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:39.039
"How would you know?" he replies.

00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:40.279
February 9.

00:08:40.279 --> 00:08:44.430
Walter, Agatha, and Robin watch the postbox
of Topsy Kretts.

00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:47.949
Dr. Sirius Leary shows up to claim the mailboxes.

00:08:47.949 --> 00:08:50.779
When they confront him, he attacks them and
storms off.

00:08:50.779 --> 00:08:55.269
Walter catches him, but before he can question
him, Leary slits his own throat.

00:08:55.269 --> 00:08:57.790
Agatha insists that Walter and Robin go home.

00:08:57.790 --> 00:09:01.300
Before he passes, Leary tells Agatha about
an institute.

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:03.329
She finds an ID in his pocket.

00:09:03.329 --> 00:09:07.640
He was on staff at Nathaniel's Institute,
a psychiatric care facility.

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:11.959
That night, after calling home and denying
to Walter that Leary said anything, Agatha

00:09:11.959 --> 00:09:14.880
goes to the now closed and abandoned mental
institution.

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:19.470
She finds Dr. Sirius' office, in a mirror
she sees the number 23 and follows it, which

00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:22.630
leads to a room full of scribbles of the number
23.

00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:24.470
Dr. Sirius used to live there.

00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:28.610
There she finds a case with Walter's name
on it, indicating that he was a patient at

00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:31.240
this hospital, just as the figure of a man
approaches.

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:36.680
Meanwhile, Walter deciphers with every 23rd
word on every 23rd page: "Visit Casanova's

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:41.019
park, dig beneath the steps to Heaven, I warn
you, hell is waiting sparrow man."

00:09:41.019 --> 00:09:44.930
He leaves a note for Agatha, then he and Robin
make their way to the bottom of the stairs

00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:49.300
to heaven - of course there are 23 steps - in
Casanova's Park.

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:52.750
Beneath the last step, Walter and Robin dig
and uncover a skeleton.

00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:55.750
They hear a mysterious sound approaching Laura's
grave.

00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:58.600
They drive to a nearby booth and call the
police.

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:01.070
When the cops get there, the skeleton is gone.

00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:05.250
The cops reject Walter and Robin's insistent
claims that a skeleton was found and is now

00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:06.260
gone.

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:09.870
As the confused policemen leave, Agatha and
Isaac arrive.

00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:14.370
As the three of them drive home, Robin argues
that what his father is telling is true.

00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:16.959
He also begins to see meaning in twenty-three.

00:10:16.959 --> 00:10:19.529
Agatha gets angry and tells them to cut it
out.

00:10:19.529 --> 00:10:20.800
Walter sees Ned.

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:24.320
He starts speeding to run him over, but stops
at the last moment.

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:26.889
Walter sees dirt under Agatha's fingernails.

00:10:26.889 --> 00:10:29.509
It was Isaac's figure that Agatha saw in the
hospital.

00:10:29.509 --> 00:10:32.180
It was Isaac and Agatha who moved the skeleton.

00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:35.529
Once they are home Walter claims that Agatha
wrote the book to make it look like he wrote

00:10:35.529 --> 00:10:36.529
it.

00:10:36.529 --> 00:10:38.360
Agatha's maiden name is ... Pink.

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:41.540
He has flashbacks of her saying she wanted
to write a book.

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:45.600
Then he accuses Agatha and Isaac of being
part of a conspiracy to frame him for Laura's

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:46.649
murder.

00:10:46.649 --> 00:10:50.800
He finds a knife in her purse, Agatha admits
to moving the skeleton with Isaac, but she

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:52.330
did not write the book.

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:54.140
Walter insists on knowing who wrote the book.

00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:56.250
"You wrote the book Walter."

00:10:56.250 --> 00:10:58.450
She shows him the file from the hospital.

00:10:58.450 --> 00:11:01.959
The draft of the book with Walter's name in
place of "Topsy Kretts."

00:11:01.959 --> 00:11:05.680
Isaac comes down the stairs and Agatha gives
Walter his saxophone.

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:09.509
Walter starts having flashbacks, everything
from the book was in this case, detective

00:11:09.509 --> 00:11:12.589
journals, a woman in red, Fabricia.

00:11:12.589 --> 00:11:15.769
He flees, bolts of recollection flash through
his mind.

00:11:15.769 --> 00:11:17.480
February 10.

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:20.680
Walter returns to room 23 of the King Edward
Hotel.

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:24.800
He tears down the crumbling wallpaper and
finds Chapter 23 underneath.

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:30.110
Chapter 23: "You can call me Fingerling, but
my real name is Walter, Walter Paul Sparrow."

00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:32.820
True memories now flood Walter's brain.

00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:36.350
The memory of his mother's suicide, followed
by his father.

00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:38.670
That left him with the number 23.

00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:42.590
Recollection of his foster families, college,
and Laura Tollins while he was haunted and

00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:45.110
tormented by the number 23.

00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:49.100
Memories of betrayal, of Laura's flirting
with Kyle Flinch, her professor.

00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:51.150
How she had intercourse with him in the woods.

00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:54.509
The memory of her rejection when he tried
to save her from the number.

00:11:54.509 --> 00:11:58.250
The memory of him killing her and burying
her under the Steps to Heaven.

00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:00.110
Memory of Flinch's arrest.

00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:03.130
Memory of the King Edward Hotel, room 23.

00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:05.660
The suicide note that became a book.

00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:08.180
Memory of the obsession, the madness.

00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:11.230
Memory of jumping out of the window and being
hospitalized.

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:15.880
In a way, it cured him of his obsession over
the number, because of a severe head injury,

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:17.280
he lost his memories.

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:20.319
That was when Dr. Leary got his hands on Walter's
book.

00:12:20.319 --> 00:12:21.899
The curse had found a new victim.

00:12:21.899 --> 00:12:24.720
Agatha swears her love and loyalty to Walter.

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:28.640
She takes a knife and presses it into his
hand to tell him that he is not a murderer.

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:30.810
He screams that she cannot love him.

00:12:30.810 --> 00:12:32.420
He flees the hotel.

00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:36.410
On the street, he flirts with death, but the
cries of his son bring him back.

00:12:36.410 --> 00:12:38.940
Later, Laura Tollin's grave has been filled.

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:40.820
Kyle Flinch has been released.

00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:43.380
Walter is awaiting sentencing for Laura's
murder.

00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:47.370
He ponders that maybe all is not lost after
all, that he is not the same man who wrote

00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:48.370
the book.

00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:50.610
It's not the happiest ending, but it's the
right one.

00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:51.670
Or is it?

00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:52.830
The End.

00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:54.740
Thank you for watching!
