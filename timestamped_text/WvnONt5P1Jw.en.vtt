00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.840
Hi, Mystery Recapped here. Today, I'm going to&nbsp;
explain an American psychological thriller film&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:09.680
called “Shutter Island.” Spoilers&nbsp;
ahead! Watch out and take care!
&nbsp;

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:20.640
In 1954, U.S. Marshal, Edward "Teddy" Daniels,&nbsp;
meets his new partner, Chuck Aule, in a ship.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.840
They are on their way to the Ashecliffe Hospital&nbsp;
for the criminally insane on Shutter Island. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.480
duo is there to investigate the disappearance&nbsp;
of a highly dangerous patient, Rachel Solando.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:36.080
They are welcomed by the chief security officer.&nbsp;
The Ashecliffe Hospital consists of three wards.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.320
Ward A and B are for men and women&nbsp;
respectively whilst ward C is where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.480
the most mentally ill patients. Admission&nbsp;
to ward C is restricted for everyone. 
&nbsp;

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.400
They meet the lead psychiatrist of the hospital,&nbsp;
Dr. John Cawley. He informs the Marshals about the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:55.440
case they were called to investigate. A patient&nbsp;
named Rachel Solando has recently disappeared&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.000
from the hospital. Rachel had killed all three&nbsp;
of her children by drowning them in a lake near&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.600
her house. She had then brought them inside, set&nbsp;
them on the chairs, and had a meal with them. She&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.960
still believes that her children are alive.
She is highly delusional. Rachel’s mind has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.680
created a false reality to escape the guilt&nbsp;
of killing her own children. She has created&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.160
an elaborated story about the asylum being her&nbsp;
house in Berkshires...giving everyone around her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.760
a role to play in her fantasy. According to her,&nbsp;
the workers of the asylum are her delivery men,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:31.840
milkmen, and postal workers. The doctor then takes&nbsp;
them to check Rachel’s room to search for clues.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.000
The only window in the room has bars, and&nbsp;
the doors are always locked from the outside.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.200
They have no clue as to how she disappeared; it is&nbsp;
as if she evaporated straight through the walls.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:46.880
Teddy somehow finds a tiny note she had&nbsp;
left. It says “The law of 4, Who is 67.”
&nbsp;

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.160
No one in the room knows what the note means.&nbsp;
Teddy suspects one of the staffs has helped&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:57.680
Rachel run away. He asks Dr. Cawley for the&nbsp;
staff’s information, but the doctor is hesitant.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.040
Teddy is now doubtful of his&nbsp;
behavior. They then set off to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.600
investigate outdoors but do not find any&nbsp;
clue about her. While investigating there,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.200
the island lighthouse and caves below the&nbsp;
rocky mountains catch Teddy’s eye. 
&nbsp;

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.200
Back at the hospital, Dr. Cawley finally agrees&nbsp;
for a group interview. The duo interviews the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.320
staff member, but they do not get any useful&nbsp;
information about Rachel’s escape. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:25.440
one of the nurses reveals that Rachel’s primary&nbsp;
psychiatrist, doctor Lester Sheehan, held a group&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:31.120
discussion before her disappearance. So they&nbsp;
demand to meet him. However, Dr. Cawley reveals&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.840
that Dr. Lester has left the island for a vacation&nbsp;
immediately after Rachel Solando disappeared. 
&nbsp;

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.880
That night, the doctors refuse to provide Teddy&nbsp;
with the files about the staff’s information.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.880
This agitates Teddy, so he bluffs&nbsp;
about wanting to quit the case.  
&nbsp;

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.760
At night, Teddy dreams of&nbsp;
his wife, Dolores Chanal.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.960
Dolores had died in a fire. In the dream,&nbsp;
she tells him that Rachel is on the island.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.600
She adds that a man named Andrew Laeddis is&nbsp;
there too....before burning into ashes.  
&nbsp;

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.280
The next day, Teddy interrogates the patients who&nbsp;
attended a therapy session with Rachel...prior&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.160
to her disappearance. One of them writes a&nbsp;
secret note on Teddy’s notepad that says “RUN.”&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.880
Teddy asks every patient about a guy named&nbsp;
Andrew Laeddis, however, every patient seems&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.760
to get nervous hearing his name; no one admits&nbsp;
to knowing Andrew. Teddy suspects that all the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.800
patients have been coached to hide a dark secret.
When asked by Chuck, he tells him that Andrew was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.480
the maintenance man who worked at the apartment&nbsp;
he and his wife lived in a few years back.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.520
In fact, Andrew started the fire that&nbsp;
his wife died in. Teddy reveals that he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:35.120
has specifically picked this case because&nbsp;
he knew that Andrew is now a patient at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:40.880
Ashecliffe hospital; he wants to have revenge.
Teddy starts to get severe migraine headaches.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.240
He hallucinates his experiences&nbsp;
as a U.S. Army soldier during the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:49.680
liberation of Dachau... including reprisals&nbsp;
against the guards. In his hallucination,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.480
he sees several men he has killed and a heap of&nbsp;
dead bodies. He particularly always looks at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.800
corpse of a little girl in that heap. 
In the evening, Teddy and Chuck go to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:03.440
investigate the island itself, but because of a&nbsp;
hurricane, they get stuck in a deserted house.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.560
There, Teddy tells him about a man named George&nbsp;
Noyce who used to be a patient of the asylum.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:14.080
George had pled to an electric chair rather than&nbsp;
being sent back to the asylum. Teddy speculates&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:18.960
it is because the asylum is conducting some kind&nbsp;
of experiments on the patients. One of the reasons&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:23.440
he took this case was to collect evidence&nbsp;
to show the world, the asylum’s real motive.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.840
He thinks that the experiments take place on&nbsp;
ward C, so Andrew Laeddis must also be there. 
&nbsp;

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.600
When they get back to the hospital, both are&nbsp;
given new clothes. In a meeting, Teddy hears&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.560
Dr. Cawley talk about the sixty-six patients&nbsp;
of the hospital. He figures the “who is 67”&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.480
written on Rachel’s note...is her asking about&nbsp;
the sixty-seventh patient of the hospital. 
&nbsp;

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:47.840
But Dr. Cawley dismisses his claims and reveals&nbsp;
that Rachel Solando has already been found.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:53.760
Shocked, the Marshals go to see her. And&nbsp;
rightfully so, she is sitting on her bed. She was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:58.640
found by the officers on top of the lighthouse.&nbsp;
Rachel mistakes Teddy for her dead husband and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:03.920
suddenly becomes very angry. When he gets out&nbsp;
of there, Teddy gets severe migraine headaches.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:09.280
His hallucinations get worse and he sees himself&nbsp;
in front of piles of dead bodies. But this time,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.760
the little girl is lying with Rachel’s dead body.&nbsp;
She tells him that he should have saved her. 
&nbsp;

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:19.120
He then sees Andrew Laeddis who apologizes to&nbsp;
him for causing the fire that killed his wife.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:24.160
Next, a bloodied Rachel is with her dead&nbsp;
children. He helps her take them out to the lake.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:28.800
He suddenly wakes up from the dream. Then, Teddy’s&nbsp;
wife comes in through the door to tell him that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:34.320
Andrew Laeddis is not dead. She wants Teddy to&nbsp;
find him, and then kill him. Teddy wakes up in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:39.600
morning and realizes that it was all a dream. 
The following day, all the electric security&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:44.346
system fails due to the storm...giving Chuck and&nbsp;
Teddy a chance to go to the infamous ward C. 
&nbsp;

00:05:45.609 --> 00:05:47.520
There, Teddy meets George Noyce, a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:52.960
patient in solitary confinement. George tells him&nbsp;
about the experiments going on in the lighthouse.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:57.680
He claims that the doctors are experimenting&nbsp;
on patients, some of whom are lobotomized.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.720
The officials of the hospital knew all this time&nbsp;
of Teddy’s plan to expose them. In fact, they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:08.320
knowingly appointed him for the job. According to&nbsp;
George, everyone on the island, including Chuck,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:12.640
is in an elaborate plan to declare Teddy a patient&nbsp;
of the hospital and get him to the lighthouse. 
&nbsp;

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:18.000
Teddy now believes that since Laeddis is not&nbsp;
in ward C, he is definitely in the lighthouse.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:23.600
Later, Teddy and Chuck move towards the lighthouse&nbsp;
to investigate it. They get into a little argument&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:28.800
midway so they go on different ways. Teddy comes&nbsp;
across a dead end, so he goes back to where Chuck&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:34.000
was... only to find his dead body on the ground&nbsp;
down the cliff. But when he goes down to check,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:40.640
Chuck has disappeared. Then Teddy finds a cave.&nbsp;
Inside it...is a woman. She introduces herself&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:45.840
as the real Rachel Solando. Rachel used to&nbsp;
be a psychiatrist at Ashecliffe Hospital.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:49.440
But when she got to know about the&nbsp;
illegal experiments done by the hospital,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:54.560
she protested, so she was falsely accused of&nbsp;
being insane and was admitted into the hospital.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:58.400
But Rachel had somehow managed to run away&nbsp;
from there, and hide in the tiny cave.
&nbsp;

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:03.920
Everyone on the island knows about the&nbsp;
experiments. The asylum conducts a surgery on its&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:08.480
patients called the transorbital lobotomy, where&nbsp;
they electrically shock the patient, pull out some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:13.280
nerves fiber from the eyes. According to her,&nbsp;
Teddy won’t get away alive from the island. 
&nbsp;

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.800
The next morning, Teddy goes back to the&nbsp;
hospital. He asks Dr. Cawley about Chuck,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:23.920
but shockingly, Cawley doesn’t remember him.&nbsp;
In fact, every evidence of Chuck’s existence&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:29.520
is gone. Teddy is now distressed. He believes&nbsp;
that this is an attempt to make him look crazy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:33.200
He plans to distract the staff by burning&nbsp;
a car to run away to the lighthouse. 
&nbsp;

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:37.840
The explosion successfully distracts&nbsp;
everyone, and Teddy swims to the lighthouse.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:41.200
He threatens a guard, and&nbsp;
manages to go on top of it. 
&nbsp;

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:46.400
He finally arrives in the lighthouse; he tries to&nbsp;
figure out what experiment is carried out here.
 
&nbsp;

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:52.400
When he opens the last room, there is no sort&nbsp;
of experiment going on as he had assumed. Dr.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:57.360
Cawley sits in the middle of the room on his desk.&nbsp;
Teddy confronts him about the real Rachel Solando,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:02.080
but Dr. Cawley is weirdly calm. He tells Teddy&nbsp;
that he has been a patient of the hospital for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:06.880
two years now. Teddy thinks that the doctor wants&nbsp;
to convince him that he is insane to hold him on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:13.120
the island. But Dr. Cawley has all the proof. 
Teddy’s real name is Andrew Laeddis and he is an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:17.920
extremely delusional patient of the Ashecliffe&nbsp;
Hospital. Andrew is in fact the sixty-seventh&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:21.760
patient of the hospital ,and the most&nbsp;
dangerous patient, incarcerated in Ward&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:26.720
C for murdering his manic depressive wife
Dr Cawley shows him that the names "Edward&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:31.280
Daniels" and "Rachel Solando"... are just anagrams&nbsp;
of the names "Andrew Laeddis" and "Dolores&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:36.640
Chanal"... with the same thirteen letters.
Andrew has created another self, Edward "Teddy"&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:40.960
Daniels to avoid the guilt of his horrendous&nbsp;
crime. And to go along with the character of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:46.080
Teddy, he has also created a false reality in his&nbsp;
brain that justifies Teddy being on this island.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:51.600
Rachel Solando never existed, it was a&nbsp;
product of Andrew’s mind. The past week,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:56.400
doctors had decided to let Andrew play out his&nbsp;
fantasy in order to bring him back to reality.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:00.960
This is his last chance at sanity..after which he&nbsp;
will be lobotomized as per the court’s order. 
&nbsp;

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:05.680
Then, Chuck comes into the room and&nbsp;
introduces himself as Dr. Lester Sheehan.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:11.440
In reality, Chuck has been Andrew’s primary&nbsp;
doctor for two years now. Hearing the truth,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:16.720
Andrew gets agitated and attacks Dr. Lester.&nbsp;
Dr. Cawley calms him by showing him the pictures&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:22.080
of his three dead children. One of them is the&nbsp;
little girl who is always in Andrew’s dreams. 
&nbsp;

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:26.960
He finally calms down. He goes unconscious and&nbsp;
begins to have a flashback about what actually&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:32.160
happened to him and his wife, Dolores. 
In his flashback, we see Andrew who came back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:36.800
home from work that day. He was surprised to see&nbsp;
Dolores had killed all three of their children&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:41.600
by drowning them in the lake. Andrew blamed&nbsp;
himself for not saving the kids, so he shot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:46.800
his wife dead for murdering the children. 
When he wakes up, he is back to his senses.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:50.960
He admits that Rachel Solando and Teddy&nbsp;
Daniels are just characters he made up.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:53.920
Teddy’s wife had drowned their&nbsp;
children in the lake near their cabin,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:59.120
and because of this, he had killed his wife. 
The doctors are satisfied to see he has come back,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:03.840
but is scared because he has relapsed&nbsp;
before. Some time later, Dr. Lester and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:08.560
Andrew are chatting when he refers to the doctor&nbsp;
as Chuck again. The doctors are disappointed. 
&nbsp;

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:13.360
The warden gestures to the orderlies, and&nbsp;
Andrew is taken away to be lobotomized.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:17.840
Andrew asks Dr. Lester if it would be&nbsp;
worse "to live as a monster, or to die&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:22.320
as a good man?" A stunned Lester calls Andrew&nbsp;
"Teddy" but he does not respond to the name.
&nbsp;

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:27.120
The movie ends as we see Andrew peacefully&nbsp;
going with the officials to be lobotomized.
&nbsp;

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:31.840
Now, for the explanation of the movie. 
The whole movie is from the point of a mentally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:35.920
ill patient, Andrew Laeddies who thinks he&nbsp;
is a US Marshal investigating a case.
&nbsp;

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:41.360
Andrew’s wife, Dolores Chanal, had always been&nbsp;
mentally ill, but he loved her too much to let her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:46.800
go. One day when Andrew came back home from work,&nbsp;
Dolores had killed all three of their children by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:52.080
drowning them in the lake. Andrew blamed himself&nbsp;
for not saving the kids. This was the reason the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:56.480
girl in his dreams told him that he should have&nbsp;
saved her. He shot his wife dead for murdering&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:56.480 --> 00:11:00.880
the children. But Andrew’s mind could not handle&nbsp;
the grief and guilt of his family’s death.
&nbsp;

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:07.360
So, he painted himself as Edward “Teddy” Daniels.&nbsp;
In reality, the name “Edward Daniels” is just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:11.600
“Andrew Laeddis” with mismatched letters; and&nbsp;
so is “Rachel Solando” to “Dolores Chanal”.

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:16.480
In his fantasy, Andrew is still a US&nbsp;
Marshal and his reasoning for being on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:21.200
the island is that he is there to investigate the&nbsp;
disappearance of Rachel Solando, while actually,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:26.080
Rachel is just a nurse of the hospital. 
Similarly, Andrew gave a role to everyone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:30.960
around him to match his fantasy. He painted&nbsp;
his doctor, Lester, as his partner Chuck.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:35.600
Him finding the real Rachel Solando in the&nbsp;
cave was just a part of his hallucinations. 
&nbsp;

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:39.760
At the beginning of the movie, we see&nbsp;
“Teddy” tell “Chuck” that Dolores had&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:44.400
died in an apartment fire. This is because she had&nbsp;
burned their apartment building once before. 
&nbsp;

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:49.280
Two weeks prior, Andrew had beaten up&nbsp;
another ward C patient named George Noyce.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:54.320
So the officials had ordered to lobotomize&nbsp;
him. Dr. Cawley’s last resort to bring&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:57.680
Andrew back to reality was to let him&nbsp;
play the role of Teddy for a week. 
&nbsp;

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:03.760
Hence, the whole hospital participated in Andrew’s&nbsp;
fantasy. But they are only able to bring him back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:08.000
to his senses for a few hours.
However, at the end of the story,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.480
Andrew doesn’t react to being called Teddy and&nbsp;
peacefully goes to be lobotomized...suggesting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:16.560
that Andrew had come back to his senses but he&nbsp;
did not want to live as a monster anymore. 
&nbsp;

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:19.680
That’s my explanation for the&nbsp;
movie “Shutter Island.”
