00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:11.280
Hey everyone. Welcome back to Movie Recap.&nbsp;
My name is Silverra. Today I'm gonna show&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:17.200
you a 1995 science fiction action film, based on&nbsp;
2000 AD comics characters called, Judge Dredd.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.800
When the story opens, Herman "Fergee"&nbsp;
Ferguson is returning to Mega City 1&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.360
after serving a sentence in the Aspen&nbsp;
Penal Colony. He arrives at his new home,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:34.000
Heavenly Haven, a dangerous neighborhood&nbsp;
which is embroiled in a vicious "block" war.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.160
Gangsters have set up their command post&nbsp;
in his new apartment and have opened fire&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:44.000
on their rivals in another building and on the&nbsp;
street, 40 stories below. Fergee finds himself&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.632
an unwitting accomplice, passing&nbsp;
ammunition to the block warriors.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.920
Street Judges Hershey and her candidate&nbsp;
judge respond to the block war.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.400
Hershey calls immediately for backup, which&nbsp;
arrives in the form of Judge Joseph Dredd,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.120
the most famous of all the Street Judges.&nbsp;
He leads an assault on the block warriors,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.320
dispatching several of them rapidly with his&nbsp;
pistol, the Lawgiver 2. Hershey's candidate is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.360
killed when he rushes into the command post and&nbsp;
is shot immediately. Dredd kills everyone but the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.160
block war leader and charges him with several&nbsp;
violations of the Mega City Municipal Code,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:23.440
before summarily executing him for the candidate's&nbsp;
murder. He announces that court is adjourned.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.720
Outside the apartment, he finds Fergee hiding in&nbsp;
a servo-droid and finds him guilty as a repeat&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:34.000
offender, giving him five more years in Aspen.&nbsp;
Fergee claims he's innocent and was hiding from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.760
the block warriors, however, Dredd refuses to be&nbsp;
swayed and dismisses Fergee to re-incarceration.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:44.320
Dredd reports to Chief Justice Fargo, who&nbsp;
questions Dredd's hardened methods of summary&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.600
execution. He believes Dredd when the judge&nbsp;
tells him that the executions were unavoidable.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.840
Fargo assigns Dredd to teaching ethics&nbsp;
at the academy a few days per week.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.040
At the Aspen Penal Colony, Warden Miller meets&nbsp;
with a man named Rico and gives him a small&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:06.240
object that contains a copy of Rico's badge&nbsp;
and a picture of a reporter, Vartis Hammond,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.880
who has done several investigative reports&nbsp;
on the Street Judges which are high critical.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.600
Rico suddenly unlocks a secret compartment&nbsp;
in the box and it becomes a small pistol,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.160
which he uses to shoot Miller through the throat.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.600
Miller is unable to match the voice-identification&nbsp;
that disarms the cannons in Rico's cell and he is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.560
immediately killed by them. Rico hides and is able&nbsp;
to massacre the guards who rush into the room.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.440
At the Academy, Dredd tells a pool of&nbsp;
cadets about the weaponry of a street judge&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.160
and how little of it matters where knowledge&nbsp;
of the Mega City Municipal Code is concerned.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.560
He also tells them that they stand a high&nbsp;
chance of being killed on duty and that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.320
if they live to old age they will undertake&nbsp;
the Long Walk into the Cursed Earth,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:53.520
where they will teach the savage denizens outside&nbsp;
the city walls of the law. Hershey later speaks to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.720
Dredd about his obstinate personality and whether&nbsp;
he had any friends. Dredd tells her that he did&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.421
have a friend at the Academy but was forced to&nbsp;
judge and sentence him when he broke the law.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.400
Rico stows away on a shuttle from&nbsp;
Aspen in a body bag. In Mega City,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:16.400
he goes to a pawn shop and retrieves a box set&nbsp;
aside for him. In the box is a judge's uniform&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:22.000
and a Lawgiver pistol. When Rico reaches for the&nbsp;
pistol, the pawnshop owner warns him not to pick&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.360
it up because all Lawgiver's are booby-trapped and&nbsp;
will only recognize the grip of a street judge.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:32.080
Rico picks up the pistol, unharmed by the&nbsp;
defense mechanism, and shoots the man dead,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:38.400
revealing that he is a judge himself. Rico finds&nbsp;
a giant combat droid, an ABC Warrior, in the shop&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.202
and reactivates it, giving it the duty of being&nbsp;
his personal bodyguard and a mission of "war".

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.120
At Hammond's apartment, an unidentifiable&nbsp;
judge bursts in and kills Hammond and his wife.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.600
The incident is captured on a security&nbsp;
camera and Hammond's final word is "DREDD!!"&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.980
Dredd is arrested on the street&nbsp;
and incarcerated for trial.

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:06.560
Dredd chooses Hershey to defend him due to&nbsp;
her expertise in criminal law. At the trial,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.960
the recording from the security camera is&nbsp;
presented, however, Hershey successfully has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:16.240
the evidence dismissed as circumstantial since&nbsp;
Dredd cannot be positively identified. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:21.520
new evidence is presented; the Lawgiver 2 pistol&nbsp;
has a secret feature that captures the DNA of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:26.880
the wielder and imprints it on every round of&nbsp;
ammunition fired. The DNA from the rounds that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:32.000
killed Hammond and his wife are an exact match&nbsp;
for Dredd himself. Hershey and Dredd's defense&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.440
crumbles and Dredd is sentenced to death. Fargo,&nbsp;
who is overcome with guilt at seeing Dredd, one of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.640
his greatest students, sentenced, decides, with&nbsp;
some goading from Justice Griffin, to retire as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:48.320
Chief Justice and leave Mega City on his long walk&nbsp;
into the Cursed Earth. Before he resigns, Fargo&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:53.280
asks the Justice Council to commute Dredd's death&nbsp;
sentence and send him to the Aspen Penal Colony&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:59.118
for life. The council agrees, Fargo leaves Mega&nbsp;
City in honor and Griffin becomes Chief Justice.

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.840
Later, when Griffin returns to his&nbsp;
office, he is confronted by Rico,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:11.600
who demands access to a project called "Janus".&nbsp;
Griffin tells Rico that there must be a demand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:16.240
for the project to be implemented; violent&nbsp;
crime must engulf the city for Griffin to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:21.680
convince the Justice Council to re-institute&nbsp;
Janus. Rico promises to do just that.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.280
Dredd is put on to a shuttle going to Aspen;&nbsp;
seated next to him is Fergee. (Seated around them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:34.720
are several criminals who were sentenced by Dredd&nbsp;
himself.) Dredd and Fergee argue briefly about how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:40.400
Dredd unfairly re-convicted Fergee; Dredd claims&nbsp;
"the law doesn't make mistakes" and Fergee asks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:46.160
Dredd to explain how the judge became convicted&nbsp;
himself. Just then, another con on the shuttle&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:51.440
attacks Dredd. On the ground, the Angel Family,&nbsp;
religious fanatics and pirates of the Cursed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:56.800
Earth, blast the shuttle out of the sky with a&nbsp;
rocket launcher. In the ensuing chaos, the pilots&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:02.284
of the shuttle are killed. Dredd and Fergee are&nbsp;
the only survivors and are captured by the Angels.

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:09.200
In her apartment,Hershey conducts her&nbsp;
own investigation of Dredd's conviction&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:12.764
but quickly find herself locked&nbsp;
out of Central's online system.

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:21.360
In the Angel Family's lair, Dredd identifies them&nbsp;
as pirates and scavengers. Fergee, in an attempt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:25.920
to escape their clutches, suddenly proclaims&nbsp;
himself a believer in the Angel's religion&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:31.360
and is let go. Dredd then reveals the Angel's&nbsp;
darkest secret; they are cannibals and plan to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:36.800
eat Fergee in sacrifice. Dredd frees himself&nbsp;
and is immediately attacked by the Angels,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:42.000
whom he takes out one at a time. When Pa Angel&nbsp;
attacks Dredd, he is shot dead by one of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.880
salvage team sent by Chief Justice Griffin&nbsp;
himself to investigate the shuttle crash.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:52.080
The two salvage men prepare to execute Dredd&nbsp;
when they are shot dead by Chief Justice Fargo,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:57.120
who'd found the crash site. Fargo himself&nbsp;
is critically wounded by Mean Machine Angel,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:01.680
whom Dredd had knocked out moments before.&nbsp;
Dredd fights Mean and electrocutes him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:05.600
citing a violation of the Mega City&nbsp;
code for illegal use of electricity.

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:12.240
Hershey consults a promising cadet,&nbsp;
Ohlmeyer, about a photo she'd found&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:17.713
of Dredd as an infant with his parents. Ohlmeyer&nbsp;
quickly determines that the photo is a forgery.

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:22.960
As Fargo dies from his wounds&nbsp;
he tells Dredd about Janus,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:27.280
a sophisticated genetics project that tried&nbsp;
to clone children with the best traits of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:32.720
the existing judges in an attempt to create the&nbsp;
perfect Judge. There were two subjects produced,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:38.160
Rico and Dredd himself, who never knew Rico was&nbsp;
his brother. The project was a massive failure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:43.920
with Rico becoming a psychotic monster, judged&nbsp;
by Dredd and sentenced to Aspen for life. Fargo&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:49.164
dies and Dredd vows to return to Mega City and&nbsp;
stop Rico from starting the Janus project again.

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:57.360
Back in Mega City, chaos erupts as Rico, using&nbsp;
his ABC robot, declares war on the Street&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:03.360
Judges. Many are killed and their numbers reach a&nbsp;
critical low point. Hershey detects a power surge&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:08.640
near the Statue of Liberty and moments later is&nbsp;
almost killed when her Lawmaster cycle explodes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:13.040
The Judges Council meets and discusses the&nbsp;
crisis, knowing that they cannot replenish&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:18.240
their ranks quickly enough, even if they conscript&nbsp;
every candidate at the Academy. Griffin suggests&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:23.120
that they unlock the Janus project, which can&nbsp;
produce a fully mature judge in mere hours&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:28.560
(with the technology being more advanced than 20&nbsp;
years before, it's possible to create adult clones&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:33.600
rather than children). Each member of the council&nbsp;
gives their authorization, as does Griffin,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:38.640
however they collectively object when they realize&nbsp;
that the project was already a major failure.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:43.360
Just then, Rico enters the room and murders&nbsp;
the entire council, leaving Griffin alive.

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:50.400
Outside the city walls, Dredd and Fergee are&nbsp;
able to enter the city through a heat vent,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:53.760
barely making it inside. They&nbsp;
enter the Halls of Justice,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:59.520
where Dredd steals a judge's uniform. Dredd finds&nbsp;
the murdered members of the council and Griffin.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:04.560
He also sees Rico but fails to stop&nbsp;
him. Griffin shoots himself in the arm,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:09.600
framing Dredd for the assault and the murder of&nbsp;
the council. When guards move in to arrest Dredd,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:15.564
he flees on a newer model Lawmaster, flying off&nbsp;
with Fergee. After a furious chase, they escape.

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:23.120
Dredd finds Hershey at her apartment and tells&nbsp;
her of Rico's plan. She goes with him to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:28.880
Statue of Liberty where Rico has already started&nbsp;
the Janus project. When Griffin objects to Rico&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:34.855
replacing the old DNA samples with his own,&nbsp;
Rico has the ABC robot dismember him alive.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:42.160
When Dredd, Hershey and Fergee try to enter&nbsp;
the lab, Rico has the robot shoot Fergee and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:46.720
seize Hershey. With Rico threatening to have&nbsp;
Hershey killed, Dredd agrees to listen to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:52.000
Rico explain his plan to create a super race&nbsp;
of judges that will do only their bidding.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.600
Dredd naturally refuses to join Rico and they&nbsp;
battle hand-to-hand. Fergee distracts the ABC&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:02.640
robot long enough to disable it and Hershey&nbsp;
fights with Rico's assistant, Ilsa Hayden,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:07.760
chief scientist of the Janus project. Rico&nbsp;
finally corners Dredd where he hangs above&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:13.280
the city. Rico tells Dredd that his judgement&nbsp;
is death for betraying Rico years before.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:17.520
Dredd is able to distract Rico with a&nbsp;
flare from his Lawgiver and pulls Rico&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:22.638
over the edge where he falls to his death.&nbsp;
Hershey finds Dredd and helps him to safety.

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:29.840
On the street, Dredd is greeted as a hero.&nbsp;
When asked if he'd like to take the position&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:34.181
of Chief Justice, he refuses, saying&nbsp;
he would rather remain a Street Judge.

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:41.200
