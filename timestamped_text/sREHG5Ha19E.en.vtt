00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:05.360
this is the ultimate death match you're&nbsp;
trapped on an abandoned island forced&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:10.000
to fight against your frights the only way&nbsp;
you're escaping is killing everyone you meet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.920
what do you do when you can be blown up at&nbsp;
any time and you must choose to either die&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.520
or kill all your friends i'm going to&nbsp;
break down the mistakes made explain&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.120
what you should do and how to beat the&nbsp;
government's death game in battle royale&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.640
this class of high school students are living&nbsp;
the last free moments of their lives none of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.360
them have any idea that they've been selected for&nbsp;
this year's battle royale a government-sponsored&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.160
program where every year a class of students is&nbsp;
selected to fight to the death but it's too late&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.040
for them to do anything about it shuya here&nbsp;
wakes up in a dark classroom with a high-tech&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:48.480
calder locked to his neck okay permission to&nbsp;
freak out now groggy or not we need to realize&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.560
something important this took a lot of planning&nbsp;
deception military involvement remote locations&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:59.040
and coordination with the government so the&nbsp;
biggest mistake we can make is to think we have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.920
any control over what happens next these callers&nbsp;
are enough for me to realize that attempting to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.800
escape won't work and could just get us killed&nbsp;
so if it's me i'm hiding in the back of the room&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.680
until we know more about the situation the more&nbsp;
information we have the better decisions we can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.280
make their old teacher mr kitano suddenly arrives&nbsp;
in the classroom with a fully armed military&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.320
escort and he introduces them to the battle royale&nbsp;
a death match designed for rebellious students of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.800
japan they watch a video that explains the rules&nbsp;
they've been brought to an abandoned island which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.960
has been divided into quadrants and danger zones&nbsp;
that change daily and if there isn't a single&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:40.640
winner by the end of three days everyone dies okay&nbsp;
this is life or death we have valuable information&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.200
here and if we memorize this information to build&nbsp;
a strategy before even leaving the classroom we'll&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.160
have a better chance of surviving by far this&nbsp;
place has mountains cliffs valleys and i would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.880
be analyzing which areas would give you&nbsp;
the best geographic advantage personally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.880
i would start in a low-lying valley that has good&nbsp;
force coverage to hide in run off water from the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.440
mountain to drink and flat terrain for easier&nbsp;
travel suddenly the teacher spots one of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:08.080
students whispering and kills her with a throwing&nbsp;
knife if there was any doubt where this was going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.960
now there's no question the students freak out and&nbsp;
try to escape as the soldiers block off the exit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:18.320
but the teacher isn't finished a soldier grabs&nbsp;
one of the kids and remotely triggers his collar&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:24.800
causing it to explode it's absolutely terrifying&nbsp;
but this is actually the best news so far tonight&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.640
because this teacher has just revealed a&nbsp;
huge flaw with the caller since these can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.440
be exploded anywhere on the island remotely we&nbsp;
can assume these devices use either radio or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:39.040
microwave frequencies and the good news is these&nbsp;
frequencies can be blocked radial microwaves are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.840
extremely sensitive to interference of metal&nbsp;
objects and if we find aluminum foil in any of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.520
these abandoned buildings on the island we can&nbsp;
wrap it around the front of the collar to block&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.640
the frequency and take it off each student is&nbsp;
caught up by their number one by one taking a rush&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.120
like a random supplies before leaving the class&nbsp;
but there are two students that stand out among&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.920
the rest the bandana wearing transfer student is&nbsp;
very focused getting out of the room as quickly as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.880
possible while the other transfer student is way&nbsp;
too relaxed about this death match these two civil&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.760
reactions tell me all they need to know that i do&nbsp;
not want to mess with them but they both just made&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.880
the same mistake as the rest everyone is running&nbsp;
through the door without even checking their bag&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.440
i just know if i was the first to leave i would be&nbsp;
waiting outside behind a walruy bush and killing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.360
every student before they even have the time to&nbsp;
reach for their weapons so if i'm not the first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:30.000
one out the door i'm opening my bag inside&nbsp;
the room to get my weapon out before leaving&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.840
finally shuya here is called up running out of the&nbsp;
class and right into a bush to hide very brave he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.560
immediately realizes the gains have begun as a&nbsp;
student appears with a bolt lodged in her throat&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.640
and her killer running towards them he sees his&nbsp;
friend naruko and runs away with her leaving the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.520
killer behind as he falls down the hill escaping&nbsp;
the madness the two take shelter in some caves&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:55.200
where they check their rucksacks to find they have&nbsp;
no weapons only a pot lid and a pair of binoculars&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.480
this is completely unfair it's important&nbsp;
to safely assess what you have in your bag&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.880
as soon as you can because it could completely&nbsp;
change your strategy for survival if you're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:09.040
stuck with useless weapons you need to find&nbsp;
something better we could scavenge weapons from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:14.160
dead students but if you're found carrying only a&nbsp;
pot lid you're screwed at this point nature is our&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.560
best weapon take a sock off and put rocks aside&nbsp;
giving you a hard-hitting close-range weapon and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.040
in the other hand a loose rock to throw out any&nbsp;
uncommon threats using these i would go scouting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:27.120
for a better weapon after the sun rises once&nbsp;
the students have had time to spread further out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.920
leaving the dead bodies behind to scavenge in the&nbsp;
northern end of the island a gang has a transfer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:36.800
student surrounded as he discovers his weapon&nbsp;
is a paper fan that's even worse than a pot lid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.200
they all think he's harmless until he distracts&nbsp;
one of the students steals his gun and kills them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:46.400
all in seconds he takes all their gear including&nbsp;
a revolver and some hand grenades before leaving&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:51.360
this is the most dangerous kid on the island&nbsp;
now if it wasn't for his lightning-fast reflexes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.760
these guys could have easily taken him out teaming&nbsp;
up and outnumbering your classmates to kill might&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.840
seem like a better strategy but it becomes a lot&nbsp;
more risky in the long term because every member&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.160
of the group is extremely vulnerable to betrayal&nbsp;
it's a trade-off some might be willing to make but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.960
there's more to consider large groups are noisier&nbsp;
they're easier to track and they require more food&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:14.080
and water so any resources found must be shared&nbsp;
or else there will be infighting ultimately it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:19.120
fool's gold stay away from this idea and hunt&nbsp;
alone a girl is hiding in an abandoned shed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.520
looking at photos when someone comes in if you&nbsp;
see someone trying their flashlight like this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:28.480
don't trust them mitsco here is one of the meanest&nbsp;
girls on the island and she's going to have one of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:33.600
the highest body counts of anyone starting with&nbsp;
this girl here now some are cut out for this kind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:39.440
of scenario and some are not these four have off&nbsp;
themselves as soon as the games start this is a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:43.680
sad waste of life but i'm not crying because&nbsp;
there's four less people to kill and they've&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:48.640
handed us an amazing opportunity they're callers&nbsp;
because i can learn more about what's possible&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:53.840
about risking my own life i'd also test if any&nbsp;
metal i find will block the radio waves or not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:59.200
if it works on theirs it will work on my two and&nbsp;
i can break it off and hide until everyone is dead&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:03.520
early the next morning the teacher announces who's&nbsp;
been killed and where the danger zones are these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:07.520
two are currently standing at one of them and&nbsp;
they've got an hour to leave or else they're dead&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:11.840
they want to force us to move so we don't hide and&nbsp;
stagnate the death game but i would counter this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:16.560
by lining myself up on the intersection of four&nbsp;
grits so while everyone else is scrambling to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:20.800
escape the zones i barely have to move or venture&nbsp;
far away from a hidey hole that i would set up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:26.000
nearby it can make better use of my time setting&nbsp;
up traps alarms or gathering more resources&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.080
they walk through the forest and get attacked by&nbsp;
a hatchet wielding student shuya here wrestles&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:34.640
with him and ends up in a fight cleverly using&nbsp;
his pot lid as a shield but in their scuffle the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:40.000
hatchet lodges itself in the other kid's head and&nbsp;
he dies this guy has the right idea but he made&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.800
two mistakes right away first if you're going&nbsp;
to ambush someone don't jump into their faces&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:48.880
it's just dumb the whole point of an ambush is&nbsp;
to attack when they're in a bad position to fight&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:53.680
back or deflect i would have waited for them to&nbsp;
pass and attack them from behind the second thing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:57.840
he did wrong was hiding in something that's noisy&nbsp;
these people are already on high alert and you're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:01.760
giving them advanced warning please russell&nbsp;
so i would have covered the hiding area of mud&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:05.920
because it's silent and still blends in with the&nbsp;
environment that's when the class president comes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:09.520
out of the woods and threatens them with his&nbsp;
gun but their shade from the transfer student&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:14.480
with a bandana appears shooing him full of bug&nbsp;
shot surprisingly he doesn't kill the other two&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:19.440
instead taking the hatchet out of the other kid's&nbsp;
head why did he spare their lives in a death game&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:23.280
but there can only be one winner there's&nbsp;
a lot more to this guy than meets the eye&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:26.960
that's when he hears someone speaking over a&nbsp;
megaphone and the girl finds two students calling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:31.280
for everyone to stop fighting and talk it through&nbsp;
letting everyone know where they are including&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:36.640
the other transfer student who shoots them in the&nbsp;
back man this guy's nasty but these two girls were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:41.760
asking for it they broadcasted their location but&nbsp;
easy kills like this won't come often there are 26&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:46.320
students left to kill and many of them will be in&nbsp;
hiding finding them all will be exhausting unless&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:50.800
you know what they're going to be but a lack of&nbsp;
vital resources will draw them out of hiding i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:55.040
would wait where there's either food clean water&nbsp;
or shelter and stake it out now you can wait for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:59.360
them to come to you and conserve your energy for&nbsp;
killing just like this girl does when she catches&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:04.320
her classmate mitzko unprepared the girl is mad&nbsp;
because mitzko here stole her boyfriend and now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:09.200
she wants revenge she starts beating her to&nbsp;
the floor but gets tased and drops her gut&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:13.040
they both rush in to grab it but she's&nbsp;
faster and chews the other girl in the back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:17.840
it's unfortunate but we're not going to escape&nbsp;
petty high school drama on this island now unless&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:21.840
you're already a terrible person the mind will&nbsp;
be forced to justify the killing as a coping&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:26.800
mechanism for survival and hatred is always&nbsp;
an incredible motivator to rationalize murder&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:30.960
so if someone has a grudge against you you better&nbsp;
believe you're first on their list and they'll be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:35.360
seeking you out i would be paying close attention&nbsp;
every day to the announcement the check of my high&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:39.280
school enemies were still alive because it may&nbsp;
change my planning if i knew someone was coming&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:44.480
specifically for me and me alone trekking across&nbsp;
the island the girl falls unconscious from a fever&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:48.720
the map says there's a clinic nearby and julia&nbsp;
here carries her all the way to this building he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:53.520
doesn't see anyone around but accidentally trips&nbsp;
an alarm the transfer student with a bandana comes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:58.080
out of hiding and lets them inside treating the&nbsp;
girl with the clinic's medicine they got lucky one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:04.480
of the toughest guys in the game is also one of&nbsp;
the nicest or is he okay this is dangerous i don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:09.040
know anything about this guy and just because&nbsp;
he let us in for a rest doesn't mean he won't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:13.840
kill us or use us for his own survival if i&nbsp;
saw someone with a sick girl and a pod lid i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:18.000
would have considered them a threat and could be&nbsp;
more useful alive by keeping watch for enemies or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.320
even as a human shield in combat that's why if&nbsp;
i were them i would take advantage of his trust&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:27.360
make a trade for better weapons shoot him and run&nbsp;
away i'm not here to make more friends i'm here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:31.600
to kill them meanwhile this student finds three&nbsp;
others trying to carry this generator up the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:36.960
stairs and these guys have a pretty high-tech&nbsp;
setup leaking cell phones to this laptop the kid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:41.760
reveals he was given a color tracker as his weapon&nbsp;
which he's using to find other players these guys&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:45.200
didn't know what they're doing and getting&nbsp;
powerful regenerator is smart but it's also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:49.680
going to attract a lot of unwanted attention we&nbsp;
can expect students to gravitate towards shelters&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:53.920
like abandoned buildings factories and lighthouses&nbsp;
both to get out of the weather and also find&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:58.400
students hiding there that you can kill if you're&nbsp;
first to one of these you'll have to defend it and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:02.560
likely for more than one at a time so it's not&nbsp;
the best strategy i would stay outside and build&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:07.600
my own shelter out of mud leaves and branches so&nbsp;
i'm covered from the weather and camouflaged the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:12.000
hacker learns there are microphones in the collars&nbsp;
and that's how the battle royale's administrators&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.200
know what they're up to using his laptop he tells&nbsp;
his friends to find fertilizer pesticide charcoal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:22.560
sulfur and kerosene before he starts coding his&nbsp;
hacking program these soundly strange collection&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:28.720
but together the effects can make an explosive&nbsp;
difference now this is a great idea unfortunately&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:33.360
you still need to find people to use it on bigger&nbsp;
weapons are useful but it's strategy that wins&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:37.040
this death game i would be trying to predict&nbsp;
people's movements since we know they have to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:40.960
leave the danger zones that are announced each&nbsp;
morning the geography and terrain will tell me&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:44.800
their likelihood of movement from one sector to&nbsp;
another they're less likely to climb a mountains&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:48.880
than down and they're more likely to be pushed to&nbsp;
low-lying terrain for water and flat terrain for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:53.600
ease of travel predicting others movements is&nbsp;
a great way to hunt them this is death chests&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:58.640
and we need to be one step ahead meanwhile this&nbsp;
athletic girl gets back to her shelter after a run&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:03.040
and bumps into a student with a crossbow he wants&nbsp;
to get freaky with her but she's not feeling it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:08.560
today with the most brutal move of the game she&nbsp;
stabs him straight in the dick that's one hell of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:14.640
a block but suddenly mitzko appears and shoots her&nbsp;
dead now this brings up an important point these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:18.800
are young high school students many of whom will&nbsp;
die before they've had certain experiences that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:23.360
nobody wants to die without i'm not gonna lie&nbsp;
if i were a girl i would weaponize this desire&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:27.680
against the males for the sake of survival if&nbsp;
she dangled the carrot that boy would have had&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:32.640
the motivation to defend her it's a great lure for&nbsp;
a trap stripping them of all weapons making for an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:37.200
easy kill that night the transfer student reveals&nbsp;
that three years ago he had been the winner of a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:40.880
past battle royale he also tells him that&nbsp;
he knows her way off the island but he can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:45.040
only tell them when the time comes he gives the&nbsp;
other boy a gun and some ammo to convince him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:50.080
he's telling the truth when all of a sudden they&nbsp;
hear gunfire outside outside the clinic the other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:55.520
transfer student quarters another kid and shoots&nbsp;
him except he's wearing a bulletproof vest but the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:55.520 --> 00:12:00.160
guy comes back with a samurai sword and finishes&nbsp;
him off and that's not even the worst thing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:04.000
he does to him the transfer student throws the&nbsp;
kid's head through the window with a grenade&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.640
launched in his mouth and they all run for cover&nbsp;
shuya here leaps out of the window and runs for it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:13.040
leading the psycho student on a foot chase to&nbsp;
the coast with nowhere to run he throws himself&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:17.840
into the sea moments before the other student&nbsp;
catches up and blasts the water with gunfire&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:22.800
okay this seems like a terrible idea because you&nbsp;
can evade bolts well in water but it's actually&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:27.600
the best move you can make when a bull hits the&nbsp;
water it slows down due to drag and even veers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:32.160
off target in the case of heavy caliber ammo the&nbsp;
bolt will decelerate so fast in the water that it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:37.120
shatters into pieces you can be as close as three&nbsp;
feet below the surface and you're totally safe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:40.960
it's the second day and he's woken up by a girl&nbsp;
who tells him four more students have died and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:44.880
that his friend the hacker is waiting for him&nbsp;
in the west the girls downstairs are getting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:49.680
lunch ready but one of them is very uncomfortable&nbsp;
with the boy's presence and decides to poison him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:54.160
and that's when things go wrong another girl&nbsp;
eats the poisoned spaghetti shocking everyone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:57.920
when she suddenly dies they freak out and&nbsp;
start accusing each other grab their guns&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:02.480
and start firing killing everyone in the room&nbsp;
the boy runs down to find six more dead and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:07.920
lunch is ruined okay this is a great example&nbsp;
of how a group collaboration can go all wrong&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:12.880
even if it's all smiles rainbows these girls do&nbsp;
not trust each other and all it takes is one ounce&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:17.120
of suspicion to throw everyone out of control if&nbsp;
you're going to kill your homies kill them all at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:22.240
the same time in their sleep so no one can alert&nbsp;
the others of your betrayal shuya meets up with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:26.880
the other two deciding to make the long journey&nbsp;
west to meet the hacker they're injured exhausted&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:32.320
and need for the water but they press on okay now&nbsp;
students aren't the only killers nature can be a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:38.640
harsh mistress too they're exposed to heat stroke&nbsp;
dehydration dysentery hunger and blood loss bees&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:43.040
are all killers in the wilderness if not taken&nbsp;
care of quickly food can be found from fruit trees&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:47.600
berries and mushrooms but only if you know what to&nbsp;
look for but that's not even your biggest problem&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:51.920
this is an island and it's hot and mountainous&nbsp;
trekking across this place will make you sweat&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:56.720
profusely and you'll need water very quickly now&nbsp;
most of what makes water dangerous isn't divisible&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:01.280
rain can create dirty runoff and eutrophication&nbsp;
and dead animals upstream can affect the water the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:06.400
best way to tell is to look for animal tracks bugs&nbsp;
and green vegetation nearby if other living things&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:10.800
are drinking from it you probably can too the&nbsp;
best place to look is in valleys and low points&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:15.760
because water always runs downwards then follow&nbsp;
it upstream to get the cleanest water possible&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:19.920
another option is to make a solar still by digging&nbsp;
a hole in the ground putting a clear sheet over&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:24.000
the hole the sun will evaporate the groundwater&nbsp;
causing condensation in the sheet and you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.160
collect it from the center as it drips into your&nbsp;
cup you get less than it takes longer but it will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:32.880
be cleaner than running water the kid with the&nbsp;
gps tracker arrives at an abandoned warehouse&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:37.760
looking for his high school crush but the girl&nbsp;
empties her gun on it regretfully she only finds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:41.440
out afterwards that he came to save her she could&nbsp;
have really used that extra protection because the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:46.320
mitsco here sneaks up and guns her down and the&nbsp;
death cycle continues as she's suddenly attacked&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:51.200
and killed by the psycho transfer student across&nbsp;
the island the hacker finalizes the code to his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:55.200
hacking program while his true friends mix&nbsp;
the chemicals they gathered to create bombs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:59.520
impressively resourceful they activate the&nbsp;
software and sabotage the computers of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:04.320
battle royale administrators and for a brief&nbsp;
moment there's no gps tracking and no color&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:09.120
activation for any student the only way for&nbsp;
the administrators to stop it is to pull the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:15.280
hard reset okay this is a big deal it proved that&nbsp;
cheating is actually a viable option at beating&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:19.440
this game and that there's a scenario here&nbsp;
where our real survival depends on defeating&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:25.040
the teachers not our fellow students it's time&nbsp;
to start strategizing against the game itself&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:29.200
now we know that the colors are triggered by wave&nbsp;
frequencies and we're on an island then there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:33.600
must be a local antenna to transmit the signals&nbsp;
through gps tracking works by emitting microwave&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:38.240
signals that go through these relays to reach the&nbsp;
satellites above these waves pass through nearly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:42.640
everything except for metal which reflects the&nbsp;
signal destroying the antennas receiver won't just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:47.600
notify your own color but everyone's color on the&nbsp;
island this gives us the chance to work together&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:52.320
for our collected survival it totally eliminates&nbsp;
the need to kill each other and if that happens we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:56.720
can focus on the real enemy the government the&nbsp;
students begin loading their gear into a truck&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:56.720 --> 00:16:01.040
intent on running the school with explosives but&nbsp;
just as they're about to leave they get attacked&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:06.000
by the one and only psycho transfer student he&nbsp;
kills them and sets out the bombs in the truck&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.800
the last two survivors arrive they see the&nbsp;
psycho student is still alive kawada here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:16.800
finishes him off with a shot to the caller blowing&nbsp;
him into smithereens okay this is awkward because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:21.760
now there's no bad guy and there can only be one&nbsp;
winner it's time to start planning your friend's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:26.480
deaths there's no doubt that all three have the&nbsp;
same thoughts but no one will openly admit it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:30.080
because it will scatter them making them harder&nbsp;
to kill and you might not find them before the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:34.880
time runs out and everyone is dead if it's&nbsp;
me i'm suggesting we make a temporary pact&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:39.680
to discard all weapons but we discuss what to do&nbsp;
with conceal a knife or a rope the ploy forces&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:43.920
all three people to pretend to be friends for as&nbsp;
long as possible while you disarm them which makes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:48.480
them more vulnerable to kill it's the final day&nbsp;
they head to the coast of the transfer student's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:54.240
escape route but he reveals it was all a lie&nbsp;
they are his ticket out and he shoots them both&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:59.760
making him this year's winner of the battle royale&nbsp;
cold-blooded later he reunites with the teacher&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:03.920
back at the school who discovers that the kid's&nbsp;
color has somehow been deactivated and that he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:09.520
didn't shoot the other students it was a trick and&nbsp;
the boy shows the teacher dead it's finally over&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:14.000
as the three students throw away their explosive&nbsp;
collars and relax their friend kawana dies on his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.760
way back to the mainland and the other two are&nbsp;
declared wanted fugitives with the government&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:31.360
they might have beaten the battle&nbsp;
royale but they can't escape the law
