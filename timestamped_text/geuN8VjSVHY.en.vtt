00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:02.170
Welcome to Moviecaps.

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:07.779
Today I will show you a Mystery, Thriller
film from 2009, titled Exam.

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:09.179
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.340
Watch out and take care.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.370
Eight candidates for a top job at a mysterious
company are gathered in a windowless room

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:17.200
with two rows of desks.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.140
They have passed previous requirements not
mentioned in the film.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:25.060
They each choose a seat and upon each desk
is a piece of paper that identifies them as

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.860
"Candidate 1", "Candidate 2", etc.

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.670
The invigilator arrives and sets forth the
rules for the test.

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:36.150
The test consists of answering one question
and that there is only one answer.

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.430
Inside the room, there will be no laws other
than what the company permits, as such.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.670
The candidates cannot try to communicate with
the invigilator himself nor the guard.

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.180
They cannot spoil the paper, and they cannot
leave the room for any reason.

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.810
If they break any of the rules, they will
be disqualified.

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:55.239
The invigilator asks the candidates whether
they have any questions.

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:59.040
He sets the clock at 80 minutes and leaves
the room.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.690
Once alone, the candidates turn their paper
over and find nothing written on the back.

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.521
They look at each other in confusion, and
one of the candidates starts writing, "I believe

00:01:07.521 --> 00:01:08.729
I deserve..."

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:15.119
The guard throws her out of the room because
she has written on her paper, spoiling it.

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.170
A young white man starts talking and convinces
everyone to work together until they find

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.990
what the question is.

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.140
Arguing that for a job this elite, the answer
can’t be simple.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:25.729
It takes teamwork.

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:31.539
He also gives insulting names to the candidates
according to their physical appearance, Black.

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:32.779
White.

00:01:32.779 --> 00:01:34.020
Brown.

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.259
Blonde.

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:36.499
Brunette.

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:37.740
Dark.

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:38.740
Deaf

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.750
Then White thinks, what else hasn’t the
invigilator forbidden them to do.

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.209
He stands up.

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:46.520
Guard only acts when the rules are broken.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.630
Thus they are sure now that things unspoken
by the invigilator are all allowed.

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.560
At first, they try to read a hidden message
in the papers by placing them in front of

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.609
a light.

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:58.960
That doesn’t reveal anything on the paper.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.700
When they break the lights that surround the
room, emergency lights come on.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.579
When they carefully break the emergency tubes,
they find infrared light.

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:10.140
None of this helps them to see anything on
the paper.

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.989
They further discover that neither one will
be disqualified if a candidate spoils another

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:15.659
candidate's paper.

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:19.549
When Dark tries to tell that they are probably
missing something obvious, White dismisses

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:21.129
her instantly.

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:23.040
They try licking the paper.

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.629
White urinates on his but finds nothing.

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:28.159
White picks on Deaf who speaks only French.

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:31.400
Deaf displays symptoms of a mental or nervous
disorder.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.209
He says in French that they only have to look
at the papers while he tries to re-order some

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:38.209
small pieces of glass on top of the paper.

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:42.069
They discover that Brown is a professional
gambler, and he suggests it’s a game, that

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:46.049
the board of directors is hidden on the other
side of the wall betting on who'll win.

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:49.780
Dark is a psychoanalyst who seems to be the
only one who has some information about the

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.700
company, the products it sells, its expansion,
etc.

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.750
Still, none of the other candidates could
find any info on the company despite doing

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.049
some research.

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:03.299
Dark tells them that the company they all
applied to, worst job position beats any best

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:04.710
job position in the world.

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:08.590
It’s a company that expanded on some kind
of pandemic outbreak.

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.079
They found the suppressants for the infection.

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:15.799
CEO of this company is considered one of the
most influential people in the world.

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:18.530
White takes charge of the group as a de-facto
leader.

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.220
Brunette discovers they can touch the guard
as long as they don't talk to him.

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.640
She finds a lighter in one of his pockets.

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.680
She wants to set off the fire alarms because
it may produce something other than water,

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.170
revealing a photograph that shows the question.

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.360
She jumps onto a table but still cannot reach
the sprinkler.

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.999
White offers her a paper, and after succeeding,
she discovers that White gave her her own

00:03:38.999 --> 00:03:43.060
paper, so she is disqualified and escorted
out of the room.

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.049
Black walks towards White furiously, saying,
“I should punch your lights out.”

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:51.989
The room goes dark, Brown says, “lights
up.” and the light goes on.

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:55.420
They discover its voice-activated.

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.329
White bullies Deaf into tearing the paper
and eating it.

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:01.290
After following his instructions, Deaf crawls
away.

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.060
The guard puts Deaf out, dropping his glasses
inside the room.

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.609
White deceived them by saying the group could
collaborate until they guessed, but after

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:13.180
tricking Brunette into being disqualified,
each one began to mistrust the others.

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.410
As the tension builds to greater levels, Black
punches White knocking him out, and ends up

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.200
tied to a chair by Black and Brown.

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:25.260
White starts convulsing and is unable to find
his medication, which is required every hour.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.570
Then they understand that White is infected.

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.110
Dark suggests that White is probably a spy
for the company.

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:35.110
Brown points out that Dark knows an awful
lot about a company, and everyone starts to

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.730
suspect Dark’s the spy within the company
and is working for them, and they want to

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:41.100
get the question out from her with torture.

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.970
When Brown is going to torture her by cutting
her with a piece of paper, they discover that

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:47.510
she is an employee at this establishment.

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:51.390
Also that she has self-hurt on one of her
thighs before, Brown cuts her tight.

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:53.100
Next would be her eye.

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:58.440
She still yells that she doesn’t know anything,
and Brown trusts her.

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:02.320
White is getting worse, and while everyone
else is trying to decide the best way to help,

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:06.160
Dark discovers that Brown stole White's pill
and stuck it under his desk with a piece of

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.380
chewing gum.

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:12.130
Brown still disagrees about giving White the
drug and slaps it out of her hand.

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:14.470
It falls down a water drain.

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:19.190
Dark turns toward the blank screen and pleads
for Whites’ life and is thereby disqualified.

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:23.140
Blonde takes the pill out with her hair clip
and forces the medicine into White's mouth,

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:26.170
and he gets well almost immediately, they
free him.

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:30.020
He points out that the clock is running low,
and there are four left.

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.060
White believes only one can win.

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:35.380
He and Black begin arguing and race to get
the guard's gun.

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:39.570
After pummeling White to the wall, Black takes
the gun and, after being provoked, allegedly

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:42.960
shoots white, but they discover the gun didn't
actually fire.

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.200
They start to fight.

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:49.420
White stabs Black with a pencil and gains
possession of the firearm, and tries to shoot

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:52.190
Black, but the gun doesn't shoot once again.

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:55.830
White figures out that the guard may only
shoot the gun, so he puts the gun into the

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:57.290
guard's hand.

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:00.160
White threatens everybody that they must leave
or be killed.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.940
Brown leaves valuing his life.

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:07.100
Blonde leaves and shouts "lights out" to allow
Black to win.

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.060
In the dark, White kills Black.

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:12.500
Blonde has not entirely left the room.

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:15.190
One of her feet remains partially in the room.

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:19.440
White sees this and wants to shoot her, then
suddenly the clock starts blaring, signaling

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.210
that the time has run out.

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:24.090
White shouts to the other side of the wall
that he's won.

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:27.830
Guard puts his hand on Whites’ shoulder
and shows him there is still time left.

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:32.080
He loses because Deaf has adjusted the clock
so that the 80-minute time slot has not yet

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:33.090
expired.

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:35.060
He tries to commit suicide.

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:39.860
He fails because, as recalled, the gun will
only work in the guards’ hands.

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:44.110
The glass wall is turned on, and White can
see the silhouette of the invigilator.

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:47.090
He looks crushed and realizes that it has
all been futile.

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:49.930
The guard disqualifies him by leading him
out.

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:53.180
Blonde fully enters the room again and picks
up her paper.

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:56.970
She fumbles with the pieces of glass and Deaf's
glasses and reads "Question 1" written on

00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:59.430
the paper’s watermark in tiny print.

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:03.650
She offers it to the Deaf, who returns to
the room, and she says "no,” answering the

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:06.510
question put forth, "Are there any questions?".

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:08.160
She is offered the job.

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:11.160
She is explained that Deaf is the CEO of the
company.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:15.280
He is a troubled but genius scientist who
has discovered a pill to heal wounds incredibly

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:16.490
fast.

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:19.220
Blonde says that she may not accept the job.

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:22.760
When the invigilator points to why she went
through all that trouble if she didn't want

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:27.100
the position, she points to Black lying on
the floor and says it's unacceptable.

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:30.310
The invigilator asks, "Who told you that he's
dead?".

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:33.870
She approaches Black and sees that the bullet
wound is almost healed.

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:38.010
The invigilator says that they put the fast-healing
pill inside the bullet.

00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:41.700
They own the formula for the medicine, which
also healed Black’s illness, but it can

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:44.440
only be manufactured in minimal quantities.

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:50.240
The new director needed to have sympathy alongside
ambition, intelligence, drive, and hard work.

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:53.970
Blonde accepts the job right away.

00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:55.550
Thank you for watching!
