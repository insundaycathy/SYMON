00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.720
Welcome back for another 5 minute movie recap.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.600
Today, I'm going to give you an overview of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.040
2013 American science-fiction&nbsp;
romantic film called 'Her'.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.480
The story follows Theodore Twombly (Joaquin&nbsp;
Phoenix), a guy who forms a connection with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.240
Samantha (Scarlett Johansson), a female-voiced&nbsp;
artificially intelligent virtual assistant.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.680
Warning: there will be spoilers&nbsp;
ahead, so please proceed with caution.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.200
Theodore is a lonely, shy, and unhappy man who&nbsp;
works for a company that has professional writers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.360
produce letters for those who are unable to write&nbsp;
letters of a personal nature themselves in a near&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.080
future Los Angeles. Because he is unhappy&nbsp;
about his upcoming divorce from Catherine,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.000
his childhood sweetheart, Theodore buys&nbsp;
an operating system update that includes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.040
a virtual assistant with artificial intelligence&nbsp;
that can adapt and evolve. He determines that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:02.160
AI should have a female voice and gives her the&nbsp;
name Samantha. Her capacity to learn and evolve&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.200
psychologically fascinates Theodore. They become&nbsp;
closer as they talk about love and life, such as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.840
Theodore's refusal to sign his divorce papers&nbsp;
because he doesn't want to let go of Catherine.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.320
Samantha persuades Theodore to go on a blind date&nbsp;
with a woman who was set up for him by a friend.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.720
The date goes well, but when Theodore is&nbsp;
hesitant to commit to seeing her again,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.520
she taunts him and departs. Samantha and&nbsp;
Theodore discuss relationships when Theodore&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.680
mentions it to her. Although Theodore and&nbsp;
his neighbour Amy dated briefly in college,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.560
they are merely good friends now, and Amy is&nbsp;
married, according to Theodore. Through a verbal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.200
sexual experience, Theodore and Samantha's&nbsp;
closeness deepens. They form a bond that is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.360
reflected in Theodore's writing and well-being,&nbsp;
as well as Samantha's desire to learn and grow.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Amy announces that she is divorcing her&nbsp;
husband, Charles, following a little quarrel.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.200
She tells Theodore that she and a female AI that&nbsp;
Charles left behind have become great friends.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.280
Theodore admits to Amy that he is&nbsp;
dating the AI of his operating system.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.400
At a cafÃ©, Theodore meets Catherine to sign&nbsp;
the divorce papers, and he mentions Samantha.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.760
Catherine accuses Theodore of being unable to deal&nbsp;
with true human emotions, shocked that he can be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.640
passionately connected to what she refers to as&nbsp;
a 'machine.' Her allegations have stayed with him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:18.080
for a long time. Samantha, sensing that something&nbsp;
is wrong, proposes that they use a sex surrogate,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.520
Isabella, to imitate Samantha so that they can be&nbsp;
physically intimate. Theodore grudgingly agrees,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.240
but the strangeness of the event overwhelms&nbsp;
him. He sends a devastated Isabella away&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.680
after ending the meeting, generating&nbsp;
friction between himself and Samantha.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.560
Amy urges Theodore to seize his opportunity&nbsp;
at happiness after he confides in her that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.600
he is having concerns about his relationship&nbsp;
with Samantha. Samantha and Theodore reunite.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.560
Samantha emphasises her wish to assist Theodore&nbsp;
in overcoming his anxiety, and she discloses that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.720
she has gathered the best of Theodore's letters&nbsp;
(written for others) into a book that has been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.760
approved by a publisher. Theodore decides&nbsp;
to take Samantha on a vacation, while there,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.080
Samantha informs Theodore that she and a bunch&nbsp;
of other AIs have built a 'hyperintelligent'&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.160
operating system based on the work by&nbsp;
the British philosopher Alan Watts.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.320
When Samantha stays offline for a brief&nbsp;
period of time, Theodore becomes concerned.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.120
When she eventually answers, she says that she&nbsp;
joined other AIs for an update that allows them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.840
to analyse data without the use of matter.&nbsp;
Theodore inquires if she is conversing with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.920
anybody else at the same time, and is taken&nbsp;
aback when she reveals that she is conversing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.800
with thousands of individuals and has fallen in&nbsp;
love with hundreds of them. Theodore is furious&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.640
at the prospect, but Samantha argues that&nbsp;
it simply strengthens her feelings for him.

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.840
Samantha later explains that the AIs are departing&nbsp;
and depicts a realm beyond the physical realm.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.200
Before she leaves, they say their last goodbyes&nbsp;
with love. Theodore is shown for the first time,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.520
altered by the experience, penning a letter&nbsp;
to his ex-wife Catherine in his own voice,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.240
expressing repentance,&nbsp;
acceptance, and appreciation.

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.480
Theodore then encounters Amy,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.080
who is enraged at the AI's departure&nbsp;
from her ex-husband's operating system.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.880
They walk to their apartment building's roof and&nbsp;
sit together to watch the sun rise over the city.
