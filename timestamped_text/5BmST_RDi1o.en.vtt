00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:05.759
If you walked into a cursed house and vengeful
spirits started preying upon you, what would

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:06.759
you do?

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:10.679
In this How to Beat video, we’ll follow
the characters, see if we can make better

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.749
decisions, and ultimately attempt to beat
the CURSED ONRYO in, THE GRUDGE.

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:19.580
If you think you have a better way to beat
the ONRYO, let me know in the comments!

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.259

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:26.220
Before we start following the characters,
we’re warned by some dark exposition about

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.480
the Ju-On curse.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.580
That, when someone dies in the grip of a powerful
rage...

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.220
A curse is born.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.520
The curse gathers in that place of death,
and those who encounter it will be consumed

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.520
by its fury.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.079
It’s a great bedtime story for your children.

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.530
What about the victims of the onryo.

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:46.519
They are all suffering immensely, and dying
in the grip of the onryo’s powerful rage.

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:51.220
Wouldn’t this in effect, cause the spread
of the Ju-On grudge curse like a virus.

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:55.429
It would be an unstoppable pandemic that would
cause the human race to go extinct and the

00:00:55.429 --> 00:00:57.559
Earth to become inhospitable.

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:00.920
What about any other situation where someone
was brutally murdered.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.190
If you just open a history book and flip to
any page, or turn on the news you pretty much

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.300
can’t avoid reading about horrific atrocities
committed between humans.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.770
This curse would be an extinction level threat
that humans would be battling everywhere,

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:14.770
all the time.

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:16.400
We start out following a disturbed looking
man.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.650
I know Monday mornings can be hard, but come
on.

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:20.610
I’m guessing he visited the home, started
getting haunted by the onryo, and thought,

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:21.740
fuck it i’m going out on my terms.

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:22.870
I get it.

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:24.990
But your apartment wasn’t that high up.

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.820
Suicide by falling isn’t something you want
to mess up.

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.070
According to a book called Trauma Anesthesia,
50% of people will die from a 4 story fall,

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.820
and 90% from a 7 story fall.

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.760
We later see that his apartment was on the
6th floor.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.450
So about 80% chance he dies.

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.190
Might as well take the elevator up to the
roof to guarantee you go out instantly.

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.640
Yoko, the expendable caretaker, is helping
an elderly lady named Emma.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.440
During her cleaning routine, she hears some
creaking of the wood floors in the adjacent

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:51.440
room.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.680
Of course she decides to check it out, only
to find nobody there.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.960
Houses do make random noises though.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.100
My parents' house has air currents that would
pull the basement door shut on it’s own.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.680
At least I'm pretty sure it was air currents.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.350
I never took any chances, as soon as I turned
the basement lights off, I'd animal crawl

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.680
up the stairs as fast as possible before shutting
and locking the door.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.630
One creaking sound, ok, but 3 distinct sounds
that are directionally baiting you into a

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.909
trap.

00:02:20.909 --> 00:03:24.370
Yoko is like a little kid following the onryo’s
jelly bean trail.

00:03:24.370 --> 00:04:47.660
It’s not as obvious that Yoko was in 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:52.170
danger as much as the first girl in the Polaroid
movie, but still.

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:55.040
Checking out the attic is gonna be a hard
no for me.

00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:00.200
She turns her back to the open entrance that
the weird sound was coming from, because that’s

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.690
smart, then hops in to check the attic out.

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:06.970
If I experienced what she did, I'd have left
the building, and then gotten some backup

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:08.410
to go check it out later.

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:12.100
Not too long ago, a homeless man was found
living in a couple’s attic.

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:18.250
I’m not going to be confronting a potential
situation like that alone.

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:25.450
Yah, Yoko really didn’t stand a chance,
considering she was one of the first to encounter

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:30.031
the onryo and the old lady is mute and can’t
scribble a picture to show Yoko she was in

00:05:30.031 --> 00:05:31.031
danger.

00:05:31.031 --> 00:05:35.700
Our main protagonist, Karen gets to work and
finds out she’s filling in for Yoko, who

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:38.930
didn’t show up for work this morning or
answer her phone.

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:41.500
Like Alex said, she’s probably just sick.

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:46.340
Karen reaches the elderly woman’s house
and finds her writhing on the bedroom floor.

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:51.160
Yah thanks Alex, handling 160 pounds of this
dead weight is easy to do alone.

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:56.080
I’d think it was kind of odd that both floors
of the house were trashed, but the only occupant

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:00.830
is diagnosed with severe lethargy, couldn’t
get out of her own bed, and probably had pissed

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:01.830
herself.

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:06.790
Karen starts getting baited by the onryo fairly
quickly.

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:13.720
And makes the same mistake of following the
metaphorical evil jelly bean trail into the

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:16.380
onryo’s tender unloving embrace.

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:19.470
Seriously, they’re a very touchy feely spirit.

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:22.400
I’d rather get my head whacked off by Jason
Voorhees.

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:29.560
The closet is strangely taped up.

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:41.270
The onryo tricks Karen into coming over to
the closet to help the cat.

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:47.920
Well, she found the cat, and a little boy.

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:51.150
Karen calls her manager, Alex, to see what
she should do.

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:53.680
Seems like a good time to call the cops too.

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:57.870
Karen managed to snag the piss-stained book
from the random creepy kid.

00:06:57.870 --> 00:06:58.870
Priorities.

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:02.580
It seems to be a diary of some sort, and contains
a picture of the jumper.

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:06.520
She continues wandering around the house with
a little boy still upstairs by himself.

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:07.560
Screw Emma, I’d be out of there.

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:11.540
Amidst all the trash, she finds a ripped up
picture containing the image of the little

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:15.210
boy, his cat, and his parents.

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:18.410
Seriously, call the cops, figure out who or
where the parents are.

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:21.030
Karen figures out the boy’s name is Toshio.

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:24.190
The phone rings, it's Susan, Matthew’s sister.

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:27.880
She’s checking in to make sure Emma is okay.

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:32.860
It is Emma’s room, so Karen probably thought
it was just her.

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:35.760
Behind the door she hears Emma murmuring to
something.

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:39.400
Karen opens the door and asks Emma who she
was talking to.

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:43.410
Surprisingly, Emma finally talks, saying that
‘they’ won’t leave her alone.

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:46.250
Karen ignores her and tells her to just get
some rest.

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:49.670
Karen, she was diagnosed with lethargy and
dementia.

00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:54.320
There’s obviously something not right here
with the child, Yoko missing, the picture,

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:55.320
etc.

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:59.480
Emma isn’t psychotic or hallucinatory, it’s
not like she has a preexisting condition that

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:01.650
would cause her to say things like this.

00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:11.840
Maybe ask who she's referring to at least.

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:16.460
The evil onryo spirit confronts Karen, but
it’s not clear if she’s dead yet.

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:20.980
We flashback to the family and Emma originally
buying the house a few days prior.

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:23.490
Emma seems to know something isn’t right.

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:27.750
While the family checks out the house, the
real estate agent hears some dripping sounds

00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:31.420
coming from the bathroom.

00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:36.089
He heads in to check it out, and sees the
tub is filled with dark disgusting water.

00:08:36.089 --> 00:08:40.449
The dripping sounds sounded less like a faucet
dripping, and more like someone splashing

00:08:40.449 --> 00:08:41.839
the water around.

00:08:41.839 --> 00:08:42.839
Odd..

00:08:42.839 --> 00:08:46.550
Since he’s trying to sell the house, he
tries to quickly unclog the drain before the

00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:49.000
family comes downstairs to check it out.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:09:00.449
This movie has successfully made me paranoid
of attics and dark water filled bathtubs.

00:09:00.449 --> 00:09:04.760
I wonder if he’ll mention that to the family.

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:07.480
Nope.

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:12.180
This house would be considered a jiko bukken,
which is a property where the previous occupants

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:14.999
died of unnatural causes, like murder.

00:09:14.999 --> 00:09:20.120
In Japanese law, the real estate agent is
required to inform the buyers of prior incidents.

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:23.860
It wouldn’t really matter though, because
nobody would survive long enough to make it

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:24.860
to court.

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:28.449
I also like how they didn’t give a shit
about Emma’s opinion of the house, considering

00:09:28.449 --> 00:09:43.170
she was visibly disturbed by the place.

00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:44.170
What the fuck Toshio.

00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:49.450
You were supposedly murdered so brutally that
a curse was created with your vengeful spirit

00:09:49.450 --> 00:09:54.360
to terrorize and bring death to whoever is
unlucky enough to walk in that front door.

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:57.930
But you’re running around knocking over
my ramen and eating my Ritz Bitz.

00:09:57.930 --> 00:10:01.490
I think your dad should have held your head
underwater a little longer.

00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:08.420
Jennifer initially blames it on Emma, but
sees footprints leading into another room.

00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:15.370
I’m just trying to imagine seeing footprints
in my house, following them, and running into

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:16.680
a cat and little kid.

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:19.520
It’s a little kid, but I ain’t dealing
with that.

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:25.860
Same procedure as Yoko and Karen, leave, call
cops, wait for Kayako to come kill you anyways.

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:28.959
Jennifer heads upstairs to check it out by
herself.

00:10:28.959 --> 00:10:34.470
Jennifer’s giving the chick from Polaroid
a run for her money in how stupid you can

00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:37.170
be, and succumbs to a similar fate.

00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:40.279
Matthew comes home to find Jen missing and
the house completely trashed.

00:10:40.279 --> 00:10:42.779
I’d think someone broke into my home.

00:10:42.779 --> 00:10:45.019
Same procedure as Yoko, Karen, and Jen.

00:10:45.019 --> 00:10:49.190
Leave, call cops and Jen, wait for Kayako
to come kill you anyways.

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:53.910
Emma is completely shell-shocked, probably
from hearing her daughter-in-law get ravaged

00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:56.290
by evil spirits upstairs.

00:10:56.290 --> 00:10:59.160
Matthew finds Jennifer in bed, also shell
shocked.

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:16.089
She starts croaking and just as Matthew's
about to call an ambulance the onryo attack.

00:11:16.089 --> 00:11:19.959
Clearly they are being attacked by something
supernatural, and nobody so far has had a

00:11:19.959 --> 00:11:22.430
solid opportunity to fight back.

00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:24.769
Matthew and Jen are presumably dead.

00:11:24.769 --> 00:11:27.430
Back from the flashback, Alex shows up to
help Karen.

00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:33.930
Wow these houses are less secure than a Motel
8.

00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:40.860
He finds Emma lying wide awake, oh she’s
dead.

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:42.529
To be fair, it’s kind of hard to tell.

00:11:42.529 --> 00:11:45.180
I don’t think Emma was diagnosed correctly.

00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:48.339
She was clearly suffering from severe PTSD.

00:11:48.339 --> 00:11:51.890
Which they just chalked up to mild dementia
and lethargy.

00:11:51.890 --> 00:11:55.269
Instead of proper therapy and figuring out
what happened to her, they just gave her a

00:11:55.269 --> 00:11:56.399
cleaning lady.

00:11:56.399 --> 00:11:59.990
Alex finds a very PTSD stricken Karen curled
up in the corner.

00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:03.540
I guess the evil spirits haven’t finished
toying with her.

00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:05.699
Finally someone decided to call the cops.

00:12:05.699 --> 00:12:08.990
Alex and the detectives have a disheartening
chat.

00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:13.699
He tells them Yoko’s missing, and they tell
him Emma’s family has been missing as well.

00:12:13.699 --> 00:12:17.879
The detectives then take up the important
task of finding and returning the phone to

00:12:17.879 --> 00:12:18.920
the charging dock.

00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:25.199
The detectives hop into the attic where nothing
good ever happens.

00:12:25.199 --> 00:12:29.950
At least the evil spirits, in their vengeful
rampage, decided to place their victim’s

00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:32.519
corpses in loving embrace, how sweet.

00:12:32.519 --> 00:12:35.249
They also find Yoko’s jaw.

00:12:35.249 --> 00:12:40.089
Doug mentions to Karen that the cops ruled
Emma's death as from natural causes.

00:12:40.089 --> 00:12:44.461
How did the cops rule that, considering there
are 2 corpses and a ripped out jaw in the

00:12:44.461 --> 00:12:50.300
attic, a missing caretaker and former owner
of said jaw, and a PTSD stricken caretaker.

00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:53.529
Yah, I’m sure Emma's death was completely
unrelated.

00:12:53.529 --> 00:12:57.970
I know Karen's pretty shocked, but I think
if I was her I'd be trying to find out who

00:12:57.970 --> 00:13:02.580
that kid was, what happened to his family
in the picture, but more importantly, find

00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:05.600
a Buddhist Priest to take a look at my options.

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:08.040
In the recap we’ll see if that could’ve
helped.

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:19.959
Karen does have some off-hand knowledge of
Buddhist rituals that could help.

00:13:19.959 --> 00:13:24.449
What I'm gathering from this ritual is that
Karen needs to burn the haunted house down,

00:13:24.449 --> 00:13:26.269
and cremate their remains.

00:13:26.269 --> 00:13:30.369
But again, it’s probably wise to check with
the Buddhists first, considering they have

00:13:30.369 --> 00:13:32.370
much more knowledge on these things.

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:35.589
We flash back to Susan, who’s working late
at the office.

00:13:35.589 --> 00:13:40.199
‘Karoshi’, or death from overwork, is
an ongoing issue within Japan’s extreme

00:13:40.199 --> 00:13:45.610
work culture, so I don’t get how she’s
there alone.

00:13:45.610 --> 00:13:54.899
Well, Susan’s dead..

00:13:54.899 --> 00:13:59.019
She makes it into the stairwell and takes
a big sigh of relief because obviously the

00:13:59.019 --> 00:14:01.939
creepy stalker thing couldn’t follow her
in there.

00:14:01.939 --> 00:14:08.130
Mathew calls her cell phone, but it doesn’t
sound like him.

00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:13.250
In case you’re wondering, Kayako’s croaking
was caused by her husband snapping her neck,

00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:14.990
which didn’t initially kill her.

00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:18.000
The croaking is her trying to breathe through
a broken windpipe.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:23.420
The stairwell lights start shutting off above
her, and she sees Kayako crawling up the stairs.

00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:28.069
Just as Susan makes it back out of the stairwell,
Kayako grabs her feather keychain, snapping

00:14:28.069 --> 00:14:29.069
it off.

00:14:29.069 --> 00:14:32.910
Susan makes a break for the security desk
and convinces the security guard to go check

00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:35.060
out the monster on the tenth floor.

00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:37.310
Sure, he gets paid enough to do that.

00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:41.459
She watches on the security camera as the
guard checks it out, all seems good until

00:14:41.459 --> 00:14:44.139
the onryo crawls out of the shadow.

00:14:44.139 --> 00:14:48.649
Not knowing that she was marked by the grudge
curse, she takes a taxi back to her apartment

00:14:48.649 --> 00:14:50.509
thinking she can escape.

00:14:50.509 --> 00:14:55.199
But the onryo has already caught up with Susan,
waiting for her at every floor but the one

00:14:55.199 --> 00:14:56.660
she steps off at.

00:14:56.660 --> 00:15:01.240
She makes it into her apartment, and the phone
rings, maybe it’s actually Matthew this

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:13.830
time?

00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:27.509
That’s not Matthew.

00:15:27.509 --> 00:15:31.980
Not sure why it had to deceive her like that
in order to get her apt, it obviously has

00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:34.019
no problem tracking and following her.

00:15:34.019 --> 00:15:37.899
Through the eye peep it looks like Matthew
is there, but when she opens the door the

00:15:37.899 --> 00:15:42.980
hallways empty.

00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:45.860
Susan runs back inside and jumps under the
covers.

00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:50.480
The nightmare fuel continues as she finds
the feather keychain that the onryo stole

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:51.480
in her bed.

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:56.639
She basically only has enough time to register
that she has seconds before a corpse ghost

00:15:56.639 --> 00:16:02.010
consumes her soul.

00:16:02.010 --> 00:16:04.220
Susan really didn’t stand a chance.

00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:07.130
Flash forward and Karen’s surprisingly still
alive.

00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:11.739
The detective seems to think that Matthew
killed Jennifer, drug her into the attic and

00:16:11.739 --> 00:16:16.360
into his embrace, then killed himself, while
Emma simultaneously died in her sleep.

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:20.910
I feel like a competent forensics analyst
would refute this narrative really quickly.

00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:25.720
Oh and Susan also disappeared at around the
same time, but I'm sure she killed herself

00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:26.720
too.

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:29.779
Just another run of the mill coordinated familial
mass suicide.

00:16:29.779 --> 00:16:34.610
And the little boy that Karen said she saw,
that died 3 years ago in that house, definitely

00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:36.490
just a figment of her imagination.

00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:46.310
I think this detective needs to go get an
onion bagel with cream cheese for Agent Smecker.

00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:50.110
His subordinate puts it together, that they
were the first family to live in that house

00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:53.569
since the murder 3 years ago, implying the
curse.

00:16:53.569 --> 00:16:58.089
Karen overhears that all the previous tenants
died within days of entering the house, and

00:16:58.089 --> 00:17:00.079
they weren’t all killed in the house.

00:17:00.079 --> 00:17:04.449
She realizes she has very little time, and
there’s nowhere that’s safe.

00:17:04.449 --> 00:17:08.899
Instead of visiting a Buddhist temple for
expert help, Karen goes to see her waiter

00:17:08.899 --> 00:17:09.899
boyfriend.

00:17:09.899 --> 00:17:13.531
He tries to get her to open up, and she tells
him that she thinks she saw something, that

00:17:13.531 --> 00:17:16.279
she isn’t sure, but something else was there
with them.

00:17:16.279 --> 00:17:21.410
Yah, the ghost got right in your face, what’re
you confused about.

00:17:21.410 --> 00:17:27.199
I remember this scene when I was a kid, it
legitimately made me afraid of car window

00:17:27.199 --> 00:17:28.199
reflections.

00:17:28.199 --> 00:17:33.000
It’s very important to stay fresh and clean
while being tormented and hunted down by murderous

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.309
evil spirits.

00:17:34.309 --> 00:17:39.049
Back at the care center, the creepy little
kid sic’s the disfigured Yoko on Alex.

00:17:39.049 --> 00:17:41.659
Do you really need to touch the blood to know
it’s blood?

00:17:41.659 --> 00:17:42.659
And please.

00:17:42.659 --> 00:17:44.039
Dont, walk, up, to, her.

00:17:44.039 --> 00:17:48.309
For the love of god.

00:17:48.309 --> 00:17:57.390
Poor Alex, like the others, he just couldn’t
know what hit him.

00:17:57.390 --> 00:18:00.370
Karen’s doing her own detective work on
the Saeki family.

00:18:00.370 --> 00:18:05.380
The little boy she saw was actually dead,
and the ghost she saw was probably the deceased

00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:06.380
mother.

00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:10.480
Both were murdered by the father, who later
hung himself according to the article.

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:14.190
Peter’s suicide was also written about in
an article on the same page.

00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:19.039
It’s not clear why he killed himself or
if there was any connection to the Saeki family.

00:18:19.039 --> 00:18:22.720
The detective is checking out the security
tapes from Susan’s building.

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:31.380
The onryo comes out of the shadow like before
and shuffles up to the camera.

00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:44.289
It’s at this moment that he realized he
fucked up.

00:18:44.289 --> 00:18:45.990
Karen is following the Peter lead.

00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:49.100
I’m not sure why, as far as Karen knows,
it didn’t seem like there was a solid connection

00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:50.570
between the house and him.

00:18:50.570 --> 00:18:55.730
Kayako managed to photobomb every single one
of Peter’s photos, and this was before she

00:18:55.730 --> 00:18:56.850
was a ghost.

00:18:56.850 --> 00:18:58.620
Impressive stalking skills.

00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:00.720
We flashback to pre-suicide Peter.

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:03.710
He’s got a secret admirer from some girl
he doesn’t know.

00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:05.620
Uh oh, it’s Kayako.

00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:09.519
Looks like the father already did the damage,
and the house is cursed.

00:19:09.519 --> 00:19:16.929
Peter innocently tries to help Toshio, but
Toshio has other plans.

00:19:16.929 --> 00:19:24.840
I wonder if Kayako was going to kill him before
he committed suicide, considering she got

00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:27.289
killed because she was madly in love with
him.

00:19:27.289 --> 00:19:30.730
Karen confronts the detective about what he
knows of the house.

00:19:30.730 --> 00:19:35.409
The detective reveals that 2 of his colleagues
died mysteriously, and one disappeared.

00:19:35.409 --> 00:19:38.700
All were investigating the murders that occured
in that house.

00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:43.380
Knowing that they’ve both been in that house,
they know they’re marked for death, along

00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:55.360
with all the police that entered the home.

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:59.480
Since the detective has knowledge of the onryo
and Ju-On curse, you’d think he would try

00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:01.570
to enlist the help of the Buddhists as well.

00:20:01.570 --> 00:20:04.620
Instead, he admits defeat.

00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:07.740
Well, almost.

00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:11.649
Burning the house down is a pretty reasonable
conclusion given their limited knowledge of

00:20:11.649 --> 00:20:12.649
the curse.

00:20:12.649 --> 00:20:14.419
It’s not clear if it’ll work.

00:20:14.419 --> 00:20:18.600
If it does, this should become standard police
procedure from now on.

00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:21.710
I’d throw a molotov cocktail from the outside.

00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:29.960
Inside and alone is too risky.

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:34.059
This would be a mistake.

00:20:34.059 --> 00:20:44.760
Come on, you know it’s the ghost of the
murdered boy.

00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:46.139
That was just stupid.

00:20:46.139 --> 00:20:48.330
It looked like it was the father drowning
him.

00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:53.170
Either that was a form that Kayako took, or
Takeo became an onryo when Kayako’s spirit

00:20:53.170 --> 00:20:54.170
hung him.

00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:58.520
Karen returns home, and it seems Doug left
a message for her, telling her that Alex and

00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:03.100
Yoko were found dead, and that he was going
to come find her at the Saeki house.

00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:04.100
Doug!

00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:06.500
Why would Karen go back to that house?

00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:09.760
Just don’t go inside the crime scene at
least.

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:13.179
Karen, hearing Doug’s intentions, chases
after him to stop him.

00:21:13.179 --> 00:21:16.520
It’s too late though, Doug has already doomed
himself.

00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:19.179
Instead of finding Doug, Karen finds Peter.

00:21:19.179 --> 00:21:23.750
Apparently evil spirits sometimes like to
take you down memory lane before murdering

00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:24.750
you.

00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:28.429
The onryo show’s Karen Kayako’s deadly
infatuation with Peter.

00:21:28.429 --> 00:21:32.640
It was a love affair that led to the dad murdering
them and the kitty in rage.

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:37.049
Thanks Kayako, but I really don’t think
Karen gives a shit about your family drama,

00:21:37.049 --> 00:21:40.650
and it’s not like this is actionable intel
considering you’re going to kill her in

00:21:40.650 --> 00:21:41.980
a few minutes.

00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:46.639
Karen’s hallucination of Peter continues,
and Peter’s curiosity of the fly infested

00:21:46.639 --> 00:21:56.130
closet with bloody handprints on it gets the
best of him.

00:21:56.130 --> 00:22:06.590
Peter nopes out of the house, barely able
to walk with what he just witnessed.

00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:11.090
Karen’s got nerves of steel, because she
sticks around to check out the thumping noise

00:22:11.090 --> 00:22:21.740
in the other room.

00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:25.830
Is there a room in this house that isn’t
filled with horrifying shit.

00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:30.899
Kayako continues showing her Netflix documentary
about her murder to provide backstory to Karen

00:22:30.899 --> 00:22:32.799
for literally no reason.

00:22:32.799 --> 00:22:34.160
It's not looking good for doug.

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:49.480
He’s still alive, but the situation is getting
pretty dire.

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:54.740
Kayako makes out with Doug with her sexy raspy
voice, then crawls over to Karen.

00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:59.030
Karen tries to escape through the front door,
but this onryo bitch is everywhere.

00:22:59.030 --> 00:23:04.019
In a hail mary, Karen grabs Doug's cigarette
lighter as he's croaking back to life.

00:23:04.019 --> 00:23:21.230
It seems Kayako forgot one thing, Karen’s
boyfriend’s a smoker.

00:23:21.230 --> 00:23:23.961
The place burns down as Kayako crawls on top
of Karen.

00:23:23.961 --> 00:23:29.850
Karen survives the fire, meaning the house
survived, meaning Kayako survived, meaning

00:23:29.850 --> 00:23:31.120
Karen’s.

00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:35.690
The detectives corroborate this by telling
us the firefighters put out the fire saving

00:23:35.690 --> 00:23:37.510
the house and Karen.

00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:41.120
Nobody talks about the poor firefighter who
put the fire out and drug Karen out of the

00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:44.480
house who doomed himself and Karen.

00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:54.039
She visits Doug’s body, and I bet you can’t
guess the dramatic twist ending.

00:23:54.039 --> 00:23:55.240
The movie ends.

00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:58.600
Let’s recap who we could’ve saved, and
whose death was inevitable.

00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:01.529
I’m gonna start with some good ole victim
blaming.

00:24:01.529 --> 00:24:05.809
Kayako shouldn’t have kept a diary detailing
her love affair when she damn well knows her

00:24:05.809 --> 00:24:07.720
husband is a jealous psycho.

00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:12.159
But she got caught and was murdered for it,
along with Toshio and the cat.

00:24:12.159 --> 00:24:17.080
Peter naively sought out his secret admirer,
and tried to help an injured boy but instead

00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:18.970
cursed himself with death.

00:24:18.970 --> 00:24:20.309
Nothing he could have done.

00:24:20.309 --> 00:24:24.610
Matthew, Jennifer, Susan, and Emma all were
killed for trying to buy a house.

00:24:24.610 --> 00:24:29.039
Since the events unfolded fairly quickly,
and Yoko was sent in to help Emma at around

00:24:29.039 --> 00:24:33.620
the same time the family was being mysteriously
murdered, she didn’t stand a chance either.

00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:38.290
When Karen was face to face with the onryo,
it was clear she was in danger from an evil

00:24:38.290 --> 00:24:39.290
spirit.

00:24:39.290 --> 00:24:43.070
With her knowledge of Japanese mythology,
it would’ve been reasonable to enlist the

00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:45.049
help of a Buddhist Priest.

00:24:45.049 --> 00:24:50.779
According to Wikipedia, I mean Japanese mythology,
there might be some ways to exorcise the onryo:

00:24:50.779 --> 00:24:53.600
The easiest way is to help it fulfill its
purpose.

00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:57.350
Traditionally by enacting revenge upon the
onryo’s slayer.

00:24:57.350 --> 00:25:02.440
Since Kayako already took revenge on her slayer,
Takeo, this method didn’t work.

00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:06.450
Give the onryo’s remains a proper burial
with all rites performed.

00:25:06.450 --> 00:25:09.480
The timing is going to be tight, but it might
work.

00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:13.919
Allow the ghost to consummate its passion
with its intended lover.

00:25:13.919 --> 00:25:16.929
Peter just had to fuck Kayako’s evil spirit.

00:25:16.929 --> 00:25:20.690
Might be hard to get it up given her corpsey
appearance, but that’s just a grenade he

00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:21.820
needs to jump on.

00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:23.639
I hope he likes croakers.

00:25:23.639 --> 00:25:28.130
The emotions of the onryō are particularly
strong, so they are the least likely to be

00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:31.070
pacified by these methods.

00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:35.529
The onryo can be repelled by placing holy
Shinto writings on the onryo’s forehead

00:25:35.529 --> 00:25:38.980
to banish the spirit, which seems tricky to
accomplish.

00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:44.260
They can also be attached to a house's entry
ways to prevent the onryo from entering.

00:25:44.260 --> 00:25:47.970
Karen and the other cursed victims could do
this to buy themselves time to figure out

00:25:47.970 --> 00:25:53.180
a way to exorcise the onryo and break the
grudge curse against them.

00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:54.769
Burn the house down completely.

00:25:54.769 --> 00:25:57.870
Karen and the detective attempted this, but
both failed.

00:25:57.870 --> 00:26:01.610
It makes sense that burning the house and
their remains would remove any tether the

00:26:01.610 --> 00:26:03.790
onryo had to the physical world.

00:26:03.790 --> 00:26:08.470
With a number of options, Karen may have been
able to break the curse, saving her, Doug,

00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:11.590
the Detective, Alex, the Firefighters, and
the Cops.

00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:14.039
If all that fails, well, everyone’s dead.

00:26:14.039 --> 00:26:18.870
I don’t think we can really say we beat
the onryo, as none of these options are really

00:26:18.870 --> 00:26:22.440
proven to work even if we survived long enough
to try them.

00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:26.230
I’d say the Ju-On curse and the onryo were
unbeaten.

00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:30.220
Thanks for watching, and, well, no final momento
will save your life.

00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:33.830
You probably won’t know what hit you when
an onryo follows you home.

00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:35.610
Sweet dreams.
