00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.400
Hey everyone. Welcome back to&nbsp;
Movie Recap. My name is Silverra.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.586
Today I'm gonna show you a 2000 superhero&nbsp;
thriller film called

00:00:13.586 --> 00:00:14.783
Unbreakable.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:23.120
The film opens as we see a baby being born in&nbsp;
west Philadelphia. This is Elijah Price. Elijah&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:28.480
is so brittle that he is born with broken arms&nbsp;
and legs. As he grows older, he is taunted at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.920
school and called Mr. Glass by his classmates&nbsp;
since he is so fragile. As an adult, he runs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.200
a successful high priced comic book art gallery&nbsp;
specializing in original drawings of super heroes.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.240
David Dunn is a security guard&nbsp;
at the local college stadium.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:50.080
His marriage is crumbling and&nbsp;
in fact, his wife, Audrey Dunn,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.654
sleeps downstairs in their son's room,&nbsp;
and David sleeps upstairs with his son.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.720
On his way back home from a job interview in New&nbsp;
York, David's train malfunctions and derails,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:08.400
killing everyone on board except David. He doesn't&nbsp;
even have a scratch. After the memorial service&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.600
for the crash victims, David finds a note on&nbsp;
his windshield. It's from a store named "Limited&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.280
Edition" (Elijah's store) and the note asks,&nbsp;
"How many days of your life have you been sick?"

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.960
David asks his boss and his wife but no&nbsp;
one can ever remember him being sick.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.080
David takes his son to "Limited&nbsp;
Edition" where he meets Elijah.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:36.000
Elijah explains his theory to David. If Elijah can&nbsp;
be born with brittle bones and very easily hurt,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.520
shouldn't there be someone the exact&nbsp;
opposite? Elijah has researched&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.320
every disaster to find a sole survivor&nbsp;
without a scratch but has had no luck.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.760
After years of searching, he&nbsp;
finally has found one in David Dunn.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.280
David thinks it's interesting but really just&nbsp;
thinks Elijah is nuts. Back at the stadium,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.920
David gets a call that there is someone there&nbsp;
trying to sneak in and asking for David. It's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:05.120
Elijah and he starts explaining his comic book&nbsp;
theories to David. Theories about everyday men&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:11.440
being super heroes, having powers they haven't yet&nbsp;
realized and so on. David bumps into a guy in line&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.720
and tells the security at the end of the line to&nbsp;
start frisking people. They watch as the guy David&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:22.560
bumped in to, sees everyone being frisked and&nbsp;
leaves the line. Elijah asks David what that was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.600
all about and David tells him that when he bumped&nbsp;
him, he had an image of a certain kind of handgun.

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.640
David goes back to work but Elijah&nbsp;
follows the guy David bumped into.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.440
They go down a long flight of stairs, Elijah&nbsp;
falls shattering his leg and breaking several&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.960
other bones but the last thing he sees is the&nbsp;
man's handgun, just as David described it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:48.663
Elijah was right, David does&nbsp;
have some kind of special gift.

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.360
Back at home, David is working out&nbsp;
in the basement with his weight set.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.400
His son believed everything Elijah said&nbsp;
about David being a hero with a special gift.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:06.000
David still doesn't believe. David asks his son to&nbsp;
take some weight off but without him knowing, he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.960
puts more weight on. David lifts 250 lbs, the most&nbsp;
he's ever done. His son continues putting on more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:19.040
weight until David is now up to 350lbs. He has had&nbsp;
all this strength all along that he never knew.

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.960
Elijah needs his leg rehabbed and his&nbsp;
nurse is Audrey, David's wife. Elijah&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:31.760
asks her questions about her and David and she&nbsp;
explains to him how when they were going out,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.400
David was a star football player but&nbsp;
got in a car accident due to icy roads.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.680
David never played football again. It was&nbsp;
because of that, that she and David were married.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.929
Had he continued to play, she&nbsp;
knows they would have grown apart.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:52.800
Back at work, David gets a call from his son's&nbsp;
school that his son has been hurt. His son had&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:58.240
hoped that some of David's super hero traits had&nbsp;
rubbed off on him. He tried to protect someone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:03.760
that was being picked on and instead got hurt in&nbsp;
the process. The school nurse remembers David from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:09.280
when he was at that same school. In fact, it was&nbsp;
because of David that they have strict rules about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:14.800
the pool. It seems that David had been picked on&nbsp;
near the pool when he was a student there. He fell&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:20.160
in and was left in the pool to drown. He was found&nbsp;
at the bottom of the pool but somehow survived.

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.080
David tells this story to Elijah, that in fact,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.880
David can get hurt. Elijah tells him&nbsp;
that every super hero has a weakness.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.280
David's kryptonite is water. The water from&nbsp;
the pool and the water from the icy roads.

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:43.040
David's wife decides that him surviving the&nbsp;
train crash is a sign that maybe they should&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:47.440
give their marriage another try. They go&nbsp;
out on a "date" and he explains to her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.915
that he felt their marriage was over when he&nbsp;
stopped waking her up after he had a bad dream.

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:59.680
The next night, David breaks into the train&nbsp;
station and examines some of the wrecked trains.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:05.040
He starts recalling his own car crash from years&nbsp;
earlier and remembers that he wasn't hurt at all.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:09.840
In fact, he had to use his superhuman strength&nbsp;
to rescue Audrey from the flaming vehicle.

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:16.480
He goes to Elijah and tells him he&nbsp;
is right, he has never been sick&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:21.280
or injured in any way. Elijah tells him&nbsp;
that it's no coincidence that David is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:25.040
in the security field. He needs to go&nbsp;
to where people are and protect them.

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:33.360
It's a rainy day and David, wearing a hooded rain&nbsp;
poncho heads to Penn station. Hundreds of people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:38.400
are passing by. Whenever someone bumps into David&nbsp;
he has a vision of that person doing something&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:44.080
evil. One is a jewel thief, another a rapist, but&nbsp;
when the maintenance man bumps into him, David&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:49.229
gets a horrible vision. The vision is of the man&nbsp;
going to someone's home and killing the homeowner.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:57.840
David, still wearing the poncho now looking more&nbsp;
and more like a super hero's cape, follows the guy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:03.600
as he leaves work. The guy goes to a nice house in&nbsp;
a nice neighborhood. David sneaks in the back and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:09.920
finds the dead homeowner inside. He goes upstairs&nbsp;
and rescues two sisters tied up in their bathroom.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:15.120
He goes into another room and finds the mother&nbsp;
tied up. The window is open and David looks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:19.520
out. When he turns back around, there is the&nbsp;
maintenance worker who pushes David out the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:25.120
window. David lands on the backyard pool that&nbsp;
has its winter cover on. Suddenly, the cover&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:30.000
starts collapsing with David's weight and he&nbsp;
gets all tangled up underwater with the cover.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.280
He is drowning again but the two sisters force a&nbsp;
pole down to him and David grabs it and is saved.

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:43.600
David heads back upstairs and wrestles with the&nbsp;
guy and finally kills him by breaking his neck.

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:51.120
The next scene is David back at home, hanging&nbsp;
up his poncho, and carrying his sleeping wife&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:57.040
upstairs to their bed. She wakes up and asks&nbsp;
him what is wrong. "I had a bad dream" he says.

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:04.720
In the morning while having breakfast, David&nbsp;
slides the newspaper over to his son and holds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:10.400
a finger to his mouth to shush him. The headline&nbsp;
tells of a mystery hero that saved the two girls.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:15.520
The picture is an artist's rendition of what&nbsp;
the girls saw. It shows a superhero-like figure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:20.080
with a hood and cape. The boy looks up at&nbsp;
his dad and David just smiles and nods.

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:27.840
David goes to Elijah's gallery where Elijah&nbsp;
is having a huge gathering for a special show.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:32.320
He and David go to Elijah's back office&nbsp;
so they can discuss what had happened.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:37.360
Elijah has been in a wheelchair since his fall.&nbsp;
He is real proud of David and they shake hands.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:40.640
Suddenly...

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:45.040
Just like Christopher Walken in Stephen&nbsp;
King's "The Dead Zone", while shaking hands,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:50.240
David has a vision of Elijah setting a building&nbsp;
on fire, another vision of Elijah causing a plane&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:55.680
crash and finally, a vision of Elijah exiting the&nbsp;
driving compartment of David's train that crashed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:59.680
David looks around Elijah's office&nbsp;
and is horrified at what he sees.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:03.440
Newspaper clippings of hundreds of&nbsp;
disasters from around the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:08.480
Elijah is the mastermind behind all these events&nbsp;
and has staged them for his own selfish benefit.

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:13.280
Just like in the comics, every evil villain&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:16.480
needs a worthy adversary and&nbsp;
Elijah has finally found his.

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:20.800
David backs away in horror as Elijah,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:25.520
who in his wheelchair now looks more like&nbsp;
Professor X of the X-men, proclaims...

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:27.304
"They call me Mr. Glass!"

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:34.080
Just before the final credits, a message&nbsp;
appears that says that David contacted&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:37.280
the authorities and Elijah is&nbsp;
now in a mental institution.

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:42.880
Thanks for watching. See&nbsp;
