00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.880
Welcome to the breakdown where we breakdown
all the messed up movies!

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.120
Welcome to the first day
of Screepy Week, the last week of Spooktober

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.030
that I gotta celebrate.

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.910
Now the theme of today, is
Ultimate Despair,and I aint talking about

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.880
no video game references, I'm referring to
a hopeless bleak

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.880
mood to start off the week.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.110
The film for that mood is called one of the
bleakest films of all time, Lilya-

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:30.110
4ever.

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:36.070
Lilya-4ever is the story of a 15 to 16 year
old girl from an unnamed country, but everybody

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:37.610
speaks
Russian.

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:43.020
Lilya has to survive on her own, and must
do whatever it takes to ensure a golden future!

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.660
The
film Girl Lost that we did, its definitely

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.810
inspired by this film, and also No Child of
Mine is kinda like this

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:49.890
movie too!

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.040
This is a classic movie you will see on all
the disturbing film lists!

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:59.579
Now remember disturbing is
not just torture porn and extreme horror movies,

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.250
its movies like this that make you also think
about real

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.760
life by putting us in the shoes of another!

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.700
If you want to see what happens, including
all the messed up

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:15.439
parts, stay tune for the breakdown!

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:20.509
The movie starts out with a somewhat somber
score, before switching quickly to a hectic

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:21.920
rock and roll
song.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.490
A girl comes onto the frame running frantically
as if she is trying to escape, and as if there

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.189
is
nowhere left to go.

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.479
It seems like she's running from someone.

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:35.680
She then comes forth to a familiar bridge,
and looks over the height and passing cars.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.899
Her worried face turns to one of, should I
do this?

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:42.649
We cut
away quickly before we see what she was going

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:43.649
to do.

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.850
Now that's how you bring me into a movie.

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.609
Next
the intro credits take over, playing a song

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:52.099
you might hear on GTA IV or something.

00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:55.679
Three months before
what we seen in the beginning, in an undisclosed

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:58.829
country that was once apart of the Soviet
Union, we

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.869
are formally introduced to Lilya.

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:04.569
Lilya packs this important painting up.

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:09.929
A friend of Lilya comes, and LIlya
tells her in the happiest of moods that she

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.930
and her mom and moving to the United States.

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.490
Her mom's
boyfriend lives there, so they would live

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:16.490
with him.

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.820
She and her friend hit up the store to see
if they can

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.360
get some ciggies for free.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.330
Damn..Good luck breathing.

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.090
She's like who needs lungs!

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.720
They just piss the
cashier off, but she don't care she's like

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.750
fuck you I'm going to the states!

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:36.350
Outside, Lilya explains her mom met a Russian
man who lives in the U.S. She's very excited

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.220
to come to
America though, shouting it out for everybody

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:40.320
to hear.

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.140
She's jinxing herself though.

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.750
Her mother and her
mom's boyfriend tell Lilya that they will

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.040
first go to the United States without her,
and then Lilya can

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.160
come later.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.220
She doesn't define "later".. at all.

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.220
A depressed Lilya unpacks her bags.

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.900
Her mom meanwhile
is in bed with the boyfriend, whispering that

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.450
it'll just be the two of us!

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.700
Lilya listens as her mom and the
man have sex!

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.320
The next morning, the mom gets ready to leave
but goes inside to say goodbye.

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.570
Lilya
gives the silent treatment, including a half

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:17.040
hearted hug goodbye before her mom exits.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.860
Lilya sits in
thought after she leaves, and it takes 30

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.650
seconds for her to abandon her anger and runs
after her mom

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:24.650
screaming Momma!

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.120
Don't Go!

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.750
Honestly its quite sad to see, like we are
barely 10 minutes into the film

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.980
and I'm already about to cry! probably cuz
it hits close to home but even if it didn't

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.010
its sad.

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.350
Plus LIlya
over here crying so loud that they can hear

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:41.920
her in the United States.

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:47.420
Lilya runs after and hits the stanky
leg in the mud as a bothered mom is driven

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:48.420
away.

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.450
Well to put just a little humor on the scene,
I like how

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.480
almost every domesticated animal likes to
smell us before walking away.

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.480
Like we stank or something!

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.600
Back inside, she rips up a picture of her
mom who left her behind, only to then put

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.050
it back together.

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:07.020
She
is interrupted by her Aunt Anna, making her

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:11.050
move into a smaller recently inhabited apartment.

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:13.870
She
argues with her aunt about it, but ultimately

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.850
is forced to pack her things and make her
way to the

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:19.780
apartment an old war vet died in.

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.770
The next morning, Lilya arrives late to class,
and the mean teacher

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:27.069
rubs it into her face that she isn't in America.

00:04:27.069 --> 00:04:30.660
She hands back graded papers, sarcastically
saying ..you

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.330
have a golden future ahead...

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.500
Lilya walks out telling her to go to hell,
I will have a golden future!

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.870
Later
that night, a boy named Volodya, but I'll

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:43.279
just call him Lil V, plays on the court alone.

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:47.759
He did that the
previous night too, and doesn't seem to like

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:48.759
going home.

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:54.050
He follows this group of boys,who are friends
with Lilya.

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:58.780
Lilya and the group just party around, the
boys for sure drink cough medicine like its

00:04:58.780 --> 00:04:59.780
water.

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:03.860
Sure it gets a little kissy kissy in there,
and Lil V was trying to take advantage of

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.939
the mood, but overall its
just a fun time.

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:11.080
After everything settles down though, Lilya
is crying.

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.590
Everybody is soon kicked out by the
aunt for making too much noise.

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:18.509
Lil V goes home, but he is kicked out by his
father who screams in

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:19.509
anger.

00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:25.790
He makes his way to a familiar bridge, looking
towards the ground with suicidal intent.

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:28.919
Lilya later
leaves to look for him though, almost as if

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:32.289
her spider sense tingeled, and manages to
get him to come

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:33.289
down.

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:37.979
He was sad alright you could hear it in his
voice, but he wasn't overly distraught like

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:41.400
we normally
see someone about to kill themself in films.

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.710
Lil V asks to sleep on the couch since the
father kicked him

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:45.710
out

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:51.059
Despite being younger though, they basically
get all cozy together but in a friendly way.

00:05:51.059 --> 00:05:54.800
He says he did
think about jumping, he didn't want to live

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.389
anymore, but Lilya's interruption saved his
life, and he says

00:05:58.389 --> 00:06:00.099
he's gonna save hers!

00:06:00.099 --> 00:06:04.910
The next day, she goes to the store, but has
to leave with a few less items cuz she

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:06.279
is broke.

00:06:06.279 --> 00:06:11.120
That definitely makes her angry, especially
since her mother has not sent any money or

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:14.000
even a
single letter to communicate ever since getting

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.000
to America.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.969
Some time, probably during that little hang
out, her friend told her about a quick way

00:06:19.969 --> 00:06:20.969
to make money.

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:25.539
Seeing as how she puts on the make up and
the hair extensions, it seems clear on what

00:06:25.539 --> 00:06:29.580
she is doing to get that money, but its not
trust me.

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:32.289
They go
to the club and dance around, seemingly to

00:06:32.289 --> 00:06:36.650
attract men, but nobody pays attention to
Lilya, so she just

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:40.569
sits ruining her lungs and waiting on her
friend to get back.

00:06:40.569 --> 00:06:46.659
After, her friend dodges her question of
"How was it" or "What happened", so I'm guessing

00:06:46.659 --> 00:06:49.409
her friend is doing some kind of prostitution.

00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:52.830
The next morning, Lilya gets a visit from
her friend.

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:56.309
Her name is Natasha, so I'll stop calling
her friend.

00:06:56.309 --> 00:07:03.199
Natasha says, "I came to give you the money
back, I don't need it anymore" We know Lilya

00:07:03.199 --> 00:07:06.639
never got
any money, so it looks like her friend lied

00:07:06.639 --> 00:07:10.240
to her father here about the source of the
money, saying she

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:13.419
got it from her protitute friend named Lilya.

00:07:13.419 --> 00:07:17.869
At school, Lilya is like "hey blood, whats
up with that money

00:07:17.869 --> 00:07:18.869
blood!"

00:07:18.869 --> 00:07:23.460
She asks Natasha for an explanation on why
she got some money out of nowhere, and these

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:26.740
boys
look at Lilya as they walk away.

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:31.439
Like I thought, Natasha lied about who really
was the prostitute and did

00:07:31.439 --> 00:07:34.639
the sexual acts, but Natasha told her whole
little group of friends too.

00:07:34.639 --> 00:07:39.169
She continues the lie when Lilya
tries to give the money back, saying I don't

00:07:39.169 --> 00:07:43.999
need your money, and LIlya is called a whore
by ugly ass

00:07:43.999 --> 00:07:44.999
boyfriend.

00:07:44.999 --> 00:07:47.110
She throws the money away after running out.

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:52.029
While sitting with Lil V, this group of boys
bully her and call her names, but she does

00:07:52.029 --> 00:07:53.729
a great job ignoring them.

00:07:53.729 --> 00:07:57.849
She sits right there, writing Lilya 4-
ever on the bench!

00:07:57.849 --> 00:07:59.789
Why the hell are yall so hostile!

00:07:59.789 --> 00:08:03.039
It must be a different time different context,
cuz I

00:08:03.039 --> 00:08:08.259
know girls who fuck around for free and still
wouldn't get told to slit their own throat.

00:08:08.259 --> 00:08:12.180
Lilya goes home,
discovering that her electricity has been

00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:13.180
cut off.

00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:15.860
She has to find out how to make money and
fast!

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:20.169
She goes to her aunts place for help, but
a neighbor reveals her aunt moved!

00:08:20.169 --> 00:08:22.479
Where did she move?

00:08:22.479 --> 00:08:26.409
Well
she moved in the same big nicer apartment

00:08:26.409 --> 00:08:29.039
that Lilya and her mother used to live in.

00:08:29.039 --> 00:08:32.060
Man this female
dog get on my nerves.

00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:36.100
She tells Lilya to do what your mother did,
sell your body.

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:39.050
She runs out after
stealing some food and drink.

00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:43.060
Lil V spends the night again, it was his birthday
today too, and Lilya

00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:45.440
promises to get him a present some day.

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:49.320
Well hopefully, cuz she gets pissed at him
after he fakes suicide

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:51.020
just to get a kiss.

00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:54.980
After kicking his ass out, she decides she
is gonna sell some of her stuff to make

00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:55.980
money!

00:08:55.980 --> 00:09:00.240
Damn she out here looking like a hooper, but
her low amount of things to buy only gets

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:01.450
her
ignored.

00:09:01.450 --> 00:09:06.150
Lil V comes to apologize, and she ditches
her broke sale so they can go hang out!

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:11.930
They go to an
abandoned military building called The Pentagon.

00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:17.100
It's also where Lil V goes to sleep sometimes
when he

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:18.630
gets kicked out.

00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:24.820
Lilya and Lil V both have military fathers,
except Lilya never knew her father, describing

00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:28.280
him as the man who just wanted to have sex
with my mother.

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:33.650
They soon run around the abandoned
soviet building, reaching Lil V's lil room,

00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:35.210
and sniffing glue together.

00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:39.800
In a glue high, they run around the
rooftop of the building, before getting they

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:42.320
ass right back to laying down.

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:46.370
Lil V talks about life after
death, and 100 percent believes that you will

00:09:46.370 --> 00:09:48.980
become an angel in paradise.

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:53.600
Lilya is nauseous after the
conversation and probably after the glue too,

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:55.880
and leaves this place to go back home.

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:59.630
Its at the mailbox
where she discovers a letter asking for her

00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:01.720
to meet social services.

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:06.580
At the social services place, a woman
tells her that her mother has renounced her

00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:07.580
parenthood.

00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:10.710
Basically, she has given Lilya up.

00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:14.370
The letter her
mom wrote to the social services calls Lilya

00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:16.800
an "unwanted child".

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:21.390
After hearing that, Lilya burns her mother's
picture and memory from existence.

00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:26.140
No guardian, no way to
feed herself or anything, Lilya turns to something

00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:29.620
she has no choice but to do, prostitution.

00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:32.870
She goes to
that same hectic club looking for potential

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:36.290
customers, and finds a well off man who brings
her back to

00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:38.040
his apartment.

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:43.420
After an initial nervous feeling, she later
has sex with the man, only to run out after

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:44.880
throwing up.

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:49.880
She has money now though, and happily gets
some food and some lung killers with what

00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:50.880
she has earned.

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:56.680
That's not all she got though, she also bought
a basket ball for Lil V's belated birthday.

00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:58.970
It's the best gift he ever got too!

00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:02.010
She tells him she got the money from her mom.

00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:05.200
Lilya still has to
maintain, and goes back to work.

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:09.160
At the club she flirts with someone giving
her the eye, only to get

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:10.560
interrupted by Reed Richards.

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:15.240
After, while she is walking home, the guy
she was flirting with, his name is

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:16.580
Andrei.

00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:20.110
Andrei gets her attention, and we see that
her last client was violent.

00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:23.740
He asks to drive her home,
promising to be a normal guy.

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:28.230
He does seem pretty nice, and speaks like
he doesn't want to get in her

00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:31.140
pants, and agrees to go out on a date with
him.

00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:34.720
This encounter is overheard by Lil V, who
tells her all

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:38.730
night and all morning that Andrei just wants
to sleep with her.

00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:42.900
She needs a break though, and Andrei takes
to a entertainment center.

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:44.890
I used to work in a place like
this.

00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:49.300
The excitement they share is just what she
needed, and she even kisses him on the first

00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:50.300
date!

00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:53.770
After
a few days, Andrei asks and convinces Lilya

00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:55.830
to come to Sweden with him.

00:11:55.830 --> 00:11:59.320
He promises her a better life
and one that isn't boring.

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:05.280
Later, while LIlya an Li V are in the room,
that group of boys break in, the ones

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:06.420
who bullied her.

00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:12.220
They hold Lil V back, and strip Lilya and
throw her clothes out to rape her.

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:15.420
After they
leave, Liliya tells Lil V that she wont leave

00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:18.280
him here behind, and wants him to come to
Sweden with her

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:19.330
and Andrei.

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:24.070
First, she has to ask him, but she is so head
over heels for him that she cant even think

00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:25.230
about her surroundings.

00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:30.920
Lil V seems to see through the act Andrei
holds up, but Lilya believes he's just

00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:31.920
jealous.

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:36.930
Ultimately, Lilya has to leave Lil V behind
in a scene that looks similar to when Lilya's

00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:38.590
mom left
her behind.

00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:43.240
I don't mess with this decision at all Lilya,
you just met this fool.

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:47.930
It's so trash leaving him
behind and not at least appearing more sad.

00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:52.000
She was unaware of how much Lil V really needed
her.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:58.060
While she leaves for Sweden, Lil V, broken
and left alone decides to kill himself by

00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:00.080
swallowing a bunch of
pills.

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:05.020
A tenant tries to wake him up, unaware that
he has died.

00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:09.830
Lilya arrives in Sweden, and is met my
some business partner of Andrei.

00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:14.010
He takes her passport, and takes her to a
fancy apartment building.

00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:19.580
Now she is in a better flat that she lived
in initially, but it looks owned and not used

00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:20.760
for a while.

00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:23.310
Most
importantly, she puts up the guardian angel

00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:26.450
picture she loves, and we cut to a different
realm of

00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:27.450
existence.

00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:32.220
One where Lil V is an angel playing his favorite
game on top of a roof.

00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:38.580
He is her guardian angel
now, watching over Lilya like a guardian angel.

00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:42.250
The next morning, Lilya is about to realize
the real reason

00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:43.730
she is here.

00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:46.860
While taking a bath, Andrei's business friend
comes in.

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:53.080
He then barges into the bathroom,
and Lilya begs in English for him to stop.

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:57.410
Turns out Andrei arranged for Lilya to be
kept hostage by a pip.

00:13:57.410 --> 00:14:02.010
She can't even leave the apartment, and threatens
to kill her if she escapes.

00:14:02.010 --> 00:14:06.450
He even says even if she
manages to escape, she'll be sent back to

00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:10.190
her homeland by the police, and then they'll
come kill her

00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:11.370
there.

00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:13.810
That's why he took her passport.

00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:17.770
Lilya is forced to be a prostitute again and
is taken by the pimp

00:14:17.770 --> 00:14:19.220
to a clients house.

00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:25.330
For every client, we see through her point
of view, so I can't really show, but we can

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:38.370
probably see these weirdos.

00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:44.240
Worse off then she was before possibly, Angel
Lil V takes it upon himself to visit her.

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:48.110
They talk as if she
knew he died, overall I'm guessing it's a

00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:50.430
special encounter for her.

00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:57.120
He teleports her to the roof, and gifts
her the whole world.

00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:01.550
She rejects this gift, finding the world pretty
freaking wack.

00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:06.900
He regrets suicide, and
tries to convince her to love lift cuz you

00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:08.340
only live once.

00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:11.510
Suddenly she is awakened from her special
encounter.

00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:17.910
Her pimp tells her to put on make up, but
she instead cuts her hair and plays clown.

00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:23.250
After cleaning her up, he brings her to another
client, one who forces her to pretend to be

00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:24.750
his daughter.

00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:31.280
After that, Lilya tries to run away, only
to get caught and beaten by the pimp.

00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:34.529
Later the next day, Angel
Lil V wakes her up and shows her that the

00:15:34.529 --> 00:15:36.710
pimp forgot to lock the door.

00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:39.779
She sees this and decides to
escape.

00:15:39.779 --> 00:15:43.910
Now we are full circle back to the introduction
of the film.

00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:46.440
We also know why she was running
now.

00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:53.260
She was trying to not be found by the police
and be sent back to her homeland.

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:56.910
She runs away like
we saw in the beginning, and finds the bridge

00:15:56.910 --> 00:15:57.910
overlooking a street.

00:15:57.910 --> 00:16:04.090
She climbs right over it to kill herself,
which was what she was contemplating in the

00:16:04.090 --> 00:16:07.580
beginning, and Angel Lil V begs for her to
not do it.

00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:11.090
She
drowns him out though and ultimately jumps.

00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:14.500
She doesn't die instantly, and emergency services
try to

00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:16.010
resuscitate her.

00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:20.110
She eventually opens her eyes, where two alternatives
take place.

00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:24.850
The first shows her
traveling back in time to before she went

00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:29.050
to Sweden and she seems to live a good lift
rejecting Andrei's

00:16:29.050 --> 00:16:30.050
offer.

00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:35.870
The second alternative, or perhaps the true
one, is her playing with Lil V on top of the

00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:40.500
abandoned
Pentagon building, they both are angels!

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:43.130
Damn this movie was bleak.

00:16:43.130 --> 00:16:45.600
They call it one of the bleakest.

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:49.240
Definitely an inspiration for the movie Girl
Lost that we did.

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:54.000
Now you are at the end of the movie, and you
realize that this isn't just some story.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:59.840
This movie is based on the real life of Danguole(Dan
goo ahlay) Rasalaite(Rasala ee tay).

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:04.500
And if not her,
this is happening to someone right now as

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:08.890
you are watching this video, she died almost
20 years

00:17:08.890 --> 00:17:14.329
ago...and still we have this huge issue of
human trafficking and slavery, and that's

00:17:14.329 --> 00:17:17.709
just mentioning the
near end part of the movie, not the messed

00:17:17.709 --> 00:17:20.800
up things that happened before she left for
Sweden.

00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:22.730
Now
that we got through this film, lets talk about

00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:26.810
the most disturbed moment and most enjoyed
moment in

00:17:26.810 --> 00:17:29.500
that Spooky Stuff!

00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:35.520
So I'm gonna get right into it, this flim
so sad my head hurts.

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:41.630
The most disturbed moment is hard to pick
because each scene never seemed to peak in

00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:42.630
intensity.

00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:43.930
I'll name top 3.

00:17:43.930 --> 00:17:49.690
I'd say when Lil V killed himself,
seeing Lilya's realization of her life in

00:17:49.690 --> 00:17:52.170
Sweden, or maybe also when she killed herself.

00:17:52.170 --> 00:17:57.600
I don't want to
trivialize this film exactly.

00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:03.360
The most enjoyed moment is probably those
little endings at the end.

00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:10.060
Regardless of the fate of these main characters,
It was just good to see her smile again!

00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:11.610
And that's it.

00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:14.212
I
hope you guys enjoyed this video....and yes

00:18:14.212 --> 00:18:15.212
hope!

00:18:15.212 --> 00:18:16.880
Sure this was the Ultimate Despair day, but
don't let

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:18.559
despair get over you!

00:18:18.559 --> 00:18:23.100
Films like these hold a legacy, just like
Lilya, like Danguole!

00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:29.580
The title aint
meaningless, Lilya is 4-ever, and as long

00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:31.090
as we can look on these films and look at
life, we can try to

00:18:31.090 --> 00:18:32.550
make it better to live for others!

00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:35.450
Thanks for watching, SPOOKY OUT!
