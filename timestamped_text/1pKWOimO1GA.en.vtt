00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.250
Hi, Mystery Recapped here.

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.999
Today, I'm going to explain a horror film
called "Let Her Out."

00:00:05.999 --> 00:00:07.470
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.150
Watch out and take care!

00:00:12.934 --> 00:00:16.710
The film starts with a young woman who lives
at the "Gemini Motel."

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:17.789
She's a prostitute.

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.570
During a busy night, a shadowy figure approaches
her room; she is then attacked and raped by

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:23.919
the intruder.

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:28.410
She later discovers she is pregnant, and desperate
and alone, takes a pair of scissors to her

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.160
unborn, killing herself in the process, but
the child survives.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.980
Jumping 23 years from the incident, the film
shows Helen, who survived her pre-birth assault

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.650
from her frightened mother.

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.960
She is now a bike courier living in Toronto
with her best friend, Molly.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.250
One day, Helen is tasked to deliver goods
to her friend's house named Roman.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.280
That day is Helen's birthday, so Roman gives
her a painting which he claims to be the dark

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.830
side of Helen.

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:55.760
Helen immediately takes the painting home.

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.260
At her motel, Helen recounts to Molly the
story of her mother's death.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.880
Molly cares deeply about Helen's condition.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.480
Molly is always there to support her as Helen
doesn't have any other family.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.900
Shortly, Molly leaves the place because she
has an appointment with her boyfriend named- Ed

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:17.110
As she's returning from the Motel, Helen is
struck by a car, leaving her seriously injured.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.170
Helen is then taken to the hospital.

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.830
She suffers a head injury and some broken
bones.

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.130
Weeks later, Helen is finally allowed to go
home.

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.070
Molly and her friends start throwing a small
party to welcome Helen's arrival.

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.920
At the party, Helen meets Ed, Molly's boyfriend,
who seems interested in her.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.270
When the party is going on, suddenly Helen
begins to experience a blackout and lose consciousness.

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.060
She wakes up in an empty parking lot.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.030
Helen is confused by what happened earlier.

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.030
She immediately calls Molly to ask what happened
when she was unconscious.

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.880
Molly explains that Helen left the party without
telling her where she was going.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.690
Not knowing what happened, Helen immediately
returns home in a state of anxiety.

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:01.210
At home, Helen starts to paint strange pictures,
and because she is afraid of Roman's painting,

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.439
in the end, she puts it below and covers it
with a cloth.

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:10.170
The next day, Helen starts her day as usual,
such as exercising, eating, and showering.

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:17.510
Just as she finishes taking a shower, suddenly
she starts seeing a strange figure.

00:02:20.574 --> 00:02:24.980
Then, she experiences another blackout and
wakes up in front of her friends with an injured

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:25.980
foot.

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.540
Molly and others are confused.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.730
There, Molly explains to Helen that she went
out using only a towel.

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.430
For several hours, Helen had disappeared.

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.660
And returning home, Helen's foot is already
bleeding.

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.700
Helen begins to remove the broken glass from
her feet.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.850
The next day, Helen and Molly go to a doctor
named Dr. Headly to consult about what is

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.520
happening to Helen.

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.880
Doctor Headly begins to ask some questions.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.880
Helen explains that she is always moving from
place to place unconsciously.

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.099
She was in one place, and suddenly woke up
in another.

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:58.440
This has happened frequently since the accident.

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.680
Furthermore, she frequently sees a black shadow.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.250
After hearing her explanation, the doctor
decides to perform a CT scan on her brain,

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.569
and the results will be out the next day.

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:11.520
Helen immediately returns home and goes straight
to bed.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.099
In her sleep, she sees fleeting visions of
a female figure.

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:17.460
Helen wakes up to a call from Doctor Headly.

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:21.430
The doctor tells Helen that something strange
has happened to Helen's brain.

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.700
Hearing this, Helen immediately goes to the
hospital.

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.530
There, the doctor explains that they discover
a rare type of tumor in her brain.

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.280
It turns out that another person has lived
in her brain all this time.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.709
Helen's mother, who earlier stabbed herself
in an attempt to end her pregnancy, it turns

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:38.940
out, was carrying twins.

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.220
One of the fetuses was indeed killed in utero,
but was subsequently absorbed into the skull

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.200
of the survivor – Helen.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.370
The car accident Helen suffered earlier somehow
"activated" this long-dormant twin who is

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:54.800
now growing at a rapid rate and is responsible
for Helen's loss of memory and erratic behavior.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.940
She now suffers from a syndrome called "vanishing
twin syndrome" – an actual disorder that

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:03.130
occurs when a twin disappears in the uterus
during pregnancy as a result of a miscarriage

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:04.130
of a twin.

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:07.920
The twin is then absorbed into the body of
the surviving fetus.

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.909
This results in Helen having two different
personas, Helen and her twin sister.

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:16.739
Then, the doctor requires her to undergo surgery
to remove her twin from her brain.

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:20.470
However, she needs to wait three days until
the surgery.

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.010
Later at home, she sees the creepy painting
given by Roman.

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:26.380
The painting suddenly appears on the wall.

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.800
She thinks that Molly was the one putting
it back, but it wasn't.

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.910
She finally decides to return the painting
to Roman.

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:36.350
Arriving at Roman's house, Helen sees no sign
of Roman.

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:40.690
She only sees a footage on a laptop, which
turns out to be Helen, who was torturing Roman

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:42.310
very sadistically.

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.639
The footage shows Roman begging for mercy.

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:48.240
However, unconsciously, Helen killed Roman.

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.410
Helen cannot remember any of those.

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:54.550
After walking around Roman's house, she also
sees broken glass, and she remembers the day

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:56.960
she came home with an injured foot.

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.510
Helen is now convinced that inside her, there
are two personas.

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:05.490
Sometimes, Helen is in control of her body,
but sometimes her twin is in control.

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:09.030
Helen now realizes she is at war with her
own body and mind.

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:13.267
She rushes back home, and begins to tie her
hands and feet to restrain her from going anywhere

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:19.560
The next day, Helen begins to go out for a
walk at night because she is bored at home.

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:24.080
However, she has hallucinations and decides
to go to a nearby toilet.

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.130
She starts to remove her arm cast and opens
the surgical scars on her hands.

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:33.850
She is shocked to see another human finger
in her hand.

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:39.350
Then, she decides to leave that place.

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:44.040
From behind, Molly's boyfriend, Ed, begins
to chase after Helen.

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:46.580
Ed is very interested in the beauty of Helen.

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:48.510
Therefore, he plans to rape her.

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:52.400
At that time, Helen's twin begins to take
control of the body.

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.139
She then points a knife at him, frightening
him.

00:05:55.139 --> 00:05:58.110
She immediately runs back home after regaining
consciousness.

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:03.389
At home, Molly then tells Helen to stop painting
weird, scary pictures.

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:06.741
But Helen reveals that she was not the one
drawing the pictures.

00:06:06.741 --> 00:06:10.520
They have a debate until finally, Helen's
body is taken over by her twin and starts

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:20.070
attacking Molly.

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:23.760
When she regains control, she realizes she
could have hurt Molly.

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:26.880
Eventually, Helen tells Molly to stay away
from her.

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:31.790
However, Molly refuses, so Helen decides to
go away from that place and stay away from

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:32.790
Molly.

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:34.580
On the way, Helen meets Ed.

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:38.699
Ed wants to have revenge because Helen had
pointed a knife at him before.

00:06:38.699 --> 00:06:42.470
Helen begins to explain that she was sick
and that she wasn't the one doing all that.

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:46.190
Ed doesn't listen to Helen, and he plans to
rape Helen.

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:50.808
At the same time, her twin sister starts to
take control of Helen's body and kills Ed instantly.

00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:02.470
After killing Ed, Helen regains her consciousness
and sees that Ed is now dead.

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:07.260
Realizing how dangerous she has become, Helen
plans to commit suicide at the Gemini Motel,

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.960
where her mother had committed suicide years
ago.

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:13.630
Elsewhere, Molly begins to look back at her
photos with Helen.

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:17.300
She observes a significant difference in her
before and after pictures.

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:20.280
She notices a shift in her personality as
well.

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:24.430
She finally concludes that within Helen's
body, there are two different people.

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:26.910
And the one who attacked her was not Helen.

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:30.050
Molly immediately calls Helen to find out
where she is.

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:34.979
Helen says goodbye, revealing that she is
going to commit suicide at the Gemini Motel.

00:07:34.979 --> 00:07:39.390
Hearing this, Molly immediately uses her bike
and go straight to the motel.

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:43.490
When Helen has just arrived at the motel and
about to commit suicide, her twin begins to

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:45.430
take control of her body.

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:46.740
Molly then arrives at the hotel.

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:48.960
However, it is too late.

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:52.080
Her twin has completely controlled Helen's
body.

00:07:52.080 --> 00:08:04.560
She immediately attacks Molly.

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:09.310
Molly tries to defend herself, and eventually,
she is forced to kill Helen.

00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:14.260
In the final shot, Molly begins to walk home,
remembering all her memories with Helen.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.080
And that's how the movie ends.
