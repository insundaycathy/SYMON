00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:02.790
Hello everyone, this is Mr. Brain Junkie here!

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.609
And today we'll be talking about a fantasy
action film called Bleach!

00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:09.430
Be ready for some spoilers ahead!

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:14.310
Somewhere in the country side of Japan, Ichigo
is walking home with his mother on a rainy

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:15.310
day.

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:18.980
The boy sees a young girl in white dress standing
on the edge of the river, and wonders why

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.700
she's there by herself.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:25.110
Ichigo runs to offer the girl help, while
the boy's mother chases him closely behind,

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:26.449
telling him to stop.

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:30.020
Suddenly the girl turns around and causes
ichigo to faint.

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.190
When the boy wakes up, his mother is mortally
wounded after trying to protect him from the

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.350
girl, who turns out to be a vengeful spirit.

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.059
Many years later, Ichigo has grown up to be
a young man, and he's now used to the ability

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.670
of seeing spirits where ever he goes, even
trying to help them whenever he can.

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.739
He goes home that night after school and notices
a strange woman standing in the room as well.

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:56.280
It turns out that she's a soul reaper named
Rukia, and the woman's equally surprised that

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.209
Ichigo can sense her presence.

00:00:58.209 --> 00:01:03.199
Their conversation is interrupted when the
soul reaper feels an evil presence close by,

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:05.880
causing ichigo to run downstairs to his family,

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.100
only to see his sister hiding in the corner
after hearing a scary voice.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.729
Suddenly, an explosion breaks the walls and
a giant hand grabs onto the girl, taking her

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.270
away right in front of the main character.

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.130
Ichigo rushes outside immediately to save
his sister, only to see a large monster standing

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:23.200
in front of him.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.119
The man gets knocked away like it's nothing,
while Rukia charges in and slashes the creature,

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:30.369
forcing it to drop the girl on top of Ichigo.

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:35.070
The woman explains that the monster is an
evil sprit known as a hollow, and it was attracted

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.340
by Ichigo's unusually high spiritual powers.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.390
Before they can finish talking, the creature
attacks Rukia by launching its head, while

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.280
she blocks the monster and barely knocks it
back in time.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.720
She tries to launch her own attacks, but is
quickly captured by the hollow as it charges

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.520
up a large amount of energy in its mouth.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.399
Luckily, Rukia is able break free using her
spells, and knocks the monster flying in the

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:59.920
air, while she drops onto a car.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:05.170
Ichigo runs towards the soul reaper and realizes
that she's badly hurt from the previous fight.

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.550
Rukia tells the man that she has to transfer
her death gods powers to Ichigo by stabbing

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.050
him, so that he may fight the monster and
save their souls.

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.190
Seeing that the creature has recovered so
quickly from the attack, the man has no choice

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.580
but to accept her offer as she stabs him using
her sword.

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.990
The hollow charges forward to attack, but
a shadow slashes the monster and lands closely

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:26.300
behind the giant.

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.610
It turns out that Ichigo has successfully
gained the powers of a soul reaper, as he

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.190
cuts off the spirit's arm in a single strike.

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.540
The monster charges in furiously, but Ichigo
is able to slash the hollow right in the middle,

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.300
splitting the creature in half as it vanishes
from the human world.

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.480
Ichigo wakes up the next day, thinking that
it was all a dream, but is quickly brought

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.070
back to reality after seeing a large hole
on the walls.

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.730
Surprisingly, his family seems to have lost
all their memories of the previous night,

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.790
and thinks that it was truck that broke in.

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.200
The man goes to school like usual, but after
seeing his friends in the classroom, he's

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.650
shocked to see Rukia walk in as well, pretending
to be a new student.

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.980
The girl grabs Ichigo right away and tells
him to not say a word, threatening to kill

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.680
him if he does.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.180
Rukia explains that she can't go back to her
dimension known as the soul society, because

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.200
she accidentally gave all her powers to Ichigo.

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.420
She needs to get them back right away or else
she won't be able to fight any hollows and

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.260
be trapped here forever.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.470
Rukia puts on a special glove and charges
towards Ichigo, pushing his soul out of his

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:30.470
body.

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.900
She grabs onto the man's giant sword and tells
him to stab it into her body, so that he can

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.900
release all his powers into her once again.

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:43.370
Unfortunately, the ritual didn't work as Ichigo's
energy level is apparently very impotent right

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:44.370
now.

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.620
The only way they can successfully transfer
the power is if the main got stronger through

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.350
training, or else his body will not survive
the process.

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:57.160
Ichigo is not very fond of this idea, as he
only wants to go back to his normal life.

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.840
He returns home later that day, only to find
that Rukia is hiding inside his closet as

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.390
she has no where to go.

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:08.460
Ichigo tells her to get out right now, but
she refuses, telling the man to accept his

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:09.460
fate.

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:13.570
Their argument is interrupted by Ichigo's
father, who barges in after hearing a woman's

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:14.570
voice.

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:19.190
He knocks the son away and opens the closet
doors, only to see that it's empty inside.

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:23.660
The father tells Ichigo to not bring any girls
home and warns him about the child supports

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.710
that he'll have to pay, speaking from the
man's own experience after having so many

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:28.890
kids.

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:33.030
Rukia begins training Ichigo the next day,
but the man is barely able to keep up and

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.640
clearly lacks the necessary motivations.

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:40.250
She gives Ichigo a wooden sword, and proceeds
to show him the art of kendo, but the main

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:45.340
character is not able to land even a single
hit as he swings the weapon like a mad man.

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:50.540
At the same time, a soul reaper with red hair
named Renji informs his captain Byakuya that

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.430
they have lost track of Rukia,

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.990
as her spiritual energy has vanished, suggesting
that she gave her powers away.

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:01.130
The captain orders the soul reaper to find
her whereabouts, as giving one's power to

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:03.220
a human is punishable by death.

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:08.530
At night, Ichigo is heading home from school,
but quickly notices a presence following behind

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:09.530
him.

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:13.070
He tells the soul reaper to show himself,
and Renji is surprised that the human can

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:14.370
actually see him.

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:18.740
The reaper demands to know the whereabouts
of Rukia, but Ichigo plays the fool and tries

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:22.490
to protect her, realizing that his friend
may be in trouble.

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:26.500
Renji becomes annoyed at the man's obvious
deceit, drawing his sword and rushing in to

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:27.500
attack.

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:31.950
Luckily, his attempt is quickly stopped by
a flying arrow that grazes over the reaper's

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:35.770
head, forcing him to hide, and giving Ichigo
the chance to escape.

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:39.950
The main character goes home and tells Rukia
about the other reaper, demanding to know

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:44.190
the truth, but the girl only tells him that
he has to train, or else he'll definitely

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:45.190
be killed.

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:49.920
The next day, Ichigo is confront by a man
in glasses named Ishida, who seems to know

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:51.960
about his soul reaper powers.

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:56.680
The man reveals that he also has unique powers
just like Ichigo, because he's from a tribe

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:00.250
known as the Quincy, who were mostly wiped
out by soul reapers.

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:05.700
Ishida shows the ability that that he possess
as he forms a bow using spiritual energy,

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:08.560
revealing that he was the one who saved Ichigo
last night.

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:13.090
He demands Ichigo to fight him in order to
avenge his people from the reapers, but the

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:15.620
man refuses even after being threatened.

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:20.010
With no other choice, Ishida plan to lure
out the hollows and force Ichigo to fight

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:22.830
by throwing a bait into the cities below.

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:27.020
Rukia senses the presence of evil spirits
and rushes towards Ichigo, forcing him to

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:30.260
become a soul reaper so that he can protect
the innocent people.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:34.710
They rush towards the park, only to see the
soul of a boy that he saved earlier being

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:37.370
chased by a giant spider like monster.

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:41.930
Ichigo runs at the creature and attacks furiously
by using his giant sword, but the monster

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:46.240
is able to evade quickly, not allowing him
to land any effective hits.

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:50.669
The reaper is also able to dodge the attacks
from the monster as he runs desperately away

00:06:50.669 --> 00:06:52.380
from the giant legs.

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:57.169
Eventually, Ichigo becomes tired and lowers
his guard, causing the hollow to land a strike

00:06:57.169 --> 00:06:59.889
that knocks the reaper flying across the field.

00:06:59.889 --> 00:07:04.270
Before the monster can finish the kill, it's
quickly cut in half by Renji, who's located

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:07.360
them by tracking their spiritual energies.

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:10.920
He turns towards Ichigo and rushes forward
using incredible speed, pointing his sword

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:13.889
towards the man before any reactions can occur.

00:07:13.889 --> 00:07:17.699
Ichigo tries hitting back, but is knocked
flying towards a tree and quickly disabled

00:07:17.699 --> 00:07:19.949
by a devastating kick in the face.

00:07:19.949 --> 00:07:24.570
Before Renji can finish the man off, Rukia
rushes in and tells him stop, but this only

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:29.150
angers the reaper as he can't understand why
she wants to protect a lowly human.

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:33.340
Their arguments are interrupted when captain
Byakuya appears in front of them and reveals

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:35.490
that he's actually Rukia's brother.

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:39.790
He demands the girl to take her power from
Ichigo even if it means killing the man, as

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:43.900
this is the only way that her crimes can forgiven
by the soul society.

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:48.510
Rukia refuses as she doesn't believe in killing
a human who's innocent, especially since it

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:51.320
was her who put him in the current situation.

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:55.840
Seeing his sister's resolve, Byakuya gives
her until the next full moon to regain her

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:58.520
powers, or they'll kill Ichigo themselves.

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:02.660
Rukia quickly brings her friend back to his
body and heals him using her special herbs,

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:07.729
but Ichigo is unsure of what they can do next,
as the power difference is clearly too great.

00:08:07.729 --> 00:08:12.840
As time goes on, Rukia also realizes that
Ichigo will never be ready, especially after

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:15.229
the damage he took from the previous fight.

00:08:15.229 --> 00:08:19.650
She decides to gamble their chances by striking
a deal with her brother, telling the man that

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:24.400
they'll use Ichigo as bait to lure out a massive
hollow known as the Grand Fisher.

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:28.580
Rukia promises to slay the monster in order
to amend her crimes, and begs her brother

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:30.570
to spare Ichigo's life.

00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:34.820
Despite the woman's pleads, her brother refuses
to grant her wish, and instead questions her

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:36.909
loyalty towards her family.

00:08:36.909 --> 00:08:41.269
Renji becomes furious at Rukia's continuous
defiance, calling Ichigo nothing more than

00:08:41.269 --> 00:08:43.459
trash and not worthy to be saved.

00:08:43.459 --> 00:08:47.680
Their arguments are interrupted by Ichigo
who shouts for them to stop, after following

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:49.430
his friend to their location.

00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:54.300
He agrees that he'll slay the Grand Fisher,
only if they promise to let Rukia go.

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:58.629
Renji decides to attack Ichigo right away,
but surprisingly, his captain stops him and

00:08:58.629 --> 00:09:02.420
takes the deal, believing that the man would
be killed as a result.

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:07.310
Ichigo begins training with Rukia, and this
time he takes it very seriously unlike before,

00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:11.689
as he wants prove his capabilities and most
importantly, to protect his friend.

00:09:11.689 --> 00:09:15.730
The man is able to improve dramatically in
a short amount of time, even learning how

00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:18.779
to control his spiritual pressure and use
it as a weapon.

00:09:18.779 --> 00:09:22.680
They begins to look for the grand fisher,
as the monster should have picked up ichigo's

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:24.490
increase of spiritual energy.

00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:28.749
The two follows the trails and arrive to see
a giant monster that eventually morphs into

00:09:28.749 --> 00:09:33.379
the little girl that killed Ichigo's mother,
implying that they are the same creature.

00:09:33.379 --> 00:09:37.559
Ichigo transforms into a soul reapers and
charges at the hollow, slashing it's tentacles

00:09:37.559 --> 00:09:39.459
furiously using his sword.

00:09:39.459 --> 00:09:43.911
He leaps forward and stabs the monster right
in the center, but soon notices that his mother

00:09:43.911 --> 00:09:48.170
was the one who took the damage from the attack,
as the woman appears in front of him.

00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:52.300
The man's inner guilt becomes the illusion
created by the monster, and he barely escapes

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:54.550
the attack in time thank to Rukia.

00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:59.420
The hollow finally morphs into its true form
which resembles a giant beast, prompting Ichigo

00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:02.589
to charge in with anger, trying to avenge
his mother.

00:10:02.589 --> 00:10:07.269
The two arrives inside the city, and the monster
causes tremendous damage as it chases after

00:10:07.269 --> 00:10:10.189
the soul reaper, destroying everything on
site.

00:10:10.189 --> 00:10:14.720
The creature crashes into buildings and tosses
the people around, ravaging the entire city

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:16.689
as it tries to devour Ichigo.

00:10:16.689 --> 00:10:20.779
The soul reaper tries desperately to avoid
the monster, but it's tentacles are difficult

00:10:20.779 --> 00:10:24.389
to evade, forcing Ichigo to constantly defend
for his life.

00:10:24.389 --> 00:10:28.790
The hollow is able to eventually grab onto
the man using its claws, trying to crush the

00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:33.089
reaper under it's tremendous weight, but Ichigo
refuses to give up the fight.

00:10:33.089 --> 00:10:37.619
Suddenly, an arrow is shot at the monster
and knocks it away from the man, revealing

00:10:37.619 --> 00:10:39.869
that Ishida is here to help as well.

00:10:39.869 --> 00:10:44.259
The Quincy dodges the creature's attacks and
fires numerous arrows, but the hollow is able

00:10:44.259 --> 00:10:45.870
to deflect them easily.

00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:50.149
While distracted, Ichigo charges at the monster
and runs underneath, cutting the creature

00:10:50.149 --> 00:10:51.310
from below.

00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:56.120
However, this seems to have only angered the
evil spirit as it screams furiously at the

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:58.480
sky, causing a giant tornado to form.

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:03.269
It strikes at both of them, forcing Ichigo
to hide inside a bus to avoid the attacks.

00:11:03.269 --> 00:11:07.899
The monster follows the man and proceeds to
attack the reaper from the outside, eventually

00:11:07.899 --> 00:11:11.339
grabbing onto Ichigo and lifting the entire
bus at the same time.

00:11:11.339 --> 00:11:15.399
Ishida aims at the monster and shoots the
arrow, managing to strike the hollow right

00:11:15.399 --> 00:11:16.399
on the eye.

00:11:16.399 --> 00:11:20.660
The creature becomes furious and rips the
bus into pieces, but also giving Ichigo the

00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:25.139
chance to strike from above and splitting
the monster's head, finally avenging his mother's

00:11:25.139 --> 00:11:26.139
death.

00:11:26.139 --> 00:11:30.249
The hollow scream in agony as it falls down
on the ground, vanishing quickly into thin

00:11:30.249 --> 00:11:31.249
air.

00:11:31.249 --> 00:11:34.820
Rukia rushes towards her friend to makes sure
that he's alright, while Ichigo returns her

00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:36.529
warmness with a smile.

00:11:36.529 --> 00:11:41.089
However, before they can celebrate, Ishida
is stabbed in the back by Renji, who's here

00:11:41.089 --> 00:11:43.980
to finish the main character despite their
previous deal.

00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:49.069
Byakuya gives the girl a final chance to redeem
herself and orders her to kill Ichigo, stating

00:11:49.069 --> 00:11:51.619
the soul reapers should never befriend a human.

00:11:51.619 --> 00:11:56.699
No matter how much her brother tries to convince
her, Rukia is not able to give up her friend,

00:11:56.699 --> 00:11:59.749
causing the captain to order Renji to exterminate
both of them.

00:11:59.749 --> 00:12:03.870
The soul reaper charges at Ichigo with the
intent to kill, forcing the man to defend

00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:06.339
himself and Rukia at the same time.

00:12:06.339 --> 00:12:10.959
Renji's attacks are too fast and vicious for
Ichigo to fend off continuously, eventually

00:12:10.959 --> 00:12:13.250
sending him crashing towards the cars,

00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:17.939
but unlike before, he's finally able to see
the reaper's movements, making victory now

00:12:17.939 --> 00:12:19.679
a possibility.

00:12:19.679 --> 00:12:23.769
Ichigo charges towards the enemy and the they
continue to exchange a barrage of strikes,

00:12:23.769 --> 00:12:28.999
but the man is quickly forced into a defense,
not being able to counter any of the attacks.

00:12:28.999 --> 00:12:32.949
Renji knocks Ichigo around and forces him
backwards, but this time he's able to throw

00:12:32.949 --> 00:12:36.779
the enemy away and eventually lands a kick
on the reaper's body.

00:12:36.779 --> 00:12:41.329
Renji becomes furious and strikes back immediately,
kicking ichigo in the face and knocking him

00:12:41.329 --> 00:12:43.459
away using a devastating strike.

00:12:43.459 --> 00:12:48.139
The soul reaper decides to finally show his
true power by releasing his sword Zabimaru

00:12:48.139 --> 00:12:51.970
into the second form, and launching the weapon
towards Ichigo like spring.

00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:56.550
The man dodges the attacks desperately as
he runs for his life, not being able to adjust

00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:58.769
to the increased range from the enemy.

00:12:58.769 --> 00:13:03.239
Renji eventually grabs onto Ichigo using his
sword and tosses the man away like a ragdoll

00:13:03.239 --> 00:13:04.759
into the piles cars.

00:13:04.759 --> 00:13:10.069
The reaper then throws a vehicle at Ichigo,
causing a large explosion upon impact, burning

00:13:10.069 --> 00:13:11.439
everything in sight.

00:13:11.439 --> 00:13:15.990
Before Renji's about to finish off Rukia,
Ichigo emerges from the chaos to everyone's

00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:20.110
surprise, and assures the reaper that he won't
be defeated so easily.

00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:23.829
Ichigo charges towards Renji and deflects
the attacks from the enemy, cutting through

00:13:23.829 --> 00:13:27.079
the reaper's weapon and sents him crashing
into a bus.

00:13:27.079 --> 00:13:31.160
Seeing that his man's is clearly defeated,
Byakuya decides to join the fight and tells

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:32.790
Renji to retreat.

00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:36.850
Ichigo runs forward and slashes at the captain,
but the soul reaper disappears in front of

00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:39.809
him and grabs onto his sword using only two
fingers.

00:13:39.809 --> 00:13:44.899
The man tries to attack again, but is quickly
cut in the stomach by the captain and falls

00:13:44.899 --> 00:13:46.069
towards the ground.

00:13:46.069 --> 00:13:50.199
Surprisingly, before the captain leaves, Ichigo
manages to get up and attacks once more, but

00:13:50.199 --> 00:13:53.249
his weapon is quickly stopped and he's cut
down with blinding speed.

00:13:53.249 --> 00:13:58.119
Not matter how many times Ichigo falls, he
refuses to stay down as he needs to protect

00:13:58.119 --> 00:13:59.889
Rukia no matter the cost.

00:13:59.889 --> 00:14:05.079
Byakuya becomes frustrated at the man's stubbornness
and strikes him a final time across the face,

00:14:05.079 --> 00:14:07.230
knocking Ichigo to ground once more.

00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:11.970
Amazingly, the man refuses to give up and
grabs onto the captain, telling him that it's

00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:12.970
not over.

00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:17.720
The reaper become furious and finally decides
to kill Ichigo himself, but Rukia saves the

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:20.790
man by knocking him away, calling him a lowly
human.

00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:24.689
She strikes her friend and prevents him from
getting up, telling Ichigo that she's tired

00:14:24.689 --> 00:14:28.209
of him, while trying desperately to hold back
her tears.

00:14:28.209 --> 00:14:32.160
Rukia promises her brother that she'll go
back to soul society and be judged for her

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:35.059
sins, so that they don't have to kill any
more people.

00:14:35.059 --> 00:14:39.399
The woman takes Ichigo's sword and stabs it
into herself, taking away the man's power

00:14:39.399 --> 00:14:41.870
as everything turns into white.

00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:45.829
Ichigo wakes up the next day, with all his
wounds gone and feeling like everything was

00:14:45.829 --> 00:14:46.829
a dream.

00:14:46.829 --> 00:14:50.649
He goes back to school and sees all his friends,
but senses that someone very important is

00:14:50.649 --> 00:14:51.649
missing.

00:14:51.649 --> 00:14:55.920
He opens the textbook inside desk and sees
the writings from Rukia, causing him smile

00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:58.139
once again.

00:14:58.139 --> 00:14:59.999
