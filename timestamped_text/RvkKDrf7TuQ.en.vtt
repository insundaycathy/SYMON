00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:05.280
Welcome to Thriller Recapped, Today, I&nbsp;
will show you an American Psychological&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:10.000
Thriller film called “One Hour Photo”,&nbsp;
Spoilers Ahead, watch out and take care.&nbsp;

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:17.120
The movie starts with Seymour Parrish, he is&nbsp;
a photo technician at a local studio called,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:23.920
One Hour Photo, he is in police custody, Detective&nbsp;
James Van, reads him his rights, and then he tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.960
him that police checked the camera roll, and they&nbsp;
found disturbing pictures in it. The Detective&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.760
asks further, that is it about, William Yorkin,&nbsp;
that provoked you to do this horrendous act.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.880
In flashback, we see a birthday&nbsp;
party celebration, Seymour quotes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.520
no one wants to take a photograph&nbsp;
of something they want to forget.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.800
A couple is seen, Nina Yorkin, and her husband,&nbsp;
William Yorkin, who is busy working on a project,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:55.120
and their son, Jake Yorkin, seem to be a happy&nbsp;
family. Seymour is working on photographs at,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.160
One Hour Photo Studio. While Nina is checking&nbsp;
out the photo rolls she just purchased,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.120
he goes and gives her home address to the&nbsp;
cashier, even before she says it, it seems&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:10.800
like as if he memorized it. She bought a digital&nbsp;
camera as well, and he cracks a joke about it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:16.560
that he will be out of the job if everyone started&nbsp;
using a digital camera. She has one picture roll&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.560
left in her camera and he does not want to throw&nbsp;
it, so he takes his picture with the camera.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.560
The store closes in 40 minutes, but he says she&nbsp;
is their best customer so he will develop films&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:32.400
for her before closing. Inside the lab, his&nbsp;
colleague, Yoshi, is working on some stuff.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.640
Seymour starts developing films as he quotes&nbsp;
in the background, he lives only for his work,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.800
and he considers that his work is a vital service.&nbsp;
He further quotes, people think that anyone can do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:50.800
his job with 1 or 2 days of training, but his&nbsp;
job require skills that are far beyond the eye.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:56.960
I process these photos as if they were my own.&nbsp;
Nina arrives there, and he hands her the pictures,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.920
he also gives her discount, along with a mini&nbsp;
camera for free as a gift for Birthday Boy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.680
He notices a book in her&nbsp;
Shopping Bag, before she leaves.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.240
Later that night, his shift ends, and he goes&nbsp;
outside, there he finds out that windshield&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.600
of his car is cracked. At Nina’s home, the&nbsp;
family is enjoying their evening by looking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.320
at the pictures of Birthday Party, William comes&nbsp;
across the picture Seymour took in the store.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.760
In a restaurant, Seymour is looking at the same&nbsp;
set of pictures, and he is appreciating the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.800
moments, it turns out, he made a set of copy for&nbsp;
himself as well when developing the films earlier.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.320
The waitress asks him, whose pictures he is&nbsp;
looking at, and he claims they are his family&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:43.520
pictures, she looks at the pictures and she says,&nbsp;
you got a beautiful family, and then she leaves.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:50.000
Then he drives back to his home, Jake is sad&nbsp;
because he realized Seymour is all alone,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.360
he does not have any friends, and everyone&nbsp;
bullies him at the store about it, she assures him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.800
he probably has a lot of friends and a girlfriend&nbsp;
as well, since he is a nice guy, they should send&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.560
him good thoughts and manifest that next&nbsp;
time when they see him, he won’t look sad.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:10.800
Later, Seymour gives his hamster some water, we&nbsp;
can see the family pictures of Yorkin family,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:16.080
in the background. William is arguing about&nbsp;
the expenses of his wife, that she bought a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:21.440
new Mercedes, and she needs to stop living the&nbsp;
life as if they live in a fairy tale, then she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:27.280
claims that it’s not about money, and William is&nbsp;
bad husband, and a bad father, then she leaves.

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.760
Later that night, Seymour is alone in his&nbsp;
room, and he is watching, The Simpsons,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.600
then we see a crazy wall, full&nbsp;
of pictures sticked to it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.920
it turns out, it has all the pictures, showing&nbsp;
the moments that the family ever shared.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:48.880
The next day, Seymour gets back to work, he&nbsp;
quotes, Monday is the busiest day in their store,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.800
people tend to take more pictures on&nbsp;
weekend, he further mentions a lady,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:59.360
she only takes pictures of her cats, and he never&nbsp;
saw one human being in her pictures. Then he says&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:04.240
when a new baby is born, the parents go crazy and&nbsp;
they take tons of pictures, which is good for the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:10.160
store. Then a Cornstar comes up, he always&nbsp;
takes pictures of women, in an artistic way.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:16.960
Later, man named, Larry, a technician is there&nbsp;
to fix some issues in the printing machine, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:21.920
he makes fun of Seymour, because he called him for&nbsp;
a very small error in the color developing system,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:27.440
showing us how Seymour is careful and&nbsp;
perfect in his job. It’s his lunch break,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.760
and he finished his meal, and he is looking&nbsp;
at the Christmas picture of Yorkin family.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:38.240
He visions himself there in the celebration.&nbsp;
The manager named, Bill Owens, interrupts him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.360
he advices him not to yell in front of customers&nbsp;
at anyone, even if the guy was at fault,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:49.600
since it creates an uncomfortable environment. He&nbsp;
then suggests him to take some time off from work,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:54.000
and enjoy his life, since Seymour never&nbsp;
went to any vacations, and he leaves.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:00.720
Later that day, William comes to the store,&nbsp;
and Seymour recognizes him, and he introduces&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.520
himself to him. William is in rush, and he&nbsp;
needs some help with computer accessories.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:11.360
So, Seymour makes an announcement for&nbsp;
assistance. Manager looks at him from the top,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:16.800
Seymour tells him he has a beautiful house and&nbsp;
a wonderful family, and he is a very lucky man,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:21.280
William is shocked at first but then he&nbsp;
takes it as a compliment and they both leave,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:27.520
only to come across Jake, Jake shows him a Star&nbsp;
Wars toy, and he tells him how much he likes the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:33.280
toy, and he leaves. Later that day, Seymour is&nbsp;
reading the same book Nina got few days ago,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:38.400
when she went there for photos. Seymour&nbsp;
then walks in a market as he quotes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:42.640
people don’t realize these snapshots&nbsp;
are their only chance to stop time,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:47.840
for a blink of an eye, as a picture. And these&nbsp;
pictures are the only proof of their existence,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:54.080
and their memory to stay forever. He buys an&nbsp;
old picture of a woman. He quotes further that,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:58.400
people don’t take pictures of small details in&nbsp;
their life, and they miss out on so many things.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:04.000
He then manages to break inside the family home,&nbsp;
and he looks at his picture on their fridge,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.840
he is full of joy. Then he takes a poo in their&nbsp;
toilet. He then watches a game in their living&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:15.280
room and enjoys it. Nina and the family get&nbsp;
back to home, he is caught, and he is scared,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:20.800
but the family behaves as if he is part of&nbsp;
their family, and Jakes goes to him saying Uncle&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:26.240
Seymour. He then drives off from there, to realize&nbsp;
it was his vision of a family he never got.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:32.560
The next day, a woman named, Maya,&nbsp;
arrives to the store, he likes her name,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:36.800
and she says she won’t be able to collect&nbsp;
the pictures till tomorrow and she leaves.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:41.440
Jake is having his soccer practice; the&nbsp;
coach is not happy with his performance.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:47.840
However, Seymour waves in the background and he&nbsp;
cheers him. Jake goes to him, and they talk a bit,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:53.920
Seymour cheers him further about his shot. Then he&nbsp;
walks him to the home, and shares his life story&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:59.520
with him, how he used to be fat, and nobody&nbsp;
spoke to him. He then learns that Jake’s dad&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:04.800
never showed up at his soccer practice. He then&nbsp;
gives him the Star Wars toy Jake liked earlier.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:09.760
Jake denies it, since, his parents&nbsp;
won’t let him have it, and he leaves.

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:17.280
Later that day, Seymour notices Nina in the food&nbsp;
court, so he goes to her, and he sits next to her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:23.120
Then they talk a bit, and she invites him to sit&nbsp;
with her, Seymour compliments about her son Jake,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:29.040
and he tells her how he feels like as if he is&nbsp;
the uncle of Jake. She is busy and she prepares&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:35.200
to leave, so he opens the book, and he pretends&nbsp;
to read it. Nina sits back, and she is shocked&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:40.640
to see him having an interest in the same book.&nbsp;
He reads one quote from the book, The things we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:46.080
fear the most, have already happened to us. She&nbsp;
is impressed by his deep-thinking personality,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:50.480
they talk a bit, and she learns that he is&nbsp;
single, and he does not have any family,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:56.400
only a picture of his mother. He then shows her&nbsp;
the picture he bought from the market. There is a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:02.560
charming smile on her face, and she leaves. The&nbsp;
next day, Seymour is working in the warehouse,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:07.120
and the manager calls him for a talk.&nbsp;
Owens is suspicious about the excessive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:11.840
use of printing material more than required,&nbsp;
and after a brief investigation with Larry,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:18.000
he found out that Seymour has used hundreds of&nbsp;
extra developing films, so he decides to fire him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.520
on the basis of fraud. Further saying they’re not&nbsp;
running a charity here, that Seymour gave away a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:29.200
free camera on a birthday. The manager orders him&nbsp;
to pack his stuff, and this is his last week, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:35.040
he also threatens him not to ruin any prints while&nbsp;
working in his last days, Seymour rages up and he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:39.840
claims that in his work history of 11 years, he&nbsp;
never ruined even one picture of any customer.

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:44.320
Few hours later, he comes across&nbsp;
a blank picture on the floor.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:50.720
Nina interrupts him and she is there to process&nbsp;
the films, of Jake’s Birthday camera, they notice&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:56.240
his sad demeanour, and he asks her for her home&nbsp;
address, it seems he is in shock to the point,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:01.520
he forgot the address of his favourite family.&nbsp;
Nina feels he is not alright, and she leaves.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:06.400
Inside the lab, Seymour is being harsh&nbsp;
on the camera, and he slams it open,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:10.400
while he is looking at the pictures,&nbsp;
he is happy with the pictures,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:14.880
but he breaks down soon, knowing this will&nbsp;
be the last time he developed their pictures.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:19.360
He then gets back to home, and he starts&nbsp;
examining the pictures on the wall.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:24.960
He then gets back to the store early in&nbsp;
the morning, and he opens the file of Maya,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:30.000
as he goes through it, he finds out that maya&nbsp;
took some intimate pictures with William,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.520
the husband of Nina, and he realizes that he&nbsp;
is cheating on her, he is in disbelief and his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:40.960
heart breaks, realizing his conception of Yorkin’s&nbsp;
family as a perfect family shattered into pieces.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:45.680
Later, he deliberately places the&nbsp;
pictures of William and his mistress Maya,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:51.360
into the packet of Nina, and he leaves early&nbsp;
from work, saying goodbye to his friend Yoshi,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:56.160
and revealing it to him, that he is fired,&nbsp;
Yoshi thanks him for teaching him the stuff,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:56.160 --> 00:10:01.360
and Seymour tells him to run the place with&nbsp;
hard work. As Seymour walks from there he seems&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:06.480
to be thinking about something, he then takes a&nbsp;
knife out of the case, and he leaves from there.

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:11.200
He then goes undercover, and he&nbsp;
starts taking pictures of Nina,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:16.880
paparazzi style, he follows Nina’s car and&nbsp;
sooner, Nina recklessly pulls over on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:22.720
side of the road, it turns out Nina just saw the&nbsp;
pictures of William and Maya, she’s in disbelief&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:28.160
and pain. He then spies on them that night, he is&nbsp;
waiting for them to fight, but nothing happens,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:35.120
so he rages up aggressively and he leaves. He gets&nbsp;
back to home; he looks at the wall of pictures&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:40.640
that he used to cherish and mesmerize. He then&nbsp;
gets a dream, he is standing alone in the store,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:48.480
and shockingly his eyes start bleeding crazily.&nbsp;
He wakes up and he takes a shower. The next day,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:53.600
he goes out, in the background he quotes that,&nbsp;
the word snapshot originated from the people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:57.360
who used to take pictures of birds,&nbsp;
and it was originally a hunting term.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:01.760
He then gets back to the mall,&nbsp;
The manager asks him to leave,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:06.960
but Seymour creates a scene that there is no law,&nbsp;
that can deny him from shopping at that mall,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:14.080
then the manager gives a gesture to the security&nbsp;
guard. Later, he is spying on William and Maya.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:18.080
In the studio, Yoshi goes to the manager,&nbsp;
and he shows him the envelope of Seymour,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:22.560
it turns out he also spied on his young&nbsp;
daughter and sent her pictures as a threat.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:28.160
The manager then calls Detective James, and they&nbsp;
talk about the safety of his wife and child.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:32.960
The detective assures him that they will&nbsp;
take this as an indirect threat to the child,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:37.840
and there are already 2 officers sent to&nbsp;
proctor him, also they already issued a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:42.400
search warrant for Seymour’s apartment. Then&nbsp;
a group of officers go to his apartment,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:47.600
they come across the wall of pictures, and they&nbsp;
notice that face of William is scratched off,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:54.480
from every single picture on the wall. Seymour&nbsp;
goes to a hotel, he pretends to be a family member&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:54.480 --> 00:12:00.160
and he asks to talk to Maya on the phone, when the&nbsp;
call is transferred to her, he pretends to be room&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:05.360
service and asks for her room number and takes an&nbsp;
order for some drinks, he then calls back to front&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:10.480
desk, and pretends to be William and informs them&nbsp;
that they don’t need any room service for the day.

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:15.760
Meanwhile, Detective James go to Nina’s&nbsp;
home, and they want to speak with William,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:20.720
but she says William went for an urgent&nbsp;
meeting. Seymour goes to front desk,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:26.480
and he books a room on the 5th floor, where&nbsp;
William is staying. Another detective suggests&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:32.640
Nina should call William’s office. Seymour&nbsp;
walks to the room 511, where William is staying,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:38.160
and he covers the spyhole of the door. Then&nbsp;
he knocks, and pretends to be room service,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:42.960
and he pushes the door and gets in, they both&nbsp;
were about to have a spicy hormone sandwich,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:48.640
he is armed with a knife. He forces the lovers&nbsp;
to get back in the bed, and he orders them to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:55.200
take the robe off. Nina is at home trying to call&nbsp;
William. He then forces them to pose for pictures,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:55.840 --> 00:13:02.160
and he forces Maya to pretend as if she’s eating&nbsp;
the sausage, while he takes the pictures. He then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:06.640
gets back to his hotel room; he is laying&nbsp;
in the bed while thinking about something.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:13.120
Both the detectives arrive to the hotel, and they&nbsp;
inquire about Seymour, then they both go to his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:19.600
room, and they knock. They get inside but they&nbsp;
find it empty, with the knife in the sink, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:26.160
camera near the bed. Seymour escapes from there&nbsp;
through the kitchen to an emergency exit. The exit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:32.320
door trips an alarm, he runs from there in sports&nbsp;
mode, some officers catch up with him, right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:38.000
before he leaves the building. Meanwhile, the&nbsp;
other detective goes to William and Maya, and he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:44.480
finds them without any physical harm. Police makes&nbsp;
an arrest, and he says, I just took pictures.

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:51.520
The officers bring William back to the house,&nbsp;
Jake hugs him. Nina seems little impressed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:56.960
and she looks at him silently. Back to&nbsp;
the present, Seymour asks the detective,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:56.960 --> 00:14:02.800
if he has family, the detective says, it’s none of&nbsp;
your business, but Seymour observes from the way&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:08.240
he handled him and the ring on detective’s finger&nbsp;
that he is a good man, and a good husband, maybe a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:13.840
good father as well, full of fortune, not someone&nbsp;
who cheats on his wife and betray their trust,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:18.320
and that he would never take sick, and degrading&nbsp;
pictures of your children doing these things.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:25.360
Suggesting that Seymour’s own father exploited&nbsp;
him for child corn. The detective says, I think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:30.320
I understand you now sir, and he leaves, Seymour&nbsp;
requests that he wants to see the pictures,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:35.600
and it turns out Seymour took pictures of&nbsp;
furniture instead of William and Maya posing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:40.080
Then the film ends with a family picture&nbsp;
of Yorkin’s family and Seymour in it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:44.720
smiling. Rest in Peace "Robin&nbsp;
Williams", you’ll always be remembered.
