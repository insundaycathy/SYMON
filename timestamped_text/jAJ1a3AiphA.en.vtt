00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.500
Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.980
Today, I'm going to explain an action, mystery,
sci-fi film called "Sphere."

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:07.270
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:09.050
Watch out and take care.

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.750
When the U.S. Navy discovers an unidentified
vessel under the Pacific Ocean, they assemble

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.070
a team of experts to investigate the craft.

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.440
A psychologist named Dr. Norman Goodman arrives
on a ship in the middle of the ocean, thinking

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.810
he'll be treating plane crash survivors, but
he's puzzled when he sees a few familiar faces.

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.810
As navy personnel takes him to his quarters,
he comes across Dr. Ted Fielding, a physicist,

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.950
and Dr. Beth Halperin, a marine biologist.

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:36.250
After waiting for three hours, U.S. Navy Capt.
Harold Barnes knocks on his doors to take

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:37.609
him to the briefing room.

00:00:37.609 --> 00:00:40.879
Along the way, Barnes tells Norman that they
have found a spacecraft.

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:44.379
Barnes hints that Norman was contacted because
of a report he wrote on Unidentified Life

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:47.549
Forms, noting that the document has become
their bible.

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:50.620
Inside the briefing room, Barnes informs the
team that the spacecraft was buried under

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.109
eight yards of coral.

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:54.980
Beth estimates from the coral growth that
the ship has been under the ocean for about

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.090
300 years.

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:01.459
Dr. Harry Adams, a mathematician, deduces
that the vessel crashed in 1709.

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:04.680
The Navy believes that there could be a life
form inside the ship, so they contacted the

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.570
group because they were mentioned in Norman's
report about the effects of an alien invasion.

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.079
Beth will assess the physiology of the U.L.F.,
while Harry would attempt communication with

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:14.000
the aliens via mathematics.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.259
Fielding will try to determine the alien's
location in outer space, while Norman will

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:21.070
help them deal with stressful situations when
they come across the U.L.F.

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.630
Barnes notifies them that the Navy's sonar
has detected a low-level hum, indicating that

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.770
something is running inside the craft.

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.759
Harry has some apprehensions about going to
the spacecraft, but Ted tells him that it

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.920
will be the most significant discovery since
Copernicus.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.049
Before going underwater, Norman apologizes
to Harry for putting his name in the report.

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.249
Norman discloses that he just picked the names
of people he knew when he wrote it.

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:43.399
He confesses that his report was bogus, but
he couldn't tell Barnes because he will be

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:45.020
indicted for fraud.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.719
Harry agrees to keep his secret.

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:50.609
Soon, a submarine takes them to the Habitat,
a structure assembled by the Navy to serve

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:53.130
as a base while they investigate the spacecraft.

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.200
When they get near the bottom, Ted is astonished
by the size of the spacecraft.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.560
Outside the Habitat, a navy dive team is preparing
a robot to open the doors to the spaceship.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.249
The team leaves the Habitat and walks toward
the spaceship.

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:07.950
When they get to the airlock, they couldn't
get it open, so Ted uses a hammer and a chisel

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.069
to pry it open.

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:11.920
Harry notices the chip on the door after Ted
forces it open.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.080
He's baffled that the craft, made of a strong
titanium alloy, wasn't damaged by the crash,

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.959
yet it chips when Ted strikes it with simple
tools.

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.760
Beth notices heat emanating from the door,
so Barnes prompts them to get back.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.540
The team is surprised when the door opens
by itself.

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.349
When they get in, Barnes tells them to keep
their helmets on.

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:31.870
Soon, Beth notices some footprints on the
floor and concludes that someone has been

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:32.890
there.

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.140
The team splits up into two squads to explore
more of the craft.

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.340
After separating from the rest of the team,
Norman confesses to Beth that he made up the

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.569
report and borrowed some of the concepts from
writers like Rod Serling and Isaac Asimov.

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:46.580
When they step onto a platform, it takes them
to another floor.

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.870
Beth screams in shock when she comes across
a corpse sitting on a chair.

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.099
She concludes that it is human, and it died
from blunt force trauma.

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:56.480
They see him holding a snack called "Smokehouse
Almonds," so they assume they must be inside

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.110
an American spaceship.

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.900
When Beth starts tinkering with a console,
she discovers that the records are in English.

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.420
On the flight logs, they notice an item marked
"Unknown Entry Event."

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.760
When they press it, a hologram appears, showing
a spaceship entering a black hole.

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.740
When Norman reports what they've discovered,
Barnes tells them that they've found something

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:13.740
even more mind-boggling.

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:17.570
Barnes takes them to the cargo hold, where
they find a massive sphere.

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.769
Barnes suspects that the strange object could
be a trap, so he tells them that he'll put

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:22.299
a video camera on it.

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:25.989
As they stare at it, Norman notices that the
team is not showing up on the sphere's reflective

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:27.200
surface.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.730
Back inside the Habitat, they discuss how
an American spaceship with advanced technology

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.590
ended up in the bottom of the ocean.

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.099
Ted surmises that the spacecraft didn't crash,
noting the lack of damage.

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:39.640
He believes that it got caught into a black
hole and arrived 300 years ago from another

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:40.640
time.

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.989
Barnes notifies them that there's a storm
on the surface, so they have to go back up.

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:47.239
Ted still wants to explore the spacecraft,
but Barnes points out that they didn't find

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:49.989
any U.L.F., so they are no longer needed.

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:52.989
Inside their quarters, Harry predicts that
they're probably going to die before they

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:54.189
reach the surface.

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:57.299
He thinks that the computer flight log recorded
the ship's descent into the black hole as

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:01.220
an unknown entry event because the team could
not report their discovery to the Navy.

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.880
As he goes to bed, he expresses his wish to
get inside the sphere.

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.269
Before the team could return to the surface,
the alarm suddenly goes off.

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:11.879
When Barnes looks at the video monitors, he
sees Harry approaching the sphere.

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:14.530
Norman tells Barnes about Harry's wish to
go inside.

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.450
While Harry stares at the shining ball, his
reflection becomes visible on the surface.

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:22.670
Barnes suddenly notices that Harry has disappeared,
but it didn't seem like he entered the sphere.

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:25.640
Barnes tells Norman that they won't return
to the surface until they get Harry back from

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.320
the spacecraft.

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.870
Norman wears a diving suit and enters the
spacecraft.

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.240
As he stares at the sphere, he suddenly sees
Harry appear on the ground.

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.410
He tries to wake Harry up, but Harry doesnâ€™t
respond even though his vital signs are normal.

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:40.890
When Norman looks up at the object again,
he sees his reflection emerge.

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:43.960
The lights at the station suddenly go out
and the video feed from the spacecraft gets

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:44.960
cut.

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.110
When it goes back up, Barnes realizes that
they are running on internal power, which

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:50.250
means that the submarine has turned back.

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.150
He tells the team that they're going to be
staying there for a while.

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.210
Norman takes Harry back to the Habitat, still
unconscious.

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:59.940
As the crew waits to hear from the surface,
Fletcher, a navy personnel assigned to maintain

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:03.870
the Habitat, takes a video storage unit to
the mini-sub to reset the timer.

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:07.010
Barnes explains to Ted that they have to press
the reset button every 12 hours to let the

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:09.070
Navy know that they are still alive.

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:13.270
If the timer doesn't reset, the mini-sub will
automatically go up to the surface.

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:16.590
After resetting the timer on the mini-sub,
she notices numerous jellyfish swimming in

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:17.700
the area.

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:20.860
She starts to panic when the jellyfish starts
to stick to her dive suit.

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.570
Soon, she feels the jellyfish inside her body.

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:26.950
Barnes tells her to keep moving, but the jellyfish
swarm towards her.

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:29.750
Soon the water gets inside her suit and she
drowns.

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:33.070
As Beth examines Fletcher, Norman tells her
that he was once attacked by jellyfish when

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:34.210
he was young.

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.720
He says that he's been afraid of jellyfish
since then.

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.760
Beth soon realizes that the creatures that
attacked Fletcher weren't like any jellyfish

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:40.800
she's ever seen.

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:45.160
Later on, Barnes calls Norman to ask whether
Beth is mentally stable, noting that she once

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:46.550
tried to take her own life.

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:50.340
When Norman refuses to give away any information,
Barnes castigates him for including her in

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:52.790
his report while knowing about her mental
history.

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:55.910
Barnes fears that Beth will put the entire
operation in jeopardy if she loses control

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:58.790
of her mind, but Norman assures him that she's
okay.

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:01.880
As they continue to argue, Ted interrupts
them to let them know Harry's awake.

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:06.400
In the kitchen, Barnes asks if Harry&nbsp; can
remember what happened inside the sphere.

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:10.120
Harry confirms that he went inside, despite
the lack of an opening on the object.

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:13.900
Harry compliments Norman for his cooking,
so Norman hands him a plate of calamari.

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:17.060
But as soon as he learns what it is, he starts
gasping for air.

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:20.670
Ted performs the Heimlich maneuver on him,
but he says that he's not choking.

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:22.760
He tells them that he just doesn't like squid.

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:26.060
Later, Barnes asks Ted to go to the control
room because there's something wrong with

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:27.280
the computers.

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:30.700
While Barnes tries to figure out the problem,
Harry arrives in the room and points out that

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:33.030
there's a pattern in the numbers showing on
the screen.

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:36.520
Harry tells Ted to check if it's binary and
suggests decrypting the numbers with the configuration

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.090
of the keyboard.

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:41.690
After deciphering the message, they learn
that it comes from a sender named Jerry.

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:45.280
Barnes doubts that it came from an alien because
the message seems to be infantile.

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:48.880
Harry points out that it's a perfect message
because it's concise and non-threatening.

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:52.450
When Jerry tells them that he's happy, Norman
starts to worry because he has no idea what

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:54.670
the entity will do when he gets mad.

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:58.260
When Norman starts hearing thumping outside
the ship, he asks Edmunds, another personnel

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.600
on Habitat, if she knows what it is.

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:04.270
After getting no response from Edmunds, he
reports the strange noise to Barnes.

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:07.210
Barnes tells him that Edmunds appears to be
outside the Habitat.

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:10.590
When Beth and Norman look for her, they see
her body on the side of the station and discover

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:13.010
that it was her foot banging on the Habitat
wall.

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:16.500
When Beth takes a closer look, she's startled
by the condition of her body.

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:18.990
She tells Norman that Edmunds' body has been
pulverized.

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:23.450
Meanwhile, Harry is in his room reading 20,000
Leagues Under the Sea by Jules Verne.

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:26.810
As Norman and Beth bring Edmund's body back
inside the station, eggs start to fall to

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:27.940
the ground.

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:31.080
Barnes suddenly notices something moving on
the sonar, so he tells Norman and Beth to

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:33.450
hurry because the object is moving closer.

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:37.900
When Beth and Norman reach the station, the
object suddenly disappears from the sonar.

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:41.310
Norman wants to talk to Jerry about the horrific
incident outside, but Barnes tells him that

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:42.730
they need a game plan.

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:46.290
When they get inside the control room, Jerry
asks Norman what a game plan is.

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:49.390
Norman realizes that Jerry can hear what they're
saying even when they're not in the control

00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:50.480
room.

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:54.020
When Jerry stops responding, the unknown object
appears in the sonar again.

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:56.810
They notice that more eggs are falling outside
the Habitat.

00:07:56.810 --> 00:08:00.220
When Beth asks if they have any defenses to
protect the sensor grid, Barnes notes that

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:02.590
they have a high-voltage current on the skin
of the Habitat.

00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:05.900
However, a fire breaks out every time they
turn it on.

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:09.470
The creature, which appears to be a giant
squid, starts banging against the Habitat

00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:10.590
repeatedly.

00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:13.190
Harry remains asleep in his quarter despite
the noise.

00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:16.470
When Barnes realizes that the pressure is
dropping inside the Habitat, he instructs

00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:19.170
Ted to go to the control room to set it back
to normal.

00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:24.200
As Ted turns the valve, a jolt of electricity
slams him to the wall, knocking him unconscious.

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:27.590
Norman goes to the room and turns the valve,
but the creature keeps attacking.

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:30.950
Barnes realizes that the creature won't let
go, so he instructs Norman to activate the

00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:32.470
high-voltage current.

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:35.959
After pulling the lever, the banging stops,
but a fire soon breaks out in the communications

00:08:35.959 --> 00:08:36.959
room.

00:08:36.959 --> 00:08:40.439
As they scramble to extinguish the fire, the
emergency doors get activated.

00:08:40.439 --> 00:08:43.620
Ted helps the team put out the flames as soon
as he becomes conscious.

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:46.959
Barnes jams a door with a box to prevent it
from locking him in a hallway.

00:08:46.959 --> 00:08:50.500
But when he tries to get out, the box slips,
and the door crushes him.

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:53.750
As Ted extinguishes the fire in the kitchen,
a part of the ceiling falls on his head and

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:55.480
debris pins him to the floor.

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:58.710
He tells Norman to get out as the fire starts
to build up below him.

00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:02.500
Ted then succumbs to the flames, and the fire
extinguishes itself.

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:05.779
Norman tries to contact Jerry again to ask
him who put the fire out.

00:09:05.779 --> 00:09:09.639
Jerry asks him if he liked the giant squid
and tells him that he can manifest more.

00:09:09.639 --> 00:09:12.310
Norman explains that the manifestations are
killing people.

00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:16.160
He warns the entity that he'll end up alone
again if people on the ship continue to die.

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:19.070
The entity tells Norman to stop calling him
Jerry.

00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:21.950
Norman goes to his quarters and finds Harry
reading Verne's book.

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:25.079
When Norman asks Harry if he knew about the
attack, he says he slept through it because

00:09:25.079 --> 00:09:26.320
he was tired.

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:29.980
Harry tells Norman that he loves the Jules
Verne book, but he can't get past page 87

00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:31.600
because it is too scary.

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:35.629
Norman notices that Harry is oddly calm despite
the catastrophic events within the Habitat.

00:09:35.629 --> 00:09:40.139
He informs Harry that Barnes and Ted are dead,
adding that most of their reserve gas is gone.

00:09:40.139 --> 00:09:42.899
Beth reminds them that they need to reset
the mini-sub.

00:09:42.899 --> 00:09:46.139
Norman volunteers to go and tells Beth that
he doesn't want Harry anywhere near the mini-sub

00:09:46.139 --> 00:09:49.450
because he suspects that Harry is somehow
responsible for the incidents.

00:09:49.450 --> 00:09:52.779
Beth tells Norman that he'll watch over Harry
from the control room.

00:09:52.779 --> 00:09:55.360
Norman resets the mini-sub and heads back
to the Habitat.

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:57.980
But on the way, he notices bubbles coming
out of his suit.

00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:02.190
He calls Beth for help, saying he can't breathe,
but she's not in the control room.

00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:05.649
Harry guides him and tells him he has a faulty
valve, but he'll still be able to breathe.

00:10:05.649 --> 00:10:08.649
Norman eventually reaches the ladder leading
to the Habitat, but a snake-like creature

00:10:08.649 --> 00:10:09.999
attacks him.

00:10:09.999 --> 00:10:12.829
Before long, the creature leaves him, allowing
him to get back inside.

00:10:12.829 --> 00:10:17.060
Moments later, they notice Beth going inside
the spacecraft, so they ask her what she's

00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:18.060
doing.

00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:20.860
She tells them that she went out looking for
food because they ran out.

00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:23.800
Harry tells Norman that there's plenty of
food in the kitchen.

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:27.139
Norman gets angry with Beth, scolding her
for not keeping watch on him as he was resetting

00:10:27.139 --> 00:10:28.360
the mini-sub.

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:30.649
He then points out that they still have enough
food.

00:10:30.649 --> 00:10:33.630
When she finds that the fridge and the cupboard
are filled with food, she tells them that

00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:35.310
she didn't see them earlier.

00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:38.790
As Norman continues to castigate Beth, she
asks Norman if Harry told him what happened

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:40.430
inside the sphere.

00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:43.750
When Norman asks Beth if she went inside the
sphere, she leaves the room without answering

00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:45.020
the question.

00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:47.920
Norman picks up the Jules Verne book from
the ground but notices that Harry is still

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:49.269
reading his copy.

00:10:49.269 --> 00:10:52.120
He then finds more copies of the book in the
cupboards.

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:55.250
Norman goes to the control room to ask Jerry
what's inside the sphere.

00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:57.430
The entity tells him to stop calling him Jerry.

00:10:57.430 --> 00:11:01.579
Later, Norman tries to decipher the code and
realizes that Harry made an error in decoding

00:11:01.579 --> 00:11:02.579
the numbers.

00:11:02.579 --> 00:11:06.680
Meanwhile, Beth goes outside of the Habitat
and switches on an explosive device.

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:09.970
When Norman finally decrypts the numbers,
he learns that the entity's name is Harry,

00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:10.970
not Jerry.

00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:14.279
Norman tells Beth that Jerry is Harry, and
that Harry seems to be manifesting the strange

00:11:14.279 --> 00:11:15.839
creatures around them.

00:11:15.839 --> 00:11:19.600
Norman asks her to read page 87 of the Jules
Verne book, which talks about a monster with

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:21.310
27 feet long tentacles.

00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:24.520
Norman points out that Harry hates squid,
and he got scared when he read the passage

00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:25.829
from the book.

00:11:25.829 --> 00:11:28.850
Norman believes that Harry's imaginations
manifest in the real world because he went

00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:30.439
into the sphere.

00:11:30.439 --> 00:11:34.110
Norman suggests putting Harry in a deep unconscious
sleep to keep him from manifesting any more

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:35.110
creatures.

00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:37.810
He and Beth go through the ship's medical
supplies to find a drug that would knock Harry

00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:39.190
unconscious.

00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:43.339
While Harry is lying in bed, Norman holds
him down while Beth injects him with the sedative.

00:11:43.339 --> 00:11:45.019
Harry goes to sleep right away.

00:11:45.019 --> 00:11:48.160
They soon receive a transmission from the
surface, telling them that the weather conditions

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:51.860
have returned to normal and they can return
to the surface within six hours.

00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:55.160
As Norman brushes his teeth on his flooded
bathroom, a snake suddenly slithers inside

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:56.230
his pants.

00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:58.189
Beth arrives as he screams in fear.

00:11:58.189 --> 00:12:01.269
Beth then grabs the reptile and tells him
that it was a Belcher snake.

00:12:01.269 --> 00:12:04.550
She says that it's the most poisonous snake
in the world, but they're only dangerous at

00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:05.550
night.

00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:08.470
Beth soon tells Norman to meet her at the
lab, but when he gets there, she locks him

00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:09.470
in.

00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:12.550
She instructs him to inject himself with the
sedative because he's been manifesting the

00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:13.550
snakes.

00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:16.490
Beth also points out that the jellyfish came
out of Norman's mind because it was one of

00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:17.910
his childhood fears.

00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:20.820
Beth further reminds him that he's the only
one who could be manifesting the creatures

00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:23.160
because Harry is in a dreamless sleep.

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:27.010
As Norman continually refuses her demand,
Beth takes the gas off the room.

00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:31.139
As the lab floods with water, Norman grabs
a canister of oxygen on the floor.

00:12:31.139 --> 00:12:33.779
Norman manages to open a hatch and swim out
of the Habitat.

00:12:33.779 --> 00:12:37.350
As Beth watches him on the monitors, she sees
a video of Barnes asking her what qualifies

00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:39.149
her for their secret operation.

00:12:39.149 --> 00:12:42.189
She also sees footage of Norman berating her
for almost getting him killed when he went

00:12:42.189 --> 00:12:43.620
to the mini-sub.

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:46.199
Beth gets anxious and runs out of the control
room.

00:12:46.199 --> 00:12:49.910
When Norman gets back inside, he hears Beth
crying inside a hatch, so he goes down and

00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:51.250
talks to her.

00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:53.790
Norman deduces that Beth also went into the
sphere.

00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:56.189
Harry sees them and asks them why they knocked
him out.

00:12:56.189 --> 00:12:58.940
Norman tells him that they all went into the
sphere, and everything they're thinking is

00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:00.920
manifesting into reality.

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:03.680
Norman speculates that the astronauts also
did the same.

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:07.000
He thinks the spaceship crew went in one by
one and became so paranoid that they killed

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.290
each other.

00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:11.740
They soon hear an announcement saying that
the explosives outside the Habitat have been

00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:13.879
activated, and they only 13 minutes to evacuate.

00:13:13.879 --> 00:13:17.301
Beth explains that the explosives were supposed
to be used to blow up the corals, but she

00:13:17.301 --> 00:13:19.899
used them as a defense perimeter around the
ship.

00:13:19.899 --> 00:13:22.889
She thinks that something from the sphere
has triggered it, but she soon realizes that

00:13:22.889 --> 00:13:26.279
her mind probably activated it because she
was thinking of wanting to die.

00:13:26.279 --> 00:13:29.519
Harry tells her that the explosive will disintegrate
everything because of the liquid hydrogen

00:13:29.519 --> 00:13:31.320
in the spacecraft.

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:34.480
Norman prompts them to run to the mini-sub,
but when they get inside the vehicle, they

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:35.480
couldn't turn it on.

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:38.720
They find themselves instantly transported
inside the spacecraft.

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:42.189
They try to find their way out, but they appear
to be running in circles.

00:13:42.189 --> 00:13:45.360
Realizing that they might not get out, Harry
tells them to leave him behind.

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:49.490
When they end up in front of the sphere, Norman's
reflection instructs him to push the button.

00:13:49.490 --> 00:13:51.560
Norman tells them to let go of their thoughts.

00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:54.540
When they end up in the mini-sub again, Norman
pushes the button.

00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:58.380
The mini-sub soon becomes operational and
starts moving towards the surface.

00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:01.529
Harry fears that they're moving too slow,
and they'll be sucked back down when the bomb

00:14:01.529 --> 00:14:02.529
explodes.

00:14:02.529 --> 00:14:05.930
As the mini-sub reaches the surface, explosion
destroys the Habitat.

00:14:05.930 --> 00:14:09.649
After going through the decompression process,
they discuss what they will tell the Navy.

00:14:09.649 --> 00:14:12.329
Harry points out that no one would believe
them if they admit the truth.

00:14:12.329 --> 00:14:15.439
Harry surmises that the sphere is destroyed,
but Beth points out that they still have the

00:14:15.439 --> 00:14:16.439
power.

00:14:16.439 --> 00:14:19.400
Beth worries that she might manifest weird
things in her sleep, and she fears that their

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:21.640
power would end up in the wrong hands.

00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:24.999
Norman tells her that they are the wrong hands,
noting that they've been manifesting destructive

00:14:24.999 --> 00:14:26.110
thoughts.

00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:29.129
Harry hints that they could use their power
to forget what they discovered.

00:14:29.129 --> 00:14:32.110
Norman wonders if they want to forget, knowing
that they came across the most significant

00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:33.769
discovery in history.

00:14:33.769 --> 00:14:36.259
Norman asserts that it's hard to let go of
the power when they know it can make their

00:14:36.259 --> 00:14:37.779
dreams come true.

00:14:37.779 --> 00:14:40.550
Harry tells them they're not ready for that
kind of power.

00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:43.900
Harry points out that the Navy personnel will
soon enter the room to interrogate them, so

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:46.690
they join hands and think about forgetting
about their power.

00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:50.459
As they concentrate, the sphere rises from
the bottom of the ocean and flies into the

00:14:50.459 --> 00:14:51.459
sky.

00:14:51.459 --> 00:15:00.279
When they open their eyes, Norman and Harry
are puzzled about holding each other's hands.
