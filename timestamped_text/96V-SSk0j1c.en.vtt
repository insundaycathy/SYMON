00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.720
Welcome back for another 5 minute movie recap.

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:04.800
Today, I'm going to give you an overview of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.720
2018 British-American science fiction&nbsp;
horror film called 'Annihilation'.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.320
There will be Spoilers ahead,&nbsp;
so please proceed with caution.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.160
After returning as the lone survivor of&nbsp;
an expedition to an abnormal zone known&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.040
as the 'Shimmer,' cellular biology professor and&nbsp;
Army veteran Lena is questioned in a top-secret&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:26.640
US government facility code-named Area X. The&nbsp;
Shimmer formed three years ago from a meteoroid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.800
that crashed inside a lighthouse on the southern&nbsp;
United States' coast, and it is steadily spreading&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:36.640
its limits. Kane, Lena's Green Beret spouse, was&nbsp;
a member of a previous expedition and returns at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:42.240
their house after a year, unable to explain where&nbsp;
he was or how he returned. As his health worsens,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.880
Lena summons an ambulance, but it is stopped by&nbsp;
security personnel and brought to Area X. Dr.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.280
Ventress, a government psychologist, shows&nbsp;
Lena the Shimmer while Kane is in intensive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.840
care and says that numerous exploratory teams&nbsp;
have entered, but only Kane has ever returned.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.200
Ventress is getting ready to lead a new research&nbsp;
expedition into the Shimmer, with Lena, physicist&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:07.200
Josie Radek, geomorphologist Cassie 'Cass'&nbsp;
Sheppard, and paramedic Anya Thorensen as members.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.920
When the party enters the Shimmer, Lena gets&nbsp;
a vision of a previous romance she had with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.640
a coworker, which took place before Kane's&nbsp;
disappearance. When the party awakens in their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.960
tents, they discover that their communications&nbsp;
and navigation devices have stopped working,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.720
that three to four days have passed, and that&nbsp;
they have no recollection of what happened after&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.360
they entered the Shimmer. They come across&nbsp;
mutant flora and animals, and Josie survives&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.720
an attack by an albino alligator with rows of&nbsp;
shark-like fangs. They discover a video message&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.440
from Kane's expedition at an abandoned military&nbsp;
camp, showing him doing field surgery on another&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.080
soldier's abdomen only to see his intestines&nbsp;
moving on their own. Given the way the organs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.880
are distributed, the soldier's corpse appears to&nbsp;
have evolved into an enlarged colony of lichens.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.480
A mutant bear attacks the base at night, dragging&nbsp;
Cass away, and Lena later discovers her mangled&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.960
corpse. They come discover plants that have&nbsp;
taken on human-like shapes as they arrive at an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:04.480
abandoned town. According to Josie, the Shimmer&nbsp;
acts as a prism for all kinds of information,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:08.160
including DNA, distorting and&nbsp;
changing anything inside its bounds,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.040
and the group is already starting to change.&nbsp;
After witnessing her fingerprint patterns alter,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.200
Anya becomes paranoid and ties up the&nbsp;
others, accusing Lena of murdering Cass.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.720
The bear entices Anya away by imitating Cass's&nbsp;
call for assistance, then enters the room with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.760
the ladies and threatens them. Anya, who is&nbsp;
hurt, arrives and shoots the bear, who kills&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.800
her by ripping her mouth off. Josie manages to&nbsp;
free herself and kills the bear with a shotgun.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.360
Ventress, who is dying of cancer and is&nbsp;
desperate to discover the truth about the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.480
Shimmer before she dies, sets out on her own for&nbsp;
the lighthouse. The Shimmer's 'refractions' are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.800
already within Josie and Lena's bodies;&nbsp;
Josie expresses her belief that Cass's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.120
dying consciousness was 'refracted' into the&nbsp;
bear and walks off, as her body turns into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.400
plant stuff. Lena arrives at the lighthouse to&nbsp;
find Kane's corpses and another video message,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.320
assuming he accepted the suicide expedition&nbsp;
into the Shimmer because she cheated on him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.600
Kane instructs the man filming to find Lena&nbsp;
and then kills himself with an incendiary bomb;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.440
the other man is shown to be an extraterrestrial&nbsp;
doppelgÃ¤nger who took Kane's place.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.320
Ventress says that the powers underlying the&nbsp;
Shimmer will expand to encompass all as Lena&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:19.120
sinks through the hole left by the meteor. She&nbsp;
then disintegrates into a luminous nebulous&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.280
structure that takes a drop of blood from&nbsp;
Lena's face, transforming into a humanoid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.760
creature that moves like Lena. In order to get&nbsp;
away from the creature that is mirroring her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.400
Lena throws one of her phosphorous grenades at it,&nbsp;
and it changes into an exact replica of herself.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:37.360
Lena detonates the grenade and runs away from the&nbsp;
lighthouse, but the monster does not pursue her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.080
The monster, which has been set fire by&nbsp;
the explosion, tenderly caresses Kane's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.240
charred body before crawling back into the&nbsp;
hole and burning the lighthouse's core.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.160
As the Shimmer's constructions crumble&nbsp;
and fade away, Lena stands there watching.

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.800
Lena's interrogator at the institution claims&nbsp;
that the Shimmer would have destroyed everything&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:59.440
in the end. Lena disagrees, claiming that&nbsp;
the Shimmer was genuinely attempting to build&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:04.320
something (presumably new life forms through the&nbsp;
information prism). When she takes a drink from a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.640
glass of water, the droplets on the edge of the&nbsp;
glass travel sideways and mix with one other.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.200
After the Shimmer faded, the interviewer&nbsp;
reports that Kane has physically healed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:18.560
and is once again lucid. Lena pays him a visit&nbsp;
and inquires whether he is Kane; he responds,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.120
'I don't believe so.' He inquires whether&nbsp;
she is Lena, but she remains silent.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.000
Kane wraps his arms around&nbsp;
Lena, and their eyes shimmer.
