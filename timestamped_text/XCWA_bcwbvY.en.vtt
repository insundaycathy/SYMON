00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:15.430
After defeating Owen Shaw and his crew and
securing amnesty for their past crimes, Dominic

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:21.680
"Dom" Toretto, Brian O'Conner and the rest
of their team have returned to the United

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.770
States to live peaceful, normal lives again.

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:30.750
Brian begins to accustom himself to life as
a father, while Dom tries to help Letty Ortiz

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:31.900
regain her memory.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.850
Meanwhile, Owen's older brother, Deckard,
breaks into the secure hospital in London

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:42.890
where the comatose Owen is being held, before
breaking into DSS office in Los Angeles to

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.570
extract profiles of Dom's crew.

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.530
After revealing his identity, Deckard engages
Luke Hobbs in a fight and escapes when he

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.450
detonates a bomb that severely injures Hobbs.

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:58.470
Dom later learns from his sister Mia Toretto that
she is pregnant again and convinces her to

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:59.470
tell Brian.

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:05.950
However, a letter bomb, sent from Tokyo, explodes
and destroys the Toretto house just seconds

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:11.440
after Han, a member of Dom's team, is apparently
killed by Deckard in Tokyo.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.640
Dom travels to Tokyo to reclaim Han's body
and acquires personal items found at Han's

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.900
crash site from Han's friend, Sean Boswell.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:27.720
As Dom, Brian, Tej Parker, and Roman Pearce
mourn Han and Gisele Yasharâ€™s deaths at

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:34.000
Han's funeral in Los Angeles, Dom (in a 1970
Plymouth Road Runner) confronts Deckard (in

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.590
a 2014 Maserati Ghibli) in an underground
tunnel.

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.060
Deckard flees when a covert ops team arrives
and opens fire, led by a man only known as

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.060
Mr. Nobody.

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.790
At his air base of operations in San Diego,
Mr. Nobody says that he will help Dom in stopping

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:55.290
Deckard if he helps him get God's Eye, a computer
program that uses digital devices to track

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.022
down a person. Mr Nobody also wants Dom to help save God's Eyes, creator,

00:01:59.022 --> 00:02:04.860
a hacker named Ramsey, from a Nigerian terrorist named Mose Jakande.

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:12.120
Dom, Brian, Letty, Roman, and Tej airdrop
their off-road modified cars over the Caucasus

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:18.739
Mountains in Azerbaijan, ambush Jakande's
convoy and rescue Ramsey, and they go to Abu

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:23.510
Dhabi and steal the flash drive containing
the God's Eye chip from a billionaire hidden

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.170
in a Lykan HyperSport.

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:31.650
With God's Eye near telecommunications repeaters,
Dom, Brian, Mr. Nobody, and his team track down

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.950
and capture Deckard, but are ambushed by Jakande
and his henchmen and forced to flee while

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.769
Jakande obtains God's Eye, as the injured
Mr. Nobody calls for medical attention.

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:46.400
The team returns to Los Angeles where Dom
plans to singlehandedly fight Deckard alone,

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:52.319
while Letty, Brian, Tej, and Roman resolve
to protect Ramsey from Jakande.

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:57.129
Later on, Brian promises Mia that he will
fully dedicate himself to their family after

00:02:57.129 --> 00:02:59.189
he defeats Deckard and Jakande.

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:05.455
As Jakande pursues Brian and the rest of the team, with a stealth helicopter and an aerial drone,

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:07.810
Ramsey attempts to hack into God's Eye.

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:13.280
Hobbs, discovering the situation, leaves the
hospital and destroys the drone with an ambulance.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.209
Brian battles and kills Jakande's henchman
before hijacking a signal repeater tower,

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:22.120
allowing Ramsey to regain control of God's
Eye and shut it down.

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:29.859
Meanwhile, Dom (in his 1970 Dodge Charger)
and Deckard (in a 2005 Aston Martin DB9) engage

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:32.969
in a one-on-one brawl on top of a public parking
garage.

00:03:32.969 --> 00:03:38.239
Jakande soon intervenes and attacks them both;
Dom uses the distraction to defeat Deckard

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:41.629
by causing part of the parking garage to collapse
beneath him.

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:46.219
Dom then attempts to crash his Charger onto
Jakande's helicopter; he leaves a bag of grenades

00:03:46.219 --> 00:03:49.709
on the helicopter and crashes on the rubble
of the garage.

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:54.469
Hobbs then shoots the grenades, destroying
the helicopter and killing Jakande.

00:03:54.469 --> 00:03:59.469
After Brian and Hobbs help Letty bring out
Dom's unconscious body, she cradles him and

00:03:59.469 --> 00:04:03.219
fully regains all her memories by remembering
their wedding.

00:04:03.219 --> 00:04:06.439
Dom eventually regains consciousness after
Letty tells him this.

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:13.182
Deckard is taken into custody by Hobbs and locked away in a secret, high-security CIA prison.

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:15.749
The rest of the team relaxes on a tropical
beach.

00:04:15.749 --> 00:04:22.870
Brian and Mia play with their son Jack while
Dom, Letty, Roman, Tej, and Ramsey look on,

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:26.180
acknowledging that Brian is happily retired
with his family.

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:33.340
Dom (in a 1968 Dodge Charger) and Brian (in
a 1995 Toyota Supra) drive away and Dom remembers

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.120
all the times that he had with Brian.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:40.220
They bid each other farewell by giving one
last smile and drive off in separate directions.
