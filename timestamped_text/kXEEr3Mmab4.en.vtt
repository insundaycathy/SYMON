00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.040
Welcome to Slash Forward. Imagine witnessing a&nbsp;
celestial object touching down not too far from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.920
your house. In the subsequent days you come to the&nbsp;
unfortunate realization that your parents are no&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.800
longer your parents, whether they’ve been replaced&nbsp;
or just taken over by some other entity. In your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.520
zeal to return to some semblance of normalcy, you&nbsp;
attempt to uncover the cause of and solution to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.480
your problems. Except, your options and resources&nbsp;
are severely limited and no one believes you,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.040
because you’re just a dumb kid. What would you&nbsp;
do if you found yourself in such a situation,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.040
and how would you go about conquering&nbsp;
the unknown? We’ll be examining this and,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.280
in so doing, uncover a variety of helpful&nbsp;
rules and strategies that would serve you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.480
well in a variety of alien invasion scenarios&nbsp;
by unpacking the events that unfold and mistakes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.040
made in Tobe Hooper’s 1986 film Invaders&nbsp;
From Mars. Be sure to leave a comment to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.360
share your own strategies for saving your home&nbsp;
town, while either including or excluding the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.680
synchronous/concordant survival of your parents,&nbsp;
depending on your preference. Let’s get to it.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.080
We open on George Gardner, taking in the&nbsp;
majesty of the universe with his son David.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.880
As a NASA employee, he’s so enamored with the&nbsp;
poetry of the spheres that he demonstrates a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.560
reckless disregard for his cardigan.&nbsp;
Ellen comes out to announce bedtime,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.800
which is undermined by George, but they&nbsp;
otherwise have a good thing going here.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.120
As they complete their evening rituals and&nbsp;
settle into bed, George gives David a fresh,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.400
new penny for his collection -&nbsp;
an astronomer and a penny nerd?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.960
This dude reeks of unquenchable sexual&nbsp;
energy, my friends. Then it’s off to bed.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.520
The meteors calm down, but then the storms roll&nbsp;
in. As David goes to shut his window, he bears&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.480
witness to a gigantic, strobing meteor touching&nbsp;
down nearby, which sends him off screaming.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.080
Unfortunately, by the time they return to&nbsp;
his room, it’s descended below the crest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.480
of Copper Hill, so they disregard his concerns&nbsp;
and agree to take a look in the morning instead.

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.800
The evening’s excitement has dissipated by&nbsp;
the morning. However, David does begin to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.600
wonder about his father’s unusually dazed&nbsp;
and confused demeanor. But George has a way&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.440
of really putting you at ease. Like&nbsp;
the way he refuses to address the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.520
newly developed navel on his neck, and&nbsp;
how he’s taken to lacing his coffee with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.240
crystal meth before guzzling the piping&nbsp;
hot brew like an absolute mad lad. Then,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.880
when walking his boy to the bus, George does&nbsp;
confirm that he found something interesting on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.280
the other side of the hill when he went to&nbsp;
check, but David decides he’s good for now.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.520
At school, while the children prepare to&nbsp;
murder Mrs. McKeltch’s fresh marshland victims,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.240
David gets into a frog-tossing competition.&nbsp;
As one would expect, it ends in bloodshed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:39.360
requiring David to be escorted to the school&nbsp;
nurse. McKeltch drags him in, hoping for some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:45.200
reciprocal hen-pecking, but storms off in the face&nbsp;
of Miss Magnussen’s calm, compassionate demeanor.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.080
After school, David returns home to find the house&nbsp;
open due to a malfunction with the automatic door.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.320
With everything quiet, he naturally starts&nbsp;
watching a matinee showing of Lifeforce,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.840
but his prankster mom interrupts him&nbsp;
before he can get to the naked parts.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.480
He confides that dad had been acting like a&nbsp;
fairly odd bird that day, but they don’t both&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.640
begin to worry until he fails to show up that&nbsp;
evening. Ellen ends up calling the police who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.440
decide to go check out Copper Hill to see if maybe&nbsp;
he’s out smoking a joint with the high schoolers.

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.840
But right after they leave,&nbsp;
George pops out with Ed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:19.280
his equally strange bro from work.&nbsp;
They hit happy hour hard as hell,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.800
so Ed staggers off toward home sans vehicle. Then&nbsp;
the police return and they all monotonally comment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:30.160
on David’s abundant imagination as regards the&nbsp;
prior’s evening’s celestial phenomenon. It’s not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.880
until after dinner that Ellen takes notice of&nbsp;
George’s strange behavior. Then, in the night,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.280
he comes in to steal David’s penny collection&nbsp;
while he pretends to be asleep. Later, the two&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.400
lovers stroll off into the mist, and David laments&nbsp;
what he recognizes to be the loss of his mother.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.880
He gets confirmation of this the next morning when&nbsp;
Ellen pulls a little skin flap off her neck, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:54.320
has suddenly lost all her bacon skills. She takes&nbsp;
his reluctance as a sign he needs some fresh air,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:58.240
and suggests they all have a little picnic&nbsp;
over the hill in the sand pit. David seems&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:04.560
to be struggling with the implications while&nbsp;
Ellen whips up a batch of her patented salted&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.440
beef patties for breakfast. They then offer&nbsp;
a strange goodbye as he heads out to the bus.

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.200
At lunch that day, he catches a private&nbsp;
conversation about some sort of destruction&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:18.000
scheduled for midnight, and that old daddy George&nbsp;
has been delegated to participate. He then peeps&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.560
on McKeltch for more juicy deets, picking up&nbsp;
on the fact that she’s sporting a fresh neck&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:27.360
bandage. Thirsty for news, he ventures into her&nbsp;
inner sanctum where he catches her feasting on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:33.760
the class project. She tries to catch him, but her&nbsp;
bloated(swollen) belly is replete with frog meat.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:38.320
He manages to find a sympathetic ear in Linda.&nbsp;
She attempts to build a rapport, but he insists&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:44.480
on inspecting her neck first. He finds it supple,&nbsp;
firm and unmarred, so he unpacks the story of what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:50.160
led him to her office that day. When he finishes,&nbsp;
she giggles - confirming adults cannot be trusted.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.840
But Linda attempts to leverage her nursing&nbsp;
authority to try to get a look at McKeltch’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:58.720
neck wound, and her responses are both&nbsp;
evasive and more aggressive than typical,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.520
causing some concern. She’s shaken enough to send&nbsp;
David out the window with a key to her house where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:08.000
she plans to meet him after school. After he&nbsp;
leaves, Linda brushes off Heather, who has come&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.400
looking for David and is sporting a similar&nbsp;
neck bandage, all but confirming his story.

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.080
David attempts an escape, but is soon&nbsp;
pinned down from all sides. Luckily,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:21.520
there is an innocent van nearby with an open door.&nbsp;
Unluckily, it belongs to McKeltch and is occupied&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:26.720
by her collection of wayward animals. She drives&nbsp;
until arriving at a trailhead where she stops for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:31.440
a vigorous afternoon hike. David follows her in&nbsp;
the hope that it will lead him to some intel. But,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:36.240
the trail leads into a series of tunnels with&nbsp;
limited cover so he’s running a big risk here.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:40.240
Regardless, he pursues her into the&nbsp;
steamy, inner sanctum. And it pays off,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.520
because he peeps the master brain, which&nbsp;
communicates through a little dangly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.280
bit that pops out of the victims’ neck&nbsp;
holes. McKeltch does a quick vowel check&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.400
before acknowledging David’s&nbsp;
presence. Fortunately,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.360
the Martians were not ready&nbsp;
for the agility of youth.

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:01.840
He runs out of there and heads straight to Linda’s&nbsp;
house where they both lay low until danger passes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:05.840
When the coast is clear, he leads her back to&nbsp;
the tunnel, which is now missing. They must’ve&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:10.640
packed up and moved, just in case a young boy&nbsp;
were to return with the school nurse. With the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:15.600
consequences of stealing away with a young boy&nbsp;
now weighing on her, she begins to succumb to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:19.840
her doubts. But before she can return him to&nbsp;
his home, they witness Mr. Gardner directing a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:24.640
couple of fresh victims over the hill, providing&nbsp;
them the chance to see how the sausage gets made.

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:29.200
Now they’re fully committed, so Linda heads into&nbsp;
town and stops at the first payphone to ring the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:34.160
state police. But before she can, Mrs. McKeltch&nbsp;
rolls up in her bus and starts grabbing at David.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:38.640
Linda scoops him up and diverts now to her&nbsp;
new plan, which is to call the FBI...from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:43.360
the school. But they drive all the way out there&nbsp;
only to discover that the phone lines are dead,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:44.640
and then the police roll up.

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:48.800
Now it’s David’s turn to come up with something,&nbsp;
and he leads Linda to his favorite hiding spot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:53.040
when he wants to get away from it all - the boiler&nbsp;
room. The police eventually make it back to where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:58.640
they are so David gives her a shhhhhhh...quiet&nbsp;
bitch. But they do get found, because they weren’t&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:03.040
really hiding. The officers weren’t expecting&nbsp;
it to be this easy, so they get overexcited and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:07.120
fail to get their shots off before the ground&nbsp;
erupts with an intergalactic strobe light.

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:10.720
On the way out, Linda wants to flee the&nbsp;
whole town, but David is still encumbered&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:15.120
by a nostalgic attachment to his parents. So&nbsp;
his next movie is to head to the military base&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:18.720
where his dad works to get a meeting&nbsp;
with General Wilson. As it turns out,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:23.520
being George Gardner’s son has some benefits&nbsp;
as they’re soon welcomed deep into the bosom&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:27.600
of the encampment. After a couple of quick&nbsp;
neck checks, they get to spilling the beans.

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:32.800
As they do so, George arrives with a bomb and the&nbsp;
aliens’ plan, whatever that may be, is initiated.

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:35.520
When we circle back, we find&nbsp;
the general incredulous,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:40.080
but there were strange phenomena in the sky&nbsp;
the prior night, beyond the expected meteor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:40.880
shower. Their radars were just unable to track&nbsp;
it so they wrote it off as an anomaly. Being a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:44.560
man of measured action, the general needs&nbsp;
to think this over, so he sends them off&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:48.640
to the briefing room while he initiates a&nbsp;
routine security check on the NASA boys.

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:53.520
But at the mere mention of Copper Hill, they&nbsp;
draw down on him. Luckily, his right hand is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:58.320
always ready, and he doesn’t hesitate to put&nbsp;
some ninjitsu on their bodies. Before they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:02.320
can reveal anything of the Martian plan, their&nbsp;
overlord hits the self-destruct button on them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:06.400
In light of this new information, the general&nbsp;
then calls for a complete lockdown of the base.

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:10.000
Meanwhile, the truck is making its way&nbsp;
toward the launchpad, and completely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.640
disregards the freeze order. The military and&nbsp;
NASA scientists then watch in horror as the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:19.280
plan comes to fruition - keep the primates&nbsp;
from poking around on the surface of Mars.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:22.880
Now looking to counterstrike, security&nbsp;
starts popping off and the General sends&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:27.280
troops to the school while requesting David&nbsp;
lead another group toward the tunnel openings.

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:31.200
Soon soldiers are swarming like&nbsp;
ants, pouring in all over the place,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:35.360
knocking down fences and descending into&nbsp;
various tunnels and holes they happen to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:40.000
find in the area. David thinks of his parents&nbsp;
and broaches the topic of diplomacy. But,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.600
they’ve already reached into the toolbag&nbsp;
and selected a hammer, so it’s time for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:48.640
the boys to step aside and let the men do&nbsp;
their work - frolicking around in the sand.

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:53.120
While underground, a couple of sentinels emerge&nbsp;
and it’s just too much for Dr. Weinstein. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:57.360
attempts to make contact and presumes they’ve&nbsp;
reached some level of understanding. But he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:02.400
must’ve missed a couple contextual clues, because&nbsp;
they then vaporize his ass. On the plus side,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:06.800
the soldiers do confirm the Martians are&nbsp;
susceptible to gunfire and explosion.

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:10.960
Topside, David has made the determination that&nbsp;
if he wants a chance at extracting his parents,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:16.320
he has no real choice other than to go in the one&nbsp;
way they know is possible, and he goes for it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:20.800
This prompts the men to attempt to blast their way&nbsp;
in, winching themselves out of the twirling mass,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:26.160
but leaving behind an explosive payload. This&nbsp;
provides a gaping hole the men may enter.

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:30.960
Meanwhile, apparently unaware of the excitement&nbsp;
above, David watches in horror as a soldier&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:35.840
resting his head on a silicone ball sack has his&nbsp;
control module inserted. David is then brought&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:40.000
before the supreme intelligence, who he tries to&nbsp;
reason with in order to secure the return of his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.280
loved ones. But these visitors from the heavens&nbsp;
are unconcerned with the petty, human concept of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:49.920
personal relationships. With his anger boiling&nbsp;
over, David penny sacks McKeltch straight into a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:54.880
Martian’s mouth, who decides not to overlook its&nbsp;
gifted meal as David runs back for the tunnels.

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:58.800
David runs across a couple of guards, and&nbsp;
observes how they prep their vaporizers.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:02.800
They then cross paths with the gun boys who&nbsp;
take them out. David leads them back to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:08.000
needle machine where it’s open season on killing&nbsp;
Martians - who mostly stand around and take it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.200
making for a quick victory. After&nbsp;
saving Linda from penetration,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:15.200
they set some explosive charges and attempt to&nbsp;
get out of there before the ship takes off. They&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:19.840
find the way to be blocked, but David has the&nbsp;
idea to use the alien tech to regape the hole.

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:24.080
Remembering that he learned it’s fueled by copper,&nbsp;
we get a callback to David’s rare penny from the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:29.280
beginning of the movie - and he uses his greasy&nbsp;
little fingers to greedily cram it into the slot.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:32.720
As they filter out, he is distracted&nbsp;
by the reappearance of his parents,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:36.640
who try to convince him that hanging&nbsp;
out in tunnels is the cool thing to do.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:39.920
In a turn of good fortune, him&nbsp;
running from them also leads them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:44.640
out of the blast radius. The explosion of the&nbsp;
ship then also deactivates their neck needles.

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:47.680
But David wakes up suddenly, confused and scared.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:52.560
After a quick confirmation that he’s in the&nbsp;
real world, they get him calm and back in bed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:57.840
But then, like a true hustler, ya&nbsp;
boi turns his dreams into reality.&nbsp;

00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:02.320
How delightfully nostalgic that was - a&nbsp;
Golun-Globus produced Tobe Hooper film.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:06.400
It can barely get more 80s than that. As we look&nbsp;
through the lessons learned here, we’re going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:11.200
be walking away with a lot of general lessons that&nbsp;
will be useful in everyday life. Because here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:16.000
we’re mainly looking at a problem of persuasion.&nbsp;
We all know that a simple grade-schooler would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:21.040
be unable to handle a Martian horde on his own.&nbsp;
Success is really dependent on his ability to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:26.080
unlock his still-burgeoning charisma to bring&nbsp;
people on board with him. It’s less about brute&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:30.720
force and figuring how to kill aliens, and more&nbsp;
about convincing others that there is a problem&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:35.840
to address and how to curry favor and marshal the&nbsp;
forces in order to save all that they hold dear.

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:40.640
The first step here is recognition. He saw&nbsp;
something unusual in the night sky, but gets no&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:45.520
confirmation of what it was. George just agrees to&nbsp;
take a look in the morning. When David comes down,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:49.920
there is evidence that George had already been&nbsp;
there. He doesn’t mention it specifically until&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:54.000
later, but he is missing one of his loafers,&nbsp;
implying that he lost the other in a muddy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.320
hike over the hill. This should be a moment&nbsp;
of peak curiosity and information gathering.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:03.280
Why not casually inquire about their plan for&nbsp;
checking out the earthbound meteor? In the course&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:07.600
of this questioning it may become more apparently&nbsp;
obvious that something is wrong with your dad.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:12.560
With only minimal conversation, there were clear&nbsp;
indicators and he was obviously having a hard time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:16.640
keeping it together. Pressing the conversation&nbsp;
and forcing him into more interaction would go&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:21.680
a long way in confirming any suspicions. The main&nbsp;
thing to take away from this is to always be wary&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:27.440
of a dad with an inconsistent routine. George has&nbsp;
likely been wearing the same clothes, telling the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:32.480
same jokes and engaging in the same morning&nbsp;
ritual for at least the last ten years. Any&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:36.960
sudden change alone is cause for suspicion, but&nbsp;
the apathy toward the loss of his leather house&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:42.480
shoe and clear indication of unspecified physical&nbsp;
trauma should be raising significant alarms.

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:46.800
This is confirmed later when a clear break in his&nbsp;
schedule was worrisome enough to prompt Ellen to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:51.600
call the police. The police are already fairly&nbsp;
strange on their own, but when they come back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:55.440
holding their necks, we now have a second&nbsp;
indicator that is stronger than the first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:59.600
in that it goes beyond simple behavioral&nbsp;
observation. With George, there was a break&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:04.240
in routine, but what of the other town weirdos?&nbsp;
You would have to develop some sort of method&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:08.880
to gauge strangeness, which would rely too&nbsp;
heavily on subjective measures. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:14.160
with this new objective physical indicator you’re&nbsp;
in business. The business of inspecting necks.

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:18.160
Of course, in order for this to be meaningful, you&nbsp;
would have to have the mental grit to push through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:23.360
the coping stages to reach Acceptance as quickly&nbsp;
as possible. David’s inability to do this, despite&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:28.320
the abundance of evidence early on, resulted in&nbsp;
him losing his mother to the horde. The primary&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:32.960
negative impact of this is the fact that he does&nbsp;
not appear to have any other trustworthy adults in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:38.320
his social circle. So now, he has the disadvantage&nbsp;
of trying to figure out who he can confide in.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:42.880
As a child approaching adults, this can be very&nbsp;
intimidating and presents a high likelihood of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:47.120
failure since you will be starting from a negative&nbsp;
position as, aside from the risk of choosing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:52.160
the wrong one to approach, most adults would be&nbsp;
unlikely to take you seriously in the first place.

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:56.960
However, this could be turned to your advantage.&nbsp;
As you begin to gather intel and try to ascertain&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:56.960 --> 00:14:01.680
exactly what the threat is, you may find yourself&nbsp;
with greater opportunities to enter areas that may&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:06.720
be off limits to others by presenting yourself as&nbsp;
an unassuming child. This is an important step,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:11.200
because the more specifics you have, the more&nbsp;
believable your story will be when others hear it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:15.520
The key characteristic here is to get to the point&nbsp;
where you know and accept that something is wrong,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:20.240
but pretend like it’s all good. Feigning&nbsp;
ignorance, or playing stupid, is a strong&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:25.200
strategy. Properly employed, it will allow you&nbsp;
to overstep and risk mistakes while minimizing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:30.240
negative outcomes as your actions will likely&nbsp;
be interpreted as an innocent misunderstanding.

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:35.200
However, this does require you not to plunge too&nbsp;
deep. When David pursues McKeltch, he follows&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:39.440
her into her closet. Instead of observing from&nbsp;
the doorway where he can slip away or play off&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:44.240
his presence as just seeking to ask her a quick&nbsp;
question, he ventures well into the closet with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:49.760
no cover. Once she turns around, he’s toast. So,&nbsp;
unless he intended to physically confront her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:54.080
there is no reason for him to delve this&nbsp;
far. After he is sighted, his cover is now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:59.360
blown. Everything from this point must be full&nbsp;
espionage. He’s lost both the element of surprise,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:03.760
and his ability to wander about appearing&nbsp;
as a babe in the woods, so to speak.

00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:08.880
Now finding an ally is of the utmost importance.&nbsp;
David happening upon Linda, and the path they took&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:14.160
toward solidarity was, ultimately, a sequence of&nbsp;
circumstances that unfolded through sheer luck.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:18.640
Ideally, you would have some familiarity with the&nbsp;
person you approach first. I would’ve liked for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:22.880
David to have carved out a little time beforehand&nbsp;
to explore what was on the other side of Copper&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:27.360
Hill. Ultimately it turned out there was nothing&nbsp;
to see other than a sand pit, so that may not have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:31.760
helped him, but he didn’t know that at the time.&nbsp;
If you’re thinking ahead and taking steps toward&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:36.560
achieving your goal, you should really be focused&nbsp;
on finding a way to shine a light on the dangers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:39.920
you’ve identified. Whoever you approach is going&nbsp;
to have to swallow a humdinger of a story (pill&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:44.400
that could choke a horse). Your best approach&nbsp;
is to find some innocuous way to get them to a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:47.920
point where they see what you’ve seen so&nbsp;
they have no choice but to believe you.

00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:50.720
In this case, he lucked into the&nbsp;
neck bandage thing. But if there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:54.000
hadn’t been more than one of them, this&nbsp;
would be a meaningless detail. Then,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.760
the tunnel entrance disappearing was&nbsp;
another huge miss. Everything was on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:01.920
the verge of falling apart until they happened&nbsp;
to bear witness to an actual abduction. This&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:06.240
was a huge turning point that almost didn’t&nbsp;
happen due to David’s lack of preparation.

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:09.840
In regards to his actual intel&nbsp;
gathering, this was also high risk&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:14.720
and sloppy. The smooth tunnels provided no&nbsp;
cover or places to hide. He basically had&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:18.400
to stand out in the open the entire&nbsp;
time. But, in terms of actual intel,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:23.360
the trip was entirely wasted. He learned that&nbsp;
the Martians are very vascular, but slow,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:28.480
which is good to know. The leader of the group&nbsp;
is a giant, squishy brain, which would be very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:33.440
susceptible to physical damage. However, it speaks&nbsp;
in a Martian language that he can’t understand,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:39.680
and then he doesn’t actually relay any of the&nbsp;
other information to anyone else throughout the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:43.840
movie. After all the time and effort that goes&nbsp;
into finding and confiding in an accomplice,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:47.760
you have to then also bring them into the&nbsp;
loop. Everyone should be working off of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:52.240
same information, just in case the group gets&nbsp;
split up or some other hardship befalls you.

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:56.320
At this point, the best option is likely to get&nbsp;
out of town entirely so you can get a broader&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:56.320 --> 00:17:00.800
perspective on what’s going on and possible next&nbsp;
steps. Instead of doing this, David wants to try&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:05.040
to find his mom and dad, which should be a&nbsp;
huge mistake. You have to deal with the core&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:09.840
problem before moving on to secondary issues.&nbsp;
Especially when the core problem involves your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:15.600
parents’ brains being completely overrun. This&nbsp;
happens to work out in their favor, yet again,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:20.560
because George works for NASA at a base that&nbsp;
is independently secured by Marine forces.

00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:24.000
He was able to bring them on his side&nbsp;
quickly when the pod folks basically&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.880
showed their whole asses right in front of the&nbsp;
General just before a full display of their power&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:34.000
and intent went off right in their faces. This&nbsp;
is highly situational and lucky on their part.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.000
Again, not knowing who has been taken over,&nbsp;
but knowing the police have been infiltrated,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.637
you would be better off moving out of town to&nbsp;
find help. Of course, you would still be tasked&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:40.637 --> 00:17:43.760
with convincing them of the problem. It may be of&nbsp;
benefit to grab you one of those schoolchildren&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:47.360
to take along as evidence in case you have&nbsp;
trouble convincing outsiders of your plight.

00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:50.560
Once you have returned in force,&nbsp;
there was a question of negotiation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:55.760
vs aggression. It’s understandable that David&nbsp;
was concerned for the well being of his parents,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:58.800
but the Martians had shown&nbsp;
nothing but aggression so far.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:03.200
This is further confirmed by Weinstein’s fate&nbsp;
in the tunnels. There is clearly no interest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:07.440
in communication. Although, in fairness,&nbsp;
he was talking to a couple of grunts.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:10.720
They are not the decision makers. But&nbsp;
what are the odds of getting a meeting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:14.800
with the supreme intelligence if every other&nbsp;
Martian you run across tries to vaporize you?

00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:19.120
No, this was basically the correct strat - they&nbsp;
went in hard and got the job done in the end.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:23.600
The only real criticism I would have here is that&nbsp;
they pulled back too soon. I’m not sure why the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:28.400
primary objective was to detonate the entire&nbsp;
ship, as it was likely full of useful alien&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:33.360
technology - imagine if we had gotten smart phones&nbsp;
ten years earlier where we’d be now. They should&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:37.680
have stuck to the guns and not let up as easily&nbsp;
as they did. Any veteran Contra player knows that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:43.120
this is only the master brain’s first phase. There&nbsp;
will likely be one to three more phases after&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:47.840
this. If you have sufficient ammo and patience,&nbsp;
you’ll eventually make your way through them all,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:52.160
eliminating the threat and retaining all&nbsp;
the precious technology for yourself.

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:55.040
Finally, there’s the question of&nbsp;
whether any of this matters at all,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:59.520
since David ultimately woke up, revealing this&nbsp;
to be a dream. To that, I would have to say&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:04.880
this obviously matters. The dream was a dry run.&nbsp;
When he woke up the loop initiated in real life.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:09.600
So if he had been introspective about his faults&nbsp;
he was presented a chance to correct everything.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:13.840
Given the state of the news recently, I find&nbsp;
it hard to imagine that anyone would dismiss&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:18.960
the importance of this type of exercise.&nbsp;
You are free to do so at your own peril.

00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:23.840
Before we go, I’d like to give a huge thanks to&nbsp;
my donors, memorialized in the hall of headshots.

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:38.560
I have a website set up where you can&nbsp;
