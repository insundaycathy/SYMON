the movie warning heavy spoilers ahead day 89&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:58.640
amid the many tattered missing persons posters and&nbsp;
flyers a family quietly tiptoes barefoot through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:04.560
an empty store of a ghost town the family's mother&nbsp;
evelyn abbott carefully looks through a cluster of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:10.720
uncollected prescription bottles for her eldest&nbsp;
son marcus who is sick evelyn gives marcus a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.680
medication and uses sign language to reassure&nbsp;
her deaf daughter regan that her brother is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:22.160
okay regan then checks on her younger brother beau&nbsp;
who is drawing a picture of a rocket on the floor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:28.800
he signs to regain rocket that's how we'll get&nbsp;
away then beau climbs the mostly empty shelves&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:34.320
and reaches for a space shuttle toy the toy&nbsp;
falls from the shelf but regan scrambles to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:40.000
catch it before it hits the floor meanwhile&nbsp;
the family's father lee abbott has scavenged&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.360
some electronics for a radio which will boost its&nbsp;
signal as well as some cutting pliers for regan&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:51.360
evelyn signs to her family that it'll be dark soon&nbsp;
and they prepare to leave but the family looks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:57.520
of horror come across their faces as because spo&nbsp;
has the electronic space shuttle toy in his hands&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:03.600
on which lee carefully takes from him and removes&nbsp;
its two batteries he signs to his youngest son&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.600
it's too loud as the family departs regan sneaks&nbsp;
the toy back to beau who then grabs the batteries&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:15.680
on his way out the abbott silently walk back home&nbsp;
on a trail of sand they've created as they come to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.560
a walking bridge they suddenly hear the electronic&nbsp;
sound of the space shuttle toy from beau who is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:26.000
pulling up the behind the rear a horrifiedly&nbsp;
races back toward his son but it's too late&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:34.480
an alien creature quickly seizes and kills beau&nbsp;
day 472 the abbots are home on their family farm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.200
lee is in the basement of the farmhouse where&nbsp;
he has set up an extensive surveillance system&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.240
of cameras and monitors there are also scores&nbsp;
of various news clippings which report of an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:50.480
alien invasion as well as notes from leave it&nbsp;
red blind attack sound and armor lee went to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.520
his radio and electronics which he uses in&nbsp;
the hope of contacting any other survivors&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:02.400
evelyn meanwhile is in a cellar where she hangs&nbsp;
a toy she has crafted evelyn is pregnant lee has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.680
moved up to the top of his grain silo where&nbsp;
he looks through pictures of beau evelyn&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:13.840
sets up an oxygen tank which is connected to an&nbsp;
infant breathing mask it sits next to a covered&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:19.040
soundproof baby [ __ ] evelyn asks regan to&nbsp;
tell her father that dinner is ready which she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:25.040
reluctantly does they eat quiet foods on leaves of&nbsp;
lettuce instead of plates and do a silent prayer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.560
afterwards regan and marcus play monopoly&nbsp;
when he accidentally knocks over a lantern&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:36.240
which sets the rug on fire lee quickly puts it&nbsp;
out and they quietly wait for the consequences&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:41.760
it seems as though they've dodged a bullet but&nbsp;
then hear a loud noise on the roof lee looks out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:47.360
the window and is startled but relieved to see a&nbsp;
raccoon fall from the roof he heads down into the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:53.280
basement to work on a cochlear implant processor&nbsp;
which will help his daughter to hear evelyn comes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.640
down where they share a smile and a set of earbuds&nbsp;
as they slow dance to neil young's harvest moon&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:05.840
day 473 while lee is pouring down more sand&nbsp;
on their walking paths evelyn is in the cellar&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:12.000
checking her blood pressure her due date is just&nbsp;
a couple weeks away she places a steethoscope to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.840
her abdomen revealing a strong healthy heartbeat&nbsp;
regan enters the house being careful to walk only&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:23.200
on the marked parts of the floor which don't creak&nbsp;
and wants to go down into the basement but her dad&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:29.440
stops her he has added small amplifiers from a&nbsp;
stereo to her new cochlear implant processor and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:36.000
wants to put them on regan but she stops him and&nbsp;
signs that they never work lee disheartened hands&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.840
them to her instead and starts to set out on an&nbsp;
excursion he wants marcus to come with him but the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:48.720
boy is scared and doesn't want to go instead it's&nbsp;
regan who wants to go but lee tells her to stay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:54.640
and take care of her mom she runs to her room&nbsp;
and tries on the new cochlear implant processor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:59.920
when they don't work she's devastated regan&nbsp;
packs a bag which includes a wrapped object&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:05.520
from her dresser and her cutting pliers then&nbsp;
she leaves the farm lee has taken his son to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:11.360
the river where he teaches him that making small&nbsp;
sounds is okay as long as ladder sounds are nearby&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:17.600
next to a waterfall they can speak freely to each&nbsp;
other without fear of being heard marcus asks his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:22.960
dad why he didn't let regan come and if he blames&nbsp;
her for what happened to beau because she blames&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:30.000
herself when lee says it was no one's fault marcus&nbsp;
tells him if he still loves her he should tell her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.040
during this conversation regan has arrived at&nbsp;
the walking bridge where a makeshift memorial&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:40.240
has been constructed for beau she unwraps&nbsp;
the object from her dresser which we discover&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:45.840
is the space shuttle toy then uses the pliers&nbsp;
to cut a wire which enables the toy to light up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:51.680
without making any noise back at home evelyn is&nbsp;
carrying a laundry bag up from the basement when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:57.280
it gets snagged on the stairs she manages to&nbsp;
pull it loose causing her to fall and exposing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:03.040
the point of a nail sticking up from the stair on&nbsp;
the way back home lee and marcus are startled by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:08.880
an old man coming out of the woods and then notice&nbsp;
the dead body of his wife on the ground nearby lee&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:15.440
implores the old man to stay silent but instead he&nbsp;
lets out a primal scream lee grabs marcus and runs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:22.000
as the man is quickly scooped up and killed by an&nbsp;
alien back home evelyn's water breaks she heads&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.840
down to the basement and impales her foot on the&nbsp;
exposed nail coming up from the stair she manages&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:32.960
not to scream out but drops the picture frame she&nbsp;
was holding which draws an alien into the house&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:38.880
evelyn pulls her foot off the nail switches on the&nbsp;
red light bulbs which run across the property and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:44.880
serve as a warning signal and searches the shelves&nbsp;
for a mechanical kitchen timer the alien slowly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:50.720
walks down the stairs into the basement listening&nbsp;
for any evidence of life when the timer goes off&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:57.360
the alien attacks it as evelyn runs upstairs she&nbsp;
sees another alien in the front yard evelyn goes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:02.880
upstairs into the bathroom and sinks into the tub&nbsp;
she's starting to give birth as the alien comes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:09.520
upstairs lee has returned home and is horrified&nbsp;
to see that the red lights have been switched on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:16.240
he signs the word rocket to his son then tells him&nbsp;
i need you to make a sound louder you can do it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:22.720
as marcus sprints to a designated area and lights&nbsp;
a fuse which sets off a series of fireworks lee&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:29.120
then grabs his shotgun then lee searches the house&nbsp;
and walks into the bathroom where he sees an empty&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:34.640
bathtub covered in his wife's blood he starts&nbsp;
to weep believing evelyn is dead then discovers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:40.560
that she is safe and hiding in the shower with&nbsp;
their new baby boy marcus meanwhile is walking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:46.320
back toward the house when he hears an alien he&nbsp;
makes a run for it into the cornfield but runs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:52.400
straight into a tractor tires knocking himself&nbsp;
unconscious lee has taken evelyn to the cellar&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:58.000
and placed his new son into the soundproof [ __&nbsp;
] regan has returned home and notices the beam of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:03.840
marcus's flashlight coming out from the cornfield&nbsp;
but cannot hear the alien coming up behind her but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:09.760
as the alien moves closer regan's cochlear implant&nbsp;
processor starts producing a high-pitched feedback&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:15.280
which distresses the alien causing it to run&nbsp;
off evelyn thinks about bo and regrets that she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:20.880
didn't carry him on that fateful day then before&nbsp;
getting some much-needed sleep makes lee promise&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:26.000
that he will protect their children lee leaves&nbsp;
to look for the kids as we see water rushing down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.920
into the cellar regan finds marcus in there a&nbsp;
tree to the top of the grain silo on top of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:38.800
silo marcus signs don't worry he'll come for us&nbsp;
but regan shakes her head replying he'll come for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:45.760
you later evelyn wakes to find that the cellar has&nbsp;
flooded on top of this an alien has climbed down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:51.360
inside the room and the baby is sleeping in&nbsp;
the soundproof crib but the top is open evelyn&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:56.320
carefully picks up her baby and slinks to the back&nbsp;
of the cellar behind the waterfall flooding the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:02.320
room all of a sudden a hatch on the top of the&nbsp;
silo breaks causing marcus to fall inside of it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:07.120
as he's slowly drowning in the grain the alien&nbsp;
in the cellar with evelyn is drawn out by the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:12.800
noise the hatch breaks away completely and&nbsp;
falls into the silo just missing marcus&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:18.640
regan herself jumps into the silo and&nbsp;
successfully saves her brother by pushing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:24.960
the hatch towards him so he can grab hold of it&nbsp;
however she herself quickly sinks into the grain&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:30.720
marcus climbs onto the hatch and pulls out&nbsp;
his sister to safety regan and marcus both&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:36.240
sit safely atop the silo door but then they&nbsp;
hear a crash on top of the silo the alien&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:41.280
from the flooded cellar jumps in the silo as&nbsp;
the kids cover themselves with the hatch door&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:46.560
they seem doomed until regan's cochlear implant&nbsp;
processor once again lets out a piercing feedback&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:52.960
forcing the alien to crash out the side of the&nbsp;
silo regan and marcus crawl out of the silo&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:58.240
lee has arrived on the scene and meets with the&nbsp;
children but is quickly interrupted by the alien&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:04.160
the children hides on the truck while lee grabs&nbsp;
an axe lee was attacked by the alien which causes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:10.560
marcus to scream upon hearing this the alien heads&nbsp;
for the truck this time when regan's processor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:16.480
starts its piercing feedback she turns it off&nbsp;
now the alien resume its attack on the truck&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:23.280
and trying to rip it open lee who is badly injured&nbsp;
makes eye contact with his daughter and signs i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:30.400
love you i have always loved you he then lets out&nbsp;
a yell to sacrifice himself and save the kids they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:35.440
put the truck into neutral and roll it back to&nbsp;
the house where they reunite with their mother&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:40.480
evelyn and the kids hear the alien approaching so&nbsp;
they retreat back into the house and head down to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:46.640
the basement regan who was never allowed down&nbsp;
there sees for the first time the evidence of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:52.000
all the work her father put into repairing&nbsp;
and creating her cochlear implant processor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.280
she's overwhelmed with emotion just as the lights&nbsp;
begin to flicker the alien walks down into the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:03.760
basement and has them cornered regan however scans&nbsp;
a handwritten scribbling from her dad which read&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:08.240
what is their weakness then takes a quick&nbsp;
glance at the hearing aids on his workbench&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:15.040
and eureka she switches on her cochlear implant&nbsp;
processor creating feedback and causing the alien&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:21.120
to shudder regan then amplifies the feedback by&nbsp;
holding the processor up against a microphone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:26.320
the alien collapses then slowly staggers back&nbsp;
up on its feet but evelyn used the shotgun and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:30.800
blows its head to pieces when they see&nbsp;
on the surveillance monitors that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:35.360
sound of the shotgun has seemingly brought&nbsp;
every alien in the county to their home&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:41.840
regan turns up the speakers while evelyn pumps&nbsp;
the shotgun wearing a rye grin on her face&nbsp;&nbsp;
