00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.960
﻿The film opens at Belle Reve Penitentiary&nbsp;
where Brian Durland or known as Savant is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.520
in his break room throwing a ball around&nbsp;
at targets that he has precisely set up.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.320
He even uses his skills to bounce&nbsp;
the ball off the walls and kill a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:29.840
canary. He is then pulled away by Amanda&nbsp;
Waller as she assigns him to a task.
&nbsp;

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.480
Savant is thrown into Task Force X the&nbsp;
former “Suicide Squad” alongside Blackguard,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.640
Captain Boomerang, Weasel, Mongal, Javelin,&nbsp;
The Detachable Kid, and Harley Quinn.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:50.480
Led by Rick Flag, the team travels to the island&nbsp;
of Corto Maltese for their mission. Upon arriving,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:57.840
Weasel falls into the water and apparently&nbsp;
drowns since nobody knew he couldn’t swim.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.760
When the Squad makes it to land, Blackguard&nbsp;
steps out and reveals he brought the team to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:13.280
mercenaries waiting for them on the beach. For his&nbsp;
troubles, he gets his face blown off. Harley goes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:20.640
in blasting while Boomerang throws his signature&nbsp;
weapon to slice some heads off. TDK’s arms pop off&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:28.000
so he can use them as weapons, but ineffective.&nbsp;
The mercenaries retaliate and shoot TDK and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.240
Javelin dead. Mongal attempts to bring a chopper&nbsp;
down but it crashes and she burns to death.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.920
Boomerang is impaled with wood and&nbsp;
then shredded by the chopper’s blades.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.880
Harley and Flag go missing while&nbsp;
Savant attempts to flee the chaos.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.560
Although Waller warns him, she detonates&nbsp;
the explosive in the back of his head,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.000
causing it to blow up. She then sends&nbsp;
in her second team to finish the job.
&nbsp;

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.960
Three days earlier – Waller goes to recruit&nbsp;
Robert DuBois also known as Bloodsport,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.480
a deadly mercenary who is there for putting&nbsp;
Superman in the ICU with a kryptonite bullet.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.960
Her leverage against him is Bloodsport’s teenage&nbsp;
daughter Tyla, who is in danger of serving time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:25.440
for stealing. The two argue loudly, as Tyla&nbsp;
makes it clear that Bloodsport was a bad father.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.680
He goes to threaten Waller into releasing Tyla,&nbsp;
but she knows he is going to comply regardless.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.120
After he relents, she introduces him&nbsp;
to her other recruits – Christopher&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:43.520
Smith also known as Peacemaker, a patriotic&nbsp;
mercenary; Cleo Cazo alias as Ratcatcher 2,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:49.600
who has the ability to control rats and keeps one&nbsp;
named Sebastian close by; Nanaue or King Shark,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.640
an underwater prince with a taste for human&nbsp;
meat; and Abner Krill known as Polka Dot Man,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.760
a man with an unusual genetic disorder whose&nbsp;
specialty is throwing weaponized polka dots.
&nbsp;

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:06.080
Waller informs the team about the situation&nbsp;
in Corto Maltese – the nation was overthrown&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:11.600
by a dictator named Silvio Luna and his&nbsp;
right-hand man General Mateo Suarez after&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:17.600
they executed the presidential family. They&nbsp;
are operating in a Nazi-era research facility&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:22.480
called Jotunheim where they are conducting&nbsp;
dangerous experiments, codenamed “Project&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:29.280
Starfish”. The Squad is assigned to find&nbsp;
Dr. Gaius Grieves known as The Thinker,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:40.640
since he can lead them to Jotunheim and they can&nbsp;
destroy whatever is going on in there. We jump to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:46.800
the facility where Luna and Suarez are observing&nbsp;
their work, a gigantic starfish alien creature.
&nbsp;

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.840
Presently, while Team 2 is making&nbsp;
their way through the jungle,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.000
they come across a group that they believe to&nbsp;
be mercenaries in league with the military,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.920
so the Squad kills them before they make it&nbsp;
to the camp where Flag is hanging out with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:08.320
his contact Sol Soria, a dissident whose team, the&nbsp;
Freedom Fighters, is trying to take Corto Maltese&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:13.840
back from Luna and Suarez…and unfortunately her&nbsp;
team was the group that the Squad just killed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.960
The team walks out of the jungle when they&nbsp;
notice Polka Dot Man glowing different colors.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:44.880
He explains that his condition happened because&nbsp;
his mother worked at STAR Labs and experimented&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:51.200
on him and his siblings to give them superpowers.&nbsp;
His condition forces him to drain the dots out of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:56.320
him or he will die, and he views all of his&nbsp;
enemies as his mother before killing them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.280
Before heading to Jotunheim, Flag&nbsp;
insists that they recover Harley.
&nbsp;

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:09.360
Harley has been taken captive by Luna’s&nbsp;
men, but he brings her to his room to woo&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.440
her since she is seen in the country&nbsp;
as a symbol of anti-American anarchy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:21.040
Harley is initially charmed by him, and he even&nbsp;
asks her to marry him. However, when he reveals&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:26.320
his plan of using whatever is in Jotunheim&nbsp;
to eliminate anyone who threatens his regime,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:31.920
even if it means killing children. This&nbsp;
crosses Harley and she shoots Luna dead,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:40.880
leading to his men to capture and imprison her.
The Squad is being taken by Sol’s contact Milton&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:46.960
to go to a bar called La Gatita Amable where&nbsp;
they will find Thinker. On the road there,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:53.280
Ratcatcher asks Bloodsport why he is afraid of&nbsp;
rats, as he is always recoiling around Sebastian&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:53.280 --> 00:06:00.160
even though, according to Cleo, he sees good in&nbsp;
Bloodsport. DuBois states that his father once&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:07.200
punished him with rats, and it lead to his phobia.&nbsp;
When he asks her why she is so drawn to rats,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:12.400
she explains that her father, Ratcatcher&nbsp;
1, taught her how to control them but also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:17.600
treat them as family, but he was a drug addict&nbsp;
and ultimately overdosed when she was a child.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:23.200
Bloodsport and Ratcatcher promise to one&nbsp;
another that they will get each other out alive.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.960
The team makes it to the bar, but Nanaue&nbsp;
has to stay behind since he will stick out.
&nbsp;

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:35.600
The Squad drinks and dances&nbsp;
before they spot Thinker.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:45.440
They apprehend him, but the military comes in&nbsp;
to search everyone since they know that there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:51.360
are Americans in there. Bloodsport sends&nbsp;
Ratcatcher outside with Thinker while he,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:54.640
Peacemaker, and Polka Dot Man are all taken in.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:01.840
On the road, the three subdue the gunmen and kill&nbsp;
the driver before their van is run off the road.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:16.000
Ratcatcher and King Shark&nbsp;
arrive with Thinker in tow.
&nbsp;

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:22.320
Harley is being tortured by Suarez’s men for&nbsp;
information, but she never budges. When she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:29.840
is left alone with his guard, she snaps his&nbsp;
neck with her legs and sets herself free.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:41.280
Harley proceeds to shoot down Suarez’s&nbsp;
guards before getting her hands on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:57.840
some blades and Javelin’s…javelin to&nbsp;
slaughter her way through the guards.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:25.840
Outside, Flag tries to lead the Squad to rescue&nbsp;
Harley until she shows up and joins them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:34.880
They then get Thinker and order&nbsp;
him to get them inside Jotunheim.
&nbsp;

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:13.760
Once inside (and after Milton is killed),&nbsp;
Thinker leads the Squad to the creature that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:19.840
he calls Starro The Conqueror. Peacemaker&nbsp;
and Nanaue set up bombs all over the place.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:25.600
Thinker reveals to the Squad that the American&nbsp;
government was behind the experiments involving&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:32.320
Starro since they have been secretly funding&nbsp;
Corto Maltese for decades. Starro also emits&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:37.200
smaller starfish that attach themselves to&nbsp;
human faces and take over their bodies like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:42.160
zombies, and there are slews of corpses of&nbsp;
Starro’s other victims all over the facility.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:49.840
Starro breaks free and grabs Thinker, tearing him&nbsp;
in two and splattering him across the wall. Flag&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:54.800
attempts to secure the hard drive with evidence&nbsp;
against the American government to deliver to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:54.800 --> 00:10:01.520
press, but Peacemaker turns on him per Waller’s&nbsp;
orders. The two fight each other, with Flag nearly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:17.840
choking Peacemaker to death, but he stabs Flag&nbsp;
through the heart with a piece of a broken sink.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:31.840
Ratcatcher witnesses this and grabs the flash&nbsp;
drive while Peacemaker attempts to kill her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:40.880
Meanwhile, Nanaue comes across&nbsp;
small fish that mimic him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:45.840
until their aquarium is broken&nbsp;
and they begin to leech onto him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:56.320
all while Bloodsport, Harley, and Polka Dot&nbsp;
Man try to survive the crumbling facility.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:00.560
Bloodsport manages to survive&nbsp;
going through several stories&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:05.120
before he lands and witnesses Peacemaker&nbsp;
getting ready to execute Ratcatcher.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:16.240
The two mercs draw their guns and fire their&nbsp;
bullets at each other, with Bloodsport’s bullet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:20.320
breaking through Peacemaker’s and striking&nbsp;
him in the throat, bringing him down.
&nbsp;

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:32.000
King Shark falls outside and is shot by&nbsp;
Suarez’s men, but he rises and bites the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:37.520
head off one gunmen before the rest of the Squad&nbsp;
runs out of the facility as Starro bursts out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:44.720
It releases more starfish&nbsp;
that kill Suarez and his men&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:55.840
and then proceeds to make its way into the city.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:11.280
Waller declares the mission over&nbsp;
since the evidence is destroyed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:17.280
but the surviving members want to save the city.&nbsp;
Waller threatens to detonate their devices and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:22.320
kill them on the spot until her subordinate,&nbsp;
Flo Crawley brains her with a golf club and has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:28.320
the rest of the team guide the Squad to save&nbsp;
the city. At the same time, Sol and her team&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:33.040
execute the remaining members of the regime to&nbsp;
stage their coup and take their country back.
&nbsp;

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:40.000
Bloodsport begins blasting away at&nbsp;
Starro while King Shark goes “nom&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:45.600
nom” on the alien and starts to bite into&nbsp;
it. Polka Dot Man envisions Starro as his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:51.840
mother and unleashes his polka dots to burn&nbsp;
Starro’s leg, but the alien crushes him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:07.680
Ratcatcher tries to use her&nbsp;
beacon to summon the rats,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:14.080
but Bloodsport pushes her out of the way before&nbsp;
she is killed. She then uses the beacon and gets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:19.840
practically every rat in the city to take down the&nbsp;
infected citizens and start to take Starro down.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:37.200
Harley then charges into Starro’s eye with the&nbsp;
javelin and breaks through before the rats make&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:47.840
their way inside and take Starro down from the&nbsp;
inside, finally killing it and saving the city.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:57.600
The Squad’s heroics are broadcast on the news,&nbsp;
and Tyla acknowledges her father as a hero.
&nbsp;

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:05.840
Bloodsport contacts Waller, ordering&nbsp;
her to let the team and Tyla go free,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:08.960
or they will leak the evidence&nbsp;
from the laboratory to the press.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:15.840
She reluctantly agrees and calls&nbsp;
for the chopper to bring them home.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:29.840
As the team rests, Sebastian crawls onto&nbsp;
Bloodsport’s leg, and he begins to pet the rat.
&nbsp;

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:40.400
Mid-Credits Scene: Weasel is&nbsp;
shown to still be alive and starts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:49.680
wandering into the jungle of Corto Maltese.
Post-Credits Scene: Waller’s subordinates John&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:55.440
Economos and Emilia Harcourt are brought to a room&nbsp;
where they find that Peacemaker is still alive,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:59.520
because Waller needs him, as Harcourt&nbsp;
puts it, “to save the world.”
