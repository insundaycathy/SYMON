00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:06.240
﻿If a serial killer’s soul inhabited a toy doll&nbsp;
you bought for your son, what would you do?
&nbsp;

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.480
In this How to Beat video, we’ll follow the&nbsp;
Barclays, see if we can make better decisions,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.880
and ultimately attempt to beat Chucky in Child's&nbsp;
Play. If you think you have a better way,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.680
let me know in the comments! If&nbsp;

We start out following Charles Lee Ray,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:54.880
a serial killer on the run from homicide detective&nbsp;
Mike Norris. His getaway driver, Eddie Caputo,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.200
panics when the cops show up and takes off&nbsp;
without him. Should have hired Baby instead.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.400
He gets cornered into a toy store and&nbsp;
takes a shot to the right lung. 
&nbsp;

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.880
This store can’t be that big. Shouting your&nbsp;
monologue like that should make it easy for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.120
Mike to find and kill you. They obviously&nbsp;
upped the reverb in the audio for effect,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.680
because there’s no way Mike would be that&nbsp;
clueless as to the origin of Charle’s voice.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.840
He should be able to just run up&nbsp;
on him and get to blasting.
&nbsp;

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.960
Bro, seriously, how can you not find the one&nbsp;
guy yelling like a maniac in an empty store&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:37.360
at night and take him down. Look at this&nbsp;
shot, the building is not that big.
&nbsp;

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.240
Mr. Magoo is too busy getting turned around in&nbsp;
the tiny toy store to stop Charles from casting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.040
some voodoo spells which transfer his soul out&nbsp;
of his dying body and into a Good Guys doll.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.000
Yah, there’s no way Mike could have&nbsp;
anticipated that move though.
&nbsp;

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.920
I know this guy is a bit unhinged at the moment,&nbsp;
but transferring your soul into a ‘sterile’,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.560
plastic doll seems like a fresh hell you would&nbsp;
want no part of. Guess it’s better than the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.200
witch in Friend Request having to hang herself&nbsp;
over a bonfire in order to transfer her soul&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.600
into the black mirror, computer dimension.&nbsp;
I don’t know, which would you rather your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.320
soul be transferred into, a black mirror&nbsp;
dimension, or a Chucky doll? Personally,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:20.160
I'd just take the L and go out guns blazing. 
The soul transference causes a massive explosion&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:26.000
sending Mike flying ass first&nbsp;
through the toy store.
&nbsp;

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.480
The morning after the incident, we start following&nbsp;
Andy on his birthday. The only thing more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.440
disturbing than his breakfast is his infatuation&nbsp;
with the Good Guys doll. It just seems weird to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.880
me. Action figures and little green army men make&nbsp;
sense. But a cabbage patch kids doll nearly the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:45.840
size of a 6 year old would, i’d think, be creepy&nbsp;
to a kid. I’m just glad that nowadays you can buy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.920
a kid a tablet with an internet connection and&nbsp;
be good. All these parents bitching about their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.000
kids being inseparable from their phones need&nbsp;
to realize that their alternative could be a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.400
bunch of creepy dolls left all over the house that&nbsp;
may or may not come to life and murder you.
&nbsp;

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.360
Andy’s mom is struggling to make ends meet,&nbsp;
and can’t afford the $100 price to buy him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:09.200
his favorite psycho doll at retail stores. Who&nbsp;
the fuck would pay $100 for that doll. I’d pay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:14.400
$100 to not have that doll in my possession.&nbsp;
Alas, she doesn’t want to disappoint Andy,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.400
so to make his birthday special she&nbsp;
resorts to buying a doll off a suspect&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.800
homeless man who no doubt looted it. 
What’re the odds that he snagged the one with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.920
Charles Lee Ray inside it. Actually, the explosion&nbsp;
probably destroyed most of the other dolls,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:32.960
with the voodoo magic protecting the Chucky one.&nbsp;
So fairly likely considering he’d want to steal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.280
the one undamaged one.
Now that I think of it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:45.520
this is like the Turboman from hell.
Andy’s mom has to pull a second shift,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:50.480
so she has her friend Maggie babysit him. While&nbsp;
babysitting, Andy tells her that Chucky wants to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:55.440
watch the 9 o’clock news. Shouldn’t a six year&nbsp;
old be smart enough to realize that something&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.600
is off about this doll. Guess not.
The real nightmare begins after Maggie puts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:05.120
Andy to bed, and then finds Chucky watching the&nbsp;
news on Eddie Caputo’s escape from prison.
&nbsp;

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:10.560
Disconcerting, but the only reasonable explanation&nbsp;
a sane person would conclude is that Andy put him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:15.120
there. She puts Chucky back, kicks up on the&nbsp;
couch, but then she hears and sees something&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:20.080
sneak past her out of the corner of her eye.
Hmm, must have been my imagination. She then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.000
hears another noise in the hallway. As&nbsp;
far as she’d think, it’s Andy staying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.240
up and playing with his stupid doll.
Side note: I hate couches like that with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:33.120
your backside exposed, anyone can sneak up on you&nbsp;
and slip some piano wire around your neck. 
&nbsp;

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:40.480
Like i’ve talked about in previous&nbsp;
videos, following strange sounds like this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:43.840
is like following an evil jelly&nbsp;
bean trail right into a trap.
&nbsp;

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:47.440
At this point, i’d yell at Andy to stop&nbsp;
fucking around unless he wants me to get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:52.000
the belt out. This is a pretty common sense&nbsp;
move. Andy would come out of his bedroom,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.160
at which point Maggie would realize that&nbsp;
he didn’t open the front door or make the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:01.040
noises in the living room. At which point she&nbsp;
should grab Andy, leave the apartment, and call&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:06.000
the cops because there may be an intruder.
Maggie decides to tiptoe into the kitchen where a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.040
jar of flour was knocked over, and&nbsp;
immediately lets her guard down.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:17.920
What? That jar didn’t knock itself over. 
She then hears another noise behind some flowers.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:22.080
How Chucky made those noises when he&nbsp;
wasn’t over there doesn’t make sense,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.840
but Maggie falls for the setup and takes&nbsp;
a tiny toy hammer to the face.
&nbsp;

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:37.920
This is why you need a dog. There’s no way Chucky&nbsp;
could have snuck around and gotten the jump on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:41.920
her like this with a shepherd around.
Also, whoever designed those windows needs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:46.480
to be fired. There’s no way it’s legal&nbsp;
to have windows that are that fragile&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:51.120
in place on a 10th story apartment. 
Karen clocks out and heads home to find cops and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:56.080
ambulances everywhere. She proceeds to walk&nbsp;
straight past the crime scene tape, past all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:01.680
the cops, and literally walks right into the crime&nbsp;
scene without anyone stopping her or noticing. I’m&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:06.480
pretty sure that’s not allowed, because she could&nbsp;
be fucking up all the evidence, but okay.
&nbsp;

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:11.200
Detective Mike Norris is on the case, back&nbsp;
on duty not a day after being involved in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:15.120
a fatal shootout and getting blown up&nbsp;
in a freak toy store explosion.
&nbsp;

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:23.440
He ascertains that she was hit in the face by a&nbsp;
toy hammer from a child sized person standing on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:29.360
the counter, as evidenced by the footprints.
Obviously Andy murdered Maggie because she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:33.440
wouldn’t let him stay up late watching cartoons&nbsp;
and eating sugary bowls of cereal.
&nbsp;

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:42.480
Sure there are footprints on the counter, but if&nbsp;
you took a second to check the sizing of Andy’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:47.200
shoes, you’d realize they didn’t match. Kid was&nbsp;
probably playing with the doll on the counter,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:51.520
then someone broke in thinking that nobody was&nbsp;
home since Karen had to pull a second shift.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:54.960
When the intruder realized Maggie&nbsp;
was home, a tussle occurred and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.960 --> 00:08:01.280
Maggie got shoved out the window.
Karen flips out when Mike suggests Andy was a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:05.840
suspect, and orders the police to clear out of her&nbsp;
home. I don’t think that’s how these things work&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:10.800
lady. I think you need to go get a hotel room for&nbsp;
the night, while the detectives investigate the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:20.640
crime scene and question witnesses.
Oh, you mean like a homicide detective&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:24.160
trying to solve the murder of your&nbsp;
friend. Yah, they’re so pesky.
&nbsp;

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:28.080
At the end of the day, it doesn’t matter&nbsp;
because nobody will suspect the doll as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:31.760
being the murderer. There’s not much Andy&nbsp;
can do because Chucky will have threatened&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:35.840
him with death if he tries anything.
Karen sits Andy down to try to find out what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:41.920
happened. Andy says that Chucky told him his real&nbsp;
name is Charles Lee Ray. Your son saying his doll&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:47.840
calls himself by a infamous serial killer's name&nbsp;
would be off putting, but it’s possible she didn’t&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:58.000
see the news and doesn’t recognize the name.
What an absolute savage. He probably should have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.160
just kept his mouth shut on that one.
Karen leaves the room and tries to snoop on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:07.600
Andy’s conversations with his doll. She’s got the&nbsp;
right idea, but her execution is flawed. The light&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:12.560
behind her casts a shadow into the room, which&nbsp;
betrays her presence. It shouldn’t be hard to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:17.280
realize you’re casting a shadow and Andy could see&nbsp;
that you’re still there, in which case he won’t&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:21.840
reveal whatever weird shit he’s up to. It’s like&nbsp;
trying to spy out your window at night with the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:26.880
lights on behind you. I guess you can’t expect the&nbsp;
jewelry saleswoman at Macy’s to be tactical.
&nbsp;

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:31.920
If she was a better spy she might have been&nbsp;
able to overhear something. Still unlikely, as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:36.880
Chucky would be quietly whispering to Andy.
The next morning Karen drops Andy off at school,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:41.520
but under the threat of murder and ending up&nbsp;
like Maggie, Andy takes Chucky to where Chucky&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:44.960
thinks Eddie Caputo is hiding.
I get that Andy is a six year old,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:49.600
so this strategy might not have dawned on him.&nbsp;
But he could go along with the plan initially,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:55.120
grab a lighter from home, then take Chucky to&nbsp;
a public place and set him on fire. If Chucky&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:55.120 --> 00:10:00.240
fought back, everyone nearby would witness a&nbsp;
doll coming to life and help Andy destroy it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:05.200
If Chucky did nothing, the doll would simply&nbsp;
burn to ashes along with Charle’s soul. 
&nbsp;

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.160
I’m starting to think the Good Guys doll&nbsp;
company is brainwashing these kids through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:18.480
subliminal messaging in their shows. How&nbsp;
else could you explain Andy running into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:22.640
a dilapidated ghetto building that&nbsp;
he just heard gunshots coming from,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:28.000
likely from the escaped fugitive Chucky told him&nbsp;
he was trying to find, to rescue a doll that was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.960
possessed by a serial killer who murdered his&nbsp;
babysitter and had threatened to kill him if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:38.560
he didn’t do what it said. Just run home.
Chucky rigs up a classic homemade gas bomb with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:45.840
the oven, lays another evil Jelly Bean trail of&nbsp;
strange noises, and Eddy falls for the bait.
&nbsp;

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:54.960
If there was that much gas in the building, you’d&nbsp;
think Eddie would have smelled it and bounced.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:59.600
Or at least not have kicked open the door to the&nbsp;
kitchen and started blasting away at shadows.
&nbsp;

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:03.840
Good thing Andy wised up and walked away&nbsp;
from the dope house before it exploded.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:09.600
Somehow this six year old boy became the primary&nbsp;
suspect for the murder, and with no evidence they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:15.040
sentence him to a psychiatric hospital. Poor Andy,&nbsp;
he’s just getting shit on from both sides. 
&nbsp;

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:19.440
Karen takes the Chucky doll back home to&nbsp;
interrogate it. From her perspective, she’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:24.240
clearly losing her mind. Somewhat understandable&nbsp;
given the events that have unfolded.
&nbsp;

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:28.640
As tempting as it is to put the doll in the&nbsp;
oven and crank the temp up, she’s desperate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:32.720
to prove her son is innocent. Destroying&nbsp;
the doll wouldn’t help Andy’s case. 
&nbsp;

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:36.720
If she wanted to prove Andy was innocent&nbsp;
and thought that the doll might be alive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:42.320
because again, she’s losing it mentally, then&nbsp;
why not force the doll to make a move while&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:47.200
you were in the police station? All you’d need to&nbsp;
do is start ripping its legs and arms off. 
&nbsp;

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:52.720
Karen picks up the box Chucky came in, and the&nbsp;
batteries fall out. Now it’s getting creepy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:57.280
She then hesitantly picks the doll up to check&nbsp;
if there were batteries preinstalled.
&nbsp;

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:06.960
It’s not a 100% confirmation that the&nbsp;
doll is alive, but it’s pretty god damn&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:11.040
close. Close enough that she should just&nbsp;
destroy it the next chance she gets.
&nbsp;

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:15.200
I would not be sticking my head under the&nbsp;
couch like that, you’re just asking to get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:19.920
a toy knife shoved in your eye. She should&nbsp;
just flip the couch over then grab him.
&nbsp;

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:24.400
Karen wises up, lights the fireplace and threatens&nbsp;
to throw him in unless he says something.
&nbsp;

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:36.880
I’m not sure what she was expecting. Of course&nbsp;
if Chucky was real like she was trying to prove,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:39.840
he would be forced to fight her when&nbsp;
she threatened him like that. I don’t&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:42.240
think she was anticipating him being that strong,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:47.360
but she did suspect that he murdered Maggie, which&nbsp;
would indicate that he had some level of strength,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:50.480
which would mean that he might be more&nbsp;
difficult to handle than she’d think.
&nbsp;

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:55.200
The general idea here is that you don’t threaten&nbsp;
to kill someone unless you’re in a definitively&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:55.200 --> 00:13:00.320
advantageous position to carry out the killing.&nbsp;
Karen wasn’t. She shouldn’t have revealed her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:05.360
intentions before securing her position of power&nbsp;
over him. Basically, she should’ve taken him over&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:10.640
to the kitchen to ‘read the instructions on&nbsp;
the box he came in’ and then stuffed him in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:14.160
the oven. From there she could threaten him&nbsp;
and he wouldn’t be able to fight back.
&nbsp;

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:17.840
Throwing chucky across the room was&nbsp;
a dumb move too. The fireplace was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:21.760
literally right next to you, why not throw&nbsp;
him in there if it was so easy. 
&nbsp;

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:26.640
Chucky’s power comes from his ability to surprise&nbsp;
his prey. Knowing he can’t win a fight with her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:31.280
head to head, he runs off. Karen could just&nbsp;
let the doll go, nobody will believe her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:35.520
and she’s not equipped to deal with that kind of&nbsp;
threat. She will still be able to get Andy back,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:40.000
because with no actual evidence condemning Andy&nbsp;
as a murderer, they can’t keep him locked up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.800
in a psych ward for long. Still, Chucky&nbsp;
murdered Maggie and ruined Andy’s life.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:49.040
Revenge is running through her veins.
If she wants any chance at finding Chucky,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:54.960
she needs to find out more about Charles Lee Ray,&nbsp;
his home, his motivations, his friends and family.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:54.960 --> 00:14:00.080
She goes to the police station again, but Mike’s&nbsp;
no help, so she decides her next best option is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:05.200
to wander back alleys by herself in search of&nbsp;
the creepy peddler who sold her the doll. 
&nbsp;

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:09.280
Unsurprisingly, that peddler’s less than&nbsp;
empathetic about her situation.
&nbsp;

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:17.520
She got lucky the detective actually gave a&nbsp;
shit about her to follow her and make sure she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:22.240
was safe. This movie easily could have turned&nbsp;
into a I Spit on Your Grave crossover.
&nbsp;

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:27.040
Mike reveals to her that he killed Charles Lee&nbsp;
Ray, but that Charles had been yelling voodoo&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:31.360
chants before getting struck by lightning. He&nbsp;
still doesn’t believe the doll is alive yet,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:35.840
but it’s weird enough that he heads back to the&nbsp;
police station to reopen the investigation.
&nbsp;

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:38.880
Let’s do some bad detective&nbsp;
work from Mike’s POV.
&nbsp;

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:44.880
He fatally wounded Charles Lee Ray in a toy store,&nbsp;
but before he died he was yelling voodoo chants.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:50.720
On a clear night sky, storm clouds rolled in above&nbsp;
and lightning hit Charles directly. You later&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:56.160
found him next to a Good Guys doll. You just found&nbsp;
out that Karen bought one of those same dolls from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:56.160 --> 00:15:01.920
a peddler who looted it from that same store&nbsp;
the morning after the incident. Then that night,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:07.280
Karen’s friend was murdered. The next day,&nbsp;
Eddie Caputo, the man he swore to get back,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:12.240
got murdered as well. And then there’s&nbsp;
Mike, the other man he swore to get back at.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:15.200
If that doesn’t make you a bit&nbsp;
paranoid I don’t know what will.
&nbsp;

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:19.280
On his way back to his car, Mike makes the&nbsp;
rookie mistake of getting into his car without&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:25.840
checking the backseat, you’d think he would&nbsp;
consider everything we just talked about.
&nbsp;

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:33.360
Now Mike has a killer doll trying to stab&nbsp;
his balls through the car seat while he’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:37.760
going 40 miles per hour. There’s no way&nbsp;
this ends well. To make matters worse,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:42.800
the brake pedal on his cheap piece of shit car&nbsp;
falls off while Chucky jams the accelerator.
&nbsp;

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:48.080
Mike spins the car out safely, but then stupidly&nbsp;
straightens the wheel out which enables the car to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:52.880
gain lethal levels of speed again. If he just&nbsp;
held the steering wheel cranked to the side,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:56.720
the car wouldn’t be able to gain any&nbsp;
speed. He’d just be doing donuts. Of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:56.720 --> 00:16:01.360
course that still leaves the problem of Chucky,&nbsp;
but without the threat of a high speed collision&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:06.240
he can focus on fucking the doll up.
This mistake made the car uncontrollable and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:11.040
a crash inevitable. I always hate these scenes&nbsp;
in movies where the person is floundering in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:15.600
the upside down car while being attacked.&nbsp;
Inside an upside down car is the worst&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:20.560
position you could possibly be in. I know he&nbsp;
just crashed and is probably disoriented, but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:25.040
he seems to be with it, so he should’ve&nbsp;
been able to crawl his ass out ASAP.
&nbsp;

00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:29.680
Even though he was disoriented and jacked up&nbsp;
on adrenaline from the crash, Mike is able to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:34.000
land a shot on Chucky's shoulder, forcing him&nbsp;
to flee to his voodoo doctor for help.
&nbsp;

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:47.200
His voodoo teacher answers that the more time he&nbsp;
spends in that body, the more human he becomes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:52.000
and that eventually he will be stuck in that body&nbsp;
forever if he doesn’t transfer his soul out of it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.640
soon. This is why you want to read the fine print&nbsp;
on the voodoo rituals before using them.
&nbsp;

00:16:56.640 --> 00:17:00.880
Naturally Chucky wants answers as to how&nbsp;
to transfer his soul out of the doll,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:05.120
but John refuses, declaring him an&nbsp;
abomination that must be stopped.
&nbsp;

00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:09.760
John, John, John. Why would you&nbsp;
reveal your intentions prematurely?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:14.160
You know you are dealing with a magic doll&nbsp;
possessed by the soul of a serial killer,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:17.600
who you think needs to be stopped. Of&nbsp;
course he’s going to get pissed and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:21.440
attack you when you refuse to help him.
You should have just gone along with trying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:23.600
to help him, while plotting&nbsp;
out a way to defeat him. 
&nbsp;

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:37.600
He’s right you know. Telling a serial killer&nbsp;
the location of your personal voodoo doll was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:42.240
flat out idiotic. Why even have a voodoo&nbsp;
doll like that around in the first place.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:46.080
That’s like wearing a bomb vest and keeping&nbsp;
the detonator on the counter. At least&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:50.000
put it in a vault for christ's sake.
John’s stupidity leads to him getting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.400
tortured into telling Chucky that in order&nbsp;
to get out of the doll, he needs to swap&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:58.480
souls with the first person he revealed&nbsp;
himself too, which would be Andy.
&nbsp;

00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:01.280
John screwed up here again.&nbsp;
By giving Chucky the answer,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:05.360
he just gave up his only bargaining chip&nbsp;
and immediately became expendable.
&nbsp;

00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:14.640
Karen and Mike show up just after the stabbing.&nbsp;
John holds out long enough to mutter that he was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:19.920
an asshole and told Chucky to swap souls with her&nbsp;
child. He does also mention that the only way to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:24.320
kill Chucky was to shoot him through the heart he&nbsp;
was forming. They don’t have time to fact check&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:28.080
this, but it sounds plausible. 
Jesus they really put a six year old&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:32.144
in a derelict psychiatric prison because&nbsp;
they thought it wasn’t healthy for a six&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:32.144 --> 00:18:36.560
year old to have an imaginary friend after&nbsp;
the kid suffered immense psychological trauma&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:41.360
from witnessing a murder. Yah this prison is&nbsp;
definitely a healthier way to rehabilitate him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:45.680
than seeing a therapist 2 times a week. 
Andy spots Chucky coming for him, and after&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:51.520
seeing what he’s capable of, knows that this is&nbsp;
bad news. He stages a classic prison escapee move&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:56.160
by putting pillows under the sheets to fake&nbsp;
Chucky out so he could grab the keys and run.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:56.160 --> 00:19:00.400
While not guaranteed to work because he couldn’t&nbsp;
have relied on Chucky dropping the keys,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:04.240
and Chucky could have entered through the&nbsp;
window bars, it’s still a pretty good plan,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:07.680
especially for a six year old. Not sure&nbsp;
there was much else he could have done.
&nbsp;

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:13.040
Andy’s kind of screwed regardless. There’s nowhere&nbsp;
to run, so the psycho doctor catches him and tries&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:16.720
to inject him with a tranquilizer.
Chucky also catches up with them and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:23.840
gives the doctor a taste of his&nbsp;
own electro-shock therapy. 
&nbsp;

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:29.760
While Chucky is getting hot and bothered watching&nbsp;
the doctor get electrocuted to death, Andy escapes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:34.400
back to his home. This is such an obvious move&nbsp;
that Chucky would anticipate. I still think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:39.120
going to a public location surrounded by people&nbsp;
and pay phoning his mom would be best. 
&nbsp;

00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:48.080
Sure enough, Chucky’s right on his tail.
Haha I just had to include that.
&nbsp;

00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:53.120
Andy would know by now that Chucky is actually&nbsp;
pretty strong, and he probably wouldn’t win a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:58.560
physical altercation against him. However, hiding&nbsp;
in a closet is a terrible idea, because it’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:03.440
literally the first place anyone checks. 
Andy opts for a frontal engagement with his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:06.000
toy bat. Bro, why not grab a&nbsp;
knife from the kitchen. 
&nbsp;

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.480
Doesn’t really matter though, Andy’s not going&nbsp;
to be outsmarting what is essentially a mid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:14.480
30 year old serial killer that has much&nbsp;
more experience hunting humans.
&nbsp;

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:23.360
Karen and Mike better hustle their asses up or&nbsp;
Andy’s going to swap bodies with Chucky.
&nbsp;

00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:27.680
Dude just shoot the lock, that weak ass&nbsp;
shouldering is wasting precious time.
&nbsp;

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:32.400
They bust in and throw the doll across the room,&nbsp;
then both proceed to ignore it like it isn’t&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:37.120
capable of murdering them. Again, stop throwing&nbsp;
your enemies and giving them the opportunity to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:41.680
re engage. You especially don’t want Chucky&nbsp;
escaping and coming back to kill you at a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:45.760
later date when your guard is down.
And again, stop bending down to check&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:49.280
under the beds and making yourself&nbsp;
vulnerable. Just flip the bed.
&nbsp;

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:59.120
Who’d have thought Karen owned a gat. She lands&nbsp;
a solid hit on Chucky’s leg, but her gun jams so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:03.600
she tosses it on the floor and runs.
The gun jamming was likely caused by her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:08.720
limp wristing it. Common for inexperienced&nbsp;
shooters. Basically, she didn’t hold a stiff&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:13.040
enough grip on the pistol frame to prevent&nbsp;
it from traveling rearward while the slide&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:18.080
was cycling back and forth. Thus the action&nbsp;
couldn’t generate enough opposing force to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:22.800
properly eject and seat a new round. 
She didn’t have the time or experience to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:27.280
remediate it before Chucky charged again, but&nbsp;
throwing it on the ground infront of him was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:31.840
incredibly stupid. Not only did you give up your&nbsp;
only weapons which you could have run off with and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:36.080
cleared by pulling the mag out and cycling the&nbsp;
action, but Chucky could have picked the pistol&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:40.000
up, cleared the jam, and used it against you.
It’s a good thing Chucky’s stupid too,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.840
because he runs past the gun to try to&nbsp;
physically fight people way stronger&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:48.240
than him. Karen overpowers him and this time,&nbsp;
manages to throw him in the fireplace. 
&nbsp;

00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:59.280
There’s no reason you shouldn’t have tried&nbsp;
to hold the gate shut so Chucky fully melted&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:02.640
down and didn’t run through your living&nbsp;
room lighting everything on fire.
&nbsp;

00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:07.840
Karen and Andy both leave the doll to go check&nbsp;
on Mike, which is a mistake. Mike only got a cut&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:11.920
and bopped in the head with a toy bat, he&nbsp;
wasn’t fatally wounded in any way. 
&nbsp;

00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:15.520
This serial killer doll is&nbsp;
possessed by strong voodoo magic,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:19.760
so there’s no way you can be sure it’s dead after&nbsp;
burning it up a bit. The only way to make sure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:24.400
it won’t come back to kill you is to put it back&nbsp;
in the fireplace and melt it down to ashes.
&nbsp;

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:29.280
Karen then sends Andy to walk past the&nbsp;
presumed dead killer doll to get the first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:34.240
aid kit, by himself. How about Mike gets off&nbsp;
his ass and you all make sure Chucky is 100%&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:38.720
dead before sending Andy off to get&nbsp;
Mike a dora the explorer band aid.
&nbsp;

00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:43.040
Surprise surprise, the magic doll&nbsp;
you crisped up a bit isn’t dead.
&nbsp;

00:22:55.920 --> 00:23:00.240
Say what you want about the Good Guys company, but&nbsp;
they sure do know how to make a durable doll.
&nbsp;

00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:05.280
Blowing Chucky into pieces is effective&nbsp;
at incapacitating him, but again,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:09.120
she needs to vaporize the doll.&nbsp;
It’s obvious now that the magic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:12.720
and Charle’s soul will persist&nbsp;
until it’s gone completely.
&nbsp;

00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:17.120
Mike’s detective friend shows up, casually&nbsp;
waltzing into the apartment after hearing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:22.880
all those gunshots pop off. He’s understandably&nbsp;
in disbelief, it’s not like they had body cams,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:26.000
but he gets his introduction to&nbsp;
Chucky’s rage soon enough.
&nbsp;

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:36.000
I still don’t understand how a blown to pieces&nbsp;
doll has enough strength to fight an adult&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:41.200
human. It’s missing an arm and a leg too, it&nbsp;
shouldn’t have any leverage to hold on with.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:45.360
Magic voodoo, how does it even work.
Karen finally remembers what the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:51.440
voodoo doc said.
The movie ends with them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:56.640
leaving the scene to go to a hospital.
