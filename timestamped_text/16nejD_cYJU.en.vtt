joins the boys at their hideout and jasper tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:25.120
horace that they should keep her around because&nbsp;
having a girl might make her seem like an innocent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.560
distraction to people they plan to rob is stella&nbsp;
dyes her hair to go along with the schemes and be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:36.560
unrecognizable ten years later estella continues&nbsp;
to pull off crimes with horus and jasper to&nbsp;&nbsp;

estella's birthday the brothers surprise her with&nbsp;
a job for the liberty department store downtown&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:54.640
since jasper had noticed her always staring at&nbsp;
the place she's very grateful to them estella&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.680
begins working at liberty as a cleaning woman&nbsp;
for a rotten boss named gerald he never gives&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:06.080
estella a chance to present her ideas and treats&nbsp;
her awfully horace and jasper bring her lunch and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:11.760
horace thinks the place can be robbed but estella&nbsp;
wants to work honestly only to have the trash she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:17.600
is taking out get poured onto her when the bag&nbsp;
rips open gerald then brings her back in and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:22.960
tells her to clean overnight she steals a liquor&nbsp;
bottle from his office that night and goes to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:29.680
the window display which is stella finds hideous&nbsp;
estella wakes up hungover by the window with horus&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:35.360
jasper and other patrons seeing the display which&nbsp;
is stella changed radically to appeal more to her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:40.880
style gerald season prepares to fire estella&nbsp;
until he is informed that the baroness who owns&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:46.880
the store is arriving estella hides with horace&nbsp;
and jasper who proceed to nick gerald's wallet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:53.520
and grab a few goodies the baroness asks who did&nbsp;
the window display which she actually likes gerald&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:58.960
says that estella is the culprit and is being&nbsp;
fired but she instead tells her assistant jeffrey&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:04.800
to give estella her business card estella runs&nbsp;
off with abaddons in celebration of moving on up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:10.560
estella begins to work at house of baroness&nbsp;
coming up with dress ideas and designs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:16.160
she sees very quickly that the baroness is&nbsp;
a cold and soulless woman who only critiques&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:21.920
the work of her employers and has rather&nbsp;
sociopathic tendencies such as using a razor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:28.000
to cut the sleeves off as stella's design and not&nbsp;
care when she accidentally nixes stella's hand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.080
after work she stops by a shop operated by a man&nbsp;
named artie who quickly befriends estella since&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:40.320
she likes his fashion sense she also notices&nbsp;
a red dress made by the baroness in the window&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:45.520
throughout her time working estella shows the&nbsp;
baroness that she truly does have a talent for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:51.760
fashion however estella changes her tune toward&nbsp;
the baroness when she sees that she is wearing her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:57.280
mother's necklace despite the baroness claiming&nbsp;
it is a family heirloom when she tells estella&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:02.960
that a former employer tried to rob her and then&nbsp;
fell off a cliff estella begins to feel pure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:09.040
hatred for the baroness estella brings the news&nbsp;
to horus and jasper seeing it as an opportunity&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:15.040
to pull off a heist especially seeing as how the&nbsp;
baroness is set to host an upcoming gala estella&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:20.640
memorizes the baroness's schedule and how the&nbsp;
guards work and move around to plan for the heist&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:26.640
she knows that she will be recognized if she tries&nbsp;
to attend but she knows someone who can arrive on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:32.640
the night of the gala horus and jasper sneak into&nbsp;
the building under the guise of pest exterminators&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:39.200
using wink as a fake rat jasper then makes his&nbsp;
way to the security cameras as the heist commences&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:45.440
estella leaves her wig off and retains her natural&nbsp;
hair showing up in disguise as cruella and wearing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:50.880
the baroness's dress she saw in artie's shop&nbsp;
she stuns everyone in attendance including the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:56.640
typically unimpressed baroness also viewing&nbsp;
and astonished is anita who is a journalist&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:02.000
and recognizes estella from her hair estella&nbsp;
subdues the baroness's guards before having&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.680
a seat with the baroness when horace approaches&nbsp;
the safe with the necklace he finds it empty and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:13.840
estella sees that the baroness is wearing it just&nbsp;
as the baroness realizes cruella is trespassing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:19.600
jasper sets off some rats into the party causing&nbsp;
a distraction that allows estella to snatch&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:25.840
the necklace off the baroness and give to buddy&nbsp;
unfortunately the baroness's dalmatians come out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:31.520
and one of them swallows it after trying to take&nbsp;
it back from buddy estella sees that the baroness&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:36.720
is using a whistle to control the dogs which is&nbsp;
what she also used when catherine died meaning&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:42.560
the baroness deliberately called upon her dogs to&nbsp;
kill katherine after their truck is towed estella&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:48.640
hot wears a car to get away with abaddons and&nbsp;
their dogs estella stops and cries over the fact&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:54.880
that her boss murdered her mother the next morning&nbsp;
is stella is still acting as her cruella persona&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:54.880 --> 00:07:00.480
ordering horus and jasper to steal the baroness's&nbsp;
dog so one of them can pass the necklace&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:06.240
estella then goes off to anita's workplace still&nbsp;
as cruella and asks her to get the word out about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:12.640
her personal exploits meanwhile horus and jasper&nbsp;
find the dalmatians as they are being given baths&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:17.600
and they use wink as bait to get them to come&nbsp;
out before taking them away in a van cruella&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:23.040
soon begins to crash many more events held by the&nbsp;
baroness and with anita covering it in the paper&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:28.640
cruella becomes a fashion sensation completely&nbsp;
upstaging and overshadowing the baroness&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:34.240
she grows more and more agitated even firing her&nbsp;
lawyer roger for failing to have cruella arrested&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:38.720
then instructs estella to come up with a&nbsp;
new design for an upcoming spring collection&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:45.200
presentation estella orders a special material and&nbsp;
creates the dress which the baroness is clearly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:51.120
impressed by although she plans to take credit&nbsp;
for it estella has horus and jasper sneak into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:56.320
house of baroness and create a commotion to make&nbsp;
it appear as though cruella tried to break in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:02.240
leading the baroness to have her dresses stored&nbsp;
inside a top secret vault back at home estella's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:07.920
increasingly arrogant behavior has begun to put a&nbsp;
strain on her relationship with horus and jasper&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:13.600
the baroness holds her spring collection show but&nbsp;
when they open the vault a swarm of moths fly out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:19.040
having torn through almost all the dresses this&nbsp;
is because the material with which estella made&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:25.680
her dress were special cocoons outside horace&nbsp;
and jasper accompanied by artie put on a real&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:31.680
show where artie sings i wanna be your dog and&nbsp;
cruella emerges with a dress made of dalmatian fur&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:38.000
leading the baroness to think the cruella killed&nbsp;
her dogs when estella returns home she finds horus&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:43.600
and jasper tied up with the baroness and her&nbsp;
henchman having deduced the cruelett is estella&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:48.640
the henchman grab estella and tie her to a&nbsp;
chair with the baroness planning to have horus&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:54.480
and jasper framed for killing cruella in a fire&nbsp;
estella fires back that she knows the baroness&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:54.480 --> 00:09:00.000
killed her mother but by her words she is implied&nbsp;
to have killed others when she doesn't immediately&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:06.160
know who estella is talking about she leaves&nbsp;
estella plus buddy and wink to burn but estella&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:12.640
sees a mysterious figure coming together the&nbsp;
place burns down and word spreads that cruella has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:20.000
died estella wakes up in john's house along with&nbsp;
buddy and wink he brings her catherine's necklace&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:25.040
and lets her know that it's been thoroughly&nbsp;
bleached which to estella's surprise contains a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:31.840
key to a box inside the box is a birth certificate&nbsp;
of estellas john then reveals that the baroness&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:37.360
is estella's true biological mother although the&nbsp;
baron did want children the baroness thought being&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:43.280
a mother would hinder her success so she ordered&nbsp;
john to have the baby killed after she was born&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:49.520
but he instead found catherine and gave estella&nbsp;
to her so she can be raised properly estella is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:56.080
in disbelief and runs away stealing a motorcycle&nbsp;
from a delivery boy she rides back to regents park&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:56.080 --> 00:10:01.840
where she addresses the spaces catherine while she&nbsp;
is in disbelief of being lied to about katherine&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:07.200
not being her mother she still viewed her as such&nbsp;
and now decides to embrace her new identity as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:12.880
cruella born brilliant bad and a little bit&nbsp;
mad estella gets a truck and busts through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:18.160
the front of the police station then sets wink&nbsp;
inside to get a key to horus and jasper's cells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:23.920
although they break out they are still mad at&nbsp;
estella for how she treated them after she tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:29.680
them about the baroness being her real mother they&nbsp;
go back to john's home where she says that horace&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:35.360
and jasper are her family they then gather to come&nbsp;
up with a final plan to bring down the baroness&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:40.400
and estella later goes to artie for help as&nbsp;
well horace comes back with the baroness's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:46.080
panther devil carr and estella likes the sound&nbsp;
of the name the baroness hosts another ball&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:52.320
where all in attendance are wearing wigs to honor&nbsp;
cruella estella grabs a pin and pokes the baroness&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:57.360
distracting her long enough to grab her dog&nbsp;
whistle she uses it to bring the dalmatians&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:04.640
outside by the cliffside horace jasper artie&nbsp;
and john gather people to start heading outside&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:10.480
estella gets the dalmatians to obey her and then&nbsp;
reveals to the baroness that she is her daughter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:15.680
the baroness once again takes credit for estella's&nbsp;
talent and pretends to want to take over the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:22.480
business alongside her she approaches her as if to&nbsp;
hug her but instead pushes estella over the edge&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:27.520
this is witnessed by everyone just as police&nbsp;
arrive and the baroness is unable to cover&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:33.680
it up luckily estella prepared for this&nbsp;
and she uses a parachute to stop her fall&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:39.840
as the baroness is being arrested cruella&nbsp;
arrives once again surprising everyone estella&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:44.560
through narration reveals that she bequeathed&nbsp;
her will to cruella knowing that baroness would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:49.360
try to kill her which now leaves her with&nbsp;
her mother's fortune cruella holds a funeral&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:55.840
for estella then takes horus and jasper plus&nbsp;
buddy wink and the newly adopted dalmatians&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:55.840 --> 00:12:01.200
back to the estate which she renames hell hall&nbsp;
after taking the man out of helman together&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:06.640
with john and artie as part of the team cruella&nbsp;
tells the brothers that she has some big plans in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:13.120
