00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.760
the premise of the movie is set in 2067 when the&nbsp;
world has been destroyed beyond rehabilitation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:11.360
because of climate change all plant life has&nbsp;
been extinct with a lack of plant life the amount&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:18.160
of oxygen in the air has decreased exponentially&nbsp;
people have to buy artificial oxygen to survive 99&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.760
of the world has gone dark people suffocate&nbsp;
to death in such conditions only one city in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.400
australia has survived and it is all thanks to a&nbsp;
company called the chrono corp corporation that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:34.240
manufactures synthetic oxygen however artificial&nbsp;
oxygen causes a fatal disease called the sickness&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:40.080
over time humankind has mere years before it&nbsp;
goes fully extinct ethan white is a resident&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:45.760
of the australian city he and his friend jude&nbsp;
work as mechanics in the chronicler corporation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.160
the corporation is also working day and night&nbsp;
to find a cure for the sickness and a way to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:56.480
save the world ethan's wife xanthe also has the&nbsp;
sickness ethan works hard day and night to earn&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:02.720
and buy her better oxygen one day as ethan and&nbsp;
jude work in the tunnel the chronic orb cto of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:08.640
particle research regina jackson summons them&nbsp;
to her office there she introduces herself to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.280
the two and tells them that humanity is going to&nbsp;
die in a few years if the conditions do not change&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.240
she then reveals that ethan is the only&nbsp;
one who can help everyone and save humanity&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.080
ethan is confused and doesn't believe her but&nbsp;
regina insists he visit their lab the lab has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.680
huge machinery the lab doctor named billy mitchell&nbsp;
introduces himself to ethan and looks at ethan's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.640
wrist device for a second they then explained&nbsp;
to him that ethan's father dr richard white&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.360
started this project 20 years ago the machine&nbsp;
that stands in front of them is a time machine&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.480
called the chronicle in the first ever experiment&nbsp;
done with the machine they had to send radio waves&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:51.520
into it to check what was on the other side they&nbsp;
found out through it that 407 years later in 2474&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.920
the earth would have enough vegetation to maintain&nbsp;
enough oxygen in the air and sustain human life&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.480
the people come to believe that if humanity&nbsp;
still exists several hundred years later&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.400
it is likely that they have found solutions&nbsp;
to all the problems plaguing their reality&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.640
however a strange activity baffled the scientists&nbsp;
there the waves they sent had come back reformed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.600
when they decoded it they found out that someone&nbsp;
from the future had sent them the message saying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.720
send ethan white so now regina and the whole&nbsp;
team want to send ethan into the future for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.760
him to bring back the cure ethan is beyond&nbsp;
surprised he doesn't believe them and thinks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.480
that regina is just bluffing moreover he doesn't&nbsp;
want to leave his sick wife and go into the future&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:37.760
so he declines to help later ethan and jude are at&nbsp;
a diner where they buy crisp oxygen jude tries to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:43.280
persuade ethan to go through with the plan and&nbsp;
help save humanity however ethan laughs at him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.840
saying that he doesn't want to be like his father&nbsp;
ethan hates his father for never being there for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.640
him twenty years ago his father left home and&nbsp;
went missing while his mother was killed when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:58.160
he was a kid since then he has been brought up by&nbsp;
jude who he regards as his older brother as well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:03.040
as best friend he blames his father for leaving&nbsp;
his mother to complete the project and doesn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.160
want to follow in his path and leave his sick wife&nbsp;
however jude manages to persuade him saying that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:13.200
the only way he can save his wife is by finding&nbsp;
a cure ethan reminisces of his eighth birthday&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:18.640
when his father has bought him a strange box as a&nbsp;
gift as he puts his hands inside the box a device&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.920
latches onto his wrist making him bleed richard&nbsp;
had placed a permanent hand device on his son&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.760
it has been many years but ethan doesn't know&nbsp;
its use yet later at home ethan tells xanthe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:35.120
everything that happened during the day and she&nbsp;
too insists him to go the following morning ethan&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:40.960
scribes i will find my way back to you on a metal&nbsp;
flower and leaves it beside xanthe he then goes to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:45.600
regina's office again and tells her that if he can&nbsp;
find only one cure they will have to give it first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:51.280
to xanthe regina accepts and takes him to the&nbsp;
lab again dr mitchell shows him the suit that he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.160
has to wear before getting into the machine as&nbsp;
they begin to explain the mission to him ethan&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:01.200
realizes that they do not have a plan they have&nbsp;
no clue what he will see or who he will meet at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:06.880
the other end however after they put him in the&nbsp;
suit they give him an ai device called the archie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:12.160
archie will show the lab ethan's vitals at all&nbsp;
times it will also help to navigate his location&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:18.400
then they finally throw him into the machine&nbsp;
inside ethan moves at high speed through time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:23.680
he falls from the sky and lands in an unknown&nbsp;
jungle the friction from the air causes his suit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:29.040
to catch fire so he quickly gets out of it then&nbsp;
he looks around and is astounded by the beauty&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:34.880
of nature he finds that the world has completely&nbsp;
changed the trees and the natural oxygen are back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.680
he walks in the direction archie directs&nbsp;
him and sees a bunker door of some sort&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.800
but what catches his eyes is a skeleton that lies&nbsp;
right in front of the door its skull has a bullet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:50.400
hole in it furthermore he looks at the name tag&nbsp;
on it and is horrified to see his own name the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:56.240
skeleton is ethan's ethan also finds the skeletons&nbsp;
archie and plays the last recording on it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:02.480
he hears a man say that this is the only way and&nbsp;
shoots ethan just then the device's power goes off&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:07.680
he is horrified believing that this is the fate&nbsp;
that awaits him then he notices the skeleton's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:13.040
wrist device it is identical to ethan's except&nbsp;
the light glows green in the skeletons device&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:18.640
but ethan's has been red his whole life that night&nbsp;
he lights a fire and eats wild berries it turns&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:24.320
out that the berries were poisonous ethan vomits&nbsp;
and starts to go unconscious ethan wakes up after&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:29.760
a while and is surprised to see jude in front of&nbsp;
him as it turns out the lab saw ethan's vitals&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:35.120
dropping and assumed he was having a reaction to&nbsp;
poison so they quickly sent jude to the future&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:40.960
with the cure to save him sometime later ethan and&nbsp;
jude find that his skeleton remains there which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:46.880
means his fate hasn't changed they then use archie&nbsp;
to find another door some device scans ethan's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:52.960
eye and grants them access when they go in a&nbsp;
monitor welcomes him it asks him for a dna sample&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:59.040
when he accepts it his wrist device begins to&nbsp;
work making him bleed after the blood test it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:04.160
goes green the lights to the room turn on and&nbsp;
they realize that they are in chronocorp's lab&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:10.160
407 years later the time machine is in front of&nbsp;
them too jude gets excited because now they have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:14.960
the means to go back to the past but ethan doesn't&nbsp;
think so saying they haven't changed anything and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:20.480
he will end up dead just like the dead ethan ethan&nbsp;
checks the system log and finds a holographic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:25.040
recording made by his father who explains that the&nbsp;
time machine was originally designed to collect&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:30.160
the oxygen data in the future planet and then&nbsp;
transmit it back to the past however when his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:35.280
father first started the time machine he received&nbsp;
a message asking him to send his son to the future&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:40.080
despite his misgivings he chose to do so&nbsp;
and made a dna verification here for ethan&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:45.360
soon ethan and jude realized that the time machine&nbsp;
won't be able to take them back because its&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:51.040
battery has almost depleted after 407 years what's&nbsp;
worse is that the activation of the lab triggers a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:56.080
malfunction in its nuclear power core threatening&nbsp;
to unleash a nuclear explosion in just four hours&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:01.040
this means they have to find a way to fix the&nbsp;
time machine and travel back before the explosion&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:06.560
running out of time they have to act quickly&nbsp;
outside they are surprised to find a ruined&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:11.600
city covered with green plants but inhabited with&nbsp;
no humans showing that earth starts to recover&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:17.200
itself after human extinction human skeletons&nbsp;
are scattered everywhere ethan gets to his wife's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:22.400
house only to find her bones making him fall&nbsp;
into despair jude tries to persuade him to go&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:27.120
back to the past as the cure against the sickness&nbsp;
doesn't seem to exist even in the future world&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:33.280
however jude's words make ethan suspicious he then&nbsp;
turns on the rusty archie to play the recording&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:38.480
once again from which he recognizes jude's voice&nbsp;
and it seems jude is exactly the one who shot him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:44.480
jude raises his gun at ethan strongly denying&nbsp;
that he would shoot ethan ethan finally decides to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:48.960
complete the mission first so with joint efforts&nbsp;
they managed to repair the power core and then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:53.600
return to the lab now the chronicle system works&nbsp;
and they should be able to return to the past&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:58.880
they just need to wait 37 minutes till portal&nbsp;
launch once the countdown reaches zero the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:05.520
portal will tether to 2067 for approximately 30&nbsp;
seconds however ethan still finds his body remains&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:10.000
behind a door at the same location which implies&nbsp;
that they haven't made any changes to the future&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:14.800
in order to figure out the truth ethan pulls&nbsp;
out the battery of his current archie and puts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:20.080
it onto the rusty one in that way he gets&nbsp;
access to another video in which ethan is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:24.640
assured that his future self will be killed&nbsp;
by jude jude then confesses that there is no&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:29.760
hope of changing the future and he is trying to&nbsp;
protect ethan finding it hard to believe ethan&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:34.480
locks his brother up in a room then plays back&nbsp;
his father's holographic log from the day he died&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:40.800
he soon discovers a conversation between the&nbsp;
chronic corpse cto regina jackson and his father&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:45.440
it's shown that ethan's father wanted to use the&nbsp;
time machine to save all mankind by finding the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:50.640
cure but the cto only intended to use the machine&nbsp;
to flee from the dying time with some chosen few&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:55.760
however whichever plan they choose someone must&nbsp;
travel into the future and turn on the time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:55.760 --> 00:09:00.880
machine to safely send living matter through time&nbsp;
it requires an operational link from both sides&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:06.960
in order to stop the cto with her plan his father&nbsp;
locks the time machine and sets ethan's dna as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:12.400
the verification key in anger at what ethan's&nbsp;
father just did the cto killed him immediately&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:17.360
she then orders jude to kill ethan's mother and&nbsp;
be a guardian to him so one day they can use&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:22.720
ethan's wristband to get access to the future&nbsp;
ethan is beyond surprised the man he thought&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:26.800
of as his brother turned out to be the one who&nbsp;
killed his mother and is about to kill him too&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:32.160
he also realizes that he has misunderstood his&nbsp;
father who didn't deliberately abandon the family&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:37.440
knowing that regina wants to bring a chosen few&nbsp;
into the future ethan tries to shut the time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:42.640
machine down but jude rushes to stop ethan and&nbsp;
reveals that he's tasked here by the cto to ensure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:48.160
that ethan is sent in time to repair the power&nbsp;
failure once ethan activates the time machine he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:53.520
should kill ethan however jude has formed close&nbsp;
emotional relations with ethan over the years&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:57.520
seeing his brother-like friend in that&nbsp;
state because of him he is guilt-ridden&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:03.920
so instead of shooting ethan he shoots himself&nbsp;
dead in rage and regret ethan is determined&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:09.200
to fulfill his father's dying wish which is to&nbsp;
find the cure and save the dying humans he looks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:14.480
into the monitor and finds the very first message&nbsp;
written by his father he deduces that the message&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:19.520
sent ethan white was sent by himself hence he&nbsp;
codes in the message again and sends it into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:25.840
the past along with many other things meanwhile&nbsp;
in the laboratory of the year 2067 the cto with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:30.160
a group of privileged chosen people are waiting&nbsp;
anxiously for the time machine to be activated&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:36.240
to their shock however the time machine sends back&nbsp;
hundreds of extinct plants along with a copy of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:41.840
the recorded murder of ethan's father soon after&nbsp;
the time machine is destroyed by ethan resulting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:48.000
in the collapse of the cto's plan in the end the&nbsp;
cto is arrested due to the murder the plants sent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.840
back to 2067 are cultivated to revitalize the&nbsp;
planet ethan's wife also receives a flower sent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:58.960
from him and understands his choice while ethan&nbsp;
has to stay in the future world alone he buries&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:04.240
jude and forgives him a butterfly catches his&nbsp;
attention and leads him again to the same entrance&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:09.120
where ethan is happy to notice that the corpse of&nbsp;
his future self is gone he rushes to take a look&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:14.240
at the world outside and feels relieved to see a&nbsp;
futuristic eco-friendly city in contrast to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:20.560
deserted one from earlier his decision had changed&nbsp;
