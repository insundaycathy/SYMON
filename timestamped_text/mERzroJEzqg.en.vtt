00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:14.320
Following the events of the previous film&nbsp;
Casino Royale, James Bond is driving to Siena,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:20.080
Italy, with the captured Mr. White in&nbsp;
the trunk of his Aston Martin DBS V12.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:26.960
After evading pursuers, Bond delivers White to M,&nbsp;
the chief of MI6, who interrogates him regarding&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:32.240
the mysterious organisation, Quantum. When White&nbsp;
responds that their operatives are everywhere,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.840
M's bodyguard Craig Mitchell suddenly&nbsp;
shoots one of the guards and attacks M.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:43.280
Bond chases Mitchell and eventually kills him;&nbsp;
White escapes in the confusion. After returning&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:49.040
to London, and searching Mitchell's flat, Bond&nbsp;
and M discover Mitchell had a contact in Haiti,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:55.680
Edmund Slate. Bond learns Slate is a hitman sent&nbsp;
to kill Camille Montes at the behest of her lover,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:02.080
environmentalist entrepreneur Dominic Greene,&nbsp;
who is helping exiled Bolivian General Medrano,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.880
who murdered Camille's family, to overthrow&nbsp;
the government and become the new president,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.680
in exchange for a seemingly&nbsp;
barren piece of desert.&nbsp;

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.800
After rescuing Camille from Medrano, Bond&nbsp;
follows Greene to Austria. Meanwhile,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:20.720
the head of the CIA's South American section,&nbsp;
Gregg Beam, along with agent Felix Leiter, strike&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:26.160
a noninterference deal with Greene for access to&nbsp;
putative stocks of Bolivian oil, which the CIA&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.880
believes to be the reason for Greene's interest&nbsp;
in the land. Bond infiltrates Quantum's meeting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:36.800
at the opera, identifying members of Quantum's&nbsp;
executive board, and a gunfight ensues. A Special&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:42.480
Branch bodyguard working for Quantum member Guy&nbsp;
Haines, an advisor to the British Prime Minister,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:48.320
is killed by one of Greene's men after Bond throws&nbsp;
him off a roof. Assuming Bond killed him, M has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:54.640
his passports and credit cards revoked. Bond heads&nbsp;
to Talamone and convinces his old ally RenÃ© Mathis&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.720
(whose innocence was confirmed after the events&nbsp;
of Casino Royale) to accompany him to Bolivia.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:02.000
They are greeted by Fields, a consular employee&nbsp;
who demands Bond return to the UK immediately.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.520
Bond seduces her, and they attend a fundraising&nbsp;
party Greene holds that night. At the party,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.720
Bond again rescues Camille from Greene and they&nbsp;
leave. The Bolivian police pull Bond and Camille&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.600
over but discover Mathis unconscious in the car's&nbsp;
boot. One of the policemen shoots Mathis before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:23.280
Bond kills both of them. Mathis dies in Bond's&nbsp;
arms, urging him to forgive Vesper and himself.&nbsp;

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.480
The following day, Bond and Camille survey&nbsp;
Quantum's intended land acquisition by air;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.280
their plane is damaged by Bolivian fighter planes.&nbsp;
They trick the planes into destroying themselves,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.000
skydive into a sinkhole and discover that,&nbsp;
instead of finding oil, Quantum has been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.640
secretly damming Bolivia's supply of fresh&nbsp;
water to create a monopoly. Back in La Paz,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:48.160
Bond meets M and learns Quantum killed Fields by&nbsp;
drowning her in crude oil. Bond meets Leiter, who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.560
discloses Greene and Medrano will meet at a hotel,&nbsp;
La Perla de las Dunas, in the Atacama Desert to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.240
finalize their agreement, and warns him to escape&nbsp;
as the CIA's Special Activities Division arrives.&nbsp;

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.720
Bond and Camille infiltrate the hotel, where&nbsp;
Greene blackmails Medrano into signing a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.040
contract that will make Medrano the leader&nbsp;
of Bolivia in exchange for the land rights,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.760
making Greene Bolivia's sole water provider&nbsp;
at significantly higher rates. Bond kills&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.960
the police chief for betraying Mathis, and after&nbsp;
killing the security detail, he confronts Greene.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:22.080
Meanwhile, Camille kills Medrano, avenging the&nbsp;
murders of her family. The struggle leaves the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.880
facility destroyed by fire. Bond captures&nbsp;
Greene and interrogates him about Quantum.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.920
Bond leaves him stranded in the desert with only a&nbsp;
can of engine oil. Bond and Camille share a kiss,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.400
and she wishes him luck in conquering his demons.
Bond travels to Kazan, Russia, where he finds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.360
Vesper Lynd's former lover, Yusef Kabira,&nbsp;
a member of Quantum who seduces women&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.200
agents with valuable connections and is&nbsp;
indirectly responsible for her death.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:51.520
After saving Kabira's latest target (Katic), Bond&nbsp;
allows MI6 to arrest Kabira, unharmed. Outside,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.680
M tells Bond that Greene was found dead in&nbsp;
the middle of the desert, shot twice in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:01.120
neck and some engine oil found in his stomach. M&nbsp;
tells Bond she needs him back; he responds that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:07.520
he never left. As he walks away, Bond drops&nbsp;
Vesper's necklace behind him in the snow.
