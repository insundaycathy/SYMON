00:00:06.476 --> 00:00:07.724
hey what's up guys

00:00:07.964 --> 00:00:11.036
today I'll show you a fantasy action film: "Dororo" 

00:00:11.276 --> 00:00:14.012
spoiler ahead, watch out and take care

00:00:14.396 --> 00:00:18.044
in a Japanese winehouse, guests are drinking to their heart's content 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:19.676
while watching a dance performance

00:00:19.772 --> 00:00:24.428
all of a sudden, a man jumps onto the stage and cuts off the lead dancer's facial mask

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:25.868
when the mask is torn off

00:00:25.964 --> 00:00:29.372
everyone is shocked to discover that the dancer is a huge spider

00:00:29.564 --> 00:00:32.252
the intrusion certainly throws the guests into turmoil 

00:00:32.348 --> 00:00:35.228
and all of them evacuate the winehouse in terror 

00:00:35.468 --> 00:00:39.740
the man removes his arm and brings out a hidden blade to slash the spider

00:00:39.932 --> 00:00:44.252
the spider in turn, pierces through the man's body, but he is not injured at all 

00:00:44.348 --> 00:00:47.036
surprisingly, his wound heals in an instant

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.740
in the end, he kills the spider monster and his leg grows back from his own body

00:00:51.877 --> 00:00:54.997
this mysterious man is a rōnin named Hyakkimaru

00:00:55.237 --> 00:00:59.077
20 years ago, his father the King, made a deal with the 48 demons

00:00:59.173 --> 00:01:02.389
so as to gain prosperity and rule over his land 

00:01:02.581 --> 00:01:06.469
his deal was sealed at the expense of his firstborn son Hyakkimaru

00:01:06.613 --> 00:01:10.357
as his wife was giving birth, demons fed on each body part of the son

00:01:10.357 --> 00:01:14.650
leaving the son without skin, ears, noses, eyes, or limbs 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.029
however, with a bit of luck on his side

00:01:17.125 --> 00:01:20.293
the abandoned child was eventually found by a master medicine man 

00:01:20.485 --> 00:01:22.453
who was frantic about regeneration 

00:01:22.501 --> 00:01:26.101
so he fully applied his knowledge to healing the poor boy Hyakkimaru

00:01:26.293 --> 00:01:29.797
he first collected the remains of babies who had died in the war

00:01:29.893 --> 00:01:31.477
after a series of processing

00:01:31.573 --> 00:01:36.181
he fixed the artificial limbs and organs on Hyakkimaru to build him a new body

00:01:36.373 --> 00:01:39.925
as Hyakkimaru grew up, the master had taught him martial arts 

00:01:40.021 --> 00:01:42.757
and attached two short blades to his arms 

00:01:42.901 --> 00:01:47.269
years later, before the master passed away, he revealed Hyakkimaru's origin

00:01:47.413 --> 00:01:50.869
ever since then, Hyakkimaru has decided to hunt down the demons 

00:01:50.965 --> 00:01:53.413
so as to claim all his lost organs back

00:01:53.605 --> 00:01:58.501
whenever Hyakkimaru manages to kill a demon, he will restore one of his lost organs 

00:01:58.645 --> 00:02:01.861
since most of his physical parts are crafted by healing magic

00:02:01.957 --> 00:02:04.597
Hyakkimaru is invincible to any mortal blow

00:02:04.837 --> 00:02:07.525
on the same day after Hyakkimaru defeats the spider

00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:10.837
he runs into Dororo, a young orphaned female thief 

00:02:11.077 --> 00:02:14.629
Dororo has heard of Hyakkimaru's story through a kungfu musician 

00:02:14.773 --> 00:02:18.901
in fact, the two blades hidden in his arms are gifted by the musician 

00:02:18.997 --> 00:02:23.989
fascinated by the legend, Dororo has made up her mind to follow him in the hunt for demons 

00:02:24.133 --> 00:02:29.941
Hyakkimaru however, prefers to be alone, so he repeatedly warns Dororo not to glue to him

00:02:30.085 --> 00:02:35.797
to his dismay, no matter how he drives Dororo away, she insists to remain by his side 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:39.685
on the way, an ugly giant fat baby appears before them out of nowhere

00:02:39.733 --> 00:02:41.797
and leads them to a nunnery nearby 

00:02:42.085 --> 00:02:46.213
it turns out the giant fat baby is formed by spirits of multiple dead babies 

00:02:46.405 --> 00:02:50.053
while Hyakkimaru and Dororo are taking a short break in the nunnery

00:02:50.197 --> 00:02:52.309
a couple have come to visit the place 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:55.525
in a world where war has ravaged every village in the area 

00:02:55.669 --> 00:02:58.933
and famine, sickness, and natural disaster have become the norm

00:02:59.077 --> 00:03:02.389
many parents struggling to make their ends meet have no choice 

00:03:02.485 --> 00:03:04.309
but send their children to the nunnery 

00:03:04.405 --> 00:03:06.661
however, no one expects that one day 

00:03:06.757 --> 00:03:09.925
a tragic fire would take away the lives of all the nuns and children

00:03:10.117 --> 00:03:15.109
so the parents often visit the nunnery to offer their condolences and ask for forgiveness

00:03:15.205 --> 00:03:20.197
hearing their confession, Dororo criticizes the selfish parents for abandoning their children

00:03:20.293 --> 00:03:23.797
but actually, poverty rules out other choices for them  

00:03:23.893 --> 00:03:28.981
as Hyakkimaru and Dororo continue with their journey, they meet a tycoon of the village 

00:03:29.125 --> 00:03:33.973
when the tycoon learns that they are travelers, he generously invites them for a stayover

00:03:34.021 --> 00:03:37.525
Dororo looks forward to stealing some treasures from the rich man 

00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:39.925
so she accepts the invitation right away 

00:03:40.165 --> 00:03:45.301
one thing amazing is that the tycoon has ten daughters who look identical from head to toe

00:03:45.541 --> 00:03:49.621
that night, Hyakkimaru and Dororo are getting ready to rest after meals

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:52.981
not knowing that some dark and scary secrets are awaiting them 

00:03:53.125 --> 00:03:57.013
actually, the ten daughters are not human beings but man-eating worms

00:03:57.061 --> 00:04:00.661
right now, the worms are discussing which guest they should consume first 

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:05.029
shortly after, they wriggle to the guest room, prepared to start their feast 

00:04:05.221 --> 00:04:08.965
Hyakkimaru is so alert that he kills all the beasts in a flash 

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:12.517
when Dororo wakes up, the ten monsters all have died 

00:04:12.661 --> 00:04:17.461
at this time, the giant fat baby pops up in the court and points in a certain direction

00:04:17.653 --> 00:04:21.205
Dororo and Hyakkimaru follow his instruction to a study room 

00:04:21.301 --> 00:04:23.509
where a hidden underpass is found 

00:04:23.749 --> 00:04:27.685
walking through the underpass, they see many skeletons and remains of the dead

00:04:27.877 --> 00:04:32.389
more and more bones appear until they reach the nunnery destroyed by fire 

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:35.797
now that they realize those children did not die of fire 

00:04:35.893 --> 00:04:38.629
rather, they are eaten up by the worms of the tycoon 

00:04:38.821 --> 00:04:42.469
Hyakkimaru speculates that the tycoon's wife must be a dark witch 

00:04:42.565 --> 00:04:44.773
and her food supply just comes from the nunnery 

00:04:44.869 --> 00:04:47.749
Dororo gathers the villagers to expose the tycoon 

00:04:47.845 --> 00:04:51.157
while Hyakkimaru returns to the tycoon's house to deal with them 

00:04:51.397 --> 00:04:55.957
at first, Hyakkimaru is hoping that the couple will repent from their evil acts 

00:04:56.053 --> 00:04:58.357
but tycoon refuses to admit his wrongs 

00:04:58.549 --> 00:05:02.821
even though the tycoon loves the wife so much that he even risks his life to protect her

00:05:02.917 --> 00:05:05.557
the dark witch does not return the same favor 

00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:09.685
she tries to kill Hyakkimaru and her husband together with one deadly shot  

00:05:09.877 --> 00:05:13.429
the sword goes through the two bodies and the tycoon dies in blood 

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:16.693
Hyakkimaru comes up unscathed to tackle the witch 

00:05:16.933 --> 00:05:19.957
she transforms herself into a huge but sexy moth 

00:05:20.053 --> 00:05:22.645
with her wings studded by horrifying eyes though

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:26.437
as Hyakkimaru gains the upper hand, the witch wants to fly away 

00:05:26.533 --> 00:05:30.517
luckily, the giant fat baby arrives in time to drag the moth down 

00:05:30.613 --> 00:05:34.693
so Hyakkimaru takes the chance and steps forward to slay her immediately

00:05:34.933 --> 00:05:39.157
right after the witch dies, all the children devoured by her enter the reincarnation 

00:05:39.349 --> 00:05:41.701
and Hyakkimaru earns a new organ 

00:05:41.989 --> 00:05:46.693
sadly, the villagers who have witnessed Hyakkimaru's transformation regard him as a monster

00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:48.757
and drive them away with fear

00:05:48.901 --> 00:05:51.061
having gone through the ups and downs together

00:05:51.157 --> 00:05:54.277
the two have forged comradeship to fight whoever blocks their way 

00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:57.157
the first enemy they are faced is the peach monster 

00:05:57.397 --> 00:06:00.997
the monster has a head like that of a man and a body consisting of roots

00:06:01.189 --> 00:06:05.029
once its mouth drops open, peach flowers are scattered everywhere 

00:06:05.269 --> 00:06:10.261
Dororo cannot do anything to such a monster except staying aside to enjoy the battle view

00:06:10.453 --> 00:06:14.389
after the peach beast is wiped out, Hyakkimaru gains back his ears 

00:06:14.725 --> 00:06:17.893
soon, they are confronted by another monster Godzilla

00:06:17.989 --> 00:06:20.965
when Dororo finally manages to offer some assistance 

00:06:21.205 --> 00:06:25.669
she cuts Godzilla's throat, and in return, Hyakkimaru gets back his own throat 

00:06:25.861 --> 00:06:30.421
encouraged by the multiple victories, Hyakkimaru becomes bolder in the demon hunt

00:06:30.565 --> 00:06:34.981
as such, he easily eradicates an eagle demon and claims back his own hand

00:06:35.221 --> 00:06:39.349
when they are at the borders, Dororo tells Hyakkimaru about her own story

00:06:39.637 --> 00:06:43.093
a few years ago, her hometown was trampled down by King's army 

00:06:43.333 --> 00:06:47.125
her own father was killed in the war, and her mom was frozen to death 

00:06:47.365 --> 00:06:49.861
Dororo lives on the mission to murder King

00:06:50.245 --> 00:06:52.501
shortly after, they have entered King's land

00:06:52.693 --> 00:06:56.389
Hyakkimaru alone visits a winehouse to get some food and a break 

00:06:56.725 --> 00:06:59.509
suddenly a gang of robbers break into the wine house 

00:06:59.797 --> 00:07:01.573
while most of the guests flee the scene

00:07:01.669 --> 00:07:04.981
Hyakkimaru remains on his seat with absolute composure 

00:07:05.269 --> 00:07:08.965
one of the robbers challenges Hyakkimaru but receives a hard blow 

00:07:09.205 --> 00:07:13.573
thanks to the blow job, the Prince in the winehouse notices his excellent martial skills

00:07:13.861 --> 00:07:17.653
therefore, Prince intends to hire Hyakkimaru to work for him 

00:07:17.797 --> 00:07:21.253
out of curiosity, Hyakkimaru follows Prince to the palace 

00:07:21.349 --> 00:07:23.941
while they tour around the palace, they meet the Queen 

00:07:24.181 --> 00:07:26.677
who is shocked to see Hyakkimaru's clothes

00:07:26.773 --> 00:07:30.613
Queen recognizes that he is the very son she abandoned twenty years ago

00:07:30.757 --> 00:07:33.781
Queen cannot wait to tell Hyakkimaru their relationship 

00:07:33.877 --> 00:07:38.773
as soon as Hyakkimaru touches the Queen's hand, the past vividly replays in his mind

00:07:38.917 --> 00:07:42.037
but the fact that Queen setting him adrift breaks his heart 

00:07:42.181 --> 00:07:44.677
he has been searching for his origin all his life

00:07:44.869 --> 00:07:47.941
but the truth has thrown him into torment and confusion

00:07:48.085 --> 00:07:51.253
while Hyakkimaru immerses himself in shock and sorrow

00:07:51.349 --> 00:07:53.125
Dororo tries to comfort him

00:07:53.317 --> 00:07:57.829
however, Hyakkimaru reveals that her enemy is no one else but his own father

00:07:57.973 --> 00:08:02.581
overcome by her grief and hatred, Dororo surprises Hyakkimaru with a stab

00:08:02.725 --> 00:08:05.749
as usual, Hyakkimaru is not wounded at all 

00:08:05.941 --> 00:08:11.125
empathizing with Dororo's pains, Hyakkimaru calmly accepts whatever she says and does

00:08:11.365 --> 00:08:13.381
then the two of them part their ways 

00:08:13.477 --> 00:08:17.173
but Dororo returns to Hyakkimaru after some careful consideration 

00:08:17.365 --> 00:08:21.061
she asks Hyakkimaru to let go of his own grudges to start anew 

00:08:21.109 --> 00:08:23.605
her words have moved the heart of Hyakkimaru 

00:08:23.797 --> 00:08:26.965
on the other hand, Queen wishes to see Hyakkimaru again 

00:08:27.205 --> 00:08:29.797
but her plan is always disrupted by the Prince 

00:08:29.989 --> 00:08:33.829
to retain his existing power and privileges as the one and only prince

00:08:33.973 --> 00:08:36.277
Prince deceides to go kill Hyakkimaru

00:08:36.517 --> 00:08:40.837
Queen is heartbroken to learn of his ambition, but she can do nothing to stop him 

00:08:40.981 --> 00:08:44.725
in the meantime, the devil misleads King to think that Hyakkimaru's presence 

00:08:44.725 --> 00:08:46.741
hinders him from ruling the land 

00:08:46.933 --> 00:08:50.725
the devil adds that everything will be restored when Hyakkimaru dies 

00:08:50.965 --> 00:08:55.429
King buys all the lies from the devil and prepares to assassinate Hyakkimaru 

00:08:55.669 --> 00:09:00.229
when King is on his way, Prince and his soldiers have come to confront Hyakkimaru 

00:09:00.325 --> 00:09:05.029
previously Hyakkimaru is convinced by Dororo to forget the past and move forward

00:09:05.125 --> 00:09:06.853
but Prince initiates the fight 

00:09:06.997 --> 00:09:10.261
Hyakkimaru's conscience and kindness are holding him back 

00:09:10.357 --> 00:09:12.085
from killing any of the royal troops

00:09:12.181 --> 00:09:17.461
on the contrary, unwavering in his resolution to slain Hyakkimaru, Prince does not relent 	

00:09:17.605 --> 00:09:20.629
as such, Prince has killed his own soldier by mistake 

00:09:20.773 --> 00:09:25.381
Hyakkimaru intends to reconcile with Prince, but Prince only wants to end his life 

00:09:25.525 --> 00:09:27.541
in his attempt at self-defense

00:09:27.637 --> 00:09:30.949
Hyakkimaru accidentally leaves his blade stuck in Prince's throat 

00:09:31.237 --> 00:09:34.693
when Queen finally arrives, Prince drops dead to the ground 

00:09:34.981 --> 00:09:37.237
plunged into grief for the death of her younger son

00:09:37.333 --> 00:09:39.733
Queen plans to take Hyakkimaru's life for life 

00:09:39.781 --> 00:09:42.997
but she cannot bear the loss of two sons on the same day 

00:09:43.093 --> 00:09:46.117
before long, King also storms to the battlefield

00:09:46.357 --> 00:09:50.005
reading her husband's mind, Queen stops King from acting foolishly 

00:09:50.101 --> 00:09:52.981
because Hyakkimaru is their only remaining son now

00:09:53.221 --> 00:09:57.541
however, King shuts his ear to Queen's plea and puts her to death right away 

00:09:57.781 --> 00:10:00.757
King's brutal murder makes Hyakkimaru's blood boiling

00:10:00.949 --> 00:10:05.557
with the dying wish to avenge his mother, Hyakkimaru charges at his father in a fury

00:10:05.749 --> 00:10:09.781
even when Dororo tries to hold him back, she is knocked straight out 

00:10:09.973 --> 00:10:14.629
unleashing their wrath towards one another, the battle between the father and son starts

00:10:14.821 --> 00:10:18.133
over the years, Hyakkimaru has picked up many martial art skills

00:10:18.229 --> 00:10:20.197
so King is no match for such a samurai  

00:10:20.293 --> 00:10:24.565
but right then, Hyakkimaru doesn't have the heart to slaughter his own father

00:10:24.805 --> 00:10:28.741
at the same time, the devil comes to promise King that he will revive Prince 

00:10:28.789 --> 00:10:32.053
as long as King surrenders his body and his territory

00:10:32.245 --> 00:10:34.981
Hyakkimaru is firmly against such an evil plan

00:10:35.125 --> 00:10:37.813
for it will cause tremendous sufferings for the world 

00:10:38.005 --> 00:10:40.597
despite Hyakkimaru's warning, King takes the deal 

00:10:40.789 --> 00:10:43.573
as a result, the dead Prince is resurrected 

00:10:43.669 --> 00:10:45.733
while King is inhabited by the devil

00:10:45.829 --> 00:10:48.709
who conspires to release more demons to destroy the world 

00:10:48.901 --> 00:10:52.981
however, the devil does not expect the King to trick him inside his body

00:10:53.173 --> 00:10:55.625
realizing that his sins have piled up to heaven

00:10:55.625 --> 00:10:58.837
King wants to repay his people by exterminating the devil

00:10:58.981 --> 00:11:01.477
then King pushes the sword through his own belly 

00:11:01.573 --> 00:11:04.165
struggling to suppress the devil within himself

00:11:04.357 --> 00:11:06.949
he then asks Hyakkimaru to annihilate him 

00:11:07.045 --> 00:11:10.309
King's sacrifice creates the only chance to liquidate the devil 

00:11:10.405 --> 00:11:13.813
if the devil does not die, the world will never be at peace

00:11:14.053 --> 00:11:15.829
for the best interest of the majority

00:11:15.925 --> 00:11:19.045
Hyakkimaru reluctantly destroys King and the devil together 

00:11:19.285 --> 00:11:22.597
after the King's death, Prince has succeeded to the throne 

00:11:22.837 --> 00:11:26.821
Prince offers to make Hyakkimaru King for he is lacking in many ways

00:11:27.013 --> 00:11:28.789
but Hyakkimaru rejects him 

00:11:29.029 --> 00:11:33.541
Hyakkimaru has never aspired to be a ruler and he knows he is not a good fit 

00:11:33.685 --> 00:11:36.037
his dream now is to eliminate the demon ghouls 

00:11:36.085 --> 00:11:38.725
and reclaim all his lost parts with Dororo 

00:11:39.253 --> 00:11:41.893
