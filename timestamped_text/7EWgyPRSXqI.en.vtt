00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:03.840
"Hey i'm not afraid anymore"

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.080
Oh you better be Kevin because we BingeXpress&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.200
are about to comfort you and&nbsp;
team up with the wet bandits

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:21.040
but before we start let me highlight that this is&nbsp;
just a fun video now with that said let us have a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:27.440
look on how we could beat the Kevin in home alone&nbsp;
let me start off by saying that impersonating a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:33.920
police officer to gather intel about the household&nbsp;
you target is a pretty clever idea but in all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.920
honesty stuff like that doesn't work anymore&nbsp;
not that i've tried it's just a guess i mean&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:46.160
imagine a random person whoever he is inside&nbsp;
your house uninvited waiting for you to have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:53.200
a moment to speak that's just weird most people&nbsp;
would shoot that person so i guess 30 years ago&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:58.960
things might have been a bit different but if we&nbsp;
look at it from the perspective of our thieves&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.720
it does make sense because they are definitely&nbsp;
able to increase their upcoming heist success&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:10.800
rate by a lot that way on the other hand you also&nbsp;
take a big risk since you openly show your face&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.600
and having a gold tooth doesn't really&nbsp;
help your appearance stay low key&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.640
so to pull that up Marv might&nbsp;
have been the better choice

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:20.160
"go check it out"

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:25.600
"now?"

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:31.600
okay maybe not maybe not Marv but anyway harry&nbsp;
does generally a good job here i mean look at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:37.520
his costume it's pretty spot-on especially when we&nbsp;
compare it to the real officer we get to see later&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:43.040
in the movie and since this household is extremely&nbsp;
chaotic i mean there is no doubt that that helps&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.880
too in keeping a low profile now however chaotic&nbsp;
this place might be though it doesn't make up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.960
the following fact you see i have checked out the&nbsp;
neighbourhood of our house and found out that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:01.680
house is located in Winnetka Illinois turns out&nbsp;
the local police station is only about 800 meters&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:08.160
away from the Mcallisters so this fact alone&nbsp;
would convince me to either stay away completely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.920
or at least continue much more cautiously&nbsp;
in any way let's follow harry and Marv the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:20.000
infamous wet bandits and see where they could&nbsp;
have avoided errors and win the epic showdown&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:28.560
between them and the Kevin merry Christmas when&nbsp;
harry and Marv arrive at the house the first time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:34.480
there are several things i would have done&nbsp;
differently first of all parking this very sketchy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:40.160
looking car on the parking lot of the house you&nbsp;
want to rob is probably not the smartest thing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.920
to do i think we can all agree to that but you see&nbsp;
it isn't that simple because you also don't want&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:52.400
to park the car too far away because if you are&nbsp;
in need for a sudden escape you'll have a problem&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:58.640
so perhaps the best idea would have been to park&nbsp;
the car in proximity but not directly in front of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:04.320
the house like Marv harry and make it look like&nbsp;
a van of some sort of service company which they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:10.080
technically did i know but insufficiently in&nbsp;
my opinion what i mean is their outfits sucked&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:15.040
they didn't look like plumbers and since they&nbsp;
generally rob at night perhaps they could have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:20.080
additionally added "24 hours available" or&nbsp;
something similar onto the side of their van&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.320
furthermore i would have insisted on&nbsp;
only one of us attempting the robbery&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:33.920
while one of us stays behind and there are&nbsp;
multiple reasons for that but first and foremost&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:40.480
because police patrols are likely to happen around&nbsp;
here after all the police station isn't far away&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:46.640
it is holiday season and this is an upscale&nbsp;
neighbourhood however all of this happens&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.760
back in the early 90s so communication&nbsp;
was much more complicated than it is now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:58.240
there were not many mobile phones available back&nbsp;
then and if there were any they were so expensive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:04.560
it simply would have not been possible to afford&nbsp;
for most people and in our case here we would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:10.160
have needed at least two devices look i've done&nbsp;
some research for you guys and turns out that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:17.200
Microtech x9800 from Motorola was one of the only&nbsp;
ones available back then which would have been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:22.880
a great choice if it wasn't for the hefty price&nbsp;
tag of around three thousand dollars that's like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:29.760
a 16 inch macbook pro these days so to bridge the&nbsp;
communication gap following this strategy you may&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:36.240
use walkie-talkies instead which were already used&nbsp;
recreationally back in the early 90s but let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:42.320
talk about the reason why you clicked on this&nbsp;
video alright people for the sake of this video&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:49.200
let us forget that Kevin is just a kid alright he&nbsp;
stands for those who cannot stand for themselves&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:57.440
he is Gandalf facing the Balrok, Neo facing&nbsp;
agent smith he is Kevin the man of the house

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.520
"i'm the man of the house"

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:05.200
so our two Goovies here make&nbsp;
their way to Kevin's house&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:10.560
but before they arrive please allow me to&nbsp;
tell Marv that i like his sense of fashion&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:15.440
i really do but his Italian shoes are&nbsp;
a little out of place here it's late&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:20.240
December for god's sake how about some sturdy&nbsp;
timberlands for that extra grip and stability&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:26.160
we all know he will need it after announcing&nbsp;
themselves for whatever reason they finally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:32.800
split up which is a phenomenal idea i mean look&nbsp;
fighting Kevin is a tough battle we all know that

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:42.400
but your advantage is two versus one let's be&nbsp;
honest here guys if there were two Gandalfs versus&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:48.480
one Balrok we all would have rooted for the fire&nbsp;
demon that's just how things work and simple math&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:54.160
if you can't outsmart people you have to outnumber&nbsp;
them that's why every zombie movie has zombie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.160 --> 00:06:01.520
hordes anyway Marv just be careful tread lightly&nbsp;
it seems like harry struggles the same though so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:07.600
it might not have been the shoes although hey&nbsp;
timberlands would do the job i guarantee it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:12.720
timberland if you're watching this video&nbsp;
you know reach out seems like ice is not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:19.200
the only enemy here seriously i have never&nbsp;
seen a glowing red doorknob even in 2020&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:24.480
and by the way you don't really want to leave your&nbsp;
fingerprints on it i have seen George Clooney and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:29.600
his friends doing fancy stuff and apparently&nbsp;
you want to wear gloves when stealing things&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:34.560
burning away your fingerprints would do it too&nbsp;
well anyway let's check out Marv how is he doing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:43.520
did you know that the average iron weighs three&nbsp;
pounds now you do i researched it so you don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:50.320
have to ever again so when Marv tries to get up&nbsp;
the stairs his choice of shoes once again screws&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:57.040
him over to the point where he ends up bare foot&nbsp;
i told you this would not have happened if he wore&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:03.680
the right shoes but let's put aside their obvious&nbsp;
bad choice of fashion here and focus on their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:09.520
reaction time because that too seems to be on the&nbsp;
lower end of the spectrum and we all know by now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:15.840
that playing video games 15 hours a day is a&nbsp;
possible way to increase one's reaction time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:22.560
and since pac-man was released back in the early&nbsp;
80s the options were there simple truth harry&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:28.640
simple truth but anyway they finally make it into&nbsp;
the house harry more like a SWAT team breaking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:35.040
into a house to get that peaceful stoner well&nbsp;
congratulations harry you're in now and the next&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:42.560
trap isn't precisely the worst one i mean look so&nbsp;
far you got burned twice while Marv got hit by a 3&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:49.520
pound iron in free fall so having glue all over&nbsp;
your face while feathers are raining down on you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:54.960
is a pretty comfortable thing unless it's evil&nbsp;
super glue then well then you better go for the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.960 --> 00:08:03.040
nail polish remover straight away meanwhile Marv&nbsp;
this poor tall guy finds his way into the house&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:08.800
through the open window and i know what you guys&nbsp;
are thinking now why don't you look where you step&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:15.680
morph well look he's a tall guy okay it isn't&nbsp;
easy for us to realize what goes down on the lower&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:21.520
levels of experience so we really can't blame him&nbsp;
for that what we should feel though is empathy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:30.080
because we all know what it feels like stepping&nbsp;
barefoot on tiny evil sharp objects alright let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:36.800
assess the situation here real quick guys we are&nbsp;
finally inside we know that there are booby traps&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:43.520
all over the place so we should be a bit careful&nbsp;
the goal is the eight-year-old on the second floor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:49.760
now honestly if it was up to me i would just loot&nbsp;
the ground floor and make for an escape simple&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:55.280
and easy and since most traps were already&nbsp;
activated down here there isn't much more to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:55.280 --> 00:09:01.520
overly pay attention to but well in the movie&nbsp;
they chase Kevin regardless but i kind of get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:06.560
it it's like the boss battle you can't beat&nbsp;
but your ego doesn't allow you to back off&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:13.440
many of you will understand they just can't let go&nbsp;
i'm up here you morons so chasing Kevin upstairs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:19.760
they fall backwards on tiny cars um causing me to&nbsp;
lose my breath as well for a few moments but they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:27.600
get back up and well get hit by paint buckets yup&nbsp;
those look like they hold about 3 liters of paint&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:33.040
i'd probably prefer stepping on legos than&nbsp;
getting hit with that alright so when Marv&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:39.280
almost catches Kevin and Kevin dodges the grab&nbsp;
by putting bart's tarantula on Marv's face&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:46.640
i kind of felt sorry for the spider okay i mean&nbsp;
look what can i say i'm an animal simp animals&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:52.960
are cool and well some of them are tasty too&nbsp;
however i am more impressed with that scene though&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:58.960
because all tarantulas laws are venomous to some&nbsp;
extent so having one on your face and screaming&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:05.280
like Marv does is kind of a risky thing isn't it i&nbsp;
guess things were a bit more raw back in the early&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:12.960
90s so Kevin escapes to his tree fortress using&nbsp;
his homemade zip-line which we all agree is one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:18.480
of the coolest things ever at this point though&nbsp;
it would have been much better for our thieves&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:25.280
to stay behind and well do what they came to&nbsp;
do and if you still want to catch the Kevin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:32.000
you should have split up talking yourselves over&nbsp;
the zip-line is just a bad idea to begin with plus&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:38.640
it looks like it's very high up as well falling&nbsp;
from this height can easily result in fractures&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:44.080
not if you wear timberlands of course but they&nbsp;
were lucky they survived their fall and chased&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:50.400
Kevin to the point where they actually caught him&nbsp;
just bad that this is Kevin's hood and not theirs

00:10:56.240 --> 00:11:02.240
so what is the verdict here first of all if&nbsp;
they didn't lose their goal out of sight which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:07.120
was looting the darn place they could have&nbsp;
done so at least to some extent and escaped&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:12.320
successfully thereafter that is the first thing&nbsp;
then the second and even more important thing is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:16.000
don't underestimate anyone that bears the name&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.160
Kevin with that said my dear friends&nbsp;
i have a last message for you all

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:22.240
