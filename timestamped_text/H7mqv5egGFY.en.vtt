00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.250
Welcome Back to Movie Recaps.

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.539
Today I will show you a horror, dark comedy
film from 2017, titled Happy death day.

00:00:07.539 --> 00:00:08.690
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:10.610
Watch out and take care.

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:12.790
The campus clock chimes nine.

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:15.570
Tree wakes up in a dorm room that's not hers.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.050
Carter turns around and greets her, then her
phone rings to the sound of a birthday song.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.029
She asks where her clothes are and immediately
stands up to get dressed.

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.170
Tree asks for Tylenol and Crater scrambles
to find it.

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:31.090
When she's done dressing, he gives her the
bottle of pills, still trying to be nice to

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:34.460
her, but she tells him not to say a word about
their encounter.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.450
As she's about to leave Carter's friend walks
in asking him if he slept with her.

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.610
Tree is disgusted with both of them.

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.940
She walks outside and a goth is checking her
out, then a girl asks her to sign a petition

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.879
to stop global warming, the sprinkles come
on chasing off a kissing couple, a car alarm

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:54.640
blares, a frat guy is torturing a few rushes
and one collapses as she passes by them.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.840
Suddenly, she's stopped by Tim - her supposed
stalker, a guy she had one date with and doesn't

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:00.840
like.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.920
She makes fun of him, then leaves.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.200
She walks up to her sorority house and a girl
greets her.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.550
Tree sneaks inside, but is immediately caught
by Danielle, who reminds her about the house

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.110
meeting at lunch.

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.120
She walks inside her bedroom and is greeted
by her roommate Lori, as she drops on her

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.200
bed.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.790
As Lori recounts the previous night partying,
Tree suddenly sees the time, realizing she's

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:23.330
late for class.

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.000
She jumps out of bed, rushing to get dressed
and find her books.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.950
She turns around and Lori gives her a birthday
cupcake, telling her that she can't hide her

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:32.590
birthdate from her.

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.590
Tree blows out the candle and drops the cupcake
in the trash as she walks out.

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.100
Lori is angry.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.490
Tree walks into a class, held by a professor
she has something going on with.

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.680
That day, she has lunch with her sorority
sisters , as one of them - Becky sits down

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.810
with a high carb lunch, deemed "bad" by Danielle.

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.140
They make her leave because of it, but when
she stands up, Carter walks into her, spilling

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.360
a chocolate shake all over Tree.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.590
She doesn't want her sorority sisters to know
she knows him and pulls him to the side.

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.440
He gives her back the bracelet that she forgot
at his room.

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:08.720
Later, she goes into a hospital and declines
a call with her Dad, then walks into Lori.

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.310
She knows why Tree is there and tells her
that what she's doing can have serious consequences.

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.760
Tree walks into an office and the professor
walks inside.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.920
She instantly starts kissing him, but suddenly
his wife knocks on the door.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.300
That night, she's in her room and Danielle
comes in, wearing her top.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.300
They talk about the party they're going to
later, when there's a power shortage.

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.130
Tree is listening to her dad's message as
she walks by some jocks, going toward the

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:34.130
party.

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.660
She walks into a creepy underpass, where a
music box is playing "Happy birthday".

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.260
Tree thinks someone is joking with her, but
there's a noise behind her.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.430
There's someone in a college mascot mask,
staring at her without saying anything.

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:47.850
He disappears.

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.600
She passes through the underpass, when he
suddenly jumps out with a knife and starts

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:52.710
chasing her.

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.480
Tree stumbles and falls.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.490
He grabs her and kills her.

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:58.740
Tree wakes up in the same dorm room.

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.319
Things start playing out the same way as before.

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:05.430
She dresses, as Carter talks to her and she
asks for Tylenol, even telling him where he

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:06.510
keeps it.

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.950
He says it's like she's been there before.

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.400
Carter's friend walks in and Tree is confused.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.640
She leaves and when she exits the building,
she passes by the same goth, the petition

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.360
girl, the sprinklers, the car alarm and the
frat guys.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:24.200
She looks confused as she runs into Tim again,
but this time she asks him what day it is.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.980
It's Monday the 18th.

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.871
Tree is greeted by the same girl in front
of her sorority and runs into Danielle, who

00:03:29.871 --> 00:03:32.180
reminds her of the sorority lunch.

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.810
Lori greets her in the same way as before
when she enters the room.

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.340
Tree feels weird, but sees she's late for
class and hurries.

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.210
Lori gives her the cupcake, but she gets more
confused and rushes out.

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:47.430
Later, she's at lunch, when the same scenario
with Becky plays out.

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.480
Tree tries to warn her about Carter, but they
still run into each other.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.990
Carter walks away, but she reminds him to
give her the bracelet back.

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:59.260
Later, she's in the professors office, wanting
to talk to him, but he kisses her and his

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.090
wife knocks on the door.

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:06.190
That night, she's watching a birthday video
of her and her mom, when Danielle walks in.

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.360
Tree is freaked out about the black out.

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.849
She walks down the same road going toward
the underpass, but when she gets there and

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:15.280
hears the music box, she takes another way
to the party.

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.300
Tree reaches the house and it looks empty.

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:19.780
It's locked, so she bangs on the door.

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.290
A guy in the mascot mask opens and she punches
him, when the lights come on for her birthday

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:25.520
surprise.

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.350
The guy under the mask was Nick.

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.360
Later, Danielle and Tree are talking and Nick
approaches them, flirting with her to the

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:32.910
dismay of Danielle.

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:35.650
Regardless, she follows him to his room.

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.570
When she walks inside, the room looks empty.

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:42.500
She checks herself out in the mirror, when
Nick shows up behind her again and she takes

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:43.930
off his mask.

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:48.669
He begins playing loud music and dances to
it badly, so Tree is unimpressed.

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:53.690
She texts with Danielle, as another man wearing
the mask walks into the room and kills Nick.

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:57.330
Tree can't hear anything over the loud music
and when she turns around she thinks the man

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:58.480
is Nick.

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.970
She walks toward him and he takes out the
knife.

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:05.710
They struggle on the bed and a frat boy walks
in, but doesn't react to what's happening.

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:07.810
The masked man stabs her.

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:11.550
Tree wakes up in the dorm room, screaming
and scaring Carter.

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:16.570
She dresses in a panic and runs out, as everything
keeps playing out the same: goth, petition

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:21.060
girl, sprinklers, car alarm, frat guys and
eventually Tim.

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:25.020
Lori greets her the same way when she enters
their room and sits down on the bed.

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.860
Tree tells Lori that she feels like she's
loosing her mind and tries to explain to her

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:32.650
that she's lived through the same day twice
As proof, she mentions the cupcake and the

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:34.100
surprise party.

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:36.200
Lori doesn't believe her story.

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:40.190
Tree tells her that somebody will kill her
that night and starts panicking, scaring Lori

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:41.190
too.

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:45.350
But, she tells her to get some rest, considering
the day is stressful for her because of her

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:46.350
mom.

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:50.919
Later, Tree is seen reinforcing her windows
and pushing a drawer in front of her door.

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:54.820
She sees a picture of her and her mom, when
suddenly Danielle knocks on her door and there's

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:56.430
a power shortage.

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:00.900
Tree sits on her bed and goes to eat the cupcake,
when she starts looking for the remote.

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:05.880
She finds a birthday card and the TV suddenly
goes off, then on again showing the news briefly,

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:07.220
than off again.

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:11.120
She hears a noise in the closet and grabs
a hammer, but when she opens it, no one's

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.120
there.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:15.750
She goes to check the bathroom, but before
she can check behind the shower curtain, the

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:17.470
TV comes on again.

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:22.080
The masked man appears behind her and after
a brief struggle, kills her, again.

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.460
Tree wakes up screaming in the dorm room,
scaring Carter.

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:27.660
She freaks out and runs off.

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:33.790
Everything is the same again: goth, petition
girl, sprinklers, car alarm, frat guys...

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:38.650
She starts spiraling into panic, when suddenly
Carter stops her to give her her stuff back.

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:40.780
She hugs him and asks him to help her.

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:44.850
Next, they're sitting in the college cantina
and Carter is trying to wrap his head around

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:46.580
what's been happening to her.

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:49.360
Her phone rings and he realizes it's her birthday.

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:53.050
He tells her that whoever's killing her knows
it's her birthday and starts making a list

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:55.190
with whomever would have motive for that.

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:58.400
He also tells her that they didn't sleep together
the previous night.

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:02.210
They continue talking about her murderer and
he tells her that she has an unlimited amount

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:04.780
of time to figure out who's killing her.

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:08.830
That night, Tree makes a suspect list and
the first one on it is Tim.

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:12.420
She peeps through his window and realizes
that he's actually gay.

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:15.200
Tree turns around and the masked man stabs
her.

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:18.630
Tree wakes up in Carters dorm room and throws
her phone in the trash.

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:22.710
Next, she's seen coloring and cutting her
hair and later she adds another name to the

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:24.930
list, the professors wife.

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:29.280
She stalks her from the bushes, but when she
turns around, the masked man tackles her and

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:30.360
kills her.

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:31.520
She wakes up.

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:33.889
The next name on her list is Danielle.

00:07:33.889 --> 00:07:37.330
They're seen talking, then fighting, when
a bus hits them.

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:38.850
She wakes up angry!

00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:42.290
Crosses Danielle of the list and the next
one is the professor.

00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:46.810
Tree walks out of the dorm room naked, all
the people she saw beforeare ogling her.

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:51.830
Later, she's waiting for her killer with a
baseball bat, but knocks Becky out by mistake.

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:55.690
When she goes to help her, the masked man
shows up and hits her with the bat.

00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:58.530
She wakes up in Carters dorm telling him his
plan sucked.

00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:02.400
She's getting weird pains in her abdomen and
as Carter's friend opens the door she faints

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:03.780
in his arms.

00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:07.420
Later, she's in a hospital and Carter walks
inside her room.

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:10.699
He tells her it's Monday the 18th and the
power shortage happens.

00:08:10.699 --> 00:08:14.009
Suddenly, the professor is standing next to
Carter.

00:08:14.009 --> 00:08:15.580
He tells him to leave.

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:19.900
The professor, who's also her doctor, shows
her an ex-ray of her lungs.

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:23.240
She has so many lesions on them, that she
should be dead.

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:26.460
Tree wants to leave, but he tells her that
she's safe there.

00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:30.210
She asks him for a soda to get him out of
the room and when he gets back she's no longer

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:31.210
there.

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:35.020
Tree runs through the hospital and goes into
the professors office, looking for his car

00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:36.020
keys.

00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:39.050
Suddenly, she finds a mask inside a drawer.

00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:42.889
She thinks he's the killer, so she carefully
walks through the hospital, when he shows

00:08:42.889 --> 00:08:46.300
up behind her and is instantly stabbed by
the masked man.

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:49.250
He goes after her and chases her to the parking
lot.

00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:53.079
Tree keeps hiding from him there, but when
she opens the professors car he hears her

00:08:53.079 --> 00:08:54.660
and catches up to her.

00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:59.269
She escapes him for the first time and rejoices,
when a cop car signals her to stop.

00:08:59.269 --> 00:09:03.529
The cop comes over her car and she tries to
explain what's happening, but realizes that

00:09:03.529 --> 00:09:07.370
if the cop thinks she's under the influence
of any illegal substance he'll have to arrest

00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:10.450
her and take her to jail, where she should
be safe.

00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:12.790
So she lies to him and he arrests her.

00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:17.529
He places her safely in the back of his patrol,
but suddenly gets hit by another car.

00:09:17.529 --> 00:09:21.259
The masked man walks out of the other car
and comes over to the patrol.

00:09:21.259 --> 00:09:25.050
Tree taunts him for a moment, but he walks
off and gets back in the car.

00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:29.860
He opens a window and drops a birthday candle,
lighting the gasoline trail to the cop car.

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:34.699
Tree wakes up in the dorm again, takes Tylenol
by herself, opens the door for Carter's friend

00:09:34.699 --> 00:09:36.399
and sends him away.

00:09:36.399 --> 00:09:40.100
She's getting dressed and Carter asks her
why she was screaming in her sleep.

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:42.950
He follows her out, wanting to know her story.

00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:46.639
She tells him that she's relieving the same
day and tells him about the sprinklers, the

00:09:46.639 --> 00:09:48.649
car alarm and the frat guy fainting.

00:09:48.649 --> 00:09:51.339
Later, they're seen in a diner eating.

00:09:51.339 --> 00:09:54.249
She burps and farts, saying he won't remember
it.

00:09:54.249 --> 00:09:58.379
Her phone rings and he asks why she doesn't
pick up when her father is calling.

00:09:58.379 --> 00:10:02.600
She tells him that her mother died 3 years
ago and that they shared the same birthday.

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:06.129
Tree is convinced that if her mom was still
alive, she wouldn't have been very proud of

00:10:06.129 --> 00:10:08.649
her, bacause she's not a good person.

00:10:08.649 --> 00:10:12.819
He tells her that her current situation makes
it easier for her to become a better person,

00:10:12.819 --> 00:10:16.529
but she doesn't think she has many more days
left, because she keeps getting weaker every

00:10:16.529 --> 00:10:17.980
time she comes back.

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:20.440
Tree's attention gets shifted to the news.

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:23.519
There's a report about a serial killer that's
in the hospital.

00:10:23.519 --> 00:10:25.319
She thinks that he's her killer.

00:10:25.319 --> 00:10:28.959
She arrives at the hospital where he's kept
and tells the nurse to call the police because

00:10:28.959 --> 00:10:30.320
he'll escape.

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:34.350
When she doesn't see an officer in front of
his door, she grabs an axe and walks inside

00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:35.459
his room.

00:10:35.459 --> 00:10:39.329
The masked man is inside too, but she doesn't
see him immediately.

00:10:39.329 --> 00:10:43.140
She sees the guard dead on the floor, when
the masked man shoots at her.

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:46.529
Tree escapes, but he kills the nurse and chases
after her.

00:10:46.529 --> 00:10:50.619
When he catches up to her, he takes of his
mask to reveal the serial killer.

00:10:50.619 --> 00:10:54.129
He raises his gun to shoot, but suddenly Crater
jumps him.

00:10:54.129 --> 00:10:57.709
Tree gets the gun and wants to shoot him,
when it jams and the serial killer breaks

00:10:57.709 --> 00:10:59.059
Carter's neck.

00:10:59.059 --> 00:11:02.050
He chases Tree again and they reach the bell
tower.

00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:05.889
She appears behind him and hits him over the
head, though she suddenly realizes that if

00:11:05.889 --> 00:11:09.249
she kills him and doesn't reset the day Carter
will be dead forever.

00:11:09.249 --> 00:11:12.369
So, she drops the crowbar and runs again.

00:11:12.369 --> 00:11:15.949
The killer goes after her, but she kills herself
instead.

00:11:15.949 --> 00:11:18.129
The campus clock chimes nine.

00:11:18.129 --> 00:11:22.509
Tree wakes up in Carter's room and hugs him,
thanking him for saving her life.

00:11:22.509 --> 00:11:26.879
Before she leaves, she grabs his pillow, spanks
his friend for being a misogynist and walks

00:11:26.879 --> 00:11:28.480
out of the building happy.

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:33.389
She sees the goth and takes his glasses, signs
the petition, tells the couple about the sprinkles

00:11:33.389 --> 00:11:37.019
and puts a pillow on the ground before the
frat boy falls down.

00:11:37.019 --> 00:11:40.399
Tree is happy to see Tim and empowers him
to get out of the closet.

00:11:40.399 --> 00:11:44.470
She finally greets the girl in front of her
sorority house and walks inside.

00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:48.689
Danielle walks up to her and she tells her
about Carter, leaving her speechless.

00:11:48.689 --> 00:11:52.510
She walks into her bedroom and apologizes
to Lori for being selfish.

00:11:52.510 --> 00:11:56.529
Next, she goes to class and calls the professor
out for a word.

00:11:56.529 --> 00:11:59.549
Tree puts an end to their relationship, dropping
his class too.

00:11:59.549 --> 00:12:04.639
During the sorority lunch, Tree isn't there
and Becky sits down with her "bad" lunch.

00:12:04.639 --> 00:12:09.489
Tree arrives and sits down next to her with
a tray of junk food, shoving it in her face.

00:12:09.489 --> 00:12:13.509
Danielle insults Becky, so Tree walks over
to her and spills the chocolate shake all

00:12:13.509 --> 00:12:14.790
over her head.

00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:18.850
Suddenly, Carter shows up to give her the
bracelet and she kisses him, then asks him

00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:20.240
out on a date.

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:21.299
He says yes.

00:12:21.299 --> 00:12:25.329
Later, she shows up at the restaurant where
her dad is waiting for her to have a birthday

00:12:25.329 --> 00:12:26.819
lunch together.

00:12:26.819 --> 00:12:30.579
Tree wants them to be open about her mom's
death and talk about her more, because she

00:12:30.579 --> 00:12:32.839
wants to stop avoiding what happened.

00:12:32.839 --> 00:12:35.549
She apologizes for hurting him by doing that.

00:12:35.549 --> 00:12:38.329
That night, she gets prepared to face her
killer.

00:12:38.329 --> 00:12:40.579
She goes to the hospital and takes the guard's
gun.

00:12:40.579 --> 00:12:45.040
Holding him at gunpoint she tells the guard
to get help because the serial killer will

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:46.040
escape.

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:49.619
Tree goes over to the sleeping prisoner, seeing
that he's restrained, telling him to open

00:12:49.619 --> 00:12:50.819
his eyes.

00:12:50.819 --> 00:12:53.899
She wants to shoot, but the safety on the
gun is on.

00:12:53.899 --> 00:12:56.760
He hits her with his pillow, grabs her and
takes her knife.

00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:58.679
They fight, but he's stronger.

00:12:58.679 --> 00:13:02.089
He gets the knife to kill her, but the alarm
on her watch rings.

00:13:02.089 --> 00:13:05.069
The power goes out and she's behind him with
the gun.

00:13:05.069 --> 00:13:06.920
Tree shoots her killer dead.

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:10.661
That night, she lights the birthday candle
on her cupcake, while her and Carter talk

00:13:10.661 --> 00:13:12.259
about what happened.

00:13:12.259 --> 00:13:15.560
Before she blows out the candle, she wishes
for "tomorrow".

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:17.720
The campus clock chimes nine.

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:19.810
Tree wakes up in Carter's room.

00:13:19.810 --> 00:13:21.549
It's the same day again.

00:13:21.549 --> 00:13:23.499
She freaks out and runs away.

00:13:23.499 --> 00:13:26.149
She bursts into her bedroom and starts packing.

00:13:26.149 --> 00:13:30.230
Lori stands up and goes to give her the cupcake,
when Tree has an epiphany.

00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:34.190
She realizes that she woke up the same day
because she died in her sleep.

00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:37.110
Tree thinks Lori killed her by poisoning the
cupcake.

00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:41.439
But when Tree kept not eating the cupcake,
Lori used the serial killer as an opportunity

00:13:41.439 --> 00:13:43.449
to kill her and get away with it.

00:13:43.449 --> 00:13:45.639
It was always Lori that killed her.

00:13:45.639 --> 00:13:49.069
Tree tells her to eat the cupcake and prove
that it wasn't her or she'll take it to the

00:13:49.069 --> 00:13:50.170
police.

00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:52.549
Lori knocks her down and locks the room.

00:13:52.549 --> 00:13:55.939
She tells her the reason for wanting to kill
her was the professor, because she was in

00:13:55.939 --> 00:13:57.119
love with him.

00:13:57.119 --> 00:14:01.040
They start fighting around the room and Lori
almost kills her, when she gets distracted

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:04.610
long enough for Tree to shove the cupcake
in her mouth and then push her out of the

00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:08.359
window, falling in front of the girl facing
the sorority house.

00:14:08.359 --> 00:14:11.059
Tree and Carter are watching the news in the
diner.

00:14:11.059 --> 00:14:13.939
Her dad calls and she picks up to calm him
down.

00:14:13.939 --> 00:14:17.799
The two of them talk and Carter starts telling
her about "Groundhog day" which she's never

00:14:17.799 --> 00:14:20.889
seen.
