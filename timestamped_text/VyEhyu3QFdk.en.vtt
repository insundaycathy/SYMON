00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.449
Hi, Mystery Recapped here.

00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:06.380
Today, I'm going to explain a horror film
called "Let Her Out."

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:07.460
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:13.790
Watch out and take care!

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.170
The film starts with a young woman who lives
at the "Gemini Motel."

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:19.210
She's a prostitute.

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.780
During a busy night, a shadowy figure approaches
her room; she is then attacked and raped by

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:25.220
the intruder.

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.360
She later discovers she is pregnant, and desperate
and alone, takes a pair of scissors to her

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.040
unborn, killing herself in the process, but
the child survives.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.040
Jumping 23 years from the incident, the film
shows Helen, who survived her pre-birth assault

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.770
from her frightened mother.

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.810
She is now a bike courier living in Toronto
with her best friend, Molly.

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:50.280
One day, Helen is tasked to deliver goods
to her friend's house named Roman.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.090
That day is Helen's birthday, so Roman gives
her a painting which he claims to be the dark

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:56.700
side of Helen.

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.730
Helen immediately takes the painting home.

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.460
At her motel, Helen recounts to Molly the
story of her mother's death.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.250
Molly cares deeply about Helen's condition.

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.000
Molly is always there to support her as Helen
doesn't have any other family.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.670
Shortly, Molly leaves the place because she
has an appointment with her boyfriend named-

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.610
Ed
As she's returning from the Motel, Helen is

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.700
struck by a car, leaving her seriously injured.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.380
Helen is then taken to the hospital.

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.900
She suffers a head injury and some broken
bones.

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.049
Weeks later, Helen is finally allowed to go
home.

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:33.810
Molly and her friends start throwing a small
party to welcome Helen's arrival.

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.050
At the party, Helen meets Ed, Molly's boyfriend,
who seems interested in her.

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:44.530
When the party is going on, suddenly Helen
begins to experience a blackout and lose consciousness.

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.979
She wakes up in an empty parking lot.

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.549
Helen is confused by what happened earlier.

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:53.780
She immediately calls Molly to ask what happened
when she was unconscious.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.310
Molly explains that Helen left the party without
telling her where she was going.

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.189
Not knowing what happened, Helen immediately
returns home in a state of anxiety.

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:07.390
At home, Helen starts to paint strange pictures,
and because she is afraid of Roman's painting,

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.029
in the end, she puts it below and covers it
with a cloth.

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:17.079
The next day, Helen starts her day as usual,
such as exercising, eating, and showering.

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:24.790
Just as she finishes taking a shower, suddenly
she starts seeing a strange figure.

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:32.650
Then, she experiences another blackout and
wakes up in front of her friends with an injured

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:33.680
foot.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.340
Molly and others are confused.

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.760
There, Molly explains to Helen that she went
out using only a towel.

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.969
For several hours, Helen had disappeared.

00:02:41.969 --> 00:02:45.389
And returning home, Helen's foot is already
bleeding.

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:49.209
Helen begins to remove the broken glass from
her feet.

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:53.560
The next day, Helen and Molly go to a doctor
named Dr. Headly to consult about what is

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.329
happening to Helen.

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:57.799
Doctor Headly begins to ask some questions.

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:02.010
Helen explains that she is always moving from
place to place unconsciously.

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.409
She was in one place, and suddenly woke up
in another.

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:07.870
This has happened frequently since the accident.

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.280
Furthermore, she frequently sees a black shadow.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.099
After hearing her explanation, the doctor
decides to perform a CT scan on her brain,

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:18.529
and the results will be out the next day.

00:03:18.529 --> 00:03:21.099
Helen immediately returns home and goes straight
to bed.

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:25.400
In her sleep, she sees fleeting visions of
a female figure.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.889
Helen wakes up to a call from Doctor Headly.

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:31.419
The doctor tells Helen that something strange
has happened to Helen's brain.

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:34.299
Hearing this, Helen immediately goes to the
hospital.

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:39.530
There, the doctor explains that they discover
a rare type of tumor in her brain.

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.480
It turns out that another person has lived
in her brain all this time.

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:48.159
Helen's mother, who earlier stabbed herself
in an attempt to end her pregnancy, it turns

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:49.669
out, was carrying twins.

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:55.019
One of the fetuses was indeed killed in utero,
but was subsequently absorbed into the skull

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:57.089
of the survivor – Helen.

00:03:57.089 --> 00:04:01.479
The car accident Helen suffered earlier somehow
"activated" this long-dormant twin who is

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:07.209
now growing at a rapid rate and is responsible
for Helen's loss of memory and erratic behavior.

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:11.549
She now suffers from a syndrome called "vanishing
twin syndrome" – an actual disorder that

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:15.969
occurs when a twin disappears in the uterus
during pregnancy as a result of a miscarriage

00:04:15.969 --> 00:04:16.969
of a twin.

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:21.000
The twin is then absorbed into the body of
the surviving fetus.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.190
This results in Helen having two different
personas, Helen and her twin sister.

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:30.560
Then, the doctor requires her to undergo surgery
to remove her twin from her brain.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.590
However, she needs to wait three days until
the surgery.

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.940
Later at home, she sees the creepy painting
given by Roman.

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.450
The painting suddenly appears on the wall.

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:44.040
She thinks that Molly was the one putting
it back, but it wasn't.

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.590
She finally decides to return the painting
to Roman.

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.940
Arriving at Roman's house, Helen sees no sign
of Roman.

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:55.500
She only sees a footage on a laptop, which
turns out to be Helen, who was torturing Roman

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.210
very sadistically.

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:00.320
The footage shows Roman begging for mercy.

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:03.450
However, unconsciously, Helen killed Roman.

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:05.740
Helen cannot remember any of those.

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:10.090
After walking around Roman's house, she also
sees broken glass, and she remembers the day

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.630
she came home with an injured foot.

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:16.810
Helen is now convinced that inside her, there
are two personas.

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:21.580
Sometimes, Helen is in control of her body,
but sometimes her twin is in control.

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:25.350
Helen now realizes she is at war with her
own body and mind.

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:29.430
She rushes back home, and begins to tie her
hands and feet to restrain her from going

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:34.191
anywhere
The next day, Helen begins to go out for a

00:05:34.191 --> 00:05:36.560
walk at night because she is bored at home.

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:41.170
However, she has hallucinations and decides
to go to a nearby toilet.

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:45.440
She starts to remove her arm cast and opens
the surgical scars on her hands.

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:51.480
She is shocked to see another human finger
in her hand.

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:57.740
Then, she decides to leave that place.

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:02.180
From behind, Molly's boyfriend, Ed, begins
to chase after Helen.

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.860
Ed is very interested in the beauty of Helen.

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:06.880
Therefore, he plans to rape her.

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:10.980
At that time, Helen's twin begins to take
control of the body.

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:13.880
She then points a knife at him, frightening
him.

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:16.990
She immediately runs back home after regaining
consciousness.

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:22.100
At home, Molly then tells Helen to stop painting
weird, scary pictures.

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:25.390
But Helen reveals that she was not the one
drawing the pictures.

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:30.060
They have a debate until finally, Helen's
body is taken over by her twin and starts

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:40.080
attacking Molly.

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:43.750
When she regains control, she realizes she
could have hurt Molly.

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:47.270
Eventually, Helen tells Molly to stay away
from her.

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:52.450
However, Molly refuses, so Helen decides to
go away from that place and stay away from

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:53.450
Molly.

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:55.160
On the way, Helen meets Ed.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:59.160
Ed wants to have revenge because Helen had
pointed a knife at him before.

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:03.450
Helen begins to explain that she was sick
and that she wasn't the one doing all that.

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:07.610
Ed doesn't listen to Helen, and he plans to
rape Helen.

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:12.110
At the same time, her twin sister starts to
take control of Helen's body and kills Ed

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:19.580
instantly.

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:24.110
After killing Ed, Helen regains her consciousness
and sees that Ed is now dead.

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:29.350
Realizing how dangerous she has become, Helen
plans to commit suicide at the Gemini Motel,

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:32.620
where her mother had committed suicide years
ago.

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:36.480
Elsewhere, Molly begins to look back at her
photos with Helen.

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:40.340
She observes a significant difference in her
before and after pictures.

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:43.030
She notices a shift in her personality as
well.

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:46.811
She finally concludes that within Helen's
body, there are two different people.

00:07:46.811 --> 00:07:50.460
And the one who attacked her was not Helen.

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:53.770
Molly immediately calls Helen to find out
where she is.

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:58.220
Helen says goodbye, revealing that she is
going to commit suicide at the Gemini Motel.

00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:03.590
Hearing this, Molly immediately uses her bike
and go straight to the motel.

00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:07.920
When Helen has just arrived at the motel and
about to commit suicide, her twin begins to

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:09.960
take control of her body.

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:11.240
Molly then arrives at the hotel.

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:13.550
However, it is too late.

00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:16.960
Her twin has completely controlled Helen's
body.

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:30.080
She immediately attacks Molly.

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:35.080
Molly tries to defend herself, and eventually,
she is forced to kill Helen.

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:40.300
In the final shot, Molly begins to walk home,
remembering all her memories with Helen.

00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:42.229
And that's how the movie ends.
