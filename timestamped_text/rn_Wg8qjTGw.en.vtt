00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.549
Hey Guys, welcome back to the channel. Today,
we will be reviewing a movie called “Thursday”.

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:09.360
It’s a movie that takes place in one single
day in the life of our main character “Casey”.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.759
Casey is a married man with a beautiful wife
in Christine. They met five years back and

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:17.991
Casey back then was a very confident man who
had strongly attracted Christine. They got

00:00:17.991 --> 00:00:22.630
into a relationship pretty fast and were really
happy. But, now, the relationship between

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.670
them wasn’t strong. They don’t have that
same love towards them. Or could we say that

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.250
the spark between them was lost.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.169
One night, Casey gets a call from his friend
who he hadn’t been in contact with for the

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:36.350
past 5 years. His friend’s name is Nick
and he had called Casey to let him know that

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.940
he was coming to his house to stay for a few
days.

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.700
Casey doesn’t feel comfortable having him
in his house, but he cannot say anything as

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.700
Nick says that he is getting married.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.260
So the next day, Casey tells Christine about
Nick coming to their house. Christine obviously

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.489
gets confused as she had never heard Casey
talk about his friend before. She questions

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.390
why he never talked about Nick before, if
he really was a good friend of his.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.239
Casey answers that before he met Christine,
he was mixed with some bad people and was

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:05.860
doing bad things himself. So, he never told
Christine about Nick as he was his friend

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.720
from that time of his life.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.690
Hearing this, Christine doesn’t say anything
as she is getting late for work. She tells

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.150
Casey that she will be late as she has a dinner
planned with her boss that night. Before leaving,

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:20.180
Christine reminds Casey that Doctor Jarvis
will be arriving today to interview him, to

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.490
see if he is fit to adopt a baby. They were
planning on adopting a baby, so it was very

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.590
important for Casey to pass this interview.
Now, Casey is all by himself in the house.

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.030
And a few hours later, his friend Nick, arrives
at his house.

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.980
Meeting after such a long time, they both
embrace each other and look really happy.

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:41.651
Nick asks Casey what he has been doing. Casey
replies that he is an architect now. Hearing

00:01:41.651 --> 00:01:46.000
his answer, Nick gets surprised. He tells
Casey that he looks boring compared to how

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.730
he used to be. Casey answers that times have
changed since he left his past job.

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:55.370
He asks Nick about his wife. Nick tells him
that she is just a girl, nothing special.

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.750
Casey gets a bit confused to hear that. He
thinks, why is Nick getting married to a girl,

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.850
who he thinks of as just “some girl”.

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.020
After a while, Nick tells Casey that he has
to go somewhere for a work related business,

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.200
and wants to borrow his car. Nick tells him
that his car had a flat tire, so he needs

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.650
Casey’s car to drive.

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.890
So, Casey hands Nick his car key and Nick
heads out. Casey goes back to work but he

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.450
can’t focus. He feels sleepy. So, he gets
out of his room and sees a briefcase in the

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.420
guest room. That briefcase belongs to Nick.
Casey is curious to know what is inside that

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.190
briefcase. He contemplates opening and seeing
it for himself to find out. But he reminds

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.740
himself, that is not a good thing to do. So,
he decides not to open the briefcase. However,

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:41.760
he quickly grabs a tool and opens the briefcase.
He calls Nick immediately and shouts at him.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.160
The briefcase contains drugs inside it. Casey
is angry at Nick for bringing drugs into his

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.690
house and possibly putting him in danger as
well. Casey wants Nick to pick up his stuff

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.060
and leave his house immediately. But Nick
replies that he cannot do so as he has important

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.340
things to deal with. So, Casey warns Nick
that if he doesn’t take his briefcase with

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.860
him, he will call the cops and hand it over
to them. But Nick isn’t afraid at all. Instead

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.490
he tells Casey that if he calls the cops,
he will tell them about his past as well.

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:10.430
After that, Nick hangs up the phone.

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.280
Casey is absolutely mad. He takes the drugs
to his kitchen. He cuts them one by one and

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.370
drains it down the pipe. Then, he hears a
doorbell and sees a pizza delivery guy. Casy

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.490
answers the door and tells him that he didn’t
order a pizza. The pizza guy then asks if

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:28.840
he can use the phone. Casey says “Okay”,
but when the pizza guy enters the house, he

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.230
punches Casey and pulls out a gun on him.

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.319
He asks Casey where the briefcase is. Casy
answers that he has already gotten rid of

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:40.041
all the drugs. Then, he calls his boss and
tells him about the drugs. After hanging up

00:03:40.041 --> 00:03:44.060
the phone, he tells Casey that regardless
of whether he got the briefcase or not, he

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:45.370
was ordered to kill him.

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.581
Casey, then as a last wish, asks him if he
can smoke. So, the man lets Casey smoke, and

00:03:50.581 --> 00:03:54.990
also tells him about himself. He tells Casey
that he aspires to be a singer and he was

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:59.480
just involved in the killing business to earn
some money before he could record an album.

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.880
Time passes by, and he and Casey have smoked
a lot of weed. He gets up and tells Casey

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.740
that it’s time for him to die. And just
when he was about to pull the trigger, he

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:11.780
gets a phone call from his friend. His friend
tells him that he has to sing a song right

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.910
now, if he wants to get a record deal. He
doesn’t want to do it right now, but seeing

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:20.329
it as a golden opportunity, he agrees. He
tells Casey to put on a cassette and then

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:25.070
he starts singing away. Casey is just confused
to see what is happening. The hitman then

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:29.570
slowly starts to get in his zone, he gets
completely lost in his singing. And then,

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:33.530
Casey sees his chance and then attacks the
hitman, and knocks him out cold.

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:38.300
He ties the hit man with duct tape and keeps
him in his garage. Casey tells him that normally,

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.930
he would just kill him. But, he is a changed
man now. So, he will not kill him, he’s

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:47.930
just confused about what to do with him. Then,
the doorbell rings again. Casey goes to check

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:52.560
and finds that it is doctor Jarvis. He is
here for the interview. Seeing him, Casey

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.320
hurries and cleans the dining table which
has weed and then sprays the room to clear

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:57.320
out the air.

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:01.630
He opens the door and the interview begins
to check if Casey is fit to adopt a baby.

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:06.090
Casey is obviously nervous to have him at
his house. Doctor Jarvis questions him about

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:10.690
a few things. Casey nervously answers his
questions but then he hears loud banging from

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:15.100
the garage. Fearing, Doctor Jarvis might find
out about the hitman, he says that he will

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:19.690
be right back and heads to the garage. Then,
Casey sees the hitman hitting on the garage

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:23.360
door. Casey has no option but to hang him
upside down.

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.610
After returning back to the interview, he
has another guest in his house. And this time,

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:32.169
it’s a pretty lady named Dallas. She tells
Casey that she is a friend of Nick. Casey

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:36.740
tells her that Nick isn’t home and asks
her to leave. But Dallas barges in anyway.

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:40.720
Thinking that Dallas is a friend of Casey,
doctor Jarvis welcomes her and wants to ask

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:45.530
her a few questions about Casey. Casey goes
to call Nick and tells him about his friend.

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:50.290
Meanwhile, Doctor Jarvis asks Dallas about
the past life of Casey. Then Dallas reveals

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:54.240
that Casey used to be a drug dealer with Nick.
He was a ruthless drug dealer who wasn’t

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:58.680
afraid of anyone. He would kill anyone he
liked, without a blink of an eye.

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:02.860
After hearing the true story of Casey’s
past, Doctor Jarvis wants to leave from there.

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:07.410
He obviously isn’t going to evaluate Casey
as fit for adopting a baby. Casey tries to

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:11.900
stop him as he is the last hope for him and
his wife to finally have a baby. But, Doctor

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:16.060
Jarvis doesn’t listen to him and leaves.
After he leaves, it’s Dallas’ turn to

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:20.240
pull the gun on Casey. She ties him up to
a chair and asks him about the 2 million that

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:21.449
Nick brought with him.

00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:26.330
Casey had only seen the drugs. He doesn’t
know anything about the money. So, he answers

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:30.419
that he knows nothing about any money. Dallas
gets on top of Casey and tells him that he

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:34.670
has gone soft after he quit. Casey tells her
that anyone would have quit, if they had done

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:38.560
the same thing as him. It is then revealed
that the real reason behind Casey leaving

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:42.530
the life of a drug dealer was, because he
had killed a woman who was pregnant. The guilt

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:46.770
of it was so unbearable for him that he decided
to quit and then pursued architecture.

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:50.949
Dallas mocks him for his story and tells him
that she will wait for Nick to come. Until

00:06:50.949 --> 00:06:55.180
then, she plans to have sex with Casey. But
he refuses and tells her that he is a married

00:06:55.180 --> 00:07:00.540
man. Hearing this, Dallas gets even more excited.
She opens her clothes and then forces herself

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:05.340
on Casey. At this point, Dallas is clearly
sexually assaulting Casey. But it doesn’t

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:10.110
last long, as she gets shot from behind. And
the man that shot her identifies himself as

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:14.460
Billy. Much like Dallas, he too is a friend
of Nick and is here for the money. He tells

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:19.040
Casey that Nick had stolen 2 million from
a cop and had it hidden somewhere. Billy thinks

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:23.540
that Casey knows where the money is hidden.
So, he plans to torture Casey in telling him

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:27.910
about the location of the money. But just
then, they hear a police siren. Billy puts

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:30.720
his torture tools down and then goes to check.

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:35.110
At the same moment, Casey manages to get himself
free. He cuts the duct tape that was tying

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:40.600
him and then grabs a pan from the kitchen.
He sits exactly like before to avert any suspicion.

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:44.449
Billy comes back and tells Casey that the
police had come to the neighbours. He picks

00:07:44.449 --> 00:07:48.780
the torture tools and then notices the duct
tape on the table, he knows Casey has freed

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:52.850
himself. Their eyes meet, and before Billy
could do anything, Casey smacks him with the

00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:57.780
frying pan. Casey hits him a few more times
and then pulls the gun on him. Casey almost

00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:02.150
kills him but remembers that he is not the
same person anymore. So, he takes him to the

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:05.880
garage and ties him upside down just like
the hit man from before.

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:10.380
Now, with how his day has gone so far, Casey
is mad. He gets a call from Nick who says

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:14.320
that he will be leaving the city. Casey tells
him to come and clean the mess that he has

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:19.040
created. But, Nick answers that he is in no
situation to come to his house. Nick tells

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:23.110
him that he is going to leave the city. The
people he stole the drugs from, were after

00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:28.169
him. So, he has to leave the city to save
his life. Then, Nick also tells him that the

00:08:28.169 --> 00:08:33.010
cop, he stole the money from, will come after
Casey. Then we see that Nick has been shot.

00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:37.569
Hearing his voice, Casey realizes it as well.
Nick apologizes to Casey and tells him to

00:08:37.569 --> 00:08:42.199
go to France to save his life. Then, the two
friends say their goodbye and hang up.

00:08:42.199 --> 00:08:46.699
Casey, now cleans the blood from his house
and changes into new clothes. The cop that

00:08:46.699 --> 00:08:51.480
Nick told him about also arrives at Casey’s
house. The cop, like all the others that Casey

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:56.170
had met that day, asks him about the money.
Casey tells him the same answer. He doesn’t

00:08:56.170 --> 00:09:00.139
know where Nick has hid the money. The cop
tells Casey that he believes him, but he also

00:09:00.139 --> 00:09:04.129
knows about everything that has gone on in
his house that day. He tells Casey that if

00:09:04.129 --> 00:09:08.720
he manages to bring the money by 7 pm, he
will let everything go. Basically, he was

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:13.130
blackmailing Casey about the dead body and
two other captives in his garage. The cop

00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:17.429
asks where the dead body is. Casey takes him
to the garage and after seeing two people

00:09:17.429 --> 00:09:22.429
hanging upside down, the cop kills them both.
He tells Casey that he has until 7 pm to bring

00:09:22.429 --> 00:09:23.490
him his money.

00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:27.779
Casey then gets rid of the dead body by cutting
it and throwing it in the garbage bag. While

00:09:27.779 --> 00:09:31.699
returning back to his house, he sees that
Nick’s car is still there. He looks at the

00:09:31.699 --> 00:09:36.380
tire and thinks about the flat tire that Nick
had told him about. Nick cuts the tire open,

00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:40.519
and there he finds the 2 million that everyone
was after today. He smiles after looking at

00:09:40.519 --> 00:09:45.509
the money. And then, he also finds a gift
box left by Nick. he opens it to find two

00:09:45.509 --> 00:09:49.689
watches. These were gifts from Nick to Casey
and his wife for their wedding day. Nick and

00:09:49.689 --> 00:09:53.790
Casey were really good friends. Nick knew
that Casey would find the money.

00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:58.360
After this, Casey takes the phone from the
hit man, or the pizza guy. He calls the drug

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:02.230
dealer from whom Nick had stolen the drugs
from. Casey tells them that if they want their

00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:05.550
drugs, they have to meet him at his house
at exactly 7 pm.

00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:10.800
It’s finally 7 pm. The cops get to Casey’s
house but don’t find him there. At the same

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:14.759
time, the drug dealers arrive as well. With
guns in their hands, they enter Casey’s

00:10:14.759 --> 00:10:18.760
house, only to find the cops. You can guess
what happened afterwards.

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:24.029
Now, we see that Casey goes to meet his wife.
Christine is surprised to see Casey there.

00:10:24.029 --> 00:10:28.149
She asks him why he was there. Casey answers
that he is leaving for France and he wants

00:10:28.149 --> 00:10:33.040
her to come with him. Christine understands
that Casey has got himself in trouble. Christine

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:37.670
doesn’t know what to do. She has a career
here, but she also loves Casey. Thinking that

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:42.339
Christine will not come with him, Casey plans
to leave by himself. But, Christine stops

00:10:42.339 --> 00:10:46.920
Casey and tells him that she doesn’t want
to leave him. She agrees to come with Casey.

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:51.709
Casey then shows her the 2 million dollars.
Christine asks him how he got this money.

00:10:51.709 --> 00:10:55.709
Casey tells her that once they reach France,
he will tell her about everything.

00:10:55.709 --> 00:10:59.079
And after that, they both leave in their car.
And the movie ends.

00:10:59.079 --> 00:11:03.130
