for years mysterious serial killings accidents&nbsp;
suicides and crimes were happening in shadyside

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.920
here an urban legend of which sarah fear was&nbsp;
popular for many years people believed that it was

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:59.040
the witch who made them commit violent crimes it&nbsp;
was such a popular urban legend that people even

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.920
made a nursery rhyme over it at the beginning&nbsp;
of the film we see a teenage girl heather

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:10.960
she was working till midnight in the bookstore&nbsp;
of a shadyside mall the mall was now closed now

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:16.240
heather asks her friend ryan to drop her home&nbsp;
ryan was excited as his shift was also ending

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:22.640
in 15 minutes here we see martin a janitor who&nbsp;
was cleaning the mall it's rather odd i must

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:29.360
say cleaning the mall at midnight now ryan hears a&nbsp;
lady's whispering voice which confuses him further

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.600
heather was closing the store then suddenly the&nbsp;
books in the store started falling on their own

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.840
upon checking it there was no one except heather&nbsp;
then a man wearing a skull mask advances towards

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.600
heather he starts putting a knife in her stomach&nbsp;
heather screams and blocks the knife with the book

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:53.120
obviously this scene is in homage to the&nbsp;
movie scream released in 1996 heather panics

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:59.840
and starts running the skull mask man follows her&nbsp;
heather hides in another counter and calls 9-1-1

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.640
after a few minutes mask man finds her&nbsp;
and this time he pokes the knife into her

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.840
heather starts running again&nbsp;
but this time she falls down

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:14.000
while fighting heather removes the mask of the&nbsp;
attacker to her surprise it was none other than

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.400
ryan he seemed as if he was possessed the police&nbsp;
officer nick good comes in time and shoots ryan in

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.520

quick recap of the historical crimes that happened

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:42.480
at the shady side all these crime stories are part&nbsp;
of this film series which we will see in this film

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.440

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.840
here we see another teenager dina who had a&nbsp;
breakup with her girlfriend sam sam went from

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:05.200
shadyside high school to sunnyvale high school&nbsp;
dina's brother josh was a nerd who was a member

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.320
of the online witch community he was secretly&nbsp;
cheating with an unknown handler named queen of

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:15.600
air and darkness josh thinks these seven killings&nbsp;
are again the result of sarah fear's possession

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.880
josh had a lot of interests in this switch&nbsp;
theory he had done a lot of research on

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:27.280
shadyside crimes and collected a ton of files&nbsp;
images and resources on sarah fear but dina here

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.480
thinks her brother's interest is stupid and she&nbsp;
takes him to school with her at school dina meets

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.600
her friends kate and simon here we also see&nbsp;
messages of condolence on heather's locker

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.400
kate and simon were in the business of&nbsp;
selling illegal prescription drugs at school

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:48.320
rumors in school were that the witch was behind&nbsp;
these killings as the killer wore a skull mask

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:53.440
which was a clear sign of a normal person gone&nbsp;
insane that's why to remind everyone about it

00:03:54.240 --> 00:04:00.320
some idiot students spray painted witch's rhyme on&nbsp;
the girl's toilet there were lines like these she

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:05.600
will rise from the grave make good men her slaves&nbsp;
she will take your blood she will take your head

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:11.920
she will follow you till you are dead deena finds&nbsp;
all this legend a stupid hoax and she also scolds

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:17.920
simon for selling drugs as simon's brother timothy&nbsp;
had barely survived an overdose a few days earlier

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.840
here dina and sam were both cheerleaders dina&nbsp;
left the sport after her breakup with sam

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:28.560
tonight there was going to be a match between&nbsp;
shadyside and sunnyvale football teams

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.840
here the sunnyvale team was planning to hold a&nbsp;
candle vigil to pay tribute to the students who

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:39.520
died on the mall massacre for this the pe teacher&nbsp;
makes dina and the rest of the students attendance

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:44.720
compulsory dina goes to the sunnyvale school along&nbsp;
with her costume and the rest of the students

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.400
there she saw sam with a guy&nbsp;
named peter who was a footballer

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:54.720
peter was literally groping sam which irks dina&nbsp;
the enmity between the two teams was quite old

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.080
during the vigil itself both&nbsp;
the teams started fighting

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.840
after the match sam meets dina where dina wishes&nbsp;
her a goodbye by giving her some of her belongings

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:10.400
denna was angry here as her heart was broken later&nbsp;
peter and sunnyvale footballers were following

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:15.600
the shadyside football team bus from their car&nbsp;
they were abusing them throwing bottles at them

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:22.320
sam was also with them in the car dina gets very&nbsp;
angry seeing this she opens the emergency exit

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:27.600
door and goes to pour ice cubes on them but kate&nbsp;
stops her and says you are bleeding from the nose

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:33.120
when dennis starts checking her nose the icebox&nbsp;
accidentally falls from her hand and directly

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:39.440
lands on the incoming sunnyvaler's car causing&nbsp;
a car accident later we see sam crawling out of

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:44.240
the car she was bleeding from the nose too&nbsp;
now her hand soaked in blood goes under the

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:49.760
soil as the place was soft along with this sam&nbsp;
starts seeing some visions and hearing voices

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:56.960
later we see dina simon and kate beside sam and&nbsp;
they apologize to her sam vomits blood here which

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:03.920
falls on simon's shirt and dina's boot later peter&nbsp;
threatens dina for a car crash all these kids lie

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:09.440
to officer good by saying it was just an accident&nbsp;
now we hear a lady's whispering voice from peter's

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:15.760
car crash site on next day evening dina was&nbsp;
watching news on tv where janitor martin was

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:21.280
giving a bite to a reporter martin says ryan&nbsp;
was a good person he enjoyed reading comics

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:27.840
martin also believed that ryan was possessed the&nbsp;
police had now declared ryan to be a serial killer

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:32.080
on the same night we see a man wearing&nbsp;
a skull mask in front of dina's house

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:37.840
dina thinks it's peter who has arrived here to&nbsp;
prank her deena comes inside the house after

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:42.880
shouting at him for minutes after a few moments&nbsp;
we see the same man in front of dina's kitchen

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:48.960
this time there was a knife in his hand this&nbsp;
time josh also saw that man dina angrily goes

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:54.560
out with a knife but that guy vanished in thin air&nbsp;
deena angrily sends a message on the pager to kate

00:06:55.280 --> 00:07:00.320
oh man how can we forget those days when we&nbsp;
used to send messages on that little black box

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:06.080
feeling really nostalgic kate and simon&nbsp;
were doing babysitting work in one house

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:12.480
simon wore the same shirt he had last night the&nbsp;
one on which sam's blood was all over kate asks

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:19.120
simon to change it kate reads dina's message and&nbsp;
calls her back dina tells her about stalking peter

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:24.960
suddenly there was some noise in kate's house too&nbsp;
upon checking it the same skull mask man was there

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:30.880
too he was looking for something in the clothes&nbsp;
as soon as he sees kate and simon he disappears

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:36.800
later we see confused simon and kate arrive&nbsp;
at dina's house where simon was wearing the

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:42.080
same shirt with blood stains these three were&nbsp;
very angry with sam as for them it seemed the

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:47.040
prank has gone too far these three and josh&nbsp;
arrive at the hospital where sam was admitted

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:54.800
dina accuses peter of pranks which sam denies sam&nbsp;
says peter was with me this whole time upon seeing

00:07:54.800 --> 00:08:00.560
peter there dina starts arguing with sam suddenly&nbsp;
we see blood coming out of peter's mouth where

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:06.000
that skull mask man has stabbed him sam and dina&nbsp;
scream in panic and start to run away from him by

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.960
attacking him the rest of the kids also started&nbsp;
running as they also saw the skull mask man

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:17.840
in a hurry they hijack an ambulance parked outside&nbsp;
the hospital how convenient somebody just left an

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:23.360
ambulance for kids to drive around like a toy sam&nbsp;
and dina hide at the reception counter where skull

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:29.360
mask man kills a few nurses later he tries to&nbsp;
attack sam but dina attacks him first from behind

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:36.960
she opens his mask and we see ryan again this&nbsp;
dead dude was killing people whom dina identifies

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:42.560
as ryan from news she was confused and in panic&nbsp;
so without thinking much she ran away from him

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:46.800
now the kids are at the police station&nbsp;
and explaining everything to officer good

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:51.040
here we see martin being arrested&nbsp;
for some petty crimes which he denies

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:56.400
officer good shows these kids the photo of&nbsp;
ryan and says i myself have killed this boy

00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:01.920
dead can't kill people he knew the lying&nbsp;
habit of these kids hence he does not take

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:06.880
the words of these kids seriously dina starts&nbsp;
shouting angrily while leaving the station

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:13.200
she pushes another officer and steals his pistol&nbsp;
we see simon taking a leak around a corner where

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:18.640
he hears an old song a teenage girl was sitting by&nbsp;
the roadside of the road and was singing that song

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:24.720
as simon approaches her she attacks his legs&nbsp;
with a shaving blade simon starts running but

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:29.920
she drops him and sits on top of him while these&nbsp;
two were fighting the girl's locket fell away

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:34.720
she was about to run the blade blindly on&nbsp;
simon then deena fired shots at her from

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:39.360
behind simon gets up and starts running&nbsp;
while the attacker girl also gets up

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:45.920
apparently she hadn't died and black liquid was&nbsp;
coming out of her body later we see these kids

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:51.520
at dina's house where simon was completely freaked&nbsp;
out he explains everything exactly how it happened

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:57.600
on hearing this josh brings up one old newspaper&nbsp;
clipping which was about that teenager ruby lane

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:04.400
he asks simon if this is the girl to which simon&nbsp;
says yes now josh starts narrating the shadyside's

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:09.600
history it was said that ruby lane was a teenager&nbsp;
who had murdered her friends and died by cutting

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:15.840
her hand with a shaving blade in the year 1978&nbsp;
a psycho killed several people at camp nightwing

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:23.280
in 1950 a milkman named harry rooker killed&nbsp;
several housewives 1935 humpty couple killer

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:30.160
case 1922 billy barker case 1904 grifter&nbsp;
guts girls case 1666 pastor miller case

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:35.360
all these people were normal before but&nbsp;
suddenly they changed by showing these

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:41.680
things josh justifies his witch theory about&nbsp;
this town here kate recognizes the 1978 incident

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:47.040
as her aunt died there sam can't digest this&nbsp;
brutal history she starts vomiting blood again

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:52.880
dina takes care of her and these two start&nbsp;
talking these two were now coming close again

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:58.160
as they discussed their pain and feeling sam says&nbsp;
she had no choice but to go to sunnyvale as her

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:03.760
mom got divorced sam was hesitant to openly&nbsp;
accept her sexuality and love towards dina

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:10.240
meanwhile josh continues with his lecture and&nbsp;
says in the year 1666 sarah fear was hanged by

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:15.200
people for witchcraft since then she has been&nbsp;
taking revenge and has been committing crime by

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:20.000
possessing good men of the town many people&nbsp;
believe that she cheated death before dying

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:25.360
as written in the nursery rhymes just before she&nbsp;
died she did a trick by cutting her cursed hand

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:30.160
she made a deal with the devil to take revenge&nbsp;
on the town's people for generations to come

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:34.880
here josh believes that this story is true&nbsp;
and that the witch is really behind all this

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:41.920
kate here raises an important question of why they&nbsp;
are being haunted what have they done wrong to her

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:47.440
sam answers this question by saying i saw the&nbsp;
witch yesterday near the car crash site i had a

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:52.800
few visions i am pretty sure it was her all the&nbsp;
kids now come to the crash site in an ambulance

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:58.800
sam puts his hand in the mud by the side of&nbsp;
the car there she finds some bones josh finds

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:03.680
a lock on which fear was written this means&nbsp;
that yesterday sam inadvertently disturbed

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:10.480
the grave of sarah fear simon here suggests a&nbsp;
silly idea he says like in the film poltergeist

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:14.480
if we fix this grave and apologize then&nbsp;
there may be a chance that she will spare us

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:21.280
josh likes this idea and kids start to rearrange&nbsp;
those bones in a proper order meanwhile sam's

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:26.480
nose was bleeding again when she touches bone with&nbsp;
her blood-smeared hand she gets the vision again

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:33.600
this time she hears a voice saying it's you it's&nbsp;
you meaning the witch was only behind sam and not

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:39.760
the rest of the kids the kids now close the&nbsp;
grave and say sorry at the same time we see

00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:46.640
another witch's henchman advancing towards these&nbsp;
kids he was the nightwing killer of 1978 he starts

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:51.840
attacking everyone with an axe the kids survive&nbsp;
somehow and start running again in the ambulance

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:56.800
here sam explains to everyone that the witch is&nbsp;
really just after her the rest have nothing to

00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:02.000
do with her but dina here disagrees and says&nbsp;
what about the skull masked man attacking her

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.560
at her own house what about he attacking&nbsp;
kate and simon at their babysitting house

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:11.440
then kate suddenly stops the ambulance&nbsp;
and says the mask man was not stalking us

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:17.600
he was searching for some clothes she then tears&nbsp;
simon's jacket and shows the bloodstained shirt

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:23.600
she points at dina's shoes which were also stained&nbsp;
with blood kate says the henchmen are using sam's

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:29.760
blood as a gps tracker josh now suggests an idea&nbsp;
of using sam as a bait to kill these henchmen

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:36.720
to which dena objects but sam agrees and these&nbsp;
kids go ahead with their plan the officer good

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:41.360
checks the hospital where he finds dead&nbsp;
bodies he also finds ruby's necklace on

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:46.640
the road all these kids arrive at school and&nbsp;
take a good shower to clean any trace of blood

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:51.280
later dina cuts sam's hand and collects&nbsp;
a few drops of her blood in a bucket

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:58.000
simon fetches some highly flammable chemicals and&nbsp;
pours them around the girl's toilet josh also rubs

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:03.360
water filled with sam's blood around the toilet&nbsp;
all these kids now make sam sit on that toilet

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:09.600
there was an opening above to escape dina&nbsp;
simon josh and kate were now waiting outside

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:15.440
after some time skull mask ruby nightwing killer&nbsp;
arrives at the school and goes straight to the

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:22.720
toilet as soon as they enter the room kate locks&nbsp;
them in dina sets the fire the fire starts burning

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:28.880
all three of them yes here sam had run away from&nbsp;
the toilet through that opening above after some

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:34.400
time the kids see a black sledge everywhere but&nbsp;
like in the terminator part 2 film this sludge

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:40.720
was rejoining again meaning these henchmen were&nbsp;
unkillable now we see kids hiding in a classroom

00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:45.440
kate says we tried everything we could to save&nbsp;
sam from the witch's curse but now it's time

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:51.680
if it's really sam that the witch needs then it's&nbsp;
better we give her that else we all will die sam

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:57.840
says yes to this but dina says no she tries to&nbsp;
stop sam from leaving the room but simon grabs her

00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:02.400
now sam was waiting outside the room when&nbsp;
josh found one of his old news clippings

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:10.960
he was carrying all his data in his backpack&nbsp;
apparently anyway he says in the year 1978

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:15.920
there was one girl named c berman who claimed&nbsp;
that she too saw the witch she was the sole

00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:21.120
survivor of the massacre deena calls c berman by&nbsp;
getting her number from the telephone directory

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.960
yes those were the days when privacy was&nbsp;
public deena gets no response as it was on

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:32.560
the answering machine later sam finds out that&nbsp;
c berman survived that massacre by dying first

00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:38.960
she was clinically dead for a few minutes then&nbsp;
later was revived by cpr the kids now decide to

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:44.240
try this dangerous method all by themselves as&nbsp;
they had no option we now see officer good in

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:49.280
front of a deserted house he put a message under&nbsp;
that house in which it was written it's happening

00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:53.840
again meaning it is clear that the good officer&nbsp;
knew something that he was not telling anyone

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:59.280
maybe we will come to know about it in the&nbsp;
next movie all the kids now come to the same

00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:03.920
mall which we saw in the first scene it was&nbsp;
late at night so there was no one in the mall

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:09.680
this was simon's part-time workplace too here&nbsp;
he tells about his brother timothy's case

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:14.160
how he died of drug overdose and how he&nbsp;
was saved from an adrenaline injection

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:19.920
he also gives all the drugs to sam and asks&nbsp;
her to take it at an interval he gives dena

00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:24.880
adrenaline injections sam asks kate to go&nbsp;
home and she doesn't want to put her in danger

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:32.240
kate decides to remain with her friend till the&nbsp;
very end so nice now simon kate and josh go to

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:36.560
different parts of the mall by sneering sam's&nbsp;
blood on them so as to distract the killers

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:43.200
now sam takes the drug pill for some time killers&nbsp;
didn't arrive but when sam was fully wasted skull

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:50.640
mask arrived he tries to attack her in dina but&nbsp;
kate arrives in time and sets him on fire this

00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:55.760
pisses him off as he starts chasing her later he&nbsp;
catches her and shreds her face in a shredding

00:16:55.760 --> 00:17:01.680
machine dina was running with sam where she lost&nbsp;
the rest of her drugs in order to save sam from

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:07.440
the henchman sam's heart needed to be stopped by&nbsp;
any cost deena now immerses sam's face in a fish

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:13.680
tank so that she can die by drowning kate dies&nbsp;
a horrible death simon and josh were seeing kate

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:18.640
dead body in shock just then the nightwing&nbsp;
killer hits simon in the head with an axe

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:26.560
simon also dies skull mask man was now chasing&nbsp;
josh who falls in front of dina suddenly sam's

00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:33.200
heart stops due to drowning she dies clinically as&nbsp;
soon as she dies the skull masked man disappears

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.880
deena gives sam three adrenaline injections due to&nbsp;
which sam comes to her senses after a few moments

00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:44.400
later officer good takes a separate interview of&nbsp;
sam dina and josh where all three tell a bunch

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:49.520
of lies again officer goode says after taking&nbsp;
a good look at sam you are looking like a ghost

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:54.160
he declares simon and kate to be victims&nbsp;
of a drug-related cartel gang war

00:17:55.040 --> 00:18:00.480
next night when dina and sam were intimate&nbsp;
dina gets a call from lady c berman berman

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:04.480
says you are alive as of now you have stopped&nbsp;
the henchmen of the witch but not the witch

00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:11.200
she makes the rules you are not safe here we&nbsp;
see some glimpses of that witch she was doing

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:16.880
some rituals there were names of all the people&nbsp;
who were possessed by the witch now sam's name

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:24.080
gets added to it dina turns around where we see&nbsp;
possessed sam she stabs dina after a struggle

00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:30.800
dina subdues sam and ties her up just as josh&nbsp;
runs back upstairs dina then looks at sam and

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:36.800
vows to bring her back from possession all while&nbsp;
sam roars at her we also see an end credits in the

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:43.840
film where dina and josh meets e burman she starts&nbsp;
telling them her 1978 story which is the story

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:50.640
of the second film in this series so friends this&nbsp;
was the story of the film fear street part 1 1994

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:56.960
the film is set at a very fast pace it may seem&nbsp;
exhausting at first but overall it's a good film
