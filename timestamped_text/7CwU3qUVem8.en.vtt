00:17:55.399 --> 00:17:55.409 align:start position:0%
staying on the throne so I think that
 

00:17:55.409 --> 00:17:56.269 align:start position:0%
staying on the throne so I think that
would<00:17:55.500><c> involve</c><00:17:55.710><c> first</c><00:17:55.980><c> of</c><00:17:56.070><c> all</c><00:17:56.129><c> are</c><00:17:56.250><c> you</c>

00:17:56.269 --> 00:17:56.279 align:start position:0%
would involve first of all are you
 

00:17:56.279 --> 00:17:58.639 align:start position:0%

00:17:58.639 --> 00:17:58.649 align:start position:0%
getting killed it but I think that the
 

00:17:58.649 --> 00:18:01.490 align:start position:0%
getting killed it but I think that the
