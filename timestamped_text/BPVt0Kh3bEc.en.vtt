00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.737
Welcome to Movies Explained, today we're looking at, The Ritual

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:10.000
The movie starts with Five friends Robert, Hutch,&nbsp;
Phil, Dom, and Luke planning a group vacation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:18.560
They all come up with different ideas of going&nbsp;
to Amsterdam, Berlin, Belgium, etc., when Robert&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:25.040
suggests hiking in Sweden. No one is pleased&nbsp;
with his opinion, and so the idea gets rejected.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:29.200
While going back, Luke asks his friends if they&nbsp;
want to come with him to get a bottle of wine.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.520
Robert agrees to accompany him. They enter&nbsp;
the shop and look for bottles of alcohol&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.680
when Robert sees a woman lying on the floor,&nbsp;
injured, they realize there’s a robbery in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.720
progress. Luke escapes the sight of the robbers&nbsp;
and hides behind a shelf. The robbers come to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.760
Robert and ask him to give up his wallet,&nbsp;
rings, and any other valuables items he has.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.560
He refuses to hand them his wedding ring, so an&nbsp;
argument starts between Robert and the robbers.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.720
Luke is still hiding, trying to decide whether&nbsp;
to intervene or not when one of the bad guys&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.760
kills Robert. The scene shifts to 6 months later&nbsp;
when Luke comes out of a tent surrounded by his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.720
friends. They start hiking between the beautiful&nbsp;
hills. They reach the top spot, and as a token to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.840
remember Robert, they put his picture on a rock&nbsp;
and drink in his name. Everyone dips in nostalgia&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.880
and says he was a good man, the better of us. Luke&nbsp;
says that it should never have happened, but it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.600
did. The night falls, and everyone starts talking&nbsp;
about how much Robert must have loved this place.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.880
No one was particularly pleased with the journey,&nbsp;
but they did it anyway for Rob. Hutch suggests&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.920
doing a little bit more hiking to make the most of&nbsp;
their trip, but Luke refuses and says it's enough&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:35.120
for me. They are heading back to the lodge when&nbsp;
Dom falls and gets his ankle twisted. They decide&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:40.000
to take a shorter passage through the forest.&nbsp;
Hutch gets excited about the off-trail hiking.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.240
After the walk some distance, Luke suggests&nbsp;
leaving Phil and Dom behind to get some help.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.760
Dom immediately rejects the idea and says he can&nbsp;
walk if they take the quicker route. They continue&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.920
to walk through the forest, taking pictures,&nbsp;
talking, being unaware of what strange thing they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.080
have gotten themselves in. While they are moving&nbsp;
between the trees, Phil says that this forest is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.880
awkwardly quiet, but Dom shuts his thoughts by&nbsp;
saying that the trees absorb sound, making the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.680
place calm and nothing unusual. After walking some&nbsp;
distance, they decide to get some rest. They start&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.000
again and are discussing their university life&nbsp;
when they see blood dripping down from a tree.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.640
A body ripped open and gutted is hanging from a&nbsp;
tree. They also saw some strange symbols on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.080
tree. The group members become suspicious&nbsp;
and start making guesses about why someone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.560
would hang a body from the tree like this. The&nbsp;
blood was still fresh, so they kept moving.&nbsp;

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.720
It starts raining, and they have to look for&nbsp;
shelter. The pals see a house from some distance&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.880
and decide to check it out. Dom suggests leaving&nbsp;
and going from that place, but others break into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.880
the house as they cannot stay out in the rain.&nbsp;
While they all are trying to settle, Luke hears&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.711
some distorted voices coming from outside. He asks&nbsp;
his friends if they heard any voice coming from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.711 --> 00:02:42.080
outside, but they all tell him they didn't. They&nbsp;
find some necklaces with the same symbols they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.120
saw outside, in the abandoned house. They want to&nbsp;
start a fire in that place, so they ask Phil to go&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.920
up and look for some wood. There is total darkness&nbsp;
up the staircase. Phil uses his torch to open the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.880
door and yells at everyone to leave after seeing&nbsp;
what is inside. Everyone comes to see why Phil got&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:02.960
upset. A statue made of twigs of a decapitated&nbsp;
human torso with antlers for hands was hanging&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:07.440
in the room. Phil says it was something related to&nbsp;
witchcraft. Others are not bothered by that thing,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.280
so they go down to get the fire started.
They discuss that Pagans and Nordic people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.280
may have lived in this place because who else&nbsp;
can think to live in the middle of nowhere.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.600
Hutch tries to make his friends comfortable by&nbsp;
saying that we will be okay as we have food and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.400
supplies for now. They all talk for some time&nbsp;
and then go to sleep. Soft knocking and growling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.120
sound keeps coming up from the darkness outside.&nbsp;
Luke wakes up from his sleep. A light appears to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.280
come from outside the window. He follows the&nbsp;
light, taking him to the memory where Robert&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.760
died in the shop. He comes back to reality from&nbsp;
his nightmare and finds himself standing outside&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.840
the house with drops of blood on his shirt. He&nbsp;
finds punctured wounds on his chest. Hutch also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.160
wakes up screaming. Luke goes inside and sees&nbsp;
everyone panicked and scared by the nightmares&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:51.200
they just had. Phil is missing. They go upstairs&nbsp;
to check for him, where they find him naked,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.600
praying to the statue. Everyone gets ready to go,&nbsp;
and no one talks about what has just happened.&nbsp;

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.520
Luke is standing by a tree, looking at the&nbsp;
symbols. Others say that this is a warning&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.600
for them. Dom spots a path and asks his friends&nbsp;
to follow him down it. While they are moving,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:08.400
Phil asks to discuss what just happened to them.&nbsp;
Hutch says it was just a bad dream, a nightmare,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.240
and they just spooked because of it. Nothing else&nbsp;
happened. Phil continued insisting that something&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:17.440
was there. Something made him go naked and pray&nbsp;
to that statue. Luke becomes angry at Phil saying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.280
it’s all non-sense and tells him that listen to&nbsp;
what he’s are saying. Dom is determined to get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:26.320
out of that place. After some time, Dom gets tired&nbsp;
and decides to rest for a while. The others become&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.800
angry at him for slowing them down. They tell him&nbsp;
to bear the pain and move faster, or they will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.280
never get out of that place. Dom does not respond&nbsp;
to them and doesn’t move. Luke decides to go and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.440
see how far they have to go. He is standing in&nbsp;
the middle of the forest, looking at the wounds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:44.080
on his chest, when he hears low growls. Luke sees&nbsp;
a creature in the woods and runs back to tell his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.480
friends about it. He explains to them there is&nbsp;
something big in the woods. No one seems to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:52.160
moved by this, so Luke shows his wounds to them&nbsp;
and asks them if there is no one, then how did he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.560
get those wounds. Dom denies everything he is&nbsp;
saying and argues with Luke. Dom says to him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.800
that we are here because of you. Luke comes back&nbsp;
at him to which Dom says, where was this fight&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.680
when Robert was dying in front of you. Luke takes&nbsp;
his backpack and leaves when Dom says that robbers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:10.320
cracked Rob's head in half and Luke didn't even&nbsp;
have a single drop of blood on him. In anger, he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:15.920
punches Dom. Hutch steps in and breaks the fight.&nbsp;
Luke is leaving when Hutch tries to stop him. Luke&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:21.040
is disturbed by what Dom had said, and so he asks&nbsp;
Hutch that it was, is his fault that he didn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:24.960
stand up to the robbers when Rob died? Hutch does&nbsp;
not answer. They continue walking without saying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.120
anything. While they are walking, they see some&nbsp;
fabric buried in the ground. They pull that thing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:35.200
out and find a tent, a picture, and a credit card&nbsp;
that expired in 1984. Hutch tries to lighten the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:40.000
tension and says, we will not end up like these&nbsp;
people. People will come looking for us as we have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.040
registered in the lodge. Hutch takes Luke to a&nbsp;
corner and says that Phil is not looking good and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:49.440
Dom is also suffering because of his knee. He is&nbsp;
strong, so he should go and look for help in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:53.200
morning. He will stay with the two friends. The&nbsp;
sound of branches snapping and growling continues.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:58.080
Luke is in his tent when he hears roaring and&nbsp;
screeching. He unzips the tent and sneaks out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:02.800
to take a look. He’s once again taken to his&nbsp;
memory of the day Robert was killed. He hears&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:07.440
someone calling him a coward and wakes up from the&nbsp;
dream upon hearing Phil scream. When he inspects&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:12.480
the situation, he finds out that Hutch is missing&nbsp;
and that Phil saw a creature, shadows taking him.&nbsp;

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:16.560
They hear Hutch’s screams coming from a distance.&nbsp;
Everyone is scared, but they gather the courage&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:20.640
to go and find Hutch. They follow the steps&nbsp;
in the mud, and after covering some distance,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:24.800
they find him ripped open, hanging from a tree.&nbsp;
They take him down, and everyone is crying about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:29.200
losing another friend. Luke says to go because&nbsp;
the creature that did this will be coming back,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:35.040
but Dom insists on giving Hutch a proper burial.&nbsp;
Dom argues on this with Luke. He says to keep his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:38.880
voice down. He tries to calm them by saying&nbsp;
that I have a knife, and we know the path&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:43.360
Hutch told us so we can safely get out of the&nbsp;
forest. They keep going. They stop to drink water&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:47.360
when they see foot prints in the mud. Dom suggests&nbsp;
that it means there are people out there. Luke&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:52.400
decides not to follow them and continues going to&nbsp;
Southwest. Everyone is disturbed by what happened,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:55.760
but Luke tells them that they are far&nbsp;
from that house now and are somehow safe.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:00.880
Dom stops to gasp some air. Luke moves to get a&nbsp;
look at where they have reached. He sees the end&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:04.720
and comes back to tell his friends about it. Luke&nbsp;
finds out that the creature has attacked Phil and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:08.480
that his friends are not there. Luke again&nbsp;
goes into his nightmare, and when he snaps&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:12.800
back into reality, he starts looking for his&nbsp;
friends. Luke finds Dom hiding behind a tree,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:17.040
scared to death. Dom says he doesn't know what&nbsp;
happened, but they figured out that the creature&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:21.760
was hunting them. Luke tells him that he has found&nbsp;
a way out and will not let anything happen to Dom.&nbsp;

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:25.840
The sound of the branches snapping continues in&nbsp;
the darkness. Luke tells Dom that he will count&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:29.920
down from 3, and then they will run as fast as&nbsp;
possible. The heavy footsteps start to follow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:33.840
them, and the growling grows louder. They spot the&nbsp;
creature and run from it. After wandering through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:37.840
the forest for a while they find Phil's body&nbsp;
hanging from a tree. They continue running through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:41.440
the forest as the creature seemingly follows&nbsp;
them, they see a house, and when they enter it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:45.120
the radio is playing, and they see some&nbsp;
people in there. They are knocked out,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:48.960
and when they wake up, they find themselves&nbsp;
chained in a cellar. Luke tries to see out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:52.240
from an opening in the wooden wall and sees&nbsp;
some people. They plan to cut the rope with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:56.720
the glass of the bottle lying on the table when&nbsp;
two men and one woman enter the room. The woman&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:00.640
offers Luke some water and sees the wounds&nbsp;
on his chest. She also shows him the ones&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:04.960
on her. She then goes to Dom but doesn't offer&nbsp;
him water. Instead, she says something in an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:09.520
unknown language, and the man takes Dom outside&nbsp;
up the stairs. Luke hears thudding, growling,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:14.800
and crying. A girl visits Luke and says that the&nbsp;
people will prepare for the sacrifice ritual soon.&nbsp;

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:19.280
After some time, they bring Dom back to the&nbsp;
cellar. He is not in good shape and is bleeding.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:24.080
Luke asks him if he’s okay. Dom starts telling&nbsp;
him about the nightmare he saw in that house. Dom&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:28.800
says that he saw these people offering him to that&nbsp;
creature, and at the end, he saw his wife, Gayle.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:33.600
He says I will die here, but you have to live.&nbsp;
Burn the place down when you leave it and tell my&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:38.480
wife that I tried to get back to her. People then&nbsp;
take Dom for the sacrifice as Luke looks through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:43.360
the opening. The group chants meanwhile Luke&nbsp;
tries to get the cuffs off his hands. Dom yells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:47.760
at the people, “go on, what are you waiting for&nbsp;
now”. The creature appears from behind the trees,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:51.840
and people start bowing to him. Dom then sees&nbsp;
the image of her wife coming out of the forest.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:56.800
He didn't realize it was the creature until it&nbsp;
held him and hung him on the tree. Dom dies. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:01.600
girl comes to inform Luke that your ritual will&nbsp;
begin, and either you have to kneel before him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:06.160
or he will kill you like everyone else. Luke&nbsp;
asks the girl that what this creature is. She&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:12.000
says that it is an ancient god, one of the Jotunn&nbsp;
and offspring of Loki. Luke asks her why him? The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.040
girl replies that your pain is great. He tells her&nbsp;
that I am not like you and I will not live like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:22.080
you. When the girl goes, Luke sets himself free.
He opens the door and sees outside the room.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:26.800
He then takes the wooden stick lit with fire and&nbsp;
moves upstairs. When he opens the door, he finds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:32.240
a twisted congregation of mummified worshippers&nbsp;
that begin to move. He set them on fire and comes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:35.851
out of the room, attracting the Jotunn. Luke&nbsp;
finds a hunting rifle and loads it. The creature&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:35.851 --> 00:09:36.800
kills one of the followers and drops the body.&nbsp;
Luke runs from there, and while he is running,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:40.640
he looks back and gets a complete picture of&nbsp;
the creature. He tries to get a shot at it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:45.360
and after he does, the creature starts to follow&nbsp;
him. Jotunn messes with his mind and shows him the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:49.680
scene from the shop where Robert died. Luke keeps&nbsp;
running until the creature hits him, and he falls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:54.160
to the ground. The beast gives Luke a chance&nbsp;
to submit, but then he strikes it with an ax.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:58.480
Luke runs from there while the creature shrieks&nbsp;
and shouts. He keeps running until he finds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:03.200
