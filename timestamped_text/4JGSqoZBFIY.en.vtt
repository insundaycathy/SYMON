00:00:06.338 --> 00:00:07.826
hey what's up guys

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:11.810
today I'll show you a science fiction action film: "The Tomorrow War"

00:00:11.906 --> 00:00:14.594
spoiler ahead, watch out and take care

00:00:15.026 --> 00:00:19.826
the 2022 World Cup soccer match has gone to heat with three minutes of extra time

00:00:20.018 --> 00:00:22.625
as the Brazilian player has a one-shot chance

00:00:22.625 --> 00:00:27.554
all Brazilian fans in the stands and in front of the television, are waiting for the score

00:00:27.698 --> 00:00:32.786
unexpectedly, the match is interrupted by a group of armed soldiers from 2051

00:00:32.978 --> 00:00:35.762
they appear on the soccer field in a burst of light and smoke

00:00:35.858 --> 00:00:38.450
and announce that 30 years into the future

00:00:38.546 --> 00:00:42.338
the planet Earth is invaded by an alien race called the "Whitespikes"

00:00:42.578 --> 00:00:44.498
these are voracious and brutal creatures 

00:00:44.594 --> 00:00:48.050
whose only motivation is to destroy all life around them

00:00:48.146 --> 00:00:53.090
to balance the scales, the future soldiers have traveled to ask the present planet for help

00:00:53.282 --> 00:00:56.210
in response, nations work together to save humanity

00:00:56.306 --> 00:01:01.010
building time travel facilities and recruiting soldiers to fight the future war

00:01:01.154 --> 00:01:05.954
unfortunately, many batches of military forces have been sent to the future for duty

00:01:06.146 --> 00:01:10.658
but most of them lost their lives in the battle and only very few managed to come back

00:01:10.802 --> 00:01:13.010
eventually, a world draft begins 

00:01:13.058 --> 00:01:16.898
and groups of ordinary men and veterans are called forth for the mission 

00:01:17.234 --> 00:01:21.602
among those reluctantly recruited is Dan, a veteran of the Iraq War 

00:01:21.746 --> 00:01:23.714
Dan reports to the military base

00:01:23.858 --> 00:01:27.698
where he is fitted with a tracking device that will assist him in returnning

00:01:27.794 --> 00:01:29.618
if he is still alive after a week

00:01:29.714 --> 00:01:32.258
meanwhile, he learns from his certificate of death 

00:01:32.354 --> 00:01:36.386
that only those who have already died before the war starts are enlisted 

00:01:36.482 --> 00:01:39.410
and he will die in an accident in 2028 

00:01:39.554 --> 00:01:42.962
Dan returns home to bid farewell to his beloved daughter and wife 

00:01:43.058 --> 00:01:44.786
before leaving for the mission

00:01:45.034 --> 00:01:49.114
shortly after, Dan is thrown in with a group of fellow recruits for basic training

00:01:49.402 --> 00:01:52.378
as most of the recruits are civilians who can't use guns

00:01:52.426 --> 00:01:55.018
Dan realizes that the trip is doomed

00:01:55.258 --> 00:01:58.954
later, they travel to the future by use of the Jump Link technology

00:01:59.098 --> 00:02:00.730
which is still in beta mode

00:02:00.826 --> 00:02:04.234
because of that, before they even face those threatening creatures though

00:02:04.282 --> 00:02:07.498
most of the people do not survive the drop high above the city 

00:02:07.642 --> 00:02:12.394
Dan and some lucky ones escape death as they land in a high-rise rooftop swimming pool

00:02:12.682 --> 00:02:16.714
there, they are astonished to see the future city is reduced to burning rubbles

00:02:16.858 --> 00:02:21.994
with collapsed buildings, the wreckage of helicopters and corpses scattered all over the place

00:02:22.138 --> 00:02:24.150
the survivors are contacted by Colonel, a science whiz 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.806
and a commanding officer of the resistance

00:02:27.268 --> 00:02:32.740
Colonel appoints Dan as the temporary captain as he had led operations in Iraq War before

00:02:32.884 --> 00:02:36.676
since the authorities decide to blast the whole city overwhelmed by the beasts

00:02:36.772 --> 00:02:41.188
Dan's unit is deployed to rescue a nearby lab before the sterilization  

00:02:41.332 --> 00:02:46.132
the lab scientists developed a toxin, which is believed to be able to wipe out Whitespikes

00:02:46.276 --> 00:02:49.300
previous troops sent are trapped by the Whitespikes 

00:02:49.396 --> 00:02:54.004
since Dan has fought and survived war, the unit follows his instructions with faith

00:02:54.148 --> 00:02:59.236
when they reach the destination, they find the stranded troops and scientists have all died

00:02:59.476 --> 00:03:03.748
countless spikes on the wall stare at them as they make their entrance to the lab 

00:03:03.892 --> 00:03:08.260
in fact, those are spikey bullets shot by the tentacles of the Whitespikes

00:03:08.452 --> 00:03:12.484
the name Whitespike is derived from its ashy complexion and spikey bullets 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.932
given that no one survives the last rescue

00:03:15.028 --> 00:03:19.060
Colonel orders Dan to evacuate with the research data and toxin sample 

00:03:19.156 --> 00:03:22.372
just as Dan's unit gets what they need and prepares to leave

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.116
a Whitespike suddenly shows up and kills a female soldier

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.252
Dan commands his soldiers to fire at such grotesque and really scary-looking alien creatures

00:03:31.348 --> 00:03:32.500
but to no avail 

00:03:32.596 --> 00:03:34.372
he then orders them to retreat  

00:03:34.516 --> 00:03:39.076
on their way out, the Whitespikes chase after them and devour a few soldiers

00:03:39.364 --> 00:03:43.492
to ensure the unit's safety, Dan decides to cover them by going last 

00:03:43.588 --> 00:03:47.620
a few seconds later, Dan is attacked by a rampaging Whitespike 

00:03:47.716 --> 00:03:49.396
after firing all of his bullets

00:03:49.444 --> 00:03:53.236
Dan takes out an ax from the fire hydrant cabinet for melee combat

00:03:53.332 --> 00:03:55.828
although the feeble and weak Dan spares no effort

00:03:55.924 --> 00:03:59.476
the vicious tentacled Whitespike keeps gaining the upper hand 

00:03:59.572 --> 00:04:04.372
when he is on the brink of losing his life, Charlie and Dorian come back to rescue him

00:04:04.612 --> 00:04:07.684
Charlie fires a volley of shots at the monster 

00:04:07.828 --> 00:04:11.572
as some bullets hit its belly and neck, the Achille's heel of Whitespikes

00:04:11.668 --> 00:04:14.164
the alien species falls to the ground 

00:04:14.356 --> 00:04:17.860
defeating the Whitespike, Dan's unit finally leaves the lab  

00:04:18.004 --> 00:04:22.228
unfortunately, more of such horrifying monsters clamoring to eat them alive 

00:04:22.324 --> 00:04:24.292
are waiting outside the lab

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.844
in desperation, everyone sprints to the evacuation point

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:32.692
at the pickup point, their car is overturned and its driver devoured by the monsters

00:04:32.788 --> 00:04:35.716
right at the disappointing moment, Colonel informs Dan 

00:04:35.908 --> 00:04:40.132
that his area will be blasted in 3 minutes, and they should go as soon as possible 

00:04:40.324 --> 00:04:44.452
the death toll is rising as they are trying to escape by the skin of their teeth

00:04:44.548 --> 00:04:47.764
however, the horde of Whitespikes are just too overwhelming 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:49.732
when the safe zone is within reach

00:04:49.828 --> 00:04:53.236
some wounded soldiers sacrifice themselves to tackle the beasts 

00:04:53.284 --> 00:04:56.116
so that rest can safely leave with the toxin

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.516
just when Dan steps into the safe zone

00:04:58.612 --> 00:05:02.452
the deafening explosion takes place, knocking him unconscious

00:05:02.596 --> 00:05:06.436
he then wakes up in sickbay, with Charlie and Dorian beside him 

00:05:06.532 --> 00:05:10.420
in this military encampment, Dan extends his appreciation to Colonel 

00:05:10.468 --> 00:05:14.116
and then learns that Colonel is actually the older version of his daughter 

00:05:14.308 --> 00:05:17.140
Colonel reveals that he dies in a car accident 

00:05:17.236 --> 00:05:21.172
but before they can catch up more, they have to execute the next plan  

00:05:21.604 --> 00:05:25.636
Colonel finds a few female Whitespike, which breeds the new baby Whitespikes

00:05:25.876 --> 00:05:28.564
she has tested the reagent in the Whitespike's lair

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:33.028
but only male Whitespikes die, whereas the females are not affected at all 

00:05:33.172 --> 00:05:37.060
so Colonel decides to capture one female Whitespike for further research 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:42.050
according to her plan, Dan's unit is sent to tranquilize and cage the female monster

00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:44.407
and bring it back by helicopter

00:05:44.647 --> 00:05:48.823
upon arrival at the lair, they follow the given guidelines step by step 

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:51.607
once the female Whitespike loses its consciousness

00:05:51.751 --> 00:05:55.543
the soldiers shoot chains into her body and pull her out of the cave 

00:05:55.687 --> 00:05:58.567
however, even though a dozen of strong men work together

00:05:58.663 --> 00:06:00.583
the monster does not move an inch  

00:06:00.775 --> 00:06:04.375
suddenly the female Whitespike rushes out from its cave with an uproar 

00:06:04.423 --> 00:06:06.775
and prowls on the soldiers without mercy 

00:06:06.967 --> 00:06:10.423
due to its swiftness, many soldiers die in an instant

00:06:10.663 --> 00:06:15.367
filled with worries for the soldiers, Colonel descends to the cave to command the battle

00:06:15.511 --> 00:06:19.111
but one careless mistake has put herself in the trap of the Whitespike 

00:06:19.255 --> 00:06:24.535
father's love spurs Dan to jump into the hole at once to deal with the Whitespike's tentacle

00:06:24.679 --> 00:06:27.991
when the beast's movement restrained and its strength deteriorated

00:06:28.135 --> 00:06:30.247
he directs the rest to pull it out 

00:06:30.343 --> 00:06:34.471
finally, the unit manages to cage and load it onto the helicopter 

00:06:34.567 --> 00:06:39.415
however, the gunfire earlier has brought thousands of Whitespikes to besiege them 

00:06:39.607 --> 00:06:44.983
a helicopter that has just taken off is pulled down by the beasts and explodes on the spot

00:06:45.079 --> 00:06:47.025
Dan and Colonel flee with a Humvee

00:06:47.025 --> 00:06:50.839
firing machine guns at the hordes of monsters on top of the vehicle

00:06:51.127 --> 00:06:56.839
their destination is a military base built on the sea, the last military base left on Earth 

00:06:57.031 --> 00:07:01.255
with concerted effort, Colonel and her colleagues come up with a scientific solution 

00:07:01.351 --> 00:07:03.511
that can kill the female Whitespike 

00:07:03.655 --> 00:07:07.495
however, the smidgen of hope of actually wiping out the enemy shatters 

00:07:07.591 --> 00:07:11.143
as an army of Whitespikes conquer the base to rescue the trapped one 

00:07:11.575 --> 00:07:14.455
under the attack, the base is about to collapse soon

00:07:14.695 --> 00:07:18.391
Dan and Colonel hurry to the tarmac while fighting their way out 

00:07:18.535 --> 00:07:23.047
the day marks the last day of Dan's stay, and he will time travel back soon

00:07:23.143 --> 00:07:26.839
when time is so pressing,  Colonel is injured by a spikey bullet 

00:07:27.031 --> 00:07:29.863
with only five minutes left before his departure

00:07:29.959 --> 00:07:33.127
Dan quickly brings Colonel up and prepares to go 

00:07:33.223 --> 00:07:37.735
all of a sudden, the once caged female Whitespike appears before them to seize Colonel 

00:07:37.783 --> 00:07:39.799
and throws her into the sea 

00:07:39.895 --> 00:07:44.119
to save his daughter, Dan holds on to her hand with all his might and strength

00:07:44.311 --> 00:07:48.343
but Colonel lets go of his hand after giving him the toxin solution 

00:07:48.439 --> 00:07:51.559
stricken by grief, Dan jumps down into the sea 

00:07:51.655 --> 00:07:54.055
at the same time, the space tunnel is opened 

00:07:54.151 --> 00:07:57.895
and Dan is transported back along with Charlie and Dorian

00:07:58.135 --> 00:08:01.495
Dan submits the toxin solution to authorities for mass production 

00:08:01.591 --> 00:08:05.143
and sending them to the future to eradicate the Whitespikes  

00:08:05.287 --> 00:08:08.551
much to his shock, nothing can be sent over to the future 

00:08:08.647 --> 00:08:12.727
as the Jump Link technology of the other end is no longer available 

00:08:12.775 --> 00:08:17.143
in other words, human beings in 30 years' future are defeated and doomed

00:08:17.431 --> 00:08:20.551
knowing this, Dan returns home with a heavy heart 

00:08:20.743 --> 00:08:25.879
his wife burst into tears of joy to have him back, but Dan is upset thinking of his daughter

00:08:25.975 --> 00:08:29.719
that night, Dan shares with his wife what he has gone through during the week of duty 

00:08:29.815 --> 00:08:32.119
and his resolution to save their daughter 

00:08:32.263 --> 00:08:33.463
as far as Dan knows

00:08:33.559 --> 00:08:37.591
the Whitespikes first descend on a Russian snow mountain in the year 2048 

00:08:37.735 --> 00:08:41.815
strangely, no photo of a spaceship is captured by satellite in that year 

00:08:41.911 --> 00:08:46.471
this suggests the alien monster might have come to Earth much earlier than the year 2048

00:08:46.567 --> 00:08:49.879
with this clue, Dan carries out his investigation 

00:08:50.023 --> 00:08:52.423
he contacts Charlie and Dorian for help 

00:08:52.471 --> 00:08:57.031
and realizes Charlie has only a few months to live due to her terminal cancer

00:08:57.175 --> 00:09:01.275
Charlie gives Dan a spikey bullet picked up from the future battlefield 

00:09:01.639 --> 00:09:04.900
by extraction, they discover volcanic ash from the spike

00:09:05.143 --> 00:09:08.407
which means the Whitespikes have been buried deep down the ground 

00:09:08.455 --> 00:09:12.631
the volcanic ash finally unravels that Whitespikes have reached the Earth 

00:09:12.679 --> 00:09:14.695
by spaceship hundreds of years ago 

00:09:14.743 --> 00:09:18.823
as their arrival coincides with a volcanic eruption in Northern Russia

00:09:18.967 --> 00:09:22.327
they are buried deep underground by volcanic ash and snow 

00:09:22.471 --> 00:09:26.455
centuries later, global warming has thawed the ice glaciers in Northern Russia 

00:09:26.551 --> 00:09:29.143
and therefore freed Whitespikes' shackles 

00:09:29.396 --> 00:09:32.948
Dan seeks official permission to destroy the Whitespikes in Russia

00:09:33.044 --> 00:09:37.844
but the nation refuses to support such a cause as no concrete evidence is provided 

00:09:38.036 --> 00:09:42.884
moreover, political as Russia and the United States are not on good terms

00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:46.676
Dan turns to his estranged father (Grandpa), an ex-piolet for help 

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:51.092
when Grandpa knows that the trip to save his granddaughter, he agrees right away 

00:09:51.284 --> 00:09:55.028
on top of that, Dan manages to get the toxin solution mass-produced 

00:09:55.124 --> 00:09:57.860
with the help of a female time-traveler soldier 

00:09:58.004 --> 00:10:01.268
she fully supports the drive and offers bombs for the battle

00:10:01.364 --> 00:10:05.743
so Dan forms his special force with Grandpa, Charlie, Dorian 

00:10:05.743 --> 00:10:07.663
and a few surviving future soldiers 

00:10:07.663 --> 00:10:11.475
Grandpa flies his private jet, dodging the Russian satellite system 

00:10:11.647 --> 00:10:15.103
all the way to the Academy of Sciences Glacier on Komsomolets Island 

00:10:15.199 --> 00:10:18.319
according to the changes in the magnetic field and heat source

00:10:18.415 --> 00:10:21.391
Dan ascertains the location of the alien spaceship

00:10:21.487 --> 00:10:25.903
then they blast open the ice and find a cave in which the spacecraft stays 

00:10:26.335 --> 00:10:29.695
Dan cuts through the spacecraft and walks in with Charlie 

00:10:29.791 --> 00:10:32.671
while Grandpa and Dorian are on guard outside 

00:10:32.815 --> 00:10:37.999
inside the ship, Dan finds what looks like an alien's body and a Whitespike incubator 

00:10:37.999 --> 00:10:41.125
this goes to reveal that Whitespikes are invading weapons 

00:10:41.125 --> 00:10:43.999
developed by aliens to destroy another planet 

00:10:44.095 --> 00:10:48.943
Dan and Charlie inject Whitespikes with the toxin reagent while they are still in eggs 

00:10:49.135 --> 00:10:54.127
with one shot, each of the monsters turns into a pool of blood after struggling for a while

00:10:54.271 --> 00:10:56.527
before they give the other Whitespikes a dose

00:10:56.671 --> 00:11:00.511
the Whitespikes become so irritated that they rush out from the containers

00:11:00.655 --> 00:11:05.455
as the situation turns complicated, Charlie asks to let him handle the beasts alone

00:11:05.599 --> 00:11:09.967
after Dan leaves, Charlie blows up the spacecraft with the bombs he has 

00:11:10.111 --> 00:11:12.511
joining forces with Grandpa and Dorian

00:11:12.511 --> 00:11:16.399
Dan soon learns that the blast kills all Whitespikes except one 

00:11:16.495 --> 00:11:19.951
to prevent this particular Whitespike from breeding more descendants

00:11:19.999 --> 00:11:23.215
Dan and Grandpa decide to hunt it down and kill it 

00:11:23.503 --> 00:11:28.399
shortly after, they track it all the way and finally succeed in sandwiching the monster

00:11:28.591 --> 00:11:29.695
the beast recoils 

00:11:29.743 --> 00:11:33.631
as they riddle the Whitespike with countless bullets from its front and back

00:11:33.679 --> 00:11:37.903
unexpectedly, a white mist begins to gather around the Whitespike 

00:11:37.951 --> 00:11:40.927
and mysteriously, it vanishes in the mist 

00:11:41.071 --> 00:11:44.575
for better defense, Dan and Grandpa stand back to back

00:11:44.767 --> 00:11:47.791
out of thin air, the monster emerges from the white fog

00:11:47.839 --> 00:11:50.047
disarranging the two men's formation

00:11:50.143 --> 00:11:54.079
in the blink of an eye, Dan is shot down by a spikey bullet 

00:11:54.223 --> 00:11:56.335
as the Whitespike roams over to him quickly

00:11:56.431 --> 00:12:00.655
Dan plucks out the bullet from his leg and stabs it into the beast's eye

00:12:00.751 --> 00:12:04.159
shortly after that, Grandpa hits its another eye with a pickaxe

00:12:04.303 --> 00:12:09.103
the madly blind Whitespike kicks Grandpa away and shoots spikes everywhere

00:12:09.199 --> 00:12:12.943
Dan seizes this chance to inject the monster's claw with toxin 

00:12:12.991 --> 00:12:17.167
but to his surprise, the Whitespike bites off its own claw for survival 

00:12:17.311 --> 00:12:20.383
as a last resort, Dan climbs to the edge of the cliff

00:12:20.527 --> 00:12:23.743
intending to use himself as bait to entice the enemy 

00:12:23.887 --> 00:12:28.015
but Grandpa cuts his own palm to lure the Whitespike with his own blood 

00:12:28.159 --> 00:12:31.759
Grandpa's sacrifice attempt empowers Dan to ride on the Whitespike 

00:12:31.855 --> 00:12:36.079
and cut through its neck before giving a deadly toxin shot into its brain 

00:12:36.175 --> 00:12:40.639
without further ado, Dan kicks the very last Whitespike down the cliff  

00:12:41.359 --> 00:12:45.151
in the final scene, Dan and Grandpa reunite with the family 

00:12:45.295 --> 00:12:49.759
when Dan's daughter hugs him, he feels so accomplished that he has done the right thing

00:12:50.527 --> 00:12:53.551
this's Daniel CC movie channel, peace out
