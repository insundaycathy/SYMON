00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.170
Welcome to Moviecaps.

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:07.520
Today I will show you a Drama, Sci-fi, Thriller
Black Mirror episode from 2011, titled The

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.549
Entire History of You.

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:11.260
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:12.980
Watch out and take care.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:14.839
Liam is at a job appraisal.

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:18.530
He is questioned whether everything is going
fine and he reassures them.

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:22.060
He gets in a cab where an ad is playing on
a transparent screen.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.050
He isn't sure how the appraisal went, so he
pulls out a tiny remote and watches it back

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.340
multiple times, paying attention to their
expressions and everything they say.

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.870
A device behind his ear called “Grain”
is projecting the memory straight to his eyes

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.499
in greater detail.

00:00:35.499 --> 00:00:39.769
As he is boarding a flight, he is asked by
security to rewind his last week.

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:44.329
The computer checks every person he has interacted
with and he is cleared for the flight.

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:48.179
His wife Ffion is at a dinner party where
Jeff is watching back a memory from his stay

00:00:48.179 --> 00:00:50.109
at a 5 star hotel.

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:53.120
He says the memory is ruined because of a
frayed carpet.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.640
Liam arrives and is welcomed in by Lucy.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.139
They make small talk and she hands him a drink.

00:00:58.139 --> 00:01:01.550
As he goes into a room he sees his wife talking
to someone.

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.410
She comes up and says he's arrived early and
asks how the appraisal went.

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:07.850
Jonas walks up and introduces himself.

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.440
The guests ask Liam about the appraisal and
he says he's not sure how it went, so they

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.190
try to pressure him into watching it together.

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.620
Jonas points out how he is uncomfortable,
so they should drop it.

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:22.470
As everyone heads for dinner, Liam stays back
and replays what he saw as he walked in.

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.290
Lucy brings in a new guest- Hallam.

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.140
They're having dinner and discussing relationships.

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.270
Jonas thinks that staying with 1 person for
an extended period of time is boring.

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.550
He also mentions that even if he's in a relationship,
he keeps watching re do’s of earlier hot

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.740
times and says that everyone else probably
does it too.

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.180
Lucy informs everyone that Hallam doesn't
have a grain.

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.080
Everyone is taken aback by this and she explains
that a year ago someone assaulted her and

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.000
gauged her Grain out, apparently to sell it
to some millionaire perv.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.770
After not having it for a few days she kinda
liked it.

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.641
One of the guests points out that actual memories
aren't reliable and can be influenced, so

00:01:57.641 --> 00:01:59.730
she couldn't go grainless.

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:04.080
Liam and Ffion are driving home in a cab and
watch back his job appraisal, trying to make

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.280
sense of it.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.990
She points out how one of the interviewers
drew a tick which must be a good sign, but

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:12.330
Liam isn't convinced stating that they were
huge pricks.

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.080
Later Liam points out that Ffion laughed at
every joke Jonas said.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.340
They arrive home and offer the babysitter
to stay the night because she would have to

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.020
wait 40 minutes for a cab otherwise.

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.100
After she goes up to a spare bedroom they
watch back the day through their kids eyes.

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.950
Liam questions his wifes interactions with
Jonas.

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.020
She says they only dated for a month, years
ago.

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.480
He says that previously she said they dated
for only a week, which she denies so he pulls

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.680
up a memory where she says it was a week catching
her in a lie.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.350
Later, as they are making love, they are watching
back a memory of a more exciting time.

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:48.560
After she falls asleep, he pours himself a
drink and stays up late watching back everything

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.610
Jonas said and her response.

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.560
He uses lipreading reconstruction to see what
Ffion and Jonas were saying when he walked

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:55.690
in.

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.400
The babysitter wakes up and Liam asks her
whether a joke Jonas said that only Ffion

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.780
laughed at is funny.

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:06.000
Ffion comes down and Liam tries to push the
babysitter for a response, making her uncomfortable.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.370
Fion is embarrassed and apologizes to the
babysitter and leads her out.

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.410
Ffion is frustrated but Liam asks her to sit
down and just keeps playing clips from her

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.270
interactions with Jonas.

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:20.020
He points out that she gets stiff around him,
but not with Jonas.

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.690
He is becoming obsessed and keeps questioning
her.

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.650
Ffion admits that they actually went out for
6 months and says she downplayed it, because

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.220
it happened years ago.

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.220
Liam says that it wasn't years ago for Jonas
and shows her the part where Jonas talks about

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.390
watching back the hot parts of his earlier
relationships.

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.310
She tells him to sober up and leaves in frustration.

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.120
He keeps drinking while watching the same
clips.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.840
A bit later he gets in his car, which warns
him that he shouldn't be driving in his condition.

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.790
He dismisses the warning, shows up at Jonas'
place and lets himself in.

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.530
Liam grabs a bottle and starts drinking.

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.170
Jonas says it's not cool for him to walk in
like this and ask whether he needs to call

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:57.310
Ffion.

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.780
Hallam walks in and after Liam makes an inappropriate
joke, she says he should leave.

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.500
He takes another sip, comments on the nice
room and asks if this is where he wanks to

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:06.580
his wife.

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:10.690
Now Jonas also asks him to leave and, as he
tries to get him out, Liam hits him in the

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.590
head with the bottle.

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:17.010
Jonas wakes up in his car that's crashed into
a tree with no memories of what happened after.

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:20.820
He rewinds to see Hallam panicking and calling
the police while he wrestles Jonas on the

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.660
ground while screaming for him to delete every
interaction with Ffion from his timeline.

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.430
When this doesn't work he breaks the bottle
and threatens to slice his neck.

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:33.400
Jonas deletes them all and Liam finally leaves
while screaming at Jonas to stay away from

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.500
his house.

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.050
He comes out of the memory, stunned at what
he's capable of.

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:42.639
He goes back home, wakes up his wife and asks
her whether he is their daughter's father.

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:46.130
Ffion acts confused so he pulls up his interaction
with Jonas.

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:49.350
“Christ, what have you done?” she whispers.

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:52.990
He fast forwards to where all of Jonas’
memories with Ffion can be seen and zooms

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:57.630
in on the most recent one, 18 months ago,
when she was already with Liam.

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.280
Their bedroom painting can be seen in the
background.

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.540
Tears start forming in her eyes.

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:06.440
She says she's sorry and that it happened
when Liam had walked out for 5 days, without

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:08.780
even calling her and that she was drunk.

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:12.840
He asks whether they used protection and when
she says they did he asks her to show him.

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:17.660
She says she deleted it but he keeps pushing
her to show the blank gap in her timeline.

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:21.020
She tries to delete it without him watching
but he stops her and forces her to put it

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:22.430
on a screen.

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:26.760
She has no choice because he starts getting
aggressive so she plays it back to him.

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.310
She hides her face while he watches the whole
thing.

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:31.850
Ffion and the painting are gone.

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:35.250
Liam is laying in bed, replaying memories
of their daughter.

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:38.930
As he walks through the house, he reminisces
of the good times they had together when they

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:40.110
were happy.

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:43.060
He's in front of a bathroom mirror, contemplating.

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:46.180
He makes a cut behind his ear and takes the
Grain out.

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:47.380
The End.

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:48.979
Thank you for watching!
