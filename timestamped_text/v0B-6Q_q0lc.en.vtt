00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:04.640
Hey Guys, welcome to our movie recap channel.
Today we will be watching the movie “That’s

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.480
My Boy”. So, please turn on the subtitles
and spoilers ahead.

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:13.379
The movie starts in 1984 at a school. We see
Donny, a teenager who is quite popular in

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:18.710
his school. His friends start talking to him
about girls. But Donny seems uninterested.

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.230
He tells his friends that he is no longer
interested in girls of his age. He wants real

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.619
women. Then, we see the hot teacher of his
school. Every guy in the school is attracted

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:30.160
by her beauty. Her name is Mary.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.170
Donny has two concert tickets. So, he asks
Mary if she wants to join him. Mary tells

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:40.130
him that she isn’t his girlfriend, and asking
teachers to go on a date is completely inappropriate.

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:44.610
But Donny doesn’t stop flirting with her.
So, Mary gives him a month’s detention.

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.230
In the detention room, Mary starts to seduce
Donny. She tells him that she was really aroused

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.210
by him. Donny doesn’t know if all this is
real. Then, Mary takes Donny to her office

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.700
and their affair starts. Their affair goes
on for quite a long time. They even start

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.460
meeting outside the school.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.480
Then one day, there is a school program going
on in the auditorium. Suddenly, the whole

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:09.200
school starts to hear something. To answer
their curiosity, they open the curtains, and

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.470
find Donny and Mary together. The whole school
gets in shock of what they had seen. Mary

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.970
runs away in shame. But, Donny gets cheers
from the whole school, and he even enjoys

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:18.970
it.

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.909
Mary is taken to court for having a sexual
relationship with her student. At the court,

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:27.340
people find out that Mary is actually pregnant
with Donny’s child. Mary gets a 30 years

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.570
jail sentence, but Donny, on the other hand,
becomes a celebrity for impregnating his teacher.

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.470
Many news channels take his interview, and
he gets invited to many shows, which earns

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:37.670
him a lot of money.

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.770
28 years later, everything takes a turn in
Donny’s life. Donny has become an alcoholic,

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.920
and he has spent all the money he earned from
the fame he got from impregnating Mary. His

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.659
friend tells him that he hasn’t paid any
taxes in years. He owed exactly 43,000 dollars

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.960
to the government. And if he doesn’t pay
it, he will go to jail.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.190
But, Donny has no money left. He only has
20 dollars to his name. His friends suggests

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.060
that he should bet that money on a fat guy
who was going to run a marathon. The betting

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.840
odds of that fat guy winning was 8000 to 1.
Donny thinks he has nothing to lose and bets

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:09.840
the money.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.890
His friend asks him if he can get the money
from his son. But Donny reveals that his son

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.380
left him after he had turned 18. And since
then, they haven’t talked to each other.

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.340
This is the son that came after Mary’s pregnancy.
He named him Han Solo.

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.349
Now, we see Han Solo. But he has changed his
name to Todd. He has a beautiful girlfriend

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:31.349
named Jamie, and is soon going to get married
to her. The news of his marriage is in the

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:35.969
newspapers and Donny soon finds out about
it. He gets surprised to see his son lose

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:40.749
weight and change his name. He also finds
out that his son is now rich. After he left

00:02:40.749 --> 00:02:45.209
Donny, Todd has kept information about his
parents a secret. So, he told the media that

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.629
his parents died in an accident. Donny is
furious to find out about all this.

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:54.019
Todd takes his girlfriend’s parents to his
boss’ house. His boss was letting them stay

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:58.060
there until the wedding. At the house, he
also gets to meet Jamie’s brother who is

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.599
a soldier. His name is Chad, and he warns
Todd about not hurting his sister.

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:07.169
Meanwhile, Donny goes to Vanilla Ice, who
was his friend, to get help about the money.

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:11.769
But Vanilla Ice doesn’t want to help him,
because Donny had slept with his mother. So,

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:13.059
Ice attacks Donny.

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:17.730
Later, he goes to a TV producer, and asks
him for his help. But, the producer says that

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.239
he cannot help him, and people no longer were
interested in him. So, Donny says that what

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:26.389
if they interview him and Mary, who was soon
going to get released from jail. The producer

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:31.209
seems interested, but he wants more. He asks
Donny about his son, and Donny replies that

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:35.349
Todd was very successful and rich.
Hearing this, the producer tells Donny that

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:39.049
if he brings his son and gets an interview
with him and Mary together, then he will give

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:41.019
him 50 thousand dollars.

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:45.390
Donny thinks about the money and immediately
goes to meet Todd. Donny goes to his house,

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.959
and gets to meet Jamie. He enters the house,
and Todd is surprised to see him there. Todd

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:54.739
gets nervous and introduces Donny as his friend,
and not a father. Todd starts to make things

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:59.260
up to make it seem like Donny is his friend.
Donny plays along with him, and makes up strange

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.639
stories. And everyone believes him.

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:05.699
Todd says that Donny should leave, but everyone
wants him to stay for the wedding, and Donny

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:10.230
gets to stay there. Later, Todd is mad at
Donny and asks him why he was there. Donny

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.239
doesn’t tell him about the interview. So
he lies that his mother was really sick and

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:18.509
he needs to see her before the surgery. Todd
doesn't believe him at all. They start to

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:22.759
get into an argument. Donny believes that
he was a great father, but Todd says that

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:25.040
Donny was the worst parent in the world.

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.319
Just then, Jamie calls Todd about the cocktail
party. And Todd wants Donny to wear a tie

00:04:29.319 --> 00:04:33.539
for the party, but Donny says that it was
not his thing. However, he agrees to do it

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:36.430
after Todd says that he will give him 100
dollars.

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:41.259
At the party, Donny shows up wearing a tie,
but he has no pants on. Jamie introduces Donny

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:45.590
to Todd’s boss, and they get along quickly.
Donny impresses everyone at the party with

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:50.389
his fake stories. And one of the guests recognizes
him as the student that got his teacher pregnant.

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:55.370
Todd’s boss then also recognizes him and
asks him about the son he had with his teacher.

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.301
Donny says that his son grew to be a very
rude person, as he looks at Todd. Everyone

00:04:59.301 --> 00:05:02.160
at the party knew Donny but no one knew that
Todd was his son.

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.919
Todd’s co-worker who is also the best man
for the wedding says that since Donny and

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:10.300
Todd are close friends, he should no longer
be the best man. He says that Donny should

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:14.729
be the Best Man at Todd’s wedding. Todd
says that it is not necessary, but Donny quickly

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:16.289
accepts the offer.

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:21.110
After that, Donny proposes to play a game
of baseball. Everyone is excited at this idea,

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:25.150
except for Todd. Everyone in the field seems
great at the sport, even the grand ma and

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:30.229
a little kid. But Todd is not athletic. Donny
bats the ball towards Todd, who fails to catch

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:32.960
it. Everyone thinks that Todd is a loser.

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:36.990
That night, Jamie tells Todd about Donny's
book. Donny had written a book with a message

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:41.710
that he loved his son. Todd gets emotional
after seeing this. He also wants to sleep

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:44.659
with Jamie, but she doesn’t want to ruin
the dress.

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:48.970
Next day, Jamie’s friends take her to the
bachelorette party. Donny asks if Todd has

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:53.629
a bachelor party or not. Todd’s friend says
he has arranged everything. But, Donny isn’t

00:05:53.629 --> 00:05:57.629
too happy when he finds out the bachelor party
included a spa treatment.

00:05:57.629 --> 00:06:01.801
He thinks this is the worst bachelor party.
He tells everyone that they should go to a

00:06:01.801 --> 00:06:04.169
strip club. And they all follow him.

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:08.080
All of them have a fun night at the strip
club. Todd too seems to be having fun at his

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:12.880
bachelors party. Donny sends everyone off
to the house. And he keeps Todd with him,

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.270
as he wants to spend more time with him.

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:19.569
Donny gives Todd the ear ring of his mother
as a wedding gift. Todd seems happy, but he

00:06:19.569 --> 00:06:24.020
doesn’t have a pierced ear. So, Donny pierces
his ear and puts the ear ring on Todd’s

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:25.020
ear.

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:28.680
Donny tells Todd that they should meet Uncle
Vinny. And Todd is surprised to find out that

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.479
Uncle Vinny was none other than Vanilla Ice
himself.

00:06:31.479 --> 00:06:35.889
The three of them get wasted that night and
make quite more friends. Todd is really happy

00:06:35.889 --> 00:06:39.940
and is enjoying the night very much. At the
end of it, Todd says that he will go visit

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:44.380
his mother in the jail. Donny realizes that
he shouldn't use his son for money. They spent

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:49.011
a very special night together and their bond
seems to be growing. So, Donny doesn’t want

00:06:49.011 --> 00:06:54.060
to risk it for money. Donny tells Todd that
his mother was lying about being sick. So,

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:55.889
he doesn’t have to go visit her.

00:06:55.889 --> 00:07:00.599
The two of them hug and go to sleep. Donny
finds Todd’s boss’ mother in his room.

00:07:00.599 --> 00:07:02.960
And Todd goes on to make out with a mannequin.

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:07.690
Next morning. Jamie finds that Todd had puked
all over her dress. She says that there’s

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:11.789
something else on her dress. She tastes it
and finds out that Todd tried to have sex

00:07:11.789 --> 00:07:17.099
with her dress. Donny, hearing this, is proud
of Todd. But Jamie demands that Todd fixes

00:07:17.099 --> 00:07:18.750
the dress before their wedding.

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:22.590
So, Todd goes to get dry cleaning and calls
Donny to let him know that he was going to

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:27.479
meet his mother. Donny tries to stop him,
but Todd says that he wants to meet his mother.

00:07:27.479 --> 00:07:31.249
Donny hurries up to go to the jail before
Todd, to not let him know about the interview,

00:07:31.249 --> 00:07:33.889
which was going to pay him 50,000 dollars.

00:07:33.889 --> 00:07:37.930
Donny reaches the jail and finds Todd waiting
to meet his mother. Donny tells Todd that

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:42.520
he shouldn’t be wasting time before his
wedding. But, Mary shows up. She is older

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:44.400
but she hasn’t changed one bit.

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:48.699
Mary is happy to see both Donny and Todd.
Todd too seems happy by seeing his mother

00:07:48.699 --> 00:07:52.970
after a long time. Donny is mesmerized to
see Mary, and they both get a little nasty

00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:56.370
through the phone. Todd is obviously disgusted
by them.

00:07:56.370 --> 00:08:00.909
Just then, the TV producer comes to them with
a camera and starts asking questions to Todd.

00:08:00.909 --> 00:08:04.860
He realizes that Donny came back to his life
to get this interview, so he could get some

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:07.680
money. Todd gets angry and leaves Donny.

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:11.819
Donny realizes that he made a mistake by coming
back to Todd’s life. He prepares to leave

00:08:11.819 --> 00:08:16.290
the house, but he overhears Jamie talking
to Steve, Todd’s boss. Jamie was saying

00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:21.479
that Todd will never find out. Donny realizes
that Jamie is cheating on Todd with his boss.

00:08:21.479 --> 00:08:25.939
At the wedding rehearsal. Donny goes to Todd
to tell him about everything. Todd doesn’t

00:08:25.939 --> 00:08:30.400
want to listen to anything he says. But, Donny
tells him about the affair between his boss

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:31.400
and Jamie.

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:35.270
Jamie comes forward and tells everyone that
she was planning a surprise for Todd, and

00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:39.650
didn’t want him to find out. She says that
Donny heard the conversation, and misjudged

00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:40.650
everything.

00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:44.570
Donny realizes that he made a mistake, so
he gets out of there. After the rehearsal,

00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:48.700
Jamie and her brother go together in a car,
leaving their parents and Todd alone.

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:53.010
Donny watches Todd from afar, and thinks about
how he can make things right between them.

00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:57.910
His friend suggests that he should first apologize
to Jamie. So, Donny gets two ice creams and

00:08:57.910 --> 00:09:03.110
goes to apologize to Jamie. But outside her
room, he hears Jamie having sex with someone.

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:07.120
Todd was obviously left behind. So, who was
she sleeping with.

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:11.500
Donny breaks into her room, and catches Jamie
cheating on Todd. And pretty soon, he sees

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:15.290
that the man Jamie was sleeping with was none
other than Chad, her brother.

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:20.010
Seeing this, Donny is shocked. He feels disgusted
by the incestuous relationship between Jamie

00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:23.850
and Chad. He clicks a picture of them and
says that he will tell everything to Todd.

00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:28.310
But, Jamie offers him money. Jamie says that
she will give him the money he needs, if he

00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:32.810
shuts up and tells nothing to Todd. Donny
is desperate and he accepts the money.

00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:36.970
Next day, Donny sits in his house ashamed
of what he has done. But, he realizes that

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:42.330
he still has time before the wedding. So,
he goes to Vanilla Ice, and asks for his car.

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:46.380
Vanilla Ice and Donny ride together pretty
roughly to crash Todd’s wedding. At the

00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:50.310
wedding, the vows have been taken, and Todd
is going to accept the marriage.

00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:54.470
Donny reaches the wedding just at time, and
stops everything. Todd is embarrassed to see

00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:59.030
Donny ruin his wedding. Donny points at Jamie,
and says that he cannot allow his son to marry

00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:00.300
such a woman.

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:04.710
Donny calls Todd his son in front of everyone.
Jamie is disgusted to find out that Todd was

00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:09.140
the child of a sexual relationship between
a teacher and a student. Donny calls her out

00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:14.070
for cheating on Todd. Jamie obviously refuses
the accusation, But, Donny shows everyone

00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:17.980
the cheque that Jamie had given to him to
shut up about everything. Donny even tears

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:21.030
the cheque to prove that his son was more
important than the money.

00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:25.030
Jamie tells Todd about her sleeping with Chad,
and says that they should get married anyway,

00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:29.060
because they both weren’t perfect. But,
Todd is just disgusted to find out that Jamie

00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:33.280
was sleeping with her brother. He tells everyone
at the wedding about the relationship between

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:38.120
Chad and Jamie, and needless to say, everyone
is disgusted as well. Chad blames everything

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:40.100
on Jamie, and leaves from there.

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:44.970
Jamie apologizes to Todd and asks him to accept
her. Todd looks at his dad and Vanilla Ice,

00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:50.000
who both are shaking their heads. Todd finally
realizes his worth, and says No to Jamie.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.830
He cancels the wedding, and then proudly tells
everyone that his dad was Donny.

00:10:53.830 --> 00:10:58.120
Todd then tells his boss that he is quitting
the job. Vanilla Ice then tells Todd that

00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:02.850
his boss was also sleeping with Jamie. His
boss tries to deny it. But Todd tells him

00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:07.210
that Vanilla Ice and Donny had slept with
his mother, so he doesn’t feel that bad.

00:11:07.210 --> 00:11:09.420
Todd then leaves the wedding with his father.

00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:13.190
Todd is now happy with Donny, and says that
he wants to pay the money to save him from

00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:18.100
going to jail. But, Donny says that he should
be responsible for his own actions, and doesn’t

00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:19.640
want money from his son.

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:23.770
Just then, Donny’s friend comes to them,
and turns on the TV. The fat guy that Donny

00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:28.100
bet 20 dollars on was doing pretty good in
the marathon. Donny seems to have a chance

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:32.580
of winning the bet. The fat guy passes every
runner in front of him, and unexpectedly wins

00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:38.600
the race. And with that, Donny wins 160,000
dollars from the 20 dollars he bet. In the

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:42.660
end, Donny doesn’t have to go to jail. Everyone
cheers and the movie ends.

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:44.900
