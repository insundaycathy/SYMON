00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:13.200
Hi guys, Korean Movie Recapped here. Before&nbsp;
we start, WARNING! Spoilers Ahead! Today, I’m&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:19.520
going to recap a 2003 Korean Crime Thriller movie,&nbsp;
called Memories of Murder. This movie is loosely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:25.360
based on the true story of South Korea's first&nbsp;
confirmed serial murders in 1986, in Hwaseong&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:33.200
city. Due to the notoriety of the case, 2 million&nbsp;
officers were mobilized. 40,116 individuals were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:40.400
investigated and 21,280 turned into suspects at&nbsp;
that time. So, who did the culprit kill? What was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:46.400
the motive behind the killings? Let’s find it out.
The movie starts with local detective Park,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.600
investigating a crime scene. In the sewer, he&nbsp;
finds a woman’s corpse with hands tied behind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.600
her back. Nearby, the kids play with the evidence&nbsp;
which is the victim’s clothings. The next day,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.880
Park starts to interrogate people who have been&nbsp;
close to the victim. However, before solving the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:07.040
first murder, he is called to another crime&nbsp;
scene where another woman becomes the victim.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.960
Her hands are tied behind the back, her underwear&nbsp;
cover her face and gag her mouth. He is mad&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.120
because the forensics team hasn’t arrived and&nbsp;
the crime scene has already been destroyed by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:22.320
the villagers who are curious about the incident.
While he is at home, his Wife says that there is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.360
a mentally handicapped boy named Baek who likes&nbsp;
to lurk around women. He also lurked around the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.160
last victim before her death. Park immediately&nbsp;
goes to the boy’s house to interrogate him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:38.240
He tries to provoke Baek by talking about his&nbsp;
liking towards women. Frustrated by Baek’s denial,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.920
Park invites his partner Cho who immediately kicks&nbsp;
him down and beats him. In the morning, Seo joins&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.720
the team to uncover the case. He voluntarily&nbsp;
comes down from Seoul to find the culprit.&nbsp;

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.320
During interrogation, Park and Cho continue to&nbsp;
corner Baek for confession by threatening him to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.680
bury the boy alive, if he still doesn’t want to&nbsp;
confess. When Park is talking about the victim,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.800
Baek suddenly explains how the woman was killed.&nbsp;
Even though the team has gotten Baek’s confession,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:10.400
Seo is still unconvinced and continues to study&nbsp;
the case’s documents. Having successfully caught&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:14.880
the culprit, Park, Cho, and the Chief try to&nbsp;
remake the crime scene with the reporters’&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:20.480
coverage, to boost their popularity. However,&nbsp;
Seo realizes that Baek’s hands are flawed and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.040
cannot do such actions, especially tying&nbsp;
rope knots around the victims’ hands.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.520
Despite the finding, the team still tries to&nbsp;
frame Baek but is thwarted by the villagers.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.600
The villagers wreak havoc during the&nbsp;
remake and Baek is forcibly released.&nbsp;

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.880
After losing the case, the Chief is reassigned&nbsp;
to another case and a new Chief shows up.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:45.120
On the first day, the new Chief asks Park about&nbsp;
the investigation’s update. Still unsatisfied with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.240
the information, the Chief visits the first crime&nbsp;
scene and Seo adds that the perpetrator only acts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:55.440
in the rain and only targets red-dressed women.&nbsp;
He also adds that he found a missing person report&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.400
that matches the crime’s traits, and believes that&nbsp;
there is a third victim that is yet to be found.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:06.320
Park denies the hypothesis but the Chief believes&nbsp;
Seo. With Seo’s leads, the team scopes through the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:11.200
location and finds the corpse. They are further&nbsp;
convinced that the third victim fell to the same&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.240
culprit since the features are present. Her hands&nbsp;
are tied behind her back with the same knot, her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.720
face is covered by her underwear, and the culprit&nbsp;
used her underwear to strangle her to death.&nbsp;

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.760
Knowing the traits, they decide to bait&nbsp;
the perpetrator. A woman is dressed in red&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.880
and tasked to walk in the rain. However,&nbsp;
the culprit ignores the bait. Meanwhile,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.240
a woman is walking in the rain when&nbsp;
she suddenly hears a strange whistle.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.200
Afraid of the past incidents, she tries&nbsp;
to run away but is caught by the culprit.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.280
Even though she was not wearing a red dress,&nbsp;
the detectives conclude that the crime is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.840
done by the same perpetrator since all the&nbsp;
other traits are present. In the office,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.720
a crew uncovers another characteristic where a&nbsp;
certain Song is always played on a radio station,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.960
when the killings happen. The team rushes&nbsp;
to the station to track the origin,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:02.400
but the radio crew has dumped the request letters.
In the night, they decide to revisit the latest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.840
scene to look for more leads. There, they find a&nbsp;
man trying to fantasize with women's underwear.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.440
The man admits that he just fantasizes&nbsp;
things and hasn't done any crime.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.400
In the office, they continue to force him into&nbsp;
confession despite the villagers' protest.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:21.440
The man ridicules the initiative by adding&nbsp;
more to the story. He adds that there is a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:26.800
crazy person who lives in a school’s restroom.&nbsp;
Seo decides to look more into the story, so he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:32.080
visits the school’s restroom in question. There,&nbsp;
he meets a teacher who says that the suspected&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:37.840
person is supposedly living in an outhouse nearby.&nbsp;
In the outhouse, the crew finds that the suspect&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.480
is actually a woman who is also a victim but&nbsp;
survived. She doesn’t remember the culprit’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:47.760
face but remembers that the culprit’s palms are&nbsp;
soft like a woman’s. In the office, Seo checks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:52.480
the previous suspect’s palms and finds that his&nbsp;
hands are rough, unlike the victim’s description.&nbsp;

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.520
Seo forces Park to release the suspect but they&nbsp;
fight due to the difference in their belief.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.960
Suddenly, the Song which is also the perpetrator’s&nbsp;
trait is played on the radio amid the rain.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.360
Seo tries to ask the radio crew about&nbsp;
the song request but is turned down.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:12.400
They try to request the policemen to do a search&nbsp;
but are denied due to the riots in other cities.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:18.320
The next day, a woman is found dead in a field&nbsp;
and is brought to the autopsy room. There,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:23.120
they find peach fruit inside the woman’s private&nbsp;
part, which is a new characteristic to the crime.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:27.760
Still clueless about the perpetrator, the&nbsp;
team felt disappointed by their failure.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:34.000
Fortunately, a radio crew calls them and says&nbsp;
that they’ve found the request letter. Turns out,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.360
the requestor is Hyeon, who is a factory worker.&nbsp;
They rush to Hyeon’s house only to find his mother&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:44.320
who tells them that Hyeon is working in the&nbsp;
factory. Hyeon is determined as another suspect&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:49.680
and is interrogated by the team. Seo finds that&nbsp;
Hyeon’s palms are soft just like the surviving&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:54.720
victim says. They also find that he started to&nbsp;
live in the village around September, the same as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.720 --> 00:06:00.720
when the killings started. He also admits that he&nbsp;
requests the Song everytime rain falls. Moreover,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:04.880
he also forgot about the last song that was played&nbsp;
even though claiming that he didn’t leave the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:10.720
house last night. As the crew desperately accuses&nbsp;
Hyeon, he breaks and the situation intensifies.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.440
Cho kicks him in the chest and the Chief prohibits&nbsp;
him from entering the interrogation room.&nbsp;

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:20.560
When replaying the previous suspects’&nbsp;
interrogation tapes, they realize that Baek’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:25.120
story is actually a description when he witnessed&nbsp;
the killing. Baek witnessed the perpetrator’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:30.000
action while he was following the second victim.&nbsp;
With the new lead, they visit Baek’s house to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.440
look for him. But they find Cho instead. Cho&nbsp;
is down after being scolded by the Chief,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:39.680
and takes it out on the customers who are dissing&nbsp;
the detectives’ effort in capturing the culprit.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:44.400
When Baek comes home, he tries to join&nbsp;
the fight but punctures Cho’s leg instead.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:50.400
He runs away but is caught by Park and Seo. When&nbsp;
he is asked about the culprit’s face, his father&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:55.600
comes to rescue him. In the panic, Baek runs&nbsp;
away but crashes into a running train and dies.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:59.280
Without any strong evidence,&nbsp;
Hyeon is finally dismissed.&nbsp;

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:05.360
The team is once again left without any leads.&nbsp;
Luckily, another team finds the culprit’s semen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:10.960
on one of the victims’ corpses. The sample&nbsp;
will be used for DNA matching with Hyeon’s DNA.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:15.920
However, the test can only be carried out in&nbsp;
America since they don’t have the technology.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:21.520
While waiting for the result, Seo continues to&nbsp;
stalk Hyeon for more leads. However, when Hyeon&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:26.640
is leaving on a bus, Seo’s car cannot start&nbsp;
and he fails to follow him. The next morning,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:32.000
another victim is found by the police. A pen and&nbsp;
a spoon is stuck inside the victim’s private part.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:37.920
Seeing this, Seo regrets the situation deeply&nbsp;
since the victim is a teenage girl who he knows,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:42.880
and he could’ve prevented the killing if his car&nbsp;
worked properly. Seo is enraged and beats Hyeon&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:47.920
to make up for his regret. When he is about to&nbsp;
shoot Hyeon, Park comes with the test result.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:53.840
Turns out, the DNA test comes out negative and&nbsp;
Hyeon’s DNA doesn’t match with the culprit’s.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:57.920
Hyeon is once again dismissed and&nbsp;
the case is closed as unsolved.&nbsp;

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:03.200
17 years later, Park who has quitted his job&nbsp;
as detective, revisits the first crime scene.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:08.880
There, a girl told him that a man also visited the&nbsp;
same place some time ago to reminisce about his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:14.240
past actions. Realizing that the man could be the&nbsp;
perpetrator, Park asks the girl about his face.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:20.080
She says that the man’s face is plain, without&nbsp;
any suspicion. In the end, Park looks into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:24.240
the camera as if he starts to look for the&nbsp;
culprit once more, with a new broader lead.&nbsp;
