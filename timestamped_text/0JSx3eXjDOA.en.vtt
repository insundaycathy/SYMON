00:00:00.451 --> 00:00:03.810
(movie reel clicking)

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:04.720
- [Jacob] We've already tackled

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:06.250
the first six seasons of Supernatural,

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:08.980
but this time we're taking
it all the way to season 14,

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:10.700
and I'm going to go out
on a limb and say that

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.650
this timeline might be even
more insane than the first half.

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.200
So, it's time to save
people and hunt things.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.400
Season six, 2010 to 2011.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.170
It's good we're starting
back up at season six

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.130
because this is where the
timeline starts to get

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:24.963
a little weird.

00:00:24.963 --> 00:00:26.510
Well, weirder than it already was.

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:28.850
The showrunners decided
to use soap opera time

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:30.660
so that Sam and Dean
could spend a year apart

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.340
without them actually having
to spend a year apart.

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.390
So while season six should have started

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.730
in spring or summer of 2011,
instead it's dated to 2010.

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.200
So what happens in that missing year?

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.640
Well, Dean starts his new
life with Lisa and Ben.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.580
Castiel pulls Sam out of hell
but his soul is left behind.

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.450
Soulless Sam wanders around topside,

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:48.440
but he doesn't tell Dean

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.160
because he wants him
to live a normal life.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.830
Castiel starts the angel
civil war against Raphael,

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:54.800
who wants things to go
back to how they were.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.970
Cas needs allies and
makes a deal with Crowley,

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:58.220
who's the new ruler of hell,

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.480
to find a way to use
the souls in purgatory.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.400
In the Supernatural-verse,
souls are like atomic bombs

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.820
and everyone spends the
season stockpiling them.

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.490
Crowley resurrects Samuel Campbell,

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.140
Sam and Dean's maternal grandfather,

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.030
and other Campbell Hunters
to help him find purgatory.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.160
Soulless Sam joins the Campbells.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.640
Around summer of 2010, Sam
shows up and saves Dean

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.240
from a djinn trying to take revenge.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.510
Sam doesn't tell Dean about
his missing soul though.

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:22.480
But, good news!

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:23.970
Dean gets another baby!

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.600
This time it's a shapeshifter baby,

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.560
and the Winchesters leave
it in the capable hands

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.230
of Christian and Arlene Campbell,
who raise it as their own.

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:32.260
Samuel tells them about Alphas,

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.860
the patient zero of
monsters created by Eve

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.080
that in turn created all other monsters.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.730
Dean's glad that Sam is back and all,

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.780
but he's suspicious of Sam and Samuel.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.210
Later, they call down Castiel
while trying to solve a case.

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.530
He tells them about the
missing weapons of heaven,

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.670
supernatural weapons created
by God and the angels.

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.067
After Castiel fights another
angel, he also tells the boys

00:01:52.067 --> 00:01:54.360
about the civil war going on in heaven.

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.817
You know, it seems like a thing

00:01:55.817 --> 00:01:57.840
that maybe he shoulda mentioned.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.980
In the fall, Bobby gets
his soul back from Crowley

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:01.320
after the boys fly to Scotland

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.090
and threaten to burn the demon's bones.

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.500
In October, Dean briefly
becomes a vampire.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.333
And this is a pretty big deal,

00:02:06.333 --> 00:02:09.500
because Sam could have prevented
Dean from getting turned,

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.390
but instead appears kinda aroused by it.

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.690
On the bright side, the boys
uncover a cure for vampirism.

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.600
And they meet the vampire Alpha.

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.160
Lisa, though, breaks it off with Dean,

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.165
which seems fair when your
partner is always dying

00:02:22.165 --> 00:02:24.430
and/or turning into a vampire.

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.118
I don't know, I don't know if a vampire

00:02:26.118 --> 00:02:28.430
would be a deal breaker for me.

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.890
Dean has plenty to distract
him from the break up though.

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.347
He finally discovers what's
going on with Sam's soul

00:02:33.347 --> 00:02:35.300
in that it's missing.

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.070
Samuel is capturing the Alphas
and bringing them to Crowley

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:39.750
so that he can find the entrance to hell.

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.140
Crowley says that he
can get Sam's soul back

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.360
if they help him catch Alphas.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.016
Later in the fall, it's
revealed that while fairies

00:02:46.016 --> 00:02:48.440
and Robert Picardo do exist

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.170
in the Supernatural
universe, aliens don't.

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:52.390
Really Supernatural?

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.990
You're gonna give me Osiris
and Dragons but not aliens?

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:58.750
Next you're gonna tell me
that there's no Bigfoot.

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.160
What, he doesn't?

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.150
Well, okay, whatever.

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.730
At least that means the
Winchesters don't have to kill him.

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.850
The brothers team up with
Meg to capture Crowley,

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.450
and Castiel succeeds in killing
him by burning his bones.

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:09.610
Dean makes a deal with Death,

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.920
trading his ring to get
Sam's soul out of the Cage.

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.010
He's also nice enough to
put a wall in Sam's mind

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.220
to keep his memories of the
Cage from driving him insane.

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.610
At the end of 2010, Sam
wakes up without any memories

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.010
of the year that wasn't,
or the past few months.

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.640
But he does have a soul now, yay!

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.460
Just in time for a group of dragons

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:27.930
to perform a ritual and
open the door to purgatory,

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.760
releasing the mother of all monsters, Eve.

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.070
Okay, sure.

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:33.950
In early 2011, the gang discovers

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:35.850
that they need phoenix ashes to kill Eve.

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.400
Problem is, phoenixes are extinct.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.290
No sweat, they can just time travel.

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.240
We talked about this in the last video.

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.840
So Cas zaps them back to March 4th, 1861,

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.354
when Samuel Colt killed a
phoenix with his magic gun.

00:03:47.354 --> 00:03:48.460
RIP, Fawkes.

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:51.260
Sam, Dean, and Bobby encounter
one of Eve's new monsters,

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.420
which Dean dubs Jefferson Starship.

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.170
Dean kills Eve with the phoenix ash.

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.260
But before she dies she reveals
that Crowley is still alive.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.370
Sam and Bobby are suspicious
of Cas, but Dean defends him.

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.600
In the summer, after
tricking still-alive Crowley,

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:04.950
Castiel completes the ritual

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.940
to absorb all of the souls from purgatory.

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.220
And they don't exactly go down easy.

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.700
Cas is driven wild by the
power of all of the souls.

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.120
Crowley escapes, but not before

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.810
Cas kills his rival, Raphael.

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:17.300
Dean tries to convince
Cas to give up the souls,

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:18.760
but instead of doing that,

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.220
Cas declares himself their new God.

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.540
Season seven, 2011 to 2012.

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.470
Season seven opens in June 2011.

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.690
Sam begins to have
hallucinations of Lucifer.

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.060
Death tells Team Free
Will about the leviathans,

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.110
those super-powerful monsters

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:33.950
that God made all those millennia ago.

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:38.000
And good news, they're
now inside of Castiel.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.960
The leviathans escape Cas's
body and one possesses him.

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.250
Leviathan Cas releases all of the monsters

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:44.470
into the local water supply,

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:46.870
because apparently we need
to be even more concerned

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:47.830
about clean water.

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.680
The only thing left of
Cas is his trench coat.

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:51.890
It's a good trench coat.

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:52.900
Unfortunately for the boys,

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.690
the leviathans turn out
to be impossible to kill.

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:57.830
Also they burn Bobby's house down.

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.320
Also, things get worse for Bobby.

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.200
This is a bad season for him.

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.350
Sam marries Supernatural superfan Becky

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:05.960
after a whirlwind courtship.

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.830
Maybe too much of a whirlwind.

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:09.550
Dean teams up with a hunter named Garth

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:10.560
to get to the bottom of it.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:11.520
The marriage is annulled,

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.800
and Garth's just happy to
have made a new friend.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.040
In the fall, two leviathans
posing as Sam and Dean

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.920
go on a crime spree

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.680
at the orders of their boss, Dick Roman.

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.147
Crowley tries to make a deal with Dick,

00:05:20.147 --> 00:05:23.380
but the leviathans hate
demons just as much as humans.

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:24.650
In January of 2012,

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:27.810
Bobby discovers leviathans
are allergic to borax.

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:29.730
The gang also uncovers
the leviathans' plot

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:31.010
to make humans more docile

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:33.350
by poisoning the food at
Biggerson's, a fast food chain.

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:36.199
They get away, but not before
Dick Roman shoots Bobby

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:37.410
in the head.

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:39.300
He later dies from his injury.

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:40.410
Goodnight, sweet idjit.

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:43.860
I wasn't lying when I said
things got worse for Bobby.

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:44.786
In the Spring, the boys find out

00:05:44.786 --> 00:05:48.230
that a miracle worker called
Emmanuel is actually Castiel.

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:49.830
Meg, who's also on the outs with Crowley,

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:51.820
agrees to keep an eye on
him in a mental hospital.

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:54.190
In April, Dick has one of his
employees, Charlie Bradbury,

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:55.790
try to hack Frank's hard drive.

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:57.170
Charlie learns about the leviathans

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:00.040
and uses her powers for
good, she helps Sam and Dean.

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:02.500
She discovers that Dick has
found the leviathan tablet,

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:05.080
part of the Word of God, and
it's flying back to the U.S.

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:08.370
on a plane borrowed from Donald Trump.

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:10.080
Make of that what you will.

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.460
Team Free Will though,
intercepts the tablet.

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:15.350
In May, Kevin Tran, honor
student and prophet of the Lord,

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:16.560
begins to hear angels.

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.830
He steals the leviathan
tablet at their bidding.

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:21.430
He's then kidnapped by Edgar
and forced to read the tablet

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:22.460
for the Leviathans.

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:23.968
Later in May, the gang attacks Dick

00:06:23.968 --> 00:06:26.120
at his evil corporation, Sucrocorp.

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.740
Sam manages to free Kevin.

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:30.040
And in return, Kevin tells
them that they have to destroy

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.310
all of the tainted food.

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:33.350
Dean and Cas stab Dick
with a special weapon.

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:34.500
In the resulting explosion,

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:36.690
Dean and Cas are pulled into purgatory.

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:38.480
Also, Crowley manages to pop in

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:41.010
in time to kidnap Kevin
before Sam can stop him.

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:44.430
Because Kevin is the Princess
Peach of this series.

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:46.730
Season eight, 2012 to 2013.

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:48.690
Season eight brings us
another missing year.

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:50.167
It passes while Dean is in Purgatory

00:06:50.167 --> 00:06:52.440
and Sam is living a Nicholas Sparks novel.

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:54.540
So if you wanted to have
this timeline make sense,

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:56.800
you'd add two years onto the dates now.

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:58.140
But this is Supernatural.

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:00.420
Logic is for squares.

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:03.680
In fall of 2012, Dean returns
from purgatory without Castiel

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.180
but with his new boyfriend,

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:09.110
I mean, totally platonic best
buddy, a vampire named Benny.

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:11.090
Dean finds Sam and learns
he's given up hunting

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:11.923
to have a dog.

00:07:11.923 --> 00:07:14.180
Dean then finds a year-old
message from Kevin Tran

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:15.140
on an old cell phone.

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:17.250
It leads them to Kevin's
hiding place in a church.

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:19.480
And hey, he's managed to
steal the demon tablet

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:20.950
from Crowley while he was escaping.

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:22.260
The tablet tells them how to close

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:23.400
the gates of hell forever.

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:25.630
And Kevin is kind enough
to translate it for them.

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:27.970
In December, Kevin is
kidnapped by Crowley again,

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:29.940
along with all the
other existing prophets,

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:31.970
because this kid just can't catch a break.

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:34.210
In better news, Castiel is back.

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:36.385
But he doesn't remember how
he got out of purgatory.

00:07:36.385 --> 00:07:39.350
The demon tablet breaks in half
when the gang rescues Kevin.

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:41.700
Kevin gets one half and
Garth hides the other.

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:44.750
An angel named Naomi, which
is a very angel-y name

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:46.560
if you ask me, visits Castiel.

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:48.760
She tells him that the angels
rescued him from purgatory

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:50.680
so that he could spy on Sam and Dean.

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:53.930
In January of 2013, Henry
Winchester, the boys' grandfather,

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:56.570
pays them a visit all the way from 1958.

00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:57.630
You'll remember that

00:07:57.630 --> 00:08:00.280
from the last Supernatural video we did.

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:01.760
He tells them about the Men of Letters,

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:03.850
a secret society that
protects supernatural

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:04.870
and occult knowledge.

00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:06.670
They help him defend the
Men of Letters secrets

00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:08.427
from Abaddon, who followed
Henry through time.

00:08:08.427 --> 00:08:10.520
And they also adopt the
Men of Letters bunker

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:11.660
as their new headquarters.

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:13.830
In February, Kevin discovers
that the gates of hell

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:16.660
can be closed for good by
completing three trials.

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:19.050
Meanwhile, Naomi tries to
get Castiel to kill Dean,

00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:20.830
but he finally breaks her control

00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:23.180
and steals the angel
tablet, an ancient scripture

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:25.190
that tells humanity about the angels.

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:26.570
Castiel disappears with it.

00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:28.620
To complete the second trial
to close the gates of hell,

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:31.230
Sam goes to purgatory to
take Bobby's soul to heaven.

00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:32.130
He completes the trial

00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:34.120
with the help of Dean's vampire pal Benny.

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:35.920
Meanwhile, never a dull moment for Kevin,

00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:38.090
he starts seeing
hallucinations of Crowley.

00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:39.930
And they cause him to
freak out and run off

00:08:39.930 --> 00:08:40.940
with the demon tablet.

00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:42.912
Later, Crowley tricks
Kevin into translating

00:08:42.912 --> 00:08:45.690
both halves of the demon tablet.

00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:47.100
At this point Kevin should really

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:48.560
just stop translating (beep).

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:50.420
In May, Crowley captures Castiel.

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:52.480
Crowley reveals that he
has been working with Naomi

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:53.850
to get the angel tablet back.

00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:56.010
Sam and Dean find Metatron,
the scribe of God,

00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:58.170
who agrees to help them
get both tablets back.

00:08:58.170 --> 00:08:59.860
He tracks down Kevin and saves him

00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:01.750
just as he's being strangled by Crowley.

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:03.680
Sam then tries to
complete the final trial,

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:04.790
but he's too weak.

00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:07.480
Metatron tricks Castiel into
completing the angel trials

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:08.313
under the assumption

00:09:08.313 --> 00:09:09.970
that they'll lock all
of the angels in Heaven,

00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:13.150
but instead ends up banishing
all of them to earth.

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:16.520
All of the angels fall, Cas's
grace is stolen by Metatron,

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:19.210
and Sam is hospitalized
as a result of the trials.

00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:21.900
Season nine, 2013 to 2014.

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:23.860
Season nine opens with Sam in the ER.

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:26.230
Dean allows an angel, who
says his name is Ezekiel,

00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:28.450
to possess Sam in order to
heal him from the trials.

00:09:28.450 --> 00:09:30.160
But since this is Supernatural,

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:32.690
it has to be a secret and
no one but Dean can know.

00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:35.670
Also there's yet another
civil war going on

00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:37.340
between the now-fallen angels.

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:39.870
They spend a lot of this
season killing each other off.

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:41.380
By late May, Abaddon is trying

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:42.910
to take over hell from Crowley.

00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:45.020
Fully-human Castiel is having a hard time.

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:46.710
The brothers offer to
put him up at the bunker,

00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:49.090
but Ezekiel is afraid of being found out

00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:50.820
and makes Dean kick Cas to the curb.

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:53.290
In June we learn that
the wicked witch is real,

00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:56.910
and so is Oz, which is a fictional world

00:09:56.910 --> 00:10:01.910
created by L. Frank Baum,
but aliens still don't exist.

00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:03.810
Yeah, I'm still not over that.

00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:06.130
Anyway, Charlie lives in Oz now

00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:09.060
because Felicia Day has
better things to do, I hope.

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:11.290
Sometime in the summer the
brothers discover Castiel

00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:12.690
working at a gas station.

00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:14.670
Then in the fall the
brothers finally learn

00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:17.240
that their buddy Ezekiel
is actually Gadreel,

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:19.880
the angel who let Lucifer
into the Garden of Eden.

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:22.010
Gadreel teams up with
Metatron, kills Kevin,

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:23.400
and takes off in the Impala.

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:24.810
By now I'm shocked that the brothers

00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:26.410
haven't developed worse trust issues

00:10:26.410 --> 00:10:28.700
considering everyone is
either a secret angel,

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:30.940
secretly God, or possessed by a demon.

00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:32.700
But I guess that's just
par for the course for them

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:33.533
at this point.

00:10:33.533 --> 00:10:34.730
Castiel gets his grace back

00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:36.930
after killing some fanatic fallen angels

00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:39.303
because I guess that's how grace works?

00:10:39.303 --> 00:10:41.750
But that leaves Dean and
Cas to team up with Crowley

00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:44.180
to track down Gadreel,
who's still possessing Sam.

00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:46.720
Sam, possessed by Crowley,
is able to force Gadreel

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:48.150
to return to his original vessel,

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:50.300
but in return he wants
them to kill Abaddon.

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:53.250
In December, Crowley sends
the boys after the First Blade

00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:55.470
since that's the only thing
that can kill Abaddon,

00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:56.303
a knight of hell.

00:10:56.303 --> 00:10:57.850
They find Cain on the way.

00:10:57.850 --> 00:10:59.710
Cain agrees to give them the First Blade,

00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:01.130
but it can only be wielded by the one

00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:02.620
who bears the Mark of Cain.

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:04.680
Dean is worthy of the
mark, but Cain warns him

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:06.620
about the great toll
it takes on its bearer.

00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:07.800
Dean's seen a lot at this point,

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:09.370
so he still agrees to bear the mark

00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:10.930
so he can wield the First Blade.

00:11:10.930 --> 00:11:13.220
By spring 2014, Abaddon
is collecting souls

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:14.053
to build an army.

00:11:14.053 --> 00:11:16.490
So now they need to kill her even more.

00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:17.707
Sam and Dean capture Gadreel,

00:11:17.707 --> 00:11:20.760
but Metatron turns the tables
on them and captures Castiel.

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:23.150
You get captured, and you get captured,

00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:25.110
and everybody gets captured!

00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:27.960
By June, Castiel is still
Metatron's prisoner.

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:29.520
But he's making good use of his time

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:32.450
by trying to convince Gadreel
that Metatron is bad news,

00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:34.850
and there's room on Team
Free Will for another member.

00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:36.480
Metatron tries to end the civil war

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:38.420
by uniting all of the angels under him,

00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:41.060
but Castiel's there to
lead the dissenting angels.

00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:42.720
Angels start attacking humanity,

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:44.720
and it looks like they're
following Cas's orders,

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:46.167
but it turns out that Metatron is the one

00:11:46.167 --> 00:11:47.530
who is pulling the strings.

00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:50.333
Finally, Gadreel joins Team
Free Will to defeat Metatron.

00:11:50.333 --> 00:11:53.450
Dean kills Abaddon,
Castiel captures Metatron,

00:11:53.450 --> 00:11:54.996
but they're not getting off that easy.

00:11:54.996 --> 00:11:56.730
Metatron kills Dean,

00:11:56.730 --> 00:11:58.700
who must be pretty used to dying by now.

00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:01.970
But because of the Mark of
Cain, he becomes a demon.

00:12:01.970 --> 00:12:04.320
Season ten, 2014 to 2015.

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:06.400
Season ten kicks off with
Dean being resurrected

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:08.768
by the Mark of Cain, which at this point,

00:12:08.768 --> 00:12:11.689
look, if you're still here,
you get it, it's Supernatural,

00:12:11.689 --> 00:12:13.720
death just does not stick.

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:16.100
Anyway, because he's a demon,
he's working with Crowley.

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:18.450
And Sam is searching for
him, because the rule is

00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:20.180
you can't go more than two seasons

00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:22.010
without separating the
Winchester brothers.

00:12:22.010 --> 00:12:23.957
Meanwhile, Cas is looking
for missing angels,

00:12:23.957 --> 00:12:25.960
and Metatron is in heaven in prison.

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:28.830
But how can heaven even have a prison?

00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:30.590
Actually, nevermind, I shouldn't even be

00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:31.790
asking these questions.

00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:33.980
In August, Dean humiliates Crowley

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:36.800
so the demon gives Sam
Dean's location as payback.

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:39.530
In return, Sam gives
Crowley the First Blade.

00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:41.980
Soon after, Sam and Cas
cure Dean of demonitis

00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:43.090
with purified blood.

00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:44.798
Then one of the most important events

00:12:44.798 --> 00:12:48.230
in the Supernatural timeline occurs,

00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:51.270
Supernatural the Musical premieres.

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:53.840
Rowena, the powerful natural
witch and Crowley's mom

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:56.210
resurfaces in season ten,
ready to (beep beep) up.

00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:58.560
Crowley's not too happy to
see his absentee mom again,

00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:00.250
and throws her in a dungeon in hell.

00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:02.100
There, she begins
plotting against her son.

00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:04.250
She spends the rest of the
season manipulating him

00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:06.370
and proving that Crowley
wasn't missing much

00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:08.600
when she disappeared from
his life for 300 years.

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:11.390
Sometime later, Cas feels bad
about Jimmy Novak's daughter,

00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:13.440
Claire, for the first time in five years,

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:14.630
so they go find her.

00:13:14.630 --> 00:13:16.660
Meanwhile, Dean's mark is still acting up.

00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:18.630
Like, really acting up.

00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:21.130
And Dean goes on a murderous
rampage as a result.

00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:22.690
Cas tries to make things right with Claire

00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:24.410
while the boys try to
get Metatron to tell them

00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:25.840
how to get rid of the damned mark.

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:29.180
Oh, and Charlie comes back from Oz world.

00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:30.930
Sam and Cas contact ghost Bobby

00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:33.880
because we just haven't had
enough Bobby in our lives.

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:35.930
They ask for help to spring
Metatron out of prison,

00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:38.290
in hopes that he'll give them
more info about the mark.

00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:40.590
Charlie finds the Book of
the Damned in a monastery.

00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:43.300
It contains dark magic that
she believes can help Dean

00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:44.240
get rid of the mark.

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:46.820
The book originally belonged
to the Styne family,

00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:49.065
a bunch of evil magic Frankensteins.

00:13:49.065 --> 00:13:51.630
And they're none too pleased
that Charlie has it now.

00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:53.500
Around May 2015, the Stynes are mad

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:54.680
about the book being stolen,

00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:56.237
so they kill Charlie in retribution.

00:13:56.237 --> 00:13:59.040
Dean goes on a good ol'
fashion killing spree

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:01.630
like the mascot of
toxic masculinity he is.

00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:04.310
He wipes out the Stynes,
and, look, listen guys,

00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:06.370
I know we love Dean, but can we all agree

00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:08.240
that he just needs, he needs some help?

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:10.570
I mean, he decides that the
only way to get rid of his mark

00:14:10.570 --> 00:14:12.530
is to kill Death, which seems rude

00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:14.650
considering how many
solids Death has done them

00:14:14.650 --> 00:14:15.520
over the years.

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:17.970
Dean then stabs Death with his own scythe

00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:20.170
and opens a portal to the Darkness.

00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:21.920
No, sadly, not the band.

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:23.167
They have songs other than

00:14:23.167 --> 00:14:24.570
"I Believe in a Thing Called Love,"

00:14:24.570 --> 00:14:26.170
and they're all excellent.

00:14:26.170 --> 00:14:27.510
Listen to all of them.

00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:29.930
Season eleven, 2015 to 2016.

00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:31.830
The Darkness, who is named Amara,

00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:34.050
which you'll remember
from our first video,

00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:36.710
is on the loose and Dean
has the hots for her.

00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:39.070
The feeling is mutual, and
she spends the whole season

00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:40.520
talking about their connection.

00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:43.200
Except now she's a baby,
and that is awkward.

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:45.587
Crowley takes the baby
Amara and feeds her souls

00:14:45.587 --> 00:14:47.360
and the brothers do not like this.

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:49.700
Elsewhere, Crowley's mom
and powerful witch Rowena

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:51.740
is trying to start a mega coven,

00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:53.690
which is a great name for a metal band.

00:14:53.690 --> 00:14:56.110
So anyway, Sam and Dean
go on a hunt with Baby

00:14:56.110 --> 00:14:58.610
in an episode that has no
right being as good as it is.

00:14:58.610 --> 00:15:00.150
Cas starts tracking down Metatron

00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:01.500
to ask for help with Amara.

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:03.482
Meanwhile, Sam, Crowley
and Rowena travel to hell

00:15:03.482 --> 00:15:05.460
to ask Lucifer for help.

00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:07.080
I mean, any port in a storm, right?

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:08.610
This obviously doesn't go well

00:15:08.610 --> 00:15:11.460
and Dean has to save his
brother from hell, again.

00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:14.629
Lucifer possesses
Castiel, creating Luciel?

00:15:14.629 --> 00:15:15.940
Castifer?

00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:18.180
I don't know, I'm gonna go with Castifer.

00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:21.540
Castifer sends Dean back in
time to a World War I submarine

00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:22.580
to get the Hand of God,

00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:25.370
a weapon that may be powerful
enough to kill Amara.

00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:27.310
In March 2017, the brothers team up

00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:28.880
with two married hunters,

00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:31.670
and this episode is important
because the hunters are gay,

00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:34.260
one is latino, and neither of them die.

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:36.330
And that's just revolutionary.

00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:39.460
Shortly later, Chuck tells
Metatron that he's God

00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:41.380
in a twist that I swear they just borrowed

00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:43.800
from every fan theory website since 2008.

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:45.010
I'm still reeling from the fact

00:15:45.010 --> 00:15:48.270
that they got B-list country
singer Branford Emberton

00:15:48.270 --> 00:15:49.150
to play God.

00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:51.240
Just kidding, I just made that person up.

00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:53.860
But if you look at God, you
might think for a second

00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:55.550
that I was actually telling the truth.

00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:56.750
And that's kind of the point.

00:15:56.750 --> 00:15:58.390
Anyway, the gang all gets together

00:15:58.390 --> 00:15:59.780
to try to get Castifer back.

00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:02.120
Amara burns Lucifer out of Castiel's body

00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:03.660
and everyone thinks he's dead.

00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:06.320
Spoilers, he's not, this is Supernatural.

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:08.680
She injures Chuck and the world is ending.

00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:11.530
And somewhere in the UK a
British lady is mad about this.

00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:14.060
Team Free Will have a new
plan to take out Amara,

00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:16.494
they're gonna build a bomb out of souls.

00:16:16.494 --> 00:16:17.570
Aw yeah.

00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:18.960
Dean and Amara have a heart to heart

00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:20.960
and it turns out that Amara
just wants to be close

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:23.620
to her brother Chuck, and that's
why she tried to kill him.

00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:25.420
You know, classic family drama.

00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:26.740
Chuck and Amara decide to have

00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:28.210
some sibling bonding time.

00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:30.500
They fix the world and
then just disappear,

00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:32.610
but not before granting
Dean his greatest wish,

00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:34.970
which is that his mother
wasn't dead, apparently.

00:16:34.970 --> 00:16:37.340
Back at the bunker the
British lady, Toni, shows up

00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:41.330
and kidnaps Sam just before
undead Mary Winchester shows up.

00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:44.000
Season twelve, 2016 to 2017.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.570
Around summer 2016, Dean, his mom, and Cas

00:16:46.570 --> 00:16:49.320
try to rescue Sam, who is being
tortured for his past sins

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:52.160
by the series' silliest
villains, mean British people

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:53.900
who are annoyed that the Winchesters keep

00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:55.300
almost ending the world.

00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:56.890
Not that I don't understand.

00:16:56.890 --> 00:16:58.518
Lucifer is also not actually dead,

00:16:58.518 --> 00:17:01.970
he's been inside a rockstar
who is surprisingly tragic.

00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:06.690
It's the one and only Rick
Springfield, aka Vince Vincente.

00:17:06.690 --> 00:17:07.523
What am I reading?

00:17:07.523 --> 00:17:10.682
Somebody please save me from
this descent into madness.

00:17:10.682 --> 00:17:13.420
Cas and Crowley team up to find him.

00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:16.180
In December, after his rockstar
vessel doesn't pan out,

00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:18.370
Lucifer possesses the President

00:17:18.370 --> 00:17:19.950
which feels very close to home.

00:17:19.950 --> 00:17:21.530
Is this political commentary?

00:17:21.530 --> 00:17:23.434
And there are still no aliens?

00:17:23.434 --> 00:17:26.070
President Lucifer wastes no time

00:17:26.070 --> 00:17:27.709
in abusing the powers of his office,

00:17:27.709 --> 00:17:30.170
and tries to pressure Ukraine
into investigating Joe Biden,

00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:32.230
I mean he gets his secretary pregnant.

00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:34.090
Aw, geez, what a slip of the tongue.

00:17:34.090 --> 00:17:36.570
Sam and Dean break into the White House,

00:17:36.570 --> 00:17:39.290
are detained in solitary
confinement for about two months,

00:17:39.290 --> 00:17:41.750
and escape with the help of
the British Men of Letters.

00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:43.860
They really should have
given them a better name.

00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:46.710
In March of 2017, Mary
teams up with Mister Ketch,

00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:48.380
who is a character genetically engineered

00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:50.020
to be impossible to care about.

00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:52.100
He convinces Mary to
start killing hunters.

00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:53.300
They do it.

00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:55.840
Team Free Will tries to warn
the secretary, Kelly Kline,

00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:57.310
about her baby being evil.

00:17:57.310 --> 00:17:58.670
I mean, is this really a surprise?

00:17:58.670 --> 00:18:01.450
It is the President's,
I mean, Lucifer's baby.

00:18:01.450 --> 00:18:02.420
Kelly goes on the run,

00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:04.740
but Cas decides to help
her hide from Lucifer.

00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:06.590
A group of hunters storm
the British home base

00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:08.020
and kick ass American style.

00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:11.190
Mary feels bad about
doing all of the murders,

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:13.250
but her son forgives her and they hug.

00:18:13.250 --> 00:18:16.266
So I guess it's all okay
with all of the murders.

00:18:16.266 --> 00:18:19.070
On May 18th, 2017, Kelly gives birth,

00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:20.780
which creates a tear in space time

00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:22.310
that leads to an alternate dimension

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:24.530
with an Apocalypse World version of Bobby.

00:18:24.530 --> 00:18:25.850
Oh, and it also kills her.

00:18:25.850 --> 00:18:28.290
Crowley and Cas die after
trying to kill Lucifer.

00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:30.790
But what's another measly
death at this point?

00:18:30.790 --> 00:18:33.128
Mary and Lucifer are pulled
into the alternate universe.

00:18:33.128 --> 00:18:36.250
After the fight, Sam finds
the Satan baby, Jack,

00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:38.030
is now a teenager.

00:18:38.030 --> 00:18:40.860
Yep, definitely tracks for a Satan baby.

00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:43.700
Season thirteen, 2017 to 2018.

00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:45.700
Y'all, we're almost caught up!

00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:48.090
They're gonna let me out of my cage soon.

00:18:48.090 --> 00:18:50.470
One day after his birth,
Jack says father a lot

00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:52.010
and has black canary powers.

00:18:52.010 --> 00:18:53.630
The boys decide to take Jack in.

00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:55.490
Sam is ready to accept the spawn of Satan,

00:18:55.490 --> 00:18:57.016
but Dean's suspicious.

00:18:57.016 --> 00:18:59.790
In the alternate universe,
Lucifer keeps Mary alive

00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:01.340
as a hostage, to trade for Jack.

00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:04.920
But then they run into Apocalypse
Michael, who is bad news.

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:07.300
In May of 2017, Castiel
is in the big Empty,

00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:08.830
where angels go when they die.

00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:10.520
He's supposed to be in an eternal sleep,

00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:11.690
but he somehow wakes up,

00:19:11.690 --> 00:19:13.710
possibly because Jack
just misses him too much.

00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:16.030
He learns about the Empty
from the cosmic black goo

00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:16.920
that reigns there.

00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:19.550
The goo gets sick of all of
the chaos Castiel is creating,

00:19:19.550 --> 00:19:22.180
so it boots Cas out of the
Empty and back into realty.

00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:25.400
Billie the Reaper is the new
Death, and Castiel is back.

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:26.233
Huzzah!.

00:19:26.233 --> 00:19:28.570
In June, Jack runs away,
believing he's a monster.

00:19:28.570 --> 00:19:31.330
The boys hunt him down with
Asmodeus hot on their trail.

00:19:31.330 --> 00:19:32.680
Asmodeus is the new king of hell

00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:35.460
and definitely not
cosplaying Colonel Sanders.

00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:38.210
Lucifer escapes Apocalypse
World and returns back

00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:40.890
to our world, with the
help of that rascal Kevin,

00:19:40.890 --> 00:19:43.610
the Apocalypse World version of Kevin.

00:19:43.610 --> 00:19:45.060
Still weak from all they've been through,

00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:47.340
Lucifer and Castiel are
captured by Asmodeus

00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:50.020
and his henchman, Mister
Ketch, who is still alive

00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:53.240
because Chuck, aka God, has abandoned us.

00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:55.230
Later that summer, the
crew catches up with Jack.

00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:57.720
With the help of a dreamwalker,
Jack is able to find Mary,

00:19:57.720 --> 00:19:59.410
but learns that Sam and Dean are trapped

00:19:59.410 --> 00:20:00.750
in a very bad place.

00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:02.740
The Wayward sisters, Claire, Alex, Jody,

00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:03.890
and Donna rescue them.

00:20:03.890 --> 00:20:06.220
Rowena is still alive after
dying at Lucifer's hands

00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:07.053
a couple of times.

00:20:07.053 --> 00:20:09.228
Turns out her resurrection
charm sure came in handy.

00:20:09.228 --> 00:20:11.620
Speaking of the devil,
Cas and Lucifer team up

00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:14.410
to escape Asmodeus, and then
immediately turn on each other.

00:20:14.410 --> 00:20:16.361
In the fall, the boys
look for the demon tablet.

00:20:16.361 --> 00:20:18.130
Hey, remember that?

00:20:18.130 --> 00:20:19.790
They hope the tablet can open the portal

00:20:19.790 --> 00:20:20.920
to the Apocalypse World.

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:22.300
The brothers strike a deal with Ketch

00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:24.550
to fight off Lucifer
and Apocalypse Michael.

00:20:24.550 --> 00:20:26.440
Ketch is now acting as
a sort of double agent

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:27.410
for the Winchesters.

00:20:27.410 --> 00:20:29.710
Asmodeus reveals that he's
drawing power from Gabriel,

00:20:29.710 --> 00:20:32.730
who is also not dead, but
we like him so it's cool.

00:20:32.730 --> 00:20:35.240
Over in the Apocalypse
World, that world's Zachariah

00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:36.580
is going after Jack and Mary,

00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:39.000
believing that Jack can open
a rift between the worlds.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.700
But Apocalypse Bobby
arrives in a blaze of glory

00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:43.290
and helps Jack and Mary escape.

00:20:43.290 --> 00:20:44.123
In the winter,

00:20:44.123 --> 00:20:46.295
another iconic Supernatural
episode takes place,

00:20:46.295 --> 00:20:50.680
or should I say Scooby-natural
episode takes place.

00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:53.270
Cut to Dean's Scooby-Doo impression.

00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:55.760
Finally in the spring of
2018, Dean and Ketch make it

00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:56.800
to Apocalypse World.

00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:58.620
They try to rescue
Apocalypse World Charlie,

00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:00.690
who tells them about what
Jack and Mary have been up to

00:21:00.690 --> 00:21:02.120
since getting sucked into the world.

00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:04.010
Meanwhile, Cas and Sam find Gabriel.

00:21:04.010 --> 00:21:06.330
They free him, but as soon as
he's free, he takes off again.

00:21:06.330 --> 00:21:07.163
But it's not too long

00:21:07.163 --> 00:21:08.650
before he's knocking on their door again,

00:21:08.650 --> 00:21:10.420
seeking help after being
injured in a fight.

00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:12.390
In the summer, Rowena
and Gabriel work together

00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:13.370
to capture Lucifer.

00:21:13.370 --> 00:21:15.610
The Winchester brothers travel
through the Apocalypse World

00:21:15.610 --> 00:21:16.630
with Cas and Gabriel.

00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:18.100
The boys rush to find Mary and Jack,

00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:20.540
but Sam is killed by monsters
before they can find him.

00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:21.880
His death doesn't stick long, though,

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:23.450
because Lucifer brings him back,

00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:25.740
and then Sam takes Lucifer to meet Jack.

00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:28.180
I love how at this point we're
just like, and then Sam died,

00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:30.690
but whatever, he didn't
actually die, he's fine.

00:21:30.690 --> 00:21:32.170
In the fall, the gang makes an attempt

00:21:32.170 --> 00:21:34.030
to rescue the people of Apocalypse World.

00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:36.200
They open a rift that
allows the Apocalypse folks

00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:37.310
to enter our world,

00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:39.090
but Michael comes through
the rift with them.

00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:41.750
Apocalypse Michael kills
Gabriel and defeats Lucifer,

00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:44.910
but both Michael and Lucifer
are locked in Apocalypse World.

00:21:44.910 --> 00:21:47.122
Lucifer and Michael team up
and, with their powers combined,

00:21:47.122 --> 00:21:48.720
are able to escape.

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:49.710
They attack the bunker.

00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:52.220
Lucifer takes Jack's
grace, leaving him human.

00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:54.960
Dean says yes to Michael
in order to defeat Lucifer.

00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:57.400
Clearly Michael's pact with
Lucifer is short lived.

00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:59.580
Dean finally succeeds in killing Lucifer,

00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:02.190
but then Michael takes
off with Dean's body.

00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:06.360
Season fourteen, 2018 to 2019.

00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:08.970
In October of 2018, Dean,
still possessed by Michael,

00:22:08.970 --> 00:22:10.050
has been missing for weeks.

00:22:10.050 --> 00:22:12.630
Turns out he's busy flying
around the world being a dick.

00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:14.270
Apocalypse Bobby is back in our world,

00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:16.940
and uses his gruff charm
to try to train human Jack.

00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:18.730
Sam has taken charge of
the new Hunter network,

00:22:18.730 --> 00:22:20.360
and he and Cas are on the hunt for Dean.

00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:22.300
Now tired of flying
around and being a dick,

00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:24.840
Michael/Dean begins
experimenting on monsters

00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:26.430
by enhancing them with his grace.

00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:27.310
Through all of this though,

00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:29.580
Dean does manage to
escape Michael's grasp.

00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:31.970
Around November of 2018, Jack collapses.

00:22:31.970 --> 00:22:34.210
His human and angel
sides are out of balance.

00:22:34.210 --> 00:22:35.430
They go to Rowena for help,

00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:37.510
but Jack dies before they
can treat his condition.

00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:40.210
It turns out that the Empty
is pursuing Jack's soul.

00:22:40.210 --> 00:22:42.320
Castiel makes a deal with
the Empty to save Jack,

00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:43.840
and successfully brings him back.

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:44.920
Well, for the most part.

00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:46.900
To get Jack back they
enlist the help of a woman

00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:47.970
who knows Angel magic

00:22:47.970 --> 00:22:50.410
that burns off some of her
human soul with each use.

00:22:50.410 --> 00:22:52.280
She teaches Jack to use the same magic,

00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:53.230
and tells him it's all good,

00:22:53.230 --> 00:22:56.540
don't worry about the
whole soul burning thing.

00:22:56.540 --> 00:22:58.140
By December, Michael has started making

00:22:58.140 --> 00:22:59.460
a roided-up demon army.

00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:01.810
Dean, Sam, Jack, and Cas
go to take down Michael,

00:23:01.810 --> 00:23:04.560
but in the ensuing fight
Michael repossesses Dean.

00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:06.310
The gang captures Michael/Dean

00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:08.330
and manages to trap
Michael in Dean's mind.

00:23:08.330 --> 00:23:10.550
Without Michael at the
helm, the army disperses.

00:23:10.550 --> 00:23:12.930
In early 2019, the boys
accidentally summon

00:23:12.930 --> 00:23:14.670
John Winchester from 2003.

00:23:14.670 --> 00:23:16.930
This creates another alternate timeline

00:23:16.930 --> 00:23:20.770
where Sam is internet famous
and Dean is a serial killer.

00:23:20.770 --> 00:23:21.670
Yeah, all right.

00:23:21.670 --> 00:23:23.890
Michael manages to break
out of Dean's mind prison

00:23:23.890 --> 00:23:25.330
and regain control of his body.

00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:27.790
Jack ends up burning up a lot of his soul

00:23:27.790 --> 00:23:28.857
in order to save Dean, Sam,

00:23:28.857 --> 00:23:30.550
and the rest of the crew from Michael.

00:23:30.550 --> 00:23:33.809
Jack kills Michael, but he's
used up almost all of his soul.

00:23:33.809 --> 00:23:35.340
Lucifer's former vessel, Nick,

00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:36.520
is running around killing people

00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:37.910
in order to resurrect Lucifer

00:23:37.910 --> 00:23:39.200
and bring him back from the Empty.

00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:41.810
Jack intervenes, and kills Nick real good.

00:23:41.810 --> 00:23:43.040
Maybe too good.

00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:45.100
Kinda seems like Jack's
completely soulless,

00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:46.690
that's how hard he killed that guy.

00:23:46.690 --> 00:23:48.600
Mary's horrified by what Jack has done,

00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:51.260
and he accidentally-on-purpose kills Mary,

00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:52.960
to prevent her from
telling the Winchesters

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:53.970
what he's done.

00:23:53.970 --> 00:23:56.190
Jack runs away and confuses himself

00:23:56.190 --> 00:23:58.860
with visions of a manipulative Lucifer.

00:23:58.860 --> 00:24:00.950
Sam, Cas, and Dean trap Jack in a prison,

00:24:00.950 --> 00:24:03.480
but he breaks out and he is pissed.

00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:06.170
Jack then unleashes mind
controls on the whole world,

00:24:06.170 --> 00:24:07.930
compelling everyone to the truth.

00:24:07.930 --> 00:24:10.950
God reverses Jack's mind control
and gives Sam and Cas a gun

00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:13.400
that can kill anything, including Jack,

00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:15.670
but it also kills the person who uses it.

00:24:15.670 --> 00:24:17.450
Dean can't bring himself to kill Jack,

00:24:17.450 --> 00:24:20.610
so God is the one who pulls
the trigger, figuratively.

00:24:20.610 --> 00:24:22.300
He actually just snaps his fingers,

00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:25.030
effectively killing Jack, 'cause he's God.

00:24:25.030 --> 00:24:27.800
At this point, it's clear that
God is a manipulative (beep)

00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:29.470
who has been watching all of this chaos

00:24:29.470 --> 00:24:30.520
for his own amusement.

00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:33.510
Enraged by this, Sam takes
the gun and shoots God.

00:24:33.510 --> 00:24:34.630
But surprise!

00:24:34.630 --> 00:24:37.910
Turns out the gun can't
exactly kill everything,

00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:39.650
'cause it doesn't kill God,

00:24:39.650 --> 00:24:42.000
I mean, also presumably because he's God.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.480
But Sam suffers a bullet
wound to the shoulder.

00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:46.040
God is angered by Sam's attack,

00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:47.500
so he decides to end the world

00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:50.390
by unleashing a plague of
zombies and hell beasts upon it,

00:24:50.390 --> 00:24:52.820
including some of the earliest
monsters of the series,

00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:55.110
even the ghost hitchhiker
lady from season one.

00:24:55.110 --> 00:24:59.500
So how do you go from locusts
to zombies to literally God?

00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:01.540
I guess that's what 14
seasons of Supernatural

00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:02.373
does to a guy.

00:25:02.373 --> 00:25:03.840
Jack wakes up in the Empty.

00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:06.990
Billie and the Shadow are
there, and they need to talk.

00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:09.377
So ends season 14.

00:25:09.377 --> 00:25:11.170
Wow, are you guys as tired as I am?

00:25:11.170 --> 00:25:13.700
'Cause I'm exhausted and
I haven't even died once.

00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:15.830
The Winchester boys must
be running on fumes.

00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:18.440
We've covered an amazing
number of monsters, angels,

00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:19.840
and extra-dimensional entities.

00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:21.950
But there's more to come
in the final season!

00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:23.280
I've been Jacob with Cinematica.

00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:24.320
And make sure to subscribe

00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:26.150
so you can catch our season 15 timeline

00:25:26.150 --> 00:25:27.110
when it does come out.

00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:30.888
Until then, I'm gonna,
I'm gonna go lie down.

00:25:30.888 --> 00:25:33.638
(dramatic music)
