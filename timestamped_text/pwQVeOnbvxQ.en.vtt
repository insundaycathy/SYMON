00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:01.740
Welcome to the Man of Recaps, this is

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.240
the ridiculously abridged, 
5 minute Game of Thrones recap!

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.280
The good guys are the Starks, they live in the North, 
and they're the ones who say "Winter is  coming."

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.860
Ned Stark is good friends with the
fat King Rob Baratheon,

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:14.700
but the Queen  Cersei Lannister - is the worst.

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.800
She's got a twin brother Jaime, 
and they are into twincest, oh!

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.140
So the Prince Joffrey is an incest baby,
 and maybe that's why he's such a twat.

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.580
Ned Stark figures it out, but too late the King already died so Joffrey takes the throne...

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.760
And you thought Ned Stark was the main character, but his head's cut off!

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.160
His son Robb Stark is named King in the North, and he goes to war to avenge his father,

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.060
but he marries for love, breaking a betrothal, so he's
betrayed and killed at the Red Wedding!

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.340
You thought he was the main character,
but he's dead too.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.980
The fat King's brothers both claim the throne, but Stannis is working with a Red Priestess,

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.200
who uses shadow magic to
assassinate his brother Renly!

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.980
With the united army he sails for King's Landing, but the Lannisters have a surprise for him...

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.940
Wildfire! BOOM! Blows up his whole fleet.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.960
So it looks like the Lannisters won, until Joffrey is poisoned at his own wedding!

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.460
And it looks like the killer is his uncle Tyrion!

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.780
Tyrion is the good Lannister, he's the dwarf who enjoys drinking and making funny quips.

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.200
His trial is a joke because his sister Cersei hates him, and his dad Tywin REALLY hates him,

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.380
so he demands trial by combat!

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.400
And it's the Viper versus the  Mountain, epic...
OH! Tyrion's guy won!

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.500
Until he starts showboating and OH!
 Gets his head crushed!

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.180
So Tyrion's sentenced to death,
but his brother Jaime breaks him out,

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.960
but Tyrion swings by his dad's room, finds him on the pooper, and BOOM! Crossbows him!

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.700
Now across the sea is Daenerys Targaryen, the last living member of the old Targaryen dynasty.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.080
She marries Horse-Barbarian Khal Drogo,
making her the Khaleesi.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.280
She gets some dragon eggs as a wedding
gift, but dragons are extinct - they definitely won't hatch.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.440
Long story short though Khal Drogo dies, and the dragons do hatch! Woah!

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.540
She trades a dragon for a slave army, but then
just kidding I'm keeping both!

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.580
BOOM! Conquers Slaver's Bay
and frees all the slaves.

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.380
She loiters for a few seasons, but then
Tyrion meets up with her,

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.620
and she's sailing for Westeros to claim her birthright - the Iron Throne!

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:02.460
Now Ned Stark had a bastard son named Jon Snow.
He joins the Night's Watch,

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.220
who guard The Wall from the terrors beyond - the White
Walkers! Don't worry they're just a myth...

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.400
But turns out they're not so mythical,
and they raise an army of Ice-Zombies!

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.300
But the Night's Watch doesn't like that
Jon made friends with the Wildlings,

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.580
so they mutiny and Julius Caesar him!

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.720
Oh! You thought he was the main character,
but now he's dead too.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.380
Except the Red Priestess was there,
and casts revive on him!

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.680
Oh! Jon Snow back to life!

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.260
He gets his friends together to reconquer Winterfell from Ramsay Bolton, who's a very bad guy.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.740
He's also a bastard, so they have an epic
Battle of the Bastards!

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.500
Jon wins and now they name him
the King in the North!

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.800
Now Ned Stark had a bunch of kids, we'll start with Sansa the pretty one,

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.280
who was engaged to Joffrey,
but he was awful to her,

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.360
then they married her to Tyrion,
who was nice to her,

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.120
but then they married her to Ramsay,
who was the worst.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.720
But now she's safe in Winterfell -
a strong independent woman.

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.780
Arya Stark is a cute little fighter.
 She wanders the countryside,

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.560
and eventually is invited to join the
Faceless Men assassin's guild!

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.720
She trains to become a master assassin, but decides she doesn't like killing random people,

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.840
so she quits and goes home
to kill people for vengeance!

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.840
Bran Stark caught the Lannisters 
twincesting in episode 1,

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.020
so Jaime pushed him out the window!
And now he's crippled.

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.700
but the fall awakened his
psychic tree powers,

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.900
so he travels beyond the wall to Super Tree,

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.060
and trains with the Three-Eyed Raven
to learn how to see the past.

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.540
Down in King's Landing, Cersei has trouble with a militant new religious group

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.380
who makes her do a naked walk of shame
through the streets!

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:27.820
She gets revenge by blowing up the entire church!

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:29.900
All of her enemies in one fell swoop!

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.460
And she names herself Queen on the Iron Throne.

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:36.260
Daenerys is here now to take it from her, and her dragons are fully grown!

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.340
But the real war is up in the North.
Jon Snow's going to fight 'em,

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.580
and Daenerys brings her dragons to help.

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:45.920
But the Night King, FWOOM spear...
Oh! Kills a dragon!

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.860
Cersei agrees to a truce while they all fight
the zombie-pocalypse, but of course she was lying!

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.100
Her brother Jaime's been on a series-long redemption arc ever since he got his hand cut off.

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.520
So he bails on his sister-girlfriend,
and rides north on his own.

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:02.480
Jon Snow and Daenerys are both really hot,
so they get it on!

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:07.180
But, turns out Jon Snow is not Ned Stark's son,
it was his sister Lyanna Stark's son,

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.860
And his father was Rhaegar Targaryen!

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.800
Oh! That makes Jon Snow
the true king of the Iron Throne!

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.760
Hilariously this makes him Daenerys' nephew, but they don't know that yet,

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.160
and aunt-nephew incest is relatively tame for Game of Thrones - we're ok with it.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.700
And now the army of the dead is marching south.

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.780
Luckily there's a huge Wall in the way, there's no way they could get past that...

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:31.900
Unless they had a dead dragon lying around that they could resurrect as a zombie dragon!

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.380
BOOM! Blue flame! And The Wall comes crashing down!

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:39.460
The army of the dead is marching on Westeros,
and Winter has come!

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.900
So there you have it, now you're basically caught up for the final season--

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.600
Except there's about a hundred important
characters I didn't even get to mention,

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.760
and a lot of fun interesting
plot points I totally skimmed over!

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.480
So if your interest is piqued,
go watch my big recap!

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.440
I go into full detail so it 
feels like a real rewatch.

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.540
Plus I'm in costume! How fun is that!?
