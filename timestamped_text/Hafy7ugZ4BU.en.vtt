00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.360
Welcome to the Man of Recaps, this is ALL
seven seasons of Game of Thrones,

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:06.640
leading up to the eighth and final season!

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.860
It starts way up in the North at Winterfell,
Lord Ned Stark is in command,

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:11.780
he's the one who says
"Winter is Coming".

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.180
He's a nice family man - Robb Stark's his oldest,
his daughter Sansa's pretty,

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.500
Bran likes to climb things, Arya's a tomboy,
this one doesn't matter,

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.700
and Jon Snow is his bastard son
(no one likes bastards).

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.960
Down in the capital of King's Landing, the
Hand of the King (the 2nd in command) has just died,

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.160
so fat King Rob Baratheon rides
up to his old buddy Ned Stark

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.580
and makes him the new Hand.

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:33.820
The Queen is Cersei Lannister, the Lannisters
are the richest family in the realm

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.900
and she is just the worst.

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.520
She's got a twin brother Jaime Lannister who
is a classic douche-bag.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.780
That night Ned's wife Catelyn gets a letter
from her sister saying that the

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.980
the Hand of the King was
murdered by the Lannisters!

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.320
The Lannisters are certainly up to something,
they're up to each other!

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.850
Oh it's Twincest, what!?

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.100
And to hide their secret Jaime pushes Bran
out the window!

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.320
Dick move.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.940
Bran survives, he's in a coma though, so everyone
else is going down to King's Landing.

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.900
Except for Jon Snow, they're sending him to
join the Night's Watch,

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.380
who guard The Wall 
from the terrors beyond.

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:10.100
Basically just Wildling barbarians, but also
maybe the White Walkers who can raise ice zombies!

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.020
Don't worry about them though,
that's just a myth.

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.580
Before he goes Jon's like
"Hey Pops who's my mom by the way?"

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.820
and he's like "Yo, it's way too early in the series
for you to find that out."

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.909
Now across the Narrow Sea is Daenerys Targaryen.

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.079
The Targaryens ruled Westeros for hundreds
of years, until the current king Rob Baratheon

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.140
rebelled against their father the mad king
Aerys.

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.990
Now Daenerys and her brother are in exile as the
last two Targaryens.

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.980
In exchange for his help reconquering the
realm, they're marrying Daenerys to

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.600
Khal Drogo, leader of the Dothraki.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.640
You're heard Daenerys called "Khaleesi", it's
her title, he's the Khal, she's the Khaleesi.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.260
As a wedding present she gets three dragon
eggs. Now, her ancestors used to ride dragons,

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.940
but they've been extinct for hundreds of years
so these are just decorative,

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.420
they definitely won't hatch.

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.740
Back in Westeros Rob Baratheon is a drunken
oaf of a king, so

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.440
it's up to Ned and the
Small Council to hold things together.

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.480
Master of Coin is Petyr Baelish, they call
him "Littlefinger" and he's a

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.540
sleazeball who owns a bunch of brothels.

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.020
And Varys is the Master of Whisperers, he's
basically the CIA,

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.320
he is a eunuch though, no dick or balls.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.400
But up in Winterfell an assassin comes to
kill Bran,

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:13.240
turns out that assassin's dagger belonged to
 Tyrion Lannister!

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.040
Tyrion is the third lannister sibling, he
is the dwarf.

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.780
He loves beer, he loves boobs,

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.140
and he also loves reading because
he's very smart and witty.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.560
Cat runs into him on the road and is like
"arrest this man!"

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.680
We know Tyrion's innocent, but she takes him
to stand trial at the Eyrie

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.420
where her sister lives, and her son is
way too old to be breastfeeding.

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.280
It's clearly a sham trial, so Tyrion demands
trial by combat!

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.060
And Bronn the sell-sword agrees to fight for
him, well because Tyrion's rich.

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:39.640
Luckily Bronn is very good at killing so Tyrion's
free to go.

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.390
Bran wakes up, he doesn't remember anything
about the fall though, and unfortunately he's

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.260
paralyzed from the waist down so he's got
to be carried around by this big guy Hodor,

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.620
who like a Pokemon, can only say his own name.

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.800
Sansa Stark is betrothed to the crown prince
Joffrey, unfortunately at his best

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.060
Joffrey is an insufferable twat, and at his worst,
well, he's a sadistic freak.

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.000
Arya Stark before she left got a sword named
Needle.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Jon tells her to "stick them with the pointy
end" which is pretty good advice,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.800
but she decides to get real sword lessons from her
"dancing master" Syrio Forrell.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.900
So Ned Stark starts investigating the death
of the last Hand of the King.

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.260
He was checking out this blacksmith kid Gendry,
who Ned Stark realizes

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.800
is a bastard son of King Rob Baratheon!

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.220
Ned realizes that every Baratheon in history
has had dark black hair,

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.400
how is Joffrey blonde? 
Twincest!!!

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.900
Ned is merciful and gives Cersei a chance
to flee with her kids,

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.580
but she's like "I don't want your mercy,"

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.860
"When you play the Game
of Thrones you win or you die."

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.440
And Ned never gets a chance to tell the King
because he's wounded by a boar,

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.660
he got too drunk out hunting, classic.

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.360
So Cersei immediately puts Joffrey on the
throne, Ned's like

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.320
"Sorry kid, but you're not the real king."

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.900
Littlefinger promised Ned that the city watch
would be on his side,

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.420
but they start killing Stark men!
Littlefinger betrayed him!

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.720
"I did warn you not to trust me."

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.720
So up in the North Robb Stark calls the banners,
the North is going to war!

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.150
The Lannisters mobilize too, they're led by
big bad daddy Tywin Lannister.

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.700
He and Jaime split up their forces, but Robb
Stark outsmarts them and takes Jaime prisoner!

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.460
Now it's time for Ned Stark's trial.

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:07.400
In order to save his family he "confesses"
to his "treason"

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.460
and admits Joffrey's the real king.

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:13.220
The agreement was he'd be banished to the
Night's Watch, but Joffrey's a wildcard,

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:14.760
"Bring me his head!"

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.360
Oh man, how's Ned Stark gonna
get out of this one,

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:19.640
he's the main character
they can't just kill him,

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.580
but they do, what!?!?

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:25.340
Ned Stark dead!
Oh! First epic twist!

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:29.360
But life goes on. Up at The Wall, Jon Snow
is graduating from wear-black school.

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.100
He's made friends with this fat kid Sam and
they've got a Frodo-Sam thing going on.

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.380
They find a couple rangers' dead bodies, but
they don't stay dead,

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.960
they rise as ice zombies and attack!

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.700
Luckily Jon played video games, he knows fire
is super-effective against ice and zombie.

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.160
And the Night's Watch is like "Wow, if White
Walkers are real,

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.020
we're going to go out there and fight 'em."

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.180
Across the sea Daenerys is finding married
life pretty rough,

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.740
but they eventually fall in love
and she gets pregnant.

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.560
Her brother is a huge prick though and he's
sick of waiting.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:00.400
He demands the crown Khal Drogo promised him,
so Khal Drogo's like "Here's your crown!"

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.580
Molten gold on the face, oh!
He dead.

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:06.940
Daenerys makes friends with Ser Jorah Mormont,
an exiled knight from Westeros.

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.340
At first he's spying on her
in hopes of a pardon,

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:12.680
but he gets a huge crush on her
and becomes fiercely loyal.

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:15.960
Khal Drogo is ready to do some conquering,
but long story short

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.480
before he even starts he gets a cut that gets infected.

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:22.020
This witch is like "I can save him, but it's
a sketchy blood magic ritual."

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:23.960
Just then Dany goes into labor!

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:27.150
And when she wakes up her baby's stillborn
and Khal Drogo's a vegetable.

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.580
She pillows her Khal because that's no fit
life for a Khal,

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.960
and she puts the dragon eggs on his funeral pyre,

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.180
on a whim, walks into the flames!

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:38.090
But she's right, she doesn't burn, and the
dragon eggs hatch!!!

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:41.460
My girl Khaleesi, Mother of Dragons!

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.000
Season 2 follows the War of the Five Kings.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.440
King number 1 is Joffrey, king of the douches,
on the Iron Throne.

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.560
King number 2 is Robb Stark, his lords have
named him "King in the North"

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.320
which they love to chant.

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.920
Kings number 3 and 4 are the Baratheon brothers.

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:58.740
Stannis is older so he's got the better claim,
but Renly's more popular,

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:03.260
and he's got the bigger army because he married Margaery Tyrell of the powerful Tyrell house.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:07.120
She is super hot, but Renly's more interested
in her brother Loras.

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:10.020
Stannis' only friend is Davos Seaworth,
the Onion Knight,

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.560
a bluntly honest adviser
who used to be a smuggler.

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.320
And Melisandre, the Red Priestess, who says

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:18.340
"For the night is dark, and full of terrors."

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:21.960
She believes Stannis is the chosen one so
she has sex with him, and then...

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:26.100
gets pregnant immediately and
gives birth to a shadow baby!

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:29.000
It sneaks into Renly's camp
and assassinates him!

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.980
What dark sorcery is this?!

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:34.250
So most of Renly's army goes to Stannis, except
the Tyrells, who bail.

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:37.700
And Catelyn Stark happened to be there because
Robb had sent her to meet with Renly.

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:41.080
She escapes with Brienne of Tarth, Renly's
giant woman bodyguard, who

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.400
now pledges herself to Catelyn
because YOLO.

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:47.700
King number 5 is late to the party, it's Balon
Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron Islands,

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:49.860
who's just decided to
call himself King now.

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:53.360
He's the father of Theon Greyjoy who's been
around since season 1.

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:56.980
His whole life he's been a hostage at Winterfell
since his father's last rebellion,

00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:00.560
but Ned Stark treated him like one of his own sons,
he grew up like a brother to Robb.

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:03.560
Theon's like "Hey Dad, let's join with my
friend Robb and fight the Lannisters,"

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:07.400
but Balon Greyjoy does what he wants,
he's gonna go attack the North!

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:11.600
So Theon's got a difficult choice: the family
the raised him, or his a-hole real dad,

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:13.540
and he chooses his real dad.

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:16.700
So with all the Northern troops gone,
Theon takes Winterfell no problem.

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:19.320
Bran and his brother escape for a minute,
but they're caught!

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:21.960
And to teach them a lesson, Theon kills them!

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:24.720
What!?  Oh Theon, you done messed up.

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:26.840
When Robb sends some Northmen
to retake Winterfell

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:29.760
Theon's men immediately turn on him
'cause they don't respect him.

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:31.610
And turns out Bran survived!

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:34.940
Theon never actually found him, he burned
some random peasants instead.

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:39.120
Sansa Stark is a hostage in King's Landing,
still engaged to Joffrey but he loves tormenting her.

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:42.280
Arya Stark escaped the city but she's caught
by the Lannisters,

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:44.060
but luckily no one recognizes her.

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:47.000
She makes friends with master assassin, Jaqen
H'ghar!

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
She saved him from a fire so he'll kill any
three people she wants.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.560
She wastes her first two, but then trades
her third for his help escaping the castle.

00:07:53.569 --> 00:07:57.000
He's like "Hey girl, you ever wanna be a master
assassin like me, give this coin to a man

00:07:57.009 --> 00:08:01.379
from Braavos and say the password: 'Valar
Morgulus'," which means "all men must die."

00:08:01.379 --> 00:08:04.550
But now it's Stannis the Mannis, coming to
take King's Landing!

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:07.750
With most of their army fighting the North,
the Lannisters are way outnumbered here.

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:10.920
But Tyrion's got a trick up his sleeve, it's
Wildfire!!!

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:14.200
Oh! Blows up half of Stannis' fleet!

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:16.760
But Stannis survives and he's still got plenty
of army.

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:20.039
Things are looking grim, but then Lannister
reinforcements come!

00:08:20.039 --> 00:08:23.659
It's Big Bad Daddy Tywin, abandoned the Northern
campaign to save the city.

00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:27.500
The Tyrells join their side too now in exchange
for Joffrey marrying Margaery.

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:29.800
Stannis is like "Well that was a pretty big
set back,

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:33.460
but I'm the chosen one, I'm still gonna be king...
 Yes I am..."

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:37.820
Daenerys meanwhile has dragons, but they're
still babies so they don't do much.

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:40.720
She makes it to a city called Qarth, gets
kidnapped by warlocks, but

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:43.700
her dragons can breath enough fire
to burn a warlock!

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:45.220
Don't mess with Khaleesi.

00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:47.240
North of the Wall, Jon Snow's with the Night's
Watch.

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:49.980
They fight some Wildlings, one of whom is
a hot redhead!

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:51.940
Jon loves redheads so he can't kill her.

00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:56.230
Her name is Ygritte and her tagline is
"You know nothing, Jon Snow."

00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:58.720
The Wildlings end up capturing him, and this
other Night's Watchman is like

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:01.120
"Hey if you kill me they'll
accept you as one of their own,

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:04.000
and you can go undercover
in the Wildling army."

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.060
Meanwhile the rest of the Night's Watch are
attacked by Anorexic Santa Claus!!!

00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:12.070
It's a White Walker and he's leading an army
of ice zombies!

00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:16.220
The Night's Watch barely survives and make
it back to Craster's Keep for shelter.

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:20.560
Craster is a D-bag Wildling who's got a bunch
of daughters - that are also his wives.

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:24.610
Sam gets a huge crush on one of them named
Gilly, who just gives birth to a son.

00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:27.220
And when a Night's Watch mutiny
breaks out they escape,

00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:30.400
but a White Walker comes 'cause
they're attracted to the scent of baby.

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:32.940
Normal weapons do not work
against these things, but

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:35.400
Sam found a bunch of
Dragon-Glass daggers, tries that...

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:37.860
Oh! It's super effective!
Good to know.

00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:40.660
Down in King's Landing Tywin Lannister's
 running the show.

00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:44.180
Margaery's engaged to Joffrey now instead
of Sansa, and she can handle him just fine.

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:47.720
But now that Sansa's single they make 
Tyrion Lannister marry her!

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:50.920
It's awkward for everyone, but he's a nice
guy, he doesn't consummate it.

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:54.740
Especially because he's got a hot whore named
Shae that he's fallen in love with.

00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:58.040
His brother Jaime Lannister has been a prisoner
of Robb Stark this whole time.

00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:00.360
By the way they call him
the "Kingslayer" because

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:02.900
he's the one who killed
Mad King Aerys Targaryen.

00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:06.820
Thing is though he was on the Kingsguard,
so that's a big no-no.

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:10.360
But Catelyn Stark lets him go, she sends Brienne
to take him to King's Landing

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:12.560
as a hostage exchange
for her daughters.

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:17.100
They're recaptured though, and long story
short they cut off Jaime Lannister's hand!!!

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:20.430
Arya's picked up by some Robin Hood wannabes
- the Brotherhood without Banners.

00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:23.240
They also pick up The Hound, Sandor Clegane!

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:26.780
He was Joffrey's bodyguard and he's a mean
scary guy with a burnt face,

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:28.720
but he's secretly a softy.

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:31.140
Long story short he kidnaps Arya,
but it's not bad,

00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:33.080
he's gonna take her to her
family for ransom.

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:35.720
They have a fun dynamic - she's like
"Hey, no killing," and he's like

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:38.380
"I am programmed to obey John Connor,
must not kill."

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:42.080
Robb Stark's been busy with war, he meets
a hot nurse chick one day and they

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:45.660
amputate a foot together, which turns him on,
they fall in love.

00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:48.520
But that's a problem because in season 1,
to cross this bridge

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:51.440
he promised to marry one of
old Walder Frey's ugly daughters.

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:54.570
He decides "Screw it, I'll marry for love,
what's the worst that could happen?"

00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:57.260
He offers his uncle Edmure Tully to
marry in his place, and

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.540
turns out the girl's super hot -
your loss Robb.

00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:03.840
They have a real nice wedding, until someone
requests the Lannister theme song...

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:07.780
Wait what's this? Oh no!
Stabbed in the baby!!!

00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:10.160
Robb Stark shot with crossbows!?! Oh!

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.900
The Freys are killing all the Stark men!

00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:16.120
It's the Red Wedding,
 Walder Frey's revenge!

00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:21.760
One of Robb's lords Roose Bolton was in on
it too - "The Lannisters send their regards."

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:24.450
Yes, Robb Stark is all the way dead.

00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:28.700
So is Catelyn (in the show), and it was all
set up by Tywin Lannister.

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:32.700
Life goes on though - beyond the Wall, Jon
Snow undercover with the Wildling army.

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:36.110
He and Ygritte start doing it when they find
a sexy Jacuzzi cave.

00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:39.410
But when she finds out he's an undercover
cop she shoots him!

00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:42.000
It was just a love prick though, he'll be
fine.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.080
Daenerys got herself a boat, she stops at
the slave city of Astapor to

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:48.140
buy an army called the Unsullied.
She trades a dragon for the army,

00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:50.820
then it's like "OK army,
I free you, kill the masters!"

00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:53.240
"What, that's not allowed!"
But apparently it is!

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:56.600
Then she's like "Dracarys", and the dragon's
breathing fire!

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:59.100
She takes what she wants
with fire and blood,

00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:01.010
now she's got dragons and an army!

00:12:01.010 --> 00:12:03.820
In King's Landing Joffrey marries Margaery,
and he's real happy

00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:06.160
because he's basically won
the War of the Five Kings.

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:09.480
But then he starts choking, and oh!
Someone poisoned him!

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:11.520
Yeah, serves him right!

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:16.199
Unfortunately Tyrion looks really guilty,
but the real murderer was Littlefinger!

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:19.400
He wisks Sansa away and explains it was
 him and Grandma Tyrell,

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:22.300
who didn't want Margaery marrying
such a little monster.

00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:27.020
The new king is Joffrey's little brother Tommen,
who is a real nice kid, and easy to control.

00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:31.260
So Tyrion is on trial, and everyone who's
ever been on the show says he's really guilty.

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:34.160
Including his whore Shae!
Oh, the betrayal!

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:37.840
Realizing he's not gonna get a fair trial,
he falls back to what saved him last time--

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:41.060
"I demand a trial by combat!"

00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:46.480
Cersei is fine with this, because her champion
is the Mountain, Gregor Clegane!

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:48.400
He is a monster of a man!

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:51.180
Incidentally the Hound's older brother,
and the one that burned his face.

00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:54.480
Jaime can't fight for his brother with one
hand, he still sucks with his left.

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:57.180
And Bronn won't fight for him this time because
Cersei paid him not to.

00:12:57.180 --> 00:12:58.840
It's like "Sorry friend, good luck."

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:01.960
But Oberyn Martell, the Red Viper, is in town.

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:05.260
He's out for vengeance against the man who
murdered his sister and her children,

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.660
which happens to be the Mountain.

00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:10.440
So during their fight he goes all
Inigo Montoya:

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:12.900
"You raped her, you murdered her, you
killed her children!"

00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:15.300
And - oh!!! 
Oberyn wins!!!

00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:18.720
For about five seconds, until the Mountain
knocks him off his feet

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:22.060
and crushes his head in!!!
Oh, oh god...

00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:24.200
So Tyrion is sentenced to death.

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:28.020
His brother Jaime breaks him out though, and
Tryion takes a detour to his father's room,

00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:31.560
where he finds Shae in his dad's bed!

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:34.320
Oh, the betrayal!
Tyrion strangles her!

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:36.780
Then he pays a visit to his
Pops on the Pooper.

00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:39.060
Tywin is still mean to him, even now,

00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:42.480
so Tyrion shoots him with
a crossbow, gangster style!

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:44.800
Now Jaime swore to trade
himself for Sansa Stark,

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:46.620
but now her mom's dead
and Sansa's missing,

00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:48.880
so he sends Brienne to go try to
uphold the vow.

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:52.020
She goes to find Sansa and takes Tyrion's
old squire Podrick Payne.

00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:56.120
She doesn't find Sansa, but she does find
Arya Stark, who's travelling with the Hound.

00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:58.300
Since all her family was killed he's got no
one to ransom her to,

00:13:58.300 --> 00:13:59.920
so they're just wandering around.

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:02.480
They have a bar fight over some chickens,
and Arya pivots from

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:04.740
"No killing" to "Yes, all the killing."

00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:07.560
Brienne and the Hound both want to protect
her, but they don't trust each other so they

00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:10.890
end up fighting, and Brienne punches him off
a mountain!

00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:13.360
Seems like he's gonna die, so Arya finds a
ship to Braavos.

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:15.340
"Braavos? I got the quest item for that!"

00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:18.380
The coin Jaqen H'ghar gave me, and the password
"Valar Morghulis."

00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:20.370
Well that works, so she's off on a ship.

00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:21.640
Where is Sansa?

00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:24.770
Littlefinger took her to the Vale, that's
her breast-feeding aunt's castle.

00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:28.320
And whereas Littlefinger always loved Catelyn,
her sister always loved Littlefinger!

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:32.110
And she reveals an epic secret: the letter
she sent to Cat at the beginning of the series

00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:34.460
claiming that the Lannisters murdered the
Hand of the King?

00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:38.260
It was her and Littlefinger who killed him
and blamed it on the Lannisters!

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:41.380
Yes, Petyr Baelish incited the whole conflict
of the series,

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:45.140
because he thrives on chaos.
"Chaos is a ladder."

00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:48.360
But Littlefinger never liked this sister,
he always loved Cat,

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:51.620
so he throws her out
the Moon Door, woah!

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:55.080
But now his crush on Catelyn is transferring
to her daughter Sansa!

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:58.040
She's like "Woah dude, you're too old, and
that's a little creepy."

00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:01.350
But she stays friends with him for now as
he basically takes control of the Vale.

00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:05.500
Now ever since his fall, Bran Stark has been
having dreams about a three-eyed raven.

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:07.600
So he ditches the little brother
that doesn't matter,

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:10.560
and long story short goes to Super Tree
beyond the Wall.

00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:14.040
It's guarded by skeletons, so Bran uses his
new Warg powers

00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:17.980
to Warg inside of Hodor's body
and do some skeleton bashing!

00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:22.040
Inside he finds the Three-Eyed Raven, Tree
Gandalf, who's gonna teach him tree magic.

00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:27.230
Up at the Wall Jon Snow has to defend against
the Wildling army, including giants and mammoths.

00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:30.180
It's an epic battle, and soon he's face to
face with Ygritte.

00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:33.180
But she won't kill him, but someone else
will shoot her!

00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:35.160
No! Olly, come on!

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:37.880
She dies in Jon Snow's arms and it's so sad.

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:41.280
The Night's Watch gets some reinforcements
from Stannis the Mannis!

00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:42.960
He got the letter asking for help,
and he's like

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:44.780
"Well I lost in the south,
may as well go north!"

00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:48.080
Daenerys conquers her next city, Meereen,
and frees all the slaves -

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:49.980
no mercy for the masters though.

00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:53.920
She could sail to Westeros, but she realizes
if she bails they're just gonna start slaving again,

00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:55.980
so she decides to stay and rule.

00:15:55.980 --> 00:16:00.000
She starts banging her hot sell-sword captain,
Daario Naharis - sploosh.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.140
Jorah's still in love with her, but he's been
friend-zoned.

00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:06.440
And when she finds out Jorah used to spy on her,
he's banished from the friend-zone!

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:08.480
And all zones, the whole city in fact.

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:12.120
Now with Big Bad Daddy Tywin Lannister dead,
Cersei's running the show again.

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:16.460
Until Tommen marries Margaery, and with sex,
she can control the king.

00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:20.900
The two queens vie for power, so Cersei appoints
a fanatical new High Septon,

00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:23.660
tells him that Loras Tyrell is gay,
so he's under arrest,

00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:25.460
and so is Margaery by association!

00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:27.960
Cersei's feeling pretty good about herself,
until she realizes

00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:30.339
her cousin Lancel Lannister
is one of them.

00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:34.320
They banged a few times - she has a type - 
so she's thrown in prison too!

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:37.060
They make her do a naked walk of shame
through the streets,

00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:39.320
where they ring the bell
and chant "shame" at her.

00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:42.020
But when she gets back, she has a huge new
bodyguard!

00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:44.200
The Mountain was dying after the
trial by combat,

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:47.440
but Cersei's mad scientist friend Qyburn
 does some freaky Frankenstein stuff,

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:49.480
and brings him back to life...-ish.

00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:52.600
Tyrion makes it across the sea;
Varys is gonna go join team Daenerys,

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:54.340
he wants Tyrion to come.

00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:57.660
But he's kidnapped by Jorah Mormont, hoping
to get himself un-banished.

00:16:57.660 --> 00:17:00.720
They get kidnapped by slavers and have to
fight in the Colosseum,

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:03.139
where Jorah stops an
assassination attempt!

00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:07.660
The Sons of the Harpy are trying to take their
city back, they're all surrounded, but then,

00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:11.540
Drogon flies in! OH a dragon!
Burning all of them!

00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:14.460
Daenerys jumps on his back and flies away!

00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:16.840
She's flying on a dragon!
Epic!

00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:18.760
He drops her off in the wilderness though,

00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:21.380
and she doesn't have enough
gym badges to make it fly her back.

00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:24.140
Now after the Red Wedding, the traitor Roose
Bolton took the North,

00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:26.300
with his bastard son Ramsey Snow.

00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:28.660
Ramsey's got a surprise, it's a Theon Greyjoy!

00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:31.700
Ramsey's the one who captured him, and he
loves torture.

00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:35.410
Spent a whole season torturing Theon, even
cut off his dick - sorry Theon.

00:17:35.410 --> 00:17:39.120
And now he's named him "Reek," and Theon is
a shell of a human being.

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:41.680
Littlefinger somehow convinces Sansa
to marry this guy,

00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:44.280
because he's just playing
all sides at all times.

00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:48.020
But no one knew Ramsey was a monster, and
she's basically kept as a prisoner.

00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:52.040
Stannis the Mannis hasn't given up, he's going
to conquer the realm from the top down.

00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:56.760
But when his army is totally snowed-in, Melisandre's
like "Hey, we need a sacrifice of king's blood."

00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:59.140
They've done this before with Gendry, the
old king's bastard,

00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:02.400
they leech some blood out
and sacrifice it to the Lord of Light.

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:06.480
But Davos sent him away before they decided
it'd be more effective to burn the whole thing.

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:11.120
They do have some more king's blood around
though - Stannis' daughter Shireen!

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:13.980
Stannis loves his daughter, but he has
a duty to the realm,

00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:16.920
so he lets Melisandre burn her! No!!!

00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:20.460
Stannis, why!?
I revoke your title of "the Mannis."

00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:23.820
The sacrifice works though, the snows melt,
but his whole army deserts him

00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:26.320
'cause they don't want to follow a guy
who burns his daughter.

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:29.950
Stannis may have the Lord of Light on his
side, but he doesn't have any cavalry left,

00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:31.400
so he's defeated for good.

00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:33.520
The Night's Watch is electing a
new Lord Commander,

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:36.160
Sam's like "Hey Jon's the main character,
we should vote for him."

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:39.210
He goes to the new Wildling leader, the funny
ginger Tormund Giantsbane.

00:18:39.210 --> 00:18:41.640
It's like "Hey we should be bros to fight
against the White Walkers."

00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:47.090
He sails to Hardhome to recruit more Wildlings,
but winter is coming - it's a zombie attack!

00:18:47.090 --> 00:18:51.680
It's an epic battle, killing zombies, but
then a White Walker shows up!

00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:55.720
Normal weapons still won't work, but Jon grabs
Longclaw - Valyrian steel...

00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:59.320
BOOM, blocks it!
And then slash - explodes him!

00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:02.800
As they're escaping they see
Albino Darth Maul!

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:05.460
He's the Night King,
the White Walker leader,

00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:08.560
and he raises everyone they just killed
to join his un-dead army.

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:11.400
So Winter just came all over the place.

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:13.920
Jon brings the surviving Wildlings
through the Wall,

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:16.600
but some of the Night's Watch think
this is an act of treason,

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:19.660
so they Julius Caesar him!
"For the Watch."

00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:21.800
And Jon Snow is bleeding out!

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:24.720
I mean, I know they killed Ned Stark
in season 1, but Jon Snow's like

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:27.720
the MAIN main character now,
they can't actually kill him, right?

00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:29.700
But it cuts to black!

00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:31.780
So Jon Snow is dead.

00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:35.420
Melisandre's hanging around the Wall, she's
got the best boobs in the show by the way,

00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:39.160
unless she takes off her magic necklace and
is a million years old, what?!

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:42.680
But turns out Jon's only "mostly dead," so
she's able to Miracle Max him,

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:46.600
and BOOM Jon Snow!
Resurrected with fire magic!

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:49.120
He's like "Look, I've spent
five seasons up here in the cold,

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:50.840
I think I've earned a beach vacation."

00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:52.820
But just then Sansa shows up.

00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:55.700
She and Theon escaped from Winterfell last
season, met up with Brienne,

00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:58.420
who Tormund has a huge crush on,
so watch out for that plot line.

00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:00.740
Ramsey Snow killed his dad and took over,

00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:03.500
and he's captured their
youngest brother! (Who doesn't matter).

00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:07.160
So it's the Battle of the Bastards -
Jon Snow versus Ramsey Snow!

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:09.600
Ramsey starts out by
shooting the youngest Stark!

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:11.480
Turns out he really never mattered.

00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:16.020
And then it's time for a battle scene -
the best one yet, It's super epic!

00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:19.620
The good guys are way outnumbered though,
and just when all hope seems lost,

00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:22.220
Sansa shows up with Littlefinger!

00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:24.500
And the knights of the Vale ride in and win!

00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:27.600
The northern lords meet and it's like "Hey,
Jon Snow, King in the North?"

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:30.520
"King in the North!!!"
Yeah, they really love chanting that.

00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:34.040
Now Arya Stark made it to Braavos,
meets up with her friend Jaqen

00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:36.400
and joins the Faceless Men
assassin guild!

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:38.560
So named because
they can change their faces.

00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:41.920
Long story short she trains to
become a master assassin,

00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:44.920
but she screws up her first mission
by killing the wrong person,

00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:47.400
then screws up the second one
by befriending her mark.

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:50.700
She decides she'd rather go home and kill
the people she wants to kill,

00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:53.620
starting with Lord Walder Frey
of the Red Wedding!

00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:58.940
She slits his throat and then uses his identity
to poison all the rest of the Freys!

00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:01.160
Woah, Arya's kinda scary now.

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:04.420
Bran Stark's been hanging in a tree with the
Three-Eyed Raven, learning how to

00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:07.340
trip out on tree roots and have
spirit quests of the past.

00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:09.560
He sees his father, a young Ned Stark,

00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:12.360
during Robert's Rebellion against
the Mad King Aerys Targaryen.

00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:15.140
The prince Rhaegar Targaryen kidnapped
his sister Lyanna Stark

00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:16.820
and has her hidden in the tower.

00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:19.480
They have an epic fight, then,
what's in the tower?

00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:21.470
It's too big a reveal, we don't find out yet!

00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:24.300
Then the White Walkers show up and kill the
Three-Eyed Raven!

00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:27.220
Bran and co escape, but the
zombies are hot on their tail,

00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:29.160
so it's like "Hodor, hold the door!"

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:33.680
But because Bran's mind is still in the past,
he managers to Warg Hodor in the past,

00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:36.860
gives him a seizure, he starts yelling
"Hold the door! Hold the door!"

00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:39.080
Which devolves into "Hodor!"

00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:44.080
And it's like "Oh, I broke Hodor's brain as
part of a time travel paradox. Whoops."

00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:46.440
But Hodor holds that door like a champ.

00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:49.480
Down in King's Landing, Margaery's still a
prisoner of the faith.

00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:53.660
The High Septon agrees to let her go, if she
announces the merger of church and state.

00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:56.800
Tommen's like "I have no idea what's going
on, I'm just trying to get laid again."

00:21:56.800 --> 00:22:00.150
Cersei's walk of shame was just her bail,
she still needs to come face trial.

00:22:00.150 --> 00:22:03.370
But with her big new bodyguard, no one can
make her go anywhere.

00:22:03.370 --> 00:22:07.970
In fact, underneath the Sept is a butt-load
of leftover Wildfire!

00:22:07.970 --> 00:22:09.690
BOOM it explodes!!!

00:22:09.690 --> 00:22:11.700
Blows up the whole Sept!

00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:15.240
All of Cersei's enemies - and a bunch of the
city - in one shot!

00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:17.420
Yeah Cersei, you a bad girl.

00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:20.160
Margaery was in there too,
so when Tommen sees that

00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:24.160
he's like "Hold on Margaery, I'm coming!
I hope there's sex in the afterlife!"

00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:26.780
Cersei's daughter Myrcella is also dead,

00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:29.940
poisoned as revenge for Oberyn
as part of the whole Dorne plot.

00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:33.820
So with no living children, Cersei just crowns
herself Queen on the Iron Throne!

00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:38.000
Daenerys gets herself captured by some Dothraki,
but she gathers all the Khals together.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.300
It's like "Remember season 1
how I'm immune to fire?"

00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:42.920
Oh! Burns all the Khals!

00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:45.760
Walks out unharmed, looking hot and naked!

00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:48.220
All the Dothraki are like "Yeah, we're gonna
follow her."

00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:50.400
While she's been gone, Tyrion's running Meereen.

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:54.940
He's pretty good at it - 
"That's what I do. I drink, and I know things."

00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:58.540
But the slavers try to reconquer the city,
so when Daenerys gets back,

00:22:58.540 --> 00:23:01.160
she unleashes all three dragons!

00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:05.680
They make an example of this ship in particular,
because she commandeers the rest.

00:23:05.690 --> 00:23:10.160
And after six seasons of waiting, Daenerys
is sailing for Westeros!

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:13.740
She lands at Dragonstone, the ancestral seat
of House Targaryen.

00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:16.760
Now Sam Tarly has gone to college
to become a Maester,

00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:20.020
he sees in a book that Dragonstone has a
huge deposit of Dragon-Glass,

00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:21.920
the stuff that kills White Walkers.

00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:25.320
So Jon Snow goes to meet with
Daenerys Targaryen!

00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:29.040
Main characters at opposite ends of the plot
have finally connected!

00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:33.580
Daenerys has a long list of titles, the Mother
of Dragons, the Breaker of Chains, the Un-burnt.

00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:35.900
Jon's recruited Davos as his hype-man,
and he just says

00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:38.560
"This is Jon Snow... he's a right-proper lad."

00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:41.300
Jon's like "Hey Dany, you wanna come help
me fight the White Walkers?"

00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:44.110
She's like "I don't know what that is, so
I'm going to ignore it."

00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:46.940
Cersei is now queen of all Seven Kingdoms,
but in name only,

00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:49.800
because the Tyrells and Dorne
have sided with Daenerys.

00:23:49.810 --> 00:23:54.170
Cersei finds a new ally, it's Euron Greyjoy,
the rock-star pirate!

00:23:54.170 --> 00:23:57.890
He's Balon's younger brother, and decides
that Balon has lived long enough.

00:23:57.890 --> 00:24:01.780
The Iron Islands hold a Kingsmoot to elect
a new leader, Theon's sister Yara seems like

00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:03.980
a good choice, Theon's over there
too to support her.

00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:07.320
But Euron walks in and basically pulls a Trump,
so they elect him

00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:09.400
to make the Iron Islands great again.

00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:11.840
So Theon and Yara stole some ships
and joined Daenerys,

00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:15.860
but Euron crashes into them
and goes into full beast mode!

00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:19.200
He captures Yara, and Theon is still not recovered
from being Reek,

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:21.060
so he bails, he survives though.

00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:25.300
So Euron returns triumphant, "Hey Cersei,
got you a present" - sploosh.

00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:29.790
She even agrees to marry him after the war,
but twincest is still happening by the way.

00:24:29.790 --> 00:24:33.040
In fact, Cersei claims to be pregnant, what!?

00:24:33.050 --> 00:24:35.450
Well another incest baby, congrats I guess?

00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:39.250
Now Tyrion has a plan to capture Casterly
Rock, the seat of Lannister power.

00:24:39.250 --> 00:24:43.840
By the way, Daenerys' Unsullied captain Grey
Worm has a romance with her advisor Missandei.

00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:46.820
Which is good because there's been a severe
lack of boobs in recent seasons.

00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:50.480
We might even see some dick, except that all
the Unsullied are eunuchs.

00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:52.040
It's OK though, they work it out.

00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:55.460
They capture the castle, but there's nothing
here, Jaime took the Lannister army

00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:58.120
the other way and captured the Tyrell castle!

00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:02.240
They capture all the Tyrell gold, which is
good because the Lannisters were almost out,

00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:03.840
and gold wins wars.

00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:06.560
Some of the gold goes to Bronn, who's still
helping out,

00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:08.460
but Jaime promised him one day
he'll get a castle.

00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:12.000
Daenerys is sick of messing around, so she
sends the Dothraki horde,

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.400
and rides a dragon into battle!

00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:16.860
In case you're wondering
how effective dragons are,

00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:19.200
it's basically like having a nuclear bomb.

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:22.960
When it lands, Jaime's like "I can take a
dragon," and he charges!

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:26.420
Just when he realizes he's made a huge mistake,
Bronn tackles him into the water,

00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:28.360
and they swim away from the battle.

00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:31.240
It's like "You're not allowed to die 'til
I get my castle."

00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:34.390
Daenerys rounds up the survivors, "Bend the
knee or be eaten by a dragon."

00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:38.040
Randyll Tarly refuses to surrender, 
yeah that's Sam Tarly's dad,

00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:40.220
don't feel bad for him though, he's an a-hole.

00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:43.300
Sam's brother though is kind of a nice guy,
Tyrion's like "Hey, maybe some mercy?"

00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:46.520
But she's like "Nah, no mercy," and BOOM burned
by dragon,

00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:48.640
that gets the rest of the
knees bending real quick.

00:25:48.650 --> 00:25:53.200
Now the White Walkers are still coming, Jon's
like "Hey Daenerys come on, it's now or never."

00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:56.610
But she's still in the middle of a war, so
Tyrion has a crazy idea.

00:25:56.610 --> 00:25:59.420
If they can capture a zombie and
show it to Cersei,

00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:02.000
she might believe the threat is real
and agree to a truce.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.000
Jon's like "That idea seems dumb...

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.940
...but I guess there's only one season left,
we gotta wrap things up."

00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:09.300
So Jon Snow assembles his dream team!

00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:12.460
the Suicide Squad of Westeros
going to capture a zombie.

00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:15.840
There's the Wildling Tormund of course, but
also the Hound!

00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:18.320
He survived his fall and
joined a hippie commune,

00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:20.860
but they all died so he went on a
revenge murder spree,

00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:22.840
ran into the Brotherhood without
Banners,

00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:24.880
and they gave him booze and chicken
so he joined.

00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:27.700
Jorah Mormont's there too, he caught Greyscale
for awhile but,

00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:30.180
long story short Sam cured it
and that didn't matter.

00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:32.740
Then there's Gendry, the king's blacksmith
bastard.

00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:35.300
We thought he rowed his way
right out of the show,

00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:38.780
but he's back and he's got a new
memorable shtick -  he's the hammer guy.

00:26:38.780 --> 00:26:41.220
So the guy's ambush some zombies
and take one captive,

00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:43.860
but the army of the dead is close behind them!

00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:45.660
Jon sent Gendry to run ahead and get help.

00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:47.720
He's been rowing for
three straight seasons,

00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:50.220
so he has incredible cardio
and gets there in time.

00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:52.460
But the rest of them have to fight some zombies.

00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:54.560
Things are not looking good,
but then,

00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:56.940
Dragons show up! Yeah!

00:26:56.940 --> 00:27:00.880
And as I've said before, fire is super-effective
against ice and zombie.

00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:04.880
The Night King though has a trick up his sleeve,
he throws a javelin and...

00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:07.100
OH!!! Dragon in the neck!

00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:09.800
No, dragons can't die! But it does!

00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:13.000
Super sad, but the rest of them manage to
get away.

00:27:13.010 --> 00:27:17.240
They go to King's Landing for the truce meeting,
where the Hound and the Mountain face off.

00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:21.980
The Hound hates his brother for burning his
face, so next season, Clegane-Bowl confirmed!

00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:24.940
They show everyone that zombies are undeniably
real.

00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:29.080
Seeing this Cersei agrees to the truce, and
in fact will help them fight the White Walkers!

00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:30.900
Well, that went really well.

00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:34.960
Except of course she's lying, she's happy
to let them and the White Walkers kill each other.

00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:38.900
In fact, she sent Euron Greyjoy on a secret
mission to pick up a bunch of mercenaries.

00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:42.360
But Jaime has been on a seven-season long
redemption arc.

00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:46.050
He's trying to be honorable these days, and
realizes that Cersei is the worst.

00:27:46.050 --> 00:27:48.540
So he rides off by himself to help,

00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:51.520
and Cersei has driven away the one person
that truly loved her.

00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:55.060
Meanwhile Bran Stark made it back to Winterfell,
but he's a weird tree-wizard now,

00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:58.880
and Arya made it back to Winterfell
but she's a crazy master assassin.

00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:01.550
Sansa's like "What the hell happened to my
younger siblings?"

00:28:01.550 --> 00:28:05.850
Littlefinger slides in there, hoping to sow
distrust between them so Sansa will need him.

00:28:05.850 --> 00:28:10.200
He and Arya try to out-sneak each other, and
in the end it looks like he won!

00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:13.360
Sansa calls her sister for trial, "You stand
accused of treason...

00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:14.460
Lord Baelish!!!"

00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:16.200
What!? The fake-out!

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:18.940
"Yeah we talked off-screen bro, we know you're
trying to mess with us."

00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:22.360
Plus, Bran re-watched season 1 on H-Tree-O,

00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:25.900
and he saw that Littlefinger was the one that
betrayed their father in the first place.

00:28:25.910 --> 00:28:28.400
So the Stark children execute him!

00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:30.580
Littlefinger, master schemer, dead.

00:28:30.580 --> 00:28:32.120
Sam makes it to Winterfell too,

00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:35.120
and Bran's like "Hey, let's check out what
actually happened in that tower."

00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:38.060
As expected it's Ned's kidnapped
sister Lyanna Stark.

00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:40.760
But, she wasn't kidnapped, she loved Rhaegar!

00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:43.080
They ran off together and got married!

00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:45.300
And they had a baby.

00:28:45.309 --> 00:28:47.890
That baby is - Jon Snow!!!

00:28:47.890 --> 00:28:50.940
That's right, Ned lied all these years to
protect him.

00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:52.900
It's not his son, it's his sister's,

00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:57.760
and he's not a bastard, he's the
true-born son of Rhaegar Targaryen!

00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:01.900
This makes Jon Snow the
rightful heir to the Iron Throne!

00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:03.840
Mind blown! What!?!

00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:08.160
Hilariously this also makes him Daenerys'
nephew, but these two don't know that,

00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:11.120
and they get it on! Oh!

00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:14.800
Aunt-Nephew incest is pretty tame for Game
of Thrones, so, we're all OK with it.

00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:18.660
But meanwhile at the Wall, the White Walkers
have arrived.

00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:21.410
Of course the Wall's pretty tall, there's
no way to get over it.

00:29:21.410 --> 00:29:27.330
Unless they dredged up a dead dragon and managed
to resurrect it as an ice-zombie dragon!

00:29:27.330 --> 00:29:29.340
Oh they did! What!?!

00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:33.200
Breathing blue flame all up on the Wall,
exploding it!

00:29:33.210 --> 00:29:35.700
The Wall comes crashing down!

00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:39.800
And the White Walkers, with the army of the
dead, are marching south!

00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:41.840
Winter. Has. Come.
