00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.220
Hi guys, Korean Movie Recapped here.

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.070
Before we start, WARNING!

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:14.110
Spoilers Ahead!

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:19.279
Today, I’m going to recap a 2010 Korean
Thriller movie called I Saw the Devil.

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:23.880
A young lady who is the daughter of an ex-chief
of police is murdered in a particularly gruesome

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.270
fashion by a serial killer.

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:30.850
Unknown to that serial killer, that lady was
recently engaged to a Korean secret agent.

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:33.260
Can he escape his wrath?

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.430
The story starts with Joo-yeon, talking to
her fiance on the phone.

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.769
Her fiance is Soo-hyun, an agent for the National
Intelligence Service.

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:45.979
He is so busy with his job that he can’t
be with her on her birthday that day.

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:50.540
She is stranded at the side of the road because
her car has broken down in the snow.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.370
Soo-hyun tells her to lock herself in the
car until the tow truck comes.

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:59.320
She is approached by a suspicious stranger
parked nearby, asking if she needs help.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.500
She follows Soo-hyun’s instructions and
declines the stranger's offer.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.230
After a while, she notices that the stranger's
car hasn’t moved away.

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:12.110
Suddenly, the stranger busts the car’s window
with a hammer and attacks her, making her

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:13.490
unconscious.

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.020
In the stranger’s hideout, she is tortured
quite brutally.

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.990
She begs him to spare her life because she
is pregnant.

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.710
But he kills her anyway.

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.850
Her engagement ring falls into the drainage
when the killer dismembers her body.

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:31.620
A few days later, an ear is found in a plastic
bag by a group of kids playing near a river.

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:35.720
The police send a team to comb the scene and
find Joo-yeon’s head in the river.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.040
Her father, who is an ex-chief of police,
is devastated by it.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.290
Soo-hyun arrives at the scene and witnesses
his fiance's decapitated head.

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.000
At the funeral, they both can’t hold their
grief.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.950
So-hyun regrets that he can’t be there for
her.

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.180
But behind his sadness, lies a fire of rage.

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.979
He decides to take the path of revenge.

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.300
He goes to his superior to take a leave of
absence from work.

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.700
One of his subordinates sneaks out a special
tool for him, a capsule tracker equipped with

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.800
GPS and a microphone.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.690
Joo-yeon’s father gives him the investigation
file that the police have so far on the case.

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.090
They have 4 main suspects.

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.760
This time, he will take matters into his own
hands.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.610
He tracks the first suspect and meets him
in his apartment.

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.620
He beats him to get a confession.

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:26.069
He confesses to killing another person, but
he is not the one Soo-hyun is looking for.

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.780
After handing him over to the police, he goes
to the second suspect.

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.660
Unfortunately, that person is not the one
he is looking for too.

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.400
He then goes back home, but he feels so frustrated
that he can’t even get some rest.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.500
He decides to do more investigation to track
the third suspect.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.400
Meanwhile, the serial killer is on the hunt
again.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.050
He kidnaps another woman and kills her.

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.700
Soo-hyun goes to the third suspect’s family
to get more clues.

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.200
Even his family doesn’t know his whereabouts.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.210
He abandoned his parents and left his son
with them.

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:02.230
After talking to the son, he finally discovers
the location of the third suspect’s hideout.

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:07.750
He searches the house and finds a bunch of
women's bags, undies, shoes, and other accessories

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.650
inside a locked cabinet.

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.980
He also discovers a room with bloodstains
on the floor.

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:18.160
After further inspection, he manages to find
Joo-yeon’s engagement ring inside the drainage.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.500
At that moment he realizes that he found the
killer.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.080
The killer's name is Kyung-chul, a driver
at a learning center.

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.110
The police also find out about his identity
and immediately rush there.

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.130
But it’s too late, he is already on the
way to delivering the students home.

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.629
The learning center tries to contact him,
but he ignores it.

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:41.130
At that moment he realizes that the police
already know his identity, so he decides to

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.599
have some fun with one of the schoolgirls.

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:46.300
He brings her home and sexually assaults her.

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:50.569
Just before he is about to devour her, he
hears someone calling his name.

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:53.709
He goes to check it out and finds a person
coming alone.

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:57.170
It is Soo-hyun, he manages to track him down.

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.860
Kyung-chul thinks that he is a policeman and
underestimates him because he comes unarmed

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:01.880
alone.

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.190
But unknown to him, he is no match for Soo-hyun,
a secret agent.

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:10.019
Soo-hyun easily takes him down and strangles
him until he is unconscious.

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:14.019
Soo-hyeon plans to do much more than simply
kill this psychopath.

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:18.959
He nearly beats him to death, before relenting
and shoving a GPS tracker down his throat,

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:24.050
allowing him to see Kyung-chul's location
in real-time and listen to his conversations.

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.270
After Kyung-chul regains consciousness, he
finds an envelope full of cash.

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:33.330
At first, Kyung-Chul remains oblivious that
Soo-hyeon does not want him dead, but instead

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.939
to suffer as much as humanly possible.

00:04:35.939 --> 00:04:40.080
He then goes for a walk and meets a taxi driver
that offers him a ride.

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.180
There is already a passenger inside.

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:47.289
Upon getting in, and correctly guesses that
the driver and passenger are two bandits intending

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:51.770
to rob and murder him, he strikes out preemptively
and kills them both.

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:56.029
Afterward, he finds the body of the real taxi
driver in the trunk.

00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:58.129
Kyung-chul throws out all three bodies.

00:04:58.129 --> 00:05:01.979
He then drives to a nearby town to treat his
injuries at a clinic.

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:06.580
Feeling sexually frustrated because he fails
to devour his last victim, he sexually assaults

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.039
a nurse there.

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:12.909
Soo-hyun once again intervenes and tortures
Kyung-chul, slicing his Achilles tendon.

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:16.849
Despite the warnings and pleas of his murdered
fiance’s sister and father to stop what

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:20.789
he’s doing, Soo-hyun continues his bloody
quest for vengeance.

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:25.199
Once again, Kyung-Chul regains consciousness
and finds himself stranded in the middle of

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:27.659
nowhere but still alive.

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:32.360
Kyung-chul visits the home of his friend,
Tae-joo, who is a murderer and cannibal.

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:36.969
After explaining his situation to Tae-joo,
Kyung-chul consequently deduces Soo-hyun's

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:41.910
identity after recalling Joo-yun's engagement
ring, which Soo-hyun had put on before attacking

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:43.409
him previously.

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:47.379
He plans to stay there for a while but Soo-hyun
is already on the move.

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:52.150
Just before Tae-joo is about to slaughter
his victim to restock his human flesh supply,

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:56.759
Soo-hyun comes and incapacitates Tae-joo along
with his girlfriend, and beats Kyung-chul

00:05:56.759 --> 00:05:57.999
senselessly.

00:05:57.999 --> 00:06:03.139
The next day, Tae-joo and his girlfriend are
arrested by the police and sent to the hospital.

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:06.809
The police start to realize that Soo-hyun
has gone rogue.

00:06:06.809 --> 00:06:10.069
Instead of bringing the suspect to the police,
he toys with him.

00:06:10.069 --> 00:06:14.550
Soo-hyun's trusted subordinate arranges for
Soo-hyun and Kyung-chul to evade the police

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:17.909
and receive treatment for their wounds at
a separate facility.

00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:23.349
The barely conscious Kyung-chul hears Soo-hyun
and the subordinate talking about the transmitter.

00:06:23.349 --> 00:06:27.509
Soo-hyun releases Kyung-chul again, but this
time he begins to catch on to Soo-hyun’s

00:06:27.509 --> 00:06:32.389
M O. He goes to a nearby pharmacy and slashes
the throat of a pharmacist while stealing

00:06:32.389 --> 00:06:35.930
laxatives which he plans to use to remove
the transmitter.

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:40.030
While doing this, he talks to Soo-hyun via
the transmitter and promises him that he will

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:41.870
show him the real pain.

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:45.899
So-hyun rushes to the pharmacy location but
he is already too late.

00:06:45.899 --> 00:06:49.699
The transmitter is still online and shows
Kyung-chul location.

00:06:49.699 --> 00:06:53.979
But it turns out that Kyung-chul already uses
the laxatives to remove the transmitter then

00:06:53.979 --> 00:06:57.419
plants it on a driver at a truck stop that
he viciously beats.

00:06:57.419 --> 00:07:00.210
Now, he can’t track him anymore.

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:05.229
Kyung chul contacts the police, telling them
that he plans on turning himself in, so Soo-hyun

00:07:05.229 --> 00:07:09.569
will be unable to touch him, but not before
he finishes some business.

00:07:09.569 --> 00:07:14.430
Feeling lost, So-hyun enters Tae-joo's hospital
room to question him and learns too late that

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:17.430
Kyung-chul is going after Joo-yeon’s father.

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:20.119
Angered, he breaks Tae-joo's jaw.

00:07:20.119 --> 00:07:24.520
Before Soo-hyun is able to catch on to
Kyung-chul’s plan and warn him, Kyung-chul

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:28.139
manages to get to him first and brutally attacks
him with a dumbbell.

00:07:28.139 --> 00:07:32.349
Joo-yeon's sister arrives at the house, not
aware of the situation.

00:07:32.349 --> 00:07:36.009
He then sexually assaults her and leaves her
for dead on the street.

00:07:36.009 --> 00:07:40.469
Shortly after, Kyung-chul attempts to avoid
Soo-hyun's revenge by surrendering to the

00:07:40.469 --> 00:07:41.499
police.

00:07:41.499 --> 00:07:46.629
However, Soo-hyun drives by and wheels off
with Kyung-chul right in front of the police's

00:07:46.629 --> 00:07:47.629
eyes.

00:07:47.629 --> 00:07:50.960
Kyung-Chul awakens to find himself tied up
inside his home.

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:55.229
After being tortured and stabbed, Kyung-Chul
still appears empowered, telling Soo-hyun

00:07:55.229 --> 00:07:56.650
that he’s lost.

00:07:56.650 --> 00:08:00.090
He can’t feel any pain, no fear, nothing.

00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:03.120
Soo-hyun places him under the makeshift guillotine.

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:07.240
Soo-hyun leaves Kyung-Chul, who now has a
rope tied from his mouth to the door, holding

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:09.419
the guillotine from beheading him.

00:08:09.419 --> 00:08:14.129
While Soo-hyun leaves, an older man and woman,
and a small child exit a taxi and approach

00:08:14.129 --> 00:08:15.289
the hideout.

00:08:15.289 --> 00:08:19.699
Though he mocks Soo-hyun, Kyung-chul begins
to panic when he learns that his son and elderly

00:08:19.699 --> 00:08:24.610
parents, whom he had abandoned some time ago,
have arrived and are trying to visit him.

00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:28.909
As his family opens the door, the guillotine
is dropped and Kyung-chul's head rolls to

00:08:28.909 --> 00:08:30.459
their feet.

00:08:30.459 --> 00:08:34.630
With Kyung-chul finally dead, Soo-hyun, who
was listening through the transmitter some

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:39.270
distance away, emotionally breaks down and
begins crying in the street as he slowly walks

00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:40.270
away.

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:45.060
He has fulfilled his promise to his fiance
and completed his bloody quest for vengeance.

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:47.740
But is it all worth the price he paid?
