00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.500
Today's movie is about people: the society

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.960
they are trapped in, the people around them,
and the hardships they face.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.360
Just 2 years after the LA riots of 1992, the
tension and anger between ethnic groups is

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:14.260
still high.

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:18.400
Our story first follows the life of young
Eva Benitez: a latina growing up in Long Beach

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.939
California, with all the hopes and dreams
of any American.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.140
But hers is the hard knocks life: her brother
was shot

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.760
her father arrested when she was a child

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.720
and Eva herself joined
a Latino gang.

00:00:33.853 --> 00:00:37.600
1994, Long Beach, California is a hard place
to live and harder place to teach.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.410
A lesson Erin Gruwell is gonnna learn teaching
English for at-risk students at Woodrow Wilson

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:43.410
High School.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.540
A school once praised and highly integrated,
now filled with tension between people.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.129
Erin is a woman with principles, a real champion
of civil rights, feeling called to educate

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:53.560
youth at risk.

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.380
Its difficult to even talk with them when
they split into their little groups and don’t

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.760
bother with the class.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.220
But first things first, she takes attendance to get get to know the students:

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.120
Brandy Ross, Gloria Munez, Andre Bryant

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:11.820
Ben Daniels, Sindee Ngyugen, Jamal Hill, Eva Benitez, and things go downhill: “Eva”

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.000
is quick to correct her name pronunciation
and leaves

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.100
when Jamal starts whining about

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.320
the class he almost comes to blows with Andre
after being called a dummy.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.400
No one swings at first but Erin’s first day
is not going well.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.220
During her break, she meets with Brian Gelford
and Margaret Campbell.

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:30.270
Gelford is welcoming though he doesn’t really
care much for the problem students because

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.220
they’ll quit (like they do) and Erin will
be free to teach a different class.

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.570
Once they quit
Cut to Eva riding bus, thinking about her

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.700
life: she’s on probation, her probation
officer has forced her to go to school, and Eva

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.980
points out how prison and school are like
each other: the students gather up into tribes

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.700
(Latinos, Blacks, Asians) and get into battles
with each other.

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.680
Ready to fight at a moment’s notice, Eva notes this as she watches

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.990
a black student in an orange hoodie get a bit
too close to the latinos.

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.360
The next day, Erin tries to teach and fails
at getting their attention.

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.880
So, Eva sneaks out to let in some of her buddies.

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.980
When back in class, Jamal makes a ruckus by taking
Gloria’s bag and before Erin can do anything.

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:06.980
Bam!

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:08.120
Gunshots!

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:09.750
It’s going down, just like Eva said.

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.950
People are running in the halls, an alarm
is going off, it’s like a prison riot, with

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.310
the Latinos and the ‘ghetto-ers’ (Eva’s
words not mine) in particular going at it.

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.750
Reality sinks in for Erin who back at home,
locks her pearls away, when we meet Erin’s

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.670
husband, Scott, before they’re off to have
dinner with Erin’s dad, though not before

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.489
Erin makes Scott promise to not tell her dad
about what happened that day.

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:33.099
Her dad, Steve, isn’t too thrilled with
her teaching job, and is dismissive of the

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:37.249
students at Woodrow, but after Scott jumps
to her defense, Steve accepts it.

00:02:37.249 --> 00:02:40.160
It’s night time and Eva and Sindee got plans
for the night.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.220
Eva with her group, and Sindee with her crew,
both go to the same convenience store.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.299
All is going well until Eva’s crew spots
the same student in an orange hoodie, who

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:52.120
frustrated at losing an arcade game, demands
a refund from the store owner.

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.940
As Grant, the man in the orange hoodie,  storms out of the store,

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.800
Eva's boyfriend, Paco has the perfect opportunity and

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.000
attempts a drive-by shooting to kill Grant, he misses
accidentally killing Sindy's boyfriend while

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.600
Grant runs away. *ding* (Grant gets caught, and wrongly accused of the shooting.)

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:12.060
As a witness, Eva must testify at court; but
blood protects blood so she protects "her

00:03:12.061 --> 00:03:13.849
own people" in her testimony.

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:17.930
The school teachers have a meeting about the
shooting: bringing to Erin’s attention of

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.720
Eva’s role as sole witness in the shooting.

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.599
In class, Gruwell intercepts a racist drawing
by one of her high school students and uses

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:30.310
it to teach them about the Holocaust, comparing
Adolf Hitler and the Third Reich to a gang.

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.460
A confrontation happens: students vs teacher, or in a more personal way of seeing it

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:36.180
the streets vs. the suburb girl

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.760
Eva blasts out, "You don't know nothing."

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.800
Why should I listen to you?

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:42.269
Why are you are pretending to care?

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:45.139
Don’t you talk to me like you understand
because you do not!

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:48.290
After she cools down Tito brings up a question
about what the Holocaust is.

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.639
Erin is eager to educate her students, so
she requests materials for the class though

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:56.480
Margaret is quick to shoot down any hopes
for giving them resources.

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.669
Since Margaret isn’t any help, in fact is
against helping, Erin goes to Brian for help,

00:04:00.669 --> 00:04:04.560
who bites back with sarcasm: these kids don’t
care about learning, they’re the ones making

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.180
life dangerous, and the teachers have it way
harder than any of the students.

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:13.290
She walks out on him but has an idea: Back
in class, she introduces The Line Game!

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.950
She asks a yes/no question, you step up to
the line if yes, stay away if no.

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:21.599
At first it’s small things: What movies
you watched, what you music you listen to.

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:22.949
It's all easy going

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:26.160
But then it gets serious: Do you live in the ghetto?

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.139
Do know someone in prison or in juvie?

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:29.180
Ever been in Juvie?

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.139
Does anyone know any dealers?

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:32.600
Does anyone know any gangsters?

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.610
Has anyone lost a friend to gang violence?

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.200
More than 1 friend?

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.540
More than 3?

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:39.740
More than 4?

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.680
With their final answer, she asks them to Pay their respects.

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.690
It’s eye-opening for everyone and the class
ends with Erin giving them journals to write

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:47.180
in.

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.540
If they want to, they can leave it in a closet at the end of class

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:51.020
so that Erin can read them.

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.240
and on the night of the parent-teacher conference
she decides to take a look at the diaries:

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:00.540
What she finds in them are experiences like
abuse, seeing friends die, parents fighting

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:05.060
and so on, these kids took this as a chance
to just get everything off their chest.

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:09.280
Erin organizes the field trip to the Museum
of Tolerance, where they learn about the Holocaust

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.940
and afterwards they meet with real Holocaust
survivors at the Marriot.

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:14.560
The experience leaves everyone changed for
better.

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.300
In the first sophomore class of the year

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:22.199
Erin makes her class do a "Toast for Change",
allowing everyone to open up about their struggles

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:26.449
and what they wish to change about themselves:
Gloria starts off by saying she could have

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:30.039
been a pregnant in high school like her mom,
Marcus wishes to graduate even though his

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:34.111
mom has kicked him out of the house and Alejandro
recounts an entry from his diary about the

00:05:34.111 --> 00:05:38.400
his miserable life that even though his mom
is dead, his father is without a job, and

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.120
he could easily become homeless; even then
he is supported by friends, and his teacher

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.140
who have all together given him hope.

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:48.820
Whether on the bus, on a bench, at school
or at home, the class reads the diary of Anne

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.470
Frank, transfixed on the experiences of the
girl.

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:55.940
Eva, in particular, connects deeply with Anne
Frank, becoming totally gripped by story but

00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:00.750
ultimately feels betrayed by Erin: the ‘hero’
dies and the bad guys win, what the hell does

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:02.419
that say for Eva or anyone else?

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:04.319
That they’ll die and fail to be anything?

00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:08.220
Marcus is quick to defend Erin and Anne Frank:
Anne isn’t dead, her story lives on and

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:10.830
is proof that they too can survive.

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:15.180
Marcus did some research on Anne Frank which
gives Erin an idea: try to get Miep Gies,

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:18.580
the woman who helped protect Anne Frank and
her family, to come to the school!

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:22.190
The class are excited and are so keen on the
idea that they make a group fund to pay for

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:24.460
Miep Gies’s ticket by holding a fair and
a concert.

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:25.720
Much to Margaret’s frustration,

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:30.120
In the library, Miep Gies tells her experience
when she helped Anne Frank, her family, and

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:34.820
the Van Pels hide from the Nazis; when Marcus
tells her that She is his hero, she rebuffs

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:40.509
him, she was just doing the right thing, anyone
especially the students can be and are heroes

00:06:40.509 --> 00:06:44.960
and that they "within their own small ways,
can turn on a small light in a dark room."

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:48.380
These two events inspire Eva to break free
of the demands of her father

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:50.980
"to always protect her own" rather than tell the truth.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.140
This also gives Marcus the courage to go back
to his mom who, thankfully, takes him back.

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:58.100
At Grant's trial, Eva shocks the courtroom

00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:59.340
"Paco did it."

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:01.780
by revealing that Paco actually killed Sindy's

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:04.660
boyfriend in the store; Grant is spared of
being convicted

00:07:04.669 --> 00:07:07.490
and Eva is attacked and
threatened but ultimately spared by members

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:10.920
of her gang and ends up going to live with
her aunt in order to keep herself safe.

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:12.720
But the joy ends that night

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:15.060
when Erin’s husband, Scott, divorces
her.

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:18.800
In the final days of the sophomore class,
the class realize that

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.160
Erin will not be teaching the junior's class.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:21.640
But the students are taken aback.

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:24.120
That’s a dumb rule, she totally can teach
them!

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:28.060
Ben suggests that Erin fights for her right teach juniors and seniors

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:29.740
which the rest of the class agree with.

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:34.720
So the decision is put forward to the board, though Brian and Margaret are very against his

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:37.580
Meanwhile, Erin asks her students to write
their diaries in book form.

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:41.220
She compiles the entries and names it The
Freedom Writers Diary.

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:43.940
In tribute to the 'Freedom Riders", a group of civil activists.

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:48.780
Erin fights this decision, eventually convincing
the superintendent to permit her to teach

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:51.420
her kids' junior and senior year, much to
their joy.

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:53.900
The film ends with a note that Erin successfully

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:57.137
prepared numerous high school students to graduate high school and attend college.

00:07:57.137 --> 00:07:59.469
For many, they were the first in their families to do so.

00:07:59.469 --> 00:08:02.420
