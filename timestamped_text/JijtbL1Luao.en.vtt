00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:01.500
Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.580
Today, I'm going to explain a Horror film
called "Tusk."

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:06.009
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:07.689
Watch out and take care.

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:12.110
Wallace Bryton has been scouring the internet
for humiliating videos to show it to his friend,

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.420
Teddy, on their popular podcast, the Not-See
party.

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.840
One day, a fan sends him a video of a kid
accidentally chopping his leg off with a katana.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.539
The video has since gone viral, and the boy
has been dubbed as the "Kill Bill Kid."

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:26.730
As they watch the video during their show,
Teddy says he's starting to feel bad for the

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:27.730
boy.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.880
Wallace, however, feels no sympathy, pointing
out that he has become famous with 30 million

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:32.880
hits on the internet.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.890
Later on, they announce that Wallace will
travel to Manitoba, Canada, to interview the

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.190
Kill Bill Kid for their next episode.

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.100
Before signing off, Wallace takes cheap potshots
at the kid, saying he hopes that the boy doesn't

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.310
cry too much during the interview.

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:49.430
When he arrives at the boy's house, he's puzzled
when he sees a funeral flower at the doorstep.

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.620
He then hears someone crying, so he walks
to the yard and discovers that they're holding

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.540
a funeral for the Kill Bill Kid.

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.510
He soon learns that the boy had killed himself
with his own sword.

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.190
While having a drink at Bar H, Wallace calls
Teddy, expressing his frustration that the

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.030
boy didn't wait for two more days for the
interview.

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.220
Wallace tells Teddy that he couldn't come
back home without any material for their show,

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.560
so he decides to find someone else to interview.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.920
In the bathroom, he finds a handbill from
a man offering free lodging in his woodland

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.960
home to anyone interested in performing household
chores for him.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.070
The man, Howard, says that he can no longer
do the simple tasks because he's confined

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.470
to the wheelchair.

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.670
Wallace's interest is roused by Howard's promise
to share stories about his adventures in the

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.900
ocean when he was younger, so he takes the
invitation.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.840
During a stop at a convenience store, Wallace
calls Howard looking for his address.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.920
Howard instructs him to go to Bifrost, so
Wallace asks the clerks how far it is from

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:35.920
the store.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.940
The two girls tell him that he's still quite
far, noting that it's about two hours away.

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.320
Upon his arrival, Wallace and Howard immediately
get acquainted.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.930
After offering Wallace some tea, Howard asks
Wallace about his purpose since he's not interested

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.610
in staying at the house.

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.220
Wallace explains that he came to hear about
his adventures so he could talk about them

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:52.820
on his podcast.

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.340
The two start drinking, and Howard starts
narrating his memorable adventures, starting

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.920
with meeting Ernest Hemingway in Normandy
on D-Day.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.400
Hemingway had been prohibited from joining
the raid, so he stayed on the boat.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.630
Hemingway was disappointed that he doesn't
get to engage in combat, so he goes to the

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:06.840
galley to find alcohol.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.129
Howard, who worked as a potato peeler at the
time, offers him a bottle of Weiser.

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:14.379
After hearing about the casualties from the
battle, Hemingway utters his famous quote,

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:16.239
"Only do sober what you do drunk.

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:18.309
It will teach you to keep your mouth shut."

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:21.500
Howard shows him the bottle he offered to
Hemingway, saying it's just an old bottle,

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.459
but it becomes a powerful talisman when combined
with the story.

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:28.319
Soon, a phallic-shaped artifact on the wall
catches Wallace's eye.

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:30.680
Howard says that it is a baculum from a walrus.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.750
He explains that it's a bone found in the
reproductive organ of placental mammals to

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.480
aid them during intercourse.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.599
Howard contends that it's only proper to admire
the walrus because it's one of the noblest

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:40.079
creatures on the planet.

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:43.489
When Wallace asks how Howard came across the
artifact, Howard reveals that he once had

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:46.389
a profound encounter with a walrus when he
was lost at sea.

00:02:46.389 --> 00:02:50.380
He tells Wallace that the shipwreck happened
on the southern coast of Siberia in 1959 when

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.699
they were searching for the Great White Shark.

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:55.809
They never found the shark because their ship
collided with an iceberg.

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:58.799
After the boat sank, Howard swam alone in
the dark, terrified.

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:02.849
Soon, he wakes up on a small island and learns
that a walrus had saved him.

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:06.980
Howard recalls that even with its large tusks,
the animal as gentle as a cow.

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.689
Howard says he named it "Mr. Tusk," after
the only authority figure he trusted, a janitor

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:12.319
named Mr. Tuskegee.

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:15.329
He says he's never had such a fulfilling friendship
with anyone.

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:19.030
As Howard continues to describe his experience
with the walrus, Wallace starts feeling drowsy

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.650
and falls to the floor.

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.889
Howard tells Wallace he will be alright and
calls him Mr. Tusk.

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:28.419
Before Wallace went to Canada, his girlfriend,
Ally, tried to stop him because she doesn't

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:31.099
want to make fun of the Kill Bill Kid in his
own home.

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:34.609
Wallace points out that the teenager reached
out to him after turning down Oprah Winfrey.

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:38.150
He claims that he doesn't intend to make fun
of the boy, and he's only doing it for his

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:39.150
show.

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.010
Ally notes that the Wallace she fell in love
with would never exploit a kid.

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.709
Wallace, however, stresses that his old self
couldn't pay his bills because he was unsuccessful

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:46.909
as a comedian.

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:49.959
He says he prefers his new persona because
he could make a lot of money from the ads

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:52.439
from his podcast and his merchandise.

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:55.519
Ally urges him to take her to Canada with
him, but Wallace argues that Teddy would get

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:56.829
weird and jealous.

00:03:56.829 --> 00:03:59.880
Furthermore, Wallace worries that he wouldn't
be as funny if she's with him because he would

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.379
be distracted.

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:04.799
As Wallace prepares to make love, Ally tells
him that she misses the old Wallace because

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:06.479
he was so sweet and soft.

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:10.150
Ally teases Wallace, saying he used to cry
over Winnie the Pooh.

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.559
Back at Howard's home, Wallace wakes up in
a wheelchair.

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:16.350
Howard, who's polishing a tusk across the
room, says he got scared when he saw Wallace

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:17.970
collapse the previous night.

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:22.139
He tells Wallace that he passed out because
he was bit by a spider called the brown recluse.

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:25.789
Still dazed, Wallace asks him for his phone,
but Howard tells him that a certain Dr. Mosier

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:27.849
broke it while treating Wallace.

00:04:27.849 --> 00:04:31.360
When Wallace notices that he can't feel his
legs, Howard informs him that it's the spinal

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.690
injection because the spider had filled him
with so much poison that his ankle became

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:35.740
swollen.

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.720
Howard then mentions that Dr. Mosier had to
amputate his leg to prevent the venom from

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.440
traveling to his heart.

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.340
When he removes the blanket on his thigh,
he's shocked to see that his legs have been

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:44.860
cut off at the knee.

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.080
Wallace demands to know why he wasn't brought
to a hospital, so Howard tells him the doctor

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:52.009
felt it's best to recuperate at the house
because hospitals are full of diseases.

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:55.120
Wallace can't make sense of the situation,
so he asks to talk to the doctor.

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.840
Howard, however, claims that the doctor is
making his rounds.

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.259
Howard begins to narrate his experiences again,
but Wallace gets frustrated and tells him

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:04.880
that he's no longer interested in his stories.

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.280
Wallace tries to get up but sees he’s been
tied up.

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.050
Howard laughs at him as he explains that he
put the belt to keep him from falling from

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:11.090
the chair.

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:14.780
When Wallace asks to borrow a phone, Howard
says that the doctor removed all the communication

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:18.379
devices from the house so Wallace wouldn't
be disturbed while he recovers.

00:05:18.379 --> 00:05:21.360
Before leaving the room, Howard holds back
his laughter as he tells Wallace that he's

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:22.620
sorry about his predicament.

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:27.310
That night, Howard serves dinner, but Wallace
couldn't eat because he can't move his arms.

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:30.500
Howard informs him that he's still incapacitated
because he's been injected with morphine for

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:31.770
his leg pain.

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:34.969
When Wallace starts to suspect that there
was no spider, Howard mocks him by singing

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:36.680
Itsy-bitsy spider.

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.600
Wallace yells at him, asking him to let him
out but is shocked to see Howard getting up

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.060
from his wheelchair.

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:44.380
Howard walks toward him and slaps him in the
face as he calls for help.

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:48.379
When Howard gets back to his chair, he reveals
that he's been creating a walrus suit.

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:51.610
Wallace starts to feel disheartened as he
listens to Howard explaining his bizarre fixation

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:53.020
with walruses.

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:56.310
Howard says that when Wallace wears the suit,
he must act like a walrus and stop using his

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:57.710
human voice.

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:59.729
Wallace starts begging Howard to let him go.

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:03.060
When Wallace asks him about his motive, Howard
tells him that he intends to find out if a

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:04.969
man is really a walrus at heart.

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:08.810
When Wallace yells for help again, Howard
mocks him by screaming along with him.

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:12.330
Meanwhile, Ally pours her heart out to another
man because she has started to resent Wallace

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:13.719
for cheating on her.

00:06:13.719 --> 00:06:16.860
She stresses that she also hates herself for
putting her life on hold for him.

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:19.759
Ally cherishes the moments he spends with
the man because he restores her every time

00:06:19.759 --> 00:06:21.400
Wallace destroys her.

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:24.790
During the podcast episode before Wallace's
trip to Canada, Teddy disclosed that he would

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:28.099
be taking Ally to the Getty because Wallace
is disinterested in art.

00:06:28.099 --> 00:06:31.659
When they sign off, Teddy mentions that Ally
wants to go with him to Canada.

00:06:31.659 --> 00:06:34.669
But Wallace stresses that he doesn't want
Ally around when he interviews the Kill Bill

00:06:34.669 --> 00:06:37.270
Kid because he can't be himself if she's there.

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:40.990
Wallace is irritated with Ally at times because
she constantly berates him for doing "mean

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:41.990
comedy."

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:44.669
Wallace then confesses that he wants to be
with other women even though he finds Ally

00:06:44.669 --> 00:06:45.669
hot.

00:06:45.669 --> 00:06:48.419
He tells Teddy that he's going over to Ally's
place to have intercourse with her before

00:06:48.419 --> 00:06:49.419
his trip.

00:06:49.419 --> 00:06:53.930
Back in Howard's house, Wallace hears his
phone ringing, so he tries to follow the sound.

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:56.240
As he reaches the phone, the ringing stops.

00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:00.469
He sees it’s a missed call from Ally. Wallace
calls her back, but she wouldn't answer, so

00:07:00.469 --> 00:07:01.469
he leaves a message.

00:07:01.469 --> 00:07:05.379
He whispers into the phone, asking Ally for
help, saying a man had abducted him and wants

00:07:05.379 --> 00:07:07.200
to turn him into an animal.

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:10.110
Wallace tells her that he's really scared
that he'll never see her again and apologizes

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:11.810
for the way he treated her.

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:15.699
Meanwhile, Teddy brushes his teeth and gets
ready to spend the night with Ally. Wallace

00:07:15.699 --> 00:07:18.539
leaves Teddy a voice message to ask him for
help as well.

00:07:18.539 --> 00:07:22.090
As Wallace gives Teddy details about his situation,
Howard approaches him from behind and hits

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:23.400
him in the head.

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:26.569
Howard tells Wallace that his life as a human
is over, and he'll have to become a walrus

00:07:26.569 --> 00:07:27.949
if he wants to survive.

00:07:27.949 --> 00:07:31.849
In the morning, Ally hears the voice message
on her phone while she brushes her teeth.

00:07:31.849 --> 00:07:35.499
After learning that Wallace is in trouble,
she wakes Ted up and lets him hear the message.

00:07:35.499 --> 00:07:39.499
When Ally looks at Teddy's phone, she learns
that Wallace left a message for him as well.

00:07:39.499 --> 00:07:42.949
She returns Wallace's call, but he couldn't
answer because Howard is performing an operation

00:07:42.949 --> 00:07:44.259
on him.

00:07:44.259 --> 00:07:46.879
Howard tells him that it's good to know that
someone cares for him, recalling that the

00:07:46.879 --> 00:07:49.680
only one that ever showed him any affection
was Mr. Tusk.

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:52.610
He tells Wallace that he had been exploited
when he was a young boy.

00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:55.740
He narrates that he was placed at an orphanage
after his mother and father were killed by

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:57.400
muggers in Montreal.

00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:01.270
Not long after, the children at the orphanages
were sent to an insane asylum because a corrupt

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:05.219
politician shut down the orphanages and reclassified
them as mental health institutions to get

00:08:05.219 --> 00:08:06.810
funding from the government.

00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:09.780
During his five years at the asylum, he was
beaten and tortured.

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:13.900
He says that people at the asylum, including
priests, politicians, and nuns, have forced

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:15.240
themselves on him.

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:19.490
When he was 15, he managed to escape from
Canada and made his way to the U.S.

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:23.099
When Howard finishes the operation on Wallace,
his arms have been sewed to his torso, and

00:08:23.099 --> 00:08:24.789
his other leg has also been cut off.

00:08:24.789 --> 00:08:28.720
Meanwhile, Ally and Teddy alert the authorities
about Wallace's abduction as they drive to

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:29.720
Manitoba.

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:34.289
In an underground room, Howard finishes fitting
the walrus costume onto Wallace's body.

00:08:34.289 --> 00:08:36.950
Howard begins reciting poetry as Wallace screeches
at him.

00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:40.940
Howard, speaking to Wallace as if he's Mr.
Tusk, says he misses the time they spent together

00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:42.690
when he was shipwrecked at Ponder Rock.

00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:46.260
Howard recites another poem expressing his
regret of leaving Mr. Tusk behind to be with

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:47.500
humans again.

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:50.860
He feels like he made a mistake going back,
citing the atrocities humans commit against

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:52.230
each other.

00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:55.970
Ally and Teddy track down Wallace by showing
his picture at car rental companies.

00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:59.050
When they get to the police station, they
let a detective hear Wallace's last message

00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:00.090
to them.

00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:03.120
The detective asks them if they're sure Wallace
isn't pulling a prank, pointing out that they

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:05.410
usually clown around in their podcasts.

00:09:05.410 --> 00:09:08.740
Teddy assures the cop that Wallace wouldn't
go too far with his jokes.

00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:12.269
The detective is baffled by the part of Wallace's
message where he says Howard had cut off his

00:09:12.269 --> 00:09:13.269
leg.

00:09:13.269 --> 00:09:16.230
He then recalls that a former detective from
Quebec had recently asked him if they've found

00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:18.339
legless bodies around their jurisdiction.

00:09:18.339 --> 00:09:22.209
The detective gives them the number of the
former cop, Guy Lapointe, who had been hunting

00:09:22.209 --> 00:09:24.410
for a serial killer in Canada.

00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:28.130
Back at the house, Howard forces Wallace to
learn to swim as a walrus by forcibly pulling

00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:30.740
him into the water with a remote-controlled
chain.

00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:33.899
Wallace manages to stay up in the water, but
he couldn't stay afloat for long.

00:09:33.899 --> 00:09:37.250
At the bottom of the pool, Wallace is struck
with terror when he discovers a human corpse

00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:38.440
in a walrus costume.

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:42.420
In Manitoba, Ally and Teddy meet up with Guy,
who has been hunting for Howard Howe for the

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:43.649
last decade.

00:09:43.649 --> 00:09:47.170
He discloses that he's sacrificed several
marriages and even his sanity just to find

00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:48.170
Howard.

00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:51.089
He hasn't been sleeping well because of his
obsession, but when Ally and Teddy contacted

00:09:51.089 --> 00:09:55.300
him, he finally slept like a baby because
he now knows that he's close to catching Howard.

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:58.310
Guy reveals that Howard has already killed
twenty-three people, and the number could

00:09:58.310 --> 00:10:01.000
go up to twenty-four if they don't find Wallace
soon.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
Guy says that Howard's M.O. has remained the
same over the years.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.110
The authorities usually find the pieces of
the skinned body a month after the victim's

00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:08.140
disappearance.

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:11.639
The legs are always removed at the knees,
and arms are sewed to the body.

00:10:11.639 --> 00:10:15.400
The victim's mouth and teeth are always mutilated,
with their tongues ripped out.

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:18.630
Guy explains that he strongly believes that
he had met Howard a few years back while he

00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:21.080
was looking for a missing hockey player in
Quebec.

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:23.690
During the search, he came across a secluded
cabin.

00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:27.279
When Guy approached the house, a man named
Bartholomew Mosier asks him to kill a spider

00:10:27.279 --> 00:10:28.279
in his bathroom.

00:10:28.279 --> 00:10:31.699
Bartholomew, who speaks with a goofy voice,
tells Guy that he called the police to deal

00:10:31.699 --> 00:10:32.960
with the spider.

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:36.590
Guy, however, says the police did not send
him, but he's looking for a hockey player

00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:38.060
named Gregory Gumtree.

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:42.090
Before his disappearance, Gregory had seen
an advertisement offering him a place to stay.

00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:45.560
Guy asks the man if he's seen anything suspicious
on Monday night, but he tells him that he

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:48.600
was at the rink running errands for a hockey
team called the Little Mites.

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:51.839
The man tells Guy that they usually go to
a restaurant on Mondays.

00:10:51.839 --> 00:10:55.650
Before Guy leaves, Bartholomew asks him again
if he's sure he's not there to kill the spider.

00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:58.399
Guy says he's not paid enough to deal with
savage animals.

00:10:58.399 --> 00:11:02.070
Bartholomew responds by saying he thinks that
the real savages are humans.

00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:05.339
Guy tells them that he has since discovered
that there's no record of a man named Bartholomew

00:11:05.339 --> 00:11:07.910
Mosier, and there's no team called the Little
Mites.

00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:11.040
He surmises that Gregory was probably at the
house when he paid a visit.

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:15.480
A month later, the authorities find Gregory's
body clogging up a sewer pipe outside Gatineau.

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:18.470
By that time, Bartholomew had already disappeared.

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:21.540
Guy had been fired from the force because
he challenged the theory that meat hooks caused

00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:23.510
the mutilation in the victims' mouths.

00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:26.709
He points out that Gumtree also had holes
in the roof of his mouth, and the authorities

00:11:26.709 --> 00:11:29.850
found a tiny piece of his own tibia bone inside
one hole.

00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:32.910
When Guy asked Gumtree's mother what she thinks
happened to her son, the mother says that

00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:34.950
the killer is making a monster.

00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:38.589
Back at the house, Howard asks Wallace why
he's still mourning the loss of his humanity.

00:11:38.589 --> 00:11:42.009
He explains that during his travels, he only
found that humans are cruel.

00:11:42.009 --> 00:11:45.690
He tells Wallace that he's already tired from
being battered by life and by fate.

00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:48.750
Howard senses that Wallace must be hungry,
so he throws him a mackerel and tells him

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:50.000
to eat up.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.069
Howard leaves the pool area to watch Wallace
eat the fish through the window.

00:11:53.069 --> 00:11:56.420
When Wallace finally takes a bite, Howard
is satisfied that Wallace seems to be adapting

00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:59.790
to his life as a walrus, so he leaves him
alone.

00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:03.089
Before leaving to search for Wallace, Guy
asks Ally about his driving habits, so Ally

00:12:03.089 --> 00:12:06.660
tells him that Wallace likes buying large
drinks from convenience stores.

00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:10.839
When they show Wallace's photo to a store
clerk, the woman recognizes him as Mr. Mustache.

00:12:10.839 --> 00:12:14.350
Guy soon learns that Wallace had written the
address of his destination on a pad.

00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:17.550
Guy asks the store clerk for the pad Wallace
used and shades it with a pencil to see what

00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:19.389
was written on the previous page.

00:12:19.389 --> 00:12:22.970
Meanwhile, Howard enters the water with Wallace
to help him swim.

00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:26.009
Howard reveals to Wallace that he had killed
Mr. Tusk at Ponder Rock when he ran out of

00:12:26.009 --> 00:12:27.009
food.

00:12:27.009 --> 00:12:30.290
When he was rescued, he saw the animal's blood
on his hand and immediately regretted what

00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:31.410
he has done.

00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:34.720
He tells Wallace that Mr. Tusk wasn't prepared
for the fight the last time.

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:37.329
He assures him that it would be different
this time because he's already shown him how

00:12:37.329 --> 00:12:39.250
cruel man can be.

00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:42.819
When Guy finds Wallace's rented car in a swamp,
he hands Ally and Teddy guns to prepare them

00:12:42.819 --> 00:12:46.269
for an encounter with Howard, noting that
he is very dangerous.

00:12:46.269 --> 00:12:49.850
Back at the subterranean room, Howard dons
a walrus suit, as he discloses that he had

00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:52.139
killed Mr. Tusk an hour before his rescue.

00:12:52.139 --> 00:12:55.130
He says that he is now giving the walrus a
fighting chance to commemorate the day he

00:12:55.130 --> 00:12:56.690
killed the animal.

00:12:56.690 --> 00:12:59.019
Wallace keeps screaming as he fights against
Howard.

00:12:59.019 --> 00:13:03.009
Outside, Ally hears Wallace's screams, so
they rush toward the house.

00:13:03.009 --> 00:13:06.570
As they continue to fight, Howard tells Wallace
that he survived longer than the others, noting

00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:08.880
that his survival instincts have kicked in.

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:12.310
Howard then takes the walrus suit off saying
his instincts have also been triggered.

00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:16.070
When Howard aims to hit Wallace with the baculum,
Wallace buries his tusk on Howard's foot,

00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:17.970
causing him to drop to the ground.

00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:21.259
Wallace continues to attack by repeatedly
stabbing Howard with his tusks.

00:13:21.259 --> 00:13:24.870
As Howard's life fades, he tells Wallace that
he is indeed Mr. Tusk.

00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:29.140
When Teddy and Ally finally enter the room,
Ally is grieved to see his appearance.

00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:31.700
Wallace bellows at them repeatedly as they
look at him with pity.

00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:35.319
Guy points a shotgun at Wallace, pondering
if he should put an end to his misery, but

00:13:35.319 --> 00:13:36.319
Ally stops him.

00:13:36.319 --> 00:13:39.980
A year later, Ally and Teddy go to a zoo to
pay Wallace a visit.

00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:43.260
Ally calls out to Wallace, but he wouldn't
come out, so Teddy suggests throwing him a

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:44.420
mackerel.

00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:46.980
After throwing the fish to the pen, Wallace
comes out to take a bite.

00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:49.779
Teddy tells Wallace that he doesn't have to
hide from them.

00:13:49.779 --> 00:13:53.110
When Wallace sees Ally's tears, he recalls
when she was chiding him because he no longer

00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:55.200
cries when he watches Winnie the Pooh.

00:13:55.200 --> 00:14:00.170
She narrates that when his grandmother died,
she told his grandfather not to shed tears.

00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:02.519
Her grandfather, however, asserts that it's
good to cry because it separates the people

00:14:02.519 --> 00:14:03.970
from animals.

00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:06.770
Before leaving the zoo, Ally tells Wallace
that she loves him.

00:14:06.770 --> 00:14:18.420
Tears start to flow from Wallace's eyes as
he goes back to his rock shelter.
