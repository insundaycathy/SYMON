00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.160
Story Recapped here. Today, I'm&nbsp;
going to explain a drama, fantasy,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.400
and mystery film called "The Illusionist."&nbsp;
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.440
A young Eisenheim sits all dusty under&nbsp;
a table. He walks through the fields&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.520
and meets a traveling magician. The magician&nbsp;
immediately enchants him with his parlor tricks,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:16.960
and Eisenheim's eyes sparkle in awe.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.840
In his room, Eisenheim starts practicing&nbsp;
magic. The townsfolk judges him for being&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.280
different. A girl from royalty named Sophie is on&nbsp;
horseback the day she lays her eyes on Eisenheim.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.160
She admires him not for his&nbsp;
magic but for the person he is.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.720
They sit in the living room, and her caretakers&nbsp;
barge in, interrupting the moment they're having.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.720
They're forbidden to interact with&nbsp;
one another because he is a peasant,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.800
and she is from royal blood. However, the&nbsp;
distance makes the star-crossed lovers' hearts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.040
grow fonder. At a secluded cave, they make a&nbsp;
promise to run away together and disappear.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.640
One day, Eisenheim gives Sophie a&nbsp;
pendant in the shape of a heart.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.920
Eisenheim meets Sophie at the hidden cave one&nbsp;
night. They hide within the shadows as guards&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.640
comes looking for her. Sophie asks him to&nbsp;
make them disappear. He tries to, but magic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.000
fails them. They get separated that&nbsp;
night, never to see each other again.

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:10.240
15 years later. Eisenheim, the now renowned&nbsp;
magician, performs in Vienna. He borrows a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.560
handkerchief from a woman. He puts it in a box&nbsp;
and returns it. He starts to handle an orange&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.200
expertly while explaining the concept of time.&nbsp;
He cuts it, removes its seed, and plants it in a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.080
pot. The seed starts to grow into a fruit-bearing&nbsp;
tree before everyone's eyes. The handkerchief from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.080
before appears on stage while two butterflies&nbsp;
carry it. The crowd showers him with applause&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:34.160
and standing ovations. Inspector Uhl is seen among&nbsp;
the audience, thoroughly enjoying the performance.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.120
On the streets, unfortunate children approach&nbsp;
him. He gave them money using tricks and goes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:44.080
on his way. He enters a cafe and talks to&nbsp;
his manager, Josef, about their earnings.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.920
Inspector Uhl enters the theatre and examines&nbsp;
the stage, hoping to find out the tricks behind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.320
Eisenheim's magic. Eisenheim sees him touching&nbsp;
his equipment and shouts for him to stop.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.080
Uhl informs them that the crown prince will&nbsp;
be watching his performance later that night.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.200
He analyzes Eisenheim's tricks and says&nbsp;
his secrets are safe in the hands of a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.560
fellow magician. Eisenheim entertains&nbsp;
Uhl and even teaches him a trick.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.960
Leopold, the crown prince, enters the theatre,&nbsp;
and the performance begins. Eisenheim asks the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.920
audience what it means to die. He asks for a&nbsp;
volunteer, but the crowd is reluctant. Leopold&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.160
stands up and points to a woman beside him. She&nbsp;
steps onto the stage, and Eisenheim hears someone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.240
call the woman Duchess von Teschen. The title that&nbsp;
Sophie carried. Shock is evident in Eisenheim’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:27.920
eyes as he realizes that this woman is the girl he&nbsp;
loves. He asks if she knows him. She assures him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.320
that they haven't met before. His assistant helps&nbsp;
her wear a robe, and they gaze at each other.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.320
He positions her, wears the hood over her&nbsp;
head, and instructs her to do odd things.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.400
She bows to the mirror, but the image in the&nbsp;
mirror doesn’t bow back. Another person wearing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.880
a robe appears in the mirror and attacks the woman&nbsp;
with a blade. Eisenheim directs a cloud of smoke;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.640
it passes through Sophie, making her&nbsp;
briefly faint. The show ends with applause.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.800
Eisenheim enters the room where the crown prince&nbsp;
and Sophie stay in. They greet one another,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.960
and Leopold asks if he has supernatural powers.&nbsp;
He then tries to deduce the tricks behind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.480
the performance earlier, but Eisenheim&nbsp;
neither says he's mistaken or correct.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.600
He invites him to perform for them&nbsp;
at his mansion. As they leave,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.480
Eisenheim says something that only Sophie will&nbsp;
recognize. She looks back at him, shocked.

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.520
Josef and Eisenheim gossip&nbsp;
about Sophie marrying Leopold.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.360
Josef adds on by saying Sophie's unlucky because&nbsp;
Leopold allegedly hurts women he’s been with.

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.280
Eisenheim receives a letter the&nbsp;
next day. He rides his carriage,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.080
and Sophie secretly enters. He greets her, and&nbsp;
she asks why he didn't say he knew her sooner.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.200
He explains that he did that for the same&nbsp;
reason as to why they had to go through such&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.680
secretive means to meet. Until now, Sophie&nbsp;
is yet to receive true freedom. Eisenheim&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.840
congratulates her for the upcoming wedding. She&nbsp;
thanks him and says that Leopold is intelligent,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.480
and it would make sense that they marry&nbsp;
because their lives are so intertwined.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.560
She also says that she wished that they&nbsp;
would see each other again, but deep down,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.440
she really wants to say that she hoped&nbsp;
to leave with him back then. They finish&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.800
their conversation, and he leaves. In&nbsp;
her hand is the pendant he gave her.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.480
The two could not escape the watchful eyes&nbsp;
that survey the city as Uhl reads a report&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.480
about how Sophie and Eisenheim&nbsp;
were seen talking in secret.

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.200
A man confronts Eisenheim and leads them to&nbsp;
a restaurant where Uhl eats. Uhl questions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.360
Eisenheim about his relationship with Sophie.&nbsp;
Eisenheim tries to remove any suspicion by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:08.080
being honest about them being childhood friends.&nbsp;
Uhl accepts his answer, but his doubts persist.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.840
He warns the magician of the crown prince's&nbsp;
power and advises him to stay away from Sophie.

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.560
At the royal mansion, Leopold introduces&nbsp;
the magician to the distinguished audience.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.960
He says that what they may see&nbsp;
tonight can seem unexplainable,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:20.880
but he assures that every&nbsp;
mystery will be deciphered.

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:24.960
Eisenheim starts the performance by drawing&nbsp;
a picture of the emperor, who happens to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.520
Leopold's father with just a few gestures of&nbsp;
his hand. Leopold stands and begins to explain&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:34.160
what just happened. He pats Eisenheim down,&nbsp;
trying to look for gadgets but fails to do so.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.320
The crowd reacts negatively because of the prince,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.960
so he challenges the magician to&nbsp;
perform tricks without any props.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.680
He asks for the prince’s sword. He&nbsp;
depicts the legend of the sword Excalibur.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.320
Like how it was set in stone, Leopold's sword&nbsp;
stands upright on its own. The crowd is shocked,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.320
and just as how the unworthy cannot pull&nbsp;
Excalibur, he dares anyone to take the sword.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:57.040
Many tries, but no one prevails. The prince&nbsp;
steps up and cannot lift it just like the others.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:01.760
The audience laughs at him. He finally pulls&nbsp;
the sword on his second try. Eisenheim deems&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:06.240
him worthy, and the audience gives their&nbsp;
applause. However, Leopold is far from happy.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.840
Leopold leaves the room and instructs inspector&nbsp;
Uhl to put a stop to the magician's business.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.400
On horseback, Sophie rides to the home of&nbsp;
Eisenheim. She comes to inform him of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.160
prince’s plan to run him off the city. He&nbsp;
argues with her, saying it doesn’t matter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:22.160
if he leaves. The tension builds up between&nbsp;
the two, and Eisenheim suddenly kisses her.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.433
Eisenheim pins her to the wall and starts to&nbsp;
unbutton her shirt, revealing her pendant. Magic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:26.433 --> 00:05:26.960
is truly in the air that night, as he shows her&nbsp;
that tricks aren't the only thing he's good at.

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:31.120
During their pillow talk, they tell stories about&nbsp;
their lives after the night they got separated.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.440
Eisenheim traveled the world&nbsp;
while Sophie stayed sheltered.

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:38.160
She opens up about Leopold's plans to overthrow&nbsp;
his father. He worries about what could happen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.120
to her and suggests that she comes with him&nbsp;
and disappear just as how they planned when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.720
they were young. However, Sophie fears&nbsp;
that Leopold will find and kill them.

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:50.080
Morning comes, Eisenheim sees his ravaged poster&nbsp;
on his way to the theatre. Out of frustration,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:54.880
Josef berates Eisenheim for provoking the&nbsp;
prince. He doesn't care and asks for his profits.

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:59.680
At the bank, he retrieves all his cash. He&nbsp;
organizes his suitcase and walks down the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.360
streets of the city. He approaches a carriage,&nbsp;
leaves the suitcase, and gets a kiss from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:08.480
Sophie. A man hiding from afar witnesses all of&nbsp;
this and reports his finding to inspector Uhl.

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:11.520
Uhl arrives at the train station.&nbsp;
He spies on Eisenheim and an old&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.520
man talking about the plan to escape with Sophie.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:18.320
Uhl reports his findings to the prince.&nbsp;
Leopold thanks him, showing no signs of anger.

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:22.080
Sophie marches restlessly in&nbsp;
a room, waiting for Leopold.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:26.240
He confronts her, being as upfront as possible&nbsp;
with what he knows. She doesn't deny it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:30.080
causing Leopold to snap at her, showing the&nbsp;
misogynistic and narcissistic man he is.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:34.640
Sophie stays calm and says that she will not&nbsp;
marry him. He slaps her and threatens to do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:38.160
much worse than that if she continues her&nbsp;
behavior. With a calm face, he commands her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:43.040
to ready her bags for their trip to Budapest.&nbsp;
However, she bids farewell and hurries outside.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:47.040
Leopold catches up to her and strikes her with&nbsp;
his sword. She rides the horse unconscious.

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:50.320
Eisenheim looks at his clock and&nbsp;
realizes that Sophie is late.

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:54.160
Morning comes, Sophie's horse walks down&nbsp;
the street with her nowhere to be seen.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:56.720
A man inspects the horse and sees bloodstains.

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:01.120
A group of people searches for the Duchess.&nbsp;
A man sees her floating on the river,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:05.280
stuck in a tree. Eisenheim jumps in the river,&nbsp;
and there in his arms is a lifeless Sophie.

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:09.040
Uhl inspects Sophie's dead&nbsp;
body. The doctor interrupts him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:12.720
saying that he will not stand for the&nbsp;
disrespect he's doing. As he's about to leave,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:16.320
the doctor informs him about a&nbsp;
gemstone found in Sophie's pockets.

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:19.600
Eisenheim confronts Uhl saying that&nbsp;
they both know the prince killed Sophie.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:23.840
Uhl defends Leopold and says he can't have killed&nbsp;
her since he's in Budapest. Trying not to cry,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:27.440
Eisenheim explains that the prince killed&nbsp;
her because she was leaving him. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:32.160
Uhl stands his ground. He asks Eisenheim to stop&nbsp;
accusing the prince or else he'll end up in jail.

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:34.320
Uhl leaves the scene and continues the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:37.760
investigation. He arrives at the&nbsp;
mansion and looks in the stables.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:41.040
He sees a shiny object under the hay but doesn't&nbsp;
get the chance to grab it as the crown prince&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:45.600
arrives. The prince asks Uhl if he has a suspect,&nbsp;
remarkably hiding the fact that he killed her.

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:49.840
Eisenheim receives news that the police&nbsp;
have arrested the man who killed Sophie.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:52.720
However, he's not satisfied and&nbsp;
still thinks Leopold killed her.

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:56.800
Some time passed, and he buys a&nbsp;
rundown theatre, fires his manager,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.400
and completely reimagines his shows.

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:03.520
The day of the reopening came. A packed theatre&nbsp;
watches as the magician sits down and stares at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:07.680
them intently. He gestures his hand toward a&nbsp;
contraption. A sudden image of a man appears.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:10.880
A man from the audience communicates&nbsp;
with him. The audience assumes he's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:12.880
dead and asks him how he got&nbsp;
there and what he knows about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:16.240
the other side. He doesn't know what&nbsp;
to say, and Eisenheim stops the show.

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:20.320
The show starts to grow more&nbsp;
controversial, and a cult following forms.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:23.440
The news reaches the crown prince,&nbsp;
but he doesn't show any concern. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:26.880
says he's a fake and commands Uhl to find&nbsp;
out how he does his trick and arrest him.

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:30.080
The inspector hypothesizes&nbsp;
that he's using a projector,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:32.400
but it doesn't replicate the&nbsp;
lifelike movement of the images.

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:36.480
The show attracts more attention as&nbsp;
the apparitions grow more realistic.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:40.800
Uhl and the guards take Eisenheim to his&nbsp;
office. He asks him how he does his new trick.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:44.400
Eisenheim reminds the inspector that&nbsp;
a magician never reveals his secrets.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:47.360
Their conversation gets interrupted by&nbsp;
Uhl's second in command saying that he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:50.560
should look out the window. A group of&nbsp;
people stands there looking menacingly.

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:54.960
Uhl accuses Eisenheim of planning to&nbsp;
overthrow the prince. Eisenheim says&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:58.640
his plans are far from that. Uhl reminds&nbsp;
him that they already caught the murderer;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:02.960
however, he says they both know that isn't true.&nbsp;
Eisenheim shows himself to the crowd outside; he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:07.120
confesses that the apparitions are only tricks. He&nbsp;
isn't able to bring people back from the dead and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:11.600
apologizes for misleading them. He pleads for them&nbsp;
to go home, and the disappointed crowd follows.

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:17.280
Uhl is satisfied with what happened and lets&nbsp;
him leave. After a while, he reports to Leopold.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:21.200
What he did disappoints the prince; he scolds&nbsp;
him, calling him an untrustworthy fool.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:23.760
The prince leaves and plans to put&nbsp;
an end to Eisenheim personally.

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:28.000
Wearing a disguise, he walks through the&nbsp;
town blending in with the commonfolk.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.640
Leopold enters the theatre and&nbsp;
sits to watch Eisenheim perform.

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:36.400
Fittingly, the show features the image of Sophie.&nbsp;
She gazes at Eisenheim, seeming as though she's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:40.800
real. The audience asks who murdered her, and&nbsp;
Leopold sits anxiously. Sophie announces that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:45.040
her murder is present among the audience. Multiple&nbsp;
voices from the crowd shout that the crown prince&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:50.160
killed her. Luckily, they're unaware of Leopold’s&nbsp;
presence. Sophie vanishes, and the show ends.

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:54.000
In the carriage, the prince remains&nbsp;
skeptical, saying that the apparition&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.920
doesn't even look like Sophie. He accuses&nbsp;
the magician of manipulating the audience,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:00.880
clearly showing that he's bothered&nbsp;
by what happened. In the next show,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:03.516
the prince commands that Uhl shall arrest&nbsp;
Eisenheim to make an example out of him.

00:10:03.516 --> 00:10:07.440
Uhl meets with Eisenheim. He tells him that he&nbsp;
doesn't want to arrest him; however, he'd have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:11.120
no other choice but to do so if he continues&nbsp;
with his act. Sophie's death clearly left&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:14.720
Eisenheim broken as he says that he's only doing&nbsp;
this to be with her, even for a short moment.

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:18.560
Guards surround the building. A&nbsp;
familiar face accompanies Eisenheim.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:22.000
He gives Josef the right to all his&nbsp;
assets, and he agrees without hesitation.

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:26.560
Eisenheim sits in front of a crowd. It's&nbsp;
completely silent as all eyes are on him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:29.440
Sophie appears next to him despite&nbsp;
the warnings of Uhl. People from the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:33.200
audience start accusing the crown prince of&nbsp;
murdering her. Inspector Uhl approaches him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:36.240
and guards surround the platform.&nbsp;
He announces that he'll be arresting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:39.600
Eisenheim. Chaos ensues among the&nbsp;
audience, shouting their disagreement.

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:44.640
When Uhl tries to grab Eisenheim, his hands&nbsp;
go through him. He has turned himself into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:48.560
an apparition and disappears into thin air. The&nbsp;
guards start to look for him in every corner of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:52.640
the theatre, but he's nowhere to be found. They&nbsp;
rummage through his home, and there Uhl notices&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:56.320
a book entitled "Orange Tree." He opens it&nbsp;
to see the sketches of Sophie's pendant.

00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:59.120
He takes another look and realizes something.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:02.800
He visits the barn where Sophie was murdered&nbsp;
and finds the pendant underneath the hay.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:07.120
He figures out how to open it, and he sees the&nbsp;
picture of Eisenheim from before. Beside it, he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:12.317
sees a gemstone. He receives Leopold's sword, and&nbsp;
there he figures out where the gemstones belong.

00:11:12.317 --> 00:11:16.160
He meets with Leopold, and he accuses him of&nbsp;
murdering Sophie. The prince is as arrogant as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:20.480
ever as he says that Uhl has no right to steal&nbsp;
from his property. However, Uhl informs him that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:24.560
he has already said everything to the emperor,&nbsp;
including Leopold's plan to overthrow him. As a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:28.240
final attempt to change Uhl's mind, he says that&nbsp;
Eisenheim has tricked him and that all of this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:32.800
planned by him. Uhl stands his ground, saying that&nbsp;
there's a truth behind the magician's illusions.

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:36.800
Feeling desperate, Leopold grabs&nbsp;
his gun and threatens to shoot Uhl.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:40.480
However, he gets interrupted as he sees officers&nbsp;
sent by the emperor approach the mansion.

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:43.440
Leopold feels helpless and locks all the doors,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:47.040
hoping that this would buy him enough time to&nbsp;
think of something. He shouts to Uhl that all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:50.560
his sacrifices will be for nothing, saying&nbsp;
that he only wants the best for the nation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:54.160
The banging on the doors triggers him, and with&nbsp;
his finger on the trigger, he shoots himself.

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:58.960
The newly promoted Uhl walks down the&nbsp;
street, and a child approaches him;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:02.720
he gives him a document that explains the&nbsp;
mechanism behind the orange tree trick.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:05.920
He looks around and runs after a&nbsp;
man that's obviously in disguise.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:10.400
It's Eisenheim, well and alive. Uhl arrives at&nbsp;
the train station, barely missing the magician.

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:14.320
Uhl experiences a moment of revelation&nbsp;
as he pieces everything together.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:18.560
From the beginning, Eisenheim had planned all of&nbsp;
this, meticulously getting every detail right,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:23.920
ensuring the success of his plan. The gemstones&nbsp;
he grabbed when he borrowed Leopold's sword,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:27.360
the old man he was talking to who happened to be&nbsp;
the doctor that examined Sophie, and up to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:31.680
faking of Sophie's death. Planting all of these&nbsp;
ideas into Uhl's head, making him think that he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:36.000
got close to the truth, not realizing that the&nbsp;
magician was a step ahead of him the entire time.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.440
Uhl can't help but laugh and clap to the&nbsp;
unbelievable performance he became a part of.

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:43.120
Eisenheim walks through the meadows&nbsp;
to celebrate with Sophie as they've&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:45.440
now fulfilled their promise to disappear together.
