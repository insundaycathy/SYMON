00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.769
Welcome back for another 5 minute movie recap.

00:00:02.769 --> 00:00:07.410
Today, I'm going to give you an overview of
the 2018 American horror film called 'A Quiet

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:08.460
Place'.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.799
The film is directed by John Krasinski and
written by Bryan Woods, Scott Beck and Krasinski.

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.760
The storey focuses on a father and a mother
who have to contend with blind creatures with

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.230
an incredible sense of hearing while they
fight to keep their family alive and well

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.360
in a post-apocalyptic world.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.750
Warning: there will be spoilers ahead, so
please proceed with caution.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.390
After 89 days, the majority of Earth's human
population has been destroyed by blind monsters

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.600
with acute hearing who attack everything that
makes a sound.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:41.289
A layer of armor-like skin covers the extraterrestrial
beings, which resist bullets and explosions.

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:46.589
In a desolate town, the Abbott familyâ€”wife
Evelyn, husband Lee, Regan, a deaf teenage

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:51.800
daughter, and Lee's younger sons Marcus and
Beauâ€”seek for supplies while remaining quiet.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.030
When the family is outdoors, they use American
Sign Language to communicate.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.360
Four-year-old Beau is intrigued to a battery-powered
space shuttle toy, but because the item would

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.630
create noise, his brother, six-year-old Lee,
snatches it away.

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:08.280
Beau replaces the batteries, then gives the
toy back to Regan.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.210
When the family is crossing a bridge, Beau
activates the toy, and it causes a neighbouring

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.070
monster to murder him.

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.570
Over a year after the incident, Regan continues
to suffer with guilt, Evelyn is pregnant with

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.780
her last child, and Lee is trying to establish
radio communication with the outside world.

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.040
Lee uses scavenged amplifiers to attempt to
improve Regan's cochlear implant, but the

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.640
implants fail.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.620
Lee takes Marcus to a neighbouring river with
a huge waterfall where he teaches him to fish

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:38.150
while Regan visits Beau's monument, which
is located far away from the two of them.

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.160
When other strong background noise makes it
harder for the animals to hear, Lee informs

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.770
Marcus it is safe to communicate.

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.500
Regan claims that she believes she bears some
responsibility for Beau's death and requires

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.850
her father to affirm that he loves her.

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.850
At the home, Evelyn goes into labour when
she is all alone.

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.370
As she was heading to the basement, she stepped
on an exposed nail and dropped a glass picture

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.670
frame, making a nearby critter aware of her
presence.

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.660
Once she flicks the switch, the external home
lights become red to indicate to the others

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:07.370
that she is in labour.

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:11.580
Lee arrives to the property and tells Marcus
to blow off pyrotechnics as a ruse to cover

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.580
their approach.

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.840
When Lee discovers that Evelyn is hiding in
the toilet with their newborn boy, he's upset.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.760
As a result, they find themselves in the makeshift
soundproofed basement.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.959
Lee departs to look for the other children.

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:27.219
While Evelyn is asleep, she discovers that
a pipe has broken, causing the basement to

00:02:27.219 --> 00:02:29.849
flood, and that an intruder is in the house
with her.

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:34.319
The siblings notify their father by building
a fire on top of a grain silo and taking cover

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:35.579
inside of it.

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:39.519
Yet, before Lee notices, the fire runs out
of lighter fluid.

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:43.819
Marcus unexpectedly falls into the silo as
a hatch door breaks way.

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:47.599
The door that falls confuses the monster that
was following Evelyn, causing it to switch

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:50.489
its attention to Marcus and Regan instead.

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:54.939
While Marcus dives in after Marcus, who had
already plunged in, Regan nearly suffocates

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:57.249
in the corn but Marcus saves her.

00:02:57.249 --> 00:03:01.609
The cochlear implant emits a high-frequency
sound to deter the organism.

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:05.400
As the children break out of the silo, they
encounter their father.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.260
The thing reappears, striking Lee and injuring
him.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.079
Marcus and Regan seek refuge in a vehicle,
but they are found and attacked by the creature.

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:17.620
Drawing the creature's attention away from
his father to the truck, Marcus yells.

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.579
Before he yells to attract the monster, Lee
signals to Regan that he loves her and always

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:22.650
has.

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.590
It assaults and then kills Lee.

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.299
While Regan and Marcus attempt to get away
from the approaching army, they deliberately

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:32.129
roll their truck down a hill in order to reconnect
with Evelyn and their infant daughter at the

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:33.389
farmhouse.

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:35.400
They all head downstairs to hide.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.860
Regan, who has learned to recognise the sound
of the implant, does it again, only this time

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.159
she connects the device to a microphone that
is amplified.

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:47.450
The monster's exposed skin provides Evelyn
with a clear shot, allowing her to execute

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:49.079
the thing with a shotgun.

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:53.549
The family witnesses a CCTV monitor, which
shows two monsters heading toward the house

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:55.659
where a gunshot has been fired.

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:59.069
As a result of this information, Evelyn loads
her gun again.
