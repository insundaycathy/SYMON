00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.520
Story Recapped here. Today,&nbsp;
I'm going to explain an action,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:08.240
crime, and sci-fi film called "Robocop."&nbsp;
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.320
A local news station reports about&nbsp;
dead and injured police officers.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.840
Omni Consumer Products or O.C.P. is the&nbsp;
firm responsible for the operations of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.000
Detroit Metropolitan Police Department.&nbsp;
The president of O.C.P, Richard Jones,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.880
states that police officers who can't handle&nbsp;
the risks should look for a career change.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:30.080
Clarence Boddicker, a crime boss in Old Detroit,&nbsp;
is the prime suspect for the police killings.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.560
Two lawyers harass Sergeant John Reed in the Metro&nbsp;
West precinct until he snaps and throws them out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:42.080
As they leave, Murphy, a cop from the Metro&nbsp;
South precinct, reports his transfer to John&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.080
and suits up for his first day on the job. In&nbsp;
the showers, the police staff complain about the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:51.040
new management. A fellow cop suggests planning a&nbsp;
strike. Unfortunately, John enters and hears it.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.960
John removes the nameplate on officer&nbsp;
Frederickson's locker, the officer that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.360
died from the police killings. Everyone is&nbsp;
silent as he announces the upcoming funeral.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.960
He then addresses their plan to have a strike,&nbsp;
saying the city will crumble without the police.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.640
In the lobby of the precinct, Murphy&nbsp;
watches an officer and a fugitive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.840
fight. The man catches punches from Officer&nbsp;
Ann Lewis, who catches Murphy's attention.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.840
Murphy is her new partner, and they venture&nbsp;
out, playfully conversing in the vehicle.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:21.200
In the O.C.P. headquarters, the C.E.O. unveils&nbsp;
the model of Delta City, which will be built on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.720
the grounds of Old Detroit, purging the&nbsp;
area of crime and unwanted communities.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.920
Bob Morton stands out when he applauds first.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.000
Richard Jones makes his way to the podium&nbsp;
to present his plans for the Detroit Police&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.400
Department. He created a cop who works every&nbsp;
hour of every day, doesn't need sleep or food,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.800
and is overall superior. He opens the&nbsp;
doors, revealing the machine ED 209.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.360
It walks to the board members, who watch&nbsp;
it with both fear and awe. A volunteer,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.880
Mr. Kinney, aims a gun at ED for demonstration.&nbsp;
The machine threatens him to drop the weapon,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.200
which he complies with. But ED continues&nbsp;
to threaten him. The engineers scramble to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.560
try and disable the machine while Kinney&nbsp;
runs behind the board members for help.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.240
Out of fear, they push him away, leaving him&nbsp;
defenseless as ED showers him with bullets.

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.040
While the others handle the accident, the C.E.O.&nbsp;
expresses disappointment over the project.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.280
Richard claims that it's only a minor setback, but&nbsp;
the C.E.O doesn't see a 50-million dollar setback&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.440
as minor. Bob interrupts their discussion&nbsp;
to inform them about the RoboCop project.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.560
The C.E.O. gives him a chance&nbsp;
despite Richard disagreeing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.640
Bob says that he has already selected candidates&nbsp;
from the police department. It'll only take&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.640
three months for the prototype. He gets the&nbsp;
C.E.O.'s approval, leaving Richard furious.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.440
In the streets of Detroit, Murphy practices his&nbsp;
gunslinging tricks, having learned the tricks to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.120
impress his son. They hear an announcement&nbsp;
on the radio that leads them to a robbery.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.360
In the robber's van, Clarence berates&nbsp;
his goons for burning the stolen money.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.520
They're on a chase with Murphy and Ann, but&nbsp;
their vehicle is too slow to outrun the police.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.440
So Clarence commands the driver to slow down.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.720
With a gun in each hand, Murphy prepares to shoot.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.240
Clarence and his goons are ready for him,&nbsp;
opening the doors to see an empty road.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.560
The car maneuvers beside the van, and a shootout&nbsp;
commences on the highway. Murphy hits the leg&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.200
of one of the goons causing the rest of&nbsp;
them to fire with everything they've got.

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.600
Clarence picks up the injured goon and throws him&nbsp;
toward the police car, shattering the windshield&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.520
and making Ann lose control. Murphy pushes the&nbsp;
injured goon off and resumes their pursuit.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.760
They arrive at an abandoned mill with&nbsp;
no backup coming. Despite the danger,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.480
Ann decides to chase after them. The van is empty.&nbsp;
Clarence and his goons are nowhere to be seen.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.360
The two separate to cover&nbsp;
as much area as possible,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.000
sneaking within the shadows and&nbsp;
checking every corner of the buildings.

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.720
Ann sees a man relieving himself, and the pop&nbsp;
of her bubblegum disrupts the flow of urine.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.880
The man, Joe, turns around with&nbsp;
his hands up and zippers down.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.880
Ann can't help but take a peek, allowing Joe&nbsp;
to attack and push her over the railings.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:40.080
Meanwhile, Murphy hears the goons talking about&nbsp;
their plans. Emil and the other goon watch their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.720
favorite show, unaware of the gun pointing at&nbsp;
them. Murphy jumps, holding them at gunpoint.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.880
The other man grabs his shotgun but gets shot&nbsp;
for it. Emil drops his weapon and surrenders.

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.840
On the radio, Ann hears Murphy reporting his&nbsp;
situation. Suddenly, the rest of the goons&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:59.040
surround him. He drops his guard, and Emil strikes&nbsp;
his gun away. Hopelessness grows as three shotguns&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.920
aim at his head. Clarence enters the scene and&nbsp;
confronts the officer. He mocks Murphy, breathing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.720
down his neck and striking his calves. Clarence&nbsp;
knocks him around, asking where his partner is.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:13.600
Joe enters, saying that she's taken care of. They&nbsp;
circle him like sharks to their prey. Clarence&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.680
aims up and down Murphy's body while making&nbsp;
robotic sounds. The goons roar with laughter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.920
when Clarence shoots Murphy's hand off. A bloody&nbsp;
Murphy tries to escape, but he turns around to see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:26.720
them aiming at him. He shouts in pain as shotgun&nbsp;
shells rain on him. Clarence finishes him off with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:31.360
a bullet to the head before leaving. Ann rushes to&nbsp;
his aid, finding her partner bloody on the floor.

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.640
Medical professionals surround a&nbsp;
helicopter carrying the dying policeman.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.680
They rush him inside, transferring&nbsp;
him to the operating table.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.360
While the doctors struggle to revive him,&nbsp;
Murphy sees his life flash before his eyes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.760
reliving moments with his son and wife. Everything&nbsp;
turns black as the doctors fail to keep him alive.

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.480
After some time, static flashes from a&nbsp;
display and scientists appear in view.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:53.680
Bob and his partner discuss&nbsp;
adjustments for the RoboCop operation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.520
After months of developing the cyborg,&nbsp;
Bob looks at it and praises his creation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.200
The time comes for Bob to present RoboCop to&nbsp;
the group, and they shower him with applause.

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:05.680
In the precinct, Bob and his team&nbsp;
enter, causing a fuss that angers John.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.200
However, he becomes speechless as the&nbsp;
sound of metal clangs from the entrance.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:12.880
RoboCop catches everyone's attention.&nbsp;
The police staff chase after him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:16.880
watching as the head engineer presents RoboCop's&nbsp;
features. He leads them to a machine that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:21.280
dispenses RoboCop's food, and they test RoboCop&nbsp;
to make sure that his prime directives are set.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.880
RoboCop's screen lists his three directives,&nbsp;
with the fourth one marked as classified.

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.840
In a gun range, Ann practices her shooting.&nbsp;
She sees from afar a metal hand firing with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:34.880
pinpoint accuracy. Everyone watches in awe as he&nbsp;
obliterates the practice target. Bob asks John&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:39.200
for the keys to RoboCop's vehicle, and he catches&nbsp;
it without even looking. Bob admires him like a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:43.920
proud father. RoboCop rides out to the city, and&nbsp;
the streets of Detroit instantly become safer.

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:49.200
In a convenience store, a man enters to buy a&nbsp;
magazine. He approaches the cashier and asks for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:53.920
all their money. The lady is hesitant, but his gun&nbsp;
persuades her. As the lady puts the money in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:58.880
bag, she presses the panic button. RoboCop enters&nbsp;
the store, and the man realizes he’s screwed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:03.200
He frustratingly fires at the indestructible&nbsp;
metal shell. RoboCop bends the barrel easily&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:06.880
and smacks the thief. He thanks the owner&nbsp;
for cooperating and wishes them goodnight.

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:10.000
Two delinquents harass a&nbsp;
woman walking down the street.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.760
They hold her still to cut her hair. They&nbsp;
aren't satisfied and plan to cut the hair below.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:17.760
RoboCop arrives right on time and shoots&nbsp;
the man between the woman's skirt.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:21.040
He falls to the floor with a bloody crotch,&nbsp;
and the woman runs to thank RoboCop.

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:24.960
Commotion occurs in front of the city hall&nbsp;
as a former councilman holds the mayor and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:29.520
his staff hostage. RoboCop arrives at the&nbsp;
scene, and reporters quickly surround him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:33.040
He enters the building while the police&nbsp;
outside negotiate with the hostage-taker.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:35.600
As he voices out his demands,&nbsp;
RoboCop nears the room.

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:39.600
RoboCop uses his thermal vision to&nbsp;
look through the walls. The former&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:42.640
councilman pushes the mayor's face into the&nbsp;
window threatening to blow his head off.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:46.160
Then, RoboCop pulls him through the&nbsp;
wall and punches him out the window.

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.320
The news of RoboCop spreads throughout the city,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:52.160
instilling fear in criminals and hope for&nbsp;
the masses. Aside from his immense skill,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:54.880
RoboCop manifests a charm that&nbsp;
makes kids and adults adore him.

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:59.680
The news anchor reports about the O.C.P.'s&nbsp;
construction of Delta city. Bob, the new&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:04.080
vice president of O.C.P., tells the media that&nbsp;
RoboCop will eliminate all crime in Old Detroit.

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:08.160
In the bathroom, Bob and a colleague&nbsp;
talk about his recent achievements.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:12.480
They gossip about how Richard lost his touch. The&nbsp;
other employees leave the bathroom as the toilet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:17.120
flushes in one of the stalls. Richard exits and&nbsp;
congratulates Bob, noting how he also once talked&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:21.920
bad about his superiors. The difference is,&nbsp;
Richard knew not to cross the line. He berates&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:27.120
him about ruining his plan with ED 209, but Bob&nbsp;
remains unfazed and says that RoboCop is better.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:29.840
Richard threatens Bob, saying that&nbsp;
he’ll regret making him his enemy.

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:34.480
In the precinct, RoboCop is going through&nbsp;
maintenance. He twitches in his chair,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:38.400
and the readings in the machine fluctuate.&nbsp;
Clarence appears in his head, and he remembers the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:43.200
day he and his goons killed him. The display shows&nbsp;
his visions, and the engineers finally notice.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:46.720
RoboCop stands and starts walking out,&nbsp;
ignoring the commands from his creators.

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:51.120
RoboCop passes Ann in a corridor, who runs&nbsp;
after him and tries to introduce herself.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:56.320
She recognizes him as Murphy, but RoboCop turns&nbsp;
away from her. The lead engineer shouts at Ann to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:00.640
stop the cyborg. RoboCop leaves the vicinity,&nbsp;
and the lead engineer blames Ann for it.

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:06.160
At a gas station, Emil robs a studying attendant.&nbsp;
RoboCop is in the distance, on his way to arrest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:09.920
him. Emil bullies the bookworm, saying that&nbsp;
being smart won't save him from a bullet.

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:15.440
They aim at one another, and Emil realizes that&nbsp;
RoboCop is Murphy. To escape, Emil shoots at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:20.080
gas hose while RoboCop stands still, seemingly&nbsp;
malfunctioning. Emil throws his cigarette before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:24.480
driving away, and the gas station explodes.&nbsp;
RoboCop moves just in time and starts shooting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:29.360
at Emil, causing him to crash. As his first&nbsp;
display of emotions, RoboCop asks who Emil is.

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:34.240
RoboCop returns to the precinct. He inserts&nbsp;
his metal spike into the terminal to access&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:39.280
the criminal database and searches for Emil. There&nbsp;
he sees his accomplices; among them is Clarence.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:43.840
He looks at the file of his murder and realizes&nbsp;
who he is. In his profile, he sees his address.

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:48.560
RoboCop visits his home that is currently for&nbsp;
sale. He remembers where all his belongings&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:52.080
once were and sees the image of his son.&nbsp;
He makes his way to the kitchen and sees&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:56.240
a picture of his family. He crushes it in&nbsp;
his hands and continues to their bedroom.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:59.680
Remembering his wife, all kinds of emotions&nbsp;
rush into him, making him unstable.

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:04.320
At a club, RoboCop walks through the&nbsp;
partying crowd. He's in an arrest mode,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:08.240
and there he confronts one of Clarence's&nbsp;
goons, Nash. Nash tries to pull out a gun,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:13.040
but he quickly disposes of it. He then tries a&nbsp;
cheap shot only to be met with a crotch of steel.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:14.720
RoboCop drags him by the hair to talk.

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:20.000
Meanwhile, Bob is having a party of his own with&nbsp;
drugs and women. Bob flirts with the two, sniffing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.400
snow off the mountain's valley. He has his hands&nbsp;
and faces full with the women, but suddenly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:28.720
the doorbell rings, interrupting the fun.&nbsp;
Clarence, with a gun in his hand, makes the women&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:33.440
leave. He puts on a silencer and shoots Bob's&nbsp;
legs. Clarence plays a video of Richard saying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:38.080
that this is Bob’s fault for making him his enemy.&nbsp;
Clarence reveals a grenade, bites off the pin, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:42.400
leaves Bob to crawl for it. He struggles to reach&nbsp;
it, and Richard smiles as the house explodes.

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:47.360
In a factory, goons line up to pack drugs.&nbsp;
Clarence talks to Sal, the owner of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:52.480
factory. He shows him the money he intends to use&nbsp;
to buy the product. Due to his reputation, Sal is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:57.360
reluctant to do business with him. Clarence dips&nbsp;
his finger in Sal's wine, and Sal then drinks it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:01.840
His sweet words don't persuade Sal, and instead,&nbsp;
it makes the situation sour as the goons aim their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:05.920
guns at each other. Clarence is unbothered&nbsp;
by the tense situation, making Sal agree.

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:09.840
They begin to hear banging on the doors,&nbsp;
alerting everyone in the building.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:14.160
RoboCop knocks the entrance down and searches&nbsp;
for Clarence. The goons start firing at him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:19.120
but he takes no damage at all. He shoots them off&nbsp;
one by one, displaying his gunslinging skills.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:23.200
With every step and every shot, their numbers&nbsp;
dwindle. Clarence leaves his goons behind,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:27.680
and he tries to jump but falls through the thin&nbsp;
material. RoboCop grabs him, recites the Miranda&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:32.080
rights but gets interrupted by spit, so he throws&nbsp;
him through the glass. RoboCop approaches him and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:36.160
throws him again. With blood dripping from&nbsp;
his face, Clarence snitches on Richard Jones&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:40.480
before getting thrown against a window for the&nbsp;
third time. Now even bloodier, RoboCop lifts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:45.040
him by the neck, prepared to eliminate Clarence.&nbsp;
However, his directives stop him from doing so.

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:50.160
In the precinct, John argues with the police&nbsp;
staff as they're planning to strike. RoboCop&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:54.400
silences the room, handing Clarence to the&nbsp;
men. Clarence spits on the form at the table,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:55.840
confidently asking for his phone call.

00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:59.120
Richard Jones is in a heated&nbsp;
phone call with Clarence.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:02.720
He assures him that he'll take care of everything&nbsp;
and that he'll be soon out of the precinct.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:05.440
Meanwhile, RoboCop makes his&nbsp;
way to O.C.P. headquarters.

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:09.120
RoboCop enters the building and&nbsp;
rides the elevator to the top floor,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:13.680
where Richard awaits him. He replays Clarence's&nbsp;
confession as he approaches Richard's office.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:18.160
Richard greets the cyborg and asks what his&nbsp;
purpose is. RoboCop announces his arrest, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:23.040
Richard accepts with open arms. As he approaches&nbsp;
Richard, he begins to malfunction. Richard informs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:27.120
him about a secret directive, where RoboCop isn't&nbsp;
allowed to arrest any senior officer of O.C.P.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:31.520
RoboCop tries to fight his program. The&nbsp;
situation worsens when ED enters the room.

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:35.920
ED showers the cyborg with bullets&nbsp;
and flings him to the wall. Meanwhile,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:40.480
Richard reports the commotion to the police.&nbsp;
RoboCop sees an opening and grabs ED's firing arm,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:44.080
pointing it to the other. The robot still&nbsp;
operates and fires multiple missiles in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:48.880
RoboCop's direction. He barely dodges and makes&nbsp;
his way to the stairwell with ED close behind.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:52.560
ED tumbles down because of its large feet,&nbsp;
and RoboCop leaves the struggling robot.

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:56.880
Outside, he is met with the police's&nbsp;
bright lights. The officer in command&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:00.160
orders the rest to fire at the cyborg,&nbsp;
and some officers shout in disagreement.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:04.480
Still, they fire at RoboCop, and his&nbsp;
hard shell gets chipped little by little.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:07.360
He experiences a more gruesome attack&nbsp;
than his first death as this time,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:11.360
it’s the police shooting and not a criminal.&nbsp;
They corner him, but RoboCop escapes through the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:15.120
highway where Ann encounters him. She carries&nbsp;
him to her vehicle, and they barely escape.

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:19.680
The local news station reports breaking news of&nbsp;
the Detroit Police Department city-wide strike.

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:24.880
Days later, a free Clarence visits O.C.P.&nbsp;
headquarters. He enters Richard's office, where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:28.320
he's scolded for snitching on him to RoboCop,&nbsp;
saying that the police can use his memories&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:33.360
against him. To prevent this, Richard commands&nbsp;
Clarence to kill RoboCop. Clarence is reluctant&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:37.600
initially but agrees when Richard offers him the&nbsp;
chance to manage illegal businesses in Delta City.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:40.560
Richard gives him RoboCop's radar and&nbsp;
all the firepower he can dream of.

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:44.560
In the abandoned mill, RoboCop&nbsp;
repairs himself with help from Ann.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:48.560
She brings him his gun, a drill, and&nbsp;
some food. RoboCop removes the screws&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:52.240
on his helmet to reveal Murphy's heavily&nbsp;
modified head. Hearing about his family,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:55.680
who moved away to start over, RoboCop&nbsp;
becomes emotional and asks Ann to leave.

00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:59.520
Crime prospers in the streets of&nbsp;
Detroit as the police are on strike.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:02.880
Emil breaks the window of an electronic&nbsp;
store to watch his favorite show.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:06.880
Clarence and the rest of the squad reunites.&nbsp;
He shows them his new weaponry and tests it on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:11.040
his goon's brand new vehicle. After wreaking more&nbsp;
havoc, they make their way to the abandoned mill.

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:16.080
Ann peacefully sleeps when RoboCop wakes her with&nbsp;
the sound of his firearm. His targeting system is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:19.840
malfunctioning, and Ann helps him fix it, allowing&nbsp;
him to shoot the jars of food from a distance.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:23.520
They hear Clarence and his goons arrive,&nbsp;
each with their own Assault Cannons.

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:27.440
RoboCop asks her to leave, but she&nbsp;
reminds him that they're partners.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:30.880
He throws a piece of metal that catches&nbsp;
the enemy's attention. He shouts in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:33.920
high ground and shoots one of the&nbsp;
goons. The rest starts shooting,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:38.800
but he remains unscathed. Emil approaches RoboCop&nbsp;
in a van at extreme speeds, but RoboCop dodges,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:43.520
revealing the toxic waste storage behind him.&nbsp;
Emil arises from the acid, melted and disfigured.

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:47.280
Clarence drives to cut off&nbsp;
RoboCop, but Ann intercepts him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:51.120
During their car chase, Emil walks in front&nbsp;
of Clarence's vehicle, filling the windshield&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:55.840
with blood that causes Clarence to crash. Ann&nbsp;
arrives at the scene, and Clarence shoots her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:55.840 --> 00:14:00.080
RoboCop distracts Clarence but is unaware that&nbsp;
Nash is above them. Ann sees this and crawls to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:03.920
the assault cannon. Clarence drops his gun&nbsp;
and convincingly surrenders to lure him in.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:08.400
Large metal beams drop onto RoboCop, and the&nbsp;
criminals celebrate until Ann fires the assault&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:13.120
cannon on Nash. Clarence grabs a metal bar and&nbsp;
starts smacking the still conscious RoboCop.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:16.960
Clarence pierces him with the metal, and&nbsp;
RoboCop pierces his neck with his metal spike.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:19.680
Clarence bleeds out, and the two&nbsp;
cops survive to see another day.

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:25.760
In the O.C.P. headquarters, Richard plans to send&nbsp;
ED 209s all over the city to replace the police.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:29.600
Outside, RoboCop arrives at the&nbsp;
entrance, and an ED robot spots him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:33.200
It rushes towards him, but a calm RoboCop&nbsp;
shoots ED with the Assault Cannon.

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:36.480
As the board members applaud Richard,&nbsp;
RoboCop enters the conference room and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:40.720
reports Richard's criminal charges to the&nbsp;
C.E.O. RoboCop inserts his metal spike into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:44.960
the displays. Richard’s confession of killing&nbsp;
Bob plays on the screens. Feeling trapped,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:49.040
Richard takes the C.E.O. hostage and threatens&nbsp;
to kill him if anyone tries to intervene.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:52.560
The C.E.O. then fires Richard, and the&nbsp;
warning for the fourth directive disappears,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:56.480
allowing RoboCop to shoot Richards. Richard&nbsp;
falls through the window and meets his demise.

00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:59.760
The C.E.O. commends his gunslinging&nbsp;
skills and asks for his name.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:02.240
RoboCop introduces himself as Murphy.

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:07.440
War on drugs and crime, in general, prevails&nbsp;
during these times. The government’s action to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:12.160
combat it is, of course, violence. They resort&nbsp;
to endangering the lives of police officers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:16.880
and civilians to purge Old Detroit of crime. To&nbsp;
alleviate the fear, they integrate technology and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:22.560
a sort of disposable solution. RoboCop and ED 209&nbsp;
are examples of such. What they didn’t account for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:26.880
is RoboCop turning on his creators. The overturn&nbsp;
of power sheds light on the truth that corrupt,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:30.000
mechanized, and militarized systems&nbsp;
might be the true crime behind it all.
