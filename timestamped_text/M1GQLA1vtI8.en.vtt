00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:08.069
Welcome to Cinema Summary, ladies and gentlemen.

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.330
Today’s movie is all about one question: What
would you do for a million dollars?

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:14.639
This is the Box

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.800
The movie starts with a classified document.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.760
It’s about this guy named Arlington Steward
He had a terrible accident

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.300
which we will find out about later.

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.720
After his accident he starts making these
weird, wooden boxes

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:27.740
and delivering them to people.

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.500
Norma Lewis, a woman who lives in Richmond,
Virginia.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.460
Finds one of these boxes on her doorstep one day.

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.500
It’s morning, it’s foggy and there is
a black car driving away.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.500
She brings it inside, and her, her husband,

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.000
and her kid try to figure out what it is.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.520
The box is locked but through the see-through
cover they can see a big red button

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.920
They find a note a note with the box and it says that

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.700
Mr. Steward will visit them at 5:00 PM

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.000
and none of them know who Mr. Steward is

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.860
Okay, real quick, I'm gonna introduce you to the family

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.660
before we get to the real crazy stuff, okay?

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.720
So, Arthur the Dad works at NASA

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.720
Norma the Mom is a school teacher

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.210
and Walter the Kid studies at the same school that his mom teaches at.

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:08.710
Together they are the Lewis Family

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.360
They leave home to go to work and in class, a creepy kid

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.400
asks Norma why she limps and we find
out that Norma’s foot is disfigured

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:19.880
Later, at school.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.079
She meets the principal.

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:25.560
Who tells her that the discount given to the
teachers who have kids at the same school

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.800
has been cancelled.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.260
And oddly enough, when they are done talking,
the principal gets a nose bleed.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:36.260
Back at home, Norma hears the doorbell ring

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.689
and she opens the door to see: A man with a burned face.

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.799
Norma is shocked by his appearance and almost
doesn’t let him.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.280
Until he introduces himself

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.400
"My name is Arlington Steward."

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.100
Inside, he gives her an envelope with a key inside.

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.700
The key that opens the glass cover.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.289
and he tells her that if you push the button 2 things
will happen

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:02.899
1) Someone, somewhere in the world will die
2) You will get 1 million dollars in cash

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:08.410
In a briefcase just like this one and before he leaves he gives her a $100 bill

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.360
for her kindness. Huh.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.080
She doesn’t believe him and in fact she’s
freaked out by him.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.960
But he convinces her that

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.680
It’s all real and if she presses the button,
she will find out the truth

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.400
and the money is all hers

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:26.700
So Arthur is at work building a fake foot
for Norma so she can walk normally.

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.640
When he gets a letter from his boss.

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.000
He has been rejected from the astronaut training
program.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.280
He cannot be an astronaut because he failed
his psychological evaluation.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.640
That evening, Arthur opens up the box with
Norma and they find out that it is just wood.

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.720
There is no way this box could send any signal
or message to anyone.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.000
and even after this, they still do not know if
they should press the button.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.120
At NASA the next day, a man receives a phone
call from his wife.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.320
and she’s freaking out because their daughter
has been kidnapped.

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.340
So he drives to meet her, and we see someone
spying on him.

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.000
Arthur comes back home to tell Norma that
The $100 bill she got is real because

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.840
he tested it and they begin to feel greedy.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.240
Suddenly, Norma presses the button, after all:

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.180
"It's just a box."

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.780
Someone has dialed the 911 (the police)

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.500
the person calling said they heard screaming and gunshots.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.480
The police are on their way to the crime scene
where a neighbor tells them there was a guy

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.980
with a briefcase who drove off.

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.380
Inside the home, the police find a woman shot
dead and a little girl locked in a bathroom.

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.550
The door bell rings at the Lewis’s home

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.400
Arlington Steward has come back

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.760
He asks for the key back and opens his briefcase.

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.320
The Lewis’s are shocked and horrified!
Arthur asks Steward if someone died.

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.640
To which Steward says

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.020
“Well of course someone died."

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.060
then Norma asks Steward what he will do next

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.300
and he tells them that he will take the Box to

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.520
another family and make the same offer to them.

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:02.560
He leaves the briefcase full of cash and the
house taking the box with him

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.020
but Arthur can’t handle this. He's guilty,

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.880
and tries to return the money but Steward drives off

00:04:08.891 --> 00:04:10.890
and Arthur gets the license plate and rushes back in.

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.560
At the police station, we learn more about
the murder.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.700
The police think that the woman’s husband
might be the killer.

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:20.620
but it doesn’t make sense: He’s a good guy, never hurt his wife,

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:21.910
Never committed a crime.

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:23.060
Who is the husband?

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:28.360
Jeff Carnes: The same guy who got the phone
call from earlier and was being spied on.

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.280
That night, Arthur gives Norma the fake foot.

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.900
and we see how she is able to walk normally now.

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:35.760
Together they go to a wedding rehearsal dinner.

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.594
There they meet Norma’s parents

00:04:37.594 --> 00:04:40.794
and Arthur wins a prize and he chooses a present.

00:04:40.794 --> 00:04:45.150
He opens the present and Inside is a photo
of Arlington Steward.

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.510
and then he sees the creepy kid from Norma’s class.

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:49.500
Holding 2 fingers up.

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.920
At home with Walter and Dana the Babysitter.

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.720
Dana sees something

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.050
We don’t get a clear picture.

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:57.420
But we can also see something or someone.

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:59.960
Standing outside of the window.

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.180
She doesn’t say anything about what she
sees but

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:05.460
Dana does ask to see some of Arthur’s other stuff.

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:08.620
So, Walter takes her downstairs to the basement.

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:12.480
Arthur has a private talk with his father-in-law
who works for the police.

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:15.740
Asking him to find information on Arlington
Steward

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:17.960
by searching for Steward’s license plate.

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.380
Norma is told she has a phone call waiting
for her by waiter.

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:24.540
and at first, the waiter is confused but then
gives her the phone.

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:27.070
The waiter leaves and gets a nosebleed.

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:31.700
Okay, now you’re gonna notice something, different
people are going to start bleeding from the nose

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:35.320
Now there is a reason for this and I will tell you later, but stick with me.

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:36.580
Back to the movie

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:38.960
On the phone, Steward and Norma talk.

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:40.919
Steward tells her that he knows that Arthur

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:42.830
told the police about his license plates.

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:44.120
He knows about this since.

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:45.691
"He has many employees."

00:05:45.691 --> 00:05:48.120
Huh, creepy and what’s even creepier.

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.080
Is that he tells her that actions have consequences.

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.320
And to ‘enjoy the party’

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:56.360
Arthur sees the creepy kid from earlier laughing
at him.

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.360
He yells at him outside.

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:58.460
“Why are you laughing?”.

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.810
“Do you think my wife’s foot is funny?”

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:05.360
He’s angry and loud and everyone sees this, including Norma.

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.680
So, they leave before Arthur does something bad.

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:11.380
and as they drive away one of the valet’s
raises 2 fingers.

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:15.020
When they get home, Arthur drives the babysitter
to her motel

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:17.920
and during this drive, the babysitter starts talking.

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:21.360
Saying creepy things like “You have blood
on your hands"

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:22.880
“Somebody pushing your buttons?"

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:25.420
and warns him to “Look at the light”.

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:26.710
Then she blacks out.

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:28.330
and as soon as they get to her motel.

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:29.330
She wakes up!

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:30.480
And tells Arthur.

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:33.780
He is in danger and that only he can save
himself.

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:36.160
Then the babysitter gets a nosebleed.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.040
She goes to her room and as she’s walking.

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:42.840
People just stand outside their rooms watching
her and we hear a broadcast.

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:44.920
About spaceflight technology.

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:50.140
She goes into her room and there’s a wall
with photos of Norma, Arthur, and Walter

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:52.980
and other information connecting them together.

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:53.980
And she’s looking at this.

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:56.740
Like she’s seen this for the first time.

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:57.640
It’s weird.

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:02.340
Outside we see a group of people standing
around a glowing swimming pool

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:07.000
When he gets home, Arthur asks Norma how she
knows Dana the Babysitter

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.320
She tells him, she met her on a field trip
and that Dana is from Richmond but then Arthur

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:13.620
shows her Dana’s drivers license:

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:17.180
Her real name is Sara and she is from Boston.

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:19.200
That night, Arthur goes downstairs.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:24.440
To check the photo of Steward he got from
the party and he finds that it matches the

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:30.680
photo in his basement. The photo of the people who worked on the Viking 1 Probe

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:35.910
The next morning, Norma answers the phone.

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:39.263
It’s Mr. Steward, who asks where Arthur
went and he asks

00:07:39.263 --> 00:07:42.200
if Arthur is investigating something he shouldn’t.

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:46.060
Norma asks if Dana is one of his employees
and all he has to say is

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:47.640
“I have many employees”.

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:49.820
She asks to meet him face-to-face.

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:52.270
and Steward tells her that he’s in her backyard.

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:55.190
and outside, there’s some random dude.

00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:56.590
Standing outside her window.

00:07:56.590 --> 00:07:59.040
That was the guy who Dana saw last night.

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:01.220
He had been standing there, watching them.

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:02.740
Since last night.

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:07.440
and then we see where Steward is calling from:
It looks like a giant complex built underground

00:08:07.449 --> 00:08:10.060
like a bunker or a secret military base

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:12.550
Meanwhile, Arthur is at the police station

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:15.300
talking with his father-in-law who is a policeman.

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:18.480
He tells Arthur that Steward’s license plates

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:19.600
are used by government agents.

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:23.000
Steward’s license plates are used by 
NSA agents, in fact.

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:27.259
And then Arthur notices photos on the desk
Photos of the murdered wife.

00:08:27.259 --> 00:08:29.030
It’s all coming together.

00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:32.766
His father-in-law (the police officer) is really casual about it

00:08:32.766 --> 00:08:35.360
Telling him the details: she was shot to death;

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:38.680
No signs of a struggle, and that her husband worked at, NASA.

00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:44.570
Then the he tells Arthur that The gunshots
were heard sometime around 4:40 PM and Arthur

00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:47.710
then has an idea of why she died.

00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:50.070
and he asks if he can look at the crime scene

00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:54.420
Meanwhile, Norma is shopping with her mother
When suddenly this woman comes to her and

00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:56.870
She says “The NSA is letting him do
it.

00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:58.360
NASA can’t stop it.

00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:00.880
All test subjects are under the age of 40.

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:03.000
Happily married with a single child.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.240
Go to the Richmond Public Library and follow
this call number.

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:07.780
Don’t trust anyone.

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:09.280
Not even your husband.”

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:13.000
The woman collapses in Norma’s arms, and
the woman gets a nosebleed.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.820
Norma decides to go to the library to see
what that woman wanted her to see.

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:19.880
At the crime scene, Arthur sees a desk

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:21.480
on it is a photo of Arlington Steward,

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:24.070
before his accident with his wife, Clymene.

00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:25.840
And there are other things on the desk like

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:29.860
this polaroid photo of the Human Resource Exploitation Manual.

00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:31.280
There are numbers on it’s rim.

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:33.780
These are library call numbers for books.

00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:38.420
Those numbers on the spine of books, that
help you find out where they are in a library.

00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:42.860
So, Arthur sneaks the photo out and goes to
the library to check out the call number.

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:46.380
Norma is there now, and she’s looking for
her call number.

00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:47.780
When she sees Arthur.

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:50.980
She remembers what that woman said “Don’t
trust anyone.

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:52.320
Not even your husband”

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:54.570
She hides from him
and goes downstairs.

00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:57.380
Arthur doesn’t know she’s here but he
finds a book.

00:09:57.380 --> 00:10:00.980
But somewhere in the library, a group of guys suddenly turn.

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:03.160
The book Arthur found is called The Lightning
book.

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:07.760
Inside is a newspaper clipping reading “NASA employee
struck by lightning”.

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:12.020
Downstairs, Norma finds what she is looking for, a film reel.

00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:13.340
She takes it out and plays it.

00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:16.680
Upstairs, Arthur leaves the book and on his
way out.

00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:19.030
Comes face to face with that group of guys
from earlier who follow him.

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:20.750
He runs away and they follow him.

00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:21.750
It’s seriously creepy.

00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:22.750
They don’t even talk.

00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:25.420
Downstairs, the film reel shows a building.

00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:26.420
A NASA building.

00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:28.460
It looks like a place to put airplanes in and

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:30.800
we see scorch marks on the building and tarmac.

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:34.160
Arthur is still running away when he enters
this big room.

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:37.280
As he gets closer and closer, to what he thinks
is the exit.

00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:39.110
The people there turn to look at him.

00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:43.540
He asks the librarian for directions and he
realizes he knows her

00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:44.320
From the photo!

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:47.140
That’s Arlington Steward’s wife : Clymene
Steward.

00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:51.700
Norma continunes watching the film and sees:
Arlington Steward.

00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:56.010
Before his accident looking into the camera.

00:10:56.010 --> 00:10:59.480
Arthur asks Steward’s Wife, Clymene “Why
is he testing us?”

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:02.600
and she answers “He’s testing us, all of us."

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:05.300
And then she asks him to follow her to a side
room.

00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:09.260
there she tells him that there are 3 gateways, but
he must be careful

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.060
There is only 1 path to salvation

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:13.260
Whatever that means, it doesn’t sound safe.

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.180
ander nose starts to bleed

00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:19.080
as she holds her hand out and below, 3 floor tiles open up.

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:21.480
and from them come these weird pillars of water.

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:25.240
Norma is trying to get out of library, but
she is taken to meet Steward.

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:29.600
Steward tells Norma that he was struck by
lightning, and now he can talk with the people

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:30.880
who control the lightning.

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:34.340
Arthur asks what happens if he chooses wrong
or if he doesn’t choose at all.

00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:35.980
Eternal Damnation.

00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:38.320
So Arthur chooses Gateway 2.

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:42.430
Okay so, to clear up a few things: why did Arthur choose Gateway 2?

00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:47.760
Well, if you remember the kids from earlier: the creepy kid from Norma's class and the valet

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:52.800
All did this. They all stuck up 2 fingers and Arthur realizes this

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:58.000
and choose it because of that and you even see him hold up 2 fingers in the scene

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.340
Steward asks Norma what she felt when she
saw Steward’s face.

00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:03.806
She tells him that she felt ‘love’ for him

00:12:03.806 --> 00:12:05.920
She knows his pain since she has her

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:07.360
own foot that is messed up.

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:11.060
Steward seems pleased with her answer and
asks her to take his hand.

00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:14.000
And as soon as she does she blacks out.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.690
Meanwhile, Arthur goes through the gate and
he’s taken into a tunnel of purest white

00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:20.740
Like something from another world.

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:22.260
Then Norma wakes up.

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.430
She’s on her bed at home, and Arthur’s
there!

00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:26.620
In a water box that’s floating above her.

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:30.060
Arthur collapses onto the bed

00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:31.320
with the water flowing out of the room.

00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:36.260
He’s alive but wet and water is everywhere.

00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:38.080
So they have to clean it up.

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:41.570
Walter helps them out but he asks them if
they remembered how they got home.

00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:42.649
Their silence is telling.

00:12:42.649 --> 00:12:44.200
So he tells them what happened:

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:46.010
They came
home in the car.

00:12:46.010 --> 00:12:48.899
They walked in like zombies and collapsed
on the bed.

00:12:48.899 --> 00:12:50.680
Arthur and Norma don’t know what to say.

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:51.740
As they try to clean up

00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:55.000
Arthur’s boss and the NSA head Martin talk.

00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:59.440
Where Martin tells Arthur’s boss that Mr.
Steward was struck by lightning,

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:02.360
at the same place they are standing at right now.

00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:05.360
Steward was declared dead and put into the
morgue.

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:11.280
Where he came back to life and it was discovered
that he could heal very, very fast.

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:16.000
As they talk, Steward listens in on their
conversation, in his underground base.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.860
Later the Lewis's go to a wedding, where Arthur feels unease

00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:22.920
and without his notice is being watched by a man through a window.

00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:28.060
In Steward's secret base briefcases and Boxes are being prepared. Steward is asked by Martin

00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:30.680
“How can people pass the test and when will this all end?

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:31.920
His answer is simple:

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:34.980
The only way to pass the test is to not press the button

00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:39.220
Back at the wedding, Norma and Arthur have a talk and Arthur describes seeing a light

00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:44.840
The way he describes it seems like he went to Heaven, a perfect paradise beyond time and space

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:46.600
Arthur feels sick after dancing and

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:49.020
goes outside for fresh air only to be held up

00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:52.940
at gunpoint by Jeff Carnes, the guy who
got that phone call earlier.

00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:55.980
Jeff takes him on a car ride and together
they leave.

00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:58.527
At the same time Walter walks out looking
for Arthur.

00:13:58.527 --> 00:14:02.440
Norma follows him outside and then both her and Walter

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:03.720
get kidnapped.

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:08.700
Jeff shows Arthur classified CIA documents
about the Human Resource Exploitation Manual,

00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:12.180
about the gateways, and tells him that something
not human.

00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:15.390
Has put something into the brains of humans,
to control them.

00:14:15.390 --> 00:14:17.730
Which causes these people to bleed from their
nose.

00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:21.839
Meanwhile at the motel swimming pool, we see
Norma taken into the pool.

00:14:21.839 --> 00:14:24.040
To be judged whether she is good or bad.

00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:29.170
Jeff then tells Arthur that the reason why
he had to kill his wife was because of a decision:

00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:31.830
it was either kill his daughter or his wife.

00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:36.310
They stop as a mind-controlled Santa stands
in their way and they are run into by a truck.

00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:39.779
Jeff dies and Arthur is taken somewhere by
someone.

00:14:39.779 --> 00:14:44.250
Meanwhile at the Langley Research Center,
the NSA Chief Martin and Arthur’s boss oversee

00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:45.650
an operation.

00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:48.460
Soldiers wait with guns ready to shoot, as
the doors open.

00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:51.290
From the inside, Arthur walks out and collapses.

00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:53.850
He is taken by them back to his home with
Norma and there.

00:14:53.850 --> 00:14:55.420
At home, they meet Steward.

00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:57.310
Who is sorry about everything that has happened.

00:14:57.310 --> 00:15:00.590
And he tells them that Walter has become deaf
and blind.

00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:02.170
No human medicine can heal him.

00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:04.330
Only one thing can and that is a choice.

00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:07.959
1) Live the rest of your lives together with Walter, who will

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:11.300
forever be blind and deaf but you will have
1 million dollars;

00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:14.460
or 2) Kill your wife with this gun and when she dies

00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:17.140
Walter will be able to see and hear again.

00:15:17.149 --> 00:15:21.149
If they do, Walter will get the money but
it will be put into an account he can only

00:15:21.149 --> 00:15:22.890
access when he’s 18.

00:15:22.890 --> 00:15:27.190
There are no other options and we see Walter
figure out that he’s blind and deaf.

00:15:27.190 --> 00:15:31.350
Arthur puts the gun to Steward’s head but
Steward tells him that it won’t do much.

00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:35.290
Since Arthur will go to jail for murder and
Steward will get a replacement.

00:15:35.290 --> 00:15:39.120
Before he leaves, Steward tells them that
Walter is locked in the bathroom and they

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:40.700
try to open the bathroom door.

00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:44.130
But now they have a choice: save Walter or
let him suffer.

00:15:44.130 --> 00:15:46.760
They come to a decision, and say their goodbyes.

00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:49.480
We see another couple with a Box of their
own.

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:53.900
and as they press the button *Norma dies*

00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:55.900
The police are called and Mr. Steward arrives.

00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:58.700
To the home of the other couple
 with a briefcase full of money.

00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:01.050
"Shall I come in?"

00:16:01.050 --> 00:16:05.740
The police arrive and arrest Arthur and he
is taken away by the NSA while Walter is left

00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:06.740
behind.

00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:10.120
The movie ends with Mr. Steward leaving the
home with the box in hand.

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:11.510
The cycle continues.

00:16:11.510 --> 00:16:12.899
Who knows when it will end.

00:16:12.899 --> 00:16:14.010
So what just happened?

00:16:14.010 --> 00:16:15.010
Aliens!

00:16:15.010 --> 00:16:16.540
Yeah, like 'real life' aliens!

00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:19.220
and we know this because of hints throughout the film

00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:24.100
Like radio broadcasts talking about space
stuff or Mr. Stewart coming back to life after

00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:27.060
being struck by lighting and of course, Walter!

00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:29.941
Who at the end of movie can't see or hear.

00:16:29.941 --> 00:16:32.880
But suddenly is able to after his mom dies?

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:34.680
How would you explain it?

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:36.660
Super advanced alien technology.

00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:38.720
Now I did say I would explain the nose bleeds

00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:41.020
The aliens are operating on people, they're cutting open

00:16:41.029 --> 00:16:44.370
people’s heads, and putting something inside
their heads.

00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:46.089
To control the minds and bodies of people

00:16:46.089 --> 00:16:51.399
Now the surgery isn’t perfect, so sometimes,
people bleed from the nose.

00:16:51.399 --> 00:16:52.654
And if that isn't enough then my

00:16:52.654 --> 00:16:54.380
favourite clue in the movie is when

00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:56.110
Norma and Arthur get back from the library

00:16:56.110 --> 00:16:58.260
They don’t remember how they got there (home)

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:00.160
This is an experience known as

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:00.780
“Missing Time”

00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:03.700
which usually happens after being abducted by aliens.

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:05.900
What happens is you have gaps in your memory and you

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:09.380
can't remember what happened to you or how you got somewhere.

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:10.000
With that being said

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.360
Thank you so much for watching, ladies and
gentlemen.
