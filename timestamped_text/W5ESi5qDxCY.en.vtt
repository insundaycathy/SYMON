00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.200
Welcome back to Movie Recaps.

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:07.880
Today I will show you a sci-fi, romance, drama
film from 2016, titled Passengers.

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:08.930
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:10.780
Watch out and take care.

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:15.070
The interstellar spaceship Avalon can be seen
travelling through space, headed to a colonized

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:17.039
world called Homestead 2.

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.130
All of its quarters are empty, the vessel
is on autopilot.

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.259
The 258 crewmembers as well as the 5000 passengers
are in hibernation.

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:30.329
Suddenly, the ship passes through an asteroid
belt, that's weakening its shields.

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:34.270
Power is diverted to the main shield, but
the ship is on a collision course with a giant

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:35.270
asteroid.

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.940
Suddenly, the asteroid collides with the ship,
causing various malfunctions.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.350
The ship begins self-reparations, but one
of the hibernation pods activates.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.140
The passenger awakened is Jim Preston, a mechanical
engineer.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.050
His pod opens and an automated system helps
with his awakening, telling him that he's

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.120
spent 120 years in suspended animation and
that the ship is only 4 months away from Homestead

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.120
2.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.760
He's told that he will be able to spend that
time enjoying the luxurious aspects of the

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:02.760
ship.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.049
Jim receives instructions about his ID band,
his cabin and the primary activities he's

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.630
to take part off, prior to the arrival on
the planet.

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.469
Excited and nervous to meet the people on
the ship, he gets ready, leaves his cabin

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:18.359
and walks into an automated class meant for
an entire learning group.

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:22.680
Jim looks a little anxious, as the hologram
explains the situation on Earth, calling it

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.799
overpopulated, overpriced and overrated.

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.740
It tells him to hold his questions to the
end of the lesson, but Jim keeps asking why

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.369
he's the only one there.

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:35.750
He realizes that the hologram can't answer
him and goes to search for other people.

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.060
He gets to the main concourse of the ship.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.399
No one is there either, but an automated informational
desk offers to help.

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:46.399
Jim asks to talk to a real person and it sends
him off to talk to a steward, but when he

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:50.130
finds that no one is there too, he asks to
speak to the captain.

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.100
When he gets to the bridge, even though he
doesn't have access to go inside, he can see

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.689
that none of the main crew is awake either.

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:00.840
Jim eventually goes to the observatory, where
he finds out that the ship is actually 90

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.759
years away from Homestead 2.

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.229
He realizes that he woke up to soon, so he
rushes back to the concourse and sends a message

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.959
back to Earth asking what he should do, because
he doesn't know how to get back into hibernation.

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:16.230
The communications system informs him that
the overpriced call to Earth would take approximately

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.650
55 years to get an answer back.

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.120
Jim is devastated.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.090
He walks around and finds the ships bar, where
he sees another person.

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.540
As he's talking to the bartender something
seems strange about him.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.209
When he goes to get him a drink, Jim realizes
that he's an android.

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:32.659
It's called Arthur.

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:36.689
Jim wants to find out more information from
him, but he can't even explain to the android

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:39.350
how it's possible for him to be there ahead
of time.

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:43.510
Jim wakes up in his cabin the next day and
goes to the cantina, where he quickly realizes

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.829
that most of the things on the menu are reserved
for gold class passengers only.

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:52.220
He gets his plain coffee and tries to figure
out how to fix his hibernation chamber.

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.370
After he gets all the tools, he manages to
get it operating and lies down inside of the

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:57.370
pod.

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:58.530
But nothing happens.

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.450
Next, he decides to use the tools he found
to get into the crew's hibernation chambers.

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:04.860
That doesn't work either.

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.560
Small malfunctions happen around the ship.

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.390
Jim keeps returning to the bar to drink, but
mostly to talk to Arthur.

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.689
The android gives him some advice, that convinces
him to brake into one of the gold class rooms

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:18.069
and try to have some fun on the ship.

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:22.000
Jim tries all the restaurants, the games,
the entertainment system.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.049
But as time passes he becomes even more miserable
to be there alone.

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:30.159
One day, he gets drunk and wanders around
the hibernation pods, when he stumbles into

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:33.480
an airlock with spacesuits designed for spacewalks.

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.319
Jim gets into a suit and goes to the airlock,
pushes a lever and then the button to release

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:38.900
the airlock door.

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.790
Once outside the ship he's mesmerized by the
view.

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.530
He's the only conscious human being experiencing
that moment in time.

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:50.019
Jim releases the magnets on his boots and
floats in space, feeling devastated.

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:55.030
He comes back inside, takes off the suit,
but goes back to the airlock without it on.

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.499
He pulls the lever, ready to end it all, but
changes his mind in the last moment, runs

00:03:59.499 --> 00:04:02.000
back inside and slips on a bottle.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.879
Jim stands up and is instantly drawn to a
woman in one of the pods, named Aurora.

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:10.849
He searches for her files in the directory
and listens to her passenger interview, becoming

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:12.390
enamored with her.

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:16.340
Later his seen sitting next to her pod, still
listening to her interviews.

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:20.829
Back in the bar, he's reading some of her
work and is talking to Arthur about her writing.

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:25.080
He becomes obsessed with the irony of his
situation, going to another planet for a better

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.550
life, waking up early and not getting there,
and finding his perfect woman, only for her

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.120
to be out of reach.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.889
Jim keeps thinking about her and starts getting
the idea to wake her up too.

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:38.750
He talks it over with the android, but he
doesn't understand the conundrum.

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.430
If he wakes her up for his own benefit, he'd
be stranding her there with him, to die on

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:43.600
the ship.

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.560
Jim decides against it first, but as time
goes by he can't let it go.

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.060
Until one day, he changes his mind.

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.840
He goes to her pod and manages to activate
it.

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.750
As she's waking up and going through the same
process as he did, he hides and goes back

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:57.750
to his room.

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:01.830
A little bit later he goes to the main concourse,
hoping to find her.

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.280
And there she is, just as confused as he was
a year ago.

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.389
Jim tells her they're the only ones awake
and takes her to the observatory.

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:13.479
Then he tells her that he can't get to neither
the crew, nor the main commands of the ship.

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:16.330
Aurora freaks out and wants to get back into
her pod.

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.930
When they get to it, Jim explains that there
is no special equipment on the ship that can

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:24.160
help them get back into hibernation, effectively
telling her that they're stranded.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.910
They go back at the concourse and he tells
her that she should rest, since she just came

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:29.539
out of hibernation.

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:33.569
She feels sorry for him, having to spend more
than a year alone on the ship.

00:05:33.569 --> 00:05:37.190
Jim goes back to the bar, feeling regretful
about what he did.

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:41.039
He asks Arthur not to tell Aurora that he
was the one that woke her up.

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:43.370
The next day, Aurora wakes up.

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:47.220
She goes back to the concourse and asks the
automated info desk about the hibernation

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:48.410
pods.

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:51.000
Jim joins her there and they go to get breakfast.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.660
As they leave, the info desk has some sort
of malfunction.

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:59.080
In the cantina, Aurora realizes that Jim has
been eating the same breakfast for more then

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.860
a year and gets him one of the gold class
menus.

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:06.740
They talk about the possibility to fix the
pods, but, unlike Jim, Aurora isn't ready

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:07.960
to give up.

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:12.199
She searches through the infirmary, then goes
through research documents, eventually ending

00:06:12.199 --> 00:06:15.910
up at the crew's hibernation quarters trying
to break the doors open.

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:18.819
Jim notices more malfunctions throughout the
ship.

00:06:18.819 --> 00:06:22.370
Some time later, Aurora laments about her
life on the Avalon.

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:26.430
She writes, jogs around the ship and swims
in the pool, becoming more and more aware

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:28.110
of her situation.

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:32.669
She goes to the cantina to interview Jim,
thinking that his story might be interesting.

00:06:32.669 --> 00:06:35.379
She asks why he immigrated to the colony.

00:06:35.379 --> 00:06:39.180
Jim answers with slogans from the company
first, but then further explains that he hopes

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:42.140
that on the new world he could be somebody,
he could build a life.

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:47.610
Later, they end up in the observatory and
Aurora finally shares her reason to be there.

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:51.090
Unlike the other passengers on the ship, she
has a round trip ticket.

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:55.380
Her idea was to go to Homestead 2, live there
for a year and come back to Earth, to become

00:06:55.380 --> 00:07:00.009
the first journalist that has ever done that,
writing the greatest story that ever was.

00:07:00.009 --> 00:07:03.710
Aurora slowly gives up on finding a way to
fix their current predicament and Jim figures

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:05.509
out a way to cheer her up.

00:07:05.509 --> 00:07:09.280
He takes her dancing, to the cinema, and to
the basketball court.

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:12.280
Lastly, he takes her to the bar to meet Arthur.

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:15.949
She relaxes for a bit, until she remembers
their situation.

00:07:15.949 --> 00:07:19.660
Jim is left alone with the android, feeling
awful about what he's done to her.

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:24.100
The next moment he's seen tinkering with something
and in the other Aurora walks into the observatory

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:27.340
to find a miniature of the Chrysler building
he made for her.

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:30.159
Some time later, they go on a date at the
bar.

00:07:30.159 --> 00:07:33.069
They have diner and share stories about their
lives.

00:07:33.069 --> 00:07:35.750
She tells him that her father died when she
was a teenager.

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:40.770
After the dinner, Jim takes Aurora to the
airlock and they get into the spacesuits.

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:43.120
They go out for a spacewalk together.

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:46.820
Jim finally has someone to share that magnificent
experience with.

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:50.620
Jim switches off the magnets on their boots
and they float together in space.

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:55.349
They come back inside and immediately kiss,
retreat to his cabin and sleep together.

00:07:55.349 --> 00:07:58.199
Soon after, they start living like a couple.

00:07:58.199 --> 00:08:01.360
Aurora moves into his cabin and writes about
her life on the ship.

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:04.780
They jog together, eat together, sleep together.

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:08.169
Jim explores the ship further and finds the
hydroponics bay.

00:08:08.169 --> 00:08:10.130
He brings Aurora flowers.

00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:14.379
One day the ship passes by a red giant and
they go to the observatory to see it.

00:08:14.379 --> 00:08:18.490
It's Aurora's birthday, so later that night
they celebrate it in one of the many restaurants

00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:20.370
on the ship and then the bar.

00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:24.330
Jim goes to the washroom and prepares the
ring he made for Aurora, while she stays in

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:26.150
the bar chatting with Arthur.

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:29.979
The android tells Aurora that Jim woke her
up intentionally, unaware that he was still

00:08:29.979 --> 00:08:31.530
to keep that a secret.

00:08:31.530 --> 00:08:36.089
Suddenly, Jim comes back and she confronts
him in absolute disbelief.

00:08:36.089 --> 00:08:38.320
She runs away furious and panicked.

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:41.390
Jim comes back to his cabin to find all her
things gone.

00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:46.510
He runs into her in the cantina the next day,
but the moment he speaks, she runs away.

00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:47.920
Aurora is desperate.

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:52.740
One night she goes over to Jim's cabin, punching
and kicking him, wanting to kill him.

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:57.170
Talking to her over the com because she keeps
avoiding him, Jim tries to apologize and explain

00:08:57.170 --> 00:08:58.770
his actions to her.

00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:02.230
He tells her he fell in love with her, but
Aurora doesn't care.

00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:04.860
She can't forgive him for taking her life.

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:08.850
One night, as Jim is in his cabin, another
malfunction happens.

00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:12.190
The ship faces a critical error and the main
command shuts down.

00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:16.010
Later, he walks into the elevator and it malfunctions.

00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:19.980
Aurora walks into the main concourse and sees
that Jim has planted a tree there.

00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:24.700
Then, she goes to the cantina, where the food
dispensary is also malfunctioning.

00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:28.839
Suddenly, both of them hear the voice of the
deck chief over the coms, asking who planted

00:09:28.839 --> 00:09:29.930
the tree.

00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:34.200
They both run into the concourse and see Gus
Mancuso standing in front of Jim's tree.

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:37.630
They introduce themselves and tell the chief
about the situation.

00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:40.329
He doesn't understand how 3 pods could fail.

00:09:40.329 --> 00:09:44.450
Mancuso takes them to the bridge and he discovers
that there is something wrong with the ship,

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:47.670
but the information on the systems has to
be checked manually.

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:51.130
When they leave the bridge a robot almost
falls on their heads and the two of them tell

00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:55.279
Mancuso that malfunctions have been happening
all over the ship more frequently.

00:09:55.279 --> 00:09:58.950
He says that shouldn't happen, as he shows
them how to collect the data.

00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:02.459
Mancuso checks on the pods, when Jim joins
him there.

00:10:02.459 --> 00:10:05.170
He's figured out what happened with Aurora's
pod.

00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:07.760
The deck chief finds what Jim did to be terrible.

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:12.490
Later, he's at the bridge checking the collected
data, when Aurora joins him.

00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:15.950
They talk about what happened with her pod,
but he tells her that he can't do anything

00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:17.100
about it.

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:20.190
Jim walks in with the 16th broken robot.

00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:24.670
Mancuso feels the hibernation sickness, so
he goes to rest, but as he walks out, he coughs

00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:25.930
out blood.

00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:29.510
That night, Aurora can't sleep, so she goes
for a swim.

00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:32.790
Suddenly there's gravity loss throughout the
ship and she starts drowning as the water

00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:34.570
from the pool moves with her.

00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:38.070
The gravity drive resets and she barely makes
it out alive.

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:41.060
They both run into each other going to find
Mancuso.

00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:44.529
The three of them are back at the bridge,
slowly discovering what has been going on

00:10:44.529 --> 00:10:45.790
with the ship.

00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:50.620
Mancuso figures out that something happened
2 years ago, taking out a major system.

00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:54.360
They need to find and fix what has caused
the failure, because the entire ship is trying

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:55.940
to pick up the slack.

00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:59.100
If they don't fix it, the entire vessel will
be stranded.

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:04.680
They go to find the problem, but Mancuso faints,
so Jim and Aurora take him to the infirmary.

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:09.290
He's dying and there are no treatments that
can stop it or prolong the time he has left.

00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:13.589
Some time later, the three of them meet in
the observatory and Mancuso gives Jim his

00:11:13.589 --> 00:11:17.329
ID bracelet, tells them to fix the ship and
immediately perishes.

00:11:17.329 --> 00:11:22.020
Suddenly, the lights change to an alarming
red and the ship starts shaking.

00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:26.089
Jim tells Aurora that he needs her help and
they run toward engineering, but there's another

00:11:26.089 --> 00:11:28.220
failure in the gravity drive.

00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:31.529
And immediatelly another one that afflicts
Arthur as well.

00:11:31.529 --> 00:11:33.089
Jim deactivates him.

00:11:33.089 --> 00:11:36.600
They finally arrive in engineering and start
looking for the problem.

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:41.120
The find it in the power plant and as they
open the hatch, Aurora gets sucked in.

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:44.350
The asteroid has caused a breach in the hull
in that area.

00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:49.230
Jim gets sucked in too, but he holds on to
the hatch, as it keeps closing on him.

00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:53.320
Eventually he gets sucked in too, but they
quickly manage to seal the breach.

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:57.220
Instantly after fixing that problem, Jim realizes
that there is more than one breach in the

00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:58.220
hull.

00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:01.890
The two of them follow the trajectory of the
meteor and find that it has hit the reactor

00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:03.510
control computer.

00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:06.170
Jim thinks he can find replacement parts for
it.

00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:10.690
They find the part and change it, but the
process of venting the reactor still fails.

00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:13.160
They do it manually, but it fails again.

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:16.800
Jim figures out that he needs to open the
vent door from outside of the ship, so they

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:18.750
can cool the reactor down.

00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:22.829
Both of them go to the airlock and as he's
getting ready to go out, he gives Aurora Mancuso's

00:12:22.829 --> 00:12:25.430
bracelet, because he might not come back.

00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:28.949
She helps him with the suit and as he walks
into the airlock she tells him to come back

00:12:28.949 --> 00:12:31.720
because she can't live on the ship without
him.

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:35.570
Aurora goes back to the reactor, where the
temperature has hit critical heights.

00:12:35.570 --> 00:12:39.880
A bolt from the reactor propels into her arm,
as Jim is getting closer to the vent from

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:41.910
the outside and sees the door.

00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:45.780
The temperature rises in the reactor room,
while he is trying to bypass the vent door

00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:46.980
to open it.

00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:51.070
He soon realizes that he'll have to manually
hold the door open so the reactor can vent

00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:52.709
and he tells Aurora.

00:12:52.709 --> 00:12:57.070
She doesn't like the plan, but he goes ahead
with it and tells her to vent the reactor.

00:12:57.070 --> 00:13:00.380
She doesn't want him to die and they argue,
but he tells her that they have to save the

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:02.779
other people and she vents the reactor.

00:13:02.779 --> 00:13:07.889
The process is successful, but the fumes from
the reactor push Jim away and break his tether.

00:13:07.889 --> 00:13:10.180
The pressure in his suit is dropping too.

00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:14.060
He tells Aurora what happened and she moves
as fast as she can to get to another suit

00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:15.420
and bring him in.

00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:17.600
He apologizes to her again.

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:21.600
She puts on a suit and flies out to get him,
but her tether is too short.

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:25.810
She's pulled back, but suddenly grabs onto
his tether and manages to pull him in.

00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:30.320
Aurora drags Jim into the infirmary, only
to find out that he's already dead.

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:35.260
She uses Mancuso's bracelet to override the
medical protocols and to resuscitate him.

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:38.820
The medical pod does the work automatically
and revives Jim.

00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:40.240
Aurora forgives him.

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:44.269
Later, Aurora fixes Arthur and they give Mancuso
a proper space burial.

00:13:44.269 --> 00:13:48.670
Jim takes her to the infirmary and tells her
that he's found a way to use the medical pod

00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:50.339
as a hibernation one.

00:13:50.339 --> 00:13:53.980
He tells her to get inside the pod and ride
out the rest of the journey in there.

00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:59.570
But, as is later revealed, she declines and
decides to stay with him, awake on the ship.

00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:03.040
Jim finally proposes to her and they live
out their lives on the ship.

00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:06.910
88 years later, the Avalon arrives on Homestead
2.

00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:10.820
The crew wakes up and finds the ship in a
very unexpected state.

00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:20.420
Aurora leaves them a message, retelling the
story of the life her and Jim had on the ship

00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:22.170
while the rest were sleeping.
