00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.040
Welcome to the breakdown where we breakdown
all the messed up movies!

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:14.049
Here it is, the House that Jack Built directed
by Lars Von Trier!

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:18.820
Also the director of Antichrist, a film that
is pretty classic in terms of being a well

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:24.220
known disturbing film!

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:29.980
The House that Jack Built is right up there,
showing a serial killer named Jack kill many

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.770
victims over the course of 12 years!

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:38.750
All the while, Jack is conversation with some
unseen figure named Verge, who basically makes

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.290
Jack look like a pretentious sicko.

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.020
Now before we get into the video, we do have
a word from our wonderful sponsor!

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:46.920

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.060
Like?

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:01.220
You know what suitcases share in common with
those wallets you have in your back pockets?

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.580
They both can get over-packed, they both can
get lost, and they both heavy as hell.

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.310
Right so back to The House that Jack Built.

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:20.400
He's invited us in.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.810
If you want to see what happens, including
all the messed up parts, stay tuned for the

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.540
breakdown!

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.330
Cue the GOHAN!

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.590
The movie starts off.....naw I just had to
say that for old times sake.

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.940
Throughout this entire film, the main character
Jack is having a conversation with an unseen

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.790
figure named Verge.

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.970
You'll get more context later but, they have
a very philosophical like conversation based

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.810
on Jacks ideals and crimes.

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:57.010
More likely then not though, Verge will often
sarcastically or bluntly disagree with Jack's

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.280
delusional thoughts.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.840
Lets get into it now, it's the first incident.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:07.519
Jack is riding around when a woman, the deadliest
woman in the world flags him down.

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:08.720
She needs a...Jack, her car broke down.

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:09.849
She need to get it fixed cuz she gotta go
Kill Bill.

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:13.819
Jack is very reluctant to help because he
wants to just go about his business but he

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:18.709
eventually agrees painfully to drive her to
Sonny's, a local blacksmith.

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:23.900
She's a very sardonic lady and jokes around
saying Jack looks like a serial killer.

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.239
She even tells him how she should kill her
and bury him.

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:31.120
Kind of rude to joke around like that but
its apart of her charm.

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.349
Despite fixing the jack, it breaks again when
they try to use it and she cries for him to

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:37.310
drive her back to Sonny's.

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.239
She's like I'm sorry about saying you're a
serial killer.

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:42.510
You're too much of a wimp to be one.

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.190
That didn't go well for Jack, and he kills
her with the Jack.

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:51.349
Its then that we get into more introspection
between Jack and Verge.

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:56.190
Jack often compares his murdering to art..Like
what serial killer doesn't now.

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:01.269
He owns a walk-in freezer where he has some
privacy and puts the woman's body inside.

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:06.209
He attempts to hide the ladies car despite
it being noticeable from the road, but sees

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:11.319
it as a stroke of genius because its out of
police jurisdiction at this point so no officers

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:13.040
will see it anyway.

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:18.810
So Jack often compares his murder to art,
and Verge isn't listening out of anything

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:19.930
more than interest.

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:24.879
He already has a dead set opinion that Jack
is a lunatic to put things short.

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:27.240
Here is the second incident.

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.210
All five happen over the course of 12 years.

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.879
Jack is watching an old lady walk home.

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:38.490
Dressed professional, he attempts to open
the door first but sees its locked.

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:43.759
He rings the doorbell and once she opens,
Jack awkwardly tells her he is the police.

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:47.379
Its like a sitcom how much he fumbles around.

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:52.449
She asks to see a badge though, something
he terribly explains away.

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:57.720
After seeing her past husband's memorial he
digs up a story saying he's really an insurance

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.639
agent who can increase her pension.

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:05.129
He said all that about being a police officer
was what they tell him to say when he knocks

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:07.840
on doors to tests the homeowners.

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:12.550
She's still kind of doubtful but if he can
increase her pension then she'll let him in.

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:17.090
Once inside he rambles on about having to
stand outside for so long.

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:21.879
She's on edge a bit too cuz she really wants
more money but apart of me thinks she knows

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:22.879
she messed up.

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:27.620
And mess up she did, and she is unsuccessful
strangled by Jack.

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:29.930
He has bad luck in strangling her.

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:34.899
She doesn't die right away so he makes her
drink water with donuts so she can choke.

00:05:34.899 --> 00:05:40.110
She doesn't choke though and so he just strangles
her again and stabs her in the chest..ending

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:42.569
her painful grasps of air.

00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:47.120
He takes pictures of her body before backing
up the van to put her inside.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:51.529
He then covers up his tracks and makes sure
everything is clean.

00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:57.629
See Jack has OCD, and cant stop the need to
go back in to clean up the place spotless.

00:05:57.629 --> 00:06:01.069
He imagines random blood stains that aren't
actually there.

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:02.159
His compulsions keep him going back inside
many times and recleaning.

00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:06.710
Soon he hears sirens in the distance and gets
in the car to race away.

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:11.330
Despite this, his compulsion tortures him
again even though police are coming.

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:16.470
Soon the police investigate the area after
having calls of a burglary, and an officer

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:18.740
discovers Jack in his van.

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:21.309
He hid the body before the officer came.

00:06:21.309 --> 00:06:26.879
In the midst of a burlary investigation, Jack
uses it to pain the story that he is an old

00:06:26.879 --> 00:06:29.789
friend of Claire the lady he killed.

00:06:29.789 --> 00:06:35.210
According to Jack, he says he's been waiting
for 2 hours for Claire but no answer came

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:36.539
from knocking.

00:06:36.539 --> 00:06:41.870
Jack is very eccentric, but I think it damn
near helps him get away from being suspected.

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:46.179
He ties the ladies body to his van while the
officer is inside.

00:06:46.179 --> 00:06:48.139
The officer told him to leave.

00:06:48.139 --> 00:06:53.349
He drives the van away dragging the woman
all the way back to his walk-in fridge building.

00:06:53.349 --> 00:06:57.099
It literally leads a blood trail all the way
to his building.

00:06:57.099 --> 00:07:02.630
Nature is on his side though because it so
happens to rain and wash away all the blood

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:03.630
trail.

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:06.060
The ladies body is basically destroyed too.

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:11.119
Jack knows he is a psychopath and usually
practices emotions in the mirror to fit in

00:07:11.119 --> 00:07:12.119
with others.

00:07:12.119 --> 00:07:13.119
Really Jack is getting the temptation to taunt
and see if he can be caught.

00:07:13.119 --> 00:07:14.119
He went through his entire life getting away
from trouble, as well as fitting the criteria

00:07:14.119 --> 00:07:15.119
of origins that serial killers have.

00:07:15.119 --> 00:07:16.119
Anyway, Jack kills some girlfriend of his
one day.

00:07:16.119 --> 00:07:20.139
She didn't know Jack was going to strangle
her and it's the result of practicing so much

00:07:20.139 --> 00:07:24.020
that he could strangle her to death so easily
compared to last time.

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:25.020
He puts her in his fridge room too.

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:28.169
Sometime later he decides to take better pictures
of the dead bodies.

00:07:28.169 --> 00:07:32.319
His compulsion to be clean and hidden dissolves.

00:07:32.319 --> 00:07:37.110
He begins making more rash decisions like
running over a random old lady.

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:42.999
He brings both bodies back to his apartment
even when someone could notice him easily.

00:07:42.999 --> 00:07:46.530
Some pictures he takes he sends to the local
newspapers.

00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:49.990
Its where he coins his own serial killer name,
Mr Sophistication.

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:52.020
So back to Jack and Verge and their conversations.

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:56.809
Sometime later they talk about family and
Jack lights up because family has to do with

00:07:56.809 --> 00:07:58.529
the third incident.

00:07:58.529 --> 00:08:00.819
This is kinda disturbing so beware.

00:08:00.819 --> 00:08:07.379
One day Jack has taken a current girlfriend
and her two kids George and Grumpy on a hunting

00:08:07.379 --> 00:08:08.379
lesson.

00:08:08.379 --> 00:08:11.929
Jack makes sure to pain a narrative that he
doesn't like killing animals unless its ethical.

00:08:11.929 --> 00:08:15.550
He speaks so passionately about the activity
of hunting.

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:19.899
When its showing random clips that relate,
it means he is rambling and showing off his

00:08:19.899 --> 00:08:21.659
knowledge of everything.

00:08:21.659 --> 00:08:26.429
Anyway Jack helps George here shoot at a target
but things turn quickly.

00:08:26.429 --> 00:08:30.029
Firstly, Jack explains the right way to kill
a deer.

00:08:30.029 --> 00:08:33.740
Aim for the young, since a mother could live
without her young.

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:36.560
The young couldn't live without a mother.

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:41.099
So now that we know this, expect Jack to be
killing young.

00:08:41.099 --> 00:08:43.440
Randomly we see the family hiding.

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:47.810
Jack has probably scared them into hiding
from him but he is posted and ready to use

00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:48.810
his rifle.

00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:52.519
Grumpy is so scared he runs away from his
mother.

00:08:52.519 --> 00:08:54.319
You probably don't want to see this.

00:08:54.319 --> 00:08:58.450
I'm serious close your eyes if you don't want
to see children die.

00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:00.959
Grumpy has his whole leg shot in half.

00:09:00.959 --> 00:09:03.990
The mother's reaction is pretty hard to listen
to.

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:10.259
Once George pops out Jack shoots him in the
head too and the mother is left exposed and

00:09:10.259 --> 00:09:11.259
broken.

00:09:11.259 --> 00:09:16.930
Jack soon places both children on a picnic
mat and forces her to feed her two dead children

00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:18.269
some pie.

00:09:18.269 --> 00:09:20.440
This is an excellent day he says.

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:26.000
He asks what her favorite number is, 12, and
that's how long she has to run away before

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.319
being shot.

00:09:27.319 --> 00:09:28.810
She doesn't really run away though.

00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:34.079
I understand completely honestly I wouldn't
blame her if she didn't even leave the mat.

00:09:34.079 --> 00:09:36.329
Still she is shot and wounded.

00:09:36.329 --> 00:09:41.860
She crawls away a little bit but Jack shoots
her again and ceases her sporadic breathing.

00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:44.500
He then builds this little trophy parade.

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:45.740
Its not the worse part.

00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:48.610
Get ready for child mutilation.

00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:54.920
Jack uses wires and tools to change Grumpy's
face, and once rigor mortis sets in then he

00:09:54.920 --> 00:10:00.079
removes the wires and tools... revealing Grumpy's
twisted face.

00:10:00.079 --> 00:10:05.269
Imagine if Joker did this in the latest film
about him.Its something he would do and everybody

00:10:05.269 --> 00:10:06.310
would go nuts.

00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:08.079
The fourth incident.

00:10:08.079 --> 00:10:11.470
Jack uses a crutch on his way to a girlfriends
home.

00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:15.839
His girlfriend Jacqueline is insecure about
her relationship with Jack.

00:10:15.839 --> 00:10:21.721
He usually calls her Simple because he believes
she's stupid, but he admits to caring for

00:10:21.721 --> 00:10:23.060
her more than a psychopath should.

00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:24.180
She's not that slow, not everybody needs to
know where tigers are.

00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:25.180
He treats her cruel.

00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:30.720
She asks what he does for a living and he
puts it in simple, easy to understand terms.

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:31.720
He kills.

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:34.170
He's killed 60 people.

00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:36.120
Patrick Bateman admitted that too.

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:38.980
If someone admits that they are a serial killer,
step away.

00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:39.980
Jack thinks she has nice breasts.

00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:40.980
He uses a marker to circle around both like
an incision line.

00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:47.610
Smartly she nonchalantly escapes the room
telling a police officer stationed outside

00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:51.170
that her boyfriend is claiming to be a serial
killer and is weird.

00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:52.180
The officer thinks she's drunk though and
Jack saying this doesn't help.

00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:56.399
He played the drunk idiot and the police leaves
thinking it was just a drunk argument.

00:10:56.399 --> 00:10:57.579
She believes his fake drunk disposition and
forgives him.

00:10:57.579 --> 00:11:02.170
She's still a little suspicious I guess and
notices soon that she is locked inside her

00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:03.170
room.

00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:05.120
Not a big mystery on who locked it.

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:11.560
She noticed that he's not using his crutch
anymore, she don't seem so simple to me.

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:14.930
She even says that he must be Mr. Sophistication.

00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:17.860
The daring Jack tells her to scream for her
life.

00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:21.540
He even gives her some pointers.

00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:27.040
Jack lets her scream out the window but Jack's
point is he doesn't care about her and neither

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:28.480
does anybody else.

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:33.160
He ties her up and makes her choose which
knife he will use.

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:39.579
He cuts right into her breast and slashes
both off which we don't see all the way gladly.

00:11:39.579 --> 00:11:44.889
After she is dead he puts one of them on the
police officers windshield.

00:11:44.889 --> 00:11:50.480
Jack and Verge soon talk about how Jack sees
himself above his victims.

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:52.430
Above women specifically.

00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:59.440
He describes women as easier to use for art
but not because they might be smaller or whatever.

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:04.459
Again Verge questions all of Jack's egotistic
and pretentious speech.

00:12:04.459 --> 00:12:10.370
No matter what Jack says to justify his murders
as art, Verge will often disagree entirely.

00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:15.899
Jack also says something along the lines that
religion has turned humans into slaves who

00:12:15.899 --> 00:12:19.470
deny the savageness they have inside.

00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:22.589
Serial Killers also use these excuses.

00:12:22.589 --> 00:12:26.550
By the way, Jack made the other breast into
a wallet.

00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:28.470
The fifth incident.

00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:33.209
Jack has kidnapped a man to add to his row
of 5 people tied together.

00:12:33.209 --> 00:12:36.589
He's planning got shoot them all in the head
with one bullet.

00:12:36.589 --> 00:12:42.290
A Full metal jacket bullet can do that, but
his latest victim sees that Jack has the wrong

00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:43.290
bullet.

00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:45.730
Jack is itching to make this murder perfect.

00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:50.790
I'm sure he knows it might be his last and
he doesn't care about getting caught or dying.

00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:55.689
He locks his fridge room and goes to his local
gun place only to create a tantrum on the

00:12:55.689 --> 00:12:56.939
worker there.

00:12:56.939 --> 00:13:01.579
He can't exchange bullets because Jack has
no receipt or ID on him.

00:13:01.579 --> 00:13:05.459
After he leaves angrily the worker calls the
police.

00:13:05.459 --> 00:13:10.540
Jack goes to an old friend of his named SP
to get a full metal jacket.

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:14.819
SP here instead holds Jack so the police can
arrest him.

00:13:14.819 --> 00:13:19.200
Apparently the police are on to Jack about
a robbery he committed.

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:23.709
Jack uses their friendship as leverage to
manipulate him into putting the gun down,

00:13:23.709 --> 00:13:27.279
and then kills SP with a knife to the throat.

00:13:27.279 --> 00:13:32.769
He finds a single Full Metal Jacket bullet
and waits for the impending officer.

00:13:32.769 --> 00:13:38.459
He switched clothes with SP, using the trick
to shoot the police officer to death and steal

00:13:38.459 --> 00:13:39.529
his car.

00:13:39.529 --> 00:13:44.269
He drives all the way back to his walk-in
fridge building with the siren blaring.

00:13:44.269 --> 00:13:46.490
He wants the police to find him.

00:13:46.490 --> 00:13:50.069
Anyway he is ready to kill all five people
with one bullet.

00:13:50.069 --> 00:13:55.250
While aiming down the sights he notices its
too blurry which means he is too close.

00:13:55.250 --> 00:13:59.980
The only way to get distance is to open this
door behind him, a door he hasn't been able

00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:02.079
to open for 12 years.

00:14:02.079 --> 00:14:08.290
He succeeds into opening the door today though,
and once he opens the door, we are only seeing

00:14:08.290 --> 00:14:10.309
what is in Jack's mind.

00:14:10.309 --> 00:14:12.449
We are a guest in his head.

00:14:12.449 --> 00:14:17.639
He aims down at his victims and is ready to
shoot, until he hears a voice calling him

00:14:17.639 --> 00:14:18.709
in the back.

00:14:18.709 --> 00:14:22.850
Its Verge, our first time seeing him and Jack's
first time too.

00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:26.839
I guess all those conversations were after
this event.

00:14:26.839 --> 00:14:29.580
The police are right outside the building.

00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:33.060
Verge asks Jack "wasn't you going to build
a house?"

00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:37.459
All those attempts at building one on his
land was a failure in his eyes.

00:14:37.459 --> 00:14:42.190
Verge influences him to use the materials
he has inside the walk-in fridge.

00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:43.390
The dead bodies.

00:14:43.390 --> 00:14:48.560
It would definitely take hours to do this,
time Jack shouldn't have because the police

00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:51.970
were literally right outside before he started.

00:14:51.970 --> 00:14:57.410
The house isn't real, but regardless this
is The House that Jack Built.

00:14:57.410 --> 00:15:03.269
Verge leads Jack to follow him down a hole
inside the house, while the police are cutting

00:15:03.269 --> 00:15:04.949
through the building to get in.

00:15:04.949 --> 00:15:10.899
The police cut through and once they have
a whole in, a cop randomly aims his gun inside

00:15:10.899 --> 00:15:17.199
the fridge and shoots twice..Both hitting
Jack's house, but the second bullet hits right

00:15:17.199 --> 00:15:19.779
when Jack stumbles inside the hole.

00:15:19.779 --> 00:15:25.360
We are seeing Jack's delusions right now,
so its likely the police busted in and shot

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:27.100
and killed Jack.

00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:30.779
That's why he fell in so suddenly, like he
was shot.

00:15:30.779 --> 00:15:32.709
Where is this place though?

00:15:32.709 --> 00:15:36.139
You see Verge is actually a special guide.

00:15:36.139 --> 00:15:40.450
Around 600 years ago, Verge guided Dante through
the levels of hell.

00:15:40.450 --> 00:15:45.660
I haven't read the story in a while but this
scene is based on Dante's Inferno.

00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:51.089
Verge is short for Virgil, the roman poet
who led Dante is now leading Jack.

00:15:51.089 --> 00:15:53.850
They hear a strong ringing sound.

00:15:53.850 --> 00:15:58.199
The louder it gets means the closer they are
to where Satan is I believe.

00:15:58.199 --> 00:16:00.290
He is down in the lowest level.

00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:01.290
They stop at a good afterlife.

00:16:01.290 --> 00:16:02.290
The Elysian Fields.

00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:03.290
Jack cries upon viewing an image that is something
he enjoyed during his childhood where he grew

00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:04.290
up.

00:16:04.290 --> 00:16:05.290
They make their way through the circles of
hell, and Verge takes him past where he should

00:16:05.290 --> 00:16:07.170
actually be just to give him a tour.

00:16:07.170 --> 00:16:12.700
They stand right over a broken bridge, and
below is the final circle of hell where the

00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:14.309
most suffering happens, and where Satan sits
trapped.

00:16:14.309 --> 00:16:15.309
The ringing sound is deafening.

00:16:15.309 --> 00:16:19.519
Verge says he was actually supposed to deliver
Jack a couple circles up, which I take would

00:16:19.519 --> 00:16:23.910
be the violence circle since that's where
most murderers go.

00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:27.730
Jack asks what the path on the other side
of the bridge goes to.

00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:31.540
Verge says it leads out of hell and up into
heaven.

00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:37.869
Jack ponders that maybe you can Nathan Drake
across the walls to get to the other side.

00:16:37.869 --> 00:16:42.630
Verge says you can climb over there if you
want, but nobody has every made it across.

00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:46.079
And plus Jack you aren't even supposed to
be down at this level.

00:16:46.079 --> 00:16:49.720
Verge says good bye to Jack as he climbs across.

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:52.800
He climbs pretty well until gets to the midpoint.

00:16:52.800 --> 00:17:02.449
After some obvious trouble, Jack falls all
the way down to the worst part of hell..Doomed

00:17:02.449 --> 00:17:03.449
to suffer forever.

00:17:03.449 --> 00:17:04.449
Jack has hit the road!

00:17:04.449 --> 00:17:11.549
So now that we've seen what happens, lets
talk about the most disturbed moment and most

00:17:11.549 --> 00:17:18.449
enjoyed moment in that Spooky Stuff cue the
GOHAN!

00:17:18.449 --> 00:17:20.899
So let's get right into it.

00:17:20.899 --> 00:17:24.740
The most disturbed moment is probably the
Third Incident.

00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:27.329
Seeing children murdered is always tough to
witness.

00:17:27.329 --> 00:17:32.799
And the response of a mother towards the loss
of her children is always harrowing to view

00:17:32.799 --> 00:17:34.029
and listen to.

00:17:34.029 --> 00:17:35.210
Kinda like in Bedevilled.

00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:40.480
The most enjoyed moment is the epilogue as
Virgil leads Dante through hell.

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:43.060
I liked how this entire scene was.

00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:59.429
And overall it was satisfying seeing Jack
fall down.
