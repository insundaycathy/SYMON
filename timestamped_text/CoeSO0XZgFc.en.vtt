00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.960
Story Recapped here. Today I'm going to explain&nbsp;
a horror mystery film called Malevolent.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.000
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:14.000
In 1986 Scotland, Angela and Jackson Sayers&nbsp;
are siblings who make a living out of scamming&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.320
people who believe their houses are haunted.&nbsp;
The duo also works with Beth and Elliot.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.400
They introduce themselves as paranormal&nbsp;
investigators, even though they know nothing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.960
in that field. One day, the team receives&nbsp;
a booking from a small family whose mother&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.000
just recently died. Jackson assures Susie, the&nbsp;
daughter, that they will communicate with the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.480
mother and bring her to heaven. Beth and Elliot&nbsp;
operate on the technical part of their scheme.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:44.320
Angele initiates the interview as preparation&nbsp;
for contacting spirits. Frank, the father,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.560
tells her that his wife's nickname is Maddy.&nbsp;
Angela writes all the information while the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:54.080
others try to act like they are detecting energies&nbsp;
around the room. Frank asks about Angela's mother,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:58.720
who has also passed recently. Because of this,&nbsp;
she gets into a sad mood all of a sudden.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.440
Maddy was a tailor; most of the time, she&nbsp;
was always in the basement sewing clothes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.080
Angela and Elliot, who are the cameraman,&nbsp;
head to the basement and call Maddy's name.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.200
The room is dark and filled with mannequins that&nbsp;
have caught dust. As she tries to talk to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.640
spirit, Beth signals Elliot to play some recorded&nbsp;
voice. This excites Frank, believing that he has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:24.000
a chance to communicate with his late wife. The&nbsp;
session ends abruptly after Angela says that Maddy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.200
is now out of the house and at peace. Before going&nbsp;
upstairs to leave, Angela takes a last look at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.240
the dark basement. She notices three mannequins&nbsp;
by the window, so she stares at them intently.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.600
Suddenly, the mannequin in the middle takes&nbsp;
the form of Maddy and tries to attack Angela.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.640
She blacks out and wakes up with a bleeding&nbsp;
nose. At the moment, she is scared and confused,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.840
but Elliot helps her up.That night, they celebrate&nbsp;
in a nightclub after their successful session.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.320
Beth shows them an advertisement in&nbsp;
pamphlet form of their medium service.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.960
The team uses the reputation of the siblings' late&nbsp;
mother to promote Angela's powers as a medium.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.480
Elliot and Angela are not convinced with the&nbsp;
idea, so they walk out. Jackson orchestrates&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:09.200
the sessions because of the debt he owes to loan&nbsp;
sharks. Elliot checks up on Angela about the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.840
basement. She thinks that the team is just playing&nbsp;
a prank on her about Maddy and the mannequin,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:19.120
but Elliot tells her that he has no idea what she&nbsp;
is talking about. As soon as Angela arrives home,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.080
she browses through pictures of her mother. She&nbsp;
sees an envelope from Laurel Creek Psychiatric&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.720
Hospital. She continues to read some of her&nbsp;
mother's belongings and eventually falls asleep.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.520
The following day, she receives a call&nbsp;
from a potential client seeking help.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.760
The woman on the phone sounds frantic, so&nbsp;
Angela tells her that they are unavailable.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.040
She puts down the phone, but the&nbsp;
caller is determined to contact them.&nbsp;

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.640
The college dean calls Angela's attention for&nbsp;
brief counseling. She is concerned about Angela&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.440
because recently, she is unable to submit&nbsp;
assignments and attend class. Angela says&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.240
that she has not been feeling well for the past&nbsp;
couple of days. The dean brings out a newspaper&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:01.360
article titled "American Ghost Hunters Saved My&nbsp;
Family Home." She is now aware of the reason for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.720
Angela's incompetence in school. However, Angela&nbsp;
defends herself by saying that she does it for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.840
extra money. While the dean sermons her about the&nbsp;
importance of focusing in school, Angela hears a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.480
distant whisper calling her name. She glances&nbsp;
at the closed door and notices the knob move.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:23.040
Eventually, the door opens, and a person with&nbsp;
seemingly bloody hands enters. Angela is confused;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.280
the dean tells her that her nose is bleeding.&nbsp;
She makes her way out of the building to visit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.840
her grandfather. Angela is extremely close&nbsp;
to her grandfather and visits him regularly.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.720
They talk about Angela's mother while she's&nbsp;
there, but her grandfather refuses to talk&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.600
about his daughter and dismisses the topic.&nbsp;
Eventually, he gets up and complains about how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:47.280
her mother talked about hearing voices and seeing&nbsp;
paranormal things. This catches Angela off guard,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.080
and she breaks into tears because she worries&nbsp;
that she might end up like her. Later that day,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:56.000
Angela looks into the history of the caller's&nbsp;
house and discovers that the owner's foster&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.640
children were all found dead. The Sayers receives&nbsp;
another phone call regarding their services.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.760
As Angela arrives home, Jackson welcomes him&nbsp;
with his face covered in scars and bruises,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.800
after a man he owes money to beats him. He asks&nbsp;
her why she declined a client who is an old woman.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.920
She says that scary things go around that house,&nbsp;
but her brother gets agitated after bringing up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.720
their mother. This is still a sensitive topic for&nbsp;
the both of them; their mother wound up committing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.760
suicide because she saw people who weren't there.&nbsp;
Angela walks out and has a meltdown in her room.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.480
Beth packs her things because she is afraid of the&nbsp;
men that may hurt them if Jackson fails to bring&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:34.960
back the money he borrowed. That night, Angela&nbsp;
wakes up in the middle of the night after hearing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.920
noises outside her room. She goes downstairs&nbsp;
and sees her mother in the kitchen without eyes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.400
She realizes that it is just a nightmare and&nbsp;
talks to her brother about their new client.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.040
Jackson, needing the money to pay off&nbsp;
the loan sharks, agrees to the job,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:54.640
despite reluctance from his sister. They drive&nbsp;
to the countryside where the house is located at.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:58.320
Angela cannot stop thinking about her dream&nbsp;
and seems bothered during the whole trip.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:03.760
They arrive at a gated community, and an old&nbsp;
caretaker opens it for them. All four of them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:09.200
observe the house's exterior and sense an eerie&nbsp;
feeling. Mrs. Greene, the caller, welcomes the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:14.560
team to the home as she gives a tour. Mrs. Greene&nbsp;
is a very traditional woman; she highly values&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:19.440
good manners and common etiquette. Jackson hands&nbsp;
her over the payslip, but Mrs. Greene says she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:24.480
will sign it after the service is rendered. Angela&nbsp;
begins the interview about Mrs. Greene's concerns.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:31.040
According to her, screaming, laughter, and giggles&nbsp;
were what she heard initially. But over time,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:36.240
it turned into angry and taunting noises. She&nbsp;
reveals that it has been 15 years since Herman,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:41.360
her son, committed the act. Mrs. Greene blames&nbsp;
herself for not paying close attention to her
