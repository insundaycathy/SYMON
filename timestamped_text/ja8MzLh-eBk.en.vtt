00:00:06.554 --> 00:00:07.834
hey what's up guys

00:00:08.026 --> 00:00:11.418
today I'll show you an action-adventure film: "The Tomb Raider"

00:00:11.738 --> 00:00:14.234
spoiler ahead, watch out and take care

00:00:15.194 --> 00:00:18.714
Lara's explorer father has sought to uncover the dark secrets about Himiko

00:00:18.778 --> 00:00:23.898
the mythical Japanese Queen of Yamatai, who was said to command the power over life and death

00:00:24.026 --> 00:00:27.034
legend has it that the Queen ruled over the land with magic

00:00:27.162 --> 00:00:30.746
but she was rebelled by her general, and sealed on a remote island

00:00:31.194 --> 00:00:34.225
in order to prevent the revival of the wicked dead Queen

00:00:34.394 --> 00:00:38.554
the father went on a quest to find the island, containing the tomb of Himiko

00:00:38.874 --> 00:00:40.730
however, he never returned

00:00:40.922 --> 00:00:43.034
when everyone thinks that the father is dead

00:00:43.098 --> 00:00:46.746
his strong-willed young daughter Lara, refuses to give up hope

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.010
she has steadfastly refused to sign for her inheritance

00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:53.466
fearing that if she does, she will have to accept that her father

00:00:53.594 --> 00:00:58.394
who disappeared without a trace somewhere in the Sea of Japan, is truly dead and gone

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:02.490
without her father's fortune, Lara is struggling with her gym fee

00:01:02.618 --> 00:01:04.858
and earns a living by delivering food

00:01:05.114 --> 00:01:10.298
knowing that she could win the fox chase match, if she manages to outrun the team of hunters

00:01:10.426 --> 00:01:12.410
Lara volunteers to be the fox

00:01:12.538 --> 00:01:16.506
unfortunately, Lara mistakes a pedestrian as her father along the way

00:01:16.826 --> 00:01:21.754
distracted, she soon crashes into a police car, and ends up being arrested

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.186
later, Lara's Guardian bails her out 

00:01:24.314 --> 00:01:29.626
and continuously pressures Lara to sign in absentia documents to transfer her father's assets

00:01:29.754 --> 00:01:34.554
it turns out both the police and private detectives have given up on searching for her father

00:01:34.874 --> 00:01:39.802
if Lara does not claim her inheritance, the family company and estate will be sold off 

00:01:39.994 --> 00:01:44.922
for the sake of the family estate, Croft Manor, Lara finally meets up with the lawyer 

00:01:45.178 --> 00:01:48.954
at the signing, Lara is handed a puzzle box that was willed to her 

00:01:49.082 --> 00:01:50.810
before she pens down her name

00:01:51.002 --> 00:01:53.498
Lara immediately plays with the puzzle box 

00:01:53.562 --> 00:01:57.402
and opens it to find a photo, a key, and a note hidden inside 

00:01:58.042 --> 00:02:02.010
deciphering the hidden clue, Lara leaves the office for the Croft Manor

00:02:02.394 --> 00:02:06.682
piecing up all the hints, Lara gains access to her father's secret chamber

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.482
where she finds all his research into various matters of the occult, including Himiko

00:02:11.738 --> 00:02:13.658
ever since Lara's mother passed away

00:02:13.786 --> 00:02:16.858
her father has been searching for the source of supernatural power 

00:02:16.986 --> 00:02:22.554
in a pre-recorded message, the father orders Lara to destroy all research data about Himiko

00:02:22.874 --> 00:02:24.218
but Lara does not obey it 

00:02:24.346 --> 00:02:26.714
instead, she carefully studies everything 

00:02:26.778 --> 00:02:30.298
and decides on an expedition to find the island and her father

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:35.354
in order to raise money for the trip, Lara sells the jade pendant her father had given her

00:02:35.738 --> 00:02:38.938
upon arrival in Hong Kong, Lara finds Mr. Lu

00:02:39.066 --> 00:02:42.010
the captain of the ship who had been employed by her father

00:02:42.202 --> 00:02:45.338
but the drunk Mr. Lu does not welcome Lara at all 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.602
fortunately, Mr. Lu quickly falls into a drunken coma

00:02:48.666 --> 00:02:51.354
and he reluctantly answers all Lara's questions 

00:02:51.546 --> 00:02:56.538
to her surprise, the one hired by her father is not Mr. Lu, but his father instead 

00:02:56.794 --> 00:03:00.442
the two fathers embarked on the journey together and never returned 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:04.218
Lara spends some time deciphering the encrypted coordinates on the notes 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.842
and she hires Mr. Lu to bring her there 

00:03:07.226 --> 00:03:08.890
tempted by the high commission

00:03:08.954 --> 00:03:13.626
the experienced captain Lu takes Lara into the Devil's Sea and the island of Yamatai 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.890
in the middle of their journey, Lara opens the puzzle box 

00:03:16.954 --> 00:03:20.026
and learns that an ancient military organization Trinity

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.842
is also searching for the legendary tomb of the Queen

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.258
in addition, they want to rule over mankind by use of her supernatural power 

00:03:27.386 --> 00:03:31.738
hence when the father located the tomb of Himiko, he became the target for Trinity 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.026
the disappearance of her father and the existence of Trinity make Laura anxious

00:03:36.474 --> 00:03:39.738
in the middle of the night, Laura is awakened by a violent shock 

00:03:40.122 --> 00:03:43.578
Mr. Lu explains that when the ship approaches the island of Yamatai

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:46.010
they are caught up in a raging storm 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:50.554
as the ship capsizes, Lara and Mr. Lu abandon the ship and escape 

00:03:50.938 --> 00:03:55.162
Lara desperately paddles to the beach, but as soon as she reaches the shore

00:03:55.226 --> 00:03:58.298
she is surprise-attacked and knocked out unconscious

00:03:58.554 --> 00:04:03.418
the leader of Trinity, Vogel, imprisons Lara and robs her father's research notes 

00:04:03.674 --> 00:04:07.130
besides, he reveals to Lara that her father was killed by him 

00:04:07.578 --> 00:04:10.202
Laura is certainly devastated by her father's death 

00:04:10.586 --> 00:04:13.594
as the father did not tip off the location of Himiko's tomb

00:04:13.722 --> 00:04:16.154
Vogel has been searching aimlessly on the island

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:20.506
Lara's coming with the set of research data is the best news for Vogel 

00:04:21.018 --> 00:04:24.346
soon Vogel turns Lara and Mr. Lu into his slaves 

00:04:24.794 --> 00:04:28.762
the slave force consists of kidnapped fishermen and conned stowaways 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:32.346
when the slaves lose their value, they will be killed by Vogel 

00:04:32.666 --> 00:04:34.714
seeing Vogel pointing his gun at Lara

00:04:34.842 --> 00:04:38.170
Mr. Lu attacks Vogel to make time for Lara to break away

00:04:38.362 --> 00:04:42.522
after dodging numerous bullets from the enemy, Lara runs with her hands tied 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.850
and falls into the river while crossing a single-log bridge	

00:04:46.106 --> 00:04:49.434
with nowhere to escape, Lara is swept by the strong current 

00:04:49.562 --> 00:04:51.802
to the edge of the 100-meter waterfall 

00:04:52.058 --> 00:04:56.666
but in a strong desire for survival, she manages to grab hold of a broken plane 

00:04:56.794 --> 00:05:01.530
stuck in the waterfall between the rocks and hop onto the cabin before its wing falls

00:05:02.106 --> 00:05:05.242
and then she cuts the rope with a sharp metal inside the cabin 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:08.314
and catches a parachute before the cabin breaks apart

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:13.242
however, as the parachute is faulty, Lara is injured following her rapid descent 

00:05:13.562 --> 00:05:16.442
she briefly treats her wounds and hopes to get some rest

00:05:16.762 --> 00:05:20.474
however, on the same night, she is confronted by Vogel's guard

00:05:20.794 --> 00:05:22.714
even though physically she is much weaker

00:05:22.906 --> 00:05:26.362
tenacious Lara locks the enemy tightly with her hands and feet 

00:05:26.554 --> 00:05:29.434
and then she holds the man in the water and drowns him 

00:05:29.882 --> 00:05:34.234
shortly after she wipes out the avenger, she sees a figure moving in the jungle 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:38.330
Lara follows the figure all the way to a cave located in the middle of the hills 

00:05:38.522 --> 00:05:41.978
through the dim light, she finds the mysterious man to be no one else 

00:05:42.106 --> 00:05:44.474
but her father, whom she is searching for 

00:05:44.794 --> 00:05:49.530
at first, the father regards the appearance of Lara as merely his own hallucination 

00:05:49.786 --> 00:05:53.306
when he is convinced that Lara really comes to the island for him

00:05:53.434 --> 00:05:55.994
he tearfully helps to bandage his daughter's wounds 

00:05:56.506 --> 00:05:58.234
their joy of reunion is short-lived 

00:05:58.618 --> 00:06:02.842
as the father soon learns that Vogel has snatched all his research data 

00:06:03.098 --> 00:06:06.362
for years, the father has been carrying out his mission in secret

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:09.242
tricking his enemies into believing that he is dead 

00:06:09.498 --> 00:06:12.826
but now Lara's arrival and carelessness ruin everything 

00:06:13.082 --> 00:06:17.690
the anger-stricken father blames Lara for traveling to the island to destroy his work

00:06:18.138 --> 00:06:20.954
to make up for her mistakes, Lara takes up a bolt 

00:06:21.082 --> 00:06:23.642
and immediately returns to Vogel's camp alone

00:06:24.154 --> 00:06:27.674
there, Lara shoots the guard dead to free Mr. Lu 

00:06:27.866 --> 00:06:31.962
Mr. Lu, once armed, leads the rest of the slaves out of their hell 

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:34.970
while the guards are distracted by the rioting slaves

00:06:35.226 --> 00:06:38.106
Lara rushes into the camp to take the satellite phone 

00:06:38.298 --> 00:06:43.226
however, before her departure, she spots her father standing right in front of the tomb 

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:46.554
Vogel seizes the chance to take the father as a hostage 

00:06:46.682 --> 00:06:49.114
and threatens Lara to surrender her weapon 

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:51.866
Lara cannot bear to see her father getting hurt 

00:06:51.994 --> 00:06:55.578
so she agrees to open the door of the tomb according to what she knows 

00:06:55.898 --> 00:07:00.314
as Lara safely lands on the cave, Vogel and his people also enter the tomb 

00:07:00.506 --> 00:07:05.626
however, one of the soldiers accidentally triggers a booby trap and is shot dead right away

00:07:06.074 --> 00:07:07.930
when they come to the valley of souls

00:07:08.058 --> 00:07:11.066
Lara is ordered to lead them through the temporary ladder 

00:07:11.386 --> 00:07:14.522
even though the whole expedition team safely walk through the ladder

00:07:14.586 --> 00:07:16.506
another booby trap is activated

00:07:16.826 --> 00:07:21.946
as a result, the stone door is shut, and the floor tiles in the tomb also fall piece by piece

00:07:22.202 --> 00:07:27.514
in a pinch, Laura discovers the color puzzle on the tomb door and promptly derives the answer

00:07:27.898 --> 00:07:30.778
with the topaz and sapphire merging together on the door

00:07:30.906 --> 00:07:33.978
a green light is emitted to switch off the booby traps 

00:07:34.362 --> 00:07:38.842
passing through the tomb ramp, they finally get to see the Queen's magnificent tomb 

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:41.402
desperate to achieve his own agenda

00:07:41.466 --> 00:07:45.690
Vogel commands the soldiers to open the coffin without fully assessing the situation 

00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:50.682
but when exposed to air, the Queen's body instantly oxidizes and decays

00:07:50.874 --> 00:07:53.050
as the well-preserved body becomes skeletal

00:07:53.178 --> 00:07:56.186
Vogel demands the corpse be removed and taken away

00:07:56.506 --> 00:07:59.258
however, reading the mural painting in the tomb chamber

00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:02.714
Laura infers that the Queen was not unwillingly trapped here 

00:08:02.906 --> 00:08:07.642
but rather, she seems to have voluntarily quarantined herself on the island of Yamatai 

00:08:07.706 --> 00:08:09.562
for the survival of her people

00:08:09.754 --> 00:08:15.770
in a flash, Laura realizes that the Queen is in fact, a carrier of a highly contagious disease

00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:17.946
the Queen has developed antibodies

00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:21.402
but people who come into contact with her will die from the disease

00:08:21.594 --> 00:08:26.394
at this time, the booby trap of the coffin operates, and the two soldiers step back in fear 

00:08:26.586 --> 00:08:28.122
while Vogel scoffs at the fuss

00:08:28.186 --> 00:08:32.090
the soldier who has just touched the Queen's body suddenly mutates

00:08:32.410 --> 00:08:35.098
his rotting wounds spread from his fingertips to his body

00:08:35.290 --> 00:08:37.850
turning the soldier into a zombie-like monster

00:08:38.106 --> 00:08:42.906
after killing the dangerous soldier, Vogel understands the task given by his superiors

00:08:43.290 --> 00:08:47.130
he then takes the Queen's finger for the sample and prepares to evade the tomb 

00:08:47.322 --> 00:08:52.058
but at her father's signal, Lara launches an attack and leads a soldier out of the vault 

00:08:52.314 --> 00:08:56.474
while the father remains where he is and commandeers a pistol to tackle Vogel

00:08:56.858 --> 00:09:00.762
but all of a sudden, another infected soldier pounces on the father

00:09:01.082 --> 00:09:04.538
in the process of destroying the enemy, the father gets infected 

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:08.058
on the other side, the fleeing Lara activates the booby trap 

00:09:08.186 --> 00:09:11.002
and charges towards the huge barbed iron bar

00:09:11.258 --> 00:09:15.930
the guard who pursues her could not avoid the iron bar and is eradicated right away

00:09:16.506 --> 00:09:21.562
Lara returns to the tomb only to find her father already contracted with the virus 

00:09:21.818 --> 00:09:24.250
to prevent Trinity from succeeding in its plot

00:09:24.314 --> 00:09:28.026
Lara bids farewell to her father and dashes out to pursue Vogel 

00:09:28.282 --> 00:09:32.634
at the valley of the souls, Lara blocks Vogel from crossing by hooks and crooks 

00:09:32.762 --> 00:09:34.938
and even kicks the ladder down the valley 

00:09:35.322 --> 00:09:40.250
as his hope of leaving diminishes, furious Vogel punches Lara down to the ground 

00:09:40.698 --> 00:09:45.434
when he is about to slay Lara, the father sets off the bomb to blast the tomb

00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:49.850
Laura takes advantage of Vogel's distraction to pull the sample out of his pocket 

00:09:49.978 --> 00:09:51.834
and shoves it into his mouth

00:09:51.962 --> 00:09:56.506
shortly after Lara kicks Vogel down the valley, the whole grave starts to collapse 

00:09:56.954 --> 00:10:01.498
Lara takes a desperate leap forward and clamps to the opposite slate with her pick 

00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:05.850
as soon as she lands on her foot, Lara sprints to the entrance with all her strength 

00:10:05.914 --> 00:10:07.834
and climbs up the entrance with a rope 

00:10:08.282 --> 00:10:12.762
at the same time, Mr. Lu and the slaves are clearing the rubble from the tomb entrance

00:10:13.082 --> 00:10:16.410
with their help, Lara finally comes out from the grave safely

00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:21.466
together, they hijack a helicopter sent by Trinity and leaves the island 

00:10:21.786 --> 00:10:25.498
with everything set, Lara finally signs the letter of inheritance 

00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:29.914
out of trust in her Guardian, she continues to entrust the company to her 

00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:31.962
but when she looks at the asset list

00:10:32.154 --> 00:10:37.210
she discovers that the company which sponsors Vogel, Patna, is a subsidiary of Croft Holdings

00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:40.538
after returning to the estate and reviewing other documents

00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:45.466
Laura concludes that Guardian must be connected to the mysterious Trinity organization

00:10:45.722 --> 00:10:48.346
while redeeming her jade pendant at the pawnshop

00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:51.418
Laura sees the store collection of various munitions

00:10:51.674 --> 00:10:55.130
so she chooses two guns and gets ready for the unfinished battle 

00:10:55.962 --> 00:10:59.162
this's Daniel CC movie channel, peace out
