00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:07.280
Hi, Mystery Recapped here. Today I’m going&nbsp;
to explain an Italian fantasy-superhero film&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:13.634
called “The Invisible Boy,” Spoilers&nbsp;
ahead! Watch out and take care! 
&nbsp;

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:22.640
At the beginning of the movie, we see a boy named&nbsp;
Michele Silenzi, cycling to his school in Trieste,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:28.480
Italy. He has a fifty euro note with which he&nbsp;
plans to buy a costume for a party. At school,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.840
he sits behind his long-time crush, Stella.&nbsp;
Their class is interrupted by a police officer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.680
named Giovanna, who also happens to be Michele’s&nbsp;
mother. She is there to inquire about a student’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:45.200
disappearance. Giovanna requests the class to&nbsp;
inform the police if they hear from the missing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:51.360
student. After she leaves, Michele’s nose starts&nbsp;
to bleed, so he runs to the bathroom. His bullies,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.240
who have been troubling him for a long time,&nbsp;
threaten him into handing them all his money. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:01.280
goes back home, disheartened by the incident. He&nbsp;
brings out a few pennies he had saved and decides&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.480
to buy one with the money. Michele then visits&nbsp;
a rusty-looking store and asks for a superhero&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:12.240
costume. The shopkeeper hands him a skin-tight&nbsp;
overall and a lousy cape. He claims that it is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.760
the suit of a Chinese superhero. Michele doesn’t&nbsp;
seem fond of the costume but buys it anyway. 
&nbsp;

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:23.040
When Giovanna returns home from work, she sees&nbsp;
Michele in his costume refusing to go to the party&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.240
because he thinks he looks stupid. She reassures&nbsp;
him that he looks good and sends him to the party.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.040
There, Michele enjoys himself and even talks&nbsp;
to his crush Stella. But then, his bullies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.600
play a video of Stella walking through the street.&nbsp;
They claim that the video was found on Michele’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.320
phone and that he has been stalking Stella.&nbsp;
An embarrassed Michele runs to the bathroom&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.680
and locks himself in. All of his classmates bang&nbsp;
on the door from outside, asking him to open it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.320
Michele is frustrated and wishes that he was&nbsp;
invisible right before the lights go out. 
&nbsp;

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.960
In the following scene, we see him jump out of&nbsp;
the bathroom window and go back home. The next&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.440
morning, Michele wakes up to his dog barking at&nbsp;
him. He doesn’t pay him much attention and goes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.560
to the bathroom to brush his teeth. When he looks&nbsp;
into the mirror, Michele is beyond shocked to see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:12.640
just his robe and the brush. His body is invisible&nbsp;
in the mirror. Michele rushes out and takes his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.040
robe off. Just then, his mother walks in and&nbsp;
completely ignores the boy, proving that only&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.920
Michele can see himself. When she starts looking&nbsp;
around, Michele quickly writes that he has gone to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:28.080
school early on a paper and places it on the bed.&nbsp;
Giovanna reads it and dismisses the matter. 
&nbsp;

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.720
After leaving the room, she calls Michele on his&nbsp;
phone. An invisible Michele picks it up and tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:38.160
her that he is fine. Confused about what he should&nbsp;
do next, he dresses up in long-sleeved clothes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.360
After covering every part of his body, he goes&nbsp;
to school and watches Stella from afar. Michele&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.000
then notices his bully and plans to teach&nbsp;
him a lesson for troubling him so much. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.640
takes his clothes off and walks inside the&nbsp;
school naked and invisible. During class,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.440
he picks up the bully’s paintball gun and uses&nbsp;
it on the teacher, making the teacher suspend&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.720
the bully. Then, Michele makes his way to the&nbsp;
girl’s changing room and watches them undress. 
&nbsp;

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.000
Suddenly, a towel lands on him, making&nbsp;
his silhouette evident to everyone.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.720
Right then, his powers start to fade, making&nbsp;
him visible again. The girls scream as they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.520
see a naked Michele under the towel. 
The next day, Michele is in his class, where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:24.640
a psychologist named Basili is giving a lecture&nbsp;
about teens’ mental health. Two of Michele’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.360
classmates have run away from home in the past&nbsp;
month so he thinks it is necessary to understand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:35.200
teens’ way of thinking. As Michele listens to the&nbsp;
lecture, his hands start to glow, and suddenly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:40.800
they disappear. Thankfully, the class is over, and&nbsp;
he runs out before anyone can see him disappear.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:46.320
He rushes home, covering all parts of his body&nbsp;
and sees his little sister Candela in his room.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:52.000
Michele asks her to go downstairs while facing the&nbsp;
wall. A suspicious Candela opens and closes the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.880
door to make it seem like she has left. Michele&nbsp;
doesn’t turn around to check and starts to take&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:02.720
his clothes off. When he turns around, Candela&nbsp;
screams in fear, seeing her brother is invisible.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.720
Michele calms her down and tells her that&nbsp;
his costume has given him superpowers. 
&nbsp;

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:12.160
Meanwhile, at the police station, the psychiatrist&nbsp;
Basili works with Giovanna to investigate the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:17.040
missing children. Giovanna insists that the&nbsp;
children might be kidnapped, but Basili argues&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:22.320
they are just being rebellious, which is normal&nbsp;
for their age. When Giovanna returns home, Michele&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:28.080
is still invisible. Giovanna talks to someone&nbsp;
on the phone, revealing that Michele is adopted.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:33.280
A surprised and hurt Michele walks out of the&nbsp;
house to a nearby swing. While he is swinging,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:38.000
Stella arrives there and thinks Michele is&nbsp;
a ghost. She doesn’t seem to be scared and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.960
instead asks him to be her friend. He makes a&nbsp;
smiling face on the sand to communicate with her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:48.800
The two decide to meet again. After Stella&nbsp;
leaves, Michele sees a man nearby staring at him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:54.720
although he is invisible. The man walks away using&nbsp;
a stick, revealing that he is blind. At night,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:00.720
Michele visits Stella’s home. Stella is delighted&nbsp;
to have made an invisible friend. The two kiss but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.600
right then, Michele’s powers start to fade. He&nbsp;
runs away before Stella can see his face. 
&nbsp;

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:11.440
Later, Stella is in her gymnastic class alone&nbsp;
when a needle strikes her back. It makes her drop&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:17.360
unconscious. Elsewhere, Michele has decided to&nbsp;
tell Stella about him being the invisible boy. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:22.320
makes his way to her gymnastic class with his dog.&nbsp;
When he reaches the building, he sees a masked man&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:28.080
carrying Stella. Michele attacks the man and the&nbsp;
dog bites his hand. However, the man manages to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:32.560
escape with the girl. Later, the police arrive at&nbsp;
the scene. They figure that the missing children&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:37.360
weren’t running away but have been kidnapped.&nbsp;
Stella wakes up in a strange facility with her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:43.520
head attached to several wires. The psychiatrist&nbsp;
Basili is there interrogating her. It turns out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.920
that he is the one who has been kidnapping&nbsp;
the children. They run some tests on the girl&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:53.120
and send her to a cell. Two of her friends who&nbsp;
had gone missing before her are there too. 
&nbsp;

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:57.760
The following day, Michele is alone at a nearby&nbsp;
beach when suddenly, the blind man from the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:02.320
previous day appears in front of him. The man&nbsp;
answers all of Michele’s questions before he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:07.760
can ask them. It is as if he can read minds. When&nbsp;
Michele asks him who he is, the man reveals that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:13.520
his name is Andreij and he is Michele’s father.&nbsp;
The boy doesn’t believe Andreij and accuses him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:18.960
of lying. Andreij then begins to tell his story.&nbsp;
He used to be a normal man from a small town in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:24.400
Russia until a devastating nuclear explosion hit&nbsp;
the town. The radiation killed a lot of people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:29.200
and made a permanent change in others. 
It caused their DNA to mutate, giving them unique&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:34.640
superhuman abilities like flying, telepathy,&nbsp;
being invisible, and so on. These people were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:40.080
called the specials and were brought to a military&nbsp;
camp called the division to be used as weapons.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:45.600
The division used them beyond their capacity. The&nbsp;
more power the specials used, the weaker they got.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:50.480
Another side effect was that everyone was&nbsp;
infertile, except for Andreij and Michele’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:53.680
mother. So, breeding new specials was impossible.&nbsp;
The two gave birth to Michele, who was the first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:58.720
special kid. But as soon as he was born, they&nbsp;
took him away. So, the parents decided to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:02.800
run away with Michele and were successful. 
But the people from the division weren’t going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:08.000
to back down. They pursued the couple to bring the&nbsp;
child back. Michele’s father had the power to read&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.040
people’s minds, while his mother had the power&nbsp;
to be invisible. Andreji managed to run away with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:19.840
Michele, but his wife was killed by the division.&nbsp;
Andreji knew Michele wasn’t safe with him, so he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:24.800
put him in front of Giovanna’s door after reading&nbsp;
her mind and confirming she was a good person.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:29.840
Now, the people of the division have found out&nbsp;
that the special kid lives in the town. So they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:34.400
are kidnapping children and testing them to&nbsp;
see if they are special. After listening to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:39.600
his true origin, Michele is shocked. He almost&nbsp;
doesn’t believe it, but Andreji says that they do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:44.480
not have much time to talk because the fisherman&nbsp;
beside them thinks Andreji is suspicious and has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:50.160
called the police. Andreji hands Michele a suit&nbsp;
that turns invisible along with his body. He then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:55.520
removes the fisherman’s memory and leaves. 
The police arrive shortly along with Basili.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:55.520 --> 00:08:00.160
Giovanna reveals to him that Michele is adopted,&nbsp;
which makes Basili believe that he might be the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:05.680
special kid. He offers to take Michele home.&nbsp;
When they reach home, Michele notices Basili’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:10.000
hand injury, which is at the exact place&nbsp;
his dog had bitten Stella’s kidnapper.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.120
He looks at the man suspiciously and tries running&nbsp;
away. It turns out that Basili has locked all the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:20.640
doors and is planning to abduct him. Michele&nbsp;
runs into a room and takes off his clothes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:25.920
turning invisible. He manages to escape while&nbsp;
Basili follows him. When they are on the streets,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:31.680
Michele sees his bully Ivan on his bike. He sits&nbsp;
behind him and asks him to drive away quickly.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:37.280
A nervous Ivan obliges. When they reach a safe&nbsp;
area, Michele reveals himself to Ivan and tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:42.000
him all about their classmates’ abduction. 
Meanwhile, Stella and her friends see ventilation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.560
on the ceiling. They climb on each other, and&nbsp;
Stella manages to step outside. While hiding&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:51.040
from guards, she climbs a tower and reaches a&nbsp;
searching light. Believing that her invisible&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:55.600
friend is looking for her, she makes a smiling&nbsp;
face on the light and flashes it up to the sky.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:00.640
Michele sees the smiling face and realises&nbsp;
that Stella is trying to hint at them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:05.440
He and Ivan follow the light, but as soon as&nbsp;
they get there, Stella is caught by the guards.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:11.040
Ivan causes an electric malfunction using his&nbsp;
paintball gun as an invisible Michele goes inside.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:16.320
He sees Basili and his men monitoring Giovanna&nbsp;
and Andreji, who have joined hands to look for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:21.760
Michele. He then goes further in and knocks out a&nbsp;
guard. Using his gun, he threatens the other guard&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:26.400
to open the cell where Stella and the others are&nbsp;
trapped. After getting them out and trapping the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:30.640
guards inside, Michele reveals himself to&nbsp;
his friends, who are beyond surprised. 
&nbsp;

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:36.080
The boys want to run away, but Stella insists&nbsp;
they save an old man who she had seen locked&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:40.160
in another room. She and Michele go to&nbsp;
save the man, but Stella takes him to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:44.800
the villains instead and points a gun at&nbsp;
Michele. She suddenly falls unconscious,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:49.680
and the old man behind her starts talking. It&nbsp;
turns out that he has the power of mind control.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:54.160
He has been controlling Basili and Stella&nbsp;
to get Michele here. He then brings down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:58.720
a submarine and puts Michele and Stella in&nbsp;
it. The men take the two into the sea.
&nbsp;

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:04.320
Just then, Andreji and Giovanna arrive at the&nbsp;
place and meet Ivan. The building has been set&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:09.600
to explode in a few seconds. They quickly save&nbsp;
the two abducted kids and Basili from inside.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:14.400
Andreji reads Basili’s mind and realises that&nbsp;
someone was controlling him. They quickly get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:19.600
away from the building, which explodes in&nbsp;
pieces right after. Back in the submarine,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:25.200
Michele discovers his telekinesis power and&nbsp;
starts trashing the place. Using his powers,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:29.760
he manages to kill the men and save himself&nbsp;
and Stella. They finally get back to the shore,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:34.240
where a lot of people are waiting for them.&nbsp;
Michele goes invisible in front of them, flaunting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:39.040
his power. Andreji tells Michael that they will&nbsp;
have to remove everyone’s memories because the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:44.720
division will come looking for them again. Michele&nbsp;
obliges and kisses Stella for the last time. 
&nbsp;

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:50.640
Andreji tells Michele he will be back and leaves&nbsp;
after erasing everyone’s memories. Everyone then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:55.600
returns to their normal life. The scene cuts&nbsp;
to somewhere in Russia. Michele’s mother who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:55.600 --> 00:11:00.640
was thought to be dead was only wounded in the&nbsp;
encounter. She had defeated the division back then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:06.640
and is now ruling it. In fact, she was the one&nbsp;
who sent those people to get Michele back to her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:12.400
The woman is now against all the “normal” people&nbsp;
who look at them as if they are freaks. At last, a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:18.080
guard informs her that although they lost Michele,&nbsp;
they have found his twin sister Natasha. A clip of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:23.360
the past shows us that Andreji ran away with two&nbsp;
children that day. The movie ends as the guard&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:28.160
tells Michele’s mother that Natasha is somewhere&nbsp;
in Morocco, hinting towards a sequel.
