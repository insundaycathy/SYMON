Hi guys, Scifi Recapped here.

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:04.910
Before we start, WARNING!

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:05.910
Spoilers Ahead!

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.900
Today, I`m gonna explain a 2020 thriller movie
called Promising Young Woman.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.969
This movie is about a young woman haunted
by a traumatic past as she navigates balancing

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.020
forgiveness and vengeance.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.490
The movie begins with a woman alone at a bar
appearing incredibly intoxicated, barely able

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.180
to keep her head up and falling over in her
seat.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.320
She is then noticed by three average guys
and one of them named Jerry, who claims himself

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.360
to be a “good guy”, decides to approach
her and offer to pick her home.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.449
While on their way home, Jerry suggests that
they can go to his apartment first.

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:39.480
It turns out that Jerry is not a very “good
guy”.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.539
Despite her being barely conscious, he still
offers her alcoholic drink and starts to kiss

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:44.539
her.

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:48.539
He even moves her to his bed and begins to
do inappropriate things, only to realize that

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.489
the woman is not drunk and has been faking
it for the whole time, leaving Jerry in shock.

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.219
The woman is Cassie, a medical student dropout
on the brink of 30, who has no professional

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:02.640
ambitions, has no boyfriend, and still lives
with her parents` house.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.150
She currently works at a coffee shop to fill
his daily boring days.

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.160
Cassie, whose best friend, Nina, was raped
when the two were in medical school.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.030
Though Nina reported the rape and though there
was video evidence, no one at the school took

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.100
her claims seriously and punished the perpetrators.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.200
That is the reason Both Nina and Cassie left
school, and it’s heavily implied that Nina

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.600
later died by suicide.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.550
One day at the coffee shop, Cassie meets Ryan
who appears to be her former classmate at

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:30.310
the medical university.

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.170
He is confused with the fact that she works
as a barista, but soon he asks Cassie to go

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.900
on a date with him, but rejected.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.630
As shown previously, Cassie now spends her
nights in nearby bars, faking herself as a

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.650
drunk woman and posing as bait for men to
take her to their homes then revealing sobriety

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:49.770
when they try to take advantage of her, embarrassing
them and keeping a record of how many men

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.050
that has fallen into her trap.

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.300
On Cassie`s 30th birthday, her parents give
her a present and her mother starts to scold

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.270
him, saying that it is very strange for a
mature woman to still live in her parents

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.250
house, without having a boyfriend and a friend.

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.690
Surprisingly, the gift turns out to be a suitcase,
showing that her parents want her to get out

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:08.850
immediately.

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.050
Ryan comes back to the coffee shop to try
his second attempt, claiming that Cassie gave

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.970
him a fake number the other day.

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.520
Funny thing is that Ryan spent several hours
composing a very romantic text, only to find

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.090
out that the message was sent to an oil rig
worker called Red.

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.652
This time, he confesses that he has liked
Cassie since high school and asks her to go

00:02:26.652 --> 00:02:28.010
for lunch.

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.490
Finally, Cassie goes on a legitimate date
with Ryan.

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:36.240
Both of them start to develop a closer relationship
and Ryan seems to be a real “good person”.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.060
He asks Cassie to visit his apartment and
she agrees with that, but suddenly he feels

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.170
that it is too fast and he offers to drive
her home.

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.450
Eventually, it makes Cassie upset and she
goes home alone as Ryan is already at his

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:48.920
apartment.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.430
The next day, Cassie visits Ryan at the hospital
as he is currently working as a pediatrician

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.700
and says that she wants to continue the relationship,
but he has to take it slow.

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.430
At night, Ryan mentions one of his friends,
Al Monroe, the man who sent Cassie on this

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.560
spiral of grief and trauma, has just moved
back from London and is getting married which

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.420
makes Cassie upset.

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.450
Since then, she begins to plan a strategy
to revenge Nina on Al and others who were

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.240
responsible for him getting away with the
rape.

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:18.200
She then meets another former classmate, Madison.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.870
They have little conversation and we can see
that Cassie purposely wants to get Madison

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.000
drunk by keeping pouring her champagne.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.670
Cassie brings up the topic Nina`s rape several
years ago, but Madison keeps denying that

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:33.209
Nina was raped and implicitly says that it
was Nina`s drunk for getting drunk which disappoints

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:34.340
Cassie.

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.870
Turns out that Cassie also hires a man to
take the drunk Maddison to a hotel room.

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.770
With no memory of what has happened because
she was drunk, Madison leaves several distraught

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:46.000
voicemails to Cassie who doesn't answer her
call.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.480
The next target is the university's dean,
Elizabeth Walker.

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.110
But before that, Cassie lures Walker`s teenage
daughter, Amber, into her car by posing as

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.560
a new makeup artist for the popular band called
Wet Dreams.

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.340
Cassie tells the teenager that she is lost
and her phone is dead.

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.010
Because it is Amber`s favorite band, Amber
is willing to help by borrowing her phone

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:06.320
to Cassie.

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:10.250
After her plan works, she later meets Walker
under the pretense of resuming her med school

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.550
education and asks her about Nina`s case and
Al Monroe.

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:18.440
Here, Cassie reveals that Al took Nina and
raped her repeatedly in front of his friends

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:19.870
while she was drunk.

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:24.460
The dean seemed not to take the case seriously
at the time and even didn't remember the case.

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.340
Walker even implicitly says that Nina shouldn't
have been drunk at that time, despite her

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:29.740
being the victim.

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.290
To punish the dean, Cassie tells her that
she dropped her daughter at a dorm room with

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:34.330
male students.

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.180
At first, Walker doesn't believe her and threatens
Cassie.

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.230
But when Cassie hands over her daughter`s
phone, she becomes terrified and eventually

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:44.440
apologizes for her action.

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:49.150
At the end, Cassie reveals that she is lying
and her daughter is safe at the diner.

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:53.130
Even after building a good relationship with
Ryan, Cassie keeps acting as a drunk woman

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:56.390
in the bar, looking for a poor boy to become
her victim.

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:59.860
But unfortunately, she meets Ryan there while
hooking up with a guy.

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:03.150
Ryan is disappointed and leaves her alone.

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:07.620
The next day, Cassie continues his revenge
plan by meeting Jordan Green, Al`s lawyer

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:11.380
on Nina`s case, who forces Nina to drop the
charges.

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:15.060
Green then apologizes to Cassie and claims
that he will never forgive himself for what

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:16.470
he has done.

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:20.199
Because of that, Cassie forgives Green and
walks away, cancelling her plan to harm the

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:22.070
lawyer with a hitman.

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:26.470
After that, Cassie visits Nina`s mother, flashbacking
their good memories with Nina.

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:31.320
Nina`s mom urges Cassie to forget it and move
on, because it brings no good to everyone,

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.270
especially Nina.

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:37.790
After that, Cassie spots a post containing
information about Al Monroe`s bachelor party.

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:41.139
But, she decides to abandon her revenge plans.

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:45.820
She also visits Ryan and apologizes to him,
begging to start their relationship from the

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:46.820
beginning.

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:51.580
At first, Ryan still cannot accept the reality,
but later he approaches Cassie at the coffee

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:55.490
shop and they finally kiss for the first time
and fall in love with each other.

00:05:55.490 --> 00:06:00.040
Cassie even invites Ryan to her house and
introduces him to her parents.

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:03.150
Cassie is confronted by Madison outside her
house.

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:06.729
She urges Cassie to tell her what happened
while she was drunk after their lunch.

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:11.110
Cassie assures her that the man only put her
on the bed and nothing bad happened.

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:15.860
On that occasion, Madison hands over an old
phone containing a video of Nina`s getting

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:18.800
raped and warns Cassie to never contact her
again.

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:23.009
While looking at the footage, Cassie discovers
that Ryan was there as a bystander and decides

00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:25.430
to move forward on the revenge plan.

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:29.979
The next day, Cassie visits Ryan at the hospital
and shows the recording to him.

00:06:29.979 --> 00:06:33.770
She threatens Ryan that she will send it to
his colleagues, except he tells Cassie where

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:36.479
Al Monroe`s bachelor party will be held.

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:41.440
Not willing to risk her career as a pediatrician,
he finally gives the address to Cassie.

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:45.620
Ryan also demands forgiveness, but Cassie
refuses to do so.

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:47.340
Their relationship ends there.

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:52.009
Cassie arrives at Al`s bachelor party, disguising
herself as a nurse stripper.

00:06:52.009 --> 00:06:57.150
Al`s friend seems to be very happy about Cassie`s
arrival, not knowing what will happen next.

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:58.920
Cassie starts her show.

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:03.460
She orders all the boys to kneel down and
start feeding them with a huge amount of drink.

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:06.440
She takes Al upstairs and handcuffs him to
the bed.

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:10.660
When asked about her name, She answers that
she is Nina Fisher, which surprised Al because

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:14.060
the real Nina is dead and suddenly begs her
to let him go.

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:18.250
He screams for help, but Cassie has drugged
his friends with the drink before.

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:22.610
Al insists that he didn't do anything at that
time and says that Nina was also into it.

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:27.610
Cassie starts carving Nina`s name onto Al`s
skin, but Al suddenly manages to break free.

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:30.729
He tries to stop her but Cassie keeps fighting
back.

00:07:30.729 --> 00:07:35.030
Because of that, he grabs a pillow and smothers
Cassie with it for a very long time, causing

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:37.199
her to die because of suffocating.

00:07:37.199 --> 00:07:41.620
In the morning, a friend, Joe, approaches
him in the room and is shocked after knowing

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:43.830
the fact that Al has killed the stripper.

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:48.160
Both of them then manage to get rid of Cassie`s
body to cover up their crime.

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:52.320
After disappearing for several days, Cassie`s
parents file a missing person report to the

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:56.919
police and Detective Waller begins to investigate
the case by interviewing Ryan.

00:07:56.919 --> 00:08:00.330
He actually knows where Cassie went, but he
refuses to tell the detective.

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:06.259
Later, at Al`s wedding, the final act of Cassie`s
plan unfolds as Ryan receives several pre-scheduled

00:08:06.259 --> 00:08:09.370
texts from Cassie, telling him that things
aren't finished.

00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:14.210
Cassie`s manager also receives a half heart-shaped
necklace with Cassie`s name written on it.

00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:18.831
Also, the cops suddenly show up there, manage
to find the matching half with Nina`s name

00:08:18.831 --> 00:08:22.740
in Cassie`s burnt remains, and arrest Al for
the crime he has committed.

00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:26.770
Lastly, it turns out that Cassie had sent
the location of the bachelor party and the

00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:32.360
proof of the rape to the remorseful lawyer,
telling him to contact the police if she disappeared.
