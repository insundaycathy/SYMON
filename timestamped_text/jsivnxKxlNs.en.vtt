00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.490
Hello everyone, this is Mr. Brain Junkie here!
and today we'll be talking about a fantasy

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:05.990
film called dragon wars.

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:09.320
Be ready for some spoilers ahead!

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.019
Every 500 years, a woman is born with the
spiritual energy to transform a serpent into

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:15.650
a celestial dragon.

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.380
The creature that possess this power can determine
humanity's fate by either destroying or saving

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:21.619
the world.

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:25.760
Somewhere in the city of Los Angeles, the
police are examining the sudden appearance

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.730
of a giant trail, seemingly caused by a large
creature.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.790
Ethan is a reporter who's also here to investigate
the situation, but the government agents refuse

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.520
to answer any questions and tells him to leave
immediately.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.980
However, the man notices something strange
as he looks into the field and sees what appears

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.230
to a piece of scale buried inside the ground.

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.690
Apparently, Ethan has seen this before when
he was a child, and he begins recollecting

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.830
the memories as he stares into a strange medallion
that he wears.

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:59.710
Fifteen years ago, Ethan went to a local antique
store, accompanying his father as the man

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.080
tries to sell a blade to the store owner named
Jack.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.830
the boy looks through the items and sees a
mysterious box unlock itself after sensing

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.250
his presence.

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.650
The box opens and reveals a giant scale that
emanates an aura towards the boy.

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.670
The store owner perceives this and begins
having a heart attack, but when the father

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.720
tries to call the ambulance, Jack tells the
man to buy a medicine from the neighboring

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.470
shop instead.

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.940
Ethan's father tells the boy to look after
the old man and runs off quickly, but it turns

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.730
out that Jack faked everything in order to
speak to the boy alone.

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:37.410
He tells Ethan that there are giant serpent
called Imoogis that live in the heavens, and

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:42.500
every 500 years, one of the serpents is awarded
by its good deeds and turned into a celestial

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:43.690
dragon.

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.430
For this to occur, the creature needs a magical
object called the Yuh Yi Joo, but the evil

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.820
serpent Buraki and its followers have tried
for for a long time to steal the item.

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.960
500 years ago, the heaven decided to hide
the Yuh Yi Joo by sending it to a city in

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.710
Korea and guarded by its best warriors Haram
and his master Bochun,

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:08.229
but the evil serpent also knew the location
of this magical item.

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.980
The local lord's wife gave birth to a girl
name Narin, who was destined to be the holder

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.970
of the Yuh Yi Joo with a dragon birthmark
on her shoulder.

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.950
When the girl become 20 years of age, the
Yuh Yi Joo would form inside her, and the

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.330
evil serpent would appear once again.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.600
Narin soon becomes a beautiful woman, and
she begins falling in love with Haram who

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.810
shares the affection as well.

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.670
The master shows Haram the good Imoogi, who's
destined to become a celestial dragon and

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.730
the young man looks at the giant creature
in shock as it swims inside the waters

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.700
Bochun also give the man the medallion that
only the protector of Yuh Yi Joo wears which

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.920
can also protect him from harm when his life
is in danger.

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.520
Eventually, the evil serpent brings all its
followers to the village in search for the

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:56.480
girl, and the army begins firing numerous
bombs at the people, causing tremendous damage.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.020
They charge at the city and kills all the
men one by one as the people are no match

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:02.709
for their dragons and magic.

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:06.640
They capture all the women and looks through
every one of them, trying to find the girl

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.140
with the dragon birthmark on her shoulder.

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.640
The army soon arrives at the lord's house
and kills Narin's father in front of her,

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.560
causing the girl to run out and mourn for
her dying parent.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.240
The soldier rips open her clothing, discovering
her true identity and forcefully takes her

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.820
away from her home.

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:27.650
Luckily, the master flys in and fights the
army with his magic, giving Haram the opportunity

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.000
to save the girl.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.500
The two run into hiding, and the man tells
Narin the truth about her destiny.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.470
The master manages to escape the fight after
being wounded,

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.400
but finds the medallion on the ground with
his pupil nowhere in sight.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.750
Haram tries to run away with the woman instead
of bringing her to the good Imoogi, and the

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.270
evil serpent Buraki chases them closely behind.

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:52.940
The creature corners them on a cliff, and
the two decide to jump and fall into the oceans,

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:54.870
killing themselves in the process.

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.060
The store owner give Ethan the protector's
medallion and reveals that he's actually the

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:04.440
reincarnation of Bochun, and the boy used
to be Haram, the warrior that he raised.

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.490
This is their second chance in fulfilling
the prophecy and the boy must find a girl

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:13.440
named Sarah who also has the dragon tattoo
and bring her to the grand cave.

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.819
After remembering the girl's name, Ethan goes
to his friend Bruce and tells him to find

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:21.579
the girl, as she's likely to be related to
the giant trails,

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:25.539
but the friend tells Ethan that they need
more details as there are probably thousands

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:28.020
of women in the city with the same name.

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:33.059
Meanwhile, Sarah sees the news on tv about
the gigantic landmarks, and suddenly becomes

00:04:33.059 --> 00:04:37.919
warry about her safety, running home without
even saying goodbye to her friend.

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:42.330
She's clearly subconsciously aware of this
danger, and tries her best to protect herself

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.240
by looking through a book about ancient prophecies.

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.759
Her friend Brandy comes back home and is shocked
to see that Sarah has put up numerous paper

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:52.740
talismans in the house to ward off evil.

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:57.319
The girl tries to comfort Sarah and tells
her that she's only imagining the danger,

00:04:57.319 --> 00:05:02.520
but this doesn't help at all as she can't
shake the instinctual fear inside her heart.

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.740
Sarah's worries turn out to be valid as the
giant serpent has appeared in the city looking

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:10.379
for the Yuh Yi Joo, destroying everything
on it's path.

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:13.439
The girl begins having nightmares and waking
up at the night.

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:17.539
She feels an intense pain coming from her
birthmark and calls the ambulance to take

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:18.979
her to the hospital.

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:23.509
Brandy tries to look for her friend after
finding out that Sarah was hospitalized, but

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:27.889
the nurse refuses to let her visit as only
the girl's families are allowed.

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:32.729
With no other choice, Brandy goes to Sarah's
house to pack some clothings for her friend,

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:35.930
but suddenly feels the ground shaking from
the outside.

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:40.039
The girl runs out of the house, only to see
the giant serpent in front of her and screams

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:41.050
in fear.

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:46.430
Buraki bites her before she can escape and
tosses her into the pool, leaving her to die.

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:50.830
The next day, Ethan receives the report that
a woman was killed inside a house by what

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:52.870
the neighbors claim to be a giant snake,

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:58.020
and immediately heads towards the location,
fearing that Sarah may have died already.

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:01.930
When he arrives at the scene, he realizes
that the girl is not the one he was looking

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:06.569
for, and learns from the neighbor that Sarah
was taken to a hospital before the attack.

00:06:06.569 --> 00:06:11.189
He rushes towards the location to find the
girl, but is stopped by the front desk, who

00:06:11.189 --> 00:06:16.099
tells him that Sarah was put into quarantine
for a wound on her shoulder that may cause

00:06:16.099 --> 00:06:17.099
infections.

00:06:17.099 --> 00:06:20.569
Ethan tries to look for another way in, and
meets a doctor who's a big fan of the news

00:06:20.569 --> 00:06:24.059
reporter and helps him find the girl right
away.

00:06:24.059 --> 00:06:29.029
Ethan tells her that he believes in the danger
that she's feeling and explains that they

00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:32.199
must leave this place as the monster is close
by.

00:06:32.199 --> 00:06:36.119
Suddenly, they feel the whole building shake
violently as the giant serpent has tracked

00:06:36.119 --> 00:06:38.029
them to the hospital already.

00:06:38.029 --> 00:06:43.289
The doctor rushes in and tells the two to
leave right away as they are in great danger.

00:06:43.289 --> 00:06:47.869
Ethan takes the girl towards the exit as the
doctor slowly transforms into Jack, who was

00:06:47.869 --> 00:06:50.059
watching over them from the very beginning.

00:06:50.059 --> 00:06:54.569
They run to the car driven by Bruce, and the
man hits gas pedal right away after seeing

00:06:54.569 --> 00:06:59.830
the monster appear in the garage, chasing
after them as it destroys everything in sight.

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:04.210
They rush out of the hospital and manages
to escape quickly, as the creature charges

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:08.419
out one step behind and roars in frustration
towards its prey.

00:07:08.419 --> 00:07:12.939
Before they can catch their breath, Bruce
hits someone with the car and stops immediately,

00:07:12.939 --> 00:07:17.319
but it turns out that the man is a servant
of Buraki and plans to take Sarah back to

00:07:17.319 --> 00:07:18.629
his master.

00:07:18.629 --> 00:07:22.530
The two tries everything they can to stop
the General, but their attacks are useless

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:24.229
against the man's armor.

00:07:24.229 --> 00:07:28.720
Luckily, the man was hit by a car before the
girl was taken and the driver takes them away

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:30.490
quickly from the danger.

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:34.909
The woman drops off the two after confirming
that they are not hurt, and begins transforming

00:07:34.909 --> 00:07:40.160
back into Jack, showing that the old man continues
to help them in their perilous journey.

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:43.779
Sarah is confused about everything that's
happening, and questions the visions that

00:07:43.779 --> 00:07:47.119
she keeps on seeing in her dreams, doubting
her own sanity.

00:07:47.119 --> 00:07:52.149
In order to find out about the truth behind
her past, Ethan suggests that they go to a

00:07:52.149 --> 00:07:57.270
psychology professor of his who specializes
in extracting repressed memories.

00:07:57.270 --> 00:08:01.899
He promises to keep her safe as they share
a kiss on the beach, but Ethan realizes that

00:08:01.899 --> 00:08:06.020
her destiny is to die if she's really the
holder of the Yuh Yi Joo.

00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:10.149
On the other side, the continuous attacks
in the city has caught the government's attention,

00:08:10.149 --> 00:08:15.469
and they begin to suspect that Sarah is somehow
responsible for the monster's appearance.

00:08:15.469 --> 00:08:19.599
The mission leader realize that they may have
to terminate the girl, if they are not able

00:08:19.599 --> 00:08:23.550
to contain the situation as the creature seems
to be looking for her.

00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:27.819
At the same time, Buraki's general begins
summoning more of the serpent's followers

00:08:27.819 --> 00:08:32.300
and monsters into the world using numerous
ancient scrolls, and they prepare to take

00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:34.620
Sarah by any means necessary.

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:39.160
The government manages to track down the location
of the giant serpent, and sents an army of

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:41.830
special forces to terminate the beast.

00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:45.800
They head inside the cave of the monster,
and sees the enormous creature appearing in

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:46.830
front of them.

00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:51.330
The soldiers quickly retreat in fear and begins
shooting at Buraki, but their attacks are

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:54.480
useless as they continue to run from the monster.

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:58.670
However, the the serpent's army arrives on
the other side and forces the soldiers into

00:08:58.670 --> 00:08:59.780
a corner.

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:04.290
The general summons his magic towards the
men and destroys them in a single attack.

00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:08.300
Meanwhile, Ethan's professor is trying to
extract the suppressed memories from Sarah's

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:12.820
mind and eventually, the girl begins seeing
her childhood and then even further into her

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:14.250
past life as Narin.

00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:19.310
Her spiritual power begins awakening as her
memories return, surrounding her in glowing

00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:21.760
lights as Ethan watches in amazement.

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:27.600
Sarah recovers from the experience, but her
powers have also alerted Buraki to their locations,

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:30.470
forcing them to run immediately away from
the house.

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:35.680
The two drives away quickly as the giant snake
destroys the house and chases them close behind,

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:37.690
tearing up the entire street in the process.

00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:42.530
Luckily, they manage to lose the monster in
the residential areas, and Ethan calls his

00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:47.820
friend to arrange a helicopter as he realizes
that they can no longer be safe on the ground.

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:51.960
They meet up with Bruce in a restaurant who
gives them supplies and tells them that the

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:54.450
helicopter is on top of the news building,

00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:58.860
but the giant serpent manages to locate them
once again, and begins destroying the entire

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:00.560
building to capture the girl.

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:04.950
They run quickly away from the building as
the monster chases them from behind.

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:09.240
Before they can be captured, the police officers
fire at the giant creature and distract it

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:11.960
long enough for them to escape temporarily.

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:16.490
They continue running towards the news building,
as the monster chases after them, destroying

00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:20.190
everything on its path and sending the cars
flying in the air.

00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:25.130
The people in the city panic and runs in fear
while the creature causes numerous explosions,

00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:27.930
resulting in tremendous damage in the area.

00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:31.810
The two runs inside the news building and
eventually makes it to the rooftop where the

00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:33.450
helicopter is waiting for them,

00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:37.910
but the creature has noticed their whereabouts
and begins climbing to the roof as well.

00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:42.770
The helicopter tries to take off, but the
serpent launches and grabs on top the aircraft,

00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:46.770
forcing Ethan to jump out with Sarah before
it smashes the carrier through the air and

00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:48.190
onto the ground.

00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:53.030
Dark clouds begin covering the sky as Buraki
roars in victory and stares directly at the

00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:56.740
couple, planning to devour them to acquire
the power of the heavens.

00:10:56.740 --> 00:11:01.720
Luckily, they are saved when the US military
arrives and begins shooting furiously at the

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:05.680
creature with a barrage of missiles and bullets,
giving them the chance to escape from the

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:06.680
building.

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:10.840
The serpent tries to fight back and destroys
multiple choppers, but the army's combined

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:15.410
fire power manages to knock down the giant
beast and sends it tumbling to the ground.

00:11:15.410 --> 00:11:19.800
They continue to shoot relentlessly as the
creature scream in pain, but what they don't

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:23.740
realize is that an army of dragons is approaching
quickly to the city.

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:28.610
The monsters attack the choppers by shooting
out multiple fire balls, causing huge explosions

00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:31.170
as the aircrafts are forced to retreat.

00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:35.110
The ground troops of the monsters arrive as
well, and begins launching numerous bombs

00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:38.680
at the police, causing explosions to engulf
the area.

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:43.230
The military responds by mobilizing armored
vehicles towards the creatures and it's army

00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:45.800
of darkness led by the serpent's general.

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:50.490
The two armies march closer towards each other,
and begins a massive battle as the monsters

00:11:50.490 --> 00:11:52.630
charge towards the US military.

00:11:52.630 --> 00:11:57.670
The tanks fire at the army and begins killing
the creatures, but the enemy also retaliate

00:11:57.670 --> 00:12:01.300
by shooting numerous bombs at the vehicles
causing tremendous damage.

00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:05.730
Meanwhile, Ethan manages to escape the building
with Sarah, but they run into the government

00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:10.240
agents who claims to be here to help them
and take them away from the chaos.

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:14.670
The agents bring them to an underground facility,
and the senior officer reveals that he knows

00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:16.060
about the ancient legends.

00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:20.110
He plans on killing the girl to end this madness
even if it means that the creatures would

00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:22.630
come back 500 years later.

00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:26.990
Before the man can fire the gun, the other
agent shoots his partner, as he realizes that

00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:30.500
in order to save humanity permanently, the
girl must live.

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:34.590
He gives them the cars keys and tells Ethan
to protect Sarah until they can change the

00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:36.190
fate of the world.

00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:40.560
Ethan drives the girl towards the borders
and plans to escape into Mexico, but Sarah

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:45.000
claims that their actions are useless because
Buraki will track her down where ever she

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.000
goes.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.500
Before they can finish their conversation,
the dragons attack their car with fire balls,

00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:53.300
causing them to flip over and crash onto the
road.

00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:56.930
Ethan slowly loses consciousness as the monsters
begin surrounding them.

00:12:56.930 --> 00:13:02.070
When the main character wakes up, he realizes
that he's tied up to a pole in the desserts,

00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:03.760
surround by the army of darkness.

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:08.230
They bring the girl towards the altar and
ties her up to the table, preparing her to

00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:10.610
be sacrificed for the evil serpent.

00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:15.130
The general and the army chants Buraki's name
as they open the massive door, releasing the

00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:17.820
monster so that it may devour the girl.

00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:22.440
The giant serpent moves closer to the women
and tower over everyone, While Sarah screams

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:25.220
in fear at the sight of this monstrosity.

00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:29.800
Ethan screams the woman's name hopelessly
which awakens the medallion on his chest,

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:34.260
summoning the thunders from the heavens which
concentrates the energy into a large shockwaves

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:37.450
that stuns the entire army and turns them
into dust.

00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:42.130
The giant serpent recovers from the explosion
and attacks them with anger, knocking Ethan

00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:43.910
away from the girl.

00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:48.530
Before it can Devour Sarah, another Imoogi
charges towards it and knocks it to the ground.

00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:53.200
It carries Buraki by its jaws and throws the
monster away from the couple.

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:58.150
The two giant monsters roar at each other
and Buraki launches towards the other Imoogi,

00:13:58.150 --> 00:14:01.730
biting it's neck and throwing the giant serpent
onto the floor.

00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:06.380
Sarah realizes that she must fulfill her destiny
as it's the only way this whole thing can

00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:07.380
end.

00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:11.440
She walks towards the serpents and summons
the Yuh Yi Joo from her body, into the sky.

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:15.600
Buraki tries to grab the glowing orb, but
Sarah sends it the other way and the good

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:18.670
Imoogi swallows the energy at this opportunity.

00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:23.590
The evil serpent sees this and begins attacking
his foe, but the good Imoogi transforms and

00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:28.190
shed the skin on its body, finally turning
into a celestial dragon.

00:14:28.190 --> 00:14:32.790
It screams furiously and grabs Buraki, slamming
the serpent onto the ground.

00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:37.120
The monster recovers and begins attacking
the dragon once more, but is no match for

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:41.070
the celetial creature as it gets thrown to
the floor once again.

00:14:41.070 --> 00:14:45.790
The dragon flys towards the sky and Buraki
tries to grab onto its tail, causing both

00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:47.790
of them to launch into the air.

00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:52.610
The good Imoogi turns around and strikes the
serpent by its neck, tossing the monster downwards

00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:54.710
as it crashes into the ground.

00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:59.480
The dragon then charges a massive fire ball
and shoots it right inside Buraki's mouth,

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:03.360
causing the serpent to burn from the inside
and eventually turn into dust.

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:08.100
The dragon flys back towards Ethan and spits
out the Yuh Yi Joo, which causes Sarah's body

00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:12.570
to evaporate into a glowing aura that fuses
with the magical orb.

00:15:12.570 --> 00:15:16.990
The celestial dragon roars towards the heavens
and grabs onto the Yuh Yi Joo.

00:15:16.990 --> 00:15:21.340
It then launches towards the sky and slowly
vanishes into the clouds as it sheds tears

00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:23.520
of sympathy for Ethan's lost.

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:27.700
Jack appears behind the man and tells him
that he did the right thing, before vanishing

00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:29.850
as well to the other world.

00:15:29.850 --> 00:15:34.360
Ethan says goodbye to his master and begins
walking towards the dessert into a new future

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:37.700
that he's created for mankind.

00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:39.560
