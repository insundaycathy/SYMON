00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.480
Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:06.910
Today, I’m going to explain an action, adventure,
and comedy film called, “Small Soldiers.”

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:08.109
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:09.500
Watch out and take care.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.620
Globotech Industries, the top weapon defense
contractor, has just acquired Heartland Toy

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.240
Company as part of their big move to incorporate
battlefield technology with home consumer

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:18.240
products.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.580
Heartland’s head toy designers, Irwin Wayfair
and Larry Benson meet with the executive assistant,

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.529
Ms. Kegel, ahead of their big meeting.

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:30.119
She briefs them about the company and leads
them to a room.

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.820
The designers meet Globotech C.E.O. Gil Mars
who wants to hear their ideas about creating

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.070
a new toy line.

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.210
Irwin nervously presents his design, a team
of hybrid monsters called the Gorgonites,

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.950
lead by a character named Archer.

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.620
On the other hand, Larry swiftly delivers
his design, a team of toy soldiers whom he

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.420
calls the Commando Elite and is led by Chip
Hazard.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.620
Gil selects Larry’s idea for the project
and makes Irwin’s Gorgonites the enemies

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.050
of the Commando Elite.

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.290
He then takes the idea a step further and
orders a team to create a toy that moves and

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.359
talks back as the children play with it.

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.149
These will be actual live-action toys capable
of “playing back.”

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.830
After the meeting, Ms. Kegel informs the two
that Gil has given them three months to complete

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:08.340
the entire project.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.640
She also gives them their security cards and
unique passwords to the company’s online

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:12.640
account.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.840
Later that night as they work on the designs,
Larry accidentally forgets his password and

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.510
inputs Irwin’s password to search for internal
parts.

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.830
He then orders thousands of military-enhanced
microprocessor chips.

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.560
The new toy line is soon completed and is
packed for shipping.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:30.040
Meanwhile, on the other side of town, Alan
Abernathy tends to his family’s toy store.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.810
The business has been slow and the store is
on the verge of closing.

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.610
A Heartland delivery truck stops in front
of the store and the delivery guy, Joe, lets

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.840
Alan sign on a couple of shipments for their
store.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.450
Curious by the new toy line, Alan activates
Chip Hazard and Archer.

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.540
Alan is excited to see that the toys can move,
talk, are voice-activated, and even have a

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.200
two-way radio system that acts as a walkie-talkie.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.790
He asks Joe if he could lend him the set and
he’ll pay him the money by the time the

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.110
whole set is sold.

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.030
Joe agrees and gives him a whole set.

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.930
Alan leaves the toy in the backroom as he
sets up the rest of the action figures in

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:59.930
the shop.

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.970
Unbeknownst to him, Chip Hazard and Archer
can move on their own and are about to start

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:03.970
a war.

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.380
Back at the front counter, Alan’s neighbor
and biggest crush, Christy Fimple arrive with

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.540
her little brother, Timmy, to pick out a toy
for his birthday.

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.920
Timmy sees the new toys and decides that it’s
what he wants for his big day.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.280
Christy asks Alan to reserve Chip Hazard for
her brother and the two leaves.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.940
Alan looks out the store in dismay as he sees
Christy’s boyfriend, Brad, park by the curb

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:24.940
to kiss her.

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.090
He returns to the back room and puts the toys
back in their boxes.

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.070
He finishes setting up the display, closes
the shop, and brings his father’s ticket.

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.950
At their home, Alan’s father, Stuart, is
in a panic state as he prepares his things

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.170
for his trip to attend a business seminar.

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:44.300
His wife, Irene, tries to calm him down, but
his nerves are rattled again by a ruckus coming

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:45.760
from the Fimples’ yard.

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.650
It turns out, Christy’s father, Phil is
hacking down a tree branch that’s blocking

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:51.980
his satellite dish.

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.560
Stuart curses him out but his wife ushers
him inside.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.500
Alan arrives just in time to give his father
his plane ticket.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.110
Stuart thanks him, bids them goodbye, and
leaves for his seminar.

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.540
A little later, Alan is working on his homework
when he finds one of the Gorgonites, Archer,

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:05.930
inside his backpack.

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.790
He activates the toy and is shocked when Archer
suddenly talks back and repeats his name.

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.750
Thinking that it must be his imagination,
Alan goes back to studying.

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.450
Meanwhile, back at the toy store, Chip Hazard
breaks free from his box and frees the other

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:25.200
members of the Commando Elite, Butch Meathook,
Nick Nitro, Brick Bazooka, Link Static, and

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.360
Kip Killagin.

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.060
They set out on their mission to destroy all
Gorgonites.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.690
Back at the house, Alan falls asleep studying
and Archer comes back to life.

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.730
He opens the computer and starts searching
for a land called Gorgon.

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.990
Suddenly, the cat climbs up on the desk and
starts licking Archer.

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:43.150
Alan wakes up and discovers that Archer is
an actual live-action toy that has a mind

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:44.240
of its own.

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.100
Archer tells Alan that their only goal is
to set the Gorgonites free.

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.140
Back at the toy store, Chip heads the Commando
Elite team and breaks the Gorgonites from

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:51.180
their boxes.

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.060
An all-out war starts and continues into the
deep of the night.

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.240
When morning comes, Alan finds all the toys
missing from their boxes.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.210
Archer tells him that the Commando Elite must
have fought them through the night.

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:03.349
All that was left were pieces of one of the
Gorgonites, Troglokhan.

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:06.910
Christy arrives and assumes that the store
has been robbed and helps Alan clean up.

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.350
They bond quickly and soon learn that they
have more interests in common than they think.

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.630
Stuart arrives and Alan almost gets away with
it until he finds out that the toy ship is

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:14.630
broken.

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:17.500
He also realizes that most of his workshop
tools are gone.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.120
As Christy leaves, she hands him Archer, whom
she kept away from his dad’s sight.

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.000
Alan stuffs the toy in his backpack and rides
his bike home.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.540
Unbeknownst to him, the Commando Elite is
keeping an eye on him and is launching an

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:28.540
ambush.

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:30.790
They launch Brick onto the bike but he’s
soon chased by a dog.

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:34.090
Alan fends the dog away as Brick makes his
way to the boy’s backpack.

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.680
He loses his grip and finds himself at the
wheel again.

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.710
The bike hits a pothole and Brick crashes
onto the road in pieces.

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:42.990
The Commando Elite tapes Brick back together
and discovers Alan’s house.

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:46.320
Meanwhile, Alan calls customer service and
complains about the toys but no one would

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.900
take him seriously.

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.050
Feeling frustrated, he jumps into bed and
puts on his headphones, unwilling to talk

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:52.050
to Archer.

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.820
At Globotech, Larry had just finished announcing
their new toy line when Irwin played him the

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:57.690
tape of Alan’s voicemail complaint.

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:00.880
Irwin tells him that they can’t have dangerous
toys on the market or else they’ll be forced

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.310
to recall the line.

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.720
Larry gives in and Irwin realizes that his
colleague placed munition chips from the Department

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.570
of Defense in children’s toys.

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:10.500
Back home while Alan is asleep, Archer explores
the house.

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.720
He opens the closet and finds Chip Hazard.

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.040
The Commando Elite jumps on him and ties him
up.

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.840
In the bedroom, Alan wakes up and finds the
soldiers torturing Archer over the sink.

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.880
The toys run away as he frees Archer.

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.610
He then takes Nick Nitro and places him inside
the sink, destroying his plastic legs.

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:28.210
Alan’s parents come out to check the commotion
and find him with a bleeding hand.

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:31.919
As his parents reprimand him, Nick Nitro drags
his body up the sink and escapes.

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:35.770
Alan tries to explain that it was the toys
but as expected, his parents don’t believe

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:36.770
him.

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:39.540
He ends up confessing that Joe lent him the
toys and he was planning to pay him back.

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:42.020
They think he’s gone insane and send him
to his room.

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:45.340
In the bathroom, Alan is mad at Archer for
not helping him out, but the toy reminded

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:47.590
him that he was the one who told him to shut
up.

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:50.460
The two then form a plan to find the Gorgonites
before the soldiers do.

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.040
In the garage, Chip Hazard rendezvous with
his team.

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.860
Nick Nitro joins them but his battery has
already worn out.

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:59.040
They then plan to enhance their weapons with
the tools in the garage.

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.910
The next day, Alan and Archer are back at
the toy store.

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:04.900
They think about where the Gorgonites might
be hiding and Alan realizes that they must

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:06.139
be in the trash.

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:10.500
He goes to the dumpster behind the store and
finds the rest of Archer’s team, Ocula,

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:15.889
Punch-it, Scratch-it, Slamfist, and Troglokhan.

00:06:15.889 --> 00:06:19.260
It turns out they fixed up Troglokhan using
the broken radio from the store.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:23.889
Meanwhile, back at Globotech, Larry and Irwin
talk to Ralph, the scientist who crafted the

00:06:23.889 --> 00:06:25.139
microprocessors.

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:28.400
They learn that the chips are almost perfect,
developing a sense of intelligence through

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:32.570
learning, except for one key flaw: they can
be destroyed by an electromagnetic pulse.

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:36.410
Back at the house, Alan and the Gorgonites
hang out in his room just as Christy calls.

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:40.330
He invites her out but she turns him down,
telling him that she’s already dating Brad.

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:43.630
As they innocently flirt, Chip Hazard hacks
into the phone wire and listens in on their

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:47.380
conversation, and learns that the Gorgonites
are alive and in Abernathy’s residence.

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:50.550
The soldiers finish creating their weapons
and set out for their assignments.

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:54.590
Alan then learns that the group's main purpose
is to look for their home, the Isle of Gorgon.

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:57.250
He feels bad for telling them that the Isle
of Gorgon doesn’t exist and they’ll have

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:58.840
to find their own home.

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:03.530
Meanwhile across the yard at the Fimples’,
Phil and his wife, Marion, are settling in

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:06.410
for a night in front of their brand new, high-tech
television set.

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:10.260
The soldiers sneak into the room and fire
a few sleeping pills into their drinks.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.620
The couple soon falls asleep and the troop
sets camp in Christy’s bedroom.

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:16.640
Timmy arrives and tries to play with them
but they quickly attack the boy and tie him

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:18.500
up before throwing him into the closet.

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:20.870
The troop soon finds Christy’s doll collection.

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:24.040
They integrate the dolls into their army by
recreating Nick Nitro’s chip into each of

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:25.160
the dolls’ brains.

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:29.510
Now, the microchip has turned the dolls into
an army of violent zombies ready for action.

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:32.449
Back at the house, Alan teaches Archer about
the wind and how there are some things that

00:07:32.449 --> 00:07:35.120
you can’t see, but it doesn’t mean that
they don’t exist.

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:39.130
Archer feels reassured that if they keep looking,
they will eventually find the Isle of Gorgon.

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:42.100
When Christy gets home, she doesn’t notice
her parents knocked out and her brother in

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:43.139
the closet.

00:07:43.139 --> 00:07:46.400
She rejects an invitation from Brad to hang
out and heads up to her bedroom.

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:49.660
When she opens the door, she’s shocked to
see the assembly of zombie dolls that have

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:50.660
formed.

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:53.100
She screams as the dolls take her down by
the feet and tie her up.

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:54.960
It’s time for the doll’s revenge.

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:58.150
Brad hears Christy’s scream and rushes to
her bedroom only to find her overtaken by

00:07:58.150 --> 00:07:59.150
the dolls.

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:01.690
The toys lunge at Brad and he throws away
the dolls.

00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:06.110
The Commando Elite arrives and fires a flamethrower
at him, making him trip all the way down the

00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:07.110
stairs.

00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:08.400
Brad takes his flaming pants and runs out
of the house.

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:12.550
At Abernathy’s house, the soldiers shoot
a videotape through Alan’s bedroom window.

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:14.160
It’s a recording of Christy.

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:17.980
They’ve forced her in front of the camera
and are making her deliver a message to them.

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:21.759
In exchange for Christy’s safety, Alan must
hand over the Gorgonites to them.

00:08:21.759 --> 00:08:24.550
Feeling determined, Alan conjures up a plan
of counterattack.

00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:27.700
He delivers a box labeled Gorgonites in front
of the Fimples’ house.

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:31.140
With the soldiers distracted, he runs to the
backyard and fires a rocket that sends Archer

00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:33.149
parachuting into the Fimples’ house.

00:08:33.149 --> 00:08:35.349
Archer opens the back door and lets Alan in.

00:08:35.349 --> 00:08:38.139
They find the Fimples asleep and head over
to Christy’s bedroom while the soldiers

00:08:38.139 --> 00:08:40.240
drill a stick of dynamite into the box.

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:43.159
Alan is disturbed to see the dolls and they
try to take him over.

00:08:43.159 --> 00:08:46.170
Archer cuts off the rope from Christy’s
hand and now that she’s free, she starts

00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:48.029
hammering the toys with a baton.

00:08:48.029 --> 00:08:51.999
The box outside explodes, but much to the
troops’ dismay, it’s only a decoy.

00:08:51.999 --> 00:08:56.059
Christy gives Alan a kiss for saving her and
another kiss to officially mark their relationship.

00:08:56.059 --> 00:08:59.369
When they run downstairs, the soldiers fire
a flamethrower at them.

00:08:59.369 --> 00:09:01.459
The two escape through the bedroom window.

00:09:01.459 --> 00:09:05.199
As they run, an explosion comes from the garage
and the troop drives out in their weapon-optimized

00:09:05.199 --> 00:09:06.199
vehicles.

00:09:06.199 --> 00:09:08.399
They fire at Alan’s leg and take him down.

00:09:08.399 --> 00:09:10.399
Christy takes the motorcycle and rescues Alan.

00:09:10.399 --> 00:09:14.110
They escape but the soldiers are now in pursuit,
firing at them with their weapons.

00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:17.100
Chip Hazard launches a rocket at a tree that
narrowly misses the two.

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:20.160
They fire another rocket, this time taking
down a lamp post.

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:23.060
The two drive through a ditch and destroy
several of the Commando Elite as they crash

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:24.540
and burn into a canal.

00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:27.200
Unbeknownst to them, Chip Hazard is still
alive.

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:30.679
He washes up at a nearby parking lot and sees
the factory creating the Commando Elite toy

00:09:30.679 --> 00:09:31.679
line.

00:09:31.679 --> 00:09:33.860
He has just formed a new plan to retaliate.

00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:36.620
He sneaks into one of the trucks and threatens
Joe with a blade.

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:39.959
By the time Alan and Christy arrive home,
the Fimples are already in a big argument

00:09:39.959 --> 00:09:41.319
with the Abernathys.

00:09:41.319 --> 00:09:44.470
They try to explain the situation to their
parents but they won’t believe them.

00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:47.240
As the Fimples try to leave, Larry and Irwin
arrive.

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:49.769
They confirm what Alan has been alleging all
along.

00:09:49.769 --> 00:09:53.459
Stuart punches Larry in the face and tells
him that his toys almost killed his son.

00:09:53.459 --> 00:09:56.579
On the other hand, Irwin is delighted to see
his designs come alive.

00:09:56.579 --> 00:09:57.970
Suddenly, the lights go off.

00:09:57.970 --> 00:10:00.730
The soldiers have cut off the power supply.

00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:03.910
They spot the toy truck outside the house
and see more Commando Elite soldiers rallying

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:04.910
up.

00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:06.339
They are now in big trouble.

00:10:06.339 --> 00:10:09.489
Archer tells Alan that they have to surrender
because the Gorgonites must lose, it’s what

00:10:09.489 --> 00:10:11.129
they were created to do.

00:10:11.129 --> 00:10:14.639
Phil goes out, waving a white flag of surrender,
but is quickly pushed back into the house

00:10:14.639 --> 00:10:17.569
by the overwhelming number of toys plus their
huge flamethrower.

00:10:17.569 --> 00:10:21.420
The speakers start blasting loud music and
the soldiers aim nails through the window.

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:24.420
The humans and Gorgonites get down as the
living room is trashed.

00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:27.449
They barricade the window and get back but
they soon launch a couple of fireballs into

00:10:27.449 --> 00:10:28.449
the kitchen.

00:10:28.449 --> 00:10:31.379
Alan grabs a curtain and starts dampening
out the fire while the others hide or guard

00:10:31.379 --> 00:10:32.389
the windows.

00:10:32.389 --> 00:10:35.059
Irene grabs a racket as Stuart barricades
the door.

00:10:35.059 --> 00:10:38.589
As they launch more fireballs, Irene tosses
them back with her racket, taking down a few

00:10:38.589 --> 00:10:39.800
of the soldiers.

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:43.600
The group formulates a plan and Irwin reveals
to them the toys’ weakness which is an electromagnetic

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:44.600
pulse.

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:47.369
The only problem is they have to create a
pulse or a field that is big enough to take

00:10:47.369 --> 00:10:48.759
all the toys down.

00:10:48.759 --> 00:10:51.439
The soldiers blow down their fence and bring
in more weapons.

00:10:51.439 --> 00:10:55.209
Alan suggests climbing up to the two transformers
outside and fusing them with a metal tool,

00:10:55.209 --> 00:10:59.220
causing an overload and a magnetic field to
erupt and finally get them rid of the elites.

00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:02.819
As he grabs the tool, Stuart comes in and
begs his son to not go through with it.

00:11:02.819 --> 00:11:06.279
Alan asks him to trust him one more time and
his father eventually gives in.

00:11:06.279 --> 00:11:09.910
The group takes cover and Irene successfully
destroys their fireball launcher.

00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:12.970
Christy sneaks out the back window with Larry
and Irwin so that they can turn on all the

00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:14.129
electronics they own.

00:11:14.129 --> 00:11:17.489
Irene and Phil are forced to share the closets
with Marion and Timmy.

00:11:17.489 --> 00:11:20.860
Meanwhile, Stuart creates a diversion for
the soldiers as Alan runs out.

00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:23.889
They fire a nail gun at them and Stuart gets
hit on the leg.

00:11:23.889 --> 00:11:26.139
The Gorgonites are now faced with a decision.

00:11:26.139 --> 00:11:28.809
They must help defend the humans and fight
their destinies.

00:11:28.809 --> 00:11:32.300
As the father and son prepare to get hit by
nails, the Gorgonites appear to their defense

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:34.639
and start taking out the toys one by one.

00:11:34.639 --> 00:11:37.829
Alan tells Archer that they should prepare
themselves because this force will also fry

00:11:37.829 --> 00:11:38.939
them too.

00:11:38.939 --> 00:11:42.610
Archer tells him to go and Alan makes a run
for it as his father is caught in a net.

00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:46.130
At the Fimples’, Christy calls the police
as the men turn on the electronics.

00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:49.749
Alan has now climbed his way up the electric
pole and comes face to face with Chip Hazard

00:11:49.749 --> 00:11:51.089
who starts firing at him.

00:11:51.089 --> 00:11:55.100
He makes him drop his tool but Chip’s helicopter
malfunctions and the vehicle dives towards

00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:56.509
Phil’s satellite dish.

00:11:56.509 --> 00:12:01.069
As Chip steps on Alan’s fingers, he savors
the moment for his plan is now coming to fulfillment.

00:12:01.069 --> 00:12:04.350
Archer looks up and sees Alan struggling and
fires an arrow to help him.

00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:06.570
He launches into the air right next to Chip.

00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:09.689
A fight ensues and Archer is quickly overtaken
by the soldier.

00:12:09.689 --> 00:12:12.410
Chip pushes Archer off the pole and celebrates
his victory.

00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:16.800
Alan has now gained hold to the pole and grabs
Chip and places him between the transformers.

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:20.540
Chip screams as the transformers fuse and
turns into overload, releasing a large spark

00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:22.619
that sends Alan down to the ground.

00:12:22.619 --> 00:12:25.970
He wakes up and sees the horde of toys coming
towards him and then his savior, Christy with

00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:27.179
the lawnmower.

00:12:27.179 --> 00:12:30.970
She rescues him again just in time as the
transformers explode, letting out a huge magnetic

00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:33.800
field and taking out all the toys almost immediately.

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:37.850
When morning comes, the police and an ambulance
arrive as well as security from the Globotech

00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:38.850
company.

00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:42.720
As the families clean up the mess, a helicopter
arrives and Gil Mars approaches them.

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:45.879
He gives them cheques as compensation for
the damage and in an effort to avoid being

00:12:45.879 --> 00:12:46.879
sued.

00:12:46.879 --> 00:12:50.239
Alan takes the time to apologize to Joe for
what he put him through, but Joe forgives

00:12:50.239 --> 00:12:51.239
him.

00:12:51.239 --> 00:12:54.300
This doesn’t make Alan feel any better who’s
still looking for the Gorgonites.

00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:57.749
On the upside, he’s got a new girlfriend
now and he gives Christy another kiss after

00:12:57.749 --> 00:12:59.179
everything they’ve been through.

00:12:59.179 --> 00:13:02.680
A few hours later, Alan is still cleaning
up the mess in the yard.

00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:05.649
He finds Archer’s bow and then lifts up
Phil’s satellite dish.

00:13:05.649 --> 00:13:08.559
To his surprise, he finds the Gorgonites alive
and well.

00:13:08.559 --> 00:13:10.199
They have survived the blast.

00:13:10.199 --> 00:13:13.630
The Gorgonites celebrate their victory and
for once aren’t feeling like losers.

00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:17.389
Alan soon takes them to a river by the woods
and gives them his dad’s toy boat.

00:13:17.389 --> 00:13:21.029
Now that the Gorgonites are free, they must
sail on to find their own Isle of Gorgon.

00:13:21.029 --> 00:13:32.540
Alan pushes the boat into the water and bids
goodbye to his friends.
