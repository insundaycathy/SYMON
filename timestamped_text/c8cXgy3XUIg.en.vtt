00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:16.720
Hi guys, Korean Movie Recapped here. Before we&nbsp;
start, WARNING! Spoilers Ahead! Today, I’m going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:22.480
to recap a 2020 Korean Crime-Thriller movie called&nbsp;
Deliver Us From Evil. An assassin just finished&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:28.080
his last contract and is about to retire. Little&nbsp;
does he know; a tragedy awaits him at the end of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:34.480
his mission. Can he fulfill his retirement plan?
The story starts with In-nam, who is a Korean&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.280
Intelligence Agent. For some reason, the&nbsp;
higher-up at the Korean Intelligence Agency&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.680
is trying to wipe out his team after confidential&nbsp;
information about a black-ops mission was leaked&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.640
to the public. His chief, Chun-sung, asked&nbsp;
In-nam to leave the country to survive.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.240
At the time, In-nam was in love with a Korean&nbsp;
girl named Young-ju, but he was commanded to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:59.680
fly without her. He goes to Young-ju to say his&nbsp;
goodbye to her before he leaves for good. A group&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.800
of agents follows him to exterminate him, but he&nbsp;
fends them off and successfully runs away abroad.&nbsp;

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.920
Eight years later, In-nam works as an assassin&nbsp;
that kills criminals for money in japan.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.720
His current target is the Director of the&nbsp;
Tokyo Branch of the Kanto Organization,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:20.400
Koreda. He is a vicious man that has killed more&nbsp;
than just a couple of women. No other assassin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.040
was willing to take the mission, but In-nam&nbsp;
managed to execute the contract flawlessly.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.840
He then meets his contractor to get his&nbsp;
payment. The contractor offers him another task,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.400
but he declines. He already decided to&nbsp;
retire after the last mission was done.&nbsp;

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:40.240
He goes to an underground bank to deposit his&nbsp;
money, then enjoys his time off at a restaurant.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.360
At the restaurant, he thinks about&nbsp;
what he should do after he retires.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.320
He is a wanted man back in Korea, and his&nbsp;
track record as an assassin makes him can’t&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.880
enjoy retirement like an average person. A&nbsp;
picture of a beautiful beach hanging on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.200
restaurant wall makes him decide to head out to&nbsp;
Panama and hides there for the rest of his life.&nbsp;

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.760
Meanwhile, Young-ju, In-nam’s ex-lover, lives&nbsp;
happily in Thailand with her daughter, Yoo-min.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:08.880
She drops her daughter at her school and tells&nbsp;
her that a babysitter will fetch her after school,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:14.240
then she heads to work. Some real estate agents&nbsp;
offer her a good deal, but she is hesitant as the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.280
deal is too good to be true. After school,&nbsp;
as Yoo-min gets down from the school bus,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.480
the babysitter takes her away with&nbsp;
her husband instead of going home.&nbsp;

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.680
After Young-ju realizes that her daughter&nbsp;
is missing, she reports to the police,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.040
then contacts Chun-sung, to get her ex-lover&nbsp;
help. Chung-sung pretends to not know In-nam's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.760
whereabouts, thinking that the situation is not&nbsp;
dire as she also doesn’t explain the kidnapping&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:43.200
situation to him. Suddenly, Young-ju receives&nbsp;
a phone call from someone she seems to know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.840
telling her that he found her daughter. That man&nbsp;
tells her to come immediately without noticing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.120
the police and pay the kidnapper the ransom money&nbsp;
for the safety of Yoo-min. Chung-sun then calls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.160
In-nam to say to him that Young-ju is looking for&nbsp;
him. He rejects it and tells him to say that he’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:03.280
already dead if she asks again. He doesn’t want&nbsp;
to be involved with his old life, not only for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.800
his own good but for the safety of his loved one&nbsp;
too. But to his surprise, on the following day,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.960
In-nam receives a message from Chun-sung,&nbsp;
telling him that Young-ju is found dead.&nbsp;

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:18.480
In-nam immediately goes back to Korea to see&nbsp;
Young-ju's body. The authorities tell him that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.280
the local Thailand police found her body near&nbsp;
a pier. They only found the picture of a little&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.080
girl inside her wallet, which they used to track&nbsp;
her identity and send her body back to Korea.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:34.320
As he opens the wallet, he sees Yo-min’s face for&nbsp;
the first time. In-nam then visits Chun-sung to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.840
ask about the little girl and subsequently&nbsp;
discovers that Yoo-min is his daughter.&nbsp;

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:44.480
A new face has entered the stage. Ray the Butcher&nbsp;
is an infamous vicious killer in Japan. It turns&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.520
out that Ray is Koreda’s close friend. They are&nbsp;
so close that he considers Koreda as his brother.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.640
In-nam gets a call from his ex-contractor in&nbsp;
Japan to warn him about Ray as he is seeking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.600
revenge on the ones involved in the murder of&nbsp;
Koraeda. Just after the phone call is finished,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:05.360
a car rams the contractor’s taxi. After he gains&nbsp;
consciousness, he finds himself strapped to a bed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.480
Without any effort, the kidnapers are&nbsp;
able to get In-nam’s location from him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.280
He thinks that if he cooperates with them,&nbsp;
Ray will let him go. But when Ray comes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:20.320
he ties him upside down and butchers him anyway.&nbsp;
Knowing that the hitman that assassinated his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.840
brother is in Korea, Ray heads there immediately.
In-nam gets information from Chun-sung about a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.880
man that lives in Bangkok called Lee, who can help&nbsp;
him investigate the truth behind Young-ju’s death.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:36.320
So he heads to Bangkok. Unfortunately,&nbsp;
on the same day, Ray manages to get to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:41.600
Chun-sung. He finds a poster of the missing&nbsp;
Yoo-min and decides to head to Bangkok too.&nbsp;

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.600
In Bangkok, In-nam meets Lee and pays&nbsp;
him to help with the investigation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:50.640
Lee had already dug out some information and&nbsp;
found out that the real estate agent Young-ju&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:54.800
worked with is a wanted fraudster and possibly&nbsp;
the one who has set up the kidnapping of Yoo-min.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.520
After that, In-nam tracks down the real&nbsp;
estate agent and follows him around.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:05.040
He manages to kidnap him and then tortures him to&nbsp;
get a confession, which he confesses to setting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:09.600
up the kidnapping to get the ransom money from&nbsp;
Young-ju. But he doesn’t know the whereabouts of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:14.880
Yoo-min now as the babysitter and her husband took&nbsp;
her. But it might be too late as the babysitter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:19.760
said that they would kill Yoo-min. After the&nbsp;
real estate guy spilt all his schemes, In-nam&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:23.840
finishes him and starts to track the babysitter&nbsp;
to at least retrieve his daughter’s body.

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:28.000
Meanwhile, Ray the Butcher&nbsp;
has arrived in Bangkok too.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.160
He employs a local gangster group to help him&nbsp;
track Yoo-min from the poster to get to In-nam.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.720
But the local gangster betrays him for the&nbsp;
money, which is a big mistake for them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.680
Ray single-handedly wipes the whole gang and&nbsp;
forces the last member to track Yoo-min down.&nbsp;

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:46.400
With his skill as an assassin, tracking&nbsp;
the babysitter is not a big deal for him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:51.680
As he tortures the husband, the babysitter tells&nbsp;
him that Yoo-min is still alive and has been sold&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:57.120
to the Chaopo crime syndicate. The news rekindles&nbsp;
hope inside In-nam as there is still a chance to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:01.600
save his daughter. He goes back to Lee to get&nbsp;
more information about the Chaopo syndicate.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:07.280
It turns out that it’s a big drug syndicate that&nbsp;
also do human trafficking as their side business.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:12.000
Lee then introduces Yui, a Korean&nbsp;
Shemale that works in Thailand’s club.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.120
With her help, In-nam plans to infiltrate the&nbsp;
Chaopo hideout, disguised as a buyer looking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:22.640
for a Korean child to harvest their organs.
With the translation help from Yui, they manage&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:27.280
to get inside and see a bunch of children in&nbsp;
the hideout. But Yoo-min is nowhere to be found.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:32.400
They find out that someone has already bought&nbsp;
her. In-nam offers them as much as they want to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:38.160
outbid the current buyer. The trafficker lady&nbsp;
tells them to wait outside. But after a while,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:42.560
In-nam decides to go inside and breaks the&nbsp;
locked room to ask the children about Yoo-min.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:48.080
One of the children recognizes Yoo-min’s photo&nbsp;
and tells them that she is on the way to surgery.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:52.880
Before he manages to dig for more information,&nbsp;
the gang’s henchmen realize something is wrong&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:57.920
and confront them. In-nam easily beats them and&nbsp;
forces the trafficker lady to tell him Yoo-min’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:03.040
location. It turns out that they transferred&nbsp;
Yoo-min to a nearby province to conduct surgery&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:08.000
to harvest her heart, but she doesn’t know&nbsp;
the exact location. Suddenly, the previous&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.560
boy tells him the exact location as it turns out&nbsp;
that he had his kidney extracted there as well.&nbsp;

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:17.200
The trafficker lady runs, but she&nbsp;
doesn’t get far as Ray intercepts her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:22.240
The situation quickly becomes dire as now&nbsp;
In-nam must face the infamous Ray the Butcher.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:25.680
In-nam tells Yui to run away with&nbsp;
the boy while he tries to hold Ray.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:30.560
They have a fierce fight for a while, but&nbsp;
he manages to lock himself in a room then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:36.240
escapes from the window, down to the street. Ray&nbsp;
tries to catch up, but he loses In-nam’s track.&nbsp;

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:41.920
Meanwhile, Yui successfully runs away with the&nbsp;
boy, but for some reason, the police detain her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:46.880
Seeing it, In-nam doesn’t have any other&nbsp;
choice besides leaving them for now.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:51.440
By night, the police have swarmed the&nbsp;
building, cracking down the trafficker hideout.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:55.360
The Chaopo’s henchmen assess the situation&nbsp;
and report it back to their leader,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:55.360 --> 00:08:00.640
Lan. The situation becomes more ugly as the&nbsp;
Chaopo Syndicate is hunting In-nam too now.

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:06.160
In-nam evaluates the situation with Lee to&nbsp;
plan their next move. They manage to locate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:12.080
the location of Chaopo’s factory. But something is&nbsp;
making Lee nervous. He tells In-nam that Ray has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:17.280
killed Chun-sung and got his phone. They need&nbsp;
to act carefully. But instead of doing that,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:22.560
In-nam calls Chun-sung's phone to warn Ray to&nbsp;
stop the hunt. He promises him that if he does not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:28.080
stop, he will end him. Ray accepts the challenge&nbsp;
and also promises to kill everyone he cares about.&nbsp;

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:33.840
Meanwhile, Yui is still inside the jail. The&nbsp;
police interrogate her to find out what happened&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:39.120
at the trafficker hideout. At first, Yui shuts&nbsp;
her mouth, but when the police threaten to give&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:43.440
her to the Chaopo syndicate, she tells them&nbsp;
that In-nam is going to the Chaopo’s factory&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:49.040
in a nearby province. When In-nam arrives at&nbsp;
the location, he realizes that Yoo-min is held&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:54.320
captive inside a football factory. He scouts the&nbsp;
surroundings and is able to see her from a window.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:54.880 --> 00:09:00.400
Not long after that, In-nam sees Yoo-min being&nbsp;
taken away from the football factory for surgery.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:05.600
He chases them to a nearby clinic, but suddenly&nbsp;
Ray appears on a tuk-tuk, fully equipped with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:10.800
heavy weaponry to kill him. In-nam is forced&nbsp;
to run for now as Ray is chasing him. But he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:15.760
doesn’t have much time to play with Ray. The&nbsp;
doctors inside the clinic are already preparing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:21.280
Yoo-min for the surgery. The situation becomes&nbsp;
more out of control when the SWAT team arrives.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:26.960
But thanks to them, In-nam can sneak out of the&nbsp;
situation as the police keep Ray busy. He rushes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:31.200
to the clinic and manages to kill the doctor&nbsp;
just before they are about to start the surgery.&nbsp;

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:37.200
Now that his daughter is safe, he contacts Lee to&nbsp;
arrange an escape route to Panama. Lee gives him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:42.080
a contact of a smuggler that can help him get out&nbsp;
of the country. Lee himself is also running away&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:47.600
as Ray is getting closer. This event made Chaopo’s&nbsp;
operations in that province subsequently busted.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:52.880
It turns out that some of the police are working&nbsp;
with the Chaopo syndicate. They hold a meeting to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:58.560
discuss the situation when suddenly Ray barges in&nbsp;
to demand an audience with the leader, Lan. Having&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:03.840
a common goal, they decide to group up, under the&nbsp;
condition that Lan will be the one to kill him.&nbsp;

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:08.400
When Yoo-min regains consciousness, In-nam&nbsp;
tries to talk to her, but she doesn’t speak&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:13.120
a single word. He calls Yui to help him with&nbsp;
Yoo-min and tells her to meet them at a hotel.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:18.960
Yui hesitates but agrees anyway. In-nam brings&nbsp;
Yoo-min to a clothing shop to dress her up,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:23.360
then goes to the agreed-upon hotel. He is&nbsp;
worried about the condition of Yoo-min and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:28.160
calls for a paediatrician. The paediatrician&nbsp;
checks her, but she is completely healthy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:32.320
He tries to talk once again with&nbsp;
her and shows her a magic trick.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:35.600
It makes Yoo-min remember the magic&nbsp;
trick that her mother used to show her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:40.560
She finally opens up to him as he promises&nbsp;
her that he will protect her no matter what.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:45.280
He hugs her and leaves her with the paediatrician&nbsp;
for a while to meet with the smuggler. He goes to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:49.120
a nearby market to meet with the smuggler then&nbsp;
pays them to bring them out of the country.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:55.440
When he returns to the hotel, he notices some men&nbsp;
are already waiting for him. He rushes back to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:55.440 --> 00:11:00.640
room but gets stabbed a couple of times along&nbsp;
the way. When he opens the door, Ray is already&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:07.040
waiting for him. They bash In-nam's head, making&nbsp;
him unconscious. Unexpectedly, Ray kills Lan’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:11.760
men because he wants to kill In-nam himself.
Yui is waiting in the parking lot when she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:17.680
sees Ray’s men dragging In-nam. She acts fast&nbsp;
and uses her car to ram them, setting him free.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:22.960
Yoo-min is in another car with Ray, so In-nam&nbsp;
runs to chase them. He manages to intercept&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:28.320
them and shoots Ray in his shoulder. He jumps&nbsp;
to the car like a badass and strangles Ray.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:34.560
The car crashes as they continue to brawl. In-nam&nbsp;
realizes that Yoo-min is inside a suitcase. Ray&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:39.600
catches him off guard and stabs him. Running&nbsp;
out of options, he set off one of Ray’s Grenade.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:46.240
The explosion shook them, but all of them managed&nbsp;
to survive. Yui comes and brings Yoo-min away. As&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:51.040
he sees them running away to safety, he sets&nbsp;
off another grenade, killing himself and ray.&nbsp;

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:58.480
Yoo-min is now safe with Yui. They go to&nbsp;
a locker and find a bag left by In-nam.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:03.840
The bag is full of cash and the documents&nbsp;
they need to live a peaceful life in Panama.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:07.920
Yoo-min and Yui then set off to Panama&nbsp;
to fulfill In-nam’s retirement plan.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:13.200
She lives happily with Yui, without her mother’s&nbsp;
warm hand, and her father’s lovely smile.&nbsp;
