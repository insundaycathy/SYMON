00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.560
﻿If you made every wrong decision possible&nbsp;
when a hurricane was hitting your home,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.840
what would you do?
In this How to Beat video, we’ll follow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:12.880
the Kellers, see if we can make better decisions,&nbsp;
and ultimately attempt to beat the ALLIGATORS in,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.720
CRAWL. If you think you have a better way, let&nbsp;
me know in the comments! If you like these how to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.840

We start out following Haley, competing at a swim&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.720
meet in Florida. Oh man, I know what this is.&nbsp;
They are showing us that she’s a competitive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.760
swimmer as a form of narrative framing in an&nbsp;
attempt to make it somewhat believable when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.480
she inevitably outswims an alligator later in&nbsp;
the movie. But it’s not going to fool me.
&nbsp;

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.880
All you need to do is take 5 seconds to&nbsp;
Google, “How fast can alligators swim”,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.440
and you’ll come up with 20 miles per hour on&nbsp;
average. To put how fucked she would be in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:51.600
perspective, Michael Phelps peaks at a meager 6&nbsp;
miles per hour. Good luck outswimming something&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.240
over 3 times as fast as Michael Phelps.&nbsp;
That’s like you trying to outswim another&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:02.000
human sprinting on land. Not going to happen.
Alligators are not to be underestimated on land&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.800
either. They may seem like slow and lethargic&nbsp;
beasts that just float around in the water,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.360
but when they decide to strike they can&nbsp;
be shockingly quick. Humans can run about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:17.360
20 miles per hour on average, and a gator can&nbsp;
only manage half that for very short distances.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.960
But. They are dangerous because they have&nbsp;
ludicrous mode levels of acceleration and can get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:29.120
up to that 10 miles per hour in the blink of an&nbsp;
eye. They’re ambush predators afterall. Basically,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.120
if you aren’t paying attention to an&nbsp;
alligator that’s 20 or 30 feet away,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:38.720
it’ll probably catch you. There are videos of&nbsp;
alligators catching cheetahs. One of the fastest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:48.160
animals on the planet. Cheetahs can go 0-60 in 3&nbsp;
seconds. If they can’t get away I don’t think your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:54.240
average American stands a chance. Oh and to top it&nbsp;
all off, they can climb trees and fences too.
&nbsp;

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.800
Why are we even suggesting or considering&nbsp;
that Haley could outswim a gator when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:10.320
she can’t even beat other people.
I’m sure this arrogance will fuel some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.160
bad decision making. Look i’m not saying&nbsp;
we aren’t at the top of the food chain,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.880
but nature can be a merciless vicious bitch&nbsp;
if you swim outside of your lane.
&nbsp;

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:24.720
Back in the locker room Haley just now realizes&nbsp;
that a category 5 hurricane is about to hit them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:31.920
and mandatory evacuations are underway. Category 5&nbsp;
hurricanes can have winds exceeding 175 miles per&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.680
hour and storm surges above 20 feet. Houses get&nbsp;
ripped off their foundations and float down the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.080
street at these levels, and you just now heard&nbsp;
about it and shrugged it off like it was just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.120
a light tropical storm passing through? 
Haley was probably too distracted playing Raid:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.840
Shadow Legends to realize that the hurricane’s&nbsp;
path shifted towards her. You too, can get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:57.040
dangerously immersed in Raid, exploring millions&nbsp;
of Champion combinations and mastering countless&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:02.720
tactics as you take on raid bosses, dungeon runs,&nbsp;
campaign battles, and PvP Arena matches.
&nbsp;

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.840
There are 16 different factions, such as Orcs,&nbsp;
High Elves, Dark elves, Dwarves, and each faction&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:13.120
has many unique champions. With over 500 champions&nbsp;
total, you can build your team, develop your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.320
Champions, and Raid until your power goes and you&nbsp;
realize everyone in your town was evacuated.

&nbsp;

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.840
Later in the movie I theorize that these Crawl&nbsp;
alligators were being bred for intelligence and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.080
aggression. They are basically the precursors&nbsp;
to Broadmaw and Gator from The Lizardmen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.560
faction. These behemoths evolved to walk&nbsp;
on their hind legs and use weapons and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.240
armor. Haley and Dave are lucky their gators&nbsp;
haven’t evolved into these bio-tanks yet.
&nbsp;

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.880
Raid recently released its biggest ever&nbsp;
update, the Doom Tower. It’s a giant tower&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:50.400
with 120 floors, a bunch of Secret Challenge&nbsp;
Rooms, and 12 badass Bosses to take on. 
&nbsp;

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.040
There’s a bunch of new Champions and events coming&nbsp;
this month, including special Valentine’s Day&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.960
events, so now’s a great time to get started.
Click the link in the description to get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:07.040
50,000 silver, 50 gems, 1 energy refill, 1 clan&nbsp;
boss key, 5 mystery shards, 1 day xp booster,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:12.160
and 1 free champion, Hexweaver. But only if you’re&nbsp;
a new player and only for the next 30 days.
&nbsp;

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.720
All this treasure will be waiting for you here.&nbsp;
Good luck, you probably will need it.
&nbsp;

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.600
On one hand it’s tempting to be super critical&nbsp;
of her for being so careless and nonchalant,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.680
on the other hand, I ignore tornado&nbsp;
warnings because come on, what are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.560
the chances it actually hits me.. 
But, back on the first hand, hurricanes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.360
are arguably far more dangerous. A tornado&nbsp;
is likely just going to destroy a mobile&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:40.880
home park in bumfuck Missouri, whereas a hurricane&nbsp;
will wipe out entire regions of coastline states.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.240
I’d say she has a lot more reason&nbsp;
to be worried than I ever do. 
&nbsp;

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:49.920
In U.S. history, the worst Hurricane caused 10&nbsp;
times the damage that the worst tornado did. Oh,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:55.600
and she lives in Florida where alligators&nbsp;
eat people, so yah, I feel justified and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:01.040
in no way a hypocrite for condemning Haley whilst&nbsp;
habitually ignoring natural disasters myself.
&nbsp;

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.080
A rogue wave from the hurricane&nbsp;
hasn’t even broken through,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.720
and they are already losing track of each other.&nbsp;
From what I cared to overhear on their phone call,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:19.280
the family is fractured from divorce and&nbsp;
animosity. They’re all somewhat repulsed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:24.880
by each other, yet simultaneously share a strong&nbsp;
tether of kinship. Their relationships with each&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:30.320
other are all very complicated and stupid. Which&nbsp;
is why Haley hopped into her jeep to hunt down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:37.840
her dad that she hasn’t talked to in forever,&nbsp;
because he went no contact on her sister.
&nbsp;

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:43.680
That’s only when it’s a Sharknado.
Haley gets held up at a blockade where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:47.520
they’re telling everyone to turn around because&nbsp;
the Hurricane is heading straight towards them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:52.480
It’s already getting pretty bad out by now. It’s&nbsp;
tempting to head back but she looks at her phone.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:57.520
Her dad’s face on it pulling her heartstrings.&nbsp;
She can’t leave, not without him.
&nbsp;

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.760
With the confidence a jeep instills, and&nbsp;
her above average swimming capabilities,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:05.760
she boldly decides to go head on into the&nbsp;
mouth of the hurricane to find him.
&nbsp;

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:10.640
Why didn’t he board up his home? It’s common&nbsp;
practice and this guy is a home contractor.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:14.800
Though it might be asking too much from&nbsp;
him considering he doesn’t understand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:19.920
how to operate a phone or read the news.
This family screwed up on a bunch of things way&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:24.480
earlier on. Florida is one of the most&nbsp;
hurricane-prone places you could live,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:27.280
they definitely should have&nbsp;
had a plan in place already. 
&nbsp;

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:32.160
Usually you have days of notice before a hurricane&nbsp;
hits unless your head is in the ground, so there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:36.560
should be plenty of time to do what you need to&nbsp;
do and get out in time. The Kellers have money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:40.960
and transportation, so there is no reason they&nbsp;
should be staying instead of evacuating. 
&nbsp;

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:45.600
They should have checked in on each other,&nbsp;
in person if necessary, before the hurricane&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:51.040
showed up. This last minute, oh a hurricane is&nbsp;
making landfall and I don’t know where my dad is,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:54.880
shit is.. Probably more realistic&nbsp;
than i’d like to admit.
&nbsp;

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:00.160
After getting a proper headcount they should&nbsp;
have made sure that their valuables and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:04.960
important documents are either collected or&nbsp;
stored in bolted down waterproof containers,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:09.600
preferably in the attic. Their cars&nbsp;
are stocked up with emergency supplies,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:13.520
have gas and are in good shape. Their&nbsp;
electricity and gas to the house are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:17.920
shut off so it doesn’t flood and burn down&nbsp;
at the same time, which would really suck.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:22.720
As well as storm shutters installed over the&nbsp;
windows with any weak points reinforced.
&nbsp;

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:26.160
But most importantly, they need to&nbsp;
have firearms or chainsaws on hand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:30.000
just in case sharks start taking flight&nbsp;
in the 150 mile and hour winds.. 
&nbsp;

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:40.320
In all seriousness, wouldn’t sharks swimming in&nbsp;
the floodwaters be a big problem? Florida does&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:44.960
have a lot of sharks on it’s coast which attack&nbsp;
and eat the occasional person who swims out too&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:50.800
far. Turns out, not really. Sharks have an organ&nbsp;
called the lateral line that can sense pressure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:56.320
changes indicative of impending hurricanes. When&nbsp;
they sense these pressure changes they swim to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:02.240
deeper water to avoid getting washed ashore into&nbsp;
some retiree’s beachside pool or stuck flapping&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:07.120
on the highway when the tide pulls out.
Well what about the 1.3 million alligators&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:12.080
that live all throughout Florida? Doesn’t&nbsp;
this have potential to form a gator-nado,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:19.120
or a gator-iccane, gator-cane? Again, not&nbsp;
really. Attacks in Florida are very rare,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:26.080
with 24 confirmed fatal alligator attacks&nbsp;
since 1973. I'd bet most of those deaths&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:29.760
were caused by idiots trying to feed&nbsp;
or take up-close pictures of them.
&nbsp;

00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:38.800
Despite their walnut sized brain, they aren’t&nbsp;
stupid when it comes to weathering storms either.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:42.320
Like sharks, they detect the pressure&nbsp;
changes of an impending hurricane and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:46.640
hunker down in their natural habitats.
Doesn’t mean they can’t end up in your backyard&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:49.920
due to massive flooding though.
Or find them in your dining room.
&nbsp;

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:54.720
These sorts of situations are statistically&nbsp;
rare enough that it’d be reasonable for Haley&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:59.520
to not really expect a similar encounter.
Still, having firearms for defense during natural&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:05.120
disaster situations isn’t a bad idea. Besides&nbsp;
potential encounters with predatory wildlife,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:09.200
there are lots of opportunists and criminals&nbsp;
that would take advantage of the chaos. Never&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:14.160
hurts to have some big iron on your hip. 
No sign of him at the condo, his truck is gone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:19.520
too so he must be out somewhere else. Unless this&nbsp;
dude is a complete psychopath, he wouldn’t just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:24.160
leave Sugar behind. She could wait for him to&nbsp;
come back, but the lack of storm shutters and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:29.920
emergency supplies, the unanswered calls, the half&nbsp;
drunk bottle of bourbon on the table, all suggest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:34.640
this dude got snapped up. If he was going to get&nbsp;
supplies, he should have done it days ago. 
&nbsp;

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:37.840
Knowing about their other house from&nbsp;
the divorce, it’s likely he would be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:42.400
there doing something. He sure as hell isn’t on&nbsp;
the job right now. Haley should leave a note,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:46.240
grab Sugar, and head to their old house&nbsp;
immediately while sending Beth an update.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:51.280
Or she could instead take a stroll down memory&nbsp;
lane and reminisce about a time when she actually&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:56.880
won swim competitions and had a strong loving&nbsp;
father-daughter relationship. Did she all of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:01.520
sudden forget that a category five hurricane is&nbsp;
about to rain hell on them and that her dad is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:10.080
potentially in a life-threatening condition?
No, shit. It’s because everyone evacuated,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:15.040
because there’s a hurricane. Finally she wises&nbsp;
up and heads to their old house leftover from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:19.920
the divorce. At least Haley is providing text&nbsp;
updates. If something bad happens to her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:24.240
which is increasingly likely with the&nbsp;
cat 5 hurricane arriving in force by now,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:29.280
Beth will at least have a last known location she&nbsp;
can send to rescuers once the storm passes.
&nbsp;

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:33.600
His truck ‘is’ here, which is a good sign&nbsp;
because we know he didn’t get swept into a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:39.040
flooded ravine while trying to escape. If that&nbsp;
was the case, well, there would be no finding&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:43.520
him and with how ferocious these alligators&nbsp;
are he would certainly be dead meat.
&nbsp;

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:47.760
None of these people bothered to board up the&nbsp;
windows or even shut the doors to their house&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:51.600
either. What are they even doing? 
There’s no sign of her dad so far.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:56.000
Haley calls his phone one more time,&nbsp;
and not only is the ringtone volume on,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.880
but it has cell service, received multiple&nbsp;
messages from concerned family members,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:05.840
and had evacuation alerts. If only&nbsp;
he put his phone in his pocket.
&nbsp;

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:09.760
Speaking of, why do older folks not keep&nbsp;
their phone on them most of the time?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:14.000
Your phone is about as useful as a rock if you&nbsp;
don’t have it on you. Yah yah, they don’t feel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.160
the need to be connected at all times like an&nbsp;
addicted millennial would, but at least keep it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:23.360
on you during a fucking natural disaster.
Haley’s investigation continues, as she spots a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:28.160
bunch of tools next to the sink. Don’t tell me&nbsp;
he was doing some last minute plumbing. Could&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:32.240
the screenwriters really not think of a better&nbsp;
reason he’d be missing and unconscious. 
&nbsp;

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:40.240
That’s why you board up the windows, in case you&nbsp;
were wondering. And the garage door is up too.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:43.520
Does Barry not understand the&nbsp;
concept of shutting doors?
&nbsp;

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:49.120
Like a good doggo, Sugar alerts Haley to the&nbsp;
crawl space entrance. As stupid as it seems,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:53.520
all clues are pointing to him being down&nbsp;
there. With the mud, dead animals, debris,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:58.320
and god knows what else down there, I’d think&nbsp;
taking a minute to put some gloves, proper pants&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:02.720
and shoes on would be wise. I gotta believe&nbsp;
she still has some old clothes here. Or you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:12.640
could just go for it in capris and sandals.
I know it’s your dad and all, but if he really&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:17.280
is down here, he’s definitely a candidate&nbsp;
for a Darwin award. At some point you just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:20.960
have to cut the dead weight off, like&nbsp;
his wife did when she divorced him.
&nbsp;

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:25.200
Haley keeps trudging onwards, stumbling&nbsp;
into more clues which eventually lead her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:29.680
to Barry lying in the mud unconscious. 
I was really holding out for there being some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:33.680
legitimate reason he’s down here. Or&nbsp;
that he wasn’t down here in the first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:38.560
place but the gator dragged him down here.&nbsp;
Nope. It’s now confirmed. Barry Pepper,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:43.680
during a category 5 hurricane, was in the crawl&nbsp;
space of a house nobody lives in, trying to fix&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:49.520
the plumbing for a sink nobody uses. 
I have. No words. I think we could probably&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:53.920
wrap this video up and say that we could have&nbsp;
beaten the gators in crawl by not being total&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:58.640
fucking idiots. But let’s just continue as&nbsp;
if Barry was doing everything correctly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:04.320
but somehow he was knocked unconscious by a&nbsp;
flying 2x4 and dragged by a gator under the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:09.120
crawl space to feed on him later, where Haley&nbsp;
with her supreme detective work finds him.
&nbsp;

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:16.480
The most obvious animal that would cause&nbsp;
a bite wound like that is an alligator,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:20.320
considering the size of the bite and.. all&nbsp;
the gator signs around their home.
&nbsp;

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:25.520
While alligators aren’t known to attack unprovoked&nbsp;
or prey upon humans, it can still happen if they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:30.400
feel threatened or you enter their nest. Some&nbsp;
alligators may have been washed up to their house&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:35.520
and found a new home in the crawl space. Barry&nbsp;
crawling into their nest probably both threatened&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:39.920
and startled them so they attacked.
Some sources say that alligators are more scared&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:45.120
of humans than we are of them, and that’s why&nbsp;
human attacks are rare. I’m calling BS on that.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:49.120
I’m definitely more scared of them which&nbsp;
is why I stay way out of their reach.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:53.200
These things attack lions. And they’re&nbsp;
scared of us. Yah, okay bro.
&nbsp;

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:57.520
They don’t fuck around when you’re in their&nbsp;
territory. Just go on YouTube or LiveLeak and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:02.160
type in alligator attacks. I still remember&nbsp;
that story of a 2 year old getting snatched&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:06.560
and killed by an alligator at a Disney resort&nbsp;
in Florida. The dad attacked the alligator&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:10.880
but couldn’t stop the alligator from dragging&nbsp;
his son into the lagoon. Truly horrific.
&nbsp;

00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:16.000
While alligators are a serious threat, the bigger&nbsp;
issue is Barry’s current condition worsening.
&nbsp;

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:21.040
Haley did a good job by checking for a pulse and&nbsp;
listening for breathing, and luckily he’s got both&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:26.640
because emergency services won’t be responding.&nbsp;
This isn’t a national guard commercial, no gung-ho&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:31.600
20 year old is going to rappel out of a blackhawk&nbsp;
helicopter in the nick of time just for you. 
&nbsp;

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:35.120
First thing she should do is thoroughly&nbsp;
check the bite wound to ensure that he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:40.000
doesn’t have severe bleeding. An adult male&nbsp;
will die if they lose half a gallon of blood.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.240
Pulse and respiration are worthless if&nbsp;
he’s going to bleed out in 5 to 10 minutes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:47.840
Barry doesn’t appear to be hemorrhaging.&nbsp;
Onto the next potential problem. 
&nbsp;

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:52.640
If the bacterial infection caused by all the&nbsp;
rotting flesh in the gator’s mouth causes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:58.880
septic shock, which it seems to be doing. If he&nbsp;
loses 15-20% of his blood. If his neck, head,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:04.240
chest wall or lungs got injured. If he had&nbsp;
fluid build up in his lungs. Or if anything&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:08.640
else happens that seizes up his respiration&nbsp;
and heart rate, he’s in deep shit.
&nbsp;

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:12.960
If his breathing stopped, she’d have to drag&nbsp;
him out of there and drive through the low flood&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:18.960
waters to the nearest operational hospital while&nbsp;
giving him a rescue breath every 5 to 6 seconds.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:24.560
Even 5 to 10 minutes without oxygen to the brain&nbsp;
can cause serious and irreversible brain damage.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:28.960
I don’t think Haley could effectively do this.&nbsp;
At minimum, Barry would have brain damage,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:32.480
but most likely would be dead.
If his pulse stopped too,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:36.080
doing all that ‘and’ having to give&nbsp;
chest compressions is just not going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:41.440
to be possible. Barry would 100% be dead.
While it looked like the house was situated on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:46.560
a bit of a hill, this hurricane is just kicking&nbsp;
off so flood waters could quickly rise above&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:51.200
it and drown him if she doesn’t get him to high&nbsp;
ground. But that’s just part of the problem. If&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:56.160
the floodwaters reach 3 feet or higher, she won’t&nbsp;
be able to make the drive to a hospital without&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:56.160 --> 00:16:01.200
getting lifted and swept away. That is, unless&nbsp;
you got the keys to one of these bad boys.
&nbsp;

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:06.480
To state the obvious, she needs to get him out of&nbsp;
there ASAP. Which is a lot easier said than done.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:11.200
She needs to be weary of his injuries and not just&nbsp;
yank him which could worsen the situation.
&nbsp;

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:21.760
As an ex-volunteer firefighter who’s practiced&nbsp;
rescue carries and drags, manually dragging a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:26.960
lifeless human that weighs 50 more pounds than&nbsp;
you through debris-filled mud in a confined space&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:33.040
where you can’t stand up at all is very difficult.&nbsp;
And she’s barefooted with muddy hands. Again,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:38.000
maybe slippers weren’t the best choice when&nbsp;
trying to rescue your dad in a hurricane.
&nbsp;

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.840
Since he’s breathing and has a pulse, the&nbsp;
absolute best thing she could do is help&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:46.320
him regain consciousness. He probably passed&nbsp;
out due to the pain of his collar bone being&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:50.880
snapped like a wishbone, the emotional&nbsp;
stress of the attack, loss of blood,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:55.600
dehydration, and possibly septic shock depending&nbsp;
on how long it’s been since the attack.
&nbsp;

00:16:55.600 --> 00:17:00.240
Haley should loosen any constrictive clothing,&nbsp;
lift his legs above his heart level to aid in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:05.200
blood circulation, and get him some water.&nbsp;
Rain water, not that sewage flowing in.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:09.920
They say not to shake and slap someone that passed&nbsp;
out, but I think Barry’s an exception. 
&nbsp;

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:14.400
He ‘should’ regain consciousness and can&nbsp;
then crawl his own dumbass out of there.
&nbsp;

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:18.000
If that doesn’t work, finding a tarp to&nbsp;
put him on will reduce the friction and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:23.680
make dragging him substantially easier. Which she&nbsp;
conveniently has nearby. Good thinking Haley.
&nbsp;

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:28.640
Welp ladies and gents, I think we did it. I&nbsp;
think we successfully saved Barry Pepper from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:33.280
drowning and getting eaten by alligators. Just&nbsp;
a few more steps and we can get him in the car&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:45.840
and take him to a hospital where he can get sewed&nbsp;
up, take some antibiotics and be good as new.
&nbsp;

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:52.560
Oh come on. An alligator isn’t going to bust&nbsp;
through a wooden staircase like the kool aid man.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:57.280
Haley is lucky this alligator already has a&nbsp;
belly full of human meat, because they can move&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:01.760
way faster than that. Remember, these&nbsp;
things can pounce cheetahs. Haley trying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:06.640
to pull 180 pounds of dead weight in the mud&nbsp;
with her bare hands and feet is a joke.
&nbsp;

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:12.480
If she can’t run, literally, what options does&nbsp;
she have? What should anyone do when confronted&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:17.920
by an alligator like this. Well, basically&nbsp;
what she did, as futile as it would be. 
&nbsp;

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:21.840
Unloading a Benelli M4 full of&nbsp;
slugs into its face is your best&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:27.440
bet. Crawling away as quickly as possible is your&nbsp;
second best bet. You can’t puff your chest out,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:32.320
make loud noises, or play dead with gators.
Your only chance to survive is to fight back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:37.120
before it catches you and starts death rolling&nbsp;
you, and the only weakness you can realistically&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:42.800
exploit is gouging it’s eyes. The problem with&nbsp;
this strat, is that it’s eyes are located behind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:47.120
it’s giant pissed off mouth. I’m starting to&nbsp;
think the internet is bullshitting us about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:52.800
how to defend against an alligator attack. 
If you, a tuk tuk driver making an oil delivery..&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:57.040
For some reason just go with me here,&nbsp;
rounded the corner of a backstreet and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:57.040 --> 00:19:02.080
were confronted with an American Abrams tank,&nbsp;
according to the internet, you should try to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:07.200
board it and spray paint it’s optics while it’s&nbsp;
trying to crush you under it’s treads. Unless&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:12.880
you’re Dominic Toretto, that ain’t happenin.
Yah let me juke it’s business end, baseball slide&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:18.560
up next to it, board the prehistoric monster like&nbsp;
a fucking bull rider, thumb it’s eyeballs before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:24.400
it rolls it’s 800 pounds of weight onto you, then&nbsp;
dismount the writhing pissed off beast without its&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:30.400
tail sweeping your legs and shattering them into a&nbsp;
hundred pieces. What could possibly go wrong.
&nbsp;

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:33.280
Then again, They don’t really&nbsp;
have any other options. 
&nbsp;

00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:38.800
If it did explode towards them and bite down on&nbsp;
his legs with it’s 3000 pounds per square inch of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:43.840
jaw strength, it will crush his femurs and it’s&nbsp;
inch and a half to 2 inch long teeth will sink&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:48.800
deep into his flesh, enough to potentially&nbsp;
sever arteries. If that didn’t wake him up,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:52.960
I don’t know what would. With that kind of jaw&nbsp;
strength, it’s impossible to pry it’s mouth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:58.480
open and get free. If there’s water nearby it’ll&nbsp;
immediately drag him into it and death roll him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:03.840
until he drowns. If there’s no water nearby, it’ll&nbsp;
just roll him on the ground until he dies..
&nbsp;

00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:08.560
Once a gator starts death rolling you, it’s&nbsp;
pretty much over. It is called death rolling for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:13.920
a reason. It disorients you, knocks the air out&nbsp;
of you, breaks your bones, rips your limbs off,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:18.960
and the power and speed of the thrashing makes&nbsp;
it near impossible to use whatever non-ripped&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:23.280
off limbs you have left to fight back.
This would all happen in a few seconds.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:27.840
The gator would then take his lifeless body&nbsp;
back to it’s den where it would wait for his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:34.560
corpse to start rotting before tearing pieces&nbsp;
off to eat. Gator don’t play no shit.
&nbsp;

00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:39.200
With no Benelli on hand, I think she&nbsp;
should just drop her dad and use him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:44.640
as a tasty distraction so she can escape with&nbsp;
Sugar. Haley’s much more merciful than I am,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:48.480
summons some adrenaline strength and starts&nbsp;
hauling Barry back the way she came.
&nbsp;

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:52.720
Her wardrobe continues to malfunction,&nbsp;
and her phone falls out of her capri pants&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:56.320
fashionably small pockets. She really&nbsp;
didn’t think this outfit through.
&nbsp;

00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:03.040
This dude even had a radio telling him&nbsp;
a hurricane was coming while he was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:08.480
plumbing in the crawl space. Jesus christ.
Haley pulls Barry back to where she found him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:12.320
which was conveniently blocked off just&nbsp;
enough for them to get through but not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:16.800
the gator. I’m surprised she remembered how&nbsp;
to get back in this maze of crawl space with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:20.400
a gator snapping at her dad's feet.
The gator isn’t the only thing they need&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:24.800
to worry about, that hurricane that nobody&nbsp;
seems to give a shit about is picking up. 
&nbsp;

00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:29.600
Dave, yah i’ll start using his real name&nbsp;
now, is just now regaining consciousness,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:34.160
‘after’ pulling him out of the gators&nbsp;
jaws. Good timing bro. Take your time.
&nbsp;

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:38.320
Soaking the jacket to get him some water&nbsp;
is pretty clever. Haley is scoring about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:42.720
a 7/10 right now. I had to knock some&nbsp;
points off for the slippers and capris,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:46.560
but she’s been pretty resourceful. Must have&nbsp;
gotten more of her mothers genetics.
&nbsp;

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:54.720
Of course he would say something like that, being&nbsp;
a dumbass is perfectly on brand. He then says,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:59.520
“what’s happening with this storm”, oh, you&nbsp;
mean the category 5 hurricane you completely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:04.160
disregarded? Yah, it’s getting pretty bad.&nbsp;
I liked this guy better unconscious.
&nbsp;

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:08.480
To be fair, he’s probably in a bit&nbsp;
of shock, as evidenced by him not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:13.120
realizing his leg was snapped in two. He&nbsp;
really needs to get a splint on that.
&nbsp;

00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:19.440
Oh no, Haley’s phone received a message, now she&nbsp;
has to go get it so she can text her friend back.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:24.720
I’m about to deduct her score to 6/10 here.&nbsp;
Going for your phone is just too much risk for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:30.320
too little gain. Who are you going to call? Beth?&nbsp;
Her inability to rescue you should be obvious.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:35.600
The police or animal control? Good luck with that,&nbsp;
I'm sure they’ll want to risk their lives fishing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:40.400
alligators out of your basement during a hurricane&nbsp;
in this fictional world where gators are this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:43.680
cunning, aggressive, and deadly.
Hell, in this fictional world,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:48.240
I don’t understand why anyone would ever live&nbsp;
in Florida. It’d be like living in Jurassic Park&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:52.800
with the power out. Nope, I think I can deal&nbsp;
with a few cold winter months instead.
&nbsp;

00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:57.280
Look, I'd get it if your uncle was Jocko Willink,&nbsp;
who would swim through the hurricane's flood&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:57.280 --> 00:23:02.560
waters to get to you, choking out any gators that&nbsp;
got in his way with his biceps. Actually, he’d&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:07.840
probably answer the phone and just say good.
Dad went missing in a category 5 hurricane?
&nbsp;

00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:13.280
Found him unconscious and bleeding&nbsp;
out from an alligator attack?
&nbsp;

00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:20.400
Got attacked by more alligators and now you’re&nbsp;
both trapped in a flooding crawl space.
&nbsp;

00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:30.720
They have the opportunity to reevaluate&nbsp;
why you made such horrible decisions.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:34.880
We all know they won’t though.
Time for galaxy brain move. They could just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:39.680
break through the wood floor above them. It’s so&nbsp;
obvious and simple, I would’ve thought that even&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:44.080
Dave and Haley could figure this out, but they&nbsp;
never do. With them being trapped in a crawl&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:49.360
space being so central to the plot, why wouldn’t&nbsp;
you choose a house that had a concrete slab over&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:54.160
the basement so it’s actually realistic. 
From this shot it just looks like some old wooden&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:59.520
planks held in by rusty nails. They could probably&nbsp;
lay on their backs and kick them loose. Well,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:03.840
Haley could. Dave could probably kick some&nbsp;
boards loose with one leg though. They wouldn’t&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:08.160
even need to kick them loose, later on in the&nbsp;
movie we see Dave crawl a few feet from their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:12.480
safe space to grab his tool belt and shovel.&nbsp;
They should easily be able to pry and push&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:17.600
the boards above them loose and escape. Dave&nbsp;
is a home contractor for fucks sake, how was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:23.680
this option never tried this entire movie.
Yep, Haley decides that securing her Iphone is the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:29.040
best method for getting out of here. Could she&nbsp;
at least go around her dad instead of crawling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:33.520
over his shattered leg. I don’t like Dave at&nbsp;
all, but he’s your dad and there’s no reason&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:38.320
to risk kneeing his fractured tibia.
Her dad tells her to go around to the left,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:43.520
because he thinks it’s safer. You literally&nbsp;
just became conscious. You have no idea where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:48.000
the alligator is or what has happened since&nbsp;
you got bitten. What would possibly make you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:53.200
think that that is a safer route? If anything,&nbsp;
taking the longer, more convoluted maze route&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:57.760
is far more dangerous than a straight shot to&nbsp;
the phone where you can quickly backtrack back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:01.200
past the pipes if necessary. 
After giving her shitty directions,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:06.000
Professor Dave then starts doling out some&nbsp;
unfounded alligator facts to Haley. Thanks,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.520
but I don’t think i’m going to be taking&nbsp;
advice from the dude who put himself in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:14.640
a precarious position and got bitten. I’d bet&nbsp;
my life his gator-facts are bullshit too.
&nbsp;

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:20.000
He first tells her that alligators can’t hear&nbsp;
out of the water. Patently false. Then he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:25.360
says that they can see in the dark well. That’s&nbsp;
actually true, they do have great night vision,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:31.120
but still, it's pretty common sense. His last&nbsp;
piece of advice is that alligators aren’t as fast&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:36.000
out of the water. This is technically true,&nbsp;
they are faster in the water. But when you’re&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:41.360
forced to crawl barefeet in the mud, they are&nbsp;
definitely way faster than you. Telling Haley&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:46.640
this is horribly misleading and just gives her&nbsp;
extremely dangerous levels of confidence. 
&nbsp;

00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:49.040
I’m surprised Dave lived long&nbsp;
enough to have kids.
