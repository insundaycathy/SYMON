00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.240
Detective Recapped here. Today, I'm going&nbsp;
to explain a Drama-Thriller film called:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.400
"Deadly Illusions.” Focused on a person's&nbsp;
grip on reality, this mind-boggling movie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.000
shows how something as common as a stressful&nbsp;
situation can lead to a person losing his mind.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.720
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.320
New York Times Best Selling Author, Mary Morrison,&nbsp;
is happily married to Tom Morrison. With a loving&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.960
husband, two beautiful children, and a successful&nbsp;
career, Mary can’t ask for more. After dropping&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.520
off her twins at school one day, Mary is visited&nbsp;
by her publisher, Kioki, and his associate,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.760
Darlene. They want Mary to write another book&nbsp;
for their best-selling series, Delirium, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.640
they offer her a handsome sum to do it. However,&nbsp;
Mary gets upset and refuses, saying she and Kioki&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.360
have already discussed it before. With Mary’s&nbsp;
adamance about not writing the book, they leave.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.160
That night, Tom arrives home and&nbsp;
sees the envelope from Kioki,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.160
and the offered amount to Mary surprises him.&nbsp;
With Tom asking why she didn’t tell him about it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.160
Mary finally reads the document, and she’s&nbsp;
astounded that $2 million is on the table.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.680
Tom notes that that's more money upfront than&nbsp;
all her books combined, but Mary doesn't want&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.880
to discuss it yet. As they prepare for dinner, Tom&nbsp;
advises her to seriously consider Kioki’s offer.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:07.120
After putting the kids to sleep, Mary sweetly&nbsp;
makes love with her husband. But when they finish,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:11.200
Tom confesses to losing half of their reserves&nbsp;
after making a risky investment six months ago,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.960
leaving Mary deeply upset. When Mary&nbsp;
first refused to talk about Kioki's offer,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.040
Tom's disappointment immediately hints that he's&nbsp;
hiding something from his wife. His suggestion&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.880
about considering taking the project also shows&nbsp;
he needs her help, but Mary doesn't even notice.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.760
Moreover, Tom's strategy to uplift Mary's mood by&nbsp;
making love to her before breaking the bad news&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.760
is a cheap one, especially since the mistake he&nbsp;
made isn't something that can be fixed overnight.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.160
After some time, Mary goes to the spa with her&nbsp;
friend, Elaine, who convinces her to take Kioki's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.960
offer. However, Mary isn't sure if she will since&nbsp;
she turns into a different person when she writes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.960
Elaine then suggests hiring a nanny to help her&nbsp;
with the twins, but Mary strongly opposes as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.640
she doesn't want someone else taking care of&nbsp;
her children. Determined to help her friend,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.800
Elaine gives Mary the contact number of her&nbsp;
client, Angela, who is a headhunter for sitters.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.240
Elaine stresses that her friend only recruits&nbsp;
girls who go to Ivy League schools and that a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.320
nanny is what she needs to get through. Clearly,&nbsp;
Mary’s at a crossroads with what she should do.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.720
Accepting Kioki’s offer’s the answer to her&nbsp;
current financial struggles, but as she hinted,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.760
she seems to struggle with her mental&nbsp;
health when writing. A nanny could help her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.680
but her motherly instinct to put her children&nbsp;
first comes out. To see any sort of resolution,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.480
something’s gotta give, and from the&nbsp;
looks of it, it’s going to be Mary.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.840
When Mary visits Angela in her office,&nbsp;
Angela gives her a tour of the place.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.920
Angela then offers to send a few candidates&nbsp;
for Mary to meet with, emphasizing that she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.080
can revisit if none of them work out. After&nbsp;
careful consideration, Mary accepts Angela's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.560
offer. During her meeting with the girls, Mary&nbsp;
immediately realizes that none of them stands out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.640
She tells Tom about her interview, and she&nbsp;
worries that hiring a nanny isn’t a good idea.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.240
Still, Tom reminds her that she won't&nbsp;
be able to handle everything on her own.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.320
Tom also adds that having a nanny might be good&nbsp;
for the kids, but when Mary says she can't picture&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.160
anyone taking care of her children the way she&nbsp;
does, her husband assures her no one can replace&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.480
her. Once again, Mary shows her reluctance to have&nbsp;
someone else take care of her kids other than her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.160
Even when she's interviewing the applicants, Mary&nbsp;
doesn't really seem interested and is just being&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.240
polite to the young ladies. As she talks to Tom&nbsp;
about the interview, it shows that as a mother,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.240
Mary is a perfectionist who won't settle for&nbsp;
anything less. When another interviewee arrives,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:06.000
Mary ends the call and greets the young&nbsp;
lady. Inside, the young woman takes her seat,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.760
and as she reads her book, Mary finds herself&nbsp;
staring at her. Mary starts the interview and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.280
learns that the young woman, Grace, is&nbsp;
from River Springs and loves reading.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.480
Their conversation is interrupted by&nbsp;
a phone call, so while Mary’s gone,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.680
Grace takes a look at the twins' photos&nbsp;
before getting a book from the counter.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.080
When the twins arrive, Grace sees them bickering.&nbsp;
She immediately talks to them and introduces&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.920
herself as Mary's friend. Mary hears their&nbsp;
conversation, and she smiles as she listens&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.600
to her kids' laughter. She then greets her&nbsp;
children and tells them to go to their room,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.960
and when Mary sees the book Grace is&nbsp;
holding, she tells the girl to follow her.

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:39.120
In Mary’s office, Grace gets surprised when she&nbsp;
realizes that Mary is a writer after getting one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.040
of her books from the shelf. A little hesitant,&nbsp;
Mary informs Grace that she still isn't sure if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.880
she needs someone full-time but asks her if she&nbsp;
is available in the coming week. Mary says she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.480
needs a little help since she's writing a new&nbsp;
book, and Grace is happy to accept her offer.&nbsp;

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.080
Grace and Mary's rapport is intensified by&nbsp;
their love for books, and maybe that is one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.000
of the reasons why Mary decided to give her a&nbsp;
chance. Grace is like a younger version of her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.280
and Mary must think that having her take&nbsp;
care of the twins doesn't seem so bad.

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.400
Grace and the kids quickly take&nbsp;
a liking to each other. One day,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.240
Elaine’s son and Mary’s twins ask their moms&nbsp;
if they could go for a swim, and Grace happily&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:12.480
volunteers to take them. Mary offers to lend Grace&nbsp;
a swimsuit, and when she notices that Grace is not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.640
comfortable with the one-piece, she gives the girl&nbsp;
something to cover herself up with. By the pool,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:20.080
Elaine notes that the swimsuit Mary&nbsp;
gave to Grace is too revealing. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:23.600
Mary insists she doesn't need to worry&nbsp;
about Grace since the girl is a prude.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.280
When Tom arrives and shakes hands with Grace,&nbsp;
Elaine waits if Mary will say something,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.960
but she remains quiet. Mary is confident&nbsp;
that she won't have any problems with Grace,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.800
but her best friend thinks otherwise. Although&nbsp;
she won't say it directly, Elaine feels like Grace&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.280
is too good to be true. Elaine only wants Mary to&nbsp;
be cautious, but Mary doesn't take her seriously.

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.840
In the evening, Tom congratulates&nbsp;
Mary for hiring Grace.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.160
They then make out in the kitchen before&nbsp;
making love in the pantry. When they return,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.640
Grace asks them if she could get the kids ready&nbsp;
for bed. Once Grace is done, Tom invites her to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:54.720
join them for dinner, but Grace politely refuses&nbsp;
and goes home. The couple has found more freedom&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.320
after hiring Grace. They can now enjoy more&nbsp;
intimate and enjoyable times together without&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.000
worrying about the kids since Grace is there&nbsp;
to take care of them. The next day, while Grace&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
arranges the plates in the kitchen, she suddenly&nbsp;
hears Mary screaming, so she quickly rushes to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.560
her aid. Mary has accidentally stepped on broken&nbsp;
glass, and as Grace puts ointment in her wound,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:15.120
Mary can't help but look at Grace's chest. Instead&nbsp;
of going back to work, Mary decides to take Grace&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.360
shopping. Mary helps Grace try new undergarments&nbsp;
and then tells the girl she wishes she had spent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:23.040
more time feeling good about her body. Grace&nbsp;
then places Mary's hand on her chest, trying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.960
to make her remember what it's like to be young&nbsp;
again. Mary buys the undergarments they've chosen,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:31.280
and at home, she tells Grace to wear some of the&nbsp;
old clothes she doesn't use anymore. Later that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:35.120
day, Mary asks her husband about his thoughts&nbsp;
on plastic surgery, mentioning that she's not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:39.760
getting any younger, but Tom simply tells her she&nbsp;
doesn't need it. As the couple talks, Grace enters&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:43.520
the room and informs them she'll be coming in late&nbsp;
the next day since she has a doctor's appointment.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:48.320
Here, it's a wonder why Mary doesn't get&nbsp;
startled when Grace places her hand on her chest.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:52.160
She believes that Grace is a bit old-fashioned,&nbsp;
but she doesn't even react to the girl's actions.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:56.720
Still, hints of Mary’s insecurity are starting to&nbsp;
creep, especially after seeing Grace half nude.

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:01.440
One day, Mary takes a break from work and&nbsp;
goes outside for a smoke. As she sits outside,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:05.040
Mary sees Grace from inside the house trying on&nbsp;
the clothes she gave her. Kioki then calls her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:09.520
attention, and Mary realizes she's daydreaming.&nbsp;
Kioki and Darlene want Mary to turn the main&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:13.440
character of her book, the mother, into a&nbsp;
villain, but Mary doesn't think it's a good idea.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:17.600
As their meeting continues, Mary finds herself&nbsp;
thinking about Grace, fantasizing about the girl&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:22.080
being undressed. Mary's problems begin here when&nbsp;
she starts having intrusive thoughts even at work.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.840
It's not even clear why the image of Grace's&nbsp;
bare body keeps popping into Mary's mind,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:30.240
only that she can't stop thinking about the girl.&nbsp;
Later on, Mary tells Elaine about her fantasy,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:34.400
and Elaine asks her if she's ever been&nbsp;
attracted to a woman before. When Mary says no,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:37.840
Elaine says it could all just be in her head.&nbsp;
Elaine then suggests that Mary could use her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:41.520
good relationship with Grace as an inspiration&nbsp;
to write since she's experiencing writer's block,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:45.840
and Mary takes her friend's advice. Though her&nbsp;
issues with Grace are new territory for her, Mary&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:50.480
has no problem confiding in Elaine. The two must&nbsp;
go way back, especially with how Mary’s always&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:55.200
listening to Elaine’s counsel. When she gets home,&nbsp;
Mary finds Tom and Grace talking to each other.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:59.200
Mary then kisses her husband and sits on his lap,&nbsp;
and when the twins call her, Grace volunteers to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:03.440
see what they need. When Tom reminds Mary about&nbsp;
their fundraiser dinner, Mary exclaims that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:07.120
she forgot about it and that she didn’t even&nbsp;
book a sitter. Overhearing their conversation,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:11.280
Grace offers to stay late, and the couple accepts.&nbsp;
Grace is always so attentive to Mary's needs,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:15.360
and Mary only sees this as something that the girl&nbsp;
is good at. Before Mary leaves for their dinner,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:19.760
Grace expresses her gratitude towards her for&nbsp;
giving her a job. Flattered, Mary tells her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:23.440
nanny they're lucky to have her, reminding&nbsp;
her that she's a very special young lady.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:26.880
Aside from being a golden nanny,&nbsp;
Grace also packs a silver tongue.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:30.560
She always knows which words to say to Mary&nbsp;
since she always manages to make her happy.

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:36.000
The next day, Mary writes topless by the pool.&nbsp;
She then asks Grace to put sunscreen on her back.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.480
Once done, Mary jumps into the pool and removes&nbsp;
her bikini, asking Grace to join her since nobody&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:44.720
is around. A little reluctant, Grace picks up&nbsp;
the bikini that Mary just took off and briefly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:49.440
goes inside the house to change. When she returns,&nbsp;
Grace jumps into the pool, too, enjoying her time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:54.160
with Mary. When they finally rest, Grace begs Mary&nbsp;
not to let her go, saying she's never felt more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:57.920
loved than when she's with her. Feeling sad for&nbsp;
Grace, Mary hugs the girl and tells her they'll be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:02.560
there for her forever. As she cradles Grace in her&nbsp;
arms, Mary tells Grace she's the reason she broke&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:06.960
her writer's block. Mary then falls asleep, and&nbsp;
when she opens her eyes, she sees Grace going down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:11.600
on her. But when she truly wakes up, Mary looks&nbsp;
around in confusion, unsure if what she saw was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:16.080
just a dream. With Mary loosening up a bit more&nbsp;
around Grace, she’s getting more and more dreams&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:20.560
about the girl. She’s helpless to Grace’s charms,&nbsp;
and she believes everything that the nanny says.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:24.160
As her dreams about Grace continue,&nbsp;
Mary must realize that something is off.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:27.760
After watching the twins' recital, Mary pulls&nbsp;
Grace aside to talk about what happened between&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:31.280
them. She tells Grace that they should forget&nbsp;
about it, but the girl doesn't even know what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:35.600
Mary is talking about. Mary then realizes that it&nbsp;
was just a dream, and she’s relieved that she's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:41.040
mistaken. After some time, Grace brings Mary some&nbsp;
rose petals and milk for her bath. She then feeds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:45.600
Mary some honey before giving her a massage. As&nbsp;
Grace's hands travel down her shoulders, Mary&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:50.240
tells her to stop. However, Grace insists and says&nbsp;
she just wants to make her happy. Defeated, Mary&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:55.040
lets her, so Grace continues with the massage.&nbsp;
Grace then puts her hand on Mary's private parts,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:59.600
enjoying as she watches Mary relish her touch.&nbsp;
Just as she is about to climax, Mary opens her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:03.920
eyes and realizes she's daydreaming again. When&nbsp;
she looks down, Mary is surprised to see that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:08.000
tub is filled with petals. At this point, it's&nbsp;
safe to say that Mary isn't sure what's real&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.160
anymore. She thinks what happened in the bathroom&nbsp;
was just a dream, but she proves herself wrong&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:16.720
when she sees the petals in the tub. The thing is,&nbsp;
Mary is actually enjoying her sensual moments with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:21.040
Grace, whether they're real or not. It’s hard&nbsp;
to say that she hasn't already made a mistake.

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:26.080
Over the next few days, Mary focuses on completing&nbsp;
her book. As Mary works, Grace and Tom grow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:30.560
closer. One day, Elaine gets suspicious when she&nbsp;
catches them dropping off the kids at school.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:34.880
She tries calling Mary to talk about what&nbsp;
she saw, but Mary won't answer her call.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:38.960
As Tom and Grace eat out, Tom notices that there's&nbsp;
something different about her, but he can't quite&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:43.840
point it out. Grace is acting completely carefree,&nbsp;
smiling and joking every time Tom says something.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:47.920
When they drive home, Grace happily dances to&nbsp;
the music, showing Tom a different side of her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:51.840
With the sudden change in Grace’s personality,&nbsp;
it isn’t a stretch to think that the red petals&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:56.320
in Mary’s tub come from the big red flag looming&nbsp;
over Grace. Tom already notices it and even asks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:59.760
Grace about it, but he ignores this and&nbsp;
thinks Grace is just having a good time.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:03.200
Grace, on the other hand, certainly looks&nbsp;
like she's having the time of her life,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:06.560
but the way she speaks and moves suggests&nbsp;
there's more to it than what Tom thinks.

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:10.880
Three weeks later, Mary and Grace ride their&nbsp;
bicycles and drink some wine by the river. As&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:15.040
Mary reads a book, Grace places her hand on Mary's&nbsp;
leg and caresses it until the two of them start&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:20.160
making out. Once again, Mary fails to pull herself&nbsp;
away from Grace, and instead, falls deeper into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:24.080
the nanny's enchantments. Mary tells Grace that&nbsp;
she sees so much of herself in her, and as their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:28.400
kiss deepens, Mary says they should stop. When&nbsp;
Grace thinks she did something wrong, Mary assures&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:32.720
her that she's perfect. Instead of acknowledging&nbsp;
the mistake they just made, Mary makes Grace feel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:36.000
that what they're doing is normal. She's&nbsp;
completely forgotten about her husband,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.760
and she doesn't even look guilty about it. They&nbsp;
then decide to head home, but they’re shocked to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:44.080
see that the bicycle's tire is slashed. Mary calls&nbsp;
her husband for help, but when she can't reach&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:48.720
him, the women walk home instead. There, Mary&nbsp;
finds Tom and Elaine talking in hushed voices.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:53.120
Grace tells him where they went, and the smile on&nbsp;
her face fades away when Tom kisses Mary. Elaine&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:57.360
then pulls Mary aside, subtly warning her that&nbsp;
Tom might be fooling around with Grace, but Mary&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:01.520
defends her nanny and calls Elaine paranoid. Mary&nbsp;
asks Elaine what she and Tom were talking about,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:05.360
but Elaine doesn’t answer when she sees Grace&nbsp;
approaching them. Elaine only says they should&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:09.760
just talk about it next time, and she reminds Mary&nbsp;
that she loves her before finally driving home.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:14.000
Out of the three adults, it looks like Elaine is&nbsp;
the only one who can see right through Grace. Her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000
repeated attempts to warn Mary about her nanny is&nbsp;
proof that she doesn't trust the girl, but Mary&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000
refuses to see that. Mary even doubts Elaine's&nbsp;
motives with how she’s always asking questions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.760
about Grace. This must hurt Elaine’s feelings&nbsp;
since she knows Mary better than Grace does.

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:30.160
While Grace prepares their food for dinner, she&nbsp;
asks Mary if she realizes how beautiful she is.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:33.840
Mary feels flattered, and as she tells Grace&nbsp;
about her and Tom's anniversary the next day,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:37.920
Grace starts touching her again. Although Mary is&nbsp;
hesitant, she just gives in and lets Grace do what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:42.080
she wants with her. As Grace goes down on her,&nbsp;
Tom and the twins suddenly arrive, forcing them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:47.120
to stop. Pretending like nothing happened, Mary&nbsp;
excuses herself, saying she wants to lie down.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:51.200
Clearly, Mary has already lost herself with how&nbsp;
she does vulgar things with Grace without fear,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:53.200
even when Tom and the twins are in the house.

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:55.840
As Mary is about to sleep, she hears&nbsp;
Grace shouting from the kitchen.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:56.400 --> 00:12:00.800
When she checks it out, Mary sees Grace and Tom&nbsp;
making out on the counter before passing out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:05.040
Mary then wakes up, unsure if she just had another&nbsp;
dream, and joins Grace and her family for dinner.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:08.960
As they sit at the table, Mary confronts Grace&nbsp;
and Tom about what she saw, but Grace remains&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:12.960
quiet about it. When the kids get scared by Mary's&nbsp;
behavior, Tom assures them that their mother is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:17.600
just unwell. Mary then apologizes to the twins,&nbsp;
saying when she writes, her imagination gets so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:21.680
vivid that she can't tell which ones are real.&nbsp;
Since Mary’s aware that the way her mind works&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:25.920
changes when she’s writing, the confrontation&nbsp;
is almost careless. She doesn’t have any proof,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:29.520
she isn’t sure if what she saw was real, and&nbsp;
she did it in front of her children. Instead of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:34.000
resolving the issue, Mary only embarrasses herself&nbsp;
and frightens her children. In their bedroom,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.840
Mary tells her husband how she really feels about&nbsp;
him expecting her to clean up the mess he made.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:41.840
Tom apologizes and comforts his wife, reminding&nbsp;
her that she's almost through with her work, which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:46.000
finally calms Mary down. Despite the frequent&nbsp;
romancing they’ve been doing, the pressure from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.480
their financial problem isn’t lost on Mary. It’s&nbsp;
put her under undue stress and pressure, while all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:54.320
Tom could do is console her since he knows it’s&nbsp;
all his fault. This may even be partly the reason&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:58.240
why Mary keeps gravitating towards Grace—she’s&nbsp;
a break from all her troubles, and she lets Mary&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:02.400
feel like she could rely on her. Sometime after&nbsp;
midnight, Mary wakes up and goes for a smoke,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:06.640
only to realize that she’s out of tobacco. She&nbsp;
then notices that the light in her office is on,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:10.640
and when she sees that nobody is there, Mary&nbsp;
gets her manuscript before going back to sleep.

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:14.720
The next day, Mary calls the nanny agency&nbsp;
about a check she sent them a while ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:18.480
During the call, Mary is surprised to learn that&nbsp;
they're actually waiting for her to decide which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:22.880
nanny she wants to go with. When she asks if Grace&nbsp;
works with them, the agency informs her they don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:27.520
have anyone by that name. Confused, Mary ends the&nbsp;
call and hides what she just learned from Grace.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:32.240
Then, she apologizes to Grace for her outburst,&nbsp;
but she says she understands her. Though she’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:35.920
known for her writing, Mary chooses to flaunt&nbsp;
her poor decision-making skills instead when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:39.840
she doesn’t ask for the police or anyone’s help&nbsp;
despite her growing suspicions toward Grace. When&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:44.160
Grace leaves, Mary decides to find Grace's address&nbsp;
by going to the library and looking for the last&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:48.240
book she checked out. Once she has it, Mary calls&nbsp;
Elaine and tells her they need to talk before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:52.560
going to her office. Upon arriving at Elaine's&nbsp;
workplace, Mary is horrified to see that her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:56.800
friend has been stabbed in the neck with a pair&nbsp;
of scissors. After she calls 911, the authorities&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:01.120
take Elaine's body away, and an officer invites&nbsp;
Mary to the station. There, Mary learns that she's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:05.280
the main suspect in Elaine's murder. Mary must&nbsp;
be feeling guilty since she had an argument with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:09.200
Elaine the last time they saw each other, and that&nbsp;
already gives her the motive to hurt her friend.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:13.280
And while the detective questions Mary, it is&nbsp;
clear that he already has something against her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:16.400
The detective reveals that they found her&nbsp;
fingerprints on the murder weapon before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:19.680
showing footage of her arriving at and leaving&nbsp;
Elaine's office at around one in the morning.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:24.000
In the video, however, she’s wearing a scarf and&nbsp;
sunglasses which obscure her face. The detective&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.080
also shows Mary an excerpt of her writing, saying&nbsp;
it's too similar to what happened to Elaine.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:32.320
Maintaining her innocence, Mary asserts that her&nbsp;
publisher, Tom, and Grace, all have access to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:36.800
her work. Before she could say another word, Tom&nbsp;
arrives with a lawyer and keeps her from talking.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:41.120
The more Mary denies her involvement in Elaine's&nbsp;
death, the more she looks guilty of killing her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:45.680
Mary is just relieved that Tom arrived, seeing as&nbsp;
she’s only inches away from incriminating herself.

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:49.520
Outside the interrogation room, Mary wonders&nbsp;
how her fingerprints got on the scissors,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:53.280
but Tom simply says all their fingerprints&nbsp;
are on them, too, and even the kids'.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:57.280
When Tom asks where she was the previous night,&nbsp;
Mary explains she got up for a smoke before going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:01.200
to her office to lock it up and then went back&nbsp;
to bed. Mary insists she didn't go anywhere else,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:05.520
but she gets confused when Tom tells her she was&nbsp;
gone for 3 hours. He also tells her that the slash&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:09.040
from her bicycle came from a Swiss army knife&nbsp;
they found in the garage, which only contains her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:13.120
fingerprints. Tom then asks when she last attended&nbsp;
a session with Elaine, and Mary says it was years&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:17.680
ago. Unsure what to believe, Tom informs Mary&nbsp;
that the authorities also found Elaine's notes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:21.680
from one of their sessions, proving that Mary&nbsp;
has been experiencing memory gaps, time loss, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:26.560
out-of-body experiences. Here, it is revealed that&nbsp;
Elaine was actually Mary's therapist. No matter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:30.320
how sure Mary is that she didn't do anything to&nbsp;
Elaine, her confidence starts to crumble when she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:35.440
realizes how much time she's lost and forgotten.&nbsp;
Still, Mary refuses to believe she's the culprit.

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:39.200
In search of the truth, Mary goes to Grace's&nbsp;
address to enlighten herself. Though Mary’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:43.360
thoroughly implicated here, a flashback reveals&nbsp;
that Grace is the one who slashed Mary's tires,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:47.840
stole the scissors, and even smoked Mary's last&nbsp;
tobacco while she slept. Upon arriving in River&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:52.240
Springs, California, Mary speaks with Grace’s&nbsp;
aunt. The woman acts oddly, and she even changes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:56.560
her voice from time to time. Still, she explains&nbsp;
that Grace has suffered mistreatment at the hands&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:56.560 --> 00:16:01.200
of her parents. Mary also learns that Grace&nbsp;
used to work in a spa. In another flashback,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:04.960
it is shown that Grace was at the spa the day&nbsp;
Mary and Elaine were talking about Mary's writing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:09.040
She took a picture of Angela's calling card&nbsp;
and applied as a nanny, but got rejected.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:13.040
Grace also stole Mary's address from Angela's&nbsp;
files when she left the room. When she returned&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:16.320
to inform Grace they're not hiring as of&nbsp;
the moment, Grace got mad and insulted her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:20.720
Finally, it is made clear that Grace isn't&nbsp;
who she says she is. If only Mary had paid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:24.560
more attention to what's happening around her,&nbsp;
including her dreams, Grace's changing behavior,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:27.760
and Elaine’s warnings, then she would've&nbsp;
noticed right away that her nanny is bad news.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:31.440
Instead, she has given Grace&nbsp;
power over herself and her family.

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:35.520
On her way home, Mary calls Tom to warn&nbsp;
him about Grace, but he can't be reached.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:39.920
Meanwhile, Grace shows up in the bathroom with a&nbsp;
knife, wearing full makeup and seductive lingerie.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:43.840
Warning Tom to listen to everything she says,&nbsp;
Grace informs him that she's completely insane.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:48.240
She then repeatedly attacks Tom with a knife, and&nbsp;
he is unable to defend himself due to his wounds.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:52.000
When Mary arrives home, Tom collapses on&nbsp;
the floor while Grace returns to her sweet,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.840
innocent self and changes her clothes. She then&nbsp;
greets a frantic Mary and tells her the kids are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:59.920
in their room. When Mary asks for her husband,&nbsp;
Grace warns her not to go to the bathroom,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:03.440
saying it's messy there. However, Mary ignores&nbsp;
her and heads straight to the bathroom,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:07.840
where she finds Tom bleeding. As Mary tends to&nbsp;
him, Grace arrives and starts cleaning the blood&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:13.120
on the floor. Absurdly enough, she even apologizes&nbsp;
for the mess. After Mary orders Grace to call 911,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:17.360
she asks the nanny who harmed Tom. Crying, Grace&nbsp;
says she tried to stop "her," revealing that she's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:21.280
suffering from Dissociative Identity Disorder.&nbsp;
At this point, Tom is already telling Mary that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:25.440
Grace tried to seduce him, and she even knows&nbsp;
that Grace is a dangerous person. Ridiculously,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:29.760
Mary still orders Grace to call 911 for her.&nbsp;
It’s like she’s purposely turning a blind eye&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:33.520
on everything even though the answer is already in&nbsp;
front of her. This leaves Mary and Tom to watch as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:37.520
their nanny switches back and forth between being&nbsp;
Grace to Margaret, who is Grace's other identity.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:41.360
Margaret wants to kill them, but Grace keeps&nbsp;
trying to fight back and tells Mary to run. When&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:45.600
Mary bolts for the door, Margaret follows her, and&nbsp;
the two brawl it out. Meanwhile, Mary's daughter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:49.920
tries to check what's going on downstairs, but she&nbsp;
realizes their door is locked. Mary and Margaret&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:53.840
continue fighting, and as Grace struggles to&nbsp;
overpower her other identity, Margaret starts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:57.920
strangling Mary. During their fight, Mary has&nbsp;
already managed to hurt Grace using the blender,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:01.920
but she gets distracted and stops when the nanny&nbsp;
cries in pain, proving that she still cares about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:06.480
her. However, caring for a dangerous and unstable&nbsp;
person can be deadly, and that is Mary's greatest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:10.560
weakness. Mary has already had many chances&nbsp;
to subdue Grace, especially while the nanny&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:14.880
struggles to overpower her other identity,&nbsp;
but Mary just chooses to watch her. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:19.440
Mary manages to reach for a vase, and she smashes&nbsp;
it against her nanny's head, finally subduing her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:23.440
When Grace opens her eyes, she apologizes&nbsp;
to Mary and begs her not to give up on her.

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:27.200
One year later, Mary happily moves on with&nbsp;
her life with her family. To show her love&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:31.680
and respect for her, Mary leaves her finished&nbsp;
manuscript at Elaine's grave. Unfortunately,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:35.280
the couple doesn't even address the issues they've&nbsp;
had with Grace, especially Mary's struggles&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:39.300
to control her desire for the woman. Mary then&nbsp;
visits Grace in a psychiatric hospital, and she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:43.840
is ecstatic to see her. They start playing a card&nbsp;
game, and when Mary leaves, she is seen wearing a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:47.600
scarf and sunglasses, looking exactly like the&nbsp;
woman who emerged from Elaine's office when she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:51.200
was murdered. This leaves the question of whether&nbsp;
it’s really Mary who gets out of the hospital or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:55.440
Grace in disguise. The movie itself leaves many&nbsp;
unanswered questions, like where Mary was during&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:59.280
those three hours she got out of bed and how&nbsp;
real her romantic relationship with Grace was.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:03.040
It remains unclear which events are just a figment&nbsp;
of Mary's imagination and which ones are not.
