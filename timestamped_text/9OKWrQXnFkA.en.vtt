00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:06.080
If you were transported into the beginning
of A Quiet Place’s alien invasion, with

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:11.340
nothing but your lack of survival skills,
your empty supplies cabinet, and the leftover

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.670
food in your fridge, could you not just survive,
but fight back and win?

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:17.670
Intro (Background of Topic + What they’ll
learn / Open Loop)

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:25.010
In this video on Nerd Explains, I’ll tell
you: How to Kill, The Monsters from A Quiet

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:26.010
Place.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.010
Know Thy Enemy

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:28.930
What’s the skinny on these monsters?

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.290
I’ve read the wiki, but some of that’s
a bit bullshit.

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:37.030
They are aliens that hitched a ride on an
asteroid that landed on Earth.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:43.630
The most important piece of intel is that
they are blind-ish, and hunt by sound primarily.

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:48.740
Though their hearing is obscenely good, they
seem to get confused by sounds easily.

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:55.079
They can’t see, but they can use echolocation
to maneuver their environment and locate prey.

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:02.050
In the movie it’s a really rough form of
echolocation, as they can’t see very well,

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:07.590
but in real life if they had the echolocation
abilities of a bat, they could see you walking

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.360
around outside and murder you.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:16.390
They have armor that is supposedly impenetrable,
but that’s most likely just for small arms

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:17.390
fire.

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.440
They can seemingly survive the vacuum of space
and don’t need oxygen.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:27.100
We never see the monsters feed, but they have
to sustain themselves so let's assume they

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.690
do eat off screen, they have teeth and a mouth
afterall.

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:38.240
Oh, and they have superhuman speed, strength,
and sharp claws that can rip through armor.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.950
What happened to our military?

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.270
A lot of people wonder why the military failed
to kill these monsters.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.200
These things came down on an asteroid, most
likely more than one.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.560
Which means they probably landed all over
the world, in lots of cities for all we know.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.590
With the speed, durability, and stealth of
these monsters, they could spread all over

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.760
cities in short order.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.299
Guerilla warfare is historically super effective.

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:09.489
This means we wouldn’t be able to fight
them on a front, nor would we be able to create

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:10.530
supply lines.

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.189
It’s hard to get choppers off the ground
when these creatures could shred them on the

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:21.200
landing pad, and even if we could, they’d
be hard to detect, and most likely would be

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.019
close proximity to innocent civilians.

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:30.549
Can’t exactly drop a hellfire missile into
the local Target parking lot or open up the

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:35.719
20mm cannon on the monsters while they are
shredding wage slaves that are stuck in rush

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:36.829
hour traffic.

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:42.099
We don’t know how many of these things there
are, and with how quickly they attacked we

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:47.129
wouldn’t be able to organize a defense strategy
factoring in their potential weaknesses.They

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:52.809
might hide from extremely loud noises (say,
tanks or massed groups of soldiers) and attack

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:58.049
only in isolated pockets or slip past them
to get to civilian populations.

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:02.439
Even if the military killed a ton, it wasn’t
enough.

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:07.249
But what if we guerilla warfare them back
like we did with the British?

00:03:07.249 --> 00:03:13.620
Well the british wore red uniforms for camouflage
and walked down city streets singing and pounding

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:19.689
on drums in formation whilst being picked
off by farmers like Mel Gibson.

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:24.379
These are ninja space aliens that might even
pose a challenge to Riddick, just kidding,

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:27.749
Vin Diesel would trash them with a sick one-liner.

00:03:27.749 --> 00:03:33.849
That only really works if you’re the minority
and can hide amongst the populations.

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:38.959
So our military is defeated, pockets of resistance
are all that’s left.

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:42.819
You are now solely responsible for your own
survival.

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:46.519
What precautions do we need to take when hunting
these monsters?

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:51.750
The first rule of a quiet place is to not
talk about a quiet place.

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.760
All the standard library rules apply.

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.729
The second rule is to not get pregnant or
have kids.

00:03:58.729 --> 00:04:04.449
If you already broke the second rule, fear
not, you can sacrifice them as bait or diversions

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:08.510
before they get you killed by playing with
the Turboman they found in a store while you

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:09.510
were trying to find supplies so you could
put food on the fucking table so you all didn’t

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:10.510
die.

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:16.299
Third rule is to always have a pocket full
of lures, fireworks, rocks if you get snapped

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:20.510
up.

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:26.250
Luckily the monsters have a low IQ and if
they are inches from killing you and they

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.810
hear a kid pop a bottle rocket off in the
distance they will completely forget about

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:31.810
you.

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.060
Getting the Tools of the Trade

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.060
If you spread the map on the table, we can
pin some important locations for supplies

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:35.060
we’ll need.

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:36.060
Grocery stores, gas stations, hardware stores,
industrial equipment, national guard armories,

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.060
police station armories, etc.

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:38.060
Here’s a protip, don’t worry about getting
food or supplies when shit is going down.

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:44.220
Lay low for a month or so, your fat stores
will sustain you for a while.

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:49.050
Most people don’t watch videos like this,
they suck, they panic, they will get killed.

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:53.520
Once your neighbors all got themselves killed,
you can raid their houses.

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.100
Since these aliens don’t eat everything
they kill, there should be plenty of dead

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:02.610
wildlife around to throw on the grill as well,
or human meat if that’s what you’re into.

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:07.910
If you kill one of the creatures you could
eat their meat as well, though they look a

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:14.000
bit emaciated, but who knows, there’s probably
a lot of lean protein under that exoskeleton.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:20.590
So the military is defeated, your neighbors
are all dead, things have gotten really quiet.

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:26.160
You generally know what the alien’s weaknesses
are, and supplies are bountiful around town.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:30.830
It’s time to put monster meat back on the
menu.

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:37.070
Right before we jump in though, if you find
these types of videos entertaining, consider

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:41.900
clicking the like and subscribe buttons as
it really helps me to make more.

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:43.030
Firearms

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:46.740
We gotta acquire some military firearms.

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:51.810
Before you say oh nerd explains but those
make sounds and where are you gonna get them

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:55.040
this is a tiny IQ move, hold up.

00:05:55.040 --> 00:06:01.050
These monsters might be resistant to AR15’s,
marksman rifles, and even Ma Deuce 50 cal

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:03.610
machine guns when in turtle mode.

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:10.890
But an AT4 84-mm unguided, portable, single-shot
recoilless smoothbore weapon firing high explosive

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:17.140
anti tank projectiles with 16.5 inches of
armor penetration via a high velocity jet

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:22.450
stream of molten liquid metal that is traveling
at ~25k miles an hour.

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:30.940
“But their armor is impenetrable”, as
Bronn in GOT said it, give me a clear line

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:39.870
of sight and an AT4, and i’ll penetrate
the bitch, something like that.

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:43.930
As to where to get it, Idk do national guard
armories have AT4’s?

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:48.870
If they do, then pop on a paramotor and fly
over to it.

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:54.510
Yah, a paramotor, one of the best most versatile
methods of transportation in the apocalypse.

00:06:54.510 --> 00:07:01.230
It’s a bit noisy to start up, but you can
be in the air in seconds, and you can turn

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:04.040
the motor off before landing quietly.

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:07.930
I could go on about the paramotor but trust
me.

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:12.840
I wonder if you could fire a rocket launcher
from a paramotor.

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:13.840
Hmm.

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:19.310
Rocket launchers aside, they have a critical
weakness to any small arms a civilian could

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:22.370
obtain, and no it’s not a fucking hearing
aid.

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:27.920
See, these monsters stay turtled when they
hear loud noises, but when they get close

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:33.750
and their prey gets quiet, they drop their
shield exoskeleton so that they can tune in

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:35.290
and listen more closely.

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:39.310
That’s when you hit them with the pump,
right in the ear hole.

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:44.490
The hearing aid high frequency thing isn’t
necessary, but it’s helpful.

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:50.130
I’m kinda mad Sergeant Rita Vrataski and
Jack Ryan couldn’t figure this out earlier.

00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:55.450
Since these monsters attack individually and
not like a pack of wolves, this makes things

00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:56.450
easier.

00:07:56.450 --> 00:08:03.210
Yes they are fast, but realistically you could
use cameras to find isolated monsters.

00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:08.620
Place a radio or baby monitor if you broke
the second rule, in the middle of a field,

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:14.530
with a remote control raise the volume until
an isolated monster hears it, then lower the

00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:18.160
volume until it’s barely audible one they
are close.

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:21.190
When they get super close, turn the radio
off.

00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:26.080
This will draw the monster close, then make
them open their armor so they can listen more

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:29.630
closely to try to find what they think is
hiding prey.

00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:37.829
The last thing they will hear is the click
of the trigger break before a .338 Lapua enters

00:08:37.829 --> 00:08:45.990
their cranium and, since they’re armored,
that bullet will ping pong around their insides

00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:48.050
turning their guts to soup.

00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:52.319
If you broke the second rule we talked about
earlier, and your girl is pregnant or you

00:08:52.319 --> 00:08:56.470
have a newborn, maybe you don’t want to
be popping off rocket propelled grenades and

00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:58.269
ripping off belt-feds.

00:08:58.269 --> 00:09:02.410
Or maybe you don’t want to draw every nearby
monster to your position.

00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:04.389
What else can we use?

00:09:04.389 --> 00:09:06.089
Poison Dart Air Guns.

00:09:06.089 --> 00:09:09.328
Super quiet, use a similar formula as above,
except you’re going to need to get close.

00:09:09.328 --> 00:09:10.401
The CIA used these as heart attack guns I
guess, it’s not relevant, just thought that

00:09:10.401 --> 00:09:11.401
was interesting.

00:09:11.401 --> 00:09:14.930
As far as what poison to use, honestly just
dip the dart in human shit.

00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:18.450
It’s not like the monsters have healthcare
insurance and hospitals.

00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:24.620
A shot into their exposed face would cause
a nasty infection that they can’t treat.

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:26.350
Same shit for bow and arrows.

00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:31.400
These are accessible at your local sporting
goods store just like airguns, and are quiet

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:33.600
methods of creature killing.

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:38.100
Since the monster you’re attacking will
no doubt hear the bow launching the arrow,

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:42.240
you still only have 1 shot to get it right
just like with firearms.

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:47.600
The benefit to bows is that you don’t attract
every monster in a 3 mile radius.

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:49.199
Throwing Knives.

00:09:49.199 --> 00:09:56.199
Again, you need to lure them in close, then
stay quiet, they will open their armor in

00:09:56.199 --> 00:09:57.740
an attempt to tune in and hear you, that’s
when you stick em.

00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:01.529
Okay this is mainly for showoffs going for
the kill of the year.

00:10:01.529 --> 00:10:07.290
It’s obscenely dangerous as you need to
be within 7 yards unless you’re jason statham.

00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:20.050
It’s unique in that it really makes no sound
at all to throw a knife.

00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:24.149
They couldn’t really pinpoint where it was
thrown from.

00:10:24.149 --> 00:10:29.459
If you miss, they will attack the noise where
the knife landed instead of you.

00:10:29.459 --> 00:10:32.079
This is definitely for experts only.

00:10:32.079 --> 00:10:33.730
Ewok Logs.

00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:40.649
If you can silently cut two trees down, string
them up, lure the monster in between the two

00:10:40.649 --> 00:10:44.999
tree logs, you can do the monsters like the
ewoks did that at-st’s.

00:10:44.999 --> 00:10:50.720
Just don’t also use slingshots with rocks
like they did, that’s just suicide.

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:51.720
Explosives

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:55.889
We already discussed how an AT4 will splatter
these space aliens.

00:10:55.889 --> 00:10:58.310
But C4 is also another tool.

00:10:58.310 --> 00:11:00.050
But not in the way you might think.

00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:05.639
The monster when turtled could potentially
survive a close proximity blast, but given

00:11:05.639 --> 00:11:11.360
that the monsters are always using their ears
to hunt you, this presents another weakness

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:13.089
we can exploit.

00:11:13.089 --> 00:11:17.269
Projectile weapons won’t be able to get
through the tiny cracks in their armor, but

00:11:17.269 --> 00:11:18.749
air can.

00:11:18.749 --> 00:11:20.100
Yes, air.

00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:25.490
The overpressure caused by an explosive blast
will rupture any soft tissues.

00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:28.769
The ears are the first organs to feel the
change in pressure.

00:11:28.769 --> 00:11:30.389
That's what they're designed for, after all.

00:11:30.389 --> 00:11:34.660
Ears are meant to allow people to sense minute
changes in air pressure - sound - over short

00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:35.660
amounts of time.

00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:39.310
As such, they're extremely sensitive to pressure,
especially with these monsters.

00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:45.069
A wave of pressure that lasts less than .3
milliseconds leaves the eardrum no time to

00:11:45.069 --> 00:11:49.069
adjust to changes in pressure, and simply
tears it.

00:11:49.069 --> 00:11:54.699
Basically, the monster might survive the blast,
but their primary sensing organ for hunting

00:11:54.699 --> 00:11:56.499
you, gets obliterated.

00:11:56.499 --> 00:12:00.279
Now that they are deaf, they can be killed
much more easily.

00:12:00.279 --> 00:12:03.970
As far as how to get C4 that close to them.

00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:05.080
Baiting is easy.

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:09.629
Burt Gummer pioneered the RC car bomb in Tremors.

00:12:09.629 --> 00:12:10.629
Napalm.

00:12:10.629 --> 00:12:16.480
I know that the monsters are heat resistant
and don’t need oxygen for survival, but

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:22.890
it’s just easy to make and worth a shot,
all you need is gasoline and packing peanuts.

00:12:22.890 --> 00:12:27.579
String up a bucket of homemade napalm above
a door home alone style.

00:12:27.579 --> 00:12:32.559
Once the monster comes through the door, a
wire gets tripped, napalm gets dumped on the

00:12:32.559 --> 00:12:35.960
monster, and a secondary torch gets lit.

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:39.380
It’s a macaulay culkin classic with a bit
more of an edge to it.

00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:44.500
If the monster's ears are perked up as it
walks through the door and the lit napalm

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:48.300
gets under the armor, it could do some damage.

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:54.019
To kick it up a notch, you can add homemade
thermite to the mix, 4000 degree liquid metal

00:12:54.019 --> 00:12:59.420
getting poured all over you would certainly
fuck up it’s day at the very least.

00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:00.420
Electricity

00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:05.129
Biological organisms and electricity don’t
bode well when combined.

00:13:05.129 --> 00:13:07.420
Just ask Marv from home alone.

00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:13.480
Since these monsters like to swim, once they
take a dip in a body of water, throw in the

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:15.500
toaster or clothing iron.

00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:20.730
Or you could go high tech and fire up a generator
that’s hooked up to surrounding electrified

00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:21.730
fences.

00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:25.619
Once they try to get through the fence to
attack the noisy generator, they’ll get

00:13:25.619 --> 00:13:27.660
a taste of that lightning.

00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:28.660
Industrial Equipment

00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:30.899
Rock crushers and wood chippers.

00:13:30.899 --> 00:13:35.119
If you’re creative enough to find a way
to get one of these monsters into the mouth

00:13:35.119 --> 00:13:38.040
of a rock crusher, it’s game over.

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:43.290
Those jaws are insanely powerful and even
if one of these monsters takes a swing at

00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:51.100
it out of frustration at the noise, if that
limb gets caught in the jaws or the chipper,

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:52.829
mm.

00:13:52.829 --> 00:13:56.970
Something about killing space aliens by repurposing
industrial equipment.

00:13:56.970 --> 00:13:58.069
The Environment

00:13:58.069 --> 00:14:02.981
Zombieland 2 had a great scene where they
funneled the zombies onto the rooftop of a

00:14:02.981 --> 00:14:08.389
tall building, then Tallahassee leapt off
the edge and grabbed a crane hook that dangled

00:14:08.389 --> 00:14:10.149
past the edge.

00:14:10.149 --> 00:14:13.269
All the zombies jumped after him, falling
to their deaths.

00:14:13.269 --> 00:14:18.649
These monsters don’t seem too smart, and
it doesn’t seem like their echolocation

00:14:18.649 --> 00:14:22.730
is that accurate, so this is probably worth
a shot.

00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:28.110
See, this is why you watch movies, so when
the apocalypse hits you have all these strategies

00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:29.190
in mind.

00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:33.129
Instructions are the same if you live near
a volcano or cliff.

00:14:33.129 --> 00:14:40.660
In conclusion, I think with a little ingenuity,
some elbow grease, and a pile of plastic explosives

00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:44.879
we could end this threat before we gave up
like those pussies John and Emily.

00:14:44.879 --> 00:14:47.709
How would you kill the monsters in A Quiet
Place?

00:14:47.709 --> 00:14:51.269
Do you agree with my selections, why or why
not?

00:14:51.269 --> 00:14:52.589
Let me know in the comments.

00:14:52.589 --> 00:14:56.160
And while you’re at it, let me know what
other movies or games you want me to cover

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:58.739
like this.

00:14:58.739 --> 00:15:07.169
Thanks for watching, later.
