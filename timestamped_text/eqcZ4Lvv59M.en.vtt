00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.080
Welcome back to Movie Recaps.

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:07.589
Today I will show you an action, crime, fantasy
film from 2017, titled What Happened to Monday.

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:08.750
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:10.889
Watch out and take care.

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.480
Human behavior has drastically impacted the
environment and with an ever-increasing population,

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.410
there is a dramatic shortage of food.

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.920
To combat the crisis the European Federation
has developed genetically modified crops,

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.960
that are more resilient and have a high yield.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.090
This scientific breakthrough had caused a
different problem.

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.880
There is a staggering spike in multiple births
and genetic defects globally.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.460
The solution is feeding the problem furthermore.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.690
The political activist and conservation biologist
Doctor Nicolette Cayman has asked the Federation

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.950
to institute a one child per family policy,
called "the child allocation act".

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:45.430
She was successful in her efforts to push
the legislation so the world is facing new

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:46.770
restrictive measures.

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.340
Illegally conceived siblings would have to
be remanded in cryo-sleep.

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.770
The children will be humanely stored in cryo-sleep
until the global issues have been resolved.

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:56.350
They will awake in a better world.

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.920
A doctor approaches Terrence Settman who is
looking at his seven granddaughters in the

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:00.920
nursery.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.559
He tells the grandfather that if they were
better equipped they could have saved his

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:04.559
daughter.

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.990
Terrence doesn't know who the father is because
he hasn't spoken to his daughter in a long

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.990
time.

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:10.970
The doctor asks him how he will hide them.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.320
Terrence says that he'll manage and names
the girls after the seven days of the week.

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.050
30 years later, we see one of the siblings
on the street.

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.119
Sunday is leaving the sector where she works.

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:24.250
On her way home, she witnesses officers taking
a sibling from a distraught family, under

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.680
the child allocation act.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.570
Then, she goes to a market and buys rat meat
with an identity bracelet.

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.870
Sunday enters her building and has a chat
with the security guard Eddie, who tells her

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:35.850
something that he feels he's already said
to her before.

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.940
Sunday enters the apartment and later is seen
serving dinner to the rest of her siblings.

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.420
Thursday thinks the food is gross, while Wednesday
seems to enjoy it.

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.020
Tuesday says that it's beautiful.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.580
Saturday jokes with Wednesday that she'd eat
anything.

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.900
They all laugh at her jokes except Monday.

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.120
She's worried about a presentation she needs
to give the next day.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.540
Thursday says that if they do get the promotion
it will all be because of Friday, who's their

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:57.969
resident genius.

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:01.320
Terrence can be seen in a flashback teaching
them how they would operate in the world as

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.320
one.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.509
He tells them that in time they will select
a carrier that capitalizes on their collective

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:06.509
strengths.

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.670
Later, he's seen making a hidden room for
the girls and then training them to hide their

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.450
things and themselves if the time for that
ever comes.

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.280
Terrence hides the rest of the stuff and walks
over to Sunday, who's the only one left outside.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.830
Friday joins him as he makes copies of the
identity bracelet for all of them.

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.440
One day, he sits the girls down to explain
the rules by which they will operate in the

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.440
world.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.950
Each girl will be allowed to leave the house
on the day that is their name.

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.260
Inside the house, they can be themselves,
but outside they will take on the singular

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.230
identity of Karen Settman.

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.800
Thursday asks if she can play outside and
he answers that she may, but only if it's

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.990
her day and never together with her sisters.

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.569
They must never tell anyone that they have
siblings.

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:45.099
Tuesday is the first one to leave the house
for school.

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:48.830
As Terrence takes her out, she gets overwhelmed
by the crowd and stops.

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.580
They enter another sector of the city and
they scan her bracelet, revealing a successful

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:53.580
copy.

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.300
Terrence drops her off at school and reminds
her that she's the only Karen Settman.

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.459
That night, he tells the girls that the meeting
at the end of the day is when they should

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:03.260
share all the details of the past day with
their siblings.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.430
They watch Tuesday's video of the day.

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.600
Cut to the present and Sunday is showing her
videos from that day.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.410
The siblings feel sorry for the allocated
girl and Wednesday makes a sly comment about

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:13.410
Cayman.

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.450
Thursday wonders about what would happen if
they turn themselves to the CAB.

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.120
All of the women think that's a horrible idea.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.220
Monday seems to especially dislike it and
the two of them argue.

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.739
Thursday wishes to live free as herself and
not as Karen Settman - a mask they put on

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:27.090
one day a week.

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.790
Wednesday and Saturday tell the two to stop
arguing, so Thursday leaves the room saying

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.650
how what they have isn't a life.

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.299
In a flash-forward, she remembers herself
leaving the house on a Saturday after her

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:38.810
sister and grandfather have left for the day.

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.640
Later, Terrence is questioning the rest of
the girls about where she could've gone.

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.670
Suddenly, she knocks on the door and the other
girls hide.

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.299
He gets a gun and opens the door to Thursday
standing there with a hurt hand.

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:51.290
She has lost the tip of her finger.

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.690
Terrence dresses her wound and scolds her.

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.379
When he's done with her hand, he calls Monday
and says that everything they do affects each

00:03:57.379 --> 00:03:58.379
other.

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:02.159
He cleans Monday's hand with alcohol, gives
her a shot, gets the cleaver, and sanitizes

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:03.390
it with fire.

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.870
What happens to one of them, happens to them
all.

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.510
He tells Monday to be brave and chops her
finger off.

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.480
At the present, it's a Monday.

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.209
The day's namesake is sick and Sunday holds
her head.

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:17.690
Later, Monday scans her vitals and uses the
information to apply her makeup.

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.709
She leaves the apartment and arrives at a
checkpoint to enter the sector where she works.

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:25.550
She's stopped by Adrian, who bitches how he
hates Mondays, but he's happy he gets to see

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:26.550
her.

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.480
She gets selected for questioning.

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.340
Adrian questions her on the spot and they
flirt a little, then he lets her proceed.

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.710
Monday enters the bank where she works and
is joined in the elevator by her colleague

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:36.710
Jerry.

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:39.860
They have an unpleasant conversation, where
he implies that he might know something about

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:40.860
her.

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:41.860
Monday is worried.

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.150
She doesn't come home that night and her sisters
are worried because she's not answering her

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:46.150
phone.

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:50.600
Friday checks her bracelet, but her GPS locator
is turned off and she can't find her.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.310
Tuesday is scared that she might be dead and
the authorities find her before they do.

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.500
She thinks their lives might be over too.

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.050
Saturday seems chill about her being late,
but Thursday comments that Monday has never

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:01.560
been late for a meeting.

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.010
The next day, Tuesday gets the scan.

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:06.790
Saturday reads her results and helps her get
ready.

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:09.430
Thursday is angry that she'd eat a magic brownie.

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:13.120
Tuesday says it's good for her nerves, especially
since Monday is gone.

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.320
Thursday tells her that she needs to act normal,
but she isn't so sure she can do that.

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.950
Tuesday steps off the elevator and Eddie tells
her that he didn't see her come in the previous

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:21.950
day.

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:24.560
She gets to the checkpoint and passes through
without a problem.

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:28.440
When she gets to the office, Tuesday puts
a communication device in her ear and talks

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.350
to her sisters, telling them that they got
the promotion.

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:35.020
Her assistant walks in and Tuesday asks when
she last synced her tablet because she forgot

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:36.220
to log off.

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:39.990
The assistant says that she left early to
celebrate at her favorite bar.

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:44.180
Tuesday goes to the bar and drinks with the
bartender, asking her about the previous night.

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:47.440
She says that she didn't stay long because
her colleague annoyed her.

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:51.509
Tuesday calls her sisters with what she found
out and Saturday says that Jerry knows.

00:05:51.509 --> 00:05:54.790
Thursday thinks that she should question him
because he might be the last person that saw

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:55.790
Monday.

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:58.990
Tuesday is stopped by agents from the Child
Allocation Bureau and they tell her to get

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:00.180
into a van.

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:04.260
Once inside, the officer scans her bracelet
and turns her GPS off.

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.229
Friday tells the others she lost her.

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:08.470
Tuesday is taken to the CAB headquarters.

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:11.039
Adrian sees her being walked inside for questioning.

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:13.819
She's taken into a room where Cayman is waiting
for her.

00:06:13.819 --> 00:06:16.830
Tuesday reluctantly shakes her hand and asks
why she's there.

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:21.340
The woman says that she's amazed she made
it that far, considering they were seven children.

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:24.830
Tuesday continues her rouse, but the agent
gives Cayman a file showing there are five

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:25.919
more sisters.

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:29.230
The woman asks if there is another way and
the agent tells her that there isn't if she

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:32.139
wants to keep it quiet, then takes out a knife.

00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:36.100
Tuesday tries to bargain with Cayman, but
she tells her that was what the last one said.

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:39.420
She doesn't come back that night either and
the others are restless and worried about

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:40.420
her.

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:42.289
Wednesday thinks they should go out and help
her.

00:06:42.289 --> 00:06:45.780
Suddenly, they see armed men on their security
cameras and freak out.

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:47.810
The men walk into the building and kill Eddie.

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:51.910
They use Tuesday's eye to get inside the apartment,
but they don't find anyone because the sisters

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:53.720
are hiding in their spot.

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:56.960
Thursday goes to get her father's gun, though
she finds the safe empty.

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:00.120
The men find the hiding spot and tell the
siblings to step out.

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:02.509
The main guy asks where the last one is.

00:07:02.509 --> 00:07:06.570
Suddenly, Thursday hits one of them over the
head and uses his body as a shield.

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:10.020
Wednesday attacks the agent closest to her
and fights him while Thursday incapacitates

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:11.069
another one.

00:07:11.069 --> 00:07:14.610
When she tries to shoot him the gun fails
and he fires at her, but Friday knocks him

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:16.020
out with a bookshelf.

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:18.210
He breaks out and takes down Friday.

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:21.731
Wednesday gets trashed in her fight and when
the main guy gets ready to kill her, Sunday

00:07:21.731 --> 00:07:23.810
throws boiling water on his face.

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:27.440
Saturday attacks him with an iron and tries
to strangle him with a chord, but he knocks

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:28.440
her out.

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:31.960
The main guy gets a knife and walks toward
Wednesday when she manages to make him topple

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:32.960
over.

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:35.180
Thursday fights with the other one for his
gun.

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:37.360
Eventually, she manages to kill him.

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:40.680
When the fight is over, the women see that
Sunday's shot in the gut.

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:43.669
She says that she doesn't know who she is,
then she dies.

00:07:43.669 --> 00:07:47.750
Meanwhile, Cayman visits a CAB holding facility
and tells the agent that she was assured that

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:49.260
the children won't suffer.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:53.080
The woman has begun to feel guilty about what
she has done, but the agent tells her that

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:56.599
the parents are the guilty ones and that she
is humanity's last hope.

00:07:56.599 --> 00:08:00.629
She springs back fast, telling the agent that
they must localize the Settman problem because

00:08:00.629 --> 00:08:04.250
the scandal of seven siblings surviving to
adulthood might ruin her.

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:08.340
Besides, there is another complication in
the situation, the fact that Jerry seems to

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:09.340
know.

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:11.520
Cayman tells him to deal with Jerry first.

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:15.250
Back at the apartment, Friday finds Tuesday's
eye in the main guy's pocket and they scan

00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:17.199
it to find out that it's hers.

00:08:17.199 --> 00:08:20.360
Midnight strikes and the sisters discuss what
they should do.

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:23.259
Thursday thinks that they need to come up
with a plan because somebody wants them to

00:08:23.259 --> 00:08:24.330
disappear.

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:28.150
The next day, Wednesday gets ready to leave
but doesn't don the Karen mask.

00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:32.050
Friday pins a camera on her sweater so they
can see and hear everything she does.

00:08:32.050 --> 00:08:35.050
Thursday gives her the gun even though they
can't unlock it and tells her to go to Jerry's

00:08:35.050 --> 00:08:37.120
to find out everything she can.

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:39.890
Wednesday exits their sector and proceeds
to his place.

00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:42.000
He opens the door and lets her enter.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
Cayman's agent has his scope set on him.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.790
Jerry asks her if their deal stands, but since
Wednesday doesn't know anything about it,

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:51.050
he tells her that she needs to pass on the
promotion so it goes to him and he'll keep

00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:52.089
her secret.

00:08:52.089 --> 00:08:54.950
She points the gun at him and asks how long
he's known.

00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:58.450
Jerry says that if he didn't find the contract
about the fund's transfer, she would've been

00:08:58.450 --> 00:08:59.800
in jail by then.

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:03.040
The contract was with Cayman, her new V.I.P.
client.

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:05.830
Wednesday asks to see the contract when Jerry
gets killed.

00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:09.279
The shooting continues, but Wednesday manages
to close the shutters.

00:09:09.279 --> 00:09:12.880
The rest of the agents go in after her and
an entire team shows up.

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:16.459
She asks her sisters where she should go,
but Friday can't help her.

00:09:16.459 --> 00:09:19.450
Wednesday hides in the bathroom while the
agents check the apartment.

00:09:19.450 --> 00:09:21.080
One of them enters the bathroom.

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:22.930
She struggles with him and kills him.

00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:26.080
The others hear them struggle, calling for
the agent inside.

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:29.520
When he doesn't answer they move in while
Wednesday figures out what to do.

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:32.530
She cuts his finger off and attaches it to
hers so she can use his rifle.

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:35.140
The agents enter and she kills both of them.

00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:38.930
The last one calls the boss, but she kills
him, sending him toppling over the building

00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:40.230
in front of the others.

00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:44.380
The rest of the agents move in as Friday finds
her a way out of the apartment through a window.

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:46.930
She lands in an empty dumpster and gets hurt.

00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:50.290
Wednesday still manages to get out and run
with the agents after her.

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:52.029
Friday takes her through a safe route.

00:09:52.029 --> 00:09:56.340
She runs into a building and the agents follow
her in but get attacked by the people inside.

00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:59.760
Wednesday escapes the building and almost
gets hit by the main agent's car.

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:02.220
She continues to run unaware that he's tracking
her.

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:05.450
The agents see her and fire, killing innocent
bystanders.

00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:09.000
Friday tells Wednesday that she needs to get
her on the roof to get her home from there.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
Suddenly, there's a knock on their door.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.840
It's Adrian, and the girls think it's the
CAB.

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:16.399
Wednesday is stuck until they figure out what
to do.

00:10:16.399 --> 00:10:19.519
Saturday gets ready to open the door and the
others hide.

00:10:19.519 --> 00:10:22.800
Adrian comments about her look, then tells
her that he was worried when he saw her at

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:23.910
the Bureau.

00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:26.660
She lies that she was there to drop off some
documents.

00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:28.140
He comes inside.

00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:31.620
Friday hangs up on Wednesday, leaving her
stranded with agents coming in.

00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:36.590
Meanwhile, Adrian makes a pass on Saturday,
but she panics and goes to the other room.

00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:39.720
Thursday thinks that she's the one who was
seeing him, but Saturday swears she hasn't

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:41.230
seen him before.

00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:44.110
Thursday tells her to get him back at his
place to find out which one of them he's been

00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:45.310
seeing.

00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:48.720
Friday puts a coupling device in her bracelet
so that she can get them access to the CAB

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:50.980
servers via Adrian's bracelet.

00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:54.589
Saturday confesses to her sisters that she's
afraid that he might figure out it's not the

00:10:54.589 --> 00:10:58.589
sister he's been seeing because she's a virgin,
but still changes outfits and leaves with

00:10:58.589 --> 00:10:59.589
him.

00:10:59.589 --> 00:11:03.360
Friday suddenly remembers Wednesday and tells
her where she can find access to the roof.

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:07.660
Wednesday runs there but realizes that she'll
have to make a huge jump to the other building.

00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:09.350
Thursday convinces her to jump.

00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:12.240
When she does, she gets shot midair by the
main agent.

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:16.160
She holds on to the roof, but he finishes
the job and sends the body to the processing

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:17.160
center.

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:19.790
Later, Saturday arrives at Adrian's apartment.

00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:22.500
She takes a shot of vodka and he kisses her.

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:26.040
Simultaneously, Friday looks through the contract
and finds out that Monday had transferred

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:29.640
millions to Nicolette Cayman's campaign on
the day they got the promotion.

00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:31.500
But she never managed to sign it.

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:35.140
Saturday couples with Adrian and simultaneously
couples with his bracelet.

00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:37.450
That allows Friday access to the CAB servers.

00:11:37.450 --> 00:11:41.440
The next day Friday and Thursday get into
the security feed of the processing center.

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:45.060
Suddenly, they see that one of them is alive
and they think it's Monday.

00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:48.790
Saturday wakes up next to Adrian and as he
gets dressed for work, he tells her that there

00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:50.810
is a big event for Cayman that night.

00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:54.459
She wonders why he works for the CAB considering
how they treat children.

00:11:54.459 --> 00:11:57.430
Adrian asks her if she's ever been to the
lower sectors and says that they're doing

00:11:57.430 --> 00:11:58.570
them a favor.

00:11:58.570 --> 00:12:02.920
As he's leaving he tells her that he wants
to be with her every day, not just Monday.

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:06.510
Adrian leaves and Saturday calls the others
so they all exchange what they found out about

00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:07.510
Monday.

00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:10.880
Thursday thinks that Adrian is playing them,
but Saturday doesn't think so.

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:15.370
Suddenly, agents appear in Adrian's apartment
and in front of the Settman apartment too.

00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:18.040
They kill Saturday and gas the Settman apartment.

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:21.470
Friday tries to download all of their data
from their entire lives as proof that they

00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:23.720
existed, but Thursday makes her leave.

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:27.519
The two escape through the fire escape and
Thursday touches down first.

00:12:27.519 --> 00:12:30.200
Friday rolls the stairs back and returns to
the apartment.

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:34.010
The agents are coming up the stairs and she
rigs the microwave to explode.

00:12:34.010 --> 00:12:37.990
Friday transfers all of the data to Thursday's
bracelet and tells her to get Monday.

00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:41.630
She says that it's okay that she has to die
because she wouldn't make it without them.

00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:45.850
The agents get ready to enter, she tells her
big sis she loves her and the microwave explodes

00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:47.830
taking out the entire floor.

00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:50.290
Thursday lost all of her sisters, save one.

00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:54.779
Meanwhile, Adrian hears about the explosion
over the radio and immediately goes there.

00:12:54.779 --> 00:12:57.980
He enters the building as they are taking
out Friday's body.

00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:00.040
Adrian thinks it's his Karen and freaks out.

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:03.740
He sees them take the body to the processing
center and gets back in his car where Thursday

00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:05.060
is waiting for him.

00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:08.720
She says that he sold them out, but he has
no idea what's going on.

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:12.110
Thursday doesn't believe that he doesn't know
who she is at first, but he figures it out

00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:13.839
and she confirms it for him.

00:13:13.839 --> 00:13:17.190
She tells him that the woman he slept with
and the one he saw in a body bag aren't his

00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:18.300
Karen.

00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:21.930
Thursday tells him that Monday, or rather
Karen is alive and being held in the processing

00:13:21.930 --> 00:13:22.930
center.

00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:26.600
He says that he loves Karen and Thursday tells
him that if he really does, he has to help

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:27.600
her.

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:28.600
She has a plan.

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:32.000
Later, a Settman body is being taken to processing.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.260
Adrian is the one taking the body in.

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:37.250
Simultaneously, the agents return to CAB.

00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:41.210
Adrian is being led inside the facility where
he transfers the body to the nurses.

00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:43.750
He sees them preparing a child for cryo-sleep.

00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:46.570
They get her inside the pod and give her a
sedative.

00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:48.760
Thursday sees the procedure from the body
bag.

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:52.320
The nurse locks in the pod and begins the
procedure which doesn't freeze the child but

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:53.940
burns it out of existence.

00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:56.339
The next pod appears and it's Thursday's turn.

00:13:56.339 --> 00:14:00.170
The nurse asks why the body isn't burned and
the agents find their men incapacitated in

00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:01.709
the back of a van.

00:14:01.709 --> 00:14:05.500
Thursday pushes the nurse inside the pod and
begins the procedure, while Adrian fights

00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:06.820
the men outside.

00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:10.180
Then Thursday struggles with the other nurse
and subdues him in the end.

00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:13.839
Neither of them can believe what Cayman has
done, she has killed them all.

00:14:13.839 --> 00:14:16.959
Thursday finds the room where they are keeping
Monday and they go after her.

00:14:16.959 --> 00:14:21.510
Once they go inside, however, Thursday realizes
that it's Tuesday and tells Adrian.

00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:24.010
They ask Tuesday what happened to Monday.

00:14:24.010 --> 00:14:28.690
Simultaneously, she walks into Cayman's office
and she asks her if she was enjoying her stay.

00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:30.699
Monday says she was more than comfortable.

00:14:30.699 --> 00:14:34.010
Cayman says that with Karen's donation and
her push for parliament they might still save

00:14:34.010 --> 00:14:35.010
the Earth.

00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:39.269
Meanwhile, Thursday tells Tuesday to take
the wig off because she has another plan.

00:14:39.269 --> 00:14:42.480
Monday is reluctant to sign the contract and
Cayman tells her that she kept one of her

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:45.980
siblings alive because someone willing to
give up their flesh and blood can never be

00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:47.279
fully trusted.

00:14:47.279 --> 00:14:51.209
She signs and Cayman asks her how it feels
to be the one and only Karen Settman.

00:14:51.209 --> 00:14:55.080
In the meantime, Thursday has already changed
into Karen and is telling Tuesday to get into

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:57.660
the main server before Cayman's speech.

00:14:57.660 --> 00:15:01.529
Adrian will take her there, while Thursday
goes to the event for Cayman's campaign.

00:15:01.529 --> 00:15:05.180
Tuesday and Adrien get to the server, pretending
that she has him hostage and make the guards

00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:06.399
open the door.

00:15:06.399 --> 00:15:10.500
He subdues them and they go inside with Tuesday
getting into the main server immediately.

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:14.400
The agents track them down there, so Adrian
tries to fight them off.

00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:17.420
Thursday is in the washroom when Monday walks
in and gets the gun out.

00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:20.329
At the same time, Tuesday accesses the live
feed.

00:15:20.329 --> 00:15:23.730
The main agent realizes he needs to get to
Cayman and leaves the others to deal with

00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:24.730
it.

00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:27.940
Thursday and Monday argue about the meaning
of family and sacrifice.

00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:31.670
Monday tells her that she fell in love with
Adrian and everything changed for her.

00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:35.130
Thursday makes a speech about how Karen Settman
belongs to all of them, but Monday tells her

00:15:35.130 --> 00:15:39.100
that as the firstborn she was the real Karen
and the rest were after birth.

00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:40.870
Thursday disarms her and they fight.

00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:44.570
In the meantime, Cayman begins her speech
about overpopulation and shows the audience

00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:45.940
her statistics.

00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:49.410
While that's happening, Adrian blocks the
agents from coming in and Thursday kicks the

00:15:49.410 --> 00:15:51.330
gun away as the two fight.

00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:54.250
Monday goes after it, but the fight continues
in a stall.

00:15:54.250 --> 00:15:58.320
At one point it looks like both Thursday and
Adrian are losing, as Tuesday finally uploads

00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:00.149
the processing video.

00:16:00.149 --> 00:16:02.820
Thursday and Monday are struggling for the
gun and it fires.

00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:04.399
One of them is dead.

00:16:04.399 --> 00:16:07.240
Adrian fights off the last remaining agent
and kills her.

00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:09.690
Cayman talks about the possibility of a better
future.

00:16:09.690 --> 00:16:13.760
A Settman sister walks into the hall of the
event and Tuesday plays the video.

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:17.690
It shows up on the main screen in the event
hall and everyone witnesses what child processing

00:16:17.690 --> 00:16:18.970
really means.

00:16:18.970 --> 00:16:23.230
Cayman says that they didn't suffer, then
realizes that the Settman sibling isn't Monday.

00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:25.720
She asks her if she knows what she has done.

00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:28.880
Monday appears but the main agents kill her
before she can shoot.

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:31.820
Then Adrian kills him and runs to Monday who's
still alive.

00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:35.759
She has a flashback of their grandfather crying
the day he chopped their fingers off.

00:16:35.759 --> 00:16:39.270
He tells her that he just wants to protect
them and apologizes to her.

00:16:39.270 --> 00:16:43.490
Thursday takes her hand and Monday begs her
to promise her not to let them take her children.

00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:45.350
Adrian comes to her side and she dies.

00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:48.570
Later, the child allocation act has been revoked.

00:16:48.570 --> 00:16:52.660
Children are being released from allocation
camps and pregnant women come out of hiding.

00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:55.829
Cayman holds a press conference and asks who
will make the difficult decisions that will

00:16:55.829 --> 00:16:57.980
ensure the survival of humanity.

00:16:57.980 --> 00:17:01.420
She only regrets that their children won't
know the world they could've built together.

00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:05.929
Thursday, Tuesday, and Adrian are watching
Monday's babies being taken to term in a medical

00:17:05.929 --> 00:17:07.209
facility.

00:17:07.209 --> 00:17:10.510
Tuesday says that she has chosen the name
Terry and Thursday tell Adrian to call her

00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:11.720
Karen Settman.

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:18.220
They have come to realize that Monday did
it all for them so they can be safe.
