00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:10.800
What happens when humans and aliens are forced&nbsp;
to live with each other well the movie district 9&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.720
illustrates that perfectly well let me explain out&nbsp;
of nowhere aliens have landed above johannesburg&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.520
their spacecraft has hovered above the city for&nbsp;
three months without any sort of interaction&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.640
as a natural response the humans have decided&nbsp;
to make the first move they broke into the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.160
spacecraft and could identify over one million&nbsp;
aliens it turns out that their spacecraft is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.520
broken they are legit stuck on earth and are&nbsp;
unable to continue their journey across space&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:42.800
after the collection of nearby cctv footage&nbsp;
it's known that a large part of the ship&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.400
presumably an important piece of tech has fallen&nbsp;
off this piece of tech is thought to be the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:54.560
solution to fix the problem our character Wikus is&nbsp;
working for the MNU multinational united a weapons&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.560 --> 00:01:00.320
manufacturer that is responsible for guarding the&nbsp;
aliens and maintaining peace between the races&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.680
all 1 million aliens live in the slum area&nbsp;
of district 9 an exclusive alien zone that is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:11.200
off limits for humans however there are human&nbsp;
criminals living in these zones as well they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:18.480
mainly engage in criminal activity like weapon&nbsp;
trade gambling and yes interracial prostitution&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:24.480
as well as of late Wikus is responsible for&nbsp;
managing the eviction of District 9 the plan&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.840
is to move them over to the newer and bigger&nbsp;
district 10. easier said than done threats are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.360
present everywhere within district 9. it is hardly&nbsp;
possible to survive there without armed security&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.320
now Wikus goes from house to house knocking&nbsp;
on doors and handing over papers to be signed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.520
however aliens and humans can't communicate&nbsp;
meaning most understanding is based on human&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:52.080
interpretation and we know that sucks Wikus is&nbsp;
a hyperactive bureaucrat of course that like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:57.840
most humans look down on the aliens he enjoys&nbsp;
his new position of power and doesn't shy away&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.360
from showing it off when he passes by a house&nbsp;
that is located within the eviction zone of today&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:09.200
two aliens are brewing a mysterious liquid inside&nbsp;
when Wikus makes contact one of the aliens flees&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.640
through the back door the other one steps out&nbsp;
upon searching the house he finds a cylinder&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:21.840
and fiddles around with it don't touch what isn't&nbsp;
yours my friends you know i don't trust anything&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:28.720
you're right yep i'll skip the meal for today&nbsp;
thank you very much and i apologize to you out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:34.480
there anyway this guy is extremely confident with&nbsp;
his new job the way he goes through this stuff&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.360
makes it look like he knows exactly what he's&nbsp;
doing but that's all for show the aliens that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:46.480
were experimenting in here were according to wikus&nbsp;
at least criminals in fact every alien to him is a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.920
criminal surprise surprise he is as ignorant&nbsp;
as you would imagine a bureaucrat would be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.400
commissioned with the job to establish a mutual&nbsp;
relationship between a race that he doesn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:02.240
bother to understand inside the house the alien&nbsp;
with the red vest lives with his kid wikus shows&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:07.600
his true colors he is humiliating the alien and&nbsp;
threatens to take away his child for no reason&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.480
upon entering the shack he finds various&nbsp;
electronics to him proof of criminal activity&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:18.160
which obviously is ridiculous but to him it&nbsp;
makes perfect sense before he can clear the space&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:25.120
he breaks into puke festival i wonder why his&nbsp;
temperature rises and his overall health declines&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:31.840
some people would say well deserved however as the&nbsp;
day passes his health gets even worse he is dizzy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.680
his nose emits black fluid and his fingernails&nbsp;
start to fall off something isn't right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.400
question what is worse than having a bad day&nbsp;
at work coming home from it while your wife&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.360
has prepared a surprise party thank you wife&nbsp;
let's have some cake and tea with your family&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:52.320
now Wikus is not doing well during the party he&nbsp;
eventually faints and is brought to the hospital&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:57.360
his arm that was injured during today is badly&nbsp;
inflamed as the doctor unwraps his bandage he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:04.000
gets a shock of a lifetime wikus' arm has turned&nbsp;
into an alien limp it can't get more surreal mere&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.120
moments later troops storm in and take in Wikus&nbsp;
while evacuating the whole place as of now he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:14.960
is treated like he was treating the aliens alright&nbsp;
this is bad once you are caught by a government or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:19.920
military good luck escaping he should have taken&nbsp;
his symptoms more serious and contacted people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:24.480
and trust about his condition he should have made&nbsp;
sure that the footage that shows his contamination&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:30.160
is securely stored because what happens next is&nbsp;
that the MNU fabricates fake news about how he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:35.360
got contaminated skewing the picture and making&nbsp;
it much much harder for him to survive and get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:41.280
appropriate help he wakes up in a lab lying on a&nbsp;
flat surface various tests are performed his body&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:52.800
is thoroughly scanned and he realizes that this&nbsp;
thing is the reason for his transformation [ __ ]

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.520
now what do you do in this situation i reckon&nbsp;
there isn't much that you can do however the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:03.200
alien weapons that the humans have collected&nbsp;
over the years can't be used by humans therefore&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:08.880
Wikus is a perfect trial the weapons require a&nbsp;
biological compatibility that normal humans just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:14.720
don't possess however now that wikus is slowly&nbsp;
becoming an alien he is the perfect candidate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:19.840
to explore these weapons he is forced into&nbsp;
questionable trials and tortured if he doesn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:25.840
comply he is soaked in sweat miserable is the best&nbsp;
term to describe this situation when they bring in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:31.200
an alive alien and force wikus to shoot at him he&nbsp;
doesn't want to he's starting to feel compassion&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:36.720
with these aliens slowly understanding what&nbsp;
these entities have to go through on daily basis&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:41.360
when his life is about to be taken as well he&nbsp;
takes the last chance and leaps at the doctors&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:47.200
resulting in his escape but where can he go his&nbsp;
face is basically on every tv channel and every&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:52.880
newspaper the whole world is looking for him the&nbsp;
only place where he will be safe is ironically&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:58.400
enough District 9 itself his body by now is&nbsp;
changing rapidly his taste buds have already&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:04.960
adapted and uh his new food of choice is cat food&nbsp;
you know could be worse if you need to escape the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:10.960
situation i would suggest you get off the main&nbsp;
land steal a boat some food and off you go you do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:16.000
not want to be a lab rat right and if that means&nbsp;
you will have to starve in loneliness then i think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.520
we can all agree that this is better on a nice&nbsp;
island than in a dark alleyway covered in trash&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:26.400
he eventually hides in one of the alien shacks&nbsp;
not knowing that this is the same place where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:32.400
he harassed an alien family yesterday things are&nbsp;
turning interesting he begs them to let him stay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:37.520
but naturally the alien doesn't really like that&nbsp;
underneath the floor is a secret lab containing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:42.640
high technology the important piece of tech&nbsp;
responsible for the spaceship to function properly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:49.040
is also down there this alien family apparently&nbsp;
scientists are trying to fix it and the cylinder&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:55.840
that wikus had found is the key so basically&nbsp;
all these aliens want is to fix their ship&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:01.440
and leave the planet earth this is also in the&nbsp;
interest of humanity right however with all these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:08.000
restrictions laws and observed bureaucracy this is&nbsp;
almost impossible now wikus finds out that his arm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.760
can be reversed but the only way to do that is to&nbsp;
recover the cylinder that he has basically stolen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:19.520
two days ago making his situation even more absurd&nbsp;
a sweet scene that we encounter here that i want&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:25.840
to mention is that the alien child is intrigued&nbsp;
by wikus arm he stretches out his next to wikus&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:32.320
trying to say hey look we aren't that different&nbsp;
implying that racism is always just a choice&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:38.400
but wikus being the selfish and opportunistic&nbsp;
person that he is pushes away the kid however that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:44.720
is possible i don't know all that he wants is his&nbsp;
old life not understanding that to achieve that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:50.160
he might need to give something in return if i&nbsp;
were him i would team up with these aliens form&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:55.520
an alien militant group arm myself with these&nbsp;
super weapons and then storm the MNU i would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:55.520 --> 00:08:00.320
hijack that cylinder fix the ship and then leave&nbsp;
earth together with these aliens because that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:05.760
ladies and gentlemen would be a win-win situation&nbsp;
however if you are more of an alien pacifist which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:11.040
is fine as well then you could try to mediate&nbsp;
between the races right if you can get out a video&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:15.680
message telling your story and that the aliens&nbsp;
are actually trying to fix their ship and leave&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:21.840
but the MNU doesn't let that happen the global&nbsp;
outcry would be massive change would be inevitable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:27.280
it might not be tomorrow but it sure as hell would&nbsp;
lead to a sooner happy end but anyway wikus hasn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:32.240
made up his mind yet and leaves but during the&nbsp;
following night he gets a shock of a lifetime&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:37.360
when he undresses himself he sees that his&nbsp;
transformation is moving forward quicker than he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:42.640
thought if i were in this situation i would either&nbsp;
kill myself or like mentioned team up with the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:49.040
alien family because they seem to be legit cool&nbsp;
beings now here's where stuff becomes cool wikus&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:54.000
decide to team up with them anyway the plan is&nbsp;
to enter the mnu facility and steal the cylinder&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.440
with the black fluid inside to do that they need&nbsp;
guns so what wikus does is ask for help from the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:05.200
nigerian gangsters so far so good i would do the&nbsp;
same thing but when he arrives he isn't welcomed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:10.880
very nicely he's almost killed but the mob boss is&nbsp;
intrigued by wikus' arm asking him how he achieved&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:16.560
this this dude wants nothing more than to become&nbsp;
an alien himself that is some crazy enthusiasm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:22.880
and in all actuality a very important aspect that&nbsp;
wikus doesn't take any leverage of so what happens&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:28.160
is this wikus who is about to get killed grabs&nbsp;
one of the ratchet and clank weapons lying next by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:33.200
he shoots his oppressors down gaining him the&nbsp;
respect that he deserves the mob boss asks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:38.720
wikus how he got transformed but our character&nbsp;
just ignores that question and flees now in my&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:43.920
opinion this was a huge mistake what i would&nbsp;
have done is the following i would have hired&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:48.960
these militants for my mission promising that if&nbsp;
they can get us a cylinder we would help them to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:55.520
turn into aliens which as we all know is entirely&nbsp;
possible we are the living proof boom let's go&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:55.520 --> 00:10:01.120
but wikus doesn't think that far nope what he&nbsp;
does is he teams up with the red vest alien and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:07.600
storms to MNU in tag team fashion because why&nbsp;
not things are getting fun i'm gonna find him

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:16.160
equipped with the coolest weapons of the&nbsp;
galaxy the duo moves in wikus still remembers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:21.120
the security code so entering the base isn't&nbsp;
the problem the soldiers they face off are no&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:26.080
problem either since they have superior weapons as&nbsp;
they move in and get to the underground lab where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:31.040
aliens are experimented on they start to look for&nbsp;
the cylinder however our body is shocked by what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:35.920
he sees the cruelty is too much for him he can't&nbsp;
understand why this has happened to his species&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:40.880
it was only a malfunction that made them land&nbsp;
here and no ill intent wikus finds the cylinder&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:46.080
but at the same time a squad of elite soldiers are&nbsp;
storming the lab a hefty fight breaks out it takes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:51.680
a couple of moments until our friend can get a&nbsp;
grip and both of our characters can escape with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:57.040
a self-made alien grenade they make it through&nbsp;
the car park hijacking an suv and then rush back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:03.600
to district 9. things are about to turn around&nbsp;
but not before wikus once again screws things up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:08.400
once they make it back home wikus demands for&nbsp;
his arm to be reversed the alien tells him though&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:13.520
that this isn't that simple and it will need&nbsp;
some time namely three years now wikus can't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:18.720
believe it and doesn't want to accept it but&nbsp;
in my humble opinion three years is rather okay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:24.560
no i mean the most important thing for now is to&nbsp;
get out of here alive anyway this discussion can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:29.680
be continued later on there are still a few dozen&nbsp;
soldiers behind us trying to murder us however&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:34.640
wikus and his anger problem aren't rational&nbsp;
he grabs a piece of wood and slams our friend&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:39.680
over the head causing him to faint Wikus&nbsp;
enters the basement and shuts out the alien&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:44.720
the soldiers enter and take him captive but&nbsp;
he is an amazing guy and doesn't snitch on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:49.760
us probably because his child is down here with&nbsp;
us seeing this little alien being worried sick&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:55.200
about his dad upstairs is heartbreaking at this&nbsp;
moment i just hope so bad for a happy ending&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:59.280
in any way wikus activates a small&nbsp;
spacecraft and prepares for an escape

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:10.640
that is ridiculous okay this is a very dumb&nbsp;
move how could he possibly maneuver that thing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:15.840
without any knowledge and that is exactly what&nbsp;
happens he gets shot down within the first minute&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:21.360
and crashes down to earth this spacecraft&nbsp;
ladies and gentlemen was the only hope&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:29.120
for peace there was but one man is enough to f-&nbsp;
things up thank you thank you very much Wikus the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:33.920
best solution would have been clearly to enter the&nbsp;
basement with the alien body and escape together&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:39.200
and only then proceed with everything else so at&nbsp;
this point everything seems lost the alien and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:44.800
wikus himself were captured and transported&nbsp;
away but luckily we got the Nigerian gangs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:50.400
right the gang from before cuts off the escape&nbsp;
route and hijacks both convoys a fight breaks out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:55.840
but eventually they're able to capture wikus and&nbsp;
take him back to their mob boss things are getting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:55.840 --> 00:13:00.960
messy who are the good guys and who are not in&nbsp;
any way though i would prefer to mingle with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:06.240
those Nigerians any day than those MNU bastards&nbsp;
but before wikus gets eaten up because of some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:11.920
voodoo [ __ ] maybe i reconsider the alien child&nbsp;
back in the small spacecraft activates a remote&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:17.040
control system that moves a mother ship into a&nbsp;
position directly over the smaller spacecraft&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:23.120
this kid is awesome at the same time the alien&nbsp;
weapons within the Nigerian HQ start to activate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:29.600
themselves as well a huge robot becomes alive and&nbsp;
well cleans the place swiftly and thoroughly only&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:35.200
wikus is spared since according to the robot at&nbsp;
least he is a peer then the robot opens its doors&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:41.520
and basically insists on him entering it wikus&nbsp;
hesitates i wonder why why would you hesitate to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:47.120
enter that robot nothing can stop you while you&nbsp;
wear it why wouldn't you want to become a gundam&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:53.600
jesus well in any way wikus can't resist the&nbsp;
urge because we can understand and it's showtime

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:04.720
he smashes his opponents as if they were kitchen&nbsp;
flies given me the satisfaction that i've been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:10.320
looking for 1 hour and 29 minutes thank you he&nbsp;
rescues his alien friend and they make it over&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:16.240
to the spacecraft where the little kid is waiting&nbsp;
how about that things are about to change and i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:21.440
love it but even though wikus has been a story&nbsp;
for the most part of this story he at least does&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:26.880
the right thing when it becomes necessary thumbs&nbsp;
up for that before they arrive at the spacecraft&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:32.080
and the family reunites again Wikus leaves and&nbsp;
enters the combat again trying to make up some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:37.600
time for his alien friends now they activate the&nbsp;
beam of flight that slowly beams the spacecraft&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:43.360
up to the mothership the question though remains&nbsp;
can they make it in time well wikus is fighting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:48.000
desperately his only goal by now is to save&nbsp;
those that have helped him during his most&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.760
difficult times and he achieves that the alien&nbsp;
family eventually makes it into safety up above&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:53.760 --> 00:15:00.080
they activate the mothership and leave for now&nbsp;
i can't wait for district 10 at the same time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:05.120
though wikus is being slowly killed off in the&nbsp;
last showdown he faces off the elite soldier&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:10.160
that has made his life miserable but before&nbsp;
he can finish him off Wikus' new peers jump in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:15.920
and rip apart his enemy in one of the ending&nbsp;
scenes we can see a prawn scavenging the trash&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:21.040
place which implies that this is probably wikus&nbsp;
himself by now well i guess we'll find out in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:26.720
district 10 which has been confirmed just recently&nbsp;
so i hope you enjoyed this video i love this&nbsp;&nbsp;
