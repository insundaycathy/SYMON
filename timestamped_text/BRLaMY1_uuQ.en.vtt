00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:01.500
Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:06.310
Today, I’m going to explain a crime, drama,
and fantasy film called, “Border.”

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:07.529
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:09.330
Watch out and take care.

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.000
&nbsp;
In the Port of Gothenburg, Sweden, an extraordinary

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.560
woman, Tina, who has a seemingly odd interest
in insects, has distinctive Neanderthalic

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.690
facial features, brought by a rare case of
chromosomal abnormality, a disorder that makes

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:24.710
her open to unpleasant stares from other people,
especially during her day job.

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.000
Despite her condition and appearance, Tina
excels in her work and is respected by her

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.080
colleagues.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.180
Due to the abnormal mutation of her chromosomes,
Tina is gifted with super heightened olfactory

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.850
senses, comparable to a trained K-9 dog unit
that can detect contrabands about hundreds

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:38.240
of meters away.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.910
One day, during her shift, Tina calls one
of the passengers’ attention.

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.630
She confiscates his bag, hands it over to
her colleague, and without even opening it,

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:48.910
she declares that there are four liters of
liquor inside the young man’s bag.

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.280
Unimpressed by her demonstration, the young
passenger protests that he has legally bought

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.280
the liquor.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.290
Tina calmly tells him about the charges that
he will be dealing with for possessing liquor

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:57.739
at a minor age.

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:01.809
Caught red-handed, the young passenger immediately
takes his leave without an argument.

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:03.770
&nbsp;
Past her shift, Tina drives home to her secluded

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:05.130
house in the woods.

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:09.650
She lives with her boyfriend, Roland, a dog
trainer, who often keeps his dogs away from

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.840
her because of the inexplicable hostility
of the animals towards her.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.360
Exasperated by the usual scene inside the
house, Tina decides to take a walk around

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:17.590
the woods.

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.460
&nbsp;
The next morning, Tina goes to work on a seemingly

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:20.790
typical day.

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.450
Doing her usual checks, she sniffs on each
person, waiting for some unusual smell that

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.220
she can point out to intercept.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.140
One of the passengers, a very unsuspecting
man wearing a decent suit, catches Tina’s

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:31.140
attention.

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.330
She calls the man for inspection.

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.049
Her colleague makes the initial bag check
but finds nothing suspicious inside it.

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:38.880
Looking apprehensive, Tina suddenly asks for
his cellphone.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.189
The man refuses and asserts that he has no
room for any more delays.

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:44.229
Tina and her colleague insist.

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:47.150
Leaving him without a choice, the man compels
to get checked.

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.369
After sniffing closely on his cellphone, Tina
removes the memory card.

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.450
Suddenly, the man panics, snatches the memory
card from Tina’s hands and puts it inside

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.280
of his mouth in an attempt to swallow it.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.600
Luckily, Tina’s colleague is quick enough
to hold the man’s cheeks, preventing him

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.800
from causing any damage to the card.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.950
Then he holds the man down just as the other
security personnel takes the memory card out

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:05.950
of his mouth.&nbsp;

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.590
&nbsp;
Still in a state of disbelief about the earlier

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.129
scene, Tina returns to her post just as the
newly arriving passengers are coming out from

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.459
the terminal again.

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:16.019
Suddenly, she smells an alluring scent among
all of the passengers who came out, but none

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:17.489
of them seem to match.

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:20.269
Then from a distance, the last passenger finally
comes out.

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:24.189
A strange man named Vore passes in front of
her, bearing the same facial features the

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:25.659
same as hers.&nbsp;

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:27.450
&nbsp;
Tina calls him for inspection.

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.530
As Tina checks inside his bag, she finds ordinary
belongings except for a container of litterfalls

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.569
and a modified stainless box with a thermometer
and some wires attached to it.

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:38.919
Suspicious of the device, Tina asks for its
purpose just as she opens the box to find

00:02:38.919 --> 00:02:42.019
more dried leaves, some maggots, and some
resting pupas.

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:45.779
Vore explains that the device is a larvae
hatcher and he uses it for his job.

00:02:45.779 --> 00:02:49.510
Then he tries to make a conversation by asking
her whether she likes insects as well.

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.180
Drawn by his scent, Tina is unable to answer.

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.799
She avoids the conversation and directs him
to the exits.

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:57.510
Vore is too cunning to miss Tina’s affinity
towards him.

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.809
Just before he goes, he mischievously tells
Tina how sure he is that she also likes insects.

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:05.019
Showing his marvel to know that fact, Tina
remains standing speechless while looking

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:06.199
at him leave.

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:08.180
&nbsp;
Later, Tina visits her dad at the nursing

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:09.180
home.

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.120
She greets him enthusiastically, but her dad,
who is suffering from dementia, doesn’t

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.290
recognize her at all.

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.760
As Tina approaches closer, he finally recognizes
his own daughter.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.049
She brings him outside in a wheelchair and
arrives at their favorite spot.

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:24.430
Her dad starts the conversation by asking
how things are doing with Roland.

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.540
He notices how spiritless Tina is, so he bluntly
asks about their romance in bed.

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.599
Tina feels awkward and avoids the question.

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:34.510
Tina’s dad then points out how Roland is
just using her for his own advantage.

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.930
She defends this by saying that she needs
Roland to look after her house whenever she’s

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:38.930
gone.

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.230
Deep inside, Tina is aware of the reality
of how Roland sees her as a being, but she

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:43.930
tries to turn a blind eye.

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.129
As she arrives home, she tries to make a conversation
with Ronald.

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:51.049
He tries to engage, but his attention is evidently
more on the television than with her.

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:54.920
Tired of all the pretense, Tina decides to
take a walk outside instead.

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.540
The next day, Tina is invited by Agent Agneta
to talk about her discovery of the memory

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:00.890
card the other day.

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:04.529
Agneta tells her that the card contains illegal
and explicit videos and asks Tina how she

00:04:04.529 --> 00:04:07.709
happens to know about the contents of the
card without even seeing the man for the first

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:08.709
time.

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:12.309
Tina explains that she really doesn’t know
what was on the card, but instead, she explains

00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:14.479
how she can smell anxiety all over the suspect.

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:18.049
Agneta feels skeptical about her story, but
Tina further explains how she can perceive

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:21.150
things other than the tangible ones through
her sense of smell.

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.620
Gifted with phenomenal olfactory senses, Tina
can perceive the intangible such as human

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:29.800
emotions by smelling them — such as guilt,
shame, anger, fear, and even deception.

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.150
Now believing in her story, Agent Agneta stops
her interrogation.

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.690
Later on, she requests Tina’s help to solve
the underlying case just as she briefs her

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:38.270
on the proceedings.

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.530
&nbsp;
The following day, Vore, coming from another

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.689
trip, returns to the port and passes by Tina’s
post again.

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:47.250
He smiles and greets her and voluntarily surrenders
himself for inspection.

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.820
As Tina’s colleague thoroughly checks inside
Vore’s bag, he finds nothing suspicious.

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.760
Tina’s colleague declares him clean; however,
Tina insists that he’s got something on

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.710
him, so they decide to proceed to the next
course of action which is to strip-search

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:58.710
Vore.

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:02.100
However, after the search, Tina’s colleague
confirms that Vore is clean.

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:05.120
He then expresses his disappointment at Tina
for being compelled to conduct the search

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:09.100
instead of her after finding a very long embarrassing
scar on Vore’s tailbone and subsequently

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.479
discovering that Vore has female genitals.

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:15.210
Uncertain of how she should feel, Tina is
caught between feeling sorry and joyful.

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:18.199
Her remorse comes from the fact that they
have violated his civic rights, but at the

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:21.509
same time, her joy comes from the thought
that she can finally unveil the mystery of

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:24.590
her being for the first time with the help
of Vore who happens to be very similar to

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:25.590
her.

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:27.960
Tina then marches towards Vore to apologize.

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.650
She tells him that he can file a formal complaint
against her.

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:33.520
Vore shows his kindness by refusing to file
a complaint.

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:36.590
Tina pushes his kindness and asks him about
his personal life.

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:40.819
He generously responds that he travels a lot
and doesn’t stay in one place to study insects.

00:05:40.819 --> 00:05:44.150
As they continue to converse, they end up
introducing themselves to one another.

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:48.090
Tina’s curiosity about herself grows even
fonder after talking with Vore.

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:50.750
She then visits her dad to confront him about
her scars.

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:53.910
Her dad tells her that she got her scars when
she was three after falling down from a tree

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:55.729
and landing on a sharp rock.

00:05:55.729 --> 00:05:59.169
After hearing her dad’s story, she feels
unsatisfied with his tale.&nbsp;

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:03.669
The following day, Tina goes over to Vore’s
hostel, determined to find some real answers.

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:06.750
Outside his hostel, Tina finds him collecting
maggots on a tree.

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:09.630
He approaches her and invites her to try his
newly collected maggot.

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:13.659
Tina declines in disgust, but Vore insists
as he feeds the maggot on her mouth.

00:06:13.659 --> 00:06:17.080
As Tina devours the small maggot, she feels
a little satisfaction.

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:20.969
As she indulges herself with the guilty pleasure,
she becomes more concerned and insecure towards

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:21.969
herself.

00:06:21.969 --> 00:06:24.819
In order for her to know more about the truth
of her identity, she invites Vore to stay

00:06:24.819 --> 00:06:26.520
at her place.

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:28.020
&nbsp;
Arriving at Tina’s place, Vore approaches

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:31.669
the barking dogs and shows an aggressive snarl
like of a prominent wild beast, turning the

00:06:31.669 --> 00:06:32.999
dogs submissive.

00:06:32.999 --> 00:06:37.150
Tina is astonished by what she has seen, then
she feels confident and secure with Vore’s

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:38.150
presence.

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:39.620
She then introduces Vore to Roland.

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:43.240
Tina informs Roland that he will be occupying
the vacant house next to them.

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:47.819
Since Vore is already at their place, Roland
is unable to object to Tina’s sudden decision.

00:06:47.819 --> 00:06:49.849
&nbsp;
The next day, Tina accompanies a police agent

00:06:49.849 --> 00:06:51.680
to investigate the suspects.

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:55.250
She sees a man walking inside an apartment
and senses the unusual smell of explicitness

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:56.719
and shame on the man.

00:06:56.719 --> 00:06:59.789
They follow him inside but are unable to conduct
their search.

00:06:59.789 --> 00:07:03.370
Before the occupants close their doors, Tina
and her colleague hear a baby’s cry.

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:06.789
They return to the station to report on their
investigation but end up getting reprimanded

00:07:06.789 --> 00:07:08.490
by Agneta for being careless.

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:12.460
Tina asserts that she is 100% sure that the
couple will be violating the infant and insists

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:14.009
on busting their apartment.

00:07:14.009 --> 00:07:17.930
The police agent who is with Tina confirms
that he has also heard a baby crying; however,

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:21.099
because of lack of evidence, he explains that
they cannot just barge in without any proof

00:07:21.099 --> 00:07:23.319
or documents to support their operation.

00:07:23.319 --> 00:07:25.719
Tina concedes and goes home frustrated.

00:07:25.719 --> 00:07:27.629
&nbsp;
Tina spends her time alone, picking mushrooms

00:07:27.629 --> 00:07:28.629
in the woods.

00:07:28.629 --> 00:07:31.580
Coincidentally, Vore is also there picking
the same mushrooms.

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:35.020
Tina compliments the surroundings and tells
Vore how everything looks like in the fairy

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:36.020
tales.

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:38.810
Then she starts to share about her childhood
and how she thinks of being special among

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:42.220
the rest of the kids but ends up realizing
to be only a mere human with a chromosome

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:44.340
flaw that makes her different from the rest.

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:47.850
She continues to explain that aside from her
unusual appearance, she is also suffering

00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:51.620
from infertility because of disorganized placements
of her reproductive organs.

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:54.529
Vore remarks that she is different because
she is better than the rest of them and tells

00:07:54.529 --> 00:07:56.720
her not to listen to what humans say.

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:58.669
&nbsp;
On that day, Vore discovers that one of Tina’s

00:07:58.669 --> 00:08:00.849
neighbors just recently delivered a child.

00:08:00.849 --> 00:08:04.139
He goes to see the neighbors as he makes an
excuse to borrow a saucepan.

00:08:04.139 --> 00:08:08.139
Being invited inside, he goes to see the newborn
baby, acting all malicious as he compliments

00:08:08.139 --> 00:08:09.169
the child.

00:08:09.169 --> 00:08:12.319
Later that night, Vore is feeling restless
inside his cabin.

00:08:12.319 --> 00:08:15.629
As the night gradually becomes deeper, the
more he becomes disturbed.

00:08:15.629 --> 00:08:19.039
He goes into the woods as he experiences unusual
pain in his gut.

00:08:19.039 --> 00:08:21.759
Feeling agitated, he moves deeper into the
woods.

00:08:21.759 --> 00:08:25.090
Unable to contain the pain, Vore stops and
removes his pants while his reproductive organ

00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:28.899
protrudes between his legs as if giving birth,
as he screams more in pain.

00:08:28.899 --> 00:08:30.729
&nbsp;
The following morning, Tina and the police

00:08:30.729 --> 00:08:33.060
agent are on a stakeout for the suspects.

00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:36.479
The agent explains the suspects’ usual routine
and tells Tina that they only have an hour

00:08:36.479 --> 00:08:39.019
to break into their apartment to collect evidence.

00:08:39.019 --> 00:08:42.510
After they enter, they see nothing out of
the ordinary; however, using her extraordinary

00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:46.670
olfactory senses, Tina moves directly towards
a bookshelf and opens a trophy, finding a

00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:49.610
camera and discovering footage of a baby being
abused.

00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:53.691
Presenting all the evidence in the interrogation
room, the suspects deny the accusation, leaving

00:08:53.691 --> 00:08:56.380
Tina to feel strong resentment towards them.

00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:58.450
&nbsp;
One day, a thunderstorm approaches.

00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:01.560
Tina is busy pulling the wires out from the
outlets as she moves around the house in a

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:02.620
panic.

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:05.880
Then she sees Vore standing in front of her
door, looking anxious towards the upcoming

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:06.880
storm.

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:10.079
Just as she opens the door to let Vore in,
the storm suddenly breaks as the two of them

00:09:10.079 --> 00:09:13.540
quickly huddle under the table, terrified
with every strike of lightning.

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:17.930
They then move outside after the storm clears,
and Vore suddenly kisses Tina to her surprise.

00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:21.370
Tina shows aggression towards Vore like a
wild animal, snarling and sticking her tongue

00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:22.370
out.

00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:25.380
Vore smiles in gratification for he knows
it is how their kind shows affection towards

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:27.470
their partner when they are ready to mate.

00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:30.839
Acting like wild animals as a sign of their
intimacy, they end up arousing themselves

00:09:30.839 --> 00:09:33.570
and spend the whole day consummating one another.

00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:35.240
&nbsp;
After long hours of intimate moments, Vore

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:37.740
tells the confused Tina about her real identity.

00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:40.370
He reveals that Tina is a troll just like
he is.

00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:43.130
He explains that everything that is happening
to her doesn’t have anything to do about

00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:47.040
chromosomal abnormality; but it’s her ability
as a troll to acquire a heightened sense of

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:50.300
smell, just like the animals in the wild,
and the scar on her tailbone used to be her

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:52.130
tail that was removed from her.

00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:55.320
As Tina shows admiration towards Vore’s
words, he finally tells her that he is in

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:59.200
search of a specific group of trolls that
maintains a furtive existence in Finland.

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:02.820
He then asks her if she wants to go with him
to Finland to which Tina agrees.

00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:06.779
The next morning, excited about her newfound
identity, Tina restarts her life like a troll

00:10:06.779 --> 00:10:07.990
in the wild.

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:11.380
Carefree from all the trivial matters in life,
the two of them run within the confines of

00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:12.380
the woods.

00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:15.160
Tina asks Vore why he didn’t tell her for
so long.

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:18.410
Vore explains how hesitant he was to tell
her from the start, knowing how perfectly

00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:20.260
she has adapted to human life.

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:23.990
Nonetheless, Vore reveals the cruelty humans
committed against their kind.

00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:27.339
He shares about his parents and how other
troll captives became test subjects for human

00:10:27.339 --> 00:10:29.649
research which ultimately killed a lot of
them.

00:10:29.649 --> 00:10:32.339
Vore then swears his vengeance against the
humans.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:32.339 --> 00:10:34.300
&nbsp;
Tina decides to visit her dad again to confront

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:35.589
him about the truth.

00:10:35.589 --> 00:10:39.660
Arriving at the nursing home, Tina wakes her
dad and starts to ask about her real identity.

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:42.080
Her dad adheres to his fabricated stories.

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:46.250
She starts to get angry and her dad gets terrified
and immediately shouts to call the nurse’s

00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:47.250
attention.

00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:49.360
Just as the nurse arrives, Tina is directed
to leave.

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:51.800
&nbsp;
Tina arrives home feeling upset.

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:54.750
She casts Roland out as she throws his things
outside the house.

00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:58.330
Petrified of what Tina has become, Roland
leaves in the morning, bringing only his dogs

00:10:58.330 --> 00:10:59.399
with him.

00:10:59.399 --> 00:11:02.310
After seeing Roland leave, she goes to see
Vore at his cabin.

00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:05.730
She notices that no one is around, so she
enters of her own volition.

00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:09.949
Inside, she hears an indistinct sound of a
baby that is coming from the refrigerator.

00:11:09.949 --> 00:11:11.930
She opens the fridge and sees a box.

00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:15.430
As she takes the box out, the baby’s cry
becomes more conspicuous.

00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:17.670
She then opens it and finds a deformed infant.

00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:21.620
To her surprise, she immediately returns the
baby back inside the fridge, keeping the discovery

00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:22.720
to herself.

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:25.029
&nbsp;
Meanwhile, one of the suspects is being transported

00:11:25.029 --> 00:11:26.470
to a new location.

00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:30.190
Along the way, they suddenly stop for a wild
moose who is standing on the road.

00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:33.630
As they wait for the moose to make its way,
Vore suddenly appears from behind, pulls the

00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:36.920
suspect out from the van, and knocks him down
dead on the ground.

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:41.269
The emergency response team, together with
Tina, arrives and secures the crime scene.

00:11:41.269 --> 00:11:44.300
As Tina checks on the crime scene, she suddenly
feels restless.

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:47.420
Agneta notices her anxiety and asks if she’s
found something.

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:50.769
Tina denies her lead and continues to walk
further into the woods.

00:11:50.769 --> 00:11:52.709
Deep in the woods, she finds Vore.

00:11:52.709 --> 00:11:55.630
He then admits that he is with the suspect
and tells Tina that he needed to do it in

00:11:55.630 --> 00:11:57.779
order to stop the suspect from talking.

00:11:57.779 --> 00:12:01.550
As Tina reacts violently, Vore tries to hold
her tight as he explains that he is only doing

00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:03.360
it to inflict pain on humans.

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:06.860
Tina confronts him about her discovery of
a baby that he kept inside the fridge.

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:10.079
Vore smiles and explains that it is neither
a baby nor a human; but a “Hiisit” or

00:12:10.079 --> 00:12:14.040
a ‘changeling’, a human-like creature
used as a substitute when trolls abduct human

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:15.040
babies.

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:18.270
He further explains that he occasionally gives
birth to a changeling and confesses that he

00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:21.290
uses it in exchange for every human baby he
abducts.

00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:24.399
Just as humans take away from them, he takes
in return from humans.

00:12:24.399 --> 00:12:27.019
Tina then asks about the human babies that
he took.

00:12:27.019 --> 00:12:29.230
He deliberately replies that he sells them.

00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:33.500
Disgusted by Vore’s revelations, Tina displays
her dominance and resentment towards him.

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:37.150
As Vore is about to show his submission, Tina
suddenly turns his back and walks out, leaving

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:38.150
Vore behind.&nbsp;

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:40.620
&nbsp;
The next day, Tina catches sight of an ambulance

00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:42.690
parking in front of her neighbor’s house.

00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:45.389
She quickly goes inside to check on her neighbor’s
situation.

00:12:45.389 --> 00:12:48.610
Later, she discovers that Vore replaced their
baby with a changeling.

00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:52.279
She immediately rushes to Vore’s cabin and
finds out that Vore has already left.

00:12:52.279 --> 00:12:55.360
As Tina looks for some scent to track him,
she finds a note instead that says to meet

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:56.570
him on the ferry.

00:12:56.570 --> 00:12:59.490
Later that night, Tina goes to the ferry to
meet up with Vore.

00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:01.610
Vore is surprisingly happy to see her.

00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:05.339
As he notices Tina’s despair on her face,
the police are already surrounding him, ready

00:13:05.339 --> 00:13:06.529
to take him in.

00:13:06.529 --> 00:13:10.450
Vore bids his last farewell to Tina just as
the police restrains and arrests him.

00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:14.310
As the police move him in, Vore suddenly struggles
and jumps overboard, disappearing into the

00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:15.350
water.

00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:17.580
&nbsp;
Back at her house, Tina’s dad visits her.

00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:20.139
He confesses how her parents were once a part
of an experiment.

00:13:20.139 --> 00:13:24.500
And he, as a caretaker of the science facility,
was asked by her troll parents to take care

00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:27.550
of her young self before the scientists discover
her existence.

00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:30.529
Because of his wife’s desire to have a child
of their own, they wholeheartedly took Tina

00:13:30.529 --> 00:13:32.080
in as their daughter.

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:35.759
Sensing her dad’s sincerity, Tina asks how
her original parents named her.

00:13:35.759 --> 00:13:37.500
Her dad replies “Reva.”

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:40.279
&nbsp;
Months later, Tina, now known as Reva, continues

00:13:40.279 --> 00:13:42.319
her life as a troll in the forest.

00:13:42.319 --> 00:13:45.940
Then one day, she goes back to her abandoned
house where she sees a large box wrapped in

00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:47.950
paper that was left in the front door.

00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:50.110
She drags the box inside and opens it.

00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:52.000
Inside the box is a troll infant.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.190
She goes to the box to find some scent prints
that she can identify but instead finds a

00:13:55.190 --> 00:13:57.180
musical postcard of Finland.

00:13:57.180 --> 00:14:00.389
Looking at the postcard, she knows that it
is both Vore’s and her child.

00:14:00.389 --> 00:14:03.900
As she takes her baby outside, she shows a
determined face to raise her child as her

00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:04.900
own.

00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:08.019
She feeds him with an insect crawling out
from decomposing lumber.

00:14:08.019 --> 00:14:09.180
&nbsp;
Caught between the 'Border' between being

00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:12.930
a human and a troll, Tina chooses a life of
a troll in the end as she raises her child

00:14:12.930 --> 00:14:20.319
in the wilderness — free from the harm of
the discriminating humans.
