00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:03.470
Hi, Mystery Recapped here.

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:09.179
Today I’m going to explain a Japanese drama
film called “Survival Family,” Spoilers

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:10.179
ahead!

00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:16.200
Watch out and take care!

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.620
The Suzuki family is a family of four living
in the suburban part of Tokyo.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:23.660
At the beginning of the movie, we see them
in their small apartment.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:29.890
The father, Yoshiyuki Suzuki is enjoying watching
the television while his son, Kenji, and daughter

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:31.780
Yui are on their phones.

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:35.800
We see that the family is wholly dependent
on technology to keep themselves entertained

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:42.190
and hardly ever spend time with each other.

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.499
The following morning, Yoshiyuki wakes up
late and sees that his alarm clock isn’t

00:00:46.499 --> 00:00:47.499
working.

00:00:47.499 --> 00:00:51.920
He rushes outside and asks his wife Mitsue
what time it is, only to find out none of

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.149
the clocks work.

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:57.109
Mitsue also tells him everything that runs
on electricity has stopped working because

00:00:57.109 --> 00:00:58.519
of a power outage.

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:02.629
Yui wakes up and freaks out to see the AC
and the TV aren’t working either.

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:06.500
Yoshiyuki tries to call the electricity company,
but even the phone is down too.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.990
The father and the children quickly get dressed
and head outside for work and school.

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.820
They see a crowd at the elevator waiting for
it to arrive but soon find out that the power

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.299
outage has halted the elevator as well.

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:21.810
Everyone from the floor walks downstairs,
confused at the strange and sudden outage.

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.170
Yoshiyuki is already late, so he rushes to
the train station but comes across a crowd

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:27.170
again.

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.460
It turns out the outage has halted the trains,
so they won’t be able to travel through

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.229
it until further notice.

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:37.100
People try taking a bus as an alternative,
but all electrically and fueled-powered systems

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.100
are down.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.270
At the same time, we see Kenji going to school
on his bicycle.

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.219
The usually bustling city has no running vehicles.

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:48.259
A confused Kenji cycles further to see everyone
walking to work.

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:51.590
Two grown-ups even eye his bicycle, jealous
of the kid.

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.060
When Yoshiyuki finally reaches his office,
it turns out the automated front doors are

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.060
shut.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.310
It is even weirder that none of their watches
are working, so they do not know what time

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:01.310
it is.

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.340
After contemplating for a while, two of his
colleagues break the glass door and go inside

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.340
to work.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.789
But disappointment soon washes over them when
they realize the computers in the office have

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:13.180
run out of power as well.

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:19.360
Meanwhile, Mitsue meets her friends outside
the apartment and discusses the power outage.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.190
Her friends rush to the store to get some
candles for the night.

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.370
Mitsue is confused because she believes the
power will be back by night but follows her

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:27.470
friends anyway.

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.110
At the grocery store, people stock up on food,
water, and supplies.

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.920
Mitsue does the same and waits in a long line
to pay for the stuff.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.100
Since the machines are not working, the cashier
announces they will only take cash.

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.840
This way, some people get off the line to
bring money out from the ATM, only to see

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.550
that ATMs do not work either.

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.580
At Yoshiyuki’s office, people realize that
this isn’t just a normal power outage, but

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.500
they are not sure what exactly is wrong.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.459
Their boss dismisses them for the day since
they cannot work without computers.

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:58.400
While returning home, Yoshiyuki goes to a
bicycle shop.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:05.849
The prices of bicycles are high because of
the outage but Yoshiyuki buys one nonetheless.

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:09.760
At night, the Suzuki family lights candles
around the house and eats their dinner in

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:10.760
peace.

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.989
Kenji goes to the washroom only to find that
the toilet doesn’t flush; at the same time,

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:16.819
the taps stop working too.

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:21.370
Yui is confused because the electricity outage
shouldn’t cause taps to malfunction.

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.439
After dinner, the children go back to their
room like usual, but they soon get bored without

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:27.440
their phones and the internet.

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.209
The whole family then gathers at the balcony
and gazes at the sky.

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:34.150
The dark city enhances the light coming from
the stars.

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:40.620
The family enjoys quality time together after
ages.

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.550
It is now the third day after the power outage;
the family’s apartment is in bad shape.

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:49.650
Dirty plates pile up in the sink because of
water scarcity, and dirty laundry hangs around

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:50.819
the apartment.

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:54.730
Without electricity, the lifestyle of the
people has changed drastically in just three

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:55.730
days.

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.829
At Yoshiyuki’s office that day, his senior
asks everyone to stop coming to work till

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:01.290
the power comes back.

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.170
Yoshiyuki retaliates, saying if they don’t
work, they won’t earn money, but his senior

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.710
asks him to take care of his family instead.

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:11.959
He claims that living in a city like Tokyo
will be extremely difficult during such conditions

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:14.700
because they will soon run out of food and
water.

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.140
Outside the office, Yoshiyuki sees his senior
with his family leaving for the countryside.

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:23.410
Yoshiyuki contemplates doing the same but
still has hope everything will go back to

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:24.410
normal.

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:29.180
Later we see Mitsue go to a nearby water tank
to get water, but she, along with the crowd,

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.440
is sent back because even the tank runs out
of drinking water.

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:37.190
Meanwhile, Yoshiyuki goes to the bank to withdraw
some money but returns after being shoved

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:38.690
around by the crowd.

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:41.350
It is now the seventh day of the power outage.

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:45.800
All grocery stores have been wiped out of
food and supplies, offices and schools have

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.610
closed, and the power outage has caused all
factories to shut down.

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:54.580
More and more people are moving to the countryside,
and the Suzuki family decides to do the same.

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.020
The following day, they pack up their bags
and leave early in the morning on their bicycles.

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.600
The children ride their own while Yoshiyuki
keeps Mitsue on the back of his bicycle.

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:07.150
They have to buy drinking water midway, but
all the shops overprice it.

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:11.120
Mitsue bargains and manages to get some at
a relatively low price.

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:15.410
They stop at a place to rest and eat for the
day and immediately set off after getting

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:16.410
done.

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:19.210
Finally, they reach the airport from where
they plan to take the flight to Mitsue’s

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:22.000
village Kagoshima where her father lives.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.800
They were told that flights were still working,
but disappointment washes over them when they

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.009
see a crowd outside the airport complaining
to the officials.

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:32.960
It turns out that the flights have been recently
canceled and won’t restart until the power

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.139
comes back.

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:37.780
With nowhere to go, the family ends up in
a hotel nearby.

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:42.060
The owner of the hotel takes advantage of
their situation and charges them outrageous

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:43.060
prices.

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:44.650
But the family doesn’t complain.

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:49.190
At night Yui suggests they go back home, but
according to Yoshiyuki, there is no food or

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:53.870
water left in Tokyo, so it is impossible to
survive there.

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:56.830
They will have to make it to Kagoshima on
bicycles.

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:01.660
The following day, Kenji and Yui go to a bookstore
and get a map to navigate the locations.

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:06.100
Meanwhile, the parents barter two bottles
of Yoshiyuki’s alcohol for a bicycle and

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:07.100
some food.

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:09.190
Then the family continues their journey.

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:13.230
After a few hours, they finally reach a highway
where several travelers like them are traveling

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:14.600
to the countryside.

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:18.190
At night they stop at a camp and decide to
stay there with fellow travelers.

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:22.470
A couple sees them drinking water and asks
for some, but the family lies about it being

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:23.470
the last bottle.

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:26.010
They eat the food and fall asleep.

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:30.070
On the next day, they continue the journey
and end up in a dark tunnel filled with corpses.

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:32.790
They are helped by old ladies to cross it.

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:36.169
It is now sixteen days after the power outage.

00:06:36.169 --> 00:06:39.660
The family is by a river when their last bottle
of water runs out.

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:43.680
With no other way, Yoshiyuki drinks the water
from the river directly.

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:47.410
After they leave the riverside, a massive
storm hits, making the family abandon their

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:51.349
bicycles and belongings and take shelter in
a nearby area.

00:06:51.349 --> 00:06:56.009
After the storm, they go back to their bikes
to see one of their tires had been destroyed.

00:06:56.009 --> 00:06:59.320
Moreover, all their clothes and food supplies
are ruined as well.

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:04.090
Soon, they reach a nearby town, and the kids
go searching for food and water, leaving Yoshiyuki

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:05.639
and Mitsue behind to rest.

00:07:05.639 --> 00:07:10.710
They are excited to find a grocery store but
see everything from the food section is gone.

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:14.360
Kenji searches for a bicycle tire, but they
are sold out as well.

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:19.310
He then finds battery water which is just
distilled water and can be used to drink.

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:22.100
Yui gets cat food and brings them back to
their parents.

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:25.840
She tries the cat food for the first time
and finds it disgusting, but the family has

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:27.740
to compromise to survive.

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:32.319
Kenji fixes the tire using his phone’s cover,
and they continue their journey again.

00:07:32.319 --> 00:07:36.370
They survive on battery water and cat food
for a week before meeting a group of campers

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:37.919
on the twenty-second day.

00:07:37.919 --> 00:07:40.770
The campers teach them about edible roadside
weeds.

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:44.650
One of them takes a picture of the family
from a non-digital camera and promises to

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:46.580
send it to them when the power comes back.

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:50.220
They travel together for a few hours then
go their separate ways.

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:54.289
On day forty-three, they arrive in front of
an aquarium where the people catch fish and

00:07:54.289 --> 00:07:55.289
eat them.

00:07:55.289 --> 00:07:58.990
The family happily gets into the line as they
have limited food left now.

00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:01.539
But by their turn, everything is sold.

00:08:01.539 --> 00:08:06.460
Yoshiyuki begs the man selling the fish to
give some to the kids, only to be ignored.

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:10.220
A disappointed family moves along with the
journey but soon gets tired because of the

00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:11.789
lack of food and water.

00:08:11.789 --> 00:08:15.919
One day, they end up in a field where Yoshiyuki
is about to eat an insect.

00:08:15.919 --> 00:08:17.880
Just then, they see a pig nearby.

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:22.199
The family is overjoyed when Yoshiyuki manages
to catch the pig but they are reluctant to

00:08:22.199 --> 00:08:24.300
cut it, even while starving.

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:27.910
Just then, a man approaches them and slices
the pig himself.

00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:32.300
He introduces himself as Tanaka and asks the
family to help him get the pig to his farm.

00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:34.710
At his home, he treats the family with a meal.

00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:38.520
They devour it completely, having starved
the past few days.

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:42.390
For the next week, they stay with Tanaka but
then decide to continue their journey to the

00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:44.050
village again.

00:08:44.050 --> 00:08:46.330
Three days later, they end up by a river.

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:50.480
It turns out the map they were following was
old, so now, they have to cross the river

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:51.630
to get to their destination.

00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:56.620
They create a make-do raft with pieces of
wood and manage to get Mitsue and Yui to the

00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:57.620
other end.

00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:01.020
Then, Yoshiyuki and Kenji return to get the
bicycles.

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:06.050
However, just then, it starts to rain, and
the water flows faster, taking Yoshiyuki with

00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:07.050
it.

00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:11.190
Kenji tries his best to save his father but
only finds his wig in the water.

00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:18.780
The family sits by the river crying, mourning
Yoshiyuki’s death.

00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:21.260
Sometime later, they continue their journey
on foot.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:25.130
The three make it to day ninety-four because
of the food they had stocked up at Tanaka.

00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:30.170
They are walking along a railway track when
suddenly, some dogs attack Mitsue, making

00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:31.550
her fall off the road.

00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:35.320
The kids run to save their mother, only to
see that her leg is broken.

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:39.030
They get her back on the track but are attacked
by the dogs again.

00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:41.360
Just then, the noise of a steam train is heard.

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:45.850
The family is beyond surprised when the train
stops in the tracks to pick them up.

00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:48.860
Since it runs on coal, the train is still
functional.

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:52.020
People inside dress Mitsue’s injuries and
help the family.

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:55.950
In the following scene, we see Yoshiyuki’s
body washed up by the river.

00:09:55.950 --> 00:09:59.880
Fortunately, he wakes up and manages to get
himself to a nearby truck.

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:02.720
Just then, the steam train his family is in
passes by.

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:06.130
Yoshiyuki uses a smoke torch to get the people’s
attention.

00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:10.050
Finally, the train stops, and the family reunites
happily.

00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:12.220
The train then takes him to their destination.

00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:15.950
They meet Mitsue’s father after years and
start living with him.

00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:21.590
In the following scene, we see two years and
126 days have passed after the power outage.

00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:25.410
The Suzuki family has been living in the beautiful
village of Kagoshima.

00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:28.880
They live a happy life fishing and weaving
their own clothes.

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:31.950
One day, Yoshiyuki wakes up to an alarm clock
ringing.

00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:35.740
Then, the whole village wakes up to the power
on coming back.

00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:38.790
Light bulbs start to work, and phones start
ringing.

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:42.780
Everyone is beyond surprised, but no one knows
for sure what brought the power back.

00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:50.170
A few weeks later, the family is back to their
old life in Tokyo.

00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:54.700
The news says that the two and a half year
long outage was because of a solar flare from

00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:55.700
the sun.

00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:59.550
Some believe it was a terrorist organization's
doing, but the reason is still not confirmed.

00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:03.830
The movie ends as the family receives a picture
that a stranger had taken of them while they

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:04.900
were traveling.

00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:09.490
The power outage taught people to appreciate
small things in life that they took for granted.

00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:13.610
Like the Suzuki family who didn’t care about
each other was brought closer than ever because

00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:20.110
of the hardship they had to face.
