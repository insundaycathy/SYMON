Hey everyone...

Welcome back to Movie Recap.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.960
Today i'm gonna show you a movie called,

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.000
Don't Breathe.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.560
It is a 2016 American horror&nbsp;thriller film

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.040
produced and directed by Federico Alvarez,

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.080
co-produced by Sam Raimi and starring Jane&nbsp;Levy,

Stephen Lang and Dylan Minnette.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.880
The movie is about a young&nbsp;woman and her friends involved

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.000
in&nbsp;a house robbery owned by&nbsp;an ex-military blind man,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.640
unfortunately must find a way to escape his&nbsp;home

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.480
before they become his victims.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:29.840
Let's start...

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.095
Three Detroit friends, Rocky , Alex , and Money

00:00:43.095 --> 00:00:45.072
break into the home of wealthy owners.

00:00:45.072 --> 00:00:47.776
After Alex disables the security&nbsp;system,

00:00:47.776 --> 00:00:51.427
they begin to grab the nicest-looking items&nbsp;they can get their hands on.

00:00:51.427 --> 00:00:55.232
When they're done, they throw a rock&nbsp;through the plate glass door and run.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.456
Rocky lives with her little sister Diddy

00:00:58.456 --> 00:01:01.572
and their abusive mother Ginger and her boyfriend Trevor.

00:01:01.572 --> 00:01:04.473
Rocky promises to Diddy that&nbsp;she will get both of them out

00:01:04.473 --> 00:01:07.518
of there so they can start&nbsp;a new life in California.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.597
Alex lives with his father, an active policeman,&nbsp;who is never home

00:01:12.597 --> 00:01:16.323
and is apparently pulling&nbsp;double shifts at the local police station.

00:01:16.323 --> 00:01:18.822
Alex uses his father's computer connections

00:01:18.822 --> 00:01:20.570
to look for wealthy people to rob.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.990
Money gets a tip from one of his connects about&nbsp;a man living in a house

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.514
with more than $300,000 in cash stashed somewhere.

00:01:29.514 --> 00:01:33.313
It's been said&nbsp;that the man is a war veteran and that he lives alone

00:01:33.313 --> 00:01:35.812
after his daughter was killed in a&nbsp;car accident.

00:01:35.812 --> 00:01:38.486
Rocky is on board since this could be the last robbery

00:01:38.486 --> 00:01:42.177
they ever have to pull&nbsp;off, but Alex doesn't agree with the plan.

00:01:42.177 --> 00:01:44.446
He later relents when Rocky begs him,

00:01:44.446 --> 00:01:47.392
as he has&nbsp;a crush on her, even though she's with Money.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.040
The three stalk the man's house, which is located in a slum neighborhood

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.466
and is the only occupied house on the&nbsp;street

00:01:55.466 --> 00:01:58.876
since every other house is condemned and learn that he is blind.

00:01:58.876 --> 00:02:01.663
Alex thinks&nbsp;it's messed up to rob a blind guy,

00:02:01.663 --> 00:02:04.671
but Money says it doesn't mean&nbsp;he's a saint if he's blind.

00:02:04.671 --> 00:02:07.715
Alex spots a tattoo on Rocky's wrist&nbsp;that's new,

00:02:07.715 --> 00:02:09.064
which is of a ladybug.

00:02:09.064 --> 00:02:10.831
She explains that as a child,

00:02:10.831 --> 00:02:14.438
her father left&nbsp;her family and her mother blamed Rocky for it.

00:02:14.438 --> 00:02:16.964
She would cry and then get locked in the trunk.

00:02:16.964 --> 00:02:20.668
One time, a ladybug flew into the trunk and kept her company.

00:02:20.668 --> 00:02:23.153
She says she'll have it colored in&nbsp;California

00:02:23.153 --> 00:02:25.117
and then never mark her body again.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.995
The man's vicious Rottweiler dog then jumps

00:02:27.995 --> 00:02:30.683
on the car door and frightens the friends.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.935
That night, the three initiate the robbery.

00:02:35.935 --> 00:02:38.594
The friends head toward the man's house.

00:02:38.594 --> 00:02:41.308
Money drugs the dog to get him to knock out,

00:02:41.308 --> 00:02:43.569
allowing them a safe entry into the house.

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:46.432
Rocky goes in first through a small bathroom&nbsp;window

00:02:46.432 --> 00:02:48.606
and disables the security system.

00:02:48.606 --> 00:02:52.819
While her friends wait for her, Money taunts&nbsp;Alex for his crush on Rocky.

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:55.323
She returns and opens the back door.

00:02:55.323 --> 00:02:59.833
Money goes upstairs and&nbsp;finds the 'Blind Man' sleeping with the TV on.

00:02:59.833 --> 00:03:02.702
The Blind Man rises and hears a&nbsp;noise.

00:03:02.702 --> 00:03:06.197
He just turns the TV off and goes back to sleep.

00:03:06.197 --> 00:03:10.089
Money gasses the room&nbsp;to ensure that the man won't hear anything.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.461
The three find a locked door that leads to the&nbsp;basement.

00:03:15.461 --> 00:03:18.229
They think this is where they'll find the man's stash.

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:20.202
Money starts to break down&nbsp;the door,

00:03:20.202 --> 00:03:22.370
leading the Blind Man to wake up.

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.153
Money starts talking and says he doesn't want&nbsp;trouble,

00:03:28.153 --> 00:03:30.643
until he decides to pull a gun out on the man.

00:03:30.643 --> 00:03:32.967
The Blind Man takes a few steps&nbsp;forward

00:03:32.967 --> 00:03:34.878
as Money holds the gun in his face.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.701
As he slowly gets closer,

00:03:36.701 --> 00:03:38.830
the man grabs the&nbsp;gun from Money's hand

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:40.777
and pins him against the wall.

00:03:40.777 --> 00:03:44.414
The Blind Man asks Money how many of them&nbsp;there are in the house.

00:03:44.414 --> 00:03:48.457
Money says it's just him and he pleads for the man to let him go.

00:03:48.457 --> 00:03:50.479
The Blind&nbsp;Man loosens his grip,

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:53.391
but then shoots Money in the neck and through the head.

00:03:53.391 --> 00:03:57.386
He drops Money's&nbsp;body to the floor, and Rocky hides in the closet.

00:03:57.386 --> 00:04:00.331
The man enters and opens a safe containing his&nbsp;money.

00:04:00.331 --> 00:04:04.044
Rocky sees the code (2978) as he leaves.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.934
Alex goes to find Rocky after the Blind Man

00:04:07.934 --> 00:04:10.341
starts locking up all the doors and windows.

00:04:10.341 --> 00:04:13.238
They decide that they just have to sneak&nbsp;in through the basement

00:04:13.238 --> 00:04:15.853
and out the cellar door that leads outside.

00:04:15.853 --> 00:04:19.688
First, Rocky opens&nbsp;the safe and puts all the money in her bag.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:22.764
They head toward the basement,

00:04:22.764 --> 00:04:24.411
but the man emerges from there.

00:04:24.411 --> 00:04:27.030
The two keep quiet as he holds Money's gun.

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:30.476
Someone's phone goes off, and he fires a quick shot.

00:04:30.476 --> 00:04:32.496
Rocky and Alex then head downstairs

00:04:32.496 --> 00:04:35.049
as the man drags Money's body outside.

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.823
In the basement, Rocky is startled by a woman

00:04:38.823 --> 00:04:40.562
who's been chained up to the wall.

00:04:40.562 --> 00:04:42.418
Rocky and Alex are freaked out

00:04:42.418 --> 00:04:45.973
and&nbsp;almost leave her until the woman holds up a newspaper article.

00:04:45.973 --> 00:04:47.934
It reveals that her name is&nbsp;Cindy,

00:04:47.934 --> 00:04:51.387
and that she's the woman who accidentally killed the Blind Man's daughter,

00:04:51.387 --> 00:04:52.525
but she was&nbsp;acquitted.

00:04:52.525 --> 00:04:56.187
Rocky and Alex free her and carry her toward the cellar door.

00:04:56.187 --> 00:04:59.369
Unfortunately,&nbsp;the Blind Man is there when they open it.

00:04:59.369 --> 00:05:03.000
He fires the gun and strikes&nbsp;Cindy in the face, killing her.

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.603
Rocky and Alex hide, and the man finds out he shot&nbsp;Cindy.

00:05:08.603 --> 00:05:11.095
He cries over her body and yells in rage.

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.625
Alex picks up the man's keys

00:05:14.625 --> 00:05:17.845
and decides to&nbsp;try and make it back to the front door.

00:05:17.845 --> 00:05:20.019
As he and Rocky head back upstairs,

00:05:20.019 --> 00:05:22.684
the Blind Man turns&nbsp;off the lights in the basement,

00:05:22.684 --> 00:05:24.541
leaving them all in total darkness.

00:05:24.541 --> 00:05:28.200
Rocky and Alex feel around for&nbsp;each other as the man shoots the gun.

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:32.066
Rocky almost touches the Blind Man until Alex calls her name.

00:05:32.066 --> 00:05:36.278
The Blind Man catches Alex and tries to shoot, but his gun is empty.

00:05:36.278 --> 00:05:39.279
Alex pushes a shelf down&nbsp;on him, trapping him.

00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:41.197
He and Rocky run upstairs.

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.678
Alex holds the door closed with a crowbar.

00:05:46.678 --> 00:05:48.991
He and Rocky try to open the door,

00:05:48.991 --> 00:05:52.590
only to find the dog has woken up and&nbsp;is ready to attack them.

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:55.356
They run from the dog and trap it in a room.

00:05:55.356 --> 00:05:56.433
Unfortunately,

00:05:56.433 --> 00:05:58.843
the Blind Man has gotten out of the basement

00:05:58.843 --> 00:06:00.244
and he attacks Alex.

00:06:00.244 --> 00:06:02.638
He punches&nbsp;him multiple times in the face

00:06:02.638 --> 00:06:05.229
and appears to impale him with garden shears.

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:08.101
He then finds Rocky and knocks her out too.

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:12.700
Rocky wakes up in the basement,

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:14.615
chained in the same spot as Cindy.

00:06:14.615 --> 00:06:17.931
She tells the Blind Man that this won't bring his&nbsp;daughter back.

00:06:17.931 --> 00:06:20.306
He says that's not entirely true.

00:06:20.306 --> 00:06:23.979
He impregnated Cindy to give him a child to make&nbsp;up for the one she killed,

00:06:23.979 --> 00:06:26.640
and he would have let her go once she gave birth.

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:29.810
With Cindy dead, his&nbsp;unborn child has died as well,

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:31.712
and he holds Rocky accountable.

00:06:31.712 --> 00:06:33.763
He cuts open a hole in Rocky's pants

00:06:33.763 --> 00:06:36.733
and grabs a baster filled with his semen sample.

00:06:36.733 --> 00:06:39.451
He prepares to impregnate Rocky, but luckily,

00:06:39.451 --> 00:06:41.875
Alex has gotten up and grabbed a hammer.

00:06:41.875 --> 00:06:45.032
He whacks the Blind Man over the head and frees&nbsp;Rocky.

00:06:45.032 --> 00:06:46.911
They handcuff the man to a pole.

00:06:46.911 --> 00:06:51.045
She starts kicking the man and then stuffs the baster down&nbsp;his throat.

00:06:51.045 --> 00:06:54.112
They leave him alone and decide not to involve the cops

00:06:54.112 --> 00:06:57.929
since the man could easily&nbsp;tell the cops that Rocky and Alex broke in.

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.807
The two head back upstairs to leave.

00:07:01.807 --> 00:07:04.036
They manage to open the front door,

00:07:04.036 --> 00:07:07.581
but the Blind Man has gotten&nbsp;up and he shoots Alex dead.

00:07:07.581 --> 00:07:11.181
Rocky makes a run for it, just as the man lets&nbsp;the dog out.

00:07:11.181 --> 00:07:13.143
Rocky runs back to Money's car

00:07:13.143 --> 00:07:15.606
and tries to make it in before the dog gets her,

00:07:15.606 --> 00:07:18.100
but she dropped her bag outside the car.

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:22.511
Rocky opens the trunk to try and trap the dog in&nbsp;there so she can get out.

00:07:22.511 --> 00:07:25.807
Her plan works, and she goes outside to get the money,

00:07:25.807 --> 00:07:29.329
but the&nbsp;Blind Man comes out and knocks Rocky out again.

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:34.692
The Blind Man drags Rocky back to his house to&nbsp;finish his job.

00:07:34.692 --> 00:07:37.204
A ladybug flies onto Rocky's hand,

00:07:37.204 --> 00:07:39.535
giving her a boost of confidence and hope.

00:07:39.535 --> 00:07:43.058
Rocky&nbsp;grabs the control to set off the security system,

00:07:43.058 --> 00:07:45.342
causing the alarm to distract the man.

00:07:45.342 --> 00:07:47.623
She grabs&nbsp;the crowbar and whacks the Blind Man

00:07:47.623 --> 00:07:50.850
over the head multiple times until he falls into the basement

00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:53.954
and has his gun go off, shooting him in the side.

00:07:53.954 --> 00:07:57.840
Rocky takes the money and leaves&nbsp;the house before the police show up.

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:01.012
On the last scene of the movie,

00:08:01.012 --> 00:08:03.821
Rocky is now with&nbsp;Diddy at the Detroit airport,

00:08:03.821 --> 00:08:05.437
ready to start their new lives.

00:08:05.437 --> 00:08:08.327
Rocky then sees a news report on&nbsp;TV,

00:08:08.327 --> 00:08:10.606
stating that the Blind Man was found alive

00:08:10.606 --> 00:08:14.111
and that only two burglars were reported as&nbsp;breaking into his home,

00:08:14.111 --> 00:08:15.747
and that he killed both of them.

00:08:15.747 --> 00:08:18.752
Rocky becomes nervous and then&nbsp;takes Diddy with her,

00:08:18.752 --> 00:08:20.466
never to look back again.

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:24.193
Thanks for watching...
