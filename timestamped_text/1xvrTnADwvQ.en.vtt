00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:57.759 align:start position:0%
you look at the chess piece itself
 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:01:59.910 align:start position:0%
you look at the chess piece itself
there's<00:01:58.079><c> clearly</c><00:01:58.560><c> a</c><00:01:58.719><c> big</c><00:01:59.040><c> gap</c><00:01:59.360><c> running</c><00:01:59.680><c> down</c>

clip it together and then throw it which

clip it together and then throw it which
