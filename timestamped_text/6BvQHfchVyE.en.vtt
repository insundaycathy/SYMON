00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:06.080

hbo max throughout this video we're going to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:17.200
breaking down the ins and outs of the story it's&nbsp;
ending and discussing the super secret surprise&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:22.400
villain that was shown in every trailer for the&nbsp;
film obviously there will be heavy spoilers here&nbsp;&nbsp;

this each and every day okay so there's a lot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.400
to unpack from this movie and i will be doing&nbsp;
a slight recap to discuss the major plot points&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.880
as i feel you need to know them in order for the&nbsp;
ending to make sense however if you just want to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:50.240
skip ahead then time codes will be linked below&nbsp;
the film itself centers heavily around the hollow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:55.360
earth this is a real life theory that first&nbsp;
hit the mainstream back in the 17th century&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:00.000
after edmund haley theorized that earth had&nbsp;
an almost onion-like structure with several&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.520
layers to it though never proven the theory&nbsp;
still remains popular in conspiracy circles&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:09.840
and is something that makes the basis for this&nbsp;
movie in the titles for the film we discover&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.520
that there was an expedition to antarctica&nbsp;
in 1926 that unearthed its existence after&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.400
the people who participated in it disappeared the&nbsp;
event was quickly declassified by the government&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.520
but they've kept a close eye on it as there exists&nbsp;
a powerful energy source within its cavernous&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:31.120
tunnels it's the arise throughout the film that&nbsp;
this upon us will be able to destroy godzilla&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:35.360
and it sort of becomes the mcguffin for the&nbsp;
boring human subplot that gets in the way of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.640
the two titans of terror tearing each other in&nbsp;
from them which let them fight yeah that's all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.840
i want to say now the movie picks up five years&nbsp;
after the events of godzilla king of the monsters&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.360
and we join kong who's currently living in a&nbsp;
simulated skull island at monarch outpost 236&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.160
after the skull island mission that took place in&nbsp;
the 70s made his existence government knowledge&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:02.640
he's been placed in the production of man and&nbsp;
woman overseen by eileen andrews and her adopted&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.080
daughter gia who can communicate with him through&nbsp;
sign language sorry guerrilla sign language&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.120
he's lived somewhat of a peaceful existence&nbsp;
until he starts chucking trees about this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.160
something that we saw him doing in a solo movie&nbsp;
when the helicopters first arrived at skull island&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.000
and it's it's a pretty crappy strike that i&nbsp;
i don't even know why i bothered including&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.600
however linking back to school island we learned&nbsp;
that gia is actually the last of the iwa aka the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.480
tribe that we met in that movie who lived somewhat&nbsp;
of a symbiotic existence with the creature&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.200
now because he's an alpha titan the organization&nbsp;
know that this puts him in direct competition with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.320
godzilla and thus they've kept him shielded from&nbsp;
the monster in the build up to the film a lot of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.480
people wondered how kong would end up going&nbsp;
toe-to-toe with the monster due to the site's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:52.480
difference many of them my wife included often&nbsp;
say that size doesn't matter but there was some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.840
people scratching their heads over how he would be&nbsp;
a formidable opponent however we do learn in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:03.040
movie that kong has continued to grow and that&nbsp;
the dome is becoming too small to stabilize him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:09.200
now in these five years the shadowy organization&nbsp;
apex cybernetics have managed to build a gigantic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.160
robotic titan known as mechagodzilla using the&nbsp;
head of the ghidorah that we saw at the end of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:19.920
king of the monsters ishiro sarah zawa's son ren&nbsp;
has helped to perfect this titan killing machine&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:25.200
and he's able to telepathically control it through&nbsp;
neural link-ups designed by apex in the build-up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.600
to the film it was said in the leaks that there&nbsp;
were a lot of similarities with pacific rim&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:35.520
and i feel like these moments especially ape&nbsp;
that film but not intended well well it was a bit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:40.720
intended now the experiments are highly secretive&nbsp;
but bernie hayes the host of the titan conspiracy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:46.240
theory podcast has managed to infiltrate their&nbsp;
organization through posing as an employee&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.720
haze unearthed some of their dodgy dealings but&nbsp;
before he can really get anywhere beyond seeing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:56.720
eye to eye with mecha g godzilla shows up to&nbsp;
eat some fish and ships turns out you either die&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.120
king of the monsters or live long enough to see&nbsp;
yourself become a villain and the titan has now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:06.400
become the latest victim of cancel culture due to&nbsp;
his constant attacks on their facilities madison&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.760
russell however realizes that there's stranger&nbsp;
things going on hey and she heads out with her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.960
friend rusty from deadpool 2 to get to the bottom&nbsp;
of it realizing that their operations are going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:23.120
down worse in an amberhead tweet apex enlists the&nbsp;
help of nathan lind nathan is a hollywood theorist&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:28.000
at dresses like marty mcfly and he also helps&nbsp;
out because he used to work for monok believing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.600
that genetic memory exists within all creatures&nbsp;
lin theorizes that all beings wish to return to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.480
their evolutionary source and thus they team up&nbsp;
with monarch and kong to lead them on a journey to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:43.680
the center of the hollow earth now kong is taken&nbsp;
across the ocean and on the way we can see that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.800
the character is sedated by giant green canisters&nbsp;
which is strapped on a collar around his neck&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:54.000
this is actually a callback to the original versus&nbsp;
film between the pair in which the humans used a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.720
similar sort of liquid in order to sedate him now&nbsp;
it's on this voyage that godzilla arrives for the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:05.040
showdown at sea that sees him not only beating&nbsp;
kong but also most of the monarch and apex vessels&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:10.400
the first battle doesn't disappoint and you can&nbsp;
see why they put so much hype into this fight as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:16.400
it's an awesome action scene that feels fit for&nbsp;
a king kong up until this point i feel like it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:21.360
was the best scene in the monster base and by far&nbsp;
was with the weights and delays that have seen his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:27.520
film push back several times when discussing the&nbsp;
scene with ign director adam wingard talked about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:32.080
how he wanted to pay homage to jaws in several&nbsp;
ways and we see this not only with godzilla's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.960
dorsal fin soaring through the water but also the&nbsp;
boat that he pulls under with him shot similar to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:42.160
the barrel scene it forces the humans into freeing&nbsp;
kong so that he can not only protect himself&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:48.240
but also them the battle goes underwater and&nbsp;
godzilla clearly beats kong making my boy take his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:54.080
first l in a long line of them however the humans&nbsp;
disable the engines on their ships so that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:59.360
g-man thinks that they're destroyed and godzilla&nbsp;
retreats realizing that he'll come back as soon&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:04.800
as they start them up again the humans carry kong&nbsp;
across the sky and what is a reference to the hot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:10.960
air balloon moment that appeared in 1962's king&nbsp;
kong versus godzilla along with kong monarch enter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:16.160
the hollow earth and find an almost prehistoric&nbsp;
landscape that's similar to skull island&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:21.040
due to the ceiling and ground both being part&nbsp;
of the earth there are severe gravitational&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:26.480
anomalies and the hollow earth is protected with&nbsp;
natural forces similar to kong's home elsewhere&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:32.400
madison her buddy josh and bernie managed to seek&nbsp;
into the apex facility because their security is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:37.760
absolutely terrible it's worse than my best&nbsp;
mate riddled richard's antivirus protection&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:43.600
and i don't mean on his computer i said hey you&nbsp;
haven't having that now here they discover apex&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:49.040
running combat simulations against skull crawlers&nbsp;
their continued testing alerts godzilla once more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:54.000
and he travels to hong kong to attempt to destroy&nbsp;
the manufactured titan in the hollow earth we're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:00.000
introduced to new monsters including nuzuki and&nbsp;
also warbat the former is a giant winged snake&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.120
that we see too of getting their butts handed&nbsp;
to them after our boy does some kung fu the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:11.120
latter or large bat like creatures that attack him&nbsp;
inside the giant tomb that's there for his species&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:16.000
this showcases some of the skeletons left behind&nbsp;
in the war between the gajira and kong over the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.800
millennia and also teases that their great&nbsp;
rivalry now this used to be the kong's home&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:26.320
but since they died out it's become somewhat of&nbsp;
a shrine along with the history lesson kong also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:32.000
gains an axe the blade of which is made from a&nbsp;
gajira dorsal fin capable of being charged by the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.920
energy source the activation of this is sensed by&nbsp;
godzilla who blasts his way through from hong kong&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:42.960
into the hollow earth chamber kong travels through&nbsp;
the crater and in the city they fight it out which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:49.200
leads to another amazing action scene it's like a&nbsp;
live action rampage fight and it overall elevates&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:54.400
the movie to be the best in the monster vs saga so&nbsp;
far i definitely feel like they brought everything&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:58.720
out that they could to make it so that the fights&nbsp;
felt impactful throughout and other human parts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:04.480
slightly bogged down the overall story these bits&nbsp;
really shine what doesn't shine though is my boy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:11.680
kong who takes another solid l and with godzilla&nbsp;
weakened apex's ceo walter simmons uses the hollow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:16.800
earth's power to fully charge mechagodzilla&nbsp;
however this backfires and ren is killed due to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:21.760
the overcharge which allows the consciousness of&nbsp;
ghidorah to take over the machine and it murders&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:26.720
walter during his bad guy monologue before it&nbsp;
ventures to the surface to avenge its death&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:33.040
the humans manage to revive kong and jia convinces&nbsp;
him to join godzilla's side without a save mothra&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:38.160
joke in sight now the tagline of the film is one&nbsp;
will fall and i do feel like this was slightly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:43.520
misleading as i was half expecting a death but&nbsp;
obviously these monsters crush it at the box&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:48.560
office so warner brothers don't want to destroy&nbsp;
what is quickly becoming their tentpole franchise&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:53.120
in the control room bernie josh and madison&nbsp;
help the short circuit mechagodzilla&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:58.000
and godzilla powers up kong's axe which&nbsp;
he uses to destroy the mechanical monster&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.480
with just godzilla and kong left standing&nbsp;
it looks like the two are going to face down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:07.760
against one another but the pair have somewhat&nbsp;
found a respect that their ancestors could not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:12.160
and they go their separate ways to form&nbsp;
their own kingdoms in their respective realms&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:16.560
now this takes us to the hollow earth which&nbsp;
has now become a kong monitoring station&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:22.480
nathan is now likely singing come on eileen as&nbsp;
he her and jia work together to turn the habitat&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:27.600
into his new home something that the monster was&nbsp;
searching for the entire film because skull island&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:33.600
was devastated by storms that wiped out the ewe he&nbsp;
had been left without one but this ancestral plane&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:38.800
allows him to finally have a domain once more to&nbsp;
rule over the monster verse has been very strict&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:44.240
over not calling him king kong but now at this&nbsp;
point i feel like this is cemented according to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:49.120
the original plot leaks on the film which pretty&nbsp;
much got this entire story bang on that showing of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:53.520
the movie revealed that kong was going to be the&nbsp;
king of the hollow earth whilst godzilla would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:58.320
remain king of the monsters these separate domains&nbsp;
allowed them to be the alphas of their respective&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:03.680
kingdoms without upsetting the natural order of&nbsp;
events though we can't verify exactly what was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:09.680
shown at the screening due to nda's this does make&nbsp;
a lot of sense and also opens the doors to sequels&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:14.640
that center around them and their respective&nbsp;
kingdoms now adam wingard has done several&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:18.800
interviews since the movie released overseas&nbsp;
and he explained that the film doesn't have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:23.760
a post-credits scene because he didn't want to&nbsp;
pigeonhole himself into going down a certain path&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:28.480
though we now know that the movie was extremely&nbsp;
successful in its opening weekend they obviously&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:33.040
didn't know how big it would be when making it&nbsp;
and thus didn't want to restrict themselves to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:38.400
one story avenue going forward i think this is&nbsp;
probably quite a smart thing to do as seeing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:42.800
charles stance at the end of king of the monsters&nbsp;
and being completely removed for this film makes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:47.680
little sense and it means that they can just&nbsp;
focus on that story as and when they get to it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:52.800
no doubt the pair will be back but it might be&nbsp;
some time before we see them on screen together&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:57.440
now as for my thoughts on the film i think&nbsp;
you already know what my criticisms will be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:02.480
as they're the thing that's always lobbied&nbsp;
against the movies in this saga the human&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:08.400
drama is pretty flat on the most part and there's&nbsp;
not even really any relationships this time around&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:13.520
so it's difficult to get attached to any of the&nbsp;
characters whereas in the prior monsterous movies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:20.480
there's either been a brother and sister a love&nbsp;
story or a family driving the storyline here the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:25.200
characters might as well just be put in place to&nbsp;
set up one plot point and take our characters to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:29.760
the next that's pretty much what they get to do&nbsp;
with kong and even people like millie bobby brown&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:34.960
who was a big part of the last movie get reduced&nbsp;
to having very little to do it's the same with her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:40.480
dad who even though he starred in peter jackson's&nbsp;
king kong doesn't really get anything to do at all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:45.520
he's pretty much just there to read text messages&nbsp;
and that's a shame because he was such a big part&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:49.520
i feel like he could have removed their entire&nbsp;
arcs out of the film and it would have been pretty&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:56.000
much the exact same movie with a lost however&nbsp;
saying that i just want to say congratulations&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:02.000
to the team for all the monster scenes and action&nbsp;
moments they really saved the film in my eyes and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:07.520
completely elevated it every time godzilla and&nbsp;
kong are on screen that is dynamite to the movie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:12.960
that makes it exhilarating to watch your heart's&nbsp;
bumping you're on the edge of your seat and these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:17.920
scenes are the best that we could have got there's&nbsp;
several bits where i was expecting martin scorsese&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:24.320
to pop on screen and say this is cinema because it&nbsp;
works so well so you know what we're talking about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:28.800
this i do feel bad digging in the movie for having&nbsp;
crap human subplots when that's not what we're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:34.000
here for what we really want to see is a showdown&nbsp;
between big monsters and this really delivers on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.200
the promise out of all the monster versus movies i&nbsp;
feel like this reigns at the top with godzilla in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:45.280
second place which i insist you go back and watch&nbsp;
after that for me it's probably skull island and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:50.880
lastly is king of the monsters because i just just&nbsp;
thought it was pretty meh i was kind of good at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:55.840
that kong took consecutive elves back to back as i&nbsp;
would have loved to have seen him get at least one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:55.840 --> 00:13:01.440
winning but i'm sure fans will debate all the time&nbsp;
like saying well he was sedated he was sedated&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:05.360
oh it is a shame that due to the pandemic&nbsp;
we can't all experience this in the cinema&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:10.240
as i think it would have been a blast to watch&nbsp;
but unfortunately that's just the way the world is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:15.840
that being said though godzilla versus kong was&nbsp;
a blast and it gets a 7 out of 10. obviously i'd&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:19.840
