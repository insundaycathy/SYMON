00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.050 align:start position:0%
that's just the logo though and yeah I
 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:21.780 align:start position:0%
that's just the logo though and yeah I
will<00:03:20.410><c> admit</c><00:03:20.770><c> we</c><00:03:20.950><c> could</c><00:03:21.160><c> be</c><00:03:21.280><c> completely</c>

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 align:start position:0%
will admit we could be completely

will admit we could be completely

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:23.710 align:start position:0%
reading into that so let's look at the
 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:26.280 align:start position:0%
reading into that so let's look at the
