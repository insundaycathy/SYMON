00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.120
Mystery Recapped here. Today, I'm going to&nbsp;
explain a german psychological thriller film&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.200
called "Goodnight Mommy". Spoilers&nbsp;
ahead! Watch out and take care!
&nbsp;

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.960
A family consists of a mommy and her two twins&nbsp;
named Lukas and Elias. They have just moved to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.600
a new house in the middle of the forest and near&nbsp;
a lake. Mommy used to be a choir member who was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:25.120
quite famous on local tv. One day, Lukas and&nbsp;
Elias play hide and seek around their house.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.160
Realizing that their mother has returned home,&nbsp;
the two immediately rush to meet their mother,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.560
but all they see is a woman with a bandage&nbsp;
covering almost her entire face. That woman&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.760
is their mother who had cosmetic facial surgery.&nbsp;
This makes Lucas and Elias quite surprised but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.960
still obey her orders. But there is something&nbsp;
strange going on. Mommy only gives her attention&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.960
to Elias for no apparent reason. She provides food&nbsp;
and drinks only to Elias, plays only with Elias,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.840
and only responds to Elias's words while Lucas&nbsp;
is ignored. Because she is still in the healing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.640
stage, mommy also makes some new rules, such as&nbsp;
the house must be in a state of complete silence.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.520
There should be no visitors, no animals, no&nbsp;
bringing in things from outside, the house&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:09.440
curtains must always be closed and they are&nbsp;
only allowed to play outside the house quietly.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.640
Seeing their mother's strange behaviour, the twins&nbsp;
begin to suspect that beneath her bandages, their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.320
mother may not be the same person. Mommy also acts&nbsp;
cruelly and lashes out at Elias physically when he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.720
is naughty or disobedient. The boys comment that&nbsp;
this is something their mother would never do.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.280
This makes Lucas and Elias even more convinced&nbsp;
that mommy is not their mother because their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.000
mother would not scold them like that. In a dream&nbsp;
that the twins seem to share, the boys' mother&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.760
wanders into the woods in only her underwear. She&nbsp;
disrobes completely, then unravels her bandages.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:44.720
Her head begins to spasm and spin.
The next day, Lucas and Elias deliberately&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.600
create troubles as a form of opposition. A fight&nbsp;
breaks out, with the twins insisting they want&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.880
their mommy back. Their mother thinks her children&nbsp;
have lost their minds. When Elias asserts she's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.280
not his mom, Mommy punishes and forces him&nbsp;
to say ten times that she's his real mother.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.880
She also tells him to stop talking to Lucas.&nbsp;
Elias becomes very sad, knowing that mommy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:10.320
wants to separate the two of them. A few days&nbsp;
have passed. Lucas and Elias still hate mommy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:15.200
and want their real mother to return soon.&nbsp;
Later that day, mommy wants to meet them both;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.080
she states that she is not angry anymore. Mommy&nbsp;
immediately enters the room with a new face&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.960
that is not covered by bandages, but Lukas and&nbsp;
Elias are still not sure that she is his mother,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.360
even after comparing her to the old photo&nbsp;
of her mother. Mommy gives a boomerang as a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.000
form of apology for what has happened earlier.&nbsp;
Elias immediately asks mommy's permission to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.920
play boomerang outside the house. As soon as mommy&nbsp;
opens the back door, the kids run for their lives.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.480
They escape into town and eventually make their&nbsp;
way to an old church and ask for the priest.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.720
The priest promises to drive them to the police&nbsp;
station to report the impostor posing as their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.760
mother, but he tricks them and brings them right&nbsp;
back home. The priest asks the mother to explain,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.440
but she just vaguely talks about how things&nbsp;
have been difficult since the accident and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:03.120
the separation. Mommy returns inside but can't&nbsp;
find Elias or Lukas anywhere. She eventually&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.160
gives up and cries herself to sleep. That same&nbsp;
night, Lucas and Elias do something to mommy.  
&nbsp;

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:12.000
She wakes in the morning to the vision&nbsp;
of her twins in their homemade goblin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.560
masks – and the realization she's bound&nbsp;
to the bed. The twins have tied her down,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.680
making it impossible for her to escape. Just&nbsp;
then, Lucas and Elias begin to inquire about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.200
the whereabouts of their real mother.
. She insists that she is their mother,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.520
Lucas and Elias begin to compare&nbsp;
their real mother's photo with mommy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.680
They have a fight because Elias has started to&nbsp;
believe that mommy is their real mother , while&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.480
Lucas is still convinced that mommy isn't&nbsp;
their mother. When mommy is alone with Elias,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.960
mommy keeps trying to convince Elias that she is&nbsp;
his real mother and tells Elias to let her free.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:48.320
Slowly, Elias starts to cut her feet loose,&nbsp;
but is stopped when Lukas returns and asks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:52.560
what he's doing. He demonstrates that&nbsp;
mommy's facial birthmark easily rubs off.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.360
Mommy tells them that they took it off in&nbsp;
surgery; Elias doesn't believe it and slaps her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.960
That moment, Lukas and Elias ask again about his&nbsp;
mother's whereabouts while torturing mommy in very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:08.640
unnatural ways. The torture they do is extremely&nbsp;
insane. Mommy is tied up on the bed for days.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:14.240
She wets her bed. The twins briefly set her&nbsp;
free from her shackles to change the bedding.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:20.000
Mommy immediately uses this opportunity to escape.&nbsp;
The twins, however, have set up a booby trap that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.960
causes her to fall, knocking her unconscious. 
The woman wakes glued to the living room floor.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.280
Elias starts to burn down the house to pressure&nbsp;
her into telling them the truth about their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:34.400
mother. Mommy, in a final bid for her life,&nbsp;
tells Elias she'll play along if he frees her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.880
She'll pretend Lukas is alive again,&nbsp;
make his breakfast – whatever he wants. 
&nbsp;

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:44.480
Then, she tearfully explains to Elias that Lukas'&nbsp;
death was not his fault and she begs her son to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:49.200
set her free, so they can both move on from&nbsp;
the tragedy. Now, this is where everything is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:54.160
revealed! Lukas has been dead! Lukas has&nbsp;
been merely a hallucination as a result&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:59.040
of dissociative identity disorder, as Elias is&nbsp;
incapable of accepting his other half's demise.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:03.440
Mommy initially plays along with Elias,&nbsp;
acting as if Lukas was still around.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:09.040
For Elias, Lukas is real, but not for Mommy.&nbsp;
Elias then challenges her to prove that she is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:14.160
their mother by telling him what Lukas is doing.&nbsp;
Lukas is holding a torch near the curtain, but,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.880
obviously, the mother can't see that. Elias&nbsp;
believes that his real mother could see Lukas.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:24.080
He takes then the torch from Lukas and sets&nbsp;
the curtain aflame. The flames explode across&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:29.040
the living room. Soon, it engulfs Mommy&nbsp;
in flames. She dies a fiery death. 
&nbsp;

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:34.720
The movie ends with the firefighters extinguishing&nbsp;
the fire but arriving too late to save mommy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:38.480
The final shot of the film shows Elias&nbsp;
and Lukas walking through the cornfield&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:41.840
and emerging to be with their mother, the&nbsp;
three of them smiling and embracing. 
&nbsp;

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:44.720
And that's the ending of the&nbsp;
movie "Goodnight Mommy".
&nbsp;

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:50.880
Now, for the explanation. The lady in the house is&nbsp;
the real Mother. She is not an impersonator with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:56.000
devious intentions. A loving family in a beautiful&nbsp;
home was destroyed because of a divorce and a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.960
son’s death. All Mommy is trying to do is get a&nbsp;
fresh start, and she does this by getting plastic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:06.240
surgery. As part of the fresh start, Mommy also&nbsp;
sold the old house and move to a different place.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:11.200
Mommy initially plays along with Elias,&nbsp;
acting as if Lukas was still around.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:16.400
But she grows tired of this. It gets to a point&nbsp;
where she even beats and threatens Elias to stop&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:21.280
talking to his dead brother. Finally, at the&nbsp;
end of the movie, we are shown this perfect&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:26.560
family portrait dissolves into ashes. It’s clear&nbsp;
this frame is an ironic representation of how it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:30.960
would have turned out without the accident&nbsp;
that took Lukas’s life. Elias’s whereabouts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:35.360
after the fire remain a mystery.
