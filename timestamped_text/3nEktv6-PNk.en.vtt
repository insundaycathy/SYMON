welcome to thriller recapped and today i will
show you a british psychological thriller

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:12.839
film called exam spoilers ahead watch out
and take care around the year 2050 most of

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:17.960
the population of earth is infected with a
harmful contagious disease to fight the problem

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:23.630
a pharmaceutical company called dataprev is
working on finding a cure for the disease

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.949
in britain eight mandatory candidates dress
for what appears to be an employment assessment

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:34.300
exam the group enter a room and sit at individual
desks each desk has a paper printed with a

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:41.260
word candidate and a number from one to eight
the invigilator enters the exam room he lets

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.500
the group know that many people has tried
this employment exam before and failed and

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.220
he states that the person who clears the exam
will be given an employment letter and those

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:54.090
who fail will be given the bus ticket for
home he then explains that the exam is 80

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.100
minutes and consists of only one question
but there are three important rules the candidates

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.989
must not talk to him or the armed guard at
the door must not spoil their paper and may

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:10.120
not leave the room if they do they will be
disqualified the invigilator asks them if

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:16.250
they have any questions then leaves as the
exam starts all the candidates tries to look

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:22.740
for the question however it turns out that
the papers are otherwise blank within minutes

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.010
an asian candidate gets upset and she starts
writing on paper that she deserves better

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:33.820
breaking the rule of exam by spoiling paper
and she is disqualified maybe she didn't deserve

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:40.050
better after her rejection the seven remaining
candidates starts exploring things and trying

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:45.080
to find loopholes in the exam structure since
they couldn't find the question after a moment

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.990
of thinking they realize that it is permissible
to talk to each other and to collaborate as

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:56.850
well then one very usual unexpected thing
happens one candidate white assigns nicknames

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.460
to each candidate based on hair color and
skin color one guy is named black based on

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:08.840
his skin color another girl is called blonde
indian guy is called gandhi the guy gets upset

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.950
and he says he prefers himself called brown
instead and so on a girl is named brunette

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.360
and dark she gets upset and says it's not
nice of him to be racist in exam but white

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.140
says that since they're not allowed to share
the real names this is the best way and they

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:31.210
all agree lastly the silent and very detached
guy not talking to the group is named f in

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:38.060
the hour that follows they figure out that
it's not about the answer it's about the question

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:44.740
white says they need to help each other as
a team brown says why should i help you we

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:49.950
are in competition white says in order to
establish the question they need us to work

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:56.330
together we need observation teamwork dark
says we are put in a stress situation to bring

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:02.370
out the worse in us black says maybe to bring
out best of us then they all agree to work

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:08.390
together later they figure out that question
maybe be hidden in the paper and they need

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:16.600
to decipher it black says it can be a watermark
brunette says it can be hidden ink brown says

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:21.069
there might be different questions to all
of them and they are not meant to cooperate

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:24.760
black disagrees and says there might be one
question in among all the papers so they need

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.010
to work together continuing black says the
question might be hidden and will be only

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:34.760
visible if required lights are used so white
decides to break the bulbs one by one with

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.900
a chair thinking ultraviolet lights will be
turned on revealing the question it seems

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:44.220
they're right about the light but the question
is still not revealed and they fail however

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:49.490
they realize that room might have a lot of
other hidden ways to reveal the question dark

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:54.770
sees that there is more light under the blue
light so they decide to break it as well since

00:03:54.770 --> 00:04:00.349
black thinks that the infrared light behind
the bulbs can reveal the text later after

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:06.569
breaking the lighting they're still not able
to figure out anything at this point we can

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:11.860
say that they're losing patience and they
are running out of time white recalls what

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:16.890
invigilator said that they're not allowed
to spoil their paper but they might be allowed

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:22.290
to spoil other person's paper so they take
the paper of asian girl who is already disqualified

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:27.680
and white starts using the pencil on it the
trace and reveal the question but they fail

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:33.710
again white thinks it might be revealed if
they use some sort of liquid on it so white

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:39.320
goes in the corner and he decides to take
a piece on the paper everyone is disgusted

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:45.720
and he fails to shockingly they hear def uttering
something they go to him and realize he is

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:51.130
speaking french dark is the only one who can
understand french she tries to talk to him

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:59.240
and he says to see clearly is all needed white
makes fun of him however brown says that it's

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:03.590
strange that they all are brought here and
all of them come from a different ethnic background

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:09.100
and he states that it might be an experiment
or a game and they're betting on them later

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:13.320
they speculate on the exam's purpose and the
nature of the company whose identity is shrouded

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:18.560
in mystery dark claims that the ceo is highly
secretive and has not been seen since the

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:23.820
pandemic it is gradually revealed that the
company is responsible for a miracle drug

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:27.800
designed to treat a condition afflicting a
large part of the population due to a viral

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:32.770
pandemic black says the company has found
the cure and the person who gets the job will

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:38.360
get the cure as well making him live for 80
years at least as the test is 80 minutes upon

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:43.300
hearing that burnett says that her husband
is infected from the pandemic and he will

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:48.730
die if he won't get the cure black says we
are in this together she says she don't need

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:54.030
his help later she goes to the guard and puts
his hand as pocket then she shows them the

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:59.360
finger checking another pocket of guard she
takes a lighter out upon seeing only the lighter

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:04.270
coming out of the pocket white is disappointed
but black says heat might have an effect on

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:09.360
the paper if it is chemically treated vernette
says if they're chemically treated then in

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:13.580
the water sprinkling pipes they might have
replaced water with a chemical and that way

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:18.630
they can decipher the text on the paper using
the developing fluid in the pipes so they

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:23.610
start preparing for an attempt to decipher
the paper everyone hides their paper in order

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:31.040
not to spoil it meanwhile we see deaf strangely
going next to the clock and touching it there

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:37.440
is a chaos in the room later we see brunette
tries to turn on the fire alarm white says

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:44.180
he will help her and he brings a paper and
burns it to start the fire alarm finally the

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:50.370
fire alarm goes off they all get excited however
they find out that it's just water in the

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:56.640
pipes not any special liquid after the chaos
they find out that white used brunettes paper

00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:01.710
to turn the alarms on the guard approaches
her everyone is shocked and in pain and we

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:07.060
see brunette getting disqualified all the
candidates except white seems upset and black

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:13.240
is raging out he then asks him why did he
do this which white replies there was no other

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:18.460
choice black says then i should punch the
lights out of you and the room light turns

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:23.970
off this makes brown think that the room is
also voice controlled then he says lights

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:31.360
on and normal lights are back blonde tells
them to be careful of what they say from now

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:38.259
later we see dev crying out of seeing everything
we can say that he is having a nervous breakdown

00:07:38.259 --> 00:07:44.180
white goes to him and asks him if he's hungry
by saying i'm hungry and angry upon hearing

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:49.889
no reply from death white gets irritated and
starts emotionally torturing him also makes

00:07:49.889 --> 00:07:54.370
him tear and eat the paper then we see guard
approaching to death and throwing him out

00:07:54.370 --> 00:08:01.530
poor guy drops his glasses as the door closes
white starts smiling and he says now only

00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:08.500
five of us are left at this point we can say
that upon given slightest pressure humans

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:14.860
can overpass animals when it comes to their
own survival black disappointedly says that

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:19.430
aren't you the one who asked all of us to
cooperate and work in team earlier which white

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:26.720
replies that he lied and they shouldn't trust
him black says that they won't help him anymore

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:31.570
which white replies that he has figure out
the question and he is not going to share

00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:39.319
it with them black has it all by now and he
knocks down white with a superman punch blonde

00:08:39.319 --> 00:08:44.600
says we may need him however black replies
by saying he is an enemy of the group in a

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:52.610
distraction black then goes towards white
and lifts him he also asks for help to brown

00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:56.809
then they both tie him down on the chair

00:08:56.809 --> 00:09:01.069
as white may death eat the paper black takes
the socks out of white's feet and puts it

00:09:01.069 --> 00:09:06.589
in his mouth by saying this is karma and justice
being served dark says you could have done

00:09:06.589 --> 00:09:13.199
more then black says that they should kick
him out of the door brown asks him if he believes

00:09:13.199 --> 00:09:19.649
in forgiveness black replies that he will
forgive him but after the exam blonde stops

00:09:19.649 --> 00:09:24.350
them and reminds them the rule of individualator
that they cannot go outside the room or they'll

00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:30.830
be disqualified to so black stops but he's
still not done with him so he takes a pencil

00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:38.059
and tries to make him spoil the paper then
white wakes up and he tries to say something

00:09:38.059 --> 00:09:45.429
black gives him a batman slap and says shut
up later dark takes the socks out of his mouth

00:09:45.429 --> 00:09:51.220
white says that he needs medication he takes
a pill every hour black says only one condition

00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:56.550
is treated that way by saying white is infected
with the virus white begs that he need pills

00:09:56.550 --> 00:10:02.649
urgently or he will not survive to see the
next day black says only if he will tell them

00:10:02.649 --> 00:10:09.060
the question then black checks his both the
pockets but finds nothing dark says that this

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:13.759
is a pathetic trick and white might be a spy
planted by the company to make them fight

00:10:13.759 --> 00:10:21.269
with one another brown says or you are the
spy by saying white is not smart enough to

00:10:21.269 --> 00:10:28.269
be a seed but dark is she is studying psychology
and reverse psychology brown says he is a

00:10:28.269 --> 00:10:34.000
famous gambler and he has studied it as well
stops them by saying any one of us can be

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:40.519
seed and we have to trust each other in order
to survive the test brown says see the thing

00:10:40.519 --> 00:10:47.680
is trust has to be earned sister and ties
dark with his belt to the chair later then

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:53.100
he starts interrogating her brown asks her
to tell us the truth dark replies she can't

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:57.980
say anything because she don't know anything
and that she worked for hr not with the ceo's

00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:04.069
office brown is not buying it and he goes
to the table and brings a paper he then says

00:11:04.069 --> 00:11:09.699
that a delicate thing like paper can make
a big wound if used properly then he tells

00:11:09.699 --> 00:11:15.230
blonde that's how they used to interrogate
people in special forces he lifts the skirt

00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:19.910
of dark and finds scar of soft injury then
he makes fun by saying she might have daddy

00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:26.300
issues and makes a new cut black says that's
enough and he goes to help dark but brown

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:31.619
gives him a punch instead and warns everyone
not to interfere he then removes the glasses

00:11:31.619 --> 00:11:37.100
of dark and says eyes are the most delicate
as well dark is screaming that she told everything

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:45.160
she knows at this point brown realizes that
she is saying the truth blonde goes to dark

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:50.679
and gives her a bandage by saying it's okay
later we see white having seizure everyone

00:11:50.679 --> 00:11:55.880
goes to him blonde says that we need to get
him pills black says he lost his wife like

00:11:55.880 --> 00:12:00.360
this and they need to hurry blonde says if
they can't trust each other then they need

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:05.589
to search each other then black starts searching
brown and dark starts searching blonde and

00:12:05.589 --> 00:12:12.309
so on however they found nothing dark notices
that brown is not having his gum anymore she

00:12:12.309 --> 00:12:17.800
goes to his table and finds the pill stick
to it she grabs the pill and goes to white

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:22.540
brown stops her by saying let's think about
this again black stops him and says we are

00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:27.879
saving his life and brown pushes him making
the pill go in the drainage black couldn't

00:12:27.879 --> 00:12:33.230
get it out so blonde takes her hairpin and
she tries to grab the pill we see white's

00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:38.389
condition worsening dark tells the camera
that can't you see he is dying she breaks

00:12:38.389 --> 00:12:44.779
the rule the guard comes and throws her out
everyone is shocked blonde gets the pill and

00:12:44.779 --> 00:12:50.360
she gets it to white black goes to him and
white says hey losers making them relive that

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:54.940
he's alive white makes fun of them by saying
they haven't figured out the question yet

00:12:54.940 --> 00:13:00.040
and few minutes are left brown asks him to
fulfill the promise of pill and now it's his

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:04.910
turn to give them the question white finally
reveals that there is no question and we need

00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:10.299
to eliminate each other in order to win white
then tells black that he's weak and they both

00:13:10.299 --> 00:13:15.959
look at the gun in guard's holster they both
run towards the guard to take the gun black

00:13:15.959 --> 00:13:22.129
overpowers him and takes the gun from holster
brown and blonde try to calm him down however

00:13:22.129 --> 00:13:27.610
white provokes him and says that black is
weak and he won't shoot at him then white

00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:33.519
starts walking towards black making him press
the trigger but the gun won't fire upon seeing

00:13:33.519 --> 00:13:38.509
opportunity white attacks black and stabs
him with a pencil like john wick and takes

00:13:38.509 --> 00:13:44.569
his gun then white realizes that gun has a
fingerprint lock on it so he goes to the guard

00:13:44.569 --> 00:13:50.879
and points the gun at brown asking him to
leave or he will be dead brown surrenders

00:13:50.879 --> 00:13:56.769
and walks towards the door later white points
the gun at black by saying he will take care

00:13:56.769 --> 00:14:03.149
of him in the end then he asks blonde to leave
the room or she will be dead as well she goes

00:14:03.149 --> 00:14:07.759
to the door we see blonde standing at the
door while white points at her she says lights

00:14:07.759 --> 00:14:14.069
out and lights go off in order to give an
opportunity for black to overpower white however

00:14:14.069 --> 00:14:19.699
white fire multiple rounds shooting black
in the chest black sees the wound and he falls

00:14:19.699 --> 00:14:25.569
to the ground we see blonde hiding near the
door white notices it and goes towards her

00:14:25.569 --> 00:14:33.059
to shoot her at the same time the timer goes
to zero upon seeing that white steps back

00:14:33.059 --> 00:14:37.089
blonde takes a deep breath and she sees the
glasses of death and she remembers what he

00:14:37.089 --> 00:14:43.649
said to them white is unrest and he tells
the camera that where is my employment letter

00:14:43.649 --> 00:14:48.040
however we see guard approaching him and showing
the real time that there are still few seconds

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:53.730
left white recalls that during the chaos def
went next to the clock and pressed a button

00:14:53.730 --> 00:14:58.869
to make it fast white cannot process that
he lost and he looks at black dead on the

00:14:58.869 --> 00:15:04.549
floor he has remorse and tries to shoot himself
but gun is locked and the guard throws him

00:15:04.549 --> 00:15:09.239
out blonde garbs a piece of broken glass and
glasses of death then she goes and gets the

00:15:09.239 --> 00:15:15.009
paper she put the glasses on the broken glass
on one another and now she can see the text

00:15:15.009 --> 00:15:20.209
she sees question one written on the paper
everything makes sense to her now we see def

00:15:20.209 --> 00:15:24.199
entering the room she goes towards him with
the paper and gives him his glasses and she

00:15:24.199 --> 00:15:28.379
says the answer is no recalling how the invigilator
asked them in the beginning if they have any

00:15:28.379 --> 00:15:33.810
questions and the answer was no the invigilator
says you're hired now but she says i don't

00:15:33.810 --> 00:15:38.559
want the job that is based on other people's
dead bodies invigilator points towards black

00:15:38.559 --> 00:15:43.939
and says is he dead she goes to him and finds
out the wound is healing she is shocked to

00:15:43.939 --> 00:15:48.899
see it healing then invigilator explains it
to her that when they were trying to find

00:15:48.899 --> 00:15:54.380
the cure for the virus they accidentally discovered
a formula to manipulate dna and make wounds

00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:59.149
heal drastically further he says that they
need someone trustworthy to find the cure

00:15:59.149 --> 00:16:04.699
and help people we see black coming back to
life then he grabs the cross and makes a prayer

00:16:04.699 --> 00:16:11.529
def asks her to join the company then we see
her accepting to work with them and the movie
