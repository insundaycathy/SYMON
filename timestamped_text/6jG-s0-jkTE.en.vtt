00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:03.280
Hey everyone...

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.022
Welcome back to Movie Recap.

00:00:05.022 --> 00:00:07.102
Today I'm gonna show you a movie called,

00:00:07.102 --> 00:00:08.115
Polaroid.

00:00:08.115 --> 00:00:12.739
It is a 2019 American supernatural horror film directed by Lars Klevberg,

00:00:12.739 --> 00:00:16.282
and is based on his 2015 short film of the same name.

00:00:16.282 --> 00:00:18.324
The movie is about high school student

00:00:18.324 --> 00:00:20.370
who finds a vintage Polaroid camera

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:22.716
that holds dark and mysterious secrets.

00:00:22.716 --> 00:00:24.453
Let s start!

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.215
The film starts with Sarah and her friend going through a box

00:00:37.215 --> 00:00:40.380
of her late mother's stuff when they find a Polaroid camera.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.620
The friend received a "LIKE" from her crush,

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.820
which provokes Sarah to take a photo in lingerie on the Polaroid camera.

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.688
When the flash goes off, Sarah seems uneasy.

00:00:49.688 --> 00:00:52.599
Her friend leaves, and Sarah is home alone.

00:00:52.599 --> 00:00:54.482
When she takes a look at the Polaroid,

00:00:54.482 --> 00:00:57.292
there is a creepy shadow behind her in the photo of her.

00:00:57.292 --> 00:01:00.540
Startled, she treats it as a smudge and starts cleaning.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.818
She hears eerie sounds in the attic, which she investigates.

00:01:03.818 --> 00:01:05.960
She gets frightened in the attic and falls,

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.516
but ends up dangling by her ankles instead of falling to the floor.

00:01:09.516 --> 00:01:13.429
While feeling a brief moment of relief as her hair dangles in her face,

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:16.419
she is then pulled up by an entity and is killed off screen

00:01:16.419 --> 00:01:19.236
before her dead body tumbles to the ground.

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.651
On the other scene, shy high school student,

00:01:22.651 --> 00:01:26.400
Bird is given an old Polaroid camera by her co-worker Tyler,

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.020
who got it from a garage sale.

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.542
The camera has the initials "RJS" carved into it.

00:01:31.542 --> 00:01:33.634
Bird snaps a picture of Tyler

00:01:33.634 --> 00:01:37.377
but later notices an odd smudge-like figure on his photo.

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.256
Bird attends a costume party with her best friend Kasey

00:01:42.256 --> 00:01:45.344
and meets her other friends Mina, Mina's boyfriend Devin,

00:01:45.344 --> 00:01:48.126
Avery, and Bird's high school crush Connor.

00:01:48.126 --> 00:01:51.840
She uses her Polaroid camera to take the group's picture

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.354
and Avery later snaps a selfie with it.

00:01:57.065 --> 00:01:59.371
Meanwhile, Tyler is killed by the entity,

00:01:59.371 --> 00:02:01.600
and Sheriff Pembroke informs Bird.

00:02:01.757 --> 00:02:04.935
At home, Bird sees Tyler's photo free from the shadow,

00:02:04.935 --> 00:02:08.232
which has mysteriously transferred to Avery's photo.

00:02:09.425 --> 00:02:11.971
Avery is killed when the entity snaps her neck.

00:02:11.971 --> 00:02:13.571
When Bird learns about this,

00:02:13.571 --> 00:02:16.828
she tries to destroy the camera and attempts to warn her friends.

00:02:16.828 --> 00:02:19.360
Devin attempts to burn the group photo

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.662
but when the flames reach Mina in the photo,

00:02:21.662 --> 00:02:23.727
her arm spontaneously combusts

00:02:23.727 --> 00:02:25.695
and the flames cannot be extinguished.

00:02:25.695 --> 00:02:29.698
Kasey's fingers are slightly singed before Bird stomps out the fire

00:02:29.698 --> 00:02:32.090
and the photograph restores it self.

00:02:34.385 --> 00:02:37.670
Mina is taken to the hospital to undergo surgery for her arm.

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.343
Devin and Kasey stay with her while Bird and Connor

00:02:40.343 --> 00:02:42.420
leave to learn more about the camera.

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:43.722
On the next scene,

00:02:43.722 --> 00:02:46.995
Bird is attacked by the entity, which behaves like a photograph,

00:02:46.995 --> 00:02:50.082
following the same rules as photographic development,

00:02:50.082 --> 00:02:51.360
it is sensitive to heat.

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.736
She questions why she was chased too

00:02:53.736 --> 00:02:57.000
and notices that her reflection is in the photo's background.

00:02:58.352 --> 00:03:00.614
Mina is killed at the hospital by the entity

00:03:00.614 --> 00:03:02.449
when she is left alone briefly.

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:06.245
Devin finds Mina's dead body and blames Bird for her death.

00:03:08.745 --> 00:03:10.711
Bird and Connor research and discover that

00:03:10.711 --> 00:03:13.060
the camera was owned by a photography teacher,

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.525
Roland Joseph Sable (RJS) from their school years ago.

00:03:16.525 --> 00:03:18.902
He was accused of torturing four students

00:03:18.902 --> 00:03:21.973
and killing three of them while taking maniacal photographs.

00:03:21.973 --> 00:03:25.661
One of the captives escaped and Roland was killed by police.

00:03:27.685 --> 00:03:29.677
Devin confronts Bird at the diner

00:03:29.677 --> 00:03:33.023
and accuses her of being responsible for what happened to Mina.

00:03:33.023 --> 00:03:35.489
He attempts to take a picture of her as a threat.

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:38.194
With Connor and Devin both fighting for the camera,

00:03:38.194 --> 00:03:40.576
Devin is accidentally snapped by the camera

00:03:40.576 --> 00:03:44.023
and the shadow transfers to his photo, showing he is next.

00:03:44.023 --> 00:03:48.822
Devin lunges at Bird, Kasey saves Bird by stabbing Devin's photo with a pencil,

00:03:48.822 --> 00:03:50.391
injuring him in real life.

00:03:50.391 --> 00:03:52.470
Devin upset from being stabbed

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.344
becomes aggressive and accidentally slaps a cop.

00:03:55.344 --> 00:03:59.744
Devin is detained by Pembroke and is later killed in his cell by the entity.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.020
Connor, Kasey, and Bird learn Roland's wife is alive and visit her.

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.603
They meet an elderly lady named Lena Sable,

00:04:12.603 --> 00:04:15.621
who explains that the camera actually belonged to her daughter

00:04:15.621 --> 00:04:17.982
Rebecca James Sable (RJS).

00:04:17.982 --> 00:04:20.306
Lena explains that Rebecca was "slow,"

00:04:20.306 --> 00:04:23.724
and when gifted with the camera she became very attached to it.

00:04:23.724 --> 00:04:26.976
As a result, Rebecca was bullied by four classmates,

00:04:26.976 --> 00:04:30.595
who took the camera and used it to take inappropriate photos of her.

00:04:30.595 --> 00:04:32.619
She committed suicide out of shame,

00:04:32.619 --> 00:04:36.671
causing her father Roland to abduct and kill her bullies in a fit of rage.

00:04:36.671 --> 00:04:38.879
Now even in death, Roland roams,

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:41.579
looking for the last bully who escaped to kill him.

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:44.777
Lena shows the two a picture of the survivor

00:04:44.777 --> 00:04:46.373
and they search the yearbooks.

00:04:46.373 --> 00:04:49.647
Bird finds out that the survivor was Sheriff Pembroke.

00:04:50.887 --> 00:04:53.215
In an attempt to stop the entity from killing them,

00:04:53.215 --> 00:04:55.067
Connor takes a picture of Pembroke,

00:04:55.067 --> 00:04:57.907
who reveals that Roland was the real bully to Rebecca,

00:04:57.907 --> 00:04:59.515
having sexually assaulted her.

00:04:59.515 --> 00:05:01.576
The four students including him,

00:05:01.576 --> 00:05:04.336
were Rebecca's friends trying to warn her of her father's actions

00:05:04.336 --> 00:05:07.137
upon finding her nude pictures in his possession.

00:05:07.137 --> 00:05:10.332
Fearing the public would find out, Roland abducted them,

00:05:10.332 --> 00:05:12.751
prompting Rebecca to kill herself in fear.

00:05:14.384 --> 00:05:17.757
The entity tears Pembroke's picture in half, killing him.

00:05:19.837 --> 00:05:23.708
The entity stabs through Kasey's leg, impairing her ability to walk.

00:05:23.708 --> 00:05:26.177
Conner is separated from Kasey and Bird.

00:05:26.177 --> 00:05:28.731
The girls find safety in the school's showers,

00:05:28.731 --> 00:05:31.498
with Bird turning on the hot water to create heat,

00:05:31.498 --> 00:05:33.570
preventing the entity from reaching them.

00:05:35.641 --> 00:05:37.250
Bird leaves to find Connor,

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:41.239
they reunite and she has an idea that involves getting the camera back.

00:05:41.239 --> 00:05:43.754
Having been left where Sheriff Pembroke was killed,

00:05:43.754 --> 00:05:46.773
and going somewhere where the entity can "fully develop."

00:05:46.773 --> 00:05:49.362
The entity manifests and drags Connor away,

00:05:49.362 --> 00:05:53.557
but Bird takes a picture of herself, prompting the creature to chase after her.

00:05:53.557 --> 00:05:56.248
She leads the entity into the school's dark room,

00:05:56.248 --> 00:05:58.037
where it is able to fully develop.

00:05:58.037 --> 00:06:01.964
She takes a picture of the entity, crushes the photo trying to kill it.

00:06:01.964 --> 00:06:05.731
Unsuccessful and fearing for her life she then burns it last minute

00:06:05.731 --> 00:06:09.518
disintegrating the entity where everything took place many years ago.

00:06:13.259 --> 00:06:15.011
On the last scene of this movie,

00:06:15.011 --> 00:06:18.778
she reunites with her friends and throws the camera into a river.

00:06:19.749 --> 00:06:21.196
Thanks for watching...

00:06:21.196 --> 00:06:22.937
