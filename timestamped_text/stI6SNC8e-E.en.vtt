00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.500
Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:06.210
Today, I'm going to explain an action, sci-fi,
and thriller film called “The Call Up."

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:07.500
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.500
Watch out and take care.&nbsp;

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.030
&nbsp;
Carl Anderson is a very skilled gamer who

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.770
lives alone in his apartment.

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:17.250
He wakes up to an alarm, which reminds him
of an important event, where he is recruited

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.960
along with other elite gamers.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.260
Excitedly, he makes his way through the busy
streets and enters a large building.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:34.739
Other players, Shelly, Marco, Andre, Edward,
Zahid, and Taylor, are waiting for the appointment

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.179
to begin when Carl and Adam arrive.

00:00:38.179 --> 00:00:40.989
All of them observe the place, confused about
the recruitment.

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:44.460
Out of nowhere, a voice from the intercom
welcomes them to Beta Testing; all of them

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.709
must sign in on the tablets provided for the
meeting to officially start.

00:00:47.709 --> 00:00:50.590
They are each assigned individual lockers
where they should deposit their valuables

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.469
and electronic devices.

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.559
After the sign-in process, they are instructed
to wear motion-capture suits for them to join.

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:00.399
As they change into uniforms, Shelly shares
a brief conversation with Carl; she notices

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:03.839
burn marks on him, but because the game is
about to commence, they do not have a chance

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:05.100
to talk about it.

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.670
All eight of them enter a room where a machine
scans them as they state their gamer names.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.770
After, they are given technologically advanced
gaming suits; these armors provide the closest

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.100
possible experience to modern warfare.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.009
Part of the suit is a helmet that secures
itself in the neck, chin, and jaw, restraining

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:20.700
them from removing it.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.040
Meanwhile, Zahid, the only Muslim player involved,
ironically chose his gamer name thinking that

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.189
it would be kept anonymous, and he refuses
to wear the armor that labels him as a terrorist.

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.229
He attempts to walk away, but the doors remain
locked, despite his pleads of being let out.

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:36.619
Shelly convinces him to participate in the
game, saying they all understand that he meant

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:38.119
for the name to be ironic.

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:41.840
A bit comforted by her words, Zahid calms
down and suits up.&nbsp;

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.280
&nbsp;
Once everyone is ready, the room where they

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.479
are stationed is replaced by a computer simulation
depicting a post-apocalyptic setting.

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:50.619
Amazed by this, all of them get giddy in their
new gear as well.

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:54.750
Carl tries to observe the place, opens his
visor, and sees the office as is, which means

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.020
that everything is just projected, and closes
his visor again.

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.139
As they look outside, a war-torn city is in
front of them.

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:04.299
While the other players enjoy the high-tech
features of the suit and the office, Zahid

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:08.250
is still concerned about the whole recruitment,
telling Carl that joining is a big mistake.

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.940
In a separate conversation, Shelly notices
that her tattoo has disappeared, thinking

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.360
that it is far from impossible.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.290
Suddenly, a simulated sergeant appears, calling
their attention and instructing them to fall

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:18.349
in line.

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:21.390
The sergeant acts aggressively toward them
as if he is a real person.

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.940
To check, Shelly tries to touch him and confirms
that he is a simulation.

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.430
The sergeant brings them to a room where they
collect their weapons and test them out.

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.160
Andre, who used to be a soldier, says that
the weapon is very realistic.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.239
After the trials, the sergeant explains that
it will cost them their armor when a bullet

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:36.459
hits them once.

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:40.430
He then demonstrates what will happen to Zahid;
the sergeant shoots him, and expectedly, the

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.030
armor disappears.

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.380
After the demonstration, he reminds them that
they are only given one armor during the game

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.350
and distributes tubes they can use once they
get hit.&nbsp;

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.960
&nbsp;
For the first round, the sergeant explains

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:53.280
that a group of highly trained terrorists
overruns the building; their job is to take

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.200
them out and clear the path to the bottom
of the building, starting at the 25th floor.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.959
He also adds that the gamer with the highest
score wins.

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:03.599
After the briefing, the voice counts to the
last seconds before the Call Up begins.

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:07.849
Andre leads the team given his combat expertise,
whereas Marco, Edward, and Adam follow him

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:09.930
intently, while the rest follow.

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.700
Out of nowhere, an enemy appears to shoot
the gamers.

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.390
Luckily, they can take cover as Andre shoots
him down, making them advance to the next

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:17.390
round.

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.770
As they move down to the lower floor, the
group encounters a roadblock, a live wire

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:22.110
with high voltage.

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.860
They safely pass through and collect more
advanced weapons on the 24th floor.

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.370
Only four are available, so Andre, Marco,
Edward, and Adam collect it, and Andre teaches

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.120
them how to use it properly.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.200
After Marco’s first kill, more shootings
commence, and they try to make their way to

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.329
a doorway.

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:39.569
Adam spots an enemy sitting in a room and
attempts to shoot him multiple times, but

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:41.909
his aim is weak, and all the bullets miss
him.

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:46.180
The enemy gets up to shoot Adam in return,
but Andre saves him, losing his armor in the

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:47.180
process.

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.050
Taylor becomes increasingly terrified and
reveals she just took her friend's place and

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:51.599
is not actually a gamer.

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:54.650
To comfort her, Shelly says that it is just
a game and that she will protect her until

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:55.909
the game ends.

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:58.940
She aims at one of the enemies patrolling
the room but hesitates to shoot.

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.450
However, the enemy notices her and approaches
their hiding place quietly.

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.989
Fortunately, Carl is alerted, making him plant
his first kill.

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:09.549
Little does he know, another enemy is hiding
for backup and shoots Carl twice, wounding

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:10.549
him.

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:13.590
Shelly comes to his rescue and is worried
when Carl is wounded and says the suit’s

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.359
feedback caused him actual pain.

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:19.400
Shelly removes her visor, seeing that Carl
is unwounded, so she removes his visor as

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:20.400
well.

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.940
He is still in pain as he says that something
is seriously wrong.

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.970
Andre enters the room and injects the tube
that was given to them earlier to relieve

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:30.100
Carl from the pain, this seems effective as
the wound disappears, but he remains nauseous.

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.720
He repeatedly says that it is not a game,
so the group gathers around to try and figure

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.450
out what is going on.&nbsp;

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:36.950
&nbsp;
Carl lets them all know that the pain came

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:39.750
from the suit and that they have to remove
it as soon as possible.

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.060
No matter how much they try, the suits are
locked and unremovable.

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.380
The group gets into an argument after Marco
and Zahid accuse Andre of knowing about the

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:50.760
experiment because of his exemplary skills
and military background, so he walks out.

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.780
While in a separate room, the enemies respawn
and get back up.

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.730
One of them approaches Andre, who apparently
cannot see them.

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:00.220
He hears a weapon behind him and lowers his
visor, only to find an enemy that shoots him

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:01.220
twice.

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:04.540
Because he gave the tube to Carl, he has nothing
to inject himself with, causing him extreme

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:05.540
pain.

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:09.061
The rest of them hear the gunshots and wear
the visor again, when moments later, Edward

00:05:09.061 --> 00:05:11.690
gets shot, causing the others to run away.

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:15.600
Taylor runs to the staircase but is blocked
by the live wire; hopelessly scared, she screams

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.230
to let her out of the game.

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:20.540
While Andre drags himself out of the room,
Adam throws a grenade at the enemies, which

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:22.280
causes a loud explosion.

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.760
The voice then announces that the second round
has ended, giving Adam the highest score.

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:29.630
Meanwhile, Andre’s helmet lets out some
alarm before it electrocutes him.

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:32.810
The group finds his body and realizes that
their helmets have been programmed to deliver

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:34.970
a deadly shock on their character's death.

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:37.240
Shelly tries to revive Andre, but it is too
late.&nbsp;

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.880
&nbsp;
Desperate to have the suit off, Zahid asks

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:43.080
Carl to remove and smash his helmet, which
he cannot do.

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.370
Before they can get the helmet off, the sergeant
enters the room to beat Zahid and warns them

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:48.100
all against further tampering.

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:51.310
With no other choice, they have to play the
game and go to the next level.

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:54.960
They reach the 19th floor safely, where the
sergeant awaits their arrival.

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:58.000
He lets them know that a gas leak is present
at the current level, limiting them to using

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.340
only knives.

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:02.580
Looking out the window, Taylor cries out of
fear, but again, Shelly tells her to stay

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:05.630
behind her, as she will get her out of the
building in no time.

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:10.180
Already on the 17th floor, the game continues
while the group gets more experience in shooting.

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:14.330
However, an enemy shoots Adam, throwing him
across the room and causing him much pain.

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:18.150
As a nurse, Shelly’s instinct is to rescue
him, so Carl looks out for her but gets shot

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:19.560
in the process.

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:22.970
Seeing her two teammates injured, she has
a dilemma on who to give the tube to, but

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:26.000
luckily, Marco injects his on Carl, and Shelly’s
on Adam.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.120
They clear the level again, with Marco earning
the highest points.&nbsp;

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.220
&nbsp;
Afterwards, Zahid overlooks the busy city

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:32.940
in a desperate desire to be outside.

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:36.710
He and Carl attempt to break a window that
slightly cracks using a photocopy machine.

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:40.680
Unfortunately, the sergeant appears before
they complete the task; he beats Zahid recklessly

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:43.830
and kicks him down the stairs, causing Zahid
to break his leg.

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:47.210
The sergeant reminds them that the following
violation will result in death.

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:50.880
As the next level is activated, Zahid realizes
his teammates cannot carry him to the end

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:53.750
of the game, so he stays behind as the others
continue.

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:57.020
Shelly is hesitant about leaving him behind,
but she assures him that they will come back

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:58.210
for him.&nbsp;

00:06:58.210 --> 00:06:59.880
&nbsp;
The group is now on the 11th floor, where

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:01.760
they find a weapon in a box.

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:05.430
Edward gets a hold of it first, but Marco
snatches it out of his hands; at this point,

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:07.660
it is clear who has the authority to lead.

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:11.680
Not long after, an enemy shoots Marco on the
lower part of his body, which causes a commotion

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:12.720
among them.

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:16.770
They all take cover, and Taylor becomes separated
from the group as she hides in a bathroom.

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:20.580
With a knife being her only weapon, the situation
grows out of her favor, and she ends up crying

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:21.900
in a cubicle.

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:25.640
Once Marco’s strength is regenerated, Shelly
realizes that Taylor is now out of sight,

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:28.200
she calls out for her, but there is no response.

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:31.310
An enemy enters the bathroom, where Taylor
is heard whimpering.

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:34.780
Forced to take defense to save herself, she
kills an enemy on her own and becomes more

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:35.780
confident.

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:39.080
After that level, the group takes a break
to save energy for the next one.

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:42.370
After sharing about their lives and what they
do, the team realizes they were picked not

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:45.560
because they were elite gamers but because
they have one common denominator: they are

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:46.590
all loners.

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:49.710
The chances of anyone looking for them when
they are gone are low, saving the company

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:50.810
from any legal matters.&nbsp;

00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:53.151
&nbsp;
More determined to defeat the company, they

00:07:53.151 --> 00:07:54.870
advance to the next level.

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:58.370
Back on the higher floor, an unseen enemy
approaches Zahid as he lays on the floor and

00:07:58.370 --> 00:07:59.620
shoots him to death.

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:03.270
On the 9th floor, the group sees the sergeant’s
silhouette beating someone up.

00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:06.560
He reveals a captive enemy and instructs the
players to torture him for information on

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:08.510
a bomb wired to the foundations of the building.

00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:12.680
If it explodes, the building will collapse,
which will mean death for the team.

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:15.900
Only the captive knows the code for disarming
it, and they have to extract that information

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:18.120
from him through any means necessary.

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:21.940
Edward volunteers and proceeds to torture
him further as they are in a race with time.

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:25.680
After several jolts of electricity, the captive
cannot take it any longer and gives a password

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:26.700
“pushkin.”

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:29.440
Adam inputs the word “pushkin” to the
computer console when suddenly the lights

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:30.680
shut down.

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:34.419
Instead of being put to safety, an explosive
device in the basement is initiated and starts

00:08:34.419 --> 00:08:36.729
a 30-minute countdown before it detonates.

00:08:36.729 --> 00:08:39.669
The captive laughs at them for being fooled
and believing that the keyword would leave

00:08:39.669 --> 00:08:40.669
them to safety.

00:08:40.669 --> 00:08:44.180
Out of anger, Taylor shoots him dead, which
is highly unexpected of her.

00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:47.399
Marco becomes agitated and aggressive toward
Adam, whom he blames for putting them in a

00:08:47.399 --> 00:08:49.040
dangerous situation.

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:52.300
When Shelly tries to stop him, she gets punched
by him as well.

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:55.500
Moments later, the sergeant calls out for
them while he holds a door; they all run to

00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:58.899
an elevator to a lower floor, unsure what
will welcome them.

00:08:58.899 --> 00:09:02.870
Marco grabs the door as everyone exits, but
it suddenly closes when it is Adam’s turn.

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:05.930
His hatred toward him grows, making Adam fear
for his life.

00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:09.959
They both descend further to the third floor
while Shelly, Carl, Edward, and Taylor continue

00:09:09.959 --> 00:09:11.470
clearing an upper level.

00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:15.820
Now that the bomb is down to 24 minutes, they
feel more urgency to get to the lower floor.

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:19.279
Meanwhile, Marco and Adam are still on their
own when they hear distant noises of enemies

00:09:19.279 --> 00:09:20.810
from another room.

00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:24.089
Marco uses Adam as bait for the enemies as
they advance, leaving Adam to die when he

00:09:24.089 --> 00:09:25.360
is fatally shot.

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:29.310
It causes Adam to be in a state of panic before
being electrocuted by the helmet.

00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:31.370
Despite being saved, he breaks into tears
out of guilt.&nbsp;

00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:34.000
&nbsp;
On the upper floor, the group is still ambushed

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.120
by enemies as they run out of bullets.

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:39.910
While the enemies are busy shooting, Taylor
decides to gather medical kits alone.

00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:43.050
She flees from the scene and goes to a room
where a medical tube lies.

00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:47.170
As she turns back, Marco commands her to hand
over the tube, but she refuses.

00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:50.959
He shoots her and says that she reminds him
of his ex-wife, and walks out of the room.

00:09:50.959 --> 00:09:54.820
Carl calls out for her, and he sees Marco
leave a room; he instantly suspects that Marco

00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:57.959
is behind her death after seeing "Atlas" written
in Taylor's blood.

00:09:57.959 --> 00:10:01.560
Vengeful and filled with rage, Carl attacks
Marco and gets in a brawl with him that damages

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:04.910
his helmet and causes the sergeant to walk
in and kill Marco.&nbsp;

00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:07.180
&nbsp;
With only the three of them alive, Carl, Shelly,

00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:10.100
and Edward make their way to the basement
floor as the voice announces that they are

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:11.430
on the final level.

00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:14.640
They reload weapons before taking down four
enemies in an ambush.

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:18.180
The shootout lasts for minutes, which takes
their time to disarm the bomb.

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:22.190
Down to the last three minutes, a bipod-mounted
machine gun shoots both Carl and Shelly, leaving

00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:23.329
them helpless.

00:10:23.329 --> 00:10:26.879
Carl sacrifices himself to save Shelly by
using the last tube on her; she holds his

00:10:26.879 --> 00:10:29.329
hand as she looks at him with his dying breath.

00:10:29.329 --> 00:10:32.760
During that, Edward manages to kill the machine
gunner using a rocket launcher and runs to

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:35.610
the bomb, shutting it down just before it
explodes.

00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:39.130
The two of them are the remaining survivors
of the game; the sergeant walks in and congratulates

00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:40.149
both of them.

00:10:40.149 --> 00:10:44.300
Shelly watches Edward recite the victory speech
and realizes he memorizes it by heart, meaning

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:45.440
he must be the inside guy.&nbsp;

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:47.889
&nbsp;
She is still not relieved after being alive

00:10:47.889 --> 00:10:49.529
and surviving the horrors of the game.

00:10:49.529 --> 00:10:53.009
The graphics lift, making the office go back
to normal again when security guards enter

00:10:53.009 --> 00:10:55.660
the room and hand Edward refreshments as if
they serve him.

00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:58.870
The guards tranquilize Shelly and leave her
unconscious in the basement.

00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:02.470
She then wakes up earlier than expected, only
to find the others being body-bagged, and

00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:06.110
Edward tells her that she's won the game before
giving her a large bag full of money.

00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:09.790
Although fearful of her life, she still threatens
to reveal Edward's involvement in the brutal

00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:11.920
murders, but he says nobody will believe her.

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:15.329
As one guard approaches her again, she is
able to inject the tranquilizer into him and

00:11:15.329 --> 00:11:18.339
grabs his pistol, killing the remaining guards
in a shootout.

00:11:18.339 --> 00:11:22.199
The sounds of the bullets worry Edward, anxiously
waiting for his guards to show up unharmed.

00:11:22.199 --> 00:11:25.779
However, Shelly emerges from the dark and
points the gun directly at him as he appeals

00:11:25.779 --> 00:11:27.000
for mercy.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.670
Feeling betrayed, she is insistent that the
game must never happen again, shoots him,

00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:38.830
and leaves peacefully without the money.
