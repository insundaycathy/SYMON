The majority of the film takes place aboard&nbsp;
a high-speed train travelling from Seoul to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:19.840
Busan while a zombie apocalypse strikes the&nbsp;
country, endangering the passengers' lives.

There will be Spoilers ahead,&nbsp;
so please proceed with caution.

A chemical spill at a biotech company sparks a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.560
zombie outbreak that quickly&nbsp;
sweeps over South Korea.

her birthday in Busan with her mother.&nbsp;&nbsp;

despite the fact that she already owns one.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.400

elderly sisters In-gil and Jong-gil; and a&nbsp;
homeless stowaway are among the other passengers.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.400
Before the train departs, indications of the&nbsp;
illness spread throughout the station, and an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:24.000
infected lady sneaks onboard just as the doors&nbsp;
close, undiscovered. She rapidly transforms into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.720
a zombie, attacks an attendant, and many of the&nbsp;
personnel and passengers become zombies as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.280
The surviving passengers take refuge in&nbsp;
the train's front and rear carriages,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.800
noticing that the infected zombies will&nbsp;
only attack if they can see or hear them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.040
but they will not be able to open the doors.&nbsp;

The train comes to a halt at Daejeon Station,&nbsp;
which is allegedly guarded by the South Korean&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:00.560
Army. The passengers exit into a deserted station,&nbsp;
only to discover that the troops have turned into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.680
zombies, who assault the group. As they rush&nbsp;
back to the train, many passengers are assaulted&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.520
and murdered, but the majority of those who&nbsp;
survive board the front carriages safely.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:15.120
Su-an, Seong-kyeong, In-gil, and the homeless&nbsp;
guy are trapped between two zombie-infested&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.720
automobiles and take refuge in the toilets.&nbsp;

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:30.240
are murdered and infected during the escape and&nbsp;
wind up in the back carriages. After discovering&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.080
that Busan has been declared a quarantine&nbsp;
zone, the captain guides the train there.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.640
Seok-gang woo's exploits the darkness of the&nbsp;
tunnels along the road to cross through the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.680
zombie-infested cars and rescue their loved ones.&nbsp;
The gang continues to move towards the front&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.240
automobiles that are secure, but accidentally&nbsp;
notifies the zombies in the final car before the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:53.600
safe one. While Seok-woo and Sang-hwa stay behind&nbsp;
to keep the doors shut while the others flee,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.760
Yon-suk has persuaded Ki-chul and the other&nbsp;
passengers that they are potentially sick and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.960
should not assist. Sang-hwa gives up his life&nbsp;
to allow Seok-woo to get the others to safety.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.400

Yon-suk and Ki-chul take the other passengers&nbsp;
in the front vehicles into a closed vestibule,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:17.200
assuming Seok-group woo's is infected. The&nbsp;
passengers' selfishness has disturbed Jong-gil,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.600
who allows the zombies into the front car,&nbsp;
murdering the other survivors, but Yon-suk&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.960
and Ki-chul manage to flee into a toilet. Due to a&nbsp;
blocked track, the train is forced to halt at East&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:32.880
Daegu railway station, forcing the survivors to&nbsp;
seek a different train. Yon-suk drives Ki-chul,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.880
Jin-hee, and the captain into a group&nbsp;
of zombies on his way out, but Yong-guk&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:42.400
waits with Jin-hee until she reanimates and&nbsp;
kills him. Seok-woo, Su-an, Seong-kyeong,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.880
and the homeless man are trapped under a railroad&nbsp;
car due to an out-of-control train. While the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.680
others escape via a tiny hole and discover a&nbsp;
functioning train, the homeless guy sacrifices&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.160
himself to keep back a zombie horde. They are&nbsp;
on their way to Busan after freeing a train&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:01.040
from a swarm of zombies holding it back, when&nbsp;
a zombified Yon-suk assaults Seok-woo and bites&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:06.000
him before Seok-woo can toss him from the engine.&nbsp;
Knowing he'll be turned, he hurriedly instructs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.320
Seong-kyeong how to operate the train and bids his&nbsp;
daughter farewell before leaping off the train.

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.120
Seong-kyeong and Su-an are forced to walk&nbsp;
as a tunnel is closed just before Busan.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.920
Military snipers ready to shoot at the&nbsp;
tunnel's exit until Su-an sobs and sings&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:24.640
'Aloha 'Oe.' They then discover the duo is&nbsp;
human and assist them in getting to safety.
