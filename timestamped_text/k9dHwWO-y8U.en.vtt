so yeah it's gonna be another one of
 

00:12:57.440 --> 00:12:59.350 align:start position:0%
so yeah it's gonna be another one of
those<00:12:58.160><c> as</c><00:12:58.399><c> i</c><00:12:58.560><c> said</c><00:12:58.800><c> earlier</c>

00:12:59.350 --> 00:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
those as i said earlier
 

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:01.190 align:start position:0%
those as i said earlier
i'm<00:12:59.600><c> not</c><00:12:59.839><c> sure</c><00:13:00.079><c> if</c><00:13:00.240><c> the</c><00:13:00.399><c> character</c><00:13:00.800><c> is</c><00:13:00.959><c> still</c>

00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:01.200 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if the character is still
 

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:02.949 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if the character is still
around<00:13:01.920><c> and</c><00:13:02.160><c> do</c><00:13:02.240><c> you</c><00:13:02.320><c> think</c><00:13:02.480><c> that</c><00:13:02.720><c> their</c>

00:13:02.949 --> 00:13:02.959 align:start position:0%
around and do you think that their
 

00:13:02.959 --> 00:13:04.629 align:start position:0%
around and do you think that their
daughter<00:13:03.279><c> diana</c><00:13:03.920><c> may</c><00:13:04.079><c> be</c><00:13:04.240><c> the</c><00:13:04.399><c> one</c>

00:13:04.629 --> 00:13:04.639 align:start position:0%
daughter diana may be the one
 

00:13:04.639 --> 00:13:06.310 align:start position:0%
daughter diana may be the one
controlling<00:13:05.200><c> all</c><00:13:05.279><c> the</c><00:13:05.440><c> time</c><00:13:05.680><c> jumps</c>

00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:06.320 align:start position:0%
controlling all the time jumps
 

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:08.790 align:start position:0%
controlling all the time jumps
however<00:13:06.800><c> if</c><00:13:06.959><c> fitz</c><00:13:07.279><c> is</c><00:13:07.440><c> alive</c><00:13:07.839><c> then</c><00:13:08.320><c> he'll</c><00:13:08.639><c> no</c>

00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:08.800 align:start position:0%
however if fitz is alive then he'll no
 

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:10.710 align:start position:0%
however if fitz is alive then he'll no
doubt<00:13:09.040><c> be</c><00:13:09.279><c> even</c><00:13:09.600><c> more</c><00:13:09.839><c> angered</c><00:13:10.240><c> that</c><00:13:10.399><c> malik</c>

00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:10.720 align:start position:0%
doubt be even more angered that malik
 

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:12.629 align:start position:0%
doubt be even more angered that malik
and<00:13:10.880><c> co</c><00:13:11.120><c> have</c><00:13:11.279><c> kidnapped</c><00:13:11.839><c> simmons</c>

00:13:12.629 --> 00:13:12.639 align:start position:0%
and co have kidnapped simmons
 

00:13:12.639 --> 00:13:14.310 align:start position:0%
and co have kidnapped simmons
so<00:13:12.880><c> will</c><00:13:13.040><c> likely</c><00:13:13.360><c> be</c><00:13:13.519><c> coming</c><00:13:13.760><c> after</c><00:13:14.000><c> them</c><00:13:14.240><c> in</c>

00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:14.320 align:start position:0%
so will likely be coming after them in
 

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:16.949 align:start position:0%
so will likely be coming after them in
full<00:13:14.560><c> force</c><00:13:15.120><c> in</c><00:13:15.360><c> order</c><00:13:15.600><c> to</c><00:13:15.760><c> rescue</c><00:13:16.160><c> his</c><00:13:16.399><c> wife</c>
