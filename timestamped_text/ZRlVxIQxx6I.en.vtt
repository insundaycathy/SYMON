00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.550
Welcome to Cinema Summary, ladies and gentlemen
and get ready to travel through time and save

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:42.760
the future as we take a look back at the original
scifi film that started a legendary franchise.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.620
This is The Terminator.

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.640
In the distant future of 2029 AD Los Angeles
looks a lot like Detroit.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.880
In this ruined world, machines had conquered
and crushed humanity beneath steel and laser

00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:00.089
beams and at the zenith of their defeat they
had one final trick to pull and so humanity

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:08.010
has one last ditch effort to save our species
from total annihilation before it ever begins.

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.860
In 1984, 1:52 AM, things go a little crazy.

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.840
As electricity courses through the air, a
naked man appears out of nowhere.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.210
This hulking man takes steps to observe the
LA skyline before he runs into some nearby

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.000
punks and demands that they give him their
clothes.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.909
They attack him but he kills 2 of them with
his bare hands so the last guy standing eagerly

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.570
hands over his clothes.

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.880
But Somewhere else in the city, a similar
phenomenon occurs and a different naked and

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.789
scruffy looking guy appears.

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:42.569
Hurt and a little injured, the scruffy man
takes a homeless guy’s pants before running

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:47.950
from the cops although he manages to ambush
one and asks what year it is before running

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.509
off into a store after stealing a cop’s
gun and puts on a pair of shoes and a coat

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:53.789
for himself.

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:57.599
All the while hiding from the cops and after
sneaking around, getting out of the store

00:01:57.599 --> 00:02:01.140
and stealing a shotgun from a cruiser he walks
away.

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.950
Looking like any other person on an LA sidewalk,
just headed for a phonebooth to look at a

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.690
phone book for the name: Sarah Connor.

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:10.690
Who is she?

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.170
Well, she’s this young lady working as a
waitress, overworked, flustered, and going

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.220
through a tough time.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.700
More on her later as we see that the big dude
from earlier goes to a gun shop and steals

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.040
some guns and ammo.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.610
At the same time the scruffy man from earlier
saws off the stock of his shotgun and begins

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:27.610
his search for Sarah.

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.860
Now that he’s locked and loaded, the big
guy then goes through a phone book and also

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.830
searches for Sarah Connor.

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.440
Finding a Sarah Connor at an address which
he goes to and after knocking on the door

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.440
and meeting Sarah Connor he pulls out a gun
and kills her.

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:40.440
Sometime after this, ‘our’ Sarah Connor
watches a TV newscast about the murder.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.170
While the other guy sits in a car and remembers
the future.

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:49.130
Humans trapped like rats, crawling beneath
rubble, running and hiding from killer robots.

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.959
Doing everything in their power to kill another
machine and make it through the day.

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:57.940
His dream ends and he wakes up, driving off
in the LA night streets.

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.700
Off to find Sarah
Who gets ready for a night out in the town

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.189
and drives on her bike, unaware she’s being
followed by the scruffy man from the future.

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:09.599
At the same time the police get to talking
about a series of deaths all involving victims

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:14.129
named “Sarah Connor” and now are trying
to get in touch with Sarah back at her home

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:17.579
but since they can’t get in touch they’ll
try a different method.

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:20.609
So as Sarah has dinner by herself, she finds
out from a newscast about 2 murdered women

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:21.800
by the name of Sarah Connor.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:25.430
Concerned, she heads to a pay phone and checks
the phone book (seeing her name there) tries

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.670
to make a call but the phone’s out of order.

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.310
So she leaves the bistro and heads into a
club called Tech Noir followed by the scruffy

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.959
haired guy from earlier who she spots passing
by.

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:40.770
She goes in to the back of the club to call
the police but the lines are busy.

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:45.109
Which does not bode well as the Sarah Connor
Killer heads to Sarah’s apartment and kills

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:48.879
Sarah’s room mate and her boyfriend with
extreme prejudice.

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:53.190
Who hears a voice message left by Sarah on
their answering machine which lists the address

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.700
of Tech Noir.

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:02.489
Sarah then finally manages to get on call
with the police about the scruffy guy and

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:06.579
waits for them to send a squad car over as
the killer enters and begins making his way

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:07.810
into the club.

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.790
At the same time, Sarah makes eye contact
with the scruffy guy from earlier just as

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:18.620
the killer identifies Sarah and points his
gun only to get blasted by the scruffy man

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:19.620
and his shotgun.

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:20.620
Leaving him stunned.

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.389
A shootout occurs between the killer and the
shotgunner but ultimately the scruffy time

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:25.840
traveller rescues Sarah and takes her away.

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:31.420
Running from the killer, and after getting
into a car, they narrowly escape though the

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.800
Killer chases after them in a police car.

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:38.100
We then find out more about the scruffy man:
his name is Kyle Reese.

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:43.250
A soldier from the future sent to protect
Sarah from being terminated by the killer

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:44.250
robot-cyborg.

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:52.759
An infiltration unit with a flesh and blood
exterior known as a Terminator.

00:04:52.759 --> 00:05:00.690
It’s a revelation that Sarah takes well
enough and believes given what she has seen.

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:03.889
Kyle and Sarah ditch the car and get into
a different one, hiding from the police in

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:12.180
a car park where Kyle talks more about the
future: a world torn by nuclear war where

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:22.940
an intelligent machine used for military defense
got so smart that it saw humans as a threat.

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:32.150
It’s a bleak future where humans were hunted,
enslaved in camps, and starved, but one man

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:34.210
gave them hope: John Connor.

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:40.340
The son of Sarah who is yet to be born.

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:44.250
As Kyle gets ready to drive out of the parking
lot, the terminator finds them and tries to

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:49.400
terminate Sarah in a high speed chase that
ends with the terminator crashing the car

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:53.490
and Kyle and Sarah getting picked up by the
cops thought the Terminator is missing.

00:05:53.490 --> 00:06:02.120
At the station, Sarah is shook up and the
detectives try to reassure her as much as

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:03.120
they can about tonight’s event.

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:07.830
Hell they even have a shrink here to help
figure out if Kyle Reese is crazy.

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:11.919
Meanwhile inside an apartment, the Terminator
conducts field repairs on itself.

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:17.210
Revealing biological flesh over a metal endoskeleton.

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:20.810
The police question Kyle who tells them all
about the future to their utter disbelief

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:22.539
and delight.

00:06:22.539 --> 00:06:25.710
While at the same time, the Terminator prepares
itself.

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:29.590
As the detectives, watch the questioning,
they convince Sarah that Kyle is crazy and

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:32.840
that the Terminator was just some dude who
was high and wearing body armor.

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:34.449
He ain’t coming for her.

00:06:34.449 --> 00:06:41.040
As the shrink leaves the building, the Terminator
enters the station and asks politely to see

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:49.400
Sarah Connor before deciding to come back
later in his car.

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:54.860
Then he goes on a cold hearted rampage through
the station, taking on the 30 cops inside

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:57.410
who can’t stop the mechanical monster.

00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:01.100
Especially after it knocks out the power in
the building at the same time, that Kyle gets

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:04.199
himself out of handcuffs and goes to rescue
Sarah.

00:07:04.199 --> 00:07:07.830
Who together, manage to hustle and get out
of there leaving behind: A trail of destruction.

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:13.940
They stop at the side of the road and ditch
the car after grabbing a few things and settle

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:19.160
down near a ditch where Sarah does some impromptu
first aid on Kyle’s bullet wound he got

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:20.319
earlier.

00:07:20.319 --> 00:07:24.990
And to distract her as she works, Kyle tells
Sarah a little bit about her son, John but

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:27.430
can’t tell her who the father is.

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:32.219
But he can talk about why he traveled through
time: he wanted to meet the legendary Sarah

00:07:32.219 --> 00:07:39.070
Connor who would teach John everything he
knew about leading, fighting, and surviving.

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:45.569
Something that Sarah has a hard time embracing
or wanting since she’s normal but she settles

00:07:45.569 --> 00:07:48.949
in for the night hiding from the Terminator
as Kyle tells her about the future.

00:07:48.949 --> 00:07:54.139
And we get a deeper look of what life is like
for humans aside from fighting: dirty, hiding

00:07:54.139 --> 00:07:58.100
like rats, finding whatever comfort whereever
humans can.

00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:03.820
As for Kyle, he finds comfort in a photo of
Sarah Connor seated in a car next to a dog.

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:08.520
But his rest is interrupted by the arrival
of a Terminator who like a demon slaughters

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:10.539
the humans without remorse.

00:08:10.539 --> 00:08:14.280
The next day, the Terminator whose flesh is
rotting discovers in a diary the location

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:16.930
of a cabin where Sarah’s mom lives.

00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:21.599
Kyle and Sarah book a motel room with a kitchen
where Kyle goes out for supplies as Sarah

00:08:21.599 --> 00:08:22.749
stays behind.

00:08:22.749 --> 00:08:26.870
Later, she gets a call from her mom who is
actually the Terminator impersonating her

00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:31.819
mom who finds out the location of the motel
and is on his way there.

00:08:31.819 --> 00:08:37.340
That night, Kyle and Sarah make pipe bombs
using a variety of materials and Sarah begins

00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:44.770
to really comprehend just how messed up her
life has become and they begin talking about

00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:53.220
feelings and about love and Kyle confesses
that he fell in love with her in the future

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:59.230
and coming back in time wasn’t just to meet
a legend but the woman he loves.

00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:03.840
Before packing the pipe bombs awkwardly, he
shouldn’t have mentioned it, but Sarah doesn’t

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:05.350
seem to mind.

00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:07.090
And one thing leads to another.

00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:12.630
After some love making they prepare to leave
when they hear the barking of dogs.

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:14.070
The Terminator is near!

00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:19.130
So they quickly, steal a pickup and drive
away with the killer cyborg in hot pursuit.

00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:22.850
As they go through a service tunnel, Kyle
lights a few the pipe bombs before chucking

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:27.410
them and just as he’s about to throw one
of them, he gets shot by the Terminator and

00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:28.680
drops the bomb.

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:33.680
This leads to Sarah crashing and The Terminator
hijacking a nearby tank truck, now walking

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:34.680
with a limp.

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:39.959
And Sarah only narrowly managed to drag Kyle
from the pickup before it is crushed by the

00:09:39.959 --> 00:09:40.959
Terminator in the tanker.

00:09:40.959 --> 00:09:44.840
They continue running and with some quick
thinking, Kyle lights a pipe bomb and shoves

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:49.720
it in the exhaust of the Terminator’s truck
causing the vehicle to explode and Sarah watches

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:51.680
as it dies in the flames.

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:53.620
She can finally relax.

00:09:53.620 --> 00:10:01.000
She tiredly heads over to wreckage along with
Kyle and they embrace only for The Terminator

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.190
to get right back up and chase them.

00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:08.500
They run into a metalworks foundry where Kyle
turns on some machinery and Sarah manages

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:12.780
to drag him deeper into the factory just in
time as the terminator has caught up with

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:13.780
them.

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:18.990
As Sarah and Kyle sneak around, Sarah accidentally
activates a pneumatic press alerting the Terminator

00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:24.020
who finds them so Kyle bravely but futility
beats it off with a stick and sticks a pipe

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:25.560
bomb into its torso.

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:28.440
Blowing it to smithereens.

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:35.130
The Terminator’s finally dead but Sarah’s
leg got hit with shrapnel so she’s stuck

00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:40.040
crawling around the foundry’s floor but
the nightmare isn’t over as the Terminator,

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:46.449
now just a torso with a head and arms is still
going after her.

00:10:46.449 --> 00:10:51.660
So she crawls onto a conveyor belt and through
the floor of a particular piece of machinery.

00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:54.410
Making it to the other side where she presses
a button.

00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:57.980
Crushing the killer robot under the force
of a hydraulic press.

00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:02.680
It’s demonic red eyes finally going dark.

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:09.589
Afterwards, Kyle is taken away in a body bag
as Sarah is rushed to a hospital.

00:11:09.589 --> 00:11:13.750
Fast forward months later where Sarah is driving
through Mexico and makes tape recordings for

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:15.850
John to listen to in the future.

00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:24.720
And while at a gas station, a little kid takes
a photo of her (the same photo Reese had)

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:30.980
and she buys it off the kid and drives off
towards a dark future.

00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:38.630
And that was The Terminator, an absolute gold
star classic that if you’re into scifi,

00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:42.180
you should totally watch it and with that
being said!

00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:45.130
