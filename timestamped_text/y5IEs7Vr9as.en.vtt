00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.640
Welcome back to Movie Recaps. Today i&nbsp;
will show you a sci-fi horror film called&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:11.360
Splice. Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.
Two scientists, Clive Nicoli and Elsa Kast,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.680
are experts in the field of genetic engineering&nbsp;
that work for a company called Newstead.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.760
The company conducts various experiments&nbsp;
that focus on splicing DNA of different&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.600
animals in order to produce new life forms&nbsp;
that would be used for medicinal use.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.960
After many failed attempts, Clive and Elsa&nbsp;
finally manage to succeed in their mission. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.240
duo watches their creations in awe and decides to&nbsp;
name the two grotesque creatures Fred and Ginger.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:39.440
The two organisms were meant to be used to produce&nbsp;
medicinal proteins for livestock. Upon seeing the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.320
amazing results and possible opportunities their&nbsp;
experiment holds, Clive and Elsa predict that they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.200
can use the same splicing technique they used&nbsp;
for Fred on humans. The two scientists predict&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.760
that if applied correctly, the technique could be&nbsp;
the miracle cure for numerous currently incurable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.560
diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's&nbsp;
disease. Their idea didn’t get the green light&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:03.360
from their employers, Joan Chorot and William&nbsp;
Barlow, who strictly forbade the young scientists&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:08.560
to conduct human experimentation, as that could&nbsp;
potentially lead to bad publicity for the company.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:14.080
Clive and Elsa decide to undergo their experiments&nbsp;
in secret. After a few unsuccessful attempts,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.680
the two manage to create a successful human slash&nbsp;
animal splice. Excited by their scientific break&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.160
trough, Elsa decides to take the genetic material&nbsp;
to the birthing room in order to start the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:29.280
development of their creation. Clive is opposed&nbsp;
to the idea, but Elsa is keen on continuing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.080
the experiment since it could potentially be a&nbsp;
solution to many human diseases. She convinces&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.240
Clive by telling him not to worry as they’re going&nbsp;
to destroy the creature before it reaches full&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.520
term, so nobody will ever know. Clive starts the&nbsp;
machine and the conception sequence is started.&nbsp;

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.960
Later, Clive is talking to one&nbsp;
of his colleagues. The young man&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:52.000
asks what are he and Elsa working on, but&nbsp;
Clive manages to dodge the question. Meanwhile,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.120
Elsa can be seen examining the incubator. When the&nbsp;
heartbeat of the creature suddenly falls quiet,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.120
she instantly becomes worried, but is quickly&nbsp;
relieved as the heartbeat appears again.&nbsp;

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.480
After finishing work, Elsa and Clive are lounging&nbsp;
in their apartment, talking about moving to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:11.360
a bigger apartment. The conversation continues&nbsp;
and the two get to the topic about having kids,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.760
which makes Elsa visibly nervous. Their&nbsp;
conversation is interrupted by an alarm on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:21.520
Clive’s phone. They rush to the lab immediately.
Turns out that the fetus is ready to come out,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.000
despite being months away from its planned&nbsp;
birth. Clive’s and Elsa’s attempts to fix&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.560
the machine and stop the creature from being born&nbsp;
are unsuccessful, and Elsa injures her hand in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.920
process. The creature is born, and before it can&nbsp;
escape and do any more damage, Clive manages to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:41.280
trap it under a plastic container. He goes to help&nbsp;
Elsa, who is convulsing and losing consciousness&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.920
due to her wound, which is likely infected by&nbsp;
the creature’s poison. Clive injects her with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:51.040
some medicine, and she goes back to normal.
Elsa and Clive return to their apartment.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.440
The birth deeply shakes both Clive and Elsa,&nbsp;
with Clive expressing that they should destroy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.240
their creation. Elsa tells Clive that there’s&nbsp;
still a lot they can learn from this situation,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.960
but Clive is set on destroying the creature.&nbsp;
Soon, the both of them head to the lab to kill&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.040
the creature, only to find what appears&nbsp;
to be a dead body in the incubator.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:14.160
Upon further examination, Elsa notices that while&nbsp;
there is a bunch of dead tissue in the incubator,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.960
the entire body of the creature is missing.&nbsp;
Almost immediately, she hears small,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:23.840
fast footsteps coming towards her. She is met with&nbsp;
a small, chicken-like creature that imprints on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.880
her. Elsa and Clive manage to knock the creature&nbsp;
out and begin to study it, only to find out that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:34.080
it can excrete venom, even though there was no&nbsp;
predatory gene in its DNA. As the creature's life&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.880
continues, it’s revealed that the creature&nbsp;
is aging rapidly due to its defective DNA.&nbsp;

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.280
Later that night, Clive meets with Barlow who&nbsp;
informs him that if they can’t sell the medicinal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.920
proteins from Ginger and Fred, Newstead is going&nbsp;
to be in big trouble, and Clive and Elsa would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:53.520
be to blame. A month passes and the creature has&nbsp;
grown to be very large. Based on the way it acts,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:58.400
it can be concluded that it possesses a human&nbsp;
toddler level of intelligence. Elsa forms a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.880
bond with the creature, treating it more like a&nbsp;
child than a science experiment, much to Clive's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.600
worry. She goes as far as letting the creature&nbsp;
out of its containment area and taking the cover&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:12.000
off its stinger. After the creature spells&nbsp;
NERD out of toys after it sees the company’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.640
name on Elsa’s shirt, Elsa decided to name the&nbsp;
creature Dren, which is NERD spelled backwards.&nbsp;

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:22.080
Elsa’s treatment of Dren leads to an&nbsp;
argument between Elsa and Clive. Apparently,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:26.560
their experiment is in trouble of getting&nbsp;
uncovered, since their lab is set to be renovated,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.520
which opens a possibility for someone to see their&nbsp;
forbidden experiment. That’s when Gavin, Clive’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.480
brother in the lab and fellow college, sneaks into&nbsp;
the room to eaves trope on their conversation, but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:42.800
unexpectedly runs into Dren. Terrified, he quickly&nbsp;
flees the scene. In order to keep Dren a secret,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.680
Clive and Elsa decide to sneak Dren out in a card&nbsp;
box and hide her in a storage area, away from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:53.920
prying eyes. To their dismay, Dren has a really&nbsp;
high fever, which greatly worries Elsa. Elsa&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:58.800
and Clive quickly put Dren in a cold water bath&nbsp;
in order to soothe her fever. When Clive holds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:04.320
Dren underwater, it is revealed that the creature&nbsp;
developed dubious lungs. That night, Elsa takes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.480
care of Dren, giving it a Barbie doll which she&nbsp;
had to hide from her mother when she was a child.&nbsp;

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:14.080
As time went on, Dren has grown to be&nbsp;
significantly larger, with a more human, womanly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:19.360
appearance. As Elsa and Clive fool around and end&nbsp;
up having intercourse on the couch, Dren can be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:24.480
seen secretly watching them from the next room.
The next day, Clive and Elsa present their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:30.240
original hybrid creations, Fred and Ginger,&nbsp;
to the public. Unfortunately, the presentation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:35.360
goes horribly wrong, as the two creatures turn&nbsp;
extremely violent and fight each other to death.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:40.240
After examining the situation, Clive and Elsa&nbsp;
found out that Ginger transformed into a male.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:45.520
The reason as to why she did so remained&nbsp;
unknown. Elsa and Clive decide to move Dren&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:50.880
into an old farmhouse Elsa’s mother once owned.&nbsp;
When they get to the farm, Dren runs off to find&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:55.840
some food. After setting up Dren’s room in the&nbsp;
barn, Elsa and Clive proceed to the farmhouse.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:01.200
Upon opening the door, they’re met with a filthy&nbsp;
room with a bed, a single chair and a bucket,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:05.200
which indicates that Elsa lived in an&nbsp;
abusive environment when she was younger.&nbsp;

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:10.080
Meanwhile, Dren is not satisfied with her life&nbsp;
on the farm. With her creators gone from work&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:15.360
all the time and only a cat to keep her company,&nbsp;
Dren becomes rebellious, which Clive takes well,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:21.120
in contrast to Elsa, who is deeply disturbed by&nbsp;
it. In order to keep Dren at bay, Elsa decides to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:26.480
stay at home and keep Dren company. To make Dren&nbsp;
happy, Elsa showers her in make-up and jewelry,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:31.760
which Elsa’s mother strictly forbade when Elsa&nbsp;
was a child. When Elsa checks the makeup table,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:37.040
she finds numerous drawings of Clive, but not a&nbsp;
single one of her. Dren grows nervous at Elsa’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:41.680
find and runs away to her cat, which Elsa takes&nbsp;
away, telling Dren she can't get everything she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:47.200
wants, which is a part of growing up. When Clive&nbsp;
arrives home he finds Dren sad, and tries to cheer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:52.160
her up by turning on some music and dancing with&nbsp;
her. While dancing, Clive felt forbidden feelings&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:56.640
towards Dren and soon comes to the realization&nbsp;
that Elsa used parts of her DNA whilst they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:02.880
were creating Dren. He goes to confront Elsa, the&nbsp;
two clash and Clive leaves. After Clive is gone,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:07.840
Elsa decides to give Dren back the cat she&nbsp;
previously took away, but Dren kills it, causing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:13.440
Elsa to slap Dren across the face. Dren pounced at&nbsp;
Elsa so she could steal the barn keys to escape,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:18.480
but is knocked out and strapped to an operating&nbsp;
table. Elsa begins to take off Dren’s jewelry and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:23.280
clothes, and due to her violent behavior,&nbsp;
removes her stinger. When Clive arrives,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:27.600
Elsa takes the stinger back to the lab to find&nbsp;
the proteins and synthesize them for her work.&nbsp;

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:33.760
The next day, Clive goes to the farm to find&nbsp;
Elsa but is met by Dren, who tries to seduce him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:38.640
Clive initially declines, but ultimately succumbs&nbsp;
to Dren’s advances and the two have intercourse.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:44.320
During the act, it can be seen that Dren has&nbsp;
regenerated her previously amputated stinger.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:49.440
To Clive’s horror, Elsa walks in on them and&nbsp;
runs away in disgust. Clive runs to her, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:53.360
both of them enter their car and drive to their&nbsp;
old apartment, where they have an argument about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:58.720
Elsa’s views on Dren. It is revealed that Elsa&nbsp;
wanted to create a child, instead of traditionally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:03.280
having a child because she desperately wanted&nbsp;
to have control over the said child, a need that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:08.160
probably stems from her abusive childhood. When&nbsp;
they finished their argument, the two come back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:13.440
to the farmhouse, only to find Dren dead in her&nbsp;
bed. They bury Dren’s body and burn her clothes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.200
Whilst moving Dren’s things, Elsa finds Dren’s&nbsp;
drawings of herself. That’s where Gavin and Barlow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:24.320
arrive, having found out about Elsa’s and Clive’s&nbsp;
secret. Before they can engage in conversation,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:30.400
Dren suddenly appears, now looking more masculine,&nbsp;
indicating that Dren too, like Ginger, transformed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:36.320
into the opposite gender. Dren becomes aggressive,&nbsp;
killing Barlow and Gavin, and pouncing on Clive.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:40.800
Elsa manages to run away into the woods but&nbsp;
doesn't get very far, as Dren catches up with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:45.840
her quickly. Dren pounces on Elsa and presses her&nbsp;
to the ground and forces intercourse with her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:51.120
but is stopped by Clive, who impales Dren&nbsp;
with a branch from behind. Dren attacks Clive,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:55.200
which leads to Elsa bashing a rock on Dren’s&nbsp;
head, killing the creature once and for all.&nbsp;

00:08:55.920 --> 00:09:00.480
In the aftermath of all this, Elsa is still a&nbsp;
Newstead employee and has been granted permission&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:05.440
to continue her research into proteins that&nbsp;
were present in Dren’s body. When she stands up,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:09.680
she is visibly pregnant, which hints at the&nbsp;
possibility that she is carrying Dren’s child.
