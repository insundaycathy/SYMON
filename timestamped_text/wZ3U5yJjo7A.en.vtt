blocked it for two reasons
 

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:57.589 align:start position:0%
blocked it for two reasons
firstly<00:03:55.920><c> to</c><00:03:56.159><c> lock</c><00:03:56.400><c> in</c><00:03:56.480><c> the</c><00:03:56.560><c> subject</c><00:03:57.040><c> of</c><00:03:57.120><c> course</c>

firstly to lock in the subject of course
 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:59.190 align:start position:0%
firstly to lock in the subject of course
and<00:03:57.760><c> secondly</c><00:03:58.239><c> to</c><00:03:58.400><c> make</c><00:03:58.560><c> sure</c><00:03:58.799><c> to</c><00:03:58.959><c> know</c>

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 align:start position:0%
and secondly to make sure to know
 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.190 align:start position:0%
and secondly to make sure to know

exactly when the sleeping gas has failed
 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.110 align:start position:0%
exactly when the sleeping gas has failed
and<00:04:01.360><c> the</c><00:04:01.519><c> subject</c><00:04:01.920><c> tries</c><00:04:02.159><c> to</c><00:04:02.239><c> break</c><00:04:02.480><c> out</c><00:04:02.879><c> then</c>

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 align:start position:0%
and the subject tries to break out then
 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.390 align:start position:0%
and the subject tries to break out then
i<00:04:03.200><c> would</c><00:04:03.360><c> have</c><00:04:03.439><c> guarded</c><00:04:03.760><c> the</c><00:04:03.920><c> room</c>

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 align:start position:0%
i would have guarded the room
 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.750 align:start position:0%
i would have guarded the room
by<00:04:04.560><c> staying</c><00:04:04.879><c> on</c><00:04:04.959><c> the</c><00:04:05.120><c> other</c><00:04:05.360><c> side</c><00:04:05.519><c> of</c><00:04:05.599><c> the</c>

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
by staying on the other side of the
 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.990 align:start position:0%
by staying on the other side of the

corridor fixating the locked room
 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.750 align:start position:0%

so<00:04:08.159><c> if</c><00:04:08.319><c> anything</c><00:04:08.640><c> should</c><00:04:08.879><c> happen</c><00:04:09.280><c> i</c><00:04:09.360><c> will</c><00:04:09.519><c> know</c>

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 align:start position:0%
so if anything should happen i will know
 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.509 align:start position:0%
so if anything should happen i will know

this lets us be much more safe and
