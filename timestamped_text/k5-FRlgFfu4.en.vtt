00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:09.760
now in this video we will recap the&nbsp;
story of jenny and her father Jeff&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:15.280
we started out with jenny having a blast calling&nbsp;
up evil spirits with her adorable puppets she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.960
seems to have a vivid imagination this girl that&nbsp;
is probably because her dad is a cartoon artist&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:26.400
talented in drawing creepy puppets and the likes&nbsp;
while jenny is playing in the attic her father&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.520
Jeff is having a good time with the babysitter&nbsp;
Samantha a loud bang sounds from above but the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:37.360
two adults don't seem to care however shortly&nbsp;
after another bang halls down Maggie her mother&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:43.040
and Jeff's wife just got home and heard the noise&nbsp;
as well she storms up to have a look and Jeff&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:49.440
for once too gets up and seems to suddenly care&nbsp;
he seems to be a little bit lazy dude now in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.000
next scene we can see that the relationship&nbsp;
between Jeff and Maggie isn't the healthy one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.600
they argue blaming each other and really go&nbsp;
all out all in front of the poor little girl&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:05.040
she is seemingly annoyed by her parents fighting&nbsp;
and who wouldn't really right why in front of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.400
kid now Maggie drives her daughter to the hospital&nbsp;
and leaves Jeff back we get to know that she seems&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.440
to be a very successful employee while Jeff is&nbsp;
an unemployed artist that hasn't seen a job in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:21.120
over three years i suppose her frustration can&nbsp;
be understood on the other hand we hear that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:26.240
she seems to work almost every day and barely&nbsp;
gets to see her daughter it is clear that both&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.280
of them are very dissatisfied with each other&nbsp;
and their daughter is the victim of the feud&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:37.360
a few days pass and we cut to a divorce hearing in&nbsp;
front of a family court looks like these problems&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.800
weren't new ones huh now Maggie demands sole&nbsp;
custody of their daughter which by all means&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.840
seems to be a little bit harsh Jeff hasn't&nbsp;
got a job and seems to be irresponsible but he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.480
shows a great deal of heart and empathy with his&nbsp;
daughter however that doesn't stop Maggie and her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:57.920
father to crush down on jeff in this hearing an&nbsp;
intense argument breaks out and unfortunately&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:05.200
can be heard by jenny sitting outside once again&nbsp;
a stupid and unnecessary move by the adults here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.760
after coming home jeff does with every&nbsp;
insecure dude would do in his position&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:15.600
wallowing in self-pity watching old family videos&nbsp;
while at the same time stuffing down junk food&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:22.320
we can see this guy is not a dangerous man the&nbsp;
next day jenny and her dad go for some lunch&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:28.720
at the local cafe now we can see how much joy she&nbsp;
receives from her dad's talent as a cartoon artist&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:34.000
he seems to love her very much but seems to be&nbsp;
easily distracted when he meets an old friend who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.520
he went to school with he isn't able to balance&nbsp;
between him and his daughter which causes her to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:45.200
disappear annoyed on the other hand the guy that&nbsp;
he meets runs a comic business and invites him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.840
to discuss the possibilities of an inking&nbsp;
job good job jeff way to go in my opinion&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.360
now at the same time though his soon-to-be&nbsp;
ex-wife calls and causes a scene because he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.960
went out with her daughter as she puts it that's&nbsp;
shameless if you ask me but understandable if he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:07.280
was a dangerous guy but this guy's threat level&nbsp;
isn't over the one of a potato okay and i'm not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:13.680
talking about a hot one here he has generally a&nbsp;
good heart so both argue back and forth until this

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:24.000
happens now the mother is gone and we find&nbsp;
ourselves back at the funeral service at their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.760
home the mood is generically dimmed until jenny&nbsp;
decides to paint the walls with tomato juice i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.960
guess she's an artist as well her father tries to&nbsp;
stop her but looks more like a clueless teenager&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:41.280
facing his accident perhaps his late ex-wife had a&nbsp;
point this weird scene is followed by another one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.840
jeff pulls a very bad speech while those around&nbsp;
him fake their interest in what he has to say&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.560
at the same time the painting in the back&nbsp;
magically catches fire but instead of doing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:56.560
something against it he just stares at it luckily&nbsp;
samantha the babysitter comes for help now this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.280
doesn't seem like a natural distortion does&nbsp;
it looks like the haunting is about to start&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:07.440
the guests have left and jenny is already sleeping&nbsp;
and jeff goes for a nap as well he is exhausted&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:12.800
but then he hears a sound and wakes up as he&nbsp;
leaves the room to check he witnesses the door&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:18.400
to the attic opening itself up being worried about&nbsp;
his daughter he decides to have a look but before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:24.080
he arrives a creepy white black stripped clown&nbsp;
climbs through it now jeff is freaked out he backs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:30.560
off falls onto his butt and freezes in terror&nbsp;
the interesting thing it is one of his drawings&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:37.440
was it just a dream well we will find out the next&nbsp;
day two things happen maggie's father pays our&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.960
house a visit he is determined to take away jenny&nbsp;
because apparently it was his daughter's last wish&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:48.160
before she died which is ridiculous says he&nbsp;
has no connection whatsoever with little jenny&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:53.360
it seems like he only wants her because that's&nbsp;
what is now the sea's daughter wanted jeff on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:58.960
other hand for once is determined to not back&nbsp;
down good for him knowing he has to change to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.760
stand a chance against his ex-wife's rich father&nbsp;
he makes his way to the comic book business owner&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:10.160
and proposes himself as a new employee conor the&nbsp;
owner of the business agrees and jeff as of now is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:15.840
back in the game at home he starts putting down&nbsp;
some sketches he is completely immersed until&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:22.480
he loses control and falls into a trance state he&nbsp;
rapidly scribbles a dark figure over his sketches&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:27.920
when he awakes from it he realizes that something&nbsp;
isn't right but before he could pick up the phone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:33.680
and call his local therapist his daughter comes&nbsp;
in and tells him about the monster in her room&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:40.080
great timing in her room she comes clean she&nbsp;
tells him that she's very sad and misses her mom&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:49.120
to which jeff replies this yeah me i'm sad too but&nbsp;
you know what it's okay to be sad honey that's a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:54.320
beautiful sentence jeff might be a lazy dreamer&nbsp;
but he sure carries his heart in the right place&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:59.280
now when he has his new job meeting he hands&nbsp;
out his sketches but in between them the black&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:04.800
scribble he has made during trance is still&nbsp;
there he forgot to take it out but his new boss&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:08.560
completely falls in love with it to&nbsp;
understand that you must know that his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:14.480
new boss is a strange guy that is possessed with&nbsp;
the idea of a comic book about darkness itself&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:20.080
and the drawing jeff has made is exactly what he&nbsp;
wants be it as it is it doesn't matter jeff is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:24.560
happy that he has found a new job it isn't&nbsp;
what he dreamt of but it is enough to take&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:33.840
care of his daughter for the time being that is&nbsp;
apart from the ghosts that are haunting his home&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:40.400
despite all the weird occurrences in the past&nbsp;
few days jeff doesn't seem to understand what's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:45.920
really happening but the weird dreams the strange&nbsp;
sounds and those states in which he loses complete&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:51.760
control indicate that something bad is going&nbsp;
on whether it is schizophrenia or being haunted&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:57.600
i think both require action that is why during one&nbsp;
of the next days he fixates a camera in the corner&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:02.400
of jenny's room if there are strange things&nbsp;
happening then we must be able to capture it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:07.040
before the next night creeps in though jeff's boss&nbsp;
comes in to check his progress the conversation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:12.320
drifts into spirits and ghosts jeff is obviously&nbsp;
concerned about the strange happenings at home&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:17.680
but he has a hard time believing ghosts are real&nbsp;
before going home though he meets samantha and his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:22.960
daughter in the park if you ask me the babysitter&nbsp;
so far has been a strangest thing in this movie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:29.200
and this you know everybody knows men just get&nbsp;
better with age proofs it once again she is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:34.240
constantly hitting on him it is very obvious but&nbsp;
jeff doesn't seem to be aware of it until they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:40.240
arrive at home because there samantha casually&nbsp;
pours into drinks as if this was her house then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:46.880
she walks over to jeff hands him a drink and leans&nbsp;
forward to kiss him he backs away embarrassed she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:51.680
leaves in my book however she should have been&nbsp;
fired but jeff seems to be attracted to her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:56.480
and i will explain what i mean with that shortly&nbsp;
but first let's have a look what the camera has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.480 --> 00:08:02.000
caught during the following night after samantha&nbsp;
has left jeff went back to his study to finish off&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.960
some work but at the same time he's streaming&nbsp;
live footage of the camera in jenny's room&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:12.640
when the image suddenly starts to flicker a&nbsp;
shadowy figure appears in a corner of the room&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:18.880
he rushes upstairs arriving in the room jenny&nbsp;
isn't there but the window is open the worst&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:25.840
case goes through his mind until something&nbsp;
under a blanket is creeping up behind him

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:33.200
i guess this time it was only his daughter but&nbsp;
it becomes increasingly clear that something&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:38.240
isn't right personally the shadowy figure from&nbsp;
before wouldn't let me be in peace i would not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:43.520
spend the night in here however what is even&nbsp;
scarier than that is that the next morning jeff&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:49.280
calls over samantha to take care of his daughter&nbsp;
again this is strange this woman obviously wants&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:53.840
more from you than you can give her in my&nbsp;
book keeping her around isn't a good idea&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:59.200
it is almost as if jeff is lonely and that&nbsp;
she's more like a caretaker to him than&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:04.560
jenny now when samantha too hears a loud noise&nbsp;
banging from upstairs she goes to have a look&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:10.800
yeah having a small girl standing in an oversized&nbsp;
t-shirt on top of a menacing staircase leading&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:16.800
into darkness is not gonna happen now samantha&nbsp;
thinks likewise however that doesn't stop the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:22.960
spirit from creeping her out when jeff comes home&nbsp;
he finds her traumatized sitting on the stairs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:26.960
the conversation they have is really&nbsp;
weird but at this point we should stop&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:31.760
questioning it basically samantha asks jeff&nbsp;
to binge watch some movies downstairs and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:38.640
get high together of course he rejects her to&nbsp;
which she replies this man you used to be fun&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:44.240
but jeff goes back to continue his work as if&nbsp;
nothing happened however all his drawings are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:49.600
screwed up desperately he confronts jenny to&nbsp;
ask her why she did that but she denies being&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:54.960
the culprit the conversation shifts into a talk&nbsp;
about the deceased mother again she tells him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:54.960 --> 00:10:00.160
for instance that her mom keeps visiting her and&nbsp;
that she keeps telling her that it was him who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:05.440
killed her which as we all know is a complete&nbsp;
la now the next day jeff visits his boss Alan&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:10.480
to explain the situation about the screwed up&nbsp;
inkings he understands and gives him extra days&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:16.000
to finish off the job he even goes out of his way&nbsp;
and inquires about what exactly happened and again&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:22.080
they start talking about spirits and ghosts but&nbsp;
this time Alan is unusually serious in his tone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:27.200
when he finds out that jeff and maggie used&nbsp;
to often fight before she passed away and that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:33.600
always in front of jenny herself he concludes that&nbsp;
jenny must be traumatized and suffer from ptsd&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:38.800
but he also points out that this isn't just&nbsp;
trauma you see jenny has been drawing the same&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:43.840
dark figure like jeff has in a state of trance&nbsp;
but he has never shown any of these sketches to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:49.440
his daughter so how could she draw the exact same&nbsp;
thing this leads Alan to conclude that the grudged&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:54.800
spirit of maggie is haunting both of them with the&nbsp;
goal of driving a wedge between them now jeff who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:54.800 --> 00:11:00.720
was at first skeptic about this whole idea starts&nbsp;
to understand he then asks Alan what he should do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:06.960
and he replies this you need to talk to her you&nbsp;
need to speak to your wife before something very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:13.200
bad happens Alan walks over to his drawer opens&nbsp;
it up takes out the wooden ornament box and hands&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:20.320
it over to jeff now this isn't some supernatural&nbsp;
type of salt ladies and gentlemen nope in 2021 we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:27.520
do not fight spirits with salt and medallion in&nbsp;
2021 we fight spirits with ayahuasca you heard&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:33.440
that right what he gives jeff is a herbal drink&nbsp;
containing the psychedelic and clarifies that he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:38.640
jeff needs to connect with maggie and finish&nbsp;
off their ongoing feud i might add here that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:45.680
ayahuasca is commonly known as a bridge to&nbsp;
the spirit world i mean let's go let us enter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:52.240
the void now we cut back home and before we get to&nbsp;
the climax jenny suffers from an allergic reaction&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:57.600
while jeff is busy trying to rescue her the screws&nbsp;
of the lamp above samantha are being unscrewed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:02.640
it looks like the spirit is about to screw a&nbsp;
samantha here now the lamp eventually knocks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:08.080
her unconscious and while jeff is able to save&nbsp;
his daughter passes out because of this incident&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:13.200
the police arrive and investigate what exactly&nbsp;
happened even though they first suspect jeff&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:18.160
to be an abusive father they eventually let him&nbsp;
be for the time being at the same time maggie's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:23.760
father joins as well not that that was necessary&nbsp;
but before he can make a scene jeff offers him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:28.880
to take in jenny for the night and then discuss&nbsp;
her future tomorrow now he willingly agrees of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:34.880
course and after everyone is left jeff decides to&nbsp;
confront his deceased wife with drinking the brew&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:40.400
Alan has given him before now nothing happens at&nbsp;
first but eventually his reality starts to distort&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:46.080
he is confused but then suddenly he is facing off&nbsp;
the dark figure that has been hunting him and his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:50.800
daughter in the weeks before before anything&nbsp;
meaningful can happen though he wakes up on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:56.640
the floor as if it was only a dream which is a&nbsp;
common thing after the consumption of this herb&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:56.640 --> 00:13:02.400
now he was able to confront maggie but it wasn't&nbsp;
long enough to come to a solution but it seems he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:08.720
has gained some confidence during this experience&nbsp;
because the next day multiple things happen at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:14.000
family court for instance jeff is able to convince&nbsp;
maggie's dad about keeping custody and at the same&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:19.280
time decides to move upstate near him he continues&nbsp;
to be a grown-up man for the first time in his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:24.800
movie and negotiates a work from home deal with&nbsp;
his bosses and is able to keep his job as well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:30.240
now that is all great and stuff of course but at&nbsp;
the same time maggie's father arrives at the house&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:35.840
to pick up jenny but before he can get to her he&nbsp;
receives a message from the police saying that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:41.280
they have successfully identified the culprit who&nbsp;
killed his daughter now before he can alert jeff&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:46.720
though he is pushed down the staircase it looks&nbsp;
like he was pushed by an invisible force but would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:51.760
the spirit of his starter really do something&nbsp;
like that i guess by now it should be clear what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:57.280
is really going on here as samantha tried to run&nbsp;
off with jenny a bright red light starts to glow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:02.480
the spirit of maggie is about to join the party&nbsp;
at the same time jeff arrives back home and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:07.600
finds his ex-wife's father lying crippled at the&nbsp;
stairs now he isn't dead fortunately and is able&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:13.520
to point at his phone samantha rushes down and&nbsp;
screams at jeff to run away however before she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:19.440
can continue talking jeff opens up the email with&nbsp;
the identified culprit and finds out that samantha&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:24.080
was the one who killed his wife now it&nbsp;
was also her who pushed down grandfather&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:29.600
poisoned jenny and likely even destroyed his&nbsp;
sketches now she starts to freak out like a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:35.120
maniac she tries to talk her way out of it her&nbsp;
eyes tell that she is the real monster here until

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:47.040
it's over then the movie continues with the long&nbsp;
overdue confrontation between maggie and jeff&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:52.000
they eventually seem to agree with each other&nbsp;
and we get a cheesy but kind of epic looking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:58.640
but definitely unnecessary slow-mo free fall&nbsp;
of daughter and father and then a cute scene in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:05.040
which both of them plan ahead a brighter future by&nbsp;
leaving the past behind let me know what you think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:10.240
