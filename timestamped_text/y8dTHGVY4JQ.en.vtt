00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.070
Welcome back to Movie Recaps.

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.890
Today I will show you a romantic drama and
mystery film from 2017, titled 2:22.

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.070
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:10.960
Watch out and take care.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.760
The movie opens on a dream sequence happening
on Grand Central Station in New York with

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:19.040
a man walking into the station and another
walking up to a woman with a gun.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.450
Another man draws his own gun and tells the
first one to stop, then he turns and they

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:23.730
stand off.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.070
The clock in the station shows the time at
2:22 with gunshots and screams in the background.

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.480
Dylan wakes up from the dream and goes through
his morning routine, listening to the news

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.480
about a rare cosmic event.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.430
He drinks his coffee, takes a shower, and
after leaves for work on his bike driving

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.040
recklessly on the street.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.660
A truck almost hits him, he sees an ambulance,
then two women talking and some construction

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:46.970
work until he reaches Grand Central.

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.870
He takes the train to the airport where he
works as an air traffic controller.

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.650
Dylan thinks of his job as finding order in
the chaos and is quite good at it.

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:58.050
That night, he has drinks with his co-workers
and one of them gives him tickets for the

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.630
aerial ballet.

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:03.780
Over the next few days, he wakes up and follows
his daily routine, thinking that routines

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.040
present some kind of pattern, which he is
obsessed with.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.360
One day, we see him at his job at the traffic
control room with the hour coming close to

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.610
2:22.

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.450
Sarah is in one of the planes that are about
to land which Dylan is in charge of.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.010
The plane engages its wheels to prepare for
landing while another plane on the tracks

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:21.930
gets cleared for take-off.

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.250
When the clock reaches 2:22 the landing plane
experiences something strange and Dylan notices

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.390
a strange pattern on his monitor.

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.619
It looks as if time has stopped for him at
that hour and he has a vision of his dream

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.030
of the station.

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.020
Because he zoned out, a problem with the two
planes occurs and a possible collision between

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.850
them is becoming eminent.

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.210
Dylan sees the solution for the problem and
directs both of the planes on what they should

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.720
do, to the dismay of his coworkers.

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.159
The planes pass dangerously close to each
other as one of them takes off and the other

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:49.680
one lands.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.180
Dylan gets suspended for four weeks pending
a full board review.

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.020
The next day, Dylan goes through Grand Central
Station to get to the ballet.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.509
Suddenly, the windows in the station shatter,
making him pause and look at the clock, stuck

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:03.070
on 2:22.

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.490
He arrives at the theater and takes his seat
when a woman walking in the performance hall

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.140
catches his eye.

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.159
Dylan looks at Sarah during the aerial ballet,
seeing how much she enjoys it.

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:13.840
At one point their glances meet.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.989
Later, he sees Sarah in the theater bar and
he approaches her, realizing that she's crying.

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:22.779
He gives her a tissue and tries to comfort
her, sitting down on her table and making

00:02:22.779 --> 00:02:24.249
conversation.

00:02:24.249 --> 00:02:28.430
Dylan asks her if she wants a drink and Sarah
says that she does, but not there.

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.909
They go on a date in a bar and he tells her
that his dad was a pilot.

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:36.249
They have dinner later and when Sarah asks
why he didn't follow in his father's footsteps,

00:02:36.249 --> 00:02:38.969
Dylan answers that he is terribly afraid of
flying.

00:02:38.969 --> 00:02:43.299
She tells him that she works in an art gallery,
but that she really wanted to be a dancer.

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:46.760
Their date continues long in the night and
Dylan shares what happened a few days ago

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.590
at work when he nearly killed 900 people.

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.700
Sarah realizes that it was her flight and
when Dylan apologizes for almost killing her,

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.090
she says that actually, he saved her.

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.239
They leave the restaurant and both say that
they feel like they've known each other forever.

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:04.980
The next day, Sarah is at work at the gallery
when she is joined by her ex-boyfriend Jonas,

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.280
one of the artists that will have a show there
soon.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.919
He asks Sarah, whom he clearly still has feelings
for, how she liked the ballet the day before

00:03:11.919 --> 00:03:15.620
and misses the fact that she actually isn't
talking about ballet at all when she answers

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:16.700
him.

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.680
Jonas even tells her that she's glowing.

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.419
Meanwhile, Dylan gets a phone call informing
him that he'd left his wallet at the train

00:03:22.419 --> 00:03:26.610
the other day when he hears and sees an accident
happening in front of his building.

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.209
Dylan gets his wallet from the station and
sees the following things there: a businessman

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:34.609
reading a paper, a couple embracing, school
kids and their teacher, and a pregnant woman

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:36.010
waiting for someone.

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.919
The lights begin flickering and when the clock
reaches 2:22, sparks start coming out of it.

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:44.870
Later, Dylan goes to visit Sarah's gallery
and stuns her by showing up there, then he

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.069
asks her to go to dinner with him.

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:50.120
Sarah laughs because it's a bit early in the
day for that so they have coffee together

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.730
in the park instead.

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.139
She finally tells him why she's not a ballet
dancer.

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:58.339
It was because she had an injury very early
in her blossoming ballet career and couldn't

00:03:58.339 --> 00:03:59.999
perform anymore.

00:03:59.999 --> 00:04:03.330
Dylan cheers her up by playing music on his
phone and asking her out for a dance in the

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:04.330
park.

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.889
They dance together and later get back to
her place and sleep together.

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:11.529
The next morning, they're lying in bed and
she tells him when her birthday is, which

00:04:11.529 --> 00:04:14.200
surprises him because it's his birthday as
well.

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.280
Suddenly, he hears a car crash outside and
checks his watch to see if it happened at

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:19.950
the same time as the other.

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:24.150
Later, Sarah talks to Jonas at work and when
he finds out that she's seeing someone, he

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.130
pretends to be happy for her.

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:30.340
Dylan is in a cab, going someplace, when he
begins to notice the same things he does when

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:34.360
he goes to work, only done by other people
in different parts of the city.

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.780
He freaks out and argues with the cabbie to
take another route when they have a massive

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.510
collision with a truck.

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:42.990
Dylan gets rescued out of the cab by some
onlookers, but then stumbles away from the

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.560
scene with just a small injury on his head.

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.910
He goes to Grand Central Station and gets
to Sarah's immediately telling her about the

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:51.330
things that he repeatedly sees there.

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.180
Dylan tells her about the businessman, the
couple, the school kids, and a pregnant woman

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:56.560
under the clock.

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.290
When it strikes 2:22 things begin to explode
on the station.

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:03.070
Sarah comforts him and maybe she thinks he
has a concussion?

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:06.510
Later, Dylan gets back home and water drips
on his hand.

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:09.980
He thinks that everything that he sees and
hears is part of some giant pattern that he

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:14.040
needs to figure out so he starts writing down
all the things he remembers on some parchment

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.140
paper.

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:18.920
Dylan leaves his house again, paying close
attention to all the things on his way, and

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:21.090
writes them down on the parchment paper.

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:25.010
He gets to work and tells his co-worker that
he feels like he's losing his mind, then says

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:28.470
that things are happening to him that can't
possibly be explained.

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:31.500
Dylan's co-worker doesn't know how to help
him but tells him that they should do something

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.560
for his birthday that's in three days.

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.700
Later, Dylan can be seen getting overwhelmed
by all of the things he hears and thinks might

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:41.090
be part of the pattern so he goes back to
his apartment and writes them down in a new

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:43.560
place where he can see them more easily.

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:47.850
He makes an enormous list that includes everything
that he keeps seeing in the station as well,

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:50.990
then wonders if everything will end in a climactic
way.

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:54.460
It's the night of Jonas's show opening which
is called convergence.

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:58.200
Dylan arrives at the gallery and before Sarah
can approach him, she's swiftly taken away

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:01.020
by Jonas to watch his artistic display.

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:05.490
Everyone crowds in another room in the gallery
and Sarah introduces Dylan to Jonas.

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:09.280
His artwork is a light installation that captures
Grand Central Station.

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:13.430
The audience is transported inside the station
with all of its parts appearing slowly.

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:19.140
Suddenly, Dylan notices that Jonas has included
the clock in his exhibit, stuck on 2:22.

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:22.770
Other elements of Dylan's pattern emerge within
the work, such as the businessman and the

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:24.980
pregnant woman that looks like Sarah.

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:28.890
The clock turns back time and the work changes
when Jonas approaches Dylan and he asks him

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:32.531
if the piece is some sort of joke and if he's
been following him, thinking that all of it

00:06:32.531 --> 00:06:34.520
is connected to his pattern.

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:38.140
Jonas has no idea what is going on and they
begin to struggle.

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:42.060
Sarah and the gallery manager pull them off
each other, then another curator begins clapping

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:44.400
because he thinks it's all part of the show.

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:48.250
He congratulates Jonas for recreating a famous
murder scene that happened on the station

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:49.540
years earlier.

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:52.890
But neither Jonas nor anyone else understands
what he means.

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:56.280
The curator tells the audience that he has
another interpretation of the murder in his

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:57.800
own gallery.

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:01.600
Sarah drags Dylan away, upset with him, telling
him to let himself out.

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:05.750
He leaves and sends her an apology text, then
gest back to the gallery and sees her talking

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:08.360
to Jonas, getting a little jealous.

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:12.760
The next day, he exercises furiously while
listening to the news reporting on the cosmic

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:16.090
phenomenon that will be at its peak in the
following two days.

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:19.890
Dylan breaks his exercise equipment and when
he tries to fix it, he sees a parcel hidden

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:21.580
in the beam of his celling.

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:25.520
He opens the parcel to find a passport with
the name Jake Redmond and some letters addressed

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.030
to the same person.

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:28.620
The letters are love letters.

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:32.400
Meanwhile, he tries to reach Sarah and when
he can't he goes to see the other exhibit

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:34.070
of the murder scene.

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:37.750
Dylan looks over the images in the interpretation
and the curator joins him.

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:41.370
He tells him the story of what happened as
they look at the image of the killer.

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:44.860
The killer gunned down a pregnant woman and
a cop before he was himself gunned down by

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:45.860
the cops.

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:51.150
Lastly, he shows him a photograph of the original
crime scene in Grand Central Station.

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:54.080
Dylan sees the name Jake Redmond under the
photograph.

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:57.740
When he comes back home, he does some research
on the station and finds an article about

00:07:57.740 --> 00:07:58.860
the murder.

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:01.900
The woman was murdered in a jealous rage by
her lover.

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:05.440
Dylan checks Jake's passport and sees that
he was born on the same date as him exactly

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:07.000
30 years earlier.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.790
He notices the return address on the letters
and decides to check out the place to find

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:12.980
out more information about the woman.

00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:16.830
Her sister lives in her place now and when
she sees the letters, she asks Dylan why he

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:18.400
came to see her.

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:22.580
Dylan says that he doesn't know exactly, he
simply feels a connection to her sister.

00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:26.580
The woman tells him all about her sister Evelyn
Mills, who was a prolific singer and a kind

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:27.620
person.

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:30.090
She met Jake during one of her performances.

00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:33.379
Evelyn fell for him deeply and didn't give
up on him when she found out that he was a

00:08:33.379 --> 00:08:35.019
career criminal.

00:08:35.019 --> 00:08:38.709
Everyone tried to warn her, including Noah
Marks, who was the detective that died in

00:08:38.709 --> 00:08:39.709
the station.

00:08:39.709 --> 00:08:43.539
Evelyn's sister tells Dylan that he was probably
in love with her too because she had that

00:08:43.539 --> 00:08:45.170
effect on men.

00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:48.089
Dylan asks what she was doing at Grand Central
Station.

00:08:48.089 --> 00:08:51.809
Her sister tells him that Detective Marks
came in one day and told Evelyn things about

00:08:51.809 --> 00:08:55.230
Jake she didn't know, like how he was a very
violent man.

00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:58.399
So the detective wanted to hide Evelyn in
his place in Millhurst and that's how they

00:08:58.399 --> 00:08:59.579
got there.

00:08:59.579 --> 00:09:01.769
She hands Dylan Jake's letters to her.

00:09:01.769 --> 00:09:05.829
When he gets back home, Dylan tries to figure
out the pattern and sees a correlation between

00:09:05.829 --> 00:09:09.430
the placement of the airplanes the day Sarah
landed and the placement of the bodies in

00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:11.870
Grand Central Station after the murder.

00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:15.260
He writes Sarah about the connection he's
found and begs her to call him.

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:19.329
Meanwhile, Sarah enters the light installation
and Jonas joins her there.

00:09:19.329 --> 00:09:23.220
She tells him about Dylan, then asks Jonas
why he wanted to make it about Grand Central

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:24.550
Station.

00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:28.380
Jonas tells her that he had the idea much
earlier before he even met her.

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:31.959
Sarah says that Dylan sees the same type of
people in the station that Jonas has in his

00:09:31.959 --> 00:09:34.629
installation and that he thinks it's a pattern.

00:09:34.629 --> 00:09:38.450
Jonas thinks that people that see patterns
in everything aren't exactly sane.

00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:41.939
Dylan gets to the station to get a ticket
to Millhurst, but the ticket seller tells

00:09:41.939 --> 00:09:44.569
him that the line has been closed for 30 years.

00:09:44.569 --> 00:09:48.790
He turns around to see the board change in
the correct line and the clock strikes 2:22

00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:52.029
so the chandelier in the station falls down
and shatters.

00:09:52.029 --> 00:09:55.410
Dylan now resolves into filming everything
that he sees on his way home while checking

00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:56.610
the time.

00:09:56.610 --> 00:10:00.180
That night, he's back home working on the
pattern problem, when Sarah comes over to

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:01.250
see him.

00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:05.110
He apologizes to her and she asks him if he's
ok, thinking that there is something else

00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:06.569
going on with him.

00:10:06.569 --> 00:10:11.860
In the meantime, Jonas is working on his installation,
making the pregnant woman look like Sarah.

00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:15.490
Back at Dylan's, she sees his lists and confronts
him about them.

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:19.420
Dylan explains his Evelyn and Jake discovery,
but Sarah is worried that he might be losing

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:20.690
his marbles.

00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:24.329
He says that the incident happened exactly
30 years before their birthday which is the

00:10:24.329 --> 00:10:25.620
next day.

00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:28.559
Dylan tells her that they are them and shows
her the letters explaining that those were

00:10:28.559 --> 00:10:31.230
actually written by them a lifetime ago.

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:34.670
Sarah can't listen to his "theories" anymore,
so she tells him that none of what he's saying

00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:38.339
means anything, that all of the things he's
been seeing and hearing are just random big

00:10:38.339 --> 00:10:40.759
city stuff that happens every day.

00:10:40.759 --> 00:10:44.259
Dylan thinks that she doesn't understand,
but she demonstrates it to him by opening

00:10:44.259 --> 00:10:46.540
the window and linking the noises.

00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:50.130
Sarah tells him that she feels all kinds of
special about him, but Dylan just says that

00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:54.710
the woman she's supposed to be - dies because
the man he's supposed to be - kills her.

00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:59.009
His solution is that they can never see each
other again and kicks her out of his place.

00:10:59.009 --> 00:11:02.490
Dylan gets extra upset and breaks the glass
with his list of patterns.

00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:06.950
Later, Sarah arrives at Jonas's place and
asks him about Grand Central again, telling

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:09.499
him about the connection Dylan sees between
everything.

00:11:09.499 --> 00:11:14.119
Jonas, however, thinks that it's all a coincidence
and says that Dylan needs a shrink.

00:11:14.119 --> 00:11:16.420
He tells Sarah that what she's doing has to
stop.

00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:20.459
Then, says that he wants to take her away
for a few days because, judging by the way

00:11:20.459 --> 00:11:23.769
Dylan was looking at him, he thinks he wanted
to kill him.

00:11:23.769 --> 00:11:27.579
Jonas thinks that Dylan is out of control
and that she's not safe, but Sarah tells him

00:11:27.579 --> 00:11:29.610
that she loves Dylan very much.

00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:33.089
He's afraid that he might do something to
hurt Sarah and is considering killing himself

00:11:33.089 --> 00:11:36.869
when he looks at the sky and makes another
connection with the constellations.

00:11:36.869 --> 00:11:38.880
The next day is their birthday.

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:42.589
Dylan continues to think about the patterns
as a news report about the cosmic phenomenon

00:11:42.589 --> 00:11:44.339
is plays out on the TV.

00:11:44.339 --> 00:11:48.410
Suddenly, Dylan has a massive realization
about the pattern and finds the only things

00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:50.369
in it that are actually connected.

00:11:50.369 --> 00:11:54.179
The news reporter saying that the phenomenon
they are now seeing actually happened 30 years

00:11:54.179 --> 00:11:58.089
ago and Dylan begins connecting everything
to the moment that he dies.

00:11:58.089 --> 00:12:02.459
Simultaneously, Sarah gets in a cab with Jonas
that will take them to the airport.

00:12:02.459 --> 00:12:06.149
Jonas tells her that a couple of days in Millhurst
will do her wonders.

00:12:06.149 --> 00:12:10.249
Dylan leaves his place and follows the patterns,
leading him to Jonas's apartment.

00:12:10.249 --> 00:12:14.589
He slams at the door, but when no one answers
he finds a way to break the lock.

00:12:14.589 --> 00:12:18.860
Inside he finds giant photos of Sarah, as
well as an entire wall of smaller ones and

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:21.170
a notebook with sketches from the station.

00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:25.350
Dylan also finds an empty pistol case and
realizes Jonas is Noah Marks.

00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:29.040
He calls Sarah, but Jonas asks her not to
answer when he gets a text that their flight

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:30.630
has been canceled.

00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:34.490
Jonas diverts the cab to Grand Central Station,
to Sarah's horror.

00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:38.019
Dylan runs toward the station, having realized
that it will still all go down as he thought

00:12:38.019 --> 00:12:39.269
it would.

00:12:39.269 --> 00:12:42.529
Jonas and Sarah arrive there and he goes to
get the tickets.

00:12:42.529 --> 00:12:46.180
Sarah sees the clock and follows it, then
listens to Dylan's message that he knows what

00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:49.480
the patterns are and that he's been seeing
the day that they die.

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:53.119
Jonas gets the same information from the seller
as Dylan and gets tickets to another place

00:12:53.119 --> 00:12:54.579
close by.

00:12:54.579 --> 00:12:58.170
Dylan has an incident with the police and
he grabs one of their guns, but instead of

00:12:58.170 --> 00:13:02.290
putting the gun down he slides it and jumps
through a window to get to the station.

00:13:02.290 --> 00:13:05.410
Jonas gets to Sarah with the tickets, but
she doesn't want to have anything to do with

00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:06.670
him anymore.

00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:10.740
He doesn't want to let her go, calling her
Evelyn and saying that she must love him.

00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:12.810
Sarah doesn't though which upsets him.

00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:17.959
Suddenly, Dylan arrives and calls to her getting
Jonas angrier so he reaches for his gun.

00:13:17.959 --> 00:13:22.930
Sarah sees what Dylan has been seeing - businessman,
couple, schoolchildren - and realizes that

00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:26.930
in their version of events, she's the pregnant
woman standing under the clock.

00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:30.839
Jonas points his gun at Dylan, freaking everybody
out and saying that she'll never be his as

00:13:30.839 --> 00:13:32.839
he points the gun at Sarah.

00:13:32.839 --> 00:13:35.980
Dylan runs to her and jumps in front of Sarah
as Jonas shoots.

00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:41.160
The clock is close to 2:22 and he knows that
the cops are coming, so he turns to face Jonas.

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:45.470
The original version of the situation is revealed,
in which Jake is the one protecting Evelyn

00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:47.980
like Dylan is protecting Sarah now.

00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:53.120
Before Jonas can fire another shot, the clock
strikes 2:22 and the cops gun him down.

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:56.329
Dylan drops to the ground and the entire story
plays out.

00:13:56.329 --> 00:14:00.079
Jake was never the murderer but was framed
by the cops to protect their own.

00:14:00.079 --> 00:14:03.029
And in the end, only love can reveal the truth.

00:14:03.029 --> 00:14:05.110
Dylan doesn't die when the clock changes to
2:23.

00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:10.369
In the last image of the film, Sarah is revealed
standing next to their baby looking out of

00:14:10.369 --> 00:14:13.639
their apartment to Dylan who has become a
commercial airline pilot.

00:14:13.639 --> 00:14:23.350
He looks at his watch, happy that the patterns
aren't there anymore.
