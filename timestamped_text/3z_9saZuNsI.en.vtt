00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.260
Welcome back to Movie Recaps.

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:06.740
Today I will show you a horror movie from
2020, called Anything for Jackson.

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:07.770
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.690
Watch out and take care.

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.389
An old couple are seen having a casual conversation
in their home.

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:17.390
They are wondering if a woman has arrived
already, then they hear her outside and follow

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:18.550
after her.

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:23.050
Suddenly, they're seen dragging a woman inside
the house, as the wife says mind the baby

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.040
and hits the woman over the head.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.900
The husband takes the woman upstairs with
the elevator, as the wife closes the front

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:29.900
door.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.559
The woman is seen gaged and a child's hand
is touching her on the face.

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:37.149
She wakes up frantic, seeing a child next
to her, greeting her.

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:41.290
The wife calls out that she's awake and when
the husband joins them, she introduces herself

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:43.339
as Audrey and him as Henry.

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:48.190
She tells the woman - Shannon, that they felt
this would be the best way for her to go missing.

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.710
Audrey says that they won't hurt her or her
baby, then sends Henry off to do the test.

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.059
He's outside and as the woman starts screaming
inside the house, he calls his wife and tells

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.519
her that nothing can be heard outside.

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:02.949
Shannon asks what they want from her and Audrey
tells her that they need to bring their grandson

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:03.999
back.

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:08.070
When she asks if the boy in the room is the
grandson, the old woman is surprised that

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.189
she can see him because he's dead.

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:14.200
Audrey puts on some music in the room, saying
Jackson loves music and leaves her alone with

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.320
him.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.479
Audrey tells Henry that Jackson showed himself
to the woman, which makes him happy.

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:22.720
He leaves for work and on his way out runs
into Rory.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.549
Audrey comes back into the room, bringing
vitamins for the woman and going through her

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.130
things, taking her phone out of her pocket,
as well as some pills.

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.350
When she leaves for a moment to get her glasses,
the woman grabs the phone, but is quickly

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.109
stopped by Audrey coming back in the room.

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:41.180
She unlocks her phone and goes on her social
media, sending a message to a man to meet

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:42.969
her later that day.

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:45.350
Audrey calls Henry at work and tells him it's
done.

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.720
At his practice, his assistant asks about
Shannon, who was his patient and if she'll

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.800
be coming in soon considering she's nearing
her due date.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.600
He lies his way out of the situation.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.420
In a flashback, the old couple is seen with
an ancient book preparing to raise a raven

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.140
back from the dead.

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.640
Audrey chants an incantation and the raven
is brought back.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.320
Henry doesn't like what she's doing, but she
tells him that she only needed proof if the

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:09.690
book is real.

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.959
Back in the present, the two of them walk
to a community center, trying to keep up appearances

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:15.620
and they meet with Ian.

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.150
He tells them that he couldn't find the book
they already have and Audrey is upset he might

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:20.459
tell someone about it.

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:22.530
They walk into a Satanist meeting.

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.430
As everyone puts on their robes and light
black candles, the main priestess starts the

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:27.840
prayer to Satan.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.860
In another flashback, Henry is talking to
Shannon as her doctor, telling her that she's

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:32.910
pregnant.

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.890
She's not happy about it, considering she
doesn't even know the fathers name.

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.760
As he's trying to calm her, he also texts
his wife that he found the right one and takes

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.930
a picture of Shannon for his wife.

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.239
The same picture is seen on the wall in the
room she's sleeping in.

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:50.510
She coughs up blood, waking up to see that
the couple have prepared the room for a Satanist

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:51.640
ceremony.

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.360
She begs them not to go through with it, as
they are already praying and inviting Satan

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.780
into their home.

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.930
They both cut their hands to offer their blood
and spill it onto a heart, when Shannon begins

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.019
convulsing.

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:05.830
They pray in Latin, as everything in the room
animates and they finally see Jackson in the

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:06.910
room.

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.420
He points toward the woman, as Audrey keeps
reading and then he disappears.

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.849
A demon appears next to Shannon for a few
moments and when it's gone, the couple check

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:17.610
to see how she is and hear the baby's heartbeat.

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.220
Audrey thinks it's Jackson's heartbeat, but
Henry isn't convinced.

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.640
The following morning Henry wakes up and Audrey
isn't next to him.

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.370
He looks over to the bathroom and a woman
is flossing her teeth, as he keeps talking

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.420
to her, thinking it's Audrey.

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.470
Suddenly, his wife calls him on the phone
and he realizes that the woman in the bathroom

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:35.810
isn't Audrey.

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.349
She doesn't stop flossing her teeth and they
keep falling on the ground.

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:41.549
She turns and walks toward Henry.

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:44.849
Suddenly, Audrey comes in the room and the
woman disappears.

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:49.829
Later, he's working in his office, when a
police officer comes to see him.

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:53.270
Detective Bellows tells him that Shannon is
a missing person and that she's tracing her

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:54.349
steps.

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:57.970
Henry lies that she canceled her appointment,
but his assistant reminds him of the lie he

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.160
told her before, that he saw her walking by
his house the day she went missing.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.939
The detective isn't fooled by his shenanigans.

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:08.430
He calls Audrey and tells her what happened,
but she doesn't take the fact that he changed

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:09.739
the plan lightly.

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:13.250
Suddenly, there's a knock on the door and
she goes to answer it.

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.040
There's a ghost trick-or-treating on the other
side.

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.989
Audrey dismisses the ghost and closes the
door, but there's another knock.

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:23.150
She opens the back door and the ghost is there
too.

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.380
Immediately as she closes that one the ghost
knocks on another door, inside the house.

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:31.740
She walks upstairs to call Henry, but hears
running in the house and when she looks down,

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.230
it's the little ghost.

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:36.870
She finally reaches Henry on the phone and
tells him what is happening, when he tells

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.710
her to give the ghost her soul.

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.460
She chases after the ghost to the elevator,
but it comes out of it transformed into a

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.160
giant version of itself.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.520
Later, Shannon asks Audrey why she was screaming
before and she says that her daughter came

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:49.760
to see her.

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.470
She avoids the question about what happened
to her daughter.

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:56.630
Shannon is left alone in the room and immediately
tries to escape, but when she reaches to one

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:00.169
of her restraints, sees a man suffocating
next to her bed.

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:04.710
He stands up, walks around the room, then
notices her and walks back to her, crawling

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:08.880
on top of her and biting into her pregnant
belly as she screams for Audrey.

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:13.200
She's at the door and can't get it open, but
when she finally does, the suffocating ghost

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.770
runs toward her.

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.319
Suddenly Henry appears, stopping the ghostly
manifestation.

00:05:18.319 --> 00:05:22.139
The couple are getting ready for bed, as Henry
tells her that he stitched up Shannon and

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:23.830
she'll be alright.

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:26.430
Audrey doesn't know what they did and wonders
if they made a mistake.

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:30.750
In a flashback, Henry meets with Shannon outside
of his house.

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:33.700
She's excited to be a mom, not afraid anymore.

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:38.250
Back in the present, Rory comes back and Henry
goes to meet him, while Audrey plans to sedate

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:39.250
Shannon.

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:43.450
The two men talk outside, but the man is persistent
to clean his drive way.

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:47.840
He starts the machine in front of the house,
as Audrey and Henry argue inside.

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:51.360
She's afraid that they did the ritual wrong
and Jackson isn't there.

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:55.110
Rory calls out to them from the front yard
and says that they did it right and Jackson

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:58.759
is coming back to them, then suddenly puts
his head inside the machine.

00:05:58.759 --> 00:06:02.410
Later, Audrey goes inside the room to clean
Shannon up.

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:05.950
She removes the restraints and puts a cozy
on the handcuffs.

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:09.599
Shannon asks if they'll kill her after they
get the baby, but Audrey says that their rule

00:06:09.599 --> 00:06:11.300
was not to harm her.

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:15.350
As they talk, the door of the room opens and
Audrey tells her that she reminds her of her

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:16.419
daughter.

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:20.160
She was in the same accident with Jackson,
but didn't die right away.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.670
She killed herself in the elevator in the
house.

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:26.910
Meanwhile, Henry is burying Rory in the woods,
when his phone rings.

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:30.740
It's the detective doing a follow up with
him, asking to come and see him.

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:34.530
He tries to get some information out of her
and she avoids his questions.

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:37.280
She tells him she'll meet him at the house
in an hour.

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:41.540
Back at the room, Shannon pleads with Audrey
to let her be Jackson's mom, along with them,

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:43.580
to look after him after they die.

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:45.710
She says she'll do whatever they want.

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:49.570
There's a knock on the door, so Audrey gags
her again and leaves locking the door behind

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:52.340
her, but the door unlocks by itself.

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:55.470
Henry runs home, but the detective is there
already.

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:59.600
She's waiting for him inside Shannon's room,
with Audrey handcuffed next to her.

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:03.530
She tells him to get on his knees, as Shannon
is begging for her to let her out, but the

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:06.639
detective turns to her and calmly kills herself.

00:07:06.639 --> 00:07:10.910
Henry releases Audrey from the cuffs and they
get the detective's body out of the room.

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:13.199
Henry buries her in the same place as Rory.

00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:17.160
The next day, Audrey tries to tell him about
Shannon's request, but there's a knock on

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:18.290
the door.

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:20.330
It's Ian, asking for the book.

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:23.930
They show him the book and Henry tells him
the story of how he got it.

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:27.160
Audrey asks if he could read it, to which
he says that it's been written in different

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:31.110
languages and dialects, and is possibly the
oldest book in the world.

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:34.830
They ask about the invocation spell and he
tells them to show him exactly what they did

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:36.240
when they used it.

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:40.169
When they do, he says that once the door to
purgatory is opened, every ghost there will

00:07:40.169 --> 00:07:41.870
be looking for a host.

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:44.990
He asks about the host they used and they
take him to Shannon.

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:49.330
They ask Ian if Jackson is in there and he
replies that he isn't, but that he can be.

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:53.010
They need to finish the ceremony by making
a sacrifice of the mother.

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:56.952
Ian says he can perform the ceremony, if they
allow him to keep the book and give him 10

00:07:56.952 --> 00:07:58.360
thousand dollars.

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:02.450
He will perform the ceremony the next day,
but they need to put rock salt around Shannon

00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:05.080
and themselves to keep the other ghosts away.

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:09.180
That night, both Henry and Audrey are in the
room with Shannon, having put salt around

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:10.879
the entire thing.

00:08:10.879 --> 00:08:15.060
Shannon tells Henry about her idea for the
baby, but he says she can't win a moral argument

00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:17.919
with him because he already made a deal with
the devil.

00:08:17.919 --> 00:08:21.890
He tells her that Audrey was the one driving
the car when Jackson died, but she couldn't

00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:23.020
remember.

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:24.700
Henry is doing all of it for her.

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:29.419
Suddenly, the ghost of the detective walks
in and kills herself all over again.

00:08:29.419 --> 00:08:33.730
Ian is in his basement, reading the book,
when his mom calls him up for lunch.

00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:35.790
He angrily grabs his stuff and leaves.

00:08:35.790 --> 00:08:40.430
Then, he arrives at the house and as he walks
in the bedroom, the detective appears behind

00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:41.430
him.

00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:45.370
The others aren't surprised by that anymore,
saying she's been doing that all night.

00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:49.410
Ian starts right away, giving the couple instructions
on what to read.

00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:51.380
The detective walks in again.

00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:55.340
He says that salt just slows them down, but
a sacrifice will stop them.

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:59.550
Ian continues with the instructions as the
detective shows up again, but doesn't shoot

00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:00.810
herself this time.

00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:04.960
Him and Henry go outside and he measures where
certain objects should be placed around the

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:06.030
house.

00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:10.210
He tells Henry that he is the one that needs
to kill the mother, without hesitation.

00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:12.930
Because if he does hesitate, they will all
die.

00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:17.620
Back in the room, Audrey is drawing a pentagram,
as Shannon tries to distract her.

00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:21.020
She asks for some food and Audrey goes out
to get some.

00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:24.870
Shannon breaks out from her restraints and
pours water on herself, pretending she's having

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:26.140
the baby.

00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:28.210
Audrey comes in and calls for Henry.

00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:30.770
She's getting Shannon ready as the two men
come in.

00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:33.530
Ian disturbs the salt as he walks inside.

00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:37.301
He immediately starts reading from the book,
as Audrey is worried if Jackson is in there

00:09:37.301 --> 00:09:40.710
and Henry keeps getting messages from the
priestess of their cult.

00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:44.070
The pentagram starts shining and Ian says
it's working.

00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:47.730
Henry picks up and it's the priestess telling
him that Ian killed his mother and drew symbols

00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:49.030
on his house.

00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:53.430
He tells Audrey that something is wrong with
Ian, but tells him to keep going.

00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:57.090
Shannon gets out of her restraints and grabs
Audrey, saying she'll cut her throat if Henry

00:09:57.090 --> 00:09:58.990
doesn't undo her legs.

00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:01.440
Both Audrey and Ian tell him not to do it.

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:05.180
But Henry still does it, then Ian kills Audrey
saying a mother's a mother.

00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:09.040
He spills blood at Henry and continues the
ceremony, while Shannon is trying to get out

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:12.320
of the restraints and Audrey dies in Henry's
arms.

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:16.990
Suddenly Shannon stabs Ian and a giggling
ghost comes in and grabs him, taking him away.

00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:20.550
He can be heard screaming in the other room,
as Shannon tries to get out.

00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:24.830
Suddenly, the suffocating ghost rises behind
her and goes toward her.

00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:26.950
Henry tells her to go and to forgive them.

00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:31.420
At that moment something starts coming out
of Audrey's body and scares the other ghost.

00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:34.310
The same happens to Henry and Shannon runs
away.

00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:38.600
She sees the giggling ghost and escapes, then
the other two and goes to open the door, when

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:41.010
the giant ghost appears outside.

00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:42.230
She slams the door.

00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:46.400
Meanwhile, from the dead bodies of Audrey
and Henry, a creature has risen.

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:50.640
Shannon is in the kitchen when she sees the
keys, but suddenly the detective appears and

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:53.360
walk up to her, saying she'll protect her.

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:55.750
The creature walks out of the bedroom.

00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:59.610
Shannon comes out of the house and sees Rory
there, but walks past by him.

00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:04.000
She looks up and sees Jackson in the window,
being taken away the next moment.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.140
Shannon drives away, but as she's driving
through the woods she sees something on the

00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:08.160
road.

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:11.360
On a second look she notices it's a pregnant
woman.

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:19.330
She looks down and sees blood on her belly.
