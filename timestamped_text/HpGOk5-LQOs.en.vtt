00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.800
Welcome back to Movie Recaps. Today&nbsp;
I will show you an adventure, sci-fi,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:10.000
thriller film from 2020, titled Voyagers.
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.760
The Earth is dying. Scientists look for a new&nbsp;
planet able to sustain human life and find it in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:21.040
the year 2063. The planet is seen on screen,&nbsp;
while a woman explains that it is a planet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:26.480
humans can colonize. She continues, saying that&nbsp;
a scouting mission to the planet should be sent.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.960
Since the voyage there will take 86 years, the&nbsp;
crew of the mission will reproduce on the ship,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.040
making the third generation on board the one&nbsp;
to reach the planet. The crew is genetically&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.920
engineered on Earth by combining the genes of&nbsp;
leading scientists. A man is seen talking about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.240
the reasoning behind this plan, justifying&nbsp;
why the crew will be specifically engineered&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.160
to man the mission, consisting of children&nbsp;
raised and trained solely for its purpose.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.720
The next step is assessing when they'll&nbsp;
be ready to go. The younger the crew is,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:58.240
the longer the resources can be preserved. But,&nbsp;
the man - Richard, is worried that they might not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:03.680
be fully equipped to deal with the complexity of&nbsp;
space travel on their own. Later, Richard is seen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.400
entering a facility where the child crew is being&nbsp;
raised and he gets into full protective gear.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.040
He enters the rooms where they live and when they&nbsp;
see him they all rejoice. Richard monitors where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:18.240
they are in their education, and then tucks&nbsp;
Christopher, Sela and Zac into bed. Zac tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.440
him that he's afraid, but Richard comforts him by&nbsp;
telling him that he's safe. The next day, Richard&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.920
is talking to a woman in charge of the mission.&nbsp;
He tells her that he should go with the children,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.160
to raise and protect them. Richard's addition&nbsp;
to the mission would also mean that it will be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:37.680
able to launch in 4 years, instead of 7. Next,&nbsp;
the mission launches with Richard on the helm.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.280
The shuttle docks with Humanitas, the ship for&nbsp;
the mission. They all go inside and find their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:49.440
quarters. Richard takes one last look of Earth.
10 years later, the children are already adults,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.560
as they can be seen waking and getting&nbsp;
ready to start their days on the ship.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.120
The first lesson covers the fertilization&nbsp;
for the second generation, which will begin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.600
in the 24th year of their lives. The&nbsp;
crew goes about their day like robots.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.080
They're seen drinking a blue liquid. Christopher&nbsp;
and Zac are listening to classical music.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.600
Sela walks through the ship and looks out at the&nbsp;
space around them. Later, she talks to Richard,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.840
saying that the lives of the crew are&nbsp;
unimportant. Trying to comfort her, he shows&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.920
her pictures of his grandparents, telling her&nbsp;
that providing for the future is very important.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.400
That night, Christopher can't sleep.&nbsp;
He listens to the sounds of the ship.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.760
The next day, Richard and Christopher are in the&nbsp;
hydroponics bay checking the state of the plants,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:35.280
when a message about toxicity in the water appears&nbsp;
on Christopher's screen. He asks Richard about it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.560
thinking it's some kind of chemical that&nbsp;
isn't being processed from their urine,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:44.320
but Richard dismisses his concerns. He's&nbsp;
skeptical about it. So, later, he asks Zac&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:49.760
about the ingredient T56j. They wonder why the&nbsp;
information is unavailable. During the night,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.320
the two of them go back to figure out what&nbsp;
it is. Christopher bypasses the firewall&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:59.280
and is able to find the information. The chemical&nbsp;
ingredient is found in the blue liquid they drink.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.840
Zac thinks it was a digestion aid, but they&nbsp;
figure out that it has other effects on their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.720
personality. It makes them dull and docile,&nbsp;
decreasing their desires and pleasure responses.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.760
They're being drugged and pacified, so they don't&nbsp;
reproduce naturally and overpopulate the ship.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.960
The two of them stop drinking the blue liquid.&nbsp;
Later, they share the information with Kai&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.560
and Julie. Along with the information&nbsp;
about a hidden compartment on the ship.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.160
Later, Christopher is in a session with Richard.&nbsp;
He says he knows that he's been lying to them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:33.360
but only mentions the unmarked compartment, pod&nbsp;
23. Richard tells him that the mission must have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.400
lied to them for a reason, that the pod might&nbsp;
be for the third generation. After the session,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.400
Richard sends a message back to Earth asking if&nbsp;
he could share everything with the crew and be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.720
honest with them, so they don't lose faith in&nbsp;
him. The message will take time to get there.&nbsp;

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:52.400
The next day, while standing in line next to&nbsp;
Sela, Christopher has a fantasy about her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.280
They eat lunch and he keeps looking at her, but&nbsp;
Zac approaches her telling her that she's changed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.560
Richard comes in and tells him not to grab her,&nbsp;
as per the rules. In the gym, Christopher and Zac&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.520
are seen fighting and taking it a bit too far.&nbsp;
The others don't understand what's happening.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:12.160
The two of them start feeling the effects of not&nbsp;
taking the drug. They hear the ship noises and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.560
go to an observation room where they see one of&nbsp;
their fellow crewmembers. The three of them talk&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.880
about what it might be, so he tells them that he&nbsp;
thinks it might be some kind of alien life form.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:26.560
Sela and Richard are in his office and he shows&nbsp;
her dried plants from Earth. Zac and Christopher&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.680
hear them talking and approach the room. Zac sees&nbsp;
Richard touching Sela's shoulder and gets jealous.&nbsp;

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.480
They loose contact with Earth and Richard informs&nbsp;
them that their transmitter needs to be fixed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.480
Zac will come with him, while the&nbsp;
others continue with their roles.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.160
The preparations are under way, as Zac&nbsp;
sees Sela and approaches her again.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.480
She tells him about the suit he'll be wearing&nbsp;
and he starts touching her inappropriately.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:54.640
Richard runs in and gets him off of her. He asks&nbsp;
Zac what's happening, but he runs away. Looking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:58.640
for him, Richard sees Phoebe on the way and&nbsp;
she tells him that he stopped taking the blue.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.040
Next, he runs into Christopher and finds&nbsp;
out that he stopped taking the drug as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.760
They argue, but Richard tells him that the&nbsp;
drug was implemented to stop precisely the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:12.160
type of behavior witnessed in Zac. He asks&nbsp;
Christopher to help him fix the transmitter,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:16.080
so that when it's online he'll back him up when&nbsp;
he voices his objections to mission control.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:20.080
All of the other crewmembers are on their&nbsp;
positions in the ship, while prep for the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:25.840
spacewalk is under way. Zac enters the systems&nbsp;
room. Richard and Christopher go outside the ship.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:31.760
Christopher is experiencing sensations he hasn't&nbsp;
felt before, so Richard keeps an eye on him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:35.440
Richard repairs one of the transmitter&nbsp;
parts then goes over the the second one.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.960
Inside the ship, the noises from the ship can&nbsp;
be heard again and the crew is getting restless.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:45.120
They check to see if anything else is outside and&nbsp;
suddenly something appears on the screen next to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:50.560
Richard and Christopher. It hurts Richard, hurling&nbsp;
him away from the ship. The ship has some kind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:55.840
of malfunction as well. No one knows what has&nbsp;
happened. There is a fire in the systems room.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:01.120
Christopher brings Richard inside and they take&nbsp;
him to medical. All kinds of errors appear on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:06.160
the ship, from navigation to communication. The&nbsp;
medical team and Sela are trying to resuscitate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:11.040
Richard, but it doesn't work. Sela is the&nbsp;
chief medical officer and pronounces him dead.&nbsp;

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:14.960
Later, the crew has a meeting, where&nbsp;
they speak about what has happened.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:19.440
They mention the creaking sound. One of the&nbsp;
crewmembers says he saw something on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:23.920
monitor when it happened, that looked like a force&nbsp;
jumping into Richard, like it was something alien.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:28.880
Phoebe starts crying. Christopher comforts&nbsp;
them, saying that if they keep it together&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:33.920
they'll be alright. The systems reboot and the&nbsp;
crew is checking the surveillance archive, but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:38.720
all of the footage has been deleted by the fire in&nbsp;
the systems room. They need to choose a new chief&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:44.640
officer. Zac says that he should be chief. But&nbsp;
the others say that they need an election. All of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:50.000
them vote and place Christopher as chief officer.&nbsp;
Zac is jealous, but congratulates him regardless.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:55.520
First order of business is repairing the damage in&nbsp;
the transmitter. He gets the entire crew working&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:00.160
on the other repairs on the ship caused by the&nbsp;
fire. The surveillance system is the last thing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:05.440
on the repair list, so they can see what happened&nbsp;
to Richard. They hope the drives are intact. Sela&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:09.920
goes to his office and looks through his pictures&nbsp;
and videos, when Christopher arrives at the door.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:14.720
She tells him that she is supposed to destroy his&nbsp;
personal archive, even though she doesn't want&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:19.120
to do it. She shows him Richard's photographs&nbsp;
and they talk about the importance of parents.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:23.360
He asks why Richard told her about his life,&nbsp;
thinking that they might have been more than&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:28.480
friends, but she explains that he was just feeling&nbsp;
alone. They look through his video diary, where he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:32.400
explains how much he believes in the mission&nbsp;
and talks about how much he cares for them.&nbsp;

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:36.640
Christopher is looking for the crew and finds them&nbsp;
in the cantina, angry that they're not at their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:42.080
posts. Zac tells him that they're repairing the&nbsp;
refrigerators, so they don't lose any food. But&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:46.320
there's a bunch of food that might go bad so he&nbsp;
asks him is they can have a feast, to celebrate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:51.200
their new chief officer. After they eat, Kai tells&nbsp;
the others not to drink the blue and they all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:56.240
dump it. Sela and Christopher are looking through&nbsp;
Richard's videos laughing and enjoying themselves.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:02.160
Christopher feels increasingly more attracted to&nbsp;
her. Zac feels attracted to Julie, he touches her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:07.840
and she touches him back. The others are looking&nbsp;
at them. Later, the crew can be seen play fighting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:12.320
and running around the ship, having fun. They&nbsp;
all look through Richards personal archive.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:16.560
Sela finds them in his quarters and tells&nbsp;
them to leave, but they don't want to.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:21.040
Zac is the last to leave, telling Sela that&nbsp;
Richard isn't there anymore to protect her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:27.120
She goes back to the med bay, and grabs a scalpel.&nbsp;
Christopher is following Zac, worried he might do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:31.120
something to Sela, when he finds out that she's&nbsp;
in the med bay and goes there before Zac can.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:36.880
Zac arrives and Christopher pretends that the&nbsp;
two of them are making love, so he leaves. Sela&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:41.520
threatens him with the scalpel, not understanding&nbsp;
his intentions. But when he says he's there to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:45.440
help her, she says he should help the rest of&nbsp;
the crew, because they're getting out of control.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.480
Christopher leaves and finds Zac along the way,&nbsp;
telling him to stay away from Sela, when they hear&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:55.360
the strange crackling noise again. He follows&nbsp;
it around the ship, as others can hear it too.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:55.920 --> 00:09:00.560
Kai sees Julie getting close to another crewman,&nbsp;
so he flies into a rage and punches him off her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:05.680
They fight. Later in the cantina,&nbsp;
Christopher tries to get the crew to behave,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:10.320
but they don't like it. Suddenly, the crewman&nbsp;
that Kai beat up starts hitting him with a tool.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:15.040
Christopher stops him by hitting him too.&nbsp;
He tells everyone to get Kai and the other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:19.200
one treated and then to meet at the common&nbsp;
room. In the meeting he tells everyone that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:23.840
the fighting has to stop and the reparations&nbsp;
have to continue. Zac challenges him and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:27.280
others think that they shouldn't be doing the work&nbsp;
because they won't get to the end of the mission.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:31.920
Christopher says that their grandchildren will&nbsp;
and that they need to support them. One of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:36.160
crewmembers says he doesn't want to work in&nbsp;
the systems room because the alien lives there.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:40.960
He thinks Christopher brought it in when Richard&nbsp;
died. Phoebe suggests they repair the surveillance&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:44.960
system and see what happened, but Zac belittles&nbsp;
her and tells Christopher to shut up too.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:49.360
He doesn't care about the rules anymore&nbsp;
and tries to get the others on his side,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:53.360
saying Christopher isn't the right leader.&nbsp;
Zac thinks he should be the leader and tries&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:57.280
to convince the rest of them to become a part of&nbsp;
his group, which will be strong enough to fight&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:02.240
the alien if it's there. Many of the crew follow&nbsp;
him, but some of them stay on Christopher's side.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:07.440
That group goes to the surveillance room to fix&nbsp;
the system, afraid the alien might be there.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:12.400
Christopher goes in first to check. Zac and the&nbsp;
others roam the hallways and reach the systems&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:18.080
room. Him and Kai go inside the room, not knowing&nbsp;
Christopher has been in there too. They go deeper&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:22.960
inside the room to look for the alien. The ones&nbsp;
on the outside see something happening inside,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:28.400
and Zac and Kai run out terrified, sealing the&nbsp;
room as they leave. Later, they tell the others&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:32.960
from the group that the alien attacked them.&nbsp;
Meanwhile, Christopher brings the surveillance&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:38.320
drive to Sela in the med bay. Him, her and a few&nbsp;
others check the footage. They find the footage&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:43.040
from the systems room and realize that it was Zac&nbsp;
and Kai that killed Richard by electrocuting him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:47.840
then lied about the alien. The group decides to&nbsp;
keep quiet for the moment, until they figure out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:53.280
what to do. Christopher and Sela hide the drive in&nbsp;
her room and talk about Zac. He thinks that this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:57.360
is what they're really like without the drug,&nbsp;
but she disagrees, saying that the two of them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:01.440
are different. He says that he's worried that&nbsp;
the others won't care about the truth and that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:06.560
maybe he doesn't care either. Sela tells him to&nbsp;
stay with her. They kiss and they sleep together.&nbsp;

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:12.720
In the morning, there's a knock on Sela's door.&nbsp;
It's Zac saying that he'll come inside, one way or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:17.920
another. When she and Christopher open the door,&nbsp;
Zac and Kai invite them to another celebration in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:23.440
the cantina. Christopher's group arrives, while&nbsp;
the others are already eating. Zac invites them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:28.560
to get some food. When they sit down, he stands&nbsp;
up and proclaims himself the new chief officer.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:33.920
Suddenly, Christopher stands up to, goes to a&nbsp;
monitor and plays the footage from the incident.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:37.680
He tells the others that Zac killed&nbsp;
Richard and that there is no alien,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:42.240
that he's been lying to them. He suggests&nbsp;
Zac confines himself in his room, while they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:47.760
consult the program and they decide what to do.&nbsp;
Everyone gets upset and Zac confesses, saying he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:52.400
did it to protect them, because the alien was&nbsp;
in Richard and Christopher brought it inside.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:56.240
He convinces the others that the alien is&nbsp;
inside the ship, hiding in one of them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:01.680
Zac says that they need to find it and kill it,&nbsp;
to which they all agree. He pits them against each&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:06.000
other and they start fighting. They think it's the&nbsp;
crewman that works in the med bay and they start&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:11.760
chasing after him. Christopher follows suit. Kai&nbsp;
hits him first, then the others join, as they kick&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:16.880
the crewman to death. Christopher takes his group&nbsp;
to a secure place in the ship, while Zac's group&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:21.440
goes into the med bay and they arm themselves.&nbsp;
Christopher's group tries to figure out what to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:25.360
do and some of them want to give up, saying they&nbsp;
can't do anything in the moment. They think they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:29.360
should join Zac's group and try to detain him&nbsp;
later, because his group has weapons and they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:33.680
don't. Sela realizes that Christopher knows&nbsp;
about the weapons hidden on the ship in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:39.440
secret compartment. Christopher goes to find it by&nbsp;
himself. He opens a compartment and crawls inside,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:44.480
searching for it. When he finally finds it,&nbsp;
he can't open it and an alarm starts blaring,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:49.200
which Julie and another crewman hear. They hear&nbsp;
him inside the compartments too and tell Zac&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:54.160
about it. Christopher gets out to get some tools&nbsp;
to open the compartment, but when he comes back,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:58.960
the other group is already taking the compartments&nbsp;
apart. They open the secret compartment and find&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:03.600
the weapons. Kai thinks they're meant for the&nbsp;
third generation, but Zac says they are for them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:07.120
Two people from Christopher's group&nbsp;
want to join Zac and the others.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:12.560
Zac asks where the rest are hiding. Sela,&nbsp;
Phoebe and Christopher devise a plan how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:17.280
to get close to Zac. He suggests that he&nbsp;
should kill him, but Phoebe doesn't like it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:20.720
Sela watches them on the monitor and sees&nbsp;
that they're moving, coming after them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:26.560
They cut their power and arrive at the room. Sela&nbsp;
tells her group not to resist, as the others storm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:31.840
the room and grab them. Sela stops them, as they&nbsp;
are dragging Christopher away, and asks to talk&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:37.280
privately to Zac. She says she wants to be with&nbsp;
him and join his group, as she walks up to him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:42.080
But he rejects her, laughing at her, when&nbsp;
Phoebe appears asking if they've all gone crazy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:46.480
She says they can decide not to act the way&nbsp;
they have. But they all tell her to shut up.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:52.000
Suddenly Kai kills her to the shock of everyone,&nbsp;
including Zac. But he turns it around and goes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.080
after Christopher. He and Sela escape, but&nbsp;
the others hunt for them throughout the ship.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:56.640 --> 00:14:02.560
They hide in a vent, but the others quickly find&nbsp;
which one it is. Zac shoots inside, as Julie tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:07.280
him to be careful, because he's destroying their&nbsp;
food supply. He sends one of his men after them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:12.400
to see if he got them, but they escape again.&nbsp;
Suddenly, someone shoots at them, so they start&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:17.360
looking for weapons. Christopher finds a fire&nbsp;
extinguisher and as Kai comes inside the med bay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:22.000
they incapacitate him and accidentally kill&nbsp;
him. Zac finds them fast and shoots after them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:27.280
as they run away. They get into an airlock and&nbsp;
Christopher tells Sela to get into a space suit.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:31.920
He covers the window of the air lock. When&nbsp;
Zac reaches it, he shoots without hesitation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:37.360
Suddenly he's sucked inside, because the hatch&nbsp;
to the outside has been opened. He grabs Sela&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:41.200
and goes to close the hatch, fighting with&nbsp;
her and eventually stabbing her with a knife.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:46.320
Christopher pushes him outside the hatch, but as&nbsp;
they fight, ends up sucked out in space himself.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:51.680
Before Zac can close the hatch, Sela kicks&nbsp;
him out of it. She searches for Christopher,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:55.680
waiting for him to come back and suddenly&nbsp;
sees him grabbing onto the ship. The two&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:55.680 --> 00:15:00.320
of them come back inside and tell the others&nbsp;
that Zac is gone. They put down their weapons.&nbsp;

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:06.320
Some time later, all of the crew is having lunch&nbsp;
in the cantina. Sela asks Christopher how they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:10.800
can make sure something like that doesn't happen&nbsp;
again. They listen to some of Richards recordings&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:15.120
again, in which he says that no matter what bad&nbsp;
happens on the mission, the ones that prevail&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:19.920
are proof that humans are worth saving. The crew&nbsp;
votes for a new chief again and they choose Sela.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:24.640
She records a diary in which she says that they&nbsp;
will vote for everything from that moment on and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:29.120
that they will still not go back to the blue.&nbsp;
The crew continues repairing the ship and work&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:34.560
together in peace as time goes by. Sela can be&nbsp;
seen pregnant and the baby is Christopher's.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:39.440
The baby is born. A few years later, it can&nbsp;
be seen running on the ship and joining other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:43.760
children. Those children grow up on the&nbsp;
ship, as the first generation grows old.&nbsp;

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:48.720
86 years since the start of the mission&nbsp;
the Humanitas can be seen floating in space&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:52.560
and engaging it's drive to land on the&nbsp;
planet. The older generations and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:55.200
younger ones look toward their&nbsp;
new home on the alien planet.
