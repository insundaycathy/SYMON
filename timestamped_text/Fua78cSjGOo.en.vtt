00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.160
Story Recapped here. Today,&nbsp;
I'm going to explain an action,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:09.280
adventure, sci-fi film called “Jumper.”&nbsp;
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.640
David Rice is a teenager living a normal life&nbsp;
in a small rural town. He talks to Millie,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:20.400
a classmate whom he’s attracted to. David gives&nbsp;
Mille a snowglobe as a gift, and Millie accepts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.520
it wholeheartedly. Another classmate,&nbsp;
Mark, intervenes and takes the gift away,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.080
teasing David. Their classmate then throws the&nbsp;
snowglobe into the middle of a frozen lake,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.640
and David attempts to retrieve it. Millie&nbsp;
tries to discourage him, but David continues.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.920
David gets to the snowglobe, but the ice gives&nbsp;
way, and he falls under. Millie runs to help,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.000
but David gets trapped under. The current&nbsp;
drags David farther, and there’s no chance&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.120
he can get back onto the surface. Suddenly, he&nbsp;
finds himself in the middle of the public library.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.800
David is completely disorientated and in complete&nbsp;
confusion and shock but tries to walk out of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.840
library without arousing suspicion. David heads&nbsp;
home, and his father, William, notes that he’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.760
late. David lives alone with his father,&nbsp;
as his mother left him when he was a child.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.840
William asks where David had&nbsp;
been, but he doesn’t answer.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:13.120
William gets angry and chases David into his room.&nbsp;
David locks his room, but William tries to force&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:18.160
himself in. Just as William bursts in, David&nbsp;
disappears and reappears in the library again.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.760
David realizes that his newfound ability could&nbsp;
be the key to a better life. He goes home and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:28.480
takes out some money he’s saved. He decides&nbsp;
to move to a bigger city and start a new life.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.040
David then tries to learn more about&nbsp;
his abilities by practicing at a park,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.800
seeing if he can get better control of&nbsp;
his powers. He looks through a tourist&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.840
magazine and sees different tourist&nbsp;
attraction sites all over the world,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.560
trying to teleport to those places. He sees&nbsp;
the Empire State Building and remembers being&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.680
there with his mother, Mary. Things in his room&nbsp;
suddenly start flying around, and he teleports&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.800
to the Empire State building. David then realizes&nbsp;
that he can only teleport to places he’s been to.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.480
With no money, David decides to use his powers&nbsp;
to steal from a bank. He goes to a bank and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.400
asks to use the bathroom, and as he makes his&nbsp;
way, he gets a glimpse of the interior of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.040
bank’s vault. That evening, David teleports into&nbsp;
the vault and takes as much money as he can.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.640
He makes several trips, filling&nbsp;
up his bag with each return.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.560
The following day, an investigation into the bank&nbsp;
robbery begins. Roland Cox appears and tells the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.160
bank manager he works for the government.&nbsp;
He then requests all video surveillance&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.680
footage and the names of every person who&nbsp;
has entered the bank in the past month.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.600
Roland notes that the bank vault had never&nbsp;
been opened, and authorities have no idea&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.200
how the robbery was performed. Roland&nbsp;
appears to have knowledge of people who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.880
can teleport and theorizes that the theft&nbsp;
could have been committed by one of them.

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.840
Several years pass, and David now lives in&nbsp;
downtown New York at a penthouse apartment.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.440
David lives in excess, having everything&nbsp;
he needs and doing whatever he wants.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.520
His apartment is filled with pictures&nbsp;
of different locations around the world,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.120
and he even has a secret room where he&nbsp;
keeps currencies from different countries.

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.520
David then teleports to a bar in&nbsp;
London, spotting a beautiful woman.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.440
He teleports to her without caution,&nbsp;
and another person, Griffin,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.080
sees him teleporting. He spends a night with&nbsp;
the girl, and the following day, he heads out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:11.120
to Fiji to surf massive waves. He then heads&nbsp;
to Egypt, having lunch on top of the Sphinx.

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.320
In a tropical jungle, a man teleports,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.960
trying to escape. He teleports through the&nbsp;
wilderness, but a cable is attached to him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.520
rendering him unable to leave. He gets stuck in a&nbsp;
tree, tangled in electrified wires. Roland appears&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:26.240
and walks up to him. The teleporter asks why&nbsp;
Roland has done this to him, and Roland tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:31.200
him that people who can teleport are abominations&nbsp;
and must be exterminated. He then stabs the man,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.760
killing him. Roland then gets a phone call about&nbsp;
the robbery that occurred several years back.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.000
David arrives back in New York at his&nbsp;
apartment and discovers Roland is there.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.120
Roland tells David he’s investigating a&nbsp;
bank robbery, but he’s not from the police.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:50.160
David asks Roland to leave, but Roland&nbsp;
instead takes a baton and electrocutes David.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:55.280
David tries teleporting away but struggles to&nbsp;
get farther than a few meters. Roland runs up,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:00.320
electrocuting David again and throwing him off&nbsp;
a ledge. Roland then shoots a cable, attaching&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:05.760
his baton to David. Roland attaches his baton&nbsp;
to the floor, and this anchors David, disabling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.480
him from teleporting too far. David desperately&nbsp;
tries to escape, teleporting to a hidden room&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.280
in the wall and managing to cut off the cable.&nbsp;
David takes several bags of money and disappears.

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:18.720
He reappears back in his&nbsp;
father’s house in his old room.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.520
William hears David arriving and rushes&nbsp;
to him. William begs David to stay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.800
telling David that he’s been unsure if&nbsp;
he’s going crazy on account of his son&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.920
disappearing. David then tells William he’s&nbsp;
not going crazy but disappears just as quickly.

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.360
The next day, David looks for Millie&nbsp;
and finds her working at a local bar.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:39.840
He then runs into his old school&nbsp;
bully, Mark, and they get into a brawl.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.440
David then ends up teleporting Mark&nbsp;
into a bank vault and leaving him there.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:49.200
David returns to Millie, and the two catch up.&nbsp;
David tells Millie that he’s now in a banking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.920
profession and asks Millie how she’s doing in&nbsp;
the small town. Millie says she still dreams of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:58.960
traveling the world, and David offers her a trip&nbsp;
to Rome with him. Millie is ecstatic hearing this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.200
and tells David she’d love to go with him.&nbsp;
Behind them, Griffin is watching closely.

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:08.560
A few hours later, David and Millie are&nbsp;
in Rome, going to see the Colosseum.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.840
Meanwhile, Roland pretends to&nbsp;
work for the CIA to get to Mark,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:15.840
who’s at a police station. He asks him&nbsp;
about what happened to him in the bank,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.040
and Roland learns of Millie and finds&nbsp;
that she had just arrived in Rome.

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.480
In Rome, David and Millie are at an apartment&nbsp;
having a conversation about their lives and how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:29.120
they’d both hold out for the last couple of years.&nbsp;
David and Millie then get romantic and share an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:34.400
intimate moment, kissing passionately. Later that&nbsp;
day, David sneaks Millie into the Colosseum, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:39.360
they explore around, avoiding guards. David then&nbsp;
separates from Millie to open a locked door and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:44.480
finally runs into Griffin. Griffin reveals himself&nbsp;
to be another person who can teleport, referring&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:48.960
to himself and others like him as jumpers.&nbsp;
Griffin calls David out for his lavish and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:53.440
carefree lifestyle and tells him that a group of&nbsp;
people called paladins are determined to kill all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:59.120
jumpers. Just as he explains, a pair of paladins&nbsp;
appear. The paladins approach and take out their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:04.960
batons, and a fight breaks out. David tries to run&nbsp;
but gets snagged by one of the electrified cables.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:09.840
His teleport ability is again disabled. Griffin&nbsp;
then proceeds to fight the two Paladins, quickly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:15.120
overpowering them. He disables both pursuers and&nbsp;
tells David that he’s been killing paladins for a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:20.400
long time. He then teleports away to his secret&nbsp;
lair. David sees a residue, called a jump scar,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:24.640
from Griffin’s jump and follows. Griffin&nbsp;
warns him off, and David returns to Millie.

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:28.800
David then now takes Millie away,&nbsp;
leading her out of the Colosseum,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:33.600
but Millie demands an explanation for what is&nbsp;
happening. Before David could start explaining,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:38.640
the police arrive and arrest David for breaking&nbsp;
into the Colosseum. At the police station,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:43.520
David is questioned but maintains that he’s only&nbsp;
a tourist who violated rules and is sorry for it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:48.160
The officers then leave David, telling him to&nbsp;
wait for the magistrate from the U.S. embassy.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:53.920
As David waits, a woman enters, and David&nbsp;
recognizes it to be Mary, his mother. Mary&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:58.160
tells David he only has thirty seconds before&nbsp;
more paladins arrive and hands him a key to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:04.080
his handcuffs. Mary hurries back out, and David&nbsp;
chases after her, but he loses her. David then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:09.200
meets back up with Millie, and the two head for&nbsp;
the airport. At the airport, David tells Millie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:13.760
that they have to separate. Millie is disappointed&nbsp;
to hear this but proceeds with her flight alone.

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:18.480
Meanwhile, Roland arrives at William’s house&nbsp;
and introduces himself as part of the IRS.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:22.640
Roland asks about David, but William&nbsp;
is unwelcoming and uncooperative.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:27.840
William tells Roland that he hasn’t seen David&nbsp;
for eight years. He also mentions how Mary left&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:32.720
him and David when David turned five. William&nbsp;
asks Roland to leave, but Roland refuses.

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:37.120
David arrives at Griffin’s hideout and&nbsp;
sees Griffin’s walls full of pictures&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:39.760
and information about paladins around the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:43.680
David asks Griffin for an explanation&nbsp;
as to why paladins are killing jumpers,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:48.640
and Griffin explains that the war has been going&nbsp;
on since the dark ages. According to Griffin, the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:53.440
paladins are religious fanatics who believe that&nbsp;
the power to teleport should only lie with God.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:57.680
He then tells David that paladins won’t&nbsp;
hesitate to kill anyone just to get to David.

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:01.760
Realizing his father and Millie could be in&nbsp;
trouble, David teleports to William and finds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:06.720
him unconscious on the floor. He teleports them&nbsp;
to a hospital, and medical personnel rush to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:11.600
help William. David returns to Griffin’s hideout&nbsp;
wanting to get more information on Roland as he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:16.720
intends to kill him. Griffin says it’s useless as&nbsp;
he’s been tracking Roland for more than ten years,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:19.680
and with each encounter, Griffin&nbsp;
only comes out with more scars.

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:25.520
David offers to help catch Roland, but Griffin&nbsp;
turns him down. Griffin then teleports to China,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:29.360
but David follows, still trying to&nbsp;
convince Griffin to let him help.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:32.720
Griffin finally agrees when David tells&nbsp;
him that he knows where Roland could&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:35.200
potentially turn up next, pertaining to Millie.

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:38.640
They decide to split up; David would&nbsp;
get Millie while Griffin heads back to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:43.760
the hideout to arm himself. David arrives at&nbsp;
Millie’s apartment. Millie is surprised to see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:47.760
David again and tells him that she doesn’t&nbsp;
want to be associated with him anymore.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:52.080
Millie tells David to leave, but David&nbsp;
hears Roland and a few more men arriving.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:56.160
With no other choice, David has to tell&nbsp;
Millie the truth, revealing himself as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:00.880
a jumper. Millie is dumbfounded to witness&nbsp;
David’s powers and freaks out, running away.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:05.840
Knowing danger is upon them, David grabs her&nbsp;
and teleports them both to Griffin’s hideout.

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:11.120
Roland and the other paladins enter Millie’s&nbsp;
apartment and see it empty, but Roland finds a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:17.120
jump scar. They take out a contraption, setting it&nbsp;
below the jump scar, and a portal starts forming.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:20.480
They’re attempting to reopen the jump&nbsp;
scar so that they can follow David.

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:24.720
David meets with Griffin, but Griffin is&nbsp;
outraged seeing Millie there with them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:27.520
Griffin tells David about the&nbsp;
paladins’ machine and says&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:30.800
bringing Millie to the hideout would&nbsp;
only lead the paladins right to them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:36.240
David and Griffin check on the jump scar and see&nbsp;
it getting larger. Seconds later, Roland appears.

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:41.760
David and Griffin hide, but as David hides,&nbsp;
he sees a picture of Mary on Griffin’s wall&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:46.480
of known paladins. David then gets tagged with&nbsp;
an electrified cable and is pinned to a wall.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:51.280
Griffin comes in carrying a flamethrower.&nbsp;
Griffin and Roland then get into a fight&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:54.400
with Griffin using his teleporting&nbsp;
abilities to gain the upper hand.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:54.960 --> 00:10:00.480
Roland also puts up a good fight, utilizing the&nbsp;
paladins’ technology. Griffin punches Roland out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:05.200
of the hideout and teleports away but returning&nbsp;
with a running bus aimed directly at Roland.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:09.440
Roland has little time to react but&nbsp;
still manages to dodge the oncoming bus.

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:12.720
Millie finds David stuck to a wall,&nbsp;
and she tries to get him free,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:17.520
but Roland appears ready to kill her. Millie&nbsp;
stands frozen, but Griffin appears again with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:21.200
the flamethrower and blasts Roland back&nbsp;
into the jump scar. Griffin jumps in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:26.240
after him. Roland and Griffin reappear back in&nbsp;
Millie’s apartment, and the fight continues.

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:30.640
Back in the hideout, Millie successfully frees&nbsp;
David but tells him that she wants to go home.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:35.200
She doesn’t want to be involved in anything that’s&nbsp;
happening and just wants to get back to her normal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:41.120
life. David is left with no choice and agrees. As&nbsp;
he prepares to take Millie back, Griffin reappears&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:46.240
successfully, carrying the paladins’ jump scar&nbsp;
opener. But with the jump scar still active,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:50.720
the paladins still manage to launch a cable and&nbsp;
captures Millie, taking her back to the apartment.

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:56.080
David wants to rescue Millie, but Griffin&nbsp;
prepares a bomb. David is confused,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:56.080 --> 00:11:00.880
but Griffin tells him that this is his chance to&nbsp;
end the paladins once and for all. He intends to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:05.120
teleport to the apartment with the bomb. David&nbsp;
protests and teleports away with the bomb.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:09.920
Griffin chases after him, and the two end up&nbsp;
fighting, teleporting through many different&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:15.200
locations. They teleport to Egypt, San&nbsp;
Francisco, New York, all while fighting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:19.920
for the bomb’s remote detonator. They end up&nbsp;
in a war-torn country, and Griffin finally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:24.160
gets the detonator. But Griffin doesn’t&nbsp;
see that a pylon is falling on top of them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:29.680
David teleports Griffin into the pylon, letting&nbsp;
the massive amount of electricity capture Griffin,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:34.640
pinning him down. Griffin tries to discourage&nbsp;
David into returning to the apartment, saying he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:38.880
won’t stand a chance against five paladins,&nbsp;
but David is determined to rescue Millie.

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:42.480
David returns to the apartment and gets&nbsp;
to Millie but is immediately stung by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:47.120
five electrified cables that the paladins&nbsp;
anchor to the apartment. David struggles,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:52.640
still focusing on teleporting away. This&nbsp;
causes the entire apartment to shake violently.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:56.960
With the wires attached to David and the&nbsp;
apartment, every time David tries to teleport,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:56.960 --> 00:12:01.280
the apartment also goes with him. He grunts and&nbsp;
shouts, and the apartment walls jolt and crack.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:05.360
Finally, with one last push, he teleports the&nbsp;
entire apartment back to the lake, where he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:10.800
discovered his abilities. Most of the paladins are&nbsp;
disabled, and some of them drown, and David then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:15.840
teleports the apartment back to the library. David&nbsp;
regains consciousness and sees that Roland is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:20.960
still alive. David then takes Roland and abandons&nbsp;
him somewhere in the middle of the Grand Canyon.

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:26.320
Time passes, and David locates his&nbsp;
mother. Mary’s daughter answers the door,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:31.200
and David and Mary finally talk. Mary&nbsp;
explains that she’s also a paladin.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:35.440
When David teleported for the first time&nbsp;
at the age of five, Mary made the difficult&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:39.920
decision to leave him to protect him from the&nbsp;
other paladins. Now that they’ve reunited,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:44.000
David asks what would happen. Mary then&nbsp;
answers that she would give him a head start.

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:47.120
David then returns to Millie&nbsp;
waiting for him outside.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:50.640
The two hold hands, smile at&nbsp;
each other and teleport away.
