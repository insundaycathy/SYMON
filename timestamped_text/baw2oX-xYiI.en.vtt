00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.160
Story Recapped here. Today, I'm going&nbsp;
to explain a sci-fi film called "Push."&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.200
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:12.080
As a young boy, Nick Gant has been told by&nbsp;
his father to help a girl who will give him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.080
a flower in the future. His father, who can&nbsp;
control things telekinetically, has been on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.400
the run from Division. The shadowy organization&nbsp;
has been set up after World War 2 to track down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.480
humans with extraordinary abilities so that they&nbsp;
could use their power for military purposes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.840
His father explains that helping the girl&nbsp;
would also help other people like them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.600
As operatives from Division arrive at the&nbsp;
hotel, his father advises him against making&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.600
any decisions that can be tracked by watchers,&nbsp;
who are capable of seeing the future. Before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.360
the team could raid the room, his father shoves&nbsp;
him telekinetically to another room to hide him.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.720
Henry Carver, who’s leading the team, arrives and&nbsp;
signals the operatives to go ahead with the raid.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.880
Nick hides in another room and watches the&nbsp;
assault. Not long after the team enters&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:53.520
the hotel room, he hears multiple gunshots and&nbsp;
witnesses two operatives, one disguised as a maid,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.760
thrown against the wall. Carver emerges from the&nbsp;
room, telling his men to bring the body of Nick's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.240
father back to their lab. Nick cries in silence&nbsp;
for his father as he watches Carver walk away.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.600
Ten years later, Carver watches&nbsp;
a girl named Kira Hudson&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.240
as she gets injected with a drug that would boost&nbsp;
her powers but could also potentially kill her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.320
Somewhere in the facility, a woman drops a glass&nbsp;
marble on the floor as nurses lead her to a room.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.320
Soon after the injection, Kira starts&nbsp;
having a seizure and ultimately flatlines.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.280
When the doctor moves closer to inspect Kira,&nbsp;
she suddenly opens her eyes and attacks him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.800
She takes the doctor's security pass and grabs a&nbsp;
syringe from the tray before running out of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.800
room. One of the doctors sounds the alarm,&nbsp;
causing the doors at the facility to close&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.360
and lock automatically. As Kira runs toward the&nbsp;
exit, the glass marble rolls along the hallway,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.720
leading to the door. Before the door&nbsp;
could close, the marble jams it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.240
allowing Kira to leave the facility.&nbsp;
Carver asks his right-hand man,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.960
Victor, to alert all the sniffers, who track&nbsp;
down people with the object they once touched.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.640
In Hong Kong, Nick wakes up in his apartment&nbsp;
practicing his power as a Mover to control the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.280
dice telekinetically. He then goes to the park,&nbsp;
intent on using his superhuman power to cheat on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.400
a dice game, but he fails to control the last&nbsp;
die. Nick, who now owes $6,000 to the dealer,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.120
is beaten up and chased across the&nbsp;
park due to the debt he has incurred.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.960
When he gets back home, two sniffs from&nbsp;
Division wait for him at the apartment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.000
to ask him about a girl who had stolen&nbsp;
something that belongs to the organization.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.520
After learning that Nick has been alone in the&nbsp;
apartment for a while, the agents leave him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.080
but they warn him not to bother running&nbsp;
because they'll track him down again.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.880
Nick starts packing his clothes and grabs his gun,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.800
but he soon receives a strange call telling&nbsp;
him to open his door and put his weapon down.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.600
When he opens it, Cassie, a 13-year-old&nbsp;
watcher, barges into the room and heads&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.560
straight to the refrigerator to take&nbsp;
the chicken that she saw in her vision.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.240
Cassie then introduces herself and tells Nick&nbsp;
that she's there to help him find $6 million.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.680
Cassie discloses that she's a second-generation&nbsp;
watcher, and she can see glimpses of the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.480
However, she admits that she's&nbsp;
not very good with her abilities,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.840
and she can get things wrong sometimes.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.320
Cassie claims that the money is in a suitcase&nbsp;
carried by the girl being hunted down by Division.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.040
Nick, however, tells Cassie&nbsp;
that he doesn't want to get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.280
involved with Division even if the money is real.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.360
Despite Nick's reluctance, Cassie is confident&nbsp;
that he is going to help one way or another.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.720
Cassie contends that terrible things will happen&nbsp;
if they don't find the girl and the suitcase.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.360
Cassie suddenly gets a vision and tells Nick that&nbsp;
there are people after her in the market. As they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.400
flee, they come across the gang known as the Pop&nbsp;
family. The Pop Father asks Nick about the girl on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.560
the run from Division, saying his watcher daughter&nbsp;
had already seen Nick with her. The Pop Daughter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.760
points a gun at Cassie, telling her that she&nbsp;
already knows how she dies. Cassie, confident that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.600
she wouldn't die at that moment, throws Nick's&nbsp;
gun at her. Nick sends the Pop Father and his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.760
henchman flying to the wall and runs away with&nbsp;
Cassie. A pair of bleeders, known for emitting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.160
an ear-splitting noise, scream at them, causing&nbsp;
anything made of glass around the block to break.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.920
Pop Girl soon gets a vision of them running to&nbsp;
the big fish tanks, so she tells the bleeders to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.680
intercept them there. The aquariums break from&nbsp;
the bleeders' screams, causing Cassie and Nick&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.720
to slip. Nick tells Cassie to run as a bleeder&nbsp;
screams at him. Not long after, Pop Girl gets a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.040
vision of Nick with Kira and Cassie, but she also&nbsp;
sees Kira disappearing when she's on her own.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.080
So she points out to her father that&nbsp;
they'll lose the girl if they kill Nick.

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.440
At the pier, Kira wakes up on a&nbsp;
boat, not knowing where she is.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.200
A man smoking a pipe ignores her as she&nbsp;
looks around the boat. Inside the cabin,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.240
she sees "4100" and "Nick"&nbsp;
written on a mirror with lipstick,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.440
so she takes her lipstick and writes down&nbsp;
"Nick" and learns that the handwriting matches.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.080
That night, Cassie looks for Nick with the help&nbsp;
of her powers. As she wanders around the city,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:14.640
she learns that Nick is in the care of a stitch&nbsp;
named Teresa, who can mend damaged tissue.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.800
Teresa heals Nick, saying she's only doing&nbsp;
it because she owes Cassie's mother a favor.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:22.640
After Teresa leaves, Cassie gives Nick a&nbsp;
Lotus. She reveals that Division locked&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.640
up her mother because they're&nbsp;
afraid they can't control her.

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.840
Cassie shows Nick a drawing of her vision, showing&nbsp;
a woman being taken by Division agents. She warns&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.760
that the agents that visited his apartment earlier&nbsp;
will soon capture the girl with the suitcase.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.360
As they prepare to leave, Cassie shows him&nbsp;
another drawing depicting their dead bodies,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.360
telling him that they'll both&nbsp;
die in pursuit of the woman.

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.720
As Cassie had foretold, Agents Mack and&nbsp;
Holden catch up to Kira on the streets.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.000
On their way to the airport, they stop&nbsp;
by a cafe to let Kira use the toilet.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.120
Inside a bathroom stall, Kira uses her ability&nbsp;
as a pusher to inject a false memory into Mack's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:57.680
mind, telling him that he has a brother who Holden&nbsp;
killed. Mack furiously exits the toilet and shoots&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:02.640
Holden in the back. When he realizes what he's&nbsp;
done, he runs back to the bathroom to find Kira.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:05.760
When she emerges, she splashes soap&nbsp;
in his eyes and tries running away,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.760
but Mack catches her. During the scuffle,&nbsp;
Mack pulls out the beads on her bracelet.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:13.760
She scratches the back of his head and beats&nbsp;
him with a portable bathroom sign. She finally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:17.280
knocks Mack unconscious with a kick to the head&nbsp;
and leaves the toilet with his car keys and gun.

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:22.240
While riding the taxi with Cassie, Nick&nbsp;
practices his powers by lifting her sketch pad.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.640
When he sees a drawing of a cocktail glass, he&nbsp;
tells the driver to go to a place called "Club B."&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:30.560
He notices a round object outside the glass,&nbsp;
thinking it's an olive, but Cassie tells him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:33.760
that it's a bead. Nick suggests looking&nbsp;
for the bead to see where it takes them.

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:38.000
Meanwhile, Mack gives Kira’s beads to Carver,&nbsp;
telling him that he remembers everything about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.640
his supposed brother, but Carver&nbsp;
reminds him that he never had one.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.080
Carver orders Mack to go home,&nbsp;
saying he's relieved of his duties,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:47.360
but Mack assures him that he'll never let&nbsp;
Kira push false memories into him again.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:51.200
Carver urges Mack to put a gun in his mouth&nbsp;
and pull the trigger if he's willing to bet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:55.280
his life on it. Carver tells him not to worry as&nbsp;
he inserts a false memory that Mack had already&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:59.520
unloaded his firearm earlier. Mack puts the gun&nbsp;
into his mouth and shoots himself as Carver and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.960
Victor walk through the alley without any&nbsp;
concern for the dead agent. Carver tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.560
Victor to spread Kira's beads to every sniff&nbsp;
and watcher in the city until they find Kira.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:10.800
When Nick and Cassie arrive at Club B, they&nbsp;
meet up with a shifter named Hook Waters,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:15.200
who can morph objects. They ask Hook to&nbsp;
shift an object into a bead so they could&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:18.880
use it to track down the suitcase. After&nbsp;
transforming an earring into a shiny bead,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.880
Hook tells them to take it to a sniff named Emily.

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:25.760
Upon their arrival at Emily's place, they&nbsp;
show her the bead that Hook shifted for them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:30.000
but they learn that she already has one of the&nbsp;
real beads distributed by Division. After sniffing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.520
the object, Emily tells them that they'll find&nbsp;
the girl they're looking for in Kwun Tong Pier.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:38.000
At the pier, Kira uses her ability to&nbsp;
convince a couple to give her a ride.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.760
But before she could get in the car, she hears&nbsp;
Cassie and Nick arriving, so she fires her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:46.000
gun at them. Nick recognizes Kira and asks if&nbsp;
she's the woman who Division is hunting down.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:50.080
However, Kira is angry at Nick for not&nbsp;
searching for her when Division captured her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:52.560
but Nick thought she left him because&nbsp;
she stopped returning his calls.

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:56.960
While walking along the streets, Kira stresses&nbsp;
that Division is looking for the suitcase,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:00.640
but she doesn't know what's inside it. She&nbsp;
discloses that she doesn't remember anything&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:04.000
that happened in the past few days. Nick&nbsp;
surmised that she had her memories wiped&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.400
to make it harder for Division to find her. Kira&nbsp;
notes that her memories of Nick are still intact.

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:11.680
Cassie takes Nick aside to tell him that something&nbsp;
has changed in the future because her mother&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:15.440
is now with them in her vision of their death.&nbsp;
She asks Nick to get rid of Kira because she's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:19.120
making the future worse and she doesn't have the&nbsp;
suitcase, but Nick argues that they'll soon find&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:23.040
the case with her. Cassie worries that Division&nbsp;
will eventually capture Kira and take them along&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:27.040
with her, so Nick suggests bringing a shadow&nbsp;
to block the sniffers from tracking her down.

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:30.320
Later that night, they meet up&nbsp;
with a shadow named Pinky Stein,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:34.000
who asks for $10,000 a day for his&nbsp;
services. He assures them that sniffs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.520
won't be able to track Kira down as long&nbsp;
as she's standing within 20 feet of him.

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:41.600
The three check into a motel as they wait for&nbsp;
Kira to remember the location of the suitcase.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:44.880
When Cassie goes outside to get something&nbsp;
to eat, Pinky leaves the room too,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:48.400
sensing that Nick needs to be alone with&nbsp;
Kira. Nick lingers around the room until&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:51.760
Kira pushes him to make him think that&nbsp;
the bathroom is on fire. When he learns&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:55.440
that Kira wanted him to go inside, Nick shuts&nbsp;
the bathroom door as they begin to make love.

00:07:56.240 --> 00:08:00.720
Outside the hotel, Pop Girl approaches Cassie to&nbsp;
remind her that she knows how Cassie will die.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:03.600
She flips her sketchbook showing her&nbsp;
several drawings of a tiger and hints&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:06.160
that Cassie can still change&nbsp;
her fate by leaving Hong Kong.

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:10.320
When she gets back to the motel room, Cassie warns&nbsp;
Nick that Kira will get them all killed, including&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:14.480
Pinky. When she mentions the watcher, Pinky&nbsp;
warns them that watchers can still track them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:18.400
and it will only be a matter of time before they&nbsp;
catch up. Nick suggests splitting up the group to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:22.240
throw off the people chasing after them. He tells&nbsp;
Kira to go with Pinky, promising her that he'll&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:26.800
find her soon. Cassie is passed out from drinking&nbsp;
alcohol, so they let her sleep, but she soon&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:31.680
wakes up from a vision. Later on, Pop Girl and the&nbsp;
bleeders arrive at the room, but no one is there.

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:36.080
After sending Kira off with Pinky, Nick&nbsp;
asks Emily to track down Carver using&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:39.920
the bead she got from Division. Nick finds&nbsp;
Carver at a restaurant and telekinetically&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:43.360
points a gun at him and Victor as he&nbsp;
confronts them. Carver taunts Nick,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:46.560
saying he learned from the numerous watchers&nbsp;
he employs that Nick and his friends will die.

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:51.280
Carver warns him that Kira will die soon without&nbsp;
another injection, and Division is the only place&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:56.000
she can get it. As Carver continues to taunt him,&nbsp;
Nick's control of the guns starts to get weaker.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.200
Victor soon manifests his ability as a&nbsp;
mover and wrests control of Nick's gun.

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:04.080
Nick swiftly moves the table to pin down Victor&nbsp;
to the wall. He then grabs a gun and runs away&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:08.720
as Victor shoots him. He slides on the floor,&nbsp;
firing at Victor, but Victor manages to block&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:12.480
each bullet. Nick floats the gun toward&nbsp;
Victor as they hide from each other. As&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:16.560
Nick fires the weapon at Victor, a firearm&nbsp;
is also slowly heading in Nick's direction.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:20.640
Victor's gun soon reaches him, but it is&nbsp;
out of bullets. When Nick tries to run,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:23.920
Victor knocks him down by hitting his head&nbsp;
with the firearm and tripping him with a chair.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:28.160
Victor throws Nick around the room,&nbsp;
slamming him against the walls and ceiling.

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:33.200
Carver gets out of the restaurant and finds Cassie&nbsp;
drawing on her sketchpad. Cassie begs Carver not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:36.720
to make her do anything to herself, but Carver&nbsp;
is not interested in hurting her because it will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:40.880
change the future, and he already likes it the way&nbsp;
it is. Cassie warns him that killing Nick would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:44.880
also change their fate, so Carver goes back inside&nbsp;
the restaurant to stop Victor from hurting Nick.

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:49.200
When they go back to the hotel, Nick&nbsp;
learns that Kira is starting to get sick.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:52.240
Nick lies by Kira's side and&nbsp;
asks her what is in the suitcase.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:55.520
Kira discloses that it's a psychic&nbsp;
steroid that will boost their abilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:58.800
Division wants her back because she's the&nbsp;
only one who managed to survive the injection.

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:03.200
Cassie draws a picture of herself holding&nbsp;
Kira's shoe, so she comes inside the room and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:07.680
shows it to Nick. When she inspects it, she&nbsp;
finds a key to a locker. Kira's condition&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:11.520
suddenly worsens, so they immediately go to&nbsp;
Emily's place to find out what the key unlocks.

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:13.520
Kira warns the group that Pop Girl will soon find&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:15.360
out what they'll do because&nbsp;
she sees their intentions.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:18.880
Nick tries to think of a plan that would keep&nbsp;
the watcher from knowing about their plans.

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:23.840
Emily finds out that the locker is being shadowed.&nbsp;
Cassie realizes that she wouldn't be able to draw&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:28.080
the object if it's hidden. So she sketches on her&nbsp;
pad and learns that an entire building is being&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:32.400
shadowed to hide it from watchers. Meanwhile, Pop&nbsp;
Girl meets up with Teresa to ask for her help.

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:36.640
Nick notes that people keep dying in Cassie's&nbsp;
visions because Division and the Pop Family&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:40.080
track their every move. Nick asserts that&nbsp;
they'll make the future unpredictable by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:43.600
not knowing their plans before they do it.&nbsp;
Nick announces that he'll be writing letters&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:46.800
giving each of the instructions, but they&nbsp;
should only read it at the right moment.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:50.080
The last letter he writes will be&nbsp;
for himself. He asks Pinky to find&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:53.040
the man who wiped Kira's memory, so he&nbsp;
could forget about writing the letters.

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:58.400
Afterward, Nick asks Cassie to draw the exact&nbsp;
size and shape of the suitcase and the syringe.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:01.440
Elsewhere, Pop Girl also comes up&nbsp;
with her sketch of the objects.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:05.360
While Emily is sniffing the key, she discovers&nbsp;
that a tape is covering the locker number.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:09.440
After finishing the drawings, Pop Girl, eager to&nbsp;
please her father, tells him that the Division&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:14.080
is looking for a syringe. She surmises that the&nbsp;
drug will make them more powerful than Division.

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:16.720
Nick tells Kira that she needs the&nbsp;
medicine from Carver, knowing that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:20.480
they can't get it anywhere else. He gives&nbsp;
Kira a red envelope and tells her that she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:24.240
should open it when she starts doubting the&nbsp;
truth. After sending Kira off with Pinky,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:28.000
Nick distributes the remaining&nbsp;
envelopes to Emily, Cassie, and Hook.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.760
After taking Kira to Carver, Pinky opens his&nbsp;
envelope and meets up with Nick to let him know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:36.640
the location of Wo Chiang, the man who wiped&nbsp;
Kira's memory. Nick asks Wo Chiang to erase&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:40.240
his memory of the last two hours so that he would&nbsp;
forget writing letters to his friends and himself.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:43.520
Nick drops money on the table and tells&nbsp;
him to open a letter when he's done.

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:47.680
When the clock hits 7:35, the&nbsp;
group starts reading the letters.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:51.040
Nick asks Wo Chiang to go ahead&nbsp;
with the memory wipe. Not long,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:54.800
Pop Girl loses her vision of Nick's future.&nbsp;
Hook goes into the shadowed building,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:58.640
posing as a safety inspector. He heads to&nbsp;
the lockers and opens the red envelope,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:03.520
which tells him that the particular locker he's&nbsp;
looking for is 4100. As he opens it, an elderly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:07.680
woman fires a gun at him. Hook informs her that&nbsp;
she doesn't have to shadow the building anymore,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:12.080
noting that Kira sent him. After taking a suitcase&nbsp;
from the locker, Hook heads back to the motel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:16.000
room. He then shifts another suitcase to match&nbsp;
the color of the one he took from the locker.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.600
Cassie brings a suitcase to Nick's apartment&nbsp;
and takes out Nick's guns from the drawer.

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:23.040
After Nick wakes up from the memory wipe, he&nbsp;
opens the envelope telling him to go home.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:27.680
When he reaches the apartment, he finds the&nbsp;
suitcase inside, but Teresa attacks him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:32.000
After looking at the contents of the suitcase,&nbsp;
she gives it to the Pop bleeders. A bleeder tries&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.640
to scream at Nick, but Teresa stops him, saying&nbsp;
their sister promised that Nick would die slowly.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:40.480
Meanwhile, Nick sees the guns stashed by Cassie&nbsp;
and telekinetically points them at Teresa,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:44.720
asking her to heal him. When they deliver the&nbsp;
suitcase to Pop Father, he finds the syringe,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:48.320
but it changes to a bottle of soy sauce as&nbsp;
soon as he hands it over to their client.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:51.920
Pop Girl tells her bleeder brothers&nbsp;
that the real syringe is in a building.

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:55.200
Meanwhile, Carver tries to give Kira an&nbsp;
immunosuppressant that will save her life.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:55.760 --> 00:13:00.400
Kira, however, resists the injection, so Carver&nbsp;
assures her that they're not trying to hurt her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:04.080
Carver claims that Kira is actually a Division&nbsp;
agent, and she volunteered to be injected with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:07.920
the drug. Carver shows Kira her I.D. at&nbsp;
the organization and points out that she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:12.160
only eluded them because of her training. Carver&nbsp;
uses his ability, claiming to help her remember.

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:17.040
Cassie still worries about her supposed impending&nbsp;
death, so Nick advises her to start walking and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:20.960
not think about where she's going so watchers&nbsp;
can't keep track of her. Nick tells Cassie to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:25.200
hide once she comes across a safe place. Cassie&nbsp;
goes to the subway and arrives at an intersection.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:29.760
Then, she covers her eyes and spins before&nbsp;
she continues walking in an unknown direction.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:34.000
With Pop Girl tracking her every movement, Cassie&nbsp;
ends up in an attic of a Chinese restaurant.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000
She sees boxes with a tiger logo and looks at her&nbsp;
own drawing depicting herself being attacked by a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.560
tiger. Soon, Pop Girl arrives, pointing a gun at&nbsp;
her and complaining that Cassie made her look like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:47.680
a fool in front of her family. Suddenly, Wo Chiang&nbsp;
appears behind Pop Girl and wipes her memory.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:50.960
As she leaves the attic, Wo Chiang tells&nbsp;
Cassie that her mother is proud of her.

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:55.360
Nick calls Carver to make a deal with him,&nbsp;
saying he'll surrender the drug for Kira.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:59.680
When he goes to the meeting place, he sees Kira&nbsp;
in good health, asking him for the suitcase.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:03.120
Kira reminds Nick of the first time he told&nbsp;
Kira he loves her, but she claims that it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:07.600
was a planted memory. Kira claims that they met&nbsp;
for the first time the previous day. Although&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:11.200
Nick remembers running cons with her at Coney&nbsp;
Island, Kira asserts that he's never been there.

00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:15.760
Nick soon receives a call from Hook, telling&nbsp;
Nick that he should take the drug. Hook then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:18.960
asks Nick to pass the phone to Carver to tell&nbsp;
him that he'll have to let Kira and Nick live&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:23.040
if he wants the case. Victor and Carver go to&nbsp;
the location of the suitcase, taking Nick and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:27.120
Kira along with them. When they arrive, Victor&nbsp;
knocks out Nick and puts him inside the trunk.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:30.880
After taking the suitcase from the locker,&nbsp;
the Pop family arrives with their henchmen.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:33.760
With numerous guns pointed at them,&nbsp;
Victor hurls sacks of colored powder&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:36.400
against the henchmen and blocks their&nbsp;
bullets to allow Carver to escape.

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:41.120
As the men keep firing at them, Victor throws&nbsp;
two thugs off the building. One of the men hits&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:45.360
Carver's car, damaging the trunk and allowing Nick&nbsp;
to get out. Nick makes his way up to the lockers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:50.560
armed with two guns. A group of men catches up to&nbsp;
Kira, but she uses her ability to manipulate them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:54.720
When Nick calls out to Kira, the group protects&nbsp;
her and points their gun at Nick. Victor hurls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:59.120
Nick down the stairs and sends him flying across&nbsp;
the room. As they engage in hand-to-hand combat,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:02.800
Victor blocks the bullets flying in their&nbsp;
direction. They exchange punches until Nick&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:07.680
knocks him down. A bleeder arrives and screams at&nbsp;
them, so Victor uses a sharp bamboo stick to stab&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:12.800
him in the neck. Pop Father, enraged by the death&nbsp;
of his son, kills Victor with his sonic scream.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:16.400
As Nick's ears start to bleed, he sends the&nbsp;
scaffolding crashing down on Pop Father.

00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:20.800
Carver notices Kira manipulating a group of&nbsp;
men, so he tells her that he's impressed by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:24.320
her abilities under the booster drug. He&nbsp;
tells her to march the men off the roof so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:29.120
they could finally leave. Nick, however, stops&nbsp;
Kira telling her that Carver is pushing her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:32.640
Nick tries to attack Carver, but he blocks&nbsp;
the attack and manipulates him into jumping&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:36.560
off the building. However, Nick turns&nbsp;
around and takes the syringe from Carver.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:40.000
When he sticks the needle into his arm,&nbsp;
Carver warns him that it will kill him.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.320
Nick injects himself with the substance and starts&nbsp;
writhing in pain until he becomes unconscious.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:47.920
After Carver and Kira leave, Cassie&nbsp;
arrives at the site and wakes him up.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:51.360
After taking the real suitcase from a bin,&nbsp;
she tells Nick that Division will do whatever&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:54.960
it takes to keep the drug from getting into&nbsp;
the wrong hands. Cassie says she still can't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:58.560
decide whether she'd trade the syringe for&nbsp;
her mother. When Nick asks what was in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:02.800
syringe that he injected into his veins, Cassie&nbsp;
discloses that it's "Nine Dragon Soy Sauce."

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:07.200
On a plane ride back to Division headquarters,&nbsp;
Kira sees the envelope that Nick prepared for her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:11.120
When she looks at the envelope's content, she&nbsp;
sees a photo of herself with Nick at Coney Island,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:16.000
with a note telling Kira to kill Carver. As Carver&nbsp;
sleeps, Kira stares at him, instructing him to put&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.240
the gun in his mouth and pull the trigger. Soon&nbsp;
after Carver opens his eyes, he shoots himself.
