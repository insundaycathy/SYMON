00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.170
Abraham Lincoln is the hero of the United
States and is consistently ranked as one of

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.640
the greatest presidents in American history.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:11.010
However, in the following movie, we'll see
him on a very special mission.

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.679
This is Movie Shortens.

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:15.150
Be aware, there are spoilers!

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.950
In 1818, little Will is being beaten by a
slaver at a plantation in Indiana.

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:25.700
Abraham Lincoln rushes to save his friend
but his father, Thomas, tries to stop him.

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.640
Abraham steps back and takes an ax, attempting
to kill the man.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.790
Unfortunately, the two boys then get more
brutal hits.

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.570
Thomas and his wife, Nancy, storm out to save
their son.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.650
He knocks the slaver off the river.

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:43.219
The owner, Jack Barts, appears and accuses
the Lincolns for attacking his people.

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:46.820
Due to Abraham’s action, they are all fired.

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.829
At night, Abraham sees a shadow entering his
house and gets closer to Nancy’s bed.

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:53.790
It is revealed to be the owner Jack.

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.899
The following day, Nancy becomes very ill,
even the doctor couldn’t explain her condition.

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:03.219
Abraham lies next to Nancy and reads her a
poem he made by himself.

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:05.270
Just then, Nancy dies.

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:09.590
At Nancy’s funeral, Thomas cries and tells
Abraham never to think about taking revenge

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.230
for his mother.

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:15.840
Abraham is bound by the promise to his father
until Thomas dies nine years later.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.220
He has to make Jack pay the price.

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:23.000
One night, after having some drinks in the
bar, a man approaches and talks to him but

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.210
Abraham only thinks about his revenge.

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.930
Later, Abraham comes to the plantation and
points the gun at Jack.

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.120
For some reason, his gun fails to trigger
at first.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.200
When Abraham runs away from Jack, he manages
to fix the gun and eventually shoots Jack

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.300
in the eye.

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.460
He then throws the gun to the river.

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.710
A second later, Jack suddenly appears with
the face of a vampire and attacks Abraham.

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.840
The strange man from the bar appears from
behind Jack and rescues Abraham.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.040
The following day, Abraham wakes up in a house.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.480
Later, he gets to see Henry Sturgess, who
saved his life last night.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:01.260
Henry explains that vampires exist around
the countries and to hunt them down, a person

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.950
needs to be well trained and commit to a life
completely alone.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.730
Abraham then pleads to be a vampire hunter.

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:10.709
Henry accepts him and the two start the training.

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.170
Abraham chooses his very first weapon is the
ax.

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.810
Henry tells Abraham that real power doesn’t
come from hatred, it’s from the truth.

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.069
Next, Henry trains the young man to fight
in the dark because the vampires can be invisible.

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:26.890
The two spend years for the hunting skills.

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.870
Henry also reveals that the vampires never
wear anything silver.

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.340
Silver is their weakness.

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.170
Henry gives Abraham a silver pocket watch.

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:40.349
Henry wants Abraham to kill the vampire’s
leaders: Adam and his sister Vadoma.

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:45.440
Other vampires including Jack Barts, his enemy,
are actually descended from them.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.640
Vampires have been in the New World for centuries.

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.610
They slaughter native tribes and early settlers.

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.200
But when the Europeans arrive with their slaves,
they see the opportunities to build an empire

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.200
of the undead.

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:02.220
The hunters, like Henry and Abraham, ensure
that this is a nation of men, and not monsters.

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.239
In 1837, Abraham comes to Springfield to study
law.

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:10.739
He befriends a shop owner named Joshua and
works at his shop to pay for the rent.

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:12.749
He also meets with Mary Todd.

00:03:12.749 --> 00:03:17.459
Though Henry used to warn a hunter not to
develop any relationship during his life,

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.989
Abraham soons has some feelings over Mary.

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:24.670
During the time living in Springfield, Abraham
has to hunt vampires, following Henry’s

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:25.670
letters.

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.829
One night, Abraham accidentally falls into
the trap of a vampire.

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:34.260
When the vampire almost cuts his neck for
blood supply, Abrahm manages to kill the monster

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.209
with a knife hidden before.

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:40.830
In the daytime, Abraham usually covers the
wounds when he is at work with Joshua.

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.810
One night, Joshua brings Abraham to a town
ball, which is also a good chance to meet

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.060
Mary again.

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.980
Seeing Abraham sitting alone in the party,
Mary teaches him to dance.

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.920
Their attachment irritates Mary’s fiance,
a Springfield senator.

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.239
Abraham spends night time hunting for vampires.

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:59.650
There are more and more appearing in town.

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.749
This makes him exhausted during the daytime
when he has a day out with Mary.

00:04:03.749 --> 00:04:08.420
Abraham reveals his identity to Mary, which
makes her even fall for him more.

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:12.769
However, Abraham decides to stay away from
Mary as it is the best for her safety.

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:18.329
Meanwhile, the fact that a mysterious hunter
has killed six vampires alerts Adam and Vadoma.

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:22.169
One night, Abraham reunites with Will, his
childhood friend.

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:27.590
He finds all the way to see Abraham, a law
student, to help him prove his true identity.

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.120
Will is born free and not a runaway.

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.190
On the way, the two are attacked by the bounty
hunters.

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.920
Abraham fights back with his remarkable strength.

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:40.639
However, the two end up in jail, and Mary
has to help them out.

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:45.139
During this time, Abraham proves himself to
be a very potential politician.

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:48.410
His contributions to the community impress
the town senators.

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:53.410
Henry appears in town and lets Abraham know
that Jacks has noticed Mary for a long time.

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:55.780
It is now time for Henry to kill Jack.

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:00.350
In a furious horse chase, there is a very
competitive fight between Abraham and Jack.

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:02.190
Abraham finally defeats Jack.

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:05.720
Before dying, Jack reveals that Henry is actually
a vampire.

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.930
Later, Abraham finds Henry to know about the
truth.

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:13.430
Henry confesses that years ago, he was attacked
by Adam and became a vampire.

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:17.949
As Henry’s soul is impure, he can’t kill
Adam or any other vampires.

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:19.710
Only the living can kill the dead.

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:23.980
He thinks of a plan to train for vampire hunters
like Abraham, hoping to destroy the entire

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:26.030
vampires and eventually Adam.

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:28.849
Abraham is disappointed and leaves Henry after
that.

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:30.840
He quits being a vampire hunter.

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:34.330
Coming back to the shop, Abraham proposes
marriage to Mary.

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.590
The couple then have a fabulous wedding.

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:40.539
Henry shows up at the wedding and warns Abraham
that giving up on the hunter mission does

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:42.000
more harm to Mary.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.020
Abraham just ignores Henry.

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:48.360
Meanwhile, Adam and Vadoma find out about
Abraham's identity by the silver watch in

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:49.560
Jack's hand.

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.870
They kidnap Will and use him to lure Abraham
to a party.

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:57.009
Abraham tells Joshua the truth and they come
to the plantation to save Will.

00:05:57.009 --> 00:06:00.560
At the party, Abraham sees the slaves become
vampire food.

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:04.750
Abraham storms in and destroys some of the
vampires with his silver ax.

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:07.930
Vadoma appears and chains Abraham with a chair.

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:12.240
Adam wants to recruit Abraham, making him
a right-hand man for the plan to make the

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:13.699
US a country of the undead.

00:06:13.699 --> 00:06:18.620
When Adam is about to take blood from Will,
Joshua appears with a horse ride and furiously

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:20.210
rescues the friends.

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:23.780
The slaves help the friends to run away from
Adam and Vadoma.

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:28.900
From that moment, Abraham develops his political
career, aiming to eliminate slavery.

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:32.870
Henry argues that the slave trade helps the
vampire under control all these years.

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:36.840
If Abraham interferes with them, the vampire
will rage on.

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:40.729
Abraham decides to separate from Henry and
insists on his path.

00:06:40.729 --> 00:06:45.020
He’ll not fight with the ax anymore, but
with words and ideals.

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:49.689
Later, Abraham Lincoln becomes the President
of the United States.

00:06:49.689 --> 00:06:52.449
Will and Joshua become his very close assistants.

00:06:52.449 --> 00:06:56.370
He moves to the White House with Mary when
the US falls into a civil war.

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:58.580
They have a son named William.

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:01.659
Vadoma disguises to a servant and poisons
William.

00:07:01.659 --> 00:07:05.110
The boy becomes very sick for days and dies
shortly after that.

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:07.280
Mary blames Abraham for everything.

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:11.360
Henry shows up and tells Abraham that the
boy’s death is just a beginning.

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.960
There are more and more casualties during
the war.

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:16.460
The vampires are becoming more powerful than
ever.

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:20.270
Abraham suddenly thinks of a solution when
he holds a silver fork.

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:24.650
He orders all the silverware in the area and
turns it into silver weapons.

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:28.699
Joshua thinks Abraham is out of mind and he
is killing the country.

00:07:28.699 --> 00:07:32.919
He then takes the vampire's side and reveals
Abraham’s silver plan to Vadoma.

00:07:32.919 --> 00:07:36.169
Abraham plans to transport all the silver
on a train.

00:07:36.169 --> 00:07:40.479
Meanwhile, Mary and a lot of slaves are on
their way to leave Washington.

00:07:40.479 --> 00:07:45.880
On the train, Henry shows up and lets Abraham
know that Joshua is a betrayal, but Abraham

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:47.220
doesn’t buy it.

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:50.749
Later, Will and Abraham fight with the vampires
on the running train.

00:07:50.749 --> 00:07:54.340
Abraham takes his silver ax back and kills
countless monsters.

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:56.270
Henry also joins Abraham and Will.

00:07:56.270 --> 00:08:01.150
In the car train, Adam learns that the silver
cargos are actually all rocks.

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:04.639
It turns out Joshua meant to trap Adam at
the beginning.

00:08:04.639 --> 00:08:07.910
This whole rock plan was set up by Abraham
before.

00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:10.060
Joshua then gets killed by Adam.

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:14.789
As the train is about to crash into a fire,
which was set by Vadoma before, Abraham uses

00:08:14.789 --> 00:08:16.340
his watch to stab Adam.

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:19.070
The three finally escape and survive.

00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:22.840
The silver weapons are actually transported
by Mary and the slaves.

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:27.310
Armed with their silver weapons, the soldiers
destroy the vampires and eventually win the

00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:28.310
war.

00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:32.750
During the battle, Mary avenges her son by
shooting Vadoma in the head.

00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:36.450
Abraham finally makes the US reborn with liberty
and only the living.

00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:39.990
The remaining vampires have to escape to other
parts around the world.

00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:44.690
Henry convinces Abraham to become a vampire
so he can be immortal and continue his mission

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:46.560
of destroying the vampires.

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:48.740
However, Abraham declines his idea.

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:52.790
Later, ​​Abraham Lincoln is murdered by
John Wilkes Booth.

00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:58.540
In modern time, Henry approaches a young man
and talks to him as the way he first met Abraham

00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:00.029
long ago.
