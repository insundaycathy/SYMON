pieces of wood fly towards him impaling it to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.960

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:48.240
of a greedy man who gets everything in the world&nbsp;

following morning jaguar wakes from the noise of a&nbsp;
barking dog he feels something is wrong he's also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.240
scared because of what happened with other tribe&nbsp;
he encountered the previous day then we are shown&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.520
a group of blood thirsty raiders from the central&nbsp;
city of maya standing outside led by a man called&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:15.120
zero wolf the group is hidden behind the trees&nbsp;
at their leader's signal the group comes out of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.480
the trees with flame torches when jaguar spots&nbsp;
the flames he realizes that something is wrong&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.840
he wakes up his family then brings them outside&nbsp;
one of the raiders sees them but jaguar kills&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:31.520
him jaguar takes his family to a pit for safety&nbsp;
he starts sending his son and pregnant wife into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:37.520
the pit using a rope while doing this one of the&nbsp;
raiders spots him he starts running towards jaguar&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.680
he quickly drops his kid and wife in the&nbsp;
pit he makes the raider falls with his foot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:47.360
but before he could fall into the pit jaguar holds&nbsp;
his foot the man sees that his wife and child are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.960
in the pit but before he could tell anyone jaguar&nbsp;
kills him he tells his wife and kid that he has to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:58.640
go to help his people even though his wife tells&nbsp;
him not to go he promises her that he will return&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.000
after saying this he leaves jaguar sees that&nbsp;
most of the men have been captured many are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.680
dead and the village is in chaos there is a very&nbsp;
dangerous raider named middle eye about to kill&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:16.000
jaguar's father jaguar attacks and nearly kill him&nbsp;
before he is captured by zero wolf although middle&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.640
eye wants to kill jaguar here but zero wolf tells&nbsp;
him not to he says he needs him jaguar's father is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:28.480
also a captive here he apologizes to his father&nbsp;
middle eye listens and he comes to know that he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:34.000
is jaguar's father so he kills him in front of&nbsp;
jaguar to repay the humiliation suffered from him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.840
after he beats jaguar to unconsciousness when he&nbsp;
wakes up he sees that all his tribe has been taken&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.640
hostage the surviving adult are tied up and they&nbsp;
are forced to match through the jungle leaving&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:50.720
the children behind in pain and fear jaguar's&nbsp;
wife and some remains in the pit the captives&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.920
meet the other tribe who had given them fish the&nbsp;
previous day these raiders had captured them too&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.040
now all of them proceed for a long journey where&nbsp;
they have to cross rivers in high mountains&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.640
after this horrific journey they reach&nbsp;
the boundary of the raiders tribe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:10.480
they see a dead body the body makes it clear these&nbsp;
people are suffering from some sort of disease&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:16.080
which spreads from contact here is an infected&nbsp;
little girl they try to push her away but seems&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:21.440
to be possessed she foretells the end of maya&nbsp;
tribe she says the day will get dark a man&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:26.800
will take all of them away from their tribe which&nbsp;
will be the end of their empire they move forward&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.280
here is the central city of maya it's shown the&nbsp;
city is suffering from drought and plague for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:36.000
a very long time with unknown causes and they&nbsp;
sort to their gods to restore back their city&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.720
by executing captives to fill the blood&nbsp;
thirst of their gods the captured women&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:45.600
are auctioned and sold but the men are painted&nbsp;
blue and taken ahead to a very crowded pyramid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:51.040
actually here the priest sacrifices captives&nbsp;
by cutting into the hearts to please their gods&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:56.800
now jaguar is taken for the sacrifice but&nbsp;
before they could kill jaguar solar eclipse&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:02.480
occurs it becomes dark everywhere the priest stops&nbsp;
believing the gods are satisfied with the blood&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:07.760
thanks to that the captives are spared their&nbsp;
life temporarily before taken to another place&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:12.560
it's a long ground there is a cornfield on the&nbsp;
other side which leads to the captives village&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:18.320
all of them are told to run to their forests&nbsp;
here the son of the leader is also present&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:23.040
his son goes to the end of the ground near the&nbsp;
cornfield as a finisher they are made to run in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:27.520
twos the mayan raiders throw different weapons&nbsp;
at them from behind to kill them as they run&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.600
the first two died now it's&nbsp;
jaguar and his partner's turn&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:38.640
jaguar's partner is shot dead by nero jaguar also&nbsp;
gets impaled by an arrow but he is not dead yet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:43.440
zero wolf's son comes here to finish&nbsp;
jaguar but before he could do so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:48.240
an injured man draws him back a bit then takes&nbsp;
out a knife and proceeds to finish jaguar&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:53.760
jaguar had broken the tip of the arrow which&nbsp;
impaled him he slashes his throat with that arrow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:59.920
then runs into the cornfield actually those mayan&nbsp;
raiders were using the captives just for practice&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:06.240
jaguar runs into a swamp pit full of dead bodies&nbsp;
he's terrified by this he soon enters into the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:12.160
jungle and he suffers the arrow wound jaguar&nbsp;
climbs a tree on the other hand the leader's son&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:19.040
is dead this makes zero wolf furious he now wants&nbsp;
to end jaguar anyhow they all start searching for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:24.960
him they cross the tree on which jaguar is sitting&nbsp;
but couldn't see him after going a bit further one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:30.320
of the raiders sees blood on the back of another&nbsp;
raider which isn't his he realizes it is jaguar's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:35.840
blood who is above a tree they all come back to&nbsp;
find him on the tree jaguar spots the cub of a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:41.120
panther the cub's mother comes there jaguar starts&nbsp;
running in the direction of the mayans raider&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:47.360
they are also coming towards him now jaguar is&nbsp;
running at full speed the panther is chasing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:53.760
him before it could attack jaguar a raider who is&nbsp;
chasing after him comes in between them the animal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:59.120
kills him and jaguar escapes the fellow raiders&nbsp;
considered this as a bad omen regarding to what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:04.320
the possessed little girl foretold but still zero&nbsp;
wolf ordered the men to continue chasing after&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:10.240
jaguar after a long chase throughout the night a&nbsp;
raider died due to a snake attack the next morning&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:15.600
they still continue the chase after jaguar where&nbsp;
he comes across a dead end there is a waterfall&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:21.440
in front jumping from it might mean death but his&nbsp;
death is behind him too he jumps his fate complies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:27.360
and he reaches the shore when he looks upwards&nbsp;
he sees that the raiders are watching him jaguar&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:32.240
challenges them because he has entered the forest&nbsp;
where he used to hunt zero wolf kills a raider&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:38.240
that proposed to detour the waterfall the raiders&nbsp;
jump one by one from above causes a raider's death&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:44.400
but the rest come to the shore jaguar runs&nbsp;
but falls in a swamp he somehow escapes his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:50.880
whole body is covered in mud suddenly his whole&nbsp;
mind becomes numb he decided not fear anymore&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:56.000
and instead fight back when the raiders come there&nbsp;
he uses different techniques to kill everyone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:01.840
firstly you fight them with a beehive then he&nbsp;
kills one with an improvised frog's poison arrow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:07.760
at that moment he encounters middle eye who killed&nbsp;
his father jaguar sees a weapon lying there both&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:13.920
of them run towards each other when jaguar reaches&nbsp;
he drags onto his knees to reach the weapon middle&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:19.920
eye misses his strike but jaguar doesn't miss he&nbsp;
kills middle eye instantly then it starts raining&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:25.840
jaguar's wife and son are in the pit the pit&nbsp;
starts filling his wife also goes into labor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:31.680
jaguar runs to the pit his wife and son tell&nbsp;
him to take them out the remaining three raiders&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:37.120
are still coming behind him which gives him no&nbsp;
opportunity to rescue his family so being chased&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:43.680
by zero wolf jaguar stops while running actually&nbsp;
he saw something zero wolf reaches there and he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:48.400
shoots him with an arrow it hits him slightly&nbsp;
above his heart he stands and confront him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:53.360
zero wolf throws out his bow and arrow&nbsp;
takes out his knife with rage he runs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:58.000
towards jaguar to finish him suddenly he&nbsp;
triggers a trap which killed him instantly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:02.640
jaguar had to run from here because the&nbsp;
remaining two raiders are coming after him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:06.320
on the other hand it is shown that the&nbsp;
pit is filling gradually and his wife&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:11.920
gives birth to a baby exhausted jaguar runs to&nbsp;
the ocean shores where he catches the sight of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:17.280
some enormous ships the two raiders reaches&nbsp;
there but however stop their attack they also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:21.920
start staring at the ships throwing anchors on&nbsp;
the shore these people in the ships are coming&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:27.200
towards this land in small boats jaguar gets the&nbsp;
chance to runs to his family and saves them all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:33.120
in the end we are shown that jaguar is in the&nbsp;
forest with his family his wife is watching huge&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:38.640
ships from there she asks jaguar if they should&nbsp;
go there jaguar says that they should go in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:44.240
forest so that they can do a new start actually&nbsp;
the people in these ships are europeans they have&nbsp;&nbsp;
