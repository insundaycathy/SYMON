00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.480
Story Recapped here. Today I'm going&nbsp;
to explain a psychological horror film&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.560
called It Comes At Night. Spoilers&nbsp;
ahead! Watch out and take care.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:17.120
A highly contagious disease has wiped out most of&nbsp;
humanity. Sarah, Paul, and their son Travis hide&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:22.560
in a cottage in the woods to escape the plague.&nbsp;
When Sarah's father, Bud, starts showing symptoms&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.200
of the disease, Sarah says goodbye to him before&nbsp;
letting her husband and son take him to the woods.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:33.200
There, Paul sets his father-in-law down. After&nbsp;
saying their goodbyes, Paul covers Bud's face with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.840
a pillow and shoots him on the head. Paul pushes&nbsp;
the body on a shallow grave before burning it.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.840
That evening, Travis secretly&nbsp;
listens to his parent's conversation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.080
Sarah laments that Travis shouldn't have been&nbsp;
there to witness his grandfather's death,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.160
but Paul insists that he needed Travis's&nbsp;
help. Paul is optimistic that he can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.160
protect his family from this disease.&nbsp;
But the grieving Sarah is losing hope.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.640
Not wanting to hear more, Travis&nbsp;
heads to his bedroom to sleep. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.960
reminisces as he looks at&nbsp;
his grandfather's picture.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.120
Travis walks down the hallway, seeing&nbsp;
their family photos on the wall.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:11.040
He reaches a red door and opens it. Inside,&nbsp;
plastic sheets cover the windows and door.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.400
He sees Bud sitting on a bed, huddled&nbsp;
over and struggling to breathe.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.120
When he gets closer, Bud straightens up&nbsp;
and screams, blood pouring from his mouth.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.840
Sarah shakes her son awake, panicked.&nbsp;
There's an intruder in the house.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:30.320
Downstairs, Paul keeps their dog, Stanley, from&nbsp;
rushing to the intruder. Sarah and Travis join&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.040
them, wearing gas masks and gloves. Paul aims&nbsp;
his gun forward, shining a light on their path.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.440
They reach the same hallway in Travis's&nbsp;
dream. Someone is beyond the red door,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.320
alarming the family. Paul crouches, aiming&nbsp;
at the door, with Sarah as his backup.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.680
The door breaks open, and Paul pulls the&nbsp;
trigger. The man on the other side staggers back.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:56.800
Paul rushes in, cornering the intruder, Will,&nbsp;
and demanding him to put down his gun. Will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.560
surrenders his firearm, and Paul inspects&nbsp;
Will's eyes to make sure he's not sick.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.040
After confirming that Will is alone, Paul&nbsp;
knocks him out with the back of his gun.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.760
Paul inspects the man's belongings and sees&nbsp;
an open window. He then checks the perimeter,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:13.040
ensuring that no one else is around&nbsp;
while Sarah and Travis watch Will.

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.760
That morning, they take the unconscious&nbsp;
Will into the woods to quarantine him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.480
They tie him to a tree and&nbsp;
put duct tape over his mouth.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.640
Then, the family fortifies their home&nbsp;
to prevent anyone else from coming in.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.920
Will finally wakes up, finding a bag over&nbsp;
his head. He tries to yell and struggle free,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.880
but to no avail. Everyone at home hears his&nbsp;
muffled cries. Sarah is disturbed by what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.560
they had to do. Travis hugs Stanley&nbsp;
to help him sleep through the night.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.200
At night, Travis walks outside,&nbsp;
following Will's muffled cries.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.640
Instead, he sees Will with blackened eyes staring&nbsp;
down at him. He wakes up, disturbed by the image.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.160
On the following day, Travis watches from a hole&nbsp;
in the wall as his father interrogates Will.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.200
Paul checks for any signs of&nbsp;
infection before removing his mask.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.800
He offers the other a jug of&nbsp;
water in return for some honesty.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.880
Finally, he removes the duct&nbsp;
tape, allowing the man to speak.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.240
Will confesses that he thought the house was&nbsp;
abandoned, so he went in and looked for supplies.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:15.120
He reveals that he has a family who's waiting for&nbsp;
him to get more food and water. Paul presses for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.080
more information, unconvinced. Will says that he&nbsp;
and his family stayed with his brother to avoid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.920
the disease. But when they ran out of clean&nbsp;
water, Will took his family into the woods.

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.480
Will negotiates a trade, telling Paul that&nbsp;
he has enough food to trade for clean water.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.240
Will's family managed to keep healthy goats&nbsp;
and chickens to supply them with food.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.520
Knowing that their supply will&nbsp;
run out, Paul considers it.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:41.120
The family discusses the situation inside their&nbsp;
home. Sarah figured that Will must have followed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.280
the smoke from when they burned her father's body,&nbsp;
doubting that he believed the house was abandoned.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.080
Despite their doubts, however, Sarah suggests&nbsp;
bringing Will's family back into their home.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.720
Paul argues that it's too risky. But&nbsp;
Will already knows their location,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.480
so Sarah argues that it's wiser to include&nbsp;
them in their home to help protect it.

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.120
Paul decides that he'll wait with Will's family&nbsp;
for three days to ensure that they're not sick&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.640
before bringing them in. Paul takes&nbsp;
Will with him to collect his family.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.960
Will sits at the back of the truck,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:13.040
giving Paul directions. There's unease&nbsp;
between them, but they press on.

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:18.320
The sound of gunfire causes Paul to swerve off the&nbsp;
road. Paul climbs out of the car and hides under&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:23.120
the vehicle with his gun in hand. A stranger&nbsp;
emerges out of the woods, and Paul shoots him.

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:29.280
He gets out, seeing Will beat another man. Paul&nbsp;
finishes the man with his gun, but Will disagrees&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:34.400
with his actions. Paul suspects that Will knew&nbsp;
the men. He denies it, reasoning that they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.360
could've gained information from the men. Paul&nbsp;
considers this, realizing that Will may be right.

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.720
Paul helps Will clean up then checks if the men&nbsp;
were sick. Once confirming that they're not,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.800
they hide the bodies and fix the truck. Paul&nbsp;
looks back at the men before they leave.

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:55.520
Days later, Paul finally returns with Will and his&nbsp;
family. He introduces Will's wife, Kim, and their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:00.720
son, Andrew. The family helps the newcomers settle&nbsp;
in, teaching them the rules they've been using to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.280
stay safe, such as keeping the front and back door&nbsp;
locked at all times and never going out alone.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.000
In the evening, Travis goes to the&nbsp;
attic to eavesdrop on the newcomers.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.040
Kim and Will joke around while in&nbsp;
bed with their son playing nearby.

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:17.760
The two families grow closer together&nbsp;
as the days go by. Will teaches Travis&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.200
how to chop firewood while Sarah and Kim&nbsp;
help each other to maintain their home.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:25.120
They find a sense of a normal life&nbsp;
amidst the troubles of the outside world.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.120
One evening, Travis dreams about hearing Kim and&nbsp;
Will make love. He wakes up to find Kim sitting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:36.240
by his bed. She kisses him, and black liquid&nbsp;
spills from her mouth, pouring on his lips.

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:41.920
Travis huddles over the sink as if spitting the&nbsp;
liquid out. Looking at the mirror, he ponders over&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:46.640
the dreams he's been having. Travis climbs down&nbsp;
the stairs and sees Kim by herself in the kitchen.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:51.440
Both he and Kim couldn't sleep, so they&nbsp;
decided to talk. The two share stories,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:56.560
but when Kim starts talking about Will, Travis&nbsp;
feels awkward and decides to go back to bed.

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:01.680
In the morning, the three men gather firewood&nbsp;
when Paul catches his son, Travis, watching Kim&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:06.320
collect water. Paul reminds him that they still&nbsp;
can't trust anyone else but their own family.

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:12.080
Stanley starts barking at something in the woods.&nbsp;
Paul tells his son to go back inside and let him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:17.360
handle it, but Stanley bites Paul, accidentally&nbsp;
releasing him. Travis chases after his dog,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:21.120
who rushes into the woods. Despite&nbsp;
Stanley's consistent barking,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:25.440
Travis doesn't see him. The barks turn&nbsp;
into whines before suddenly stopping.

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:28.400
Will finds Travis, who points&nbsp;
to where he last heard the dog.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:33.920
Paul reaches them, furious that his son went&nbsp;
into the woods by himself. He insists the two&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:38.080
go back to the house, arguing that Stanley&nbsp;
knows the woods and can get home by himself.

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:41.440
That evening, seeing that&nbsp;
his son is still worried,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:43.920
Paul assures that Stanley&nbsp;
will find his way back home.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:48.560
When Travis isn't convinced, Paul promises&nbsp;
to start looking for the dog in the morning.

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:52.080
Paul invites Will for a drink in Bud's old room.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:56.800
The two talk about life before the sickness.&nbsp;
When Will mentions that he was an only child,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:01.280
Paul recalls Will's story about staying in&nbsp;
his brother's house before leaving the city.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:05.440
Will corrects himself, saying that it was his&nbsp;
brother-in-law's house that they stayed in before.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.800
Tension fills the air. Paul is not entirely&nbsp;
convinced but decides to drop it and leave.

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:15.040
Later that night, Travis gets out&nbsp;
of bed, unable to sleep again.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:19.520
He follows a moaning in the dark and finds&nbsp;
Andrew asleep on the floor of Bud's room.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:23.520
Travis wakes him up and takes him back&nbsp;
to their bedroom, where Andrew climbs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:28.240
back to bed with his parents. Travis lingers to&nbsp;
watch the family together before heading back.

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:33.200
Another sound catches his attention.&nbsp;
He climbs down the stairs cautiously.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:38.240
He reaches the hallway and sees the red&nbsp;
door open. A loud crash makes Travis jump.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:42.880
He rushes to his dad, waking him up.&nbsp;
With gas masks on and gun in hand,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:46.160
Paul and Will investigate and find&nbsp;
Stanley wounded and moaning in pain.

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:50.080
The two come back inside, delivering&nbsp;
the news to their families.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:54.000
Travis insists on seeing his&nbsp;
dog, but Paul argues with him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.840
Sarah takes Travis to the living room while&nbsp;
Paul and Will put the dog out of its misery.

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:03.520
Later that evening, the family have a discussion.&nbsp;
Travis tells the others that the door was already&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:08.160
open before he went downstairs. He suggests&nbsp;
that it may have been Andrew who opened it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:12.400
recounting how he found the boy sleeping in Bud's&nbsp;
bedroom before taking him back to his parents.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:16.480
Kim asks her son about what happened,&nbsp;
but Andrew doesn't remember anything.

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:22.320
Kim and Will try to poke holes in Travis' story&nbsp;
and this causes tension between the two families.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:26.320
Paul suggests that they should stay in each&nbsp;
others' bedrooms for a few days, in case&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:31.280
someone is infected. The others agree, taking&nbsp;
in enough water and rations into their rooms.

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:35.520
In their bedroom, Travis confesses&nbsp;
that he held Andrew's hands when he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:39.040
brought him back to his parents&nbsp;
that night. Travis is broken up,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:43.040
both about Stanley and the possibility of&nbsp;
getting sick from having contact with Andrew.

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:48.480
Travis dreams about going to the red door again&nbsp;
and leaving the house. He follows barking into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:53.840
the woods. Picking up a gun from the ground,&nbsp;
he searches for Stanley. The barks grow louder,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:59.280
turning into growls. His eyes widen in fear as he&nbsp;
watches Stanley fight off an unseen wild animal.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.680
Travis wakes up, vomiting black&nbsp;
liquid. He stares at the mess&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:06.480
in his arms before lifting his&nbsp;
eyes to the figure before him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:10.240
Bud breathes heavily in front of him,&nbsp;
black liquid dripping from his mouth.

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:14.720
Travis wakes again, catching a&nbsp;
glimpse of sores on his arms.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:19.600
He scrubs it away before realizing that it&nbsp;
was just his imagination. His arms are normal,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:23.680
and his hands are clean. He takes a breath&nbsp;
of relief until he hears Andrew's cries from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:28.320
outside. Travis leaves their room and crawls&nbsp;
into the attic to eavesdrop on the other family.

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:33.680
Andrew continues to cry. Kim and Will are&nbsp;
distraught, talking about leaving the house.

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:38.880
Travis goes back to their room and tells his&nbsp;
parents what he heard, suggesting that Andrew&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:43.200
might be sick. Paul and Sarah put their&nbsp;
protective gear on, telling Travis that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:48.160
if Kim and Will leave, they may take their food&nbsp;
and water. Travis argues that they can share,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:51.920
but Paul reminds him that people can get&nbsp;
desperate, while Sarah tells him that they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:56.800
still don't know the other family, so they can't&nbsp;
risk it. Travis tells them that if Andrew is sick,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:00.800
then he might be too. Sarah tries to&nbsp;
convince her son that it isn't the case.

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:04.640
Armed, Sarah and Paul go to the&nbsp;
other bedroom to check on them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:08.800
Paul convinces Will to let him in,&nbsp;
reminding him that it's their house.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:12.960
Will finally opens the door, asking&nbsp;
where Sarah and Travis are. Paul lies,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:18.000
saying they're both in the room. Hearing this,&nbsp;
Will aims a gun at Paul's head and takes his gun.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.200
Held at gunpoint, Paul goes&nbsp;
into a corner of the room.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:25.840
Will demands he removes his mask, then tells&nbsp;
Andrew to keep his eyes closed. Will announces&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:29.600
that they'll take their share of food and water,&nbsp;
promising that they will never see them again.

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:33.440
With Paul as his captive, Will&nbsp;
gets his family out of the room.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:36.960
As they climb down the stairs, Sarah&nbsp;
comes out, aiming her gun at Will.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:41.920
Will repeats his plan to Sarah, then suggests&nbsp;
for both of them to lower their weapons.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:46.960
But when they do, Paul steals the gun from Will&nbsp;
and knocks him down. Kim and Andrew reach the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:52.080
door, but Sarah corners them. Kim puts Andrew&nbsp;
behind her, begging for Sarah to let them go.

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:55.120
All the while, Travis hears&nbsp;
the commotion from the bedroom,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:57.040
broken and torn at what their home has become.

00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:01.680
Tension continues to rise downstairs,&nbsp;
with Paul knocking Will out after the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:06.240
latter insults him. Will wakes up in&nbsp;
a wheelbarrow. Kim carries Andrew,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:10.240
still held at gunpoint by Sarah. When he&nbsp;
sees Will wake up, Paul takes him off the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:14.640
wheelbarrow and demands him to get up. Will slams&nbsp;
the gun off of Paul's hand and tackles him down.

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:19.120
Travis finally gets out of the bedroom,&nbsp;
hearing a gunshot from outside.

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:23.280
Will beats Paul until Sarah shoots him&nbsp;
on the back. Kim flees into the woods&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:27.760
with Andrew. Getting up, Paul warns Kim to&nbsp;
stop. When she doesn't, Paul fires his gun,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:31.920
hitting Andrew instead. Kim's cries&nbsp;
stop everyone, including Travis,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:37.760
who just entered the scene. In grief and anger,&nbsp;
Kim dares Paul to shoot her too. Paul pushes down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:42.480
the guilt and fires his gun at Kim, ending her&nbsp;
agony. Will succumbs to his injuries as well.

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:48.640
Travis is frozen in shock, seeing the chaos.&nbsp;
His mother cries to him, but he's unresponsive.

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:54.560
Back in the house, Travis vomits on the sink.&nbsp;
He looks in the mirror, now sure that he's sick.

00:11:55.440 --> 00:12:00.880
One night, Travis wakes up in bed with his mother&nbsp;
sitting at his side. Sarah comforts her son,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:05.280
seeing sores on his face. She mournfully&nbsp;
tells him that it's okay for him to let go.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.760
Travis dreams of walking into the&nbsp;
red door again. At this moment,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:15.120
Travis passes on. His parents are broken, losing&nbsp;
their son despite everything that they've done.

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:18.000
Days later, Paul and Sarah,&nbsp;
both sick from the disease,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.920
sit at the dinner table in silence. They&nbsp;
share a mournful look, knowing what's to come.
