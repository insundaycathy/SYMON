00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:13.550
Once Upon A Time In Hollywood is shaking up
the movie industry with its star-studded cast

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:16.500
and alternate ending that changes the facts
to fiction.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.500
Throughout this, I’ll be breaking down everything
that you need to know about the end of the

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.090
movie and discussing how it alters the actual
events of the Manson Murders and death of

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:26.180
Sharon Tate.

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.950
There will be heavy spoilers here so if you
haven’t seen the film yet and don’t want

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:32.810
to know what happens then I highly suggest
that you turn off now.

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:38.410
There are some typical Tarantino-esque twists
here and the surprises are worth seeing unspoiled

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.910
so this is your last chance to enjoy the film
with fresh eyes.

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.870
With that out the way, I just wanna give a
huge thank you for clicking this video now

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.350
let’s get into my breakdown of Once Upon
A Time In Hollywood.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.992
Once Upon A Time In Hollywood Plot Recap
________________

00:00:50.992 --> 00:00:54.770
Once Upon A Time is set to the backdrop of
the infamous Manson Murders, particularly

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:56.250
the death of Sharon Tate.

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.510
However, the film is somewhat satirical and
similar to Inglorious Basterds, the film gives

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.110
the truth a rather more Hollywood ending.

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.350
The movie itself follows Rick Dalton and his
friend Cliff Booth played by Leonardo DiCaprio

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.330
and Brad Pitt respectively.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.530
Dalton was once at the top of his game, however,
all good things must come to an end and his

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.560
career seems like it’s going on a complete
downward spiral.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.570
The film chronicles his journey to what he
thinks is the bottom rung of the ladder and

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.189
along the way he and Booth bump into the likes
of many big real names in Hollywood including

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.220
Bruce Lee.

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:32.140
They also meet Catherine Share played by Lena
Dunham who just so happens to be the ringleader

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.690
of the Manson girls which plays into the end.

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:35.690
The Manson Crimes
________________

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.330
On the whole, though the tale is mostly fictional
and after Dalton ends up getting married,

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.740
he and Booth decide to part ways but they
want just one more night of drinking to celebrate

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.480
all they’ve been through together.

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:55.270
This just so happens to be on August the 8th,
which is my birthday by the way, and is, of

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.590
course, the infamous night that four followers
of Charles Manson decided to murder Sharon

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.079
Tate who just so happens to be a neighbour
of Dalton.

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:06.080
In real life, they then went on to kill Tate
and her house guests.

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.119
Manson did this to try and frame the Black
Panthers in order to start a race war that

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.290
would eventually lead to the apocalypse known
as ‘Helter Skelter.’

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.440
Though the murders did happen, Manson and
his followers were eventually jailed before

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.579
the situation could escalate any more and
he and his followers went down in history

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:25.280
as some of the worst serial killers of all
time.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.630
However, the film completely changes the events
from about this point onwards and paints out

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.130
history with rose-tinted glasses.

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:32.130

FULL SPOILER TALK REVIEW

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.130
Once Upon A Time In Hollywood Ending
________________

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.560
During the bender, Rick who is sick and tired
of all the hippies goes face to face with

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.340
the killers who have parked up outside the
houses and he warns orders them to leave,

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:41.340
which they do.

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.810
That doesn’t mean it’s over though and
the group of murderers come up with a new

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.470
plan on Manson’s orders to kill Rick instead.

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.519
To them, it doesn’t really matter who the
target is as long as their message is spread

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:52.090
so they head back to his house.

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.109
The killers return to the house but what we
get instead of some brutal murders is some

00:02:56.109 --> 00:03:01.341
over the top, highly graphic violence that
has its tongue placed firmly in its cheek.

00:03:01.341 --> 00:03:06.640
It’s all-out war with Rick his wife, Cliff
and the dog all getting into it with the acolytes.

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.450
Eventually, they manage to kill them and overcome
the threat and Tate who lives just next door

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.550
overhears the ruckus and goes out to find
out what happened.

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:19.310
Rick knows that she’s married to Roman Polanski
but till now he hasn’t really had the opportunity

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:24.400
to speak to her, however, this is the perfect
introduction to finally get talking to her

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.250
and to get his career back on track.

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.890
The film ends with the two talking like old
friends and we get a happy ending that basically

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.470
rewrites history and makes Rick the hero of
his own movie.

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:39.010
It’s an awesome ending that in true Tarantino
Fashion lets us look back on the past with

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.030
wishful thinking and makes us wonder what
we could have got had the events played out

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:44.030
differently.

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:45.030
Once Upon A Time In Hollywood Fact VS Fiction
________________

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.889
On the whole, the movie actually does stick
to the facts in terms of the main players

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:53.630
with all of the killers including Tex Watson,
Susan Atkins, Linda Kasabian and Katie all

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:55.389
having real-life counterparts.

00:03:55.389 --> 00:03:58.760
On the night that they were going to commit
the murders though there was no Rick Dalton

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.019
and thus the group was able to carry out their
brutal killings.

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:06.250
Though Polanski was a target at the time he
was actually away during the murders and the

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.979
group killed Tate who was 8 months pregnant
and all of her party guests.

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:14.160
The killings were very brutal and I definitely
recommend that you watch one of the many youtube

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.870
documentaries on the matter if this movie
has piqued your interest.

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:17.870
When exiting the house they wrote ‘pig’
on the front door in Tate’s blood and it

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:18.870
really was a horrifying crime.

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:19.870
Once Upon A Time In Hollywood Ending Explained
________________

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.200
But what does it all mean, well to me the
entire film is a quest for fame and how in

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.550
order to get it and hold onto it we have to
do terrible things.

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.909
Dalton, Booth and even the Mansons are all
focused solely on gaining recognition and

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:35.270
trying to keep a hold of it as tightly as
possible and to me this symbolises just how

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:38.560
Hollywood subverts the innocent in exchange
for status.

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.849
The movie business as a whole is all about
the flavor of the month and in the film, even

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:46.830
though Tate is currently popular, we get the
feeling that deep down she knows that she

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:47.980
won’t be forever.

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:53.160
Overall to me, the film is a comment on how
Hollywood romanticizes these aspects and paints

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:58.111
it all out as one big happy ending even though
we know as an audience that this isn’t the

00:04:58.111 --> 00:04:59.300
case.

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.729
Just as Tarantino changed history, Hollywood
does too and the piece should be viewed as

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:08.849
a parody of how the movie business as a whole
is unwilling to show it’s dark underside

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:17.479
even though we all know that it exists.

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:19.650
Your Thoughts
Obviously, I’d love to hear your thoughts

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:22.180
on this take and if you agree with me.
