00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.720
Welcome back for another 5 minute movie recap.

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:05.360
Today, I'm going to give&nbsp;
you an overview of the 2020&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:07.520
American horror thriller film called 'The Hunt'.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.120
There will be Spoilers ahead,&nbsp;
so please proceed with caution.

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.520
Athena Stone mentions an impending search&nbsp;
for deplorables at a mansion in a group text&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:20.640
('Manorgate'). She murders a guy who staggers out&nbsp;
of the cargo hold later aboard her private plane.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:26.400
Eleven prisoners awake in a jungle, gagged and&nbsp;
ready for the hunt. They discover a stockpile of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.880
weapons and keys to their gags in a clearing, but&nbsp;
five of them are murdered by an unknown adversary&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.600
while obtaining them. Three prisoners make their&nbsp;
way to a service station across a barbed-wire&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:41.520
fence. The station's proprietors, an elderly&nbsp;
couple named Miranda 'Ma' and Julius 'Pop,' state&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.320
that they are from Arkansas. The three abducted&nbsp;
Americans, each from a different region of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.720
country, realise how similar their predicament&nbsp;
is to the 'Manorgate' conspiracy theory.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.840
One of the three eats a poisoned doughnut and&nbsp;
passes out, while Ma and Pop (who are among the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:01.520
captors' ranks) use poison gas to murder a second&nbsp;
and a sawed-off shotgun blast to kill the third.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.480
They then clean up the station in&nbsp;
preparation for the next visitor.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:10.480
Crystal Creasey, an army veteran, is the fourth&nbsp;
prisoner to arrive. She strikes up a discussion&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:14.640
with Ma and Pop, asking for cigarettes and their&nbsp;
whereabouts, which makes the latter uneasy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.480
Crystal then assaults the couple and&nbsp;
murders them with the sawed-off shotgun&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:22.640
they had hidden behind the counter, revealing&nbsp;
that the smokes were too pricey for Arkansas.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.960
She discovers a Croatian licence&nbsp;
plate behind a false Arkansas plate,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.600
as well as a booby-trap attached to the driver's&nbsp;
door, when she inspects the pickup truck outside.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.960
She subsequently meets up with another&nbsp;
prisoner, Gary, a conspiracy theorist podcaster,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.840
and advises him against stealing the truck.&nbsp;
They board a railway car full of refugees Gary&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.080
suspects of being crisis actors, and the&nbsp;
train is soon stormed by Croatian forces.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.720
When Gary attempts to persuade the troops&nbsp;
of Manorgate and the refugees' deception,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.760
a refugee named 'Crisis Mike' reveals to Gary that&nbsp;
he and only he is an actor and one of the hunters,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:00.080
but that the attack was unplanned and offers Gary&nbsp;
a head start in exchange for his cooperation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.360
Gary kills the actor with a grenade he had hidden,&nbsp;
and Crystal is transported to a refugee camp.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.600
At the camp, Crystal encounters Don, another&nbsp;
freed prisoner. Oliver, a U.S. Embassy ambassador&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.880
in Zagreb, comes to transport them to the embassy.&nbsp;
Oliver questions why they were chosen for the hunt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.840
on the way there. Crystal, suspicious, yanks&nbsp;
Oliver from the automobile and runs him over.

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.200
Gary's body is discovered in the trunk, along&nbsp;
with a package labelled 'bribe money' and a map.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.400
One of the hunters was the phoney envoy. The&nbsp;
Jackrabbit and the Box Turtle is a variation of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.600
The Tortoise and the Hare in which the Jackrabbit&nbsp;
kills the Box Turtle after losing. Crystal kills&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.760
the hunters she discovers and wounds their&nbsp;
tactical consultant Sgt. Dale near the envoy's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.160
intended location (which is shown to be close to&nbsp;
where the prisoners first discovered the weapons&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.280
cache and were subsequently slain). Don is asked&nbsp;
if he killed Crystal by Athena over the radio.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.000
Don is killed by Crystal after he refuses&nbsp;
to disarm and points his revolver at her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.240
Crystal tortures and murders Sgt. Dale&nbsp;
in order to learn where Athena is.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.640
Athena's group text conversation was&nbsp;
a prank, according to a flashback.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.400
It was, however, released on the internet,&nbsp;
causing a stir over 'Manorgate.' As a result,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.800
the participants in the group text, whose jobs&nbsp;
have been wrecked, resolve to make Manorgate a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:20.160
reality. They kidnapped persons who shared and&nbsp;
created Manorgate-related internet content.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:25.360
Athena is outraged by a social media post Crystal&nbsp;
made about her, and she insists on being included,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:30.720
dubbing her 'Snowball.' Athena mocks Crystal's&nbsp;
personal past when Crystal confronts her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.640
Crystal informs Athena that she had mistaken&nbsp;
her for another Crystal from her village,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.360
but her middle name is May, not Mae.&nbsp;
Crystal and Athena battle for a long time,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.760
finally impaling each other on the two&nbsp;
blades of a food processor; Athena dies,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.320
but Crystal finds a new lease on life when she&nbsp;
sees a jackrabbit emerge beside Athena's body.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.920
She cauterises her wound, dresses up as Athena,&nbsp;
gets Athena's dog, and boards her private plane.
