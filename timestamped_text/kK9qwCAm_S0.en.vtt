00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:05.299
If you stumbled across a vintage polaroid
camera at a yard sale, and happened to take

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:10.530
some pictures of your friends, only to realize
that it was a haunted camera with a ghost

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.180
in it that comes and kills whoever you took
a picture of, what could you do?

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.119
In this video on Nerd Explains..

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:20.449
I’ll tell you, how to beat the ghost, in,
Polaroid.

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:25.529
We’ll follow the characters, see if they
could’ve made better decisions, and ultimately

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.470
figure out if we can beat the polaroid monster.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.840
For some reason, a teenage girl and her friend
decided to go through their deceased mom’s

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.500
old stuff in her creepy house with no lights
on.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.550
They find her mom’s old polaroid camera
and decide to snap a risque picture for a

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:43.550
boy.

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.500
* (Only he can have a copy of).

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.289
He can take a picture of the polaroid, just
saying.

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:49.360
* I know this isn’t a Star Wars ringtone,
but damn if that didn’t remind me of the

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.360
recon droid.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.420
The friend has to jet, and the girl decides
to stay in the creepy dark house at night

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:54.830
by herself.

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:56.640
* What high school girl would do that?

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.110
I’d have left the house with my friend and
come back the next morning.

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:05.400
After admiring her own model shot, she heads
downstairs to find that Linda left the front

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.440
door open.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.140
* How inconsiderate.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.000
But then again, it’s a creepy old house,
so we might not be as alone as we think.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.420
Call me paranoid, but I think it’s reasonable
to get a little nervous if you find out the

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.830
front door of your house is ajar at night.

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.170
I came home once and my dog started barking
at my dark bedroom, I went and got my gun

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:31.049
and tactically cleared the room and closets
using special forces tactics I saw on Youtube.

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.400
You gotta slice the pie, leave a comment if
you know what i’m talking about.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.250
She then hears the polaroid camera charge
up upstairs, and goes to check it out.

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.391
* I don’t know much about polaroid cameras,
but i’m pretty sure they don’t charge

00:01:44.391 --> 00:01:55.320
up on their own randomly.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:01.030
To randomly and inappropriately use a banana
sundae analogy, if the front door being open

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:13.480
is the split banana, this is three scoops
of get the fuck out of the house ice cream.

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.700
She finds the polaroid of her model shot on
the bed where she left it.

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.020
Except now that the picture has developed,
we can see a silhouette of a person behind

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.020
her.

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.940
* Maybe it was a shadow from a lamp or something,
right guys?

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:34.680
Either way, this is going to be the whipped
cream.

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.930
The electricity in the rackety ass house buzzes
and flickers, shutting off all the lights

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.959
in the house, as if it wasn’t dark enough.

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:46.099
* This is the fudge drizzle.

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:50.650
Seriously though, at this point i’d be out
the fucking window in that room.

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:58.000
Whatever you do, please do not go wandering
the house to check it out.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Sigh.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.849
She goes to wander the house in order to see
what’s going on, asking, “is anybody there.”

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:04.060
* Just FYI.

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:09.510
If you find yourself wandering a dark, creepy,
empty house, asking, is anybody there.

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:14.610
There’s about 95% chance you’re about
to die in the next 60 seconds.

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:19.200
Her heart rate is probably jacked, she has
to be feeling incredibly vulnerable as she

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.700
steps on the creaking floor boards.

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.230
She turns around to go downstairs, and the
ball that she tossed across the room in the

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:38.770
beginning of the movie, falls from the attic
space and bounces over to her.

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:44.180
* This is the nuts sprinkled on the chocolate
drizzle.

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.030
This is like the 5th red flag, you should
be sprinting out the door.

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:50.400
But not this girl.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.849
She goes to pick it up.

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:54.880
And scared shitless, asks, “Linda?

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:01.660
Is that you?

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:05.690
Before she climbs the ladder into the attic
where the ball fell from.

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:11.099
* Can she make any more mistakes, I feel like
i’m losing my mind at how stupid this girl

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:12.099
is.

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:14.709
Who on planet Earth would do what she is doing.

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:20.500
The Grudge came out in 2004, instilling an
unhealthy level of fear of attics that should

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.380
have prevented this.

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:27.270
Once she makes it into the attic, the ladder
randomly falls to the ground without her touching

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:28.270
it.

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:32.810
From the corner of the attic, behind some
plastic tarp, she distinctly hears the horrifying

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:39.220
sound of something or someone wheezing.

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.590
What does she do, goes to check it out of
course.

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:48.280
* This teenage girl is seemingly impervious
to fear and proper decision making skills.

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.990
This is the cherry on top of the sundae.

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:55.140
Can you guess what’s going to happen once
she pulls the tarp back?

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:59.830
Yep, the wheezing polaroid ghost monster grabs
her and kills her.

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:04.530
* This girl did make a metric fuck ton of
horrible decisions, but as we will come to

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:07.620
find out, there really wasn’t much she could
have done.

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:12.520
As usual, the first person to encounter the
apocalypse, villain, monster, or whatever

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.410
is probably toast.

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:16.410
They just don’t know what they’re dealing
with.

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:19.199
The monster has the element of surprise.

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:23.160
Even if she did get away, she’d have most
likely been killed later that night as the

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:24.970
monster followed her.

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:30.250
Flash over to a new protagonist named Bird,
and she’s getting her picture taken at school.

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:31.300
* Thankfully not by a polaroid.

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:32.300
“Look, it's a scarf girl.”

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:33.300
Sick burn.

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.580
She works at an antique shop, where the shopkeeper's
nephew picked up an SX-70 vintage polaroid

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:39.220
camera from a yard sale.

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:43.050
A yard sale, from the house where a young
girl was murdered.

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.360
She takes his picture with it to test it out.

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:49.690
But before the picture develops he tries to
kiss her so she bolts.

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:53.840
When she gets home, she tries to take a picture
of her dog with the SX-70, her dog starts

00:05:53.840 --> 00:06:01.039
to freak out and whimper at the sight of the
camera.

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:04.180
Before she can snap the picture, her friend
interrupts her.

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:05.180
* Phew.

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:06.560
Thought the dog was about to get it.

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:10.290
Later on, when she’s going to a party she
pulls out the picture of her coworker.

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:11.720
It’s developed now.

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.060
There’s a silhouette of a person.

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:20.240
* This is the first time Bird see’s something
odd, but it could just be a smudge or old

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.330
film, so there’s nothing to make us alarmed.

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:28.030
Back at the antique shop, Tyler is still there,
testing and pricing old shit.

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:32.580
He pulls out the Kodak Carousel, but instead
of it being a time machine to a place he knew

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:35.702
he was loved, it’s an opening from hell
that brings him death.

00:06:35.702 --> 00:06:36.702
As he clicks the carousel back and forth,
the silhouette appears.

00:06:36.702 --> 00:06:46.550
He grabs a hammer and pulls the screen down,
but nothing is there.

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:57.510
As he turns around, a wheezing person underneath
the screen stands up and attacks him.

00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:01.889
* Like our original protagonist, there was
really nothing Tyler could have done to prevent

00:07:01.889 --> 00:07:02.889
his death.

00:07:02.889 --> 00:07:03.889
Sorry Tyler.

00:07:03.889 --> 00:07:08.419
Back at the costume party, Bird picks a card
from a sexy fortune teller.

00:07:08.419 --> 00:07:10.180
It’s a card of Death.

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:11.180
Foreshadowing..

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:16.480
Her friends try to take a group picture, but
Bird says, wait no, let me take it with my

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:17.600
polaroid camera.

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:20.790
Bird snaps the picture of all four of her
friends.

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:26.210
As the flash goes off, she immediately notices
a strikingly similar shadow to the one she

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:28.759
saw in the polaroid of Tyler.

00:07:28.759 --> 00:07:33.990
She checks out the developing picture, and,
despite the shadow in the camera flash, there’s

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:36.410
no shadowy figure in this picture.

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:43.240
Avery shows up and takes a selfie with the
same camera, just before the police show up.

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:45.389
They aren’t there to break up the party
though.

00:07:45.389 --> 00:07:49.520
At the police station, Bird finds out that
Tyler was murdered that night.

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:53.270
While she’s grieving, she picks up the polaroid
that she took of Tyler.

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:55.699
This time, the shadow in it is gone.

00:07:55.699 --> 00:07:56.699
Weird.

00:07:56.699 --> 00:07:59.370
She compares it to the picture of Avery and
the group photo.

00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:01.880
There’s still no shadow in the group photo.

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:05.500
But in Avery’s, it clearly looks like the
shape of a person.

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:10.470
* We know for a fact that nothing was standing
behind her, nothing should have cast that

00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:11.470
shadow.

00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:15.449
Before, it seemed like it could’ve been
an issue with the camera or film that is causing

00:08:15.449 --> 00:08:16.880
weird marks.

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:21.300
But Avery’s picture is really hard to misconstrue
as a random smudge.

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:25.120
* The shadow in Tyler’s picture disappearing
is odd as well.

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:30.500
* What is it with these dark ass houses, does
electricity cost a fortune there or something?

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:34.789
And what is it with these teenagers that live
in creepy old houses by themselves.

00:08:34.789 --> 00:08:38.699
Seriously, this is like a 4 story victorian
mansion.

00:08:38.699 --> 00:08:56.040
Either way, Avery has about as much wits as
the first girl, and gets her head torqued

00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:58.339
by the phantom.

00:08:58.339 --> 00:09:01.589
The morning after the party, Bird gets a call
from her friend.

00:09:01.589 --> 00:09:03.860
She finds out that Avery is dead.

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:07.190
They think she died after falling down the
stairs by accident.

00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:12.399
Bird knows something is very wrong, and these
deaths might be connected to the shadowy figure

00:09:12.399 --> 00:09:15.370
that’s appearing and disappearing in the
polaroids.

00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:17.450
She goes to check Avery’s picture.

00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:19.699
The creepy figure is gone.

00:09:19.699 --> 00:09:24.100
* These pictures are all completely developed,
nothing should be changing in them.

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:28.560
A mysterious shadowy figure moving between
pictures is not normal.

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:31.069
The thing appears in the group photo next.

00:09:31.069 --> 00:09:35.660
It seems to be killing in the order of the
pictures taken, and after it finishes killing

00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:40.369
whoever’s in that picture, it moves to whoever’s
in the next most recent picture.

00:09:40.369 --> 00:09:46.249
* I mean sure, a haunted camera killing people
seems dumb and far-fetched, but these deaths

00:09:46.249 --> 00:09:51.009
and the pictures are way to correlated for
us to just pass it off as nothing.

00:09:51.009 --> 00:09:55.730
* Especially considering that two of our friends
were found dead on the same day, the day we

00:09:55.730 --> 00:10:00.360
got the camera, and they happened to have
their picture taken by this camera.

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:04.769
* At this point, I would lock that camera
up somewhere nobody else could find or use

00:10:04.769 --> 00:10:07.160
it, and separate the camera from the film.

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:09.839
I’d also put some tape over the lens.

00:10:09.839 --> 00:10:14.059
Numerous times in the movie, the friends just
leave the camera on the table.

00:10:14.059 --> 00:10:22.420
It’s magically charged up before, what’s
to say it wouldn’t take a picture by itself.

00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:27.329
If the camera was pointed at someone random,
they’d be marked for death.

00:10:27.329 --> 00:10:32.420
Doing this wouldn’t stop the monster or
save their lives, but it would prevent any

00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:33.979
more people from getting killed.

00:10:33.979 --> 00:10:38.499
* I wouldn’t destroy the camera right away,
because we did take a picture of our friends.

00:10:38.499 --> 00:10:41.360
They are still potentially in danger.

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:44.040
We don’t know if destroying the camera would
save them.

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:48.459
The camera might hold the key to stopping
whatever’s going on.

00:10:48.459 --> 00:10:51.170
Well, despite what I just said.

00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:55.049
Bird throws the camera at the wall, hoping
to break it I guess.

00:10:55.049 --> 00:10:58.620
Some type of shockwave pulses out when the
camera hits the wall.

00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:01.199
* That’s… not normal at all.

00:11:01.199 --> 00:11:05.059
This camera, ain’t a normal camera, that’s
for sure.

00:11:05.059 --> 00:11:08.999
* Considering what’s been happening, I’d
be tempted to take the camera to some scientists

00:11:08.999 --> 00:11:13.329
to study what the fuck is emitted a shockwave
from it, and how both people that had their

00:11:13.329 --> 00:11:16.170
picture died in the same day.

00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:20.660
Surely it’d be easy to prove that the camera
was haunted, I mean all you need to do to

00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:23.639
prove it is throw the camera against the wall
again.

00:11:23.639 --> 00:11:28.100
Bird goes to school and her friend gives her
the inside scoop on Avery’s death.

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:42.040
Apparently, they found her with her head completely
turned backwards, exorcist style.

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:45.980
* Now I know the police don’t have much
to go off of here, which is why they ruled

00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:48.190
it as a possible accident.

00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:53.209
But heads can’t physically turn around 180
degrees when falling down the stairs.

00:11:53.209 --> 00:11:58.470
A broken neck, sure, but not exorcist style.

00:11:58.470 --> 00:12:02.739
Knowing what Bird knows, something killed
her, and that something must be related to

00:12:02.739 --> 00:12:03.929
the polaroids.

00:12:03.929 --> 00:12:09.649
Bird tells her friends her theory, how a shadowy
figure was killing each person in the picture,

00:12:09.649 --> 00:12:12.509
before moving to the next person in the next
picture.

00:12:12.509 --> 00:12:14.519
Naturally, nobody believes her.

00:12:14.519 --> 00:12:19.250
* Then, well, let’s just say it is quite
unmistakable that a supernatural entity is

00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:20.250
after them, and Bird’s theory is 100% correct.

00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:23.350
They try to destroy the picture by lighting
it on fire.

00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:27.970
The problem is that the polaroid has some
voodoo shit going on, and as the picture burns

00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:31.279
up, everybody in the picture starts bursting
into flames.

00:12:31.279 --> 00:12:34.179
Bird stamps out the burning picture, saving
everyone.

00:12:34.179 --> 00:12:38.509
Then, like some harry potter shit, the picture
magically repairs itself.

00:12:38.509 --> 00:12:44.100
* Okay so the first order of business is to
ensure that the polaroids are secure.

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:48.889
If you drop it and somewhere down the road
it gets damaged or destroyed, well, whoever’s

00:12:48.889 --> 00:12:52.319
in that picture will get damaged and destroyed
as well.

00:12:52.319 --> 00:12:56.290
Interestingly, the picture only repaired itself
once the fire was put out.

00:12:56.290 --> 00:13:02.679
But, if they didn’t stamp the fire out,
the whole picture could be destroyed.

00:13:02.679 --> 00:13:05.799
* Secondly and obviously, no more pictures.

00:13:05.799 --> 00:13:10.779
* We definitely know something is out to kill
us, so what else could help us stop this thing.

00:13:10.779 --> 00:13:15.600
* Both Tyler and Avery were killed when they
were in dark, isolated areas.

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:21.319
It’s best to stay together, and stay in
well-lit public areas from now on.

00:13:21.319 --> 00:13:26.139
This will be a challenge, as the lighting
is fucking horrible in this town.

00:13:26.139 --> 00:13:32.059
* It has supernatural abilities, so we can’t
assume that any modern weapons or barriers

00:13:32.059 --> 00:13:40.119
could stop it.

00:13:40.119 --> 00:13:44.720
* At this point we really don’t have enough
information to stop this threat, only some

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:47.519
ways to not be immediately killed by it.

00:13:47.519 --> 00:13:52.110
We could destroy the camera, but again, we
don’t know if it will stop the monster.

00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:55.970
We could be damning everyone who already had
their picture taken.

00:13:55.970 --> 00:14:00.489
* There is enough evidence of a supernatural
force haunting the camera and causing the

00:14:00.489 --> 00:14:03.089
deaths of people whose picture is taken.

00:14:03.089 --> 00:14:07.389
We could easily go to the authorities with
all the evidence at this point, which would

00:14:07.389 --> 00:14:13.170
launch a massive investigation of the situation,
camera, history, people involved, and massive

00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:16.620
amounts of security for everyone whose picture
was taken.

00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:21.649
I mean, all you’d need to do is light the
picture on fire again and watch your arm magically

00:14:21.649 --> 00:14:22.939
burst into flames.

00:14:22.939 --> 00:14:26.569
That’s an extreme example but you get my
point.

00:14:26.569 --> 00:14:30.929
Getting as many big brains looking at this
situation as possible is your best bet at

00:14:30.929 --> 00:14:34.069
figuring out what this weakness is.

00:14:34.069 --> 00:14:39.130
You could voluntarily take a picture of yourself,
causing you to be the most immediate target,

00:14:39.130 --> 00:14:43.970
then with the might of the national guard
and FBI, set up a trap to test what weapons

00:14:43.970 --> 00:14:44.970
work.

00:14:44.970 --> 00:14:47.850
Better yet, the camera seemed to scare animals.

00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:52.329
You could take a picture of an animal or find
a terminally ill person who would volunteer

00:14:52.329 --> 00:14:53.569
to be the bait.

00:14:53.569 --> 00:14:57.009
* Let’s continue as if we decided to not
involve the world.

00:14:57.009 --> 00:15:02.190
We’d probably want to find out as much as
we can about the previous owners of the camera,

00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:04.639
or what circumstances led to this.

00:15:04.639 --> 00:15:09.899
A camera doesn’t just become haunted and
obtain supernatural powers for no reason,

00:15:09.899 --> 00:15:13.149
there has to be some significant, horrific
event that occurred.

00:15:13.149 --> 00:15:18.459
We’d also want to start finding any information
on the internet about haunted objects.

00:15:18.459 --> 00:15:21.259
Why do they become haunted, how to stop a
haunted object.

00:15:21.259 --> 00:15:25.189
* It’s a good thing Bird and crew are thinking
what I'm thinking, except that they split

00:15:25.189 --> 00:15:27.929
up and all went to dark, isolated areas.

00:15:27.929 --> 00:15:31.489
Bird and Connor go back to the antique shop
to grab the camera bag.

00:15:31.489 --> 00:15:34.389
Maybe there is something else the camera came
with that could help.

00:15:34.389 --> 00:15:39.019
Bird, thinking she’s safe since she hasn’t
had her picture taken, goes into the store.

00:15:39.019 --> 00:15:41.939
She grabs the bag, but the thing is there
stalking her.

00:15:41.939 --> 00:15:45.850
She sprints out of there, and when she gets
back to the car, Connor points out that Bird

00:15:45.850 --> 00:15:49.649
is actually in the picture too, as a reflection
in it.

00:15:49.649 --> 00:15:51.939
AKA, she’s fucked too.

00:15:51.939 --> 00:15:57.859
* Well, it’s clearly a real monster, not
just a final destination force of nature.

00:15:57.859 --> 00:16:02.709
We also can confirm that it’s not a person
stalking them, this thing has a demented claw

00:16:02.709 --> 00:16:03.709
hand.

00:16:03.709 --> 00:16:04.709
Also, there always seems to be some form of
electrical disturbance that occurs before

00:16:04.709 --> 00:16:05.709
you get attacked.

00:16:05.709 --> 00:16:06.709
* Jesus, even the hospital is dark as fuck.

00:16:06.709 --> 00:16:12.089
And of course this dude is going to go into
the darkest most isolated room in the dark

00:16:12.089 --> 00:16:16.889
hospital, by himself, while leaving Mina alone
in her hospital room.

00:16:16.889 --> 00:16:17.889
Bro.

00:16:17.889 --> 00:16:23.940
This thing is killing people when they are
at their most isolated, vulnerable position.

00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:29.089
You’re making yourself an easy target here.

00:16:29.089 --> 00:16:34.399
Devin eventually returns to his room to get
jumpscared by his dead girlfriend falling

00:16:34.399 --> 00:16:48.369
from the rafters with a cord around her neck.

00:16:48.369 --> 00:16:51.259
The police chalk it up to suicide.

00:16:51.259 --> 00:16:54.319
Excellent work boys, lets pack it up and go
home.

00:16:54.319 --> 00:16:59.279
* Mina’s death could have been avoided if
they stuck to well-lit, public areas and stayed

00:16:59.279 --> 00:17:00.279
together.

00:17:00.279 --> 00:17:05.689
Yah she had bad burns on her arm, but there
is a much bigger problem, ya know, a killer

00:17:05.689 --> 00:17:07.790
ghost stalking them.

00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:13.280
Normal hospitals would typically be fine,
but in this town it’s about as safe as a

00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:14.280
crackhouse.

00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:19.350
In the camera bag they find a police tag marking
this camera as evidence of a homicide crime

00:17:19.350 --> 00:17:20.350
scene.

00:17:20.350 --> 00:17:24.040
They go to the library to get more info on
this crime from old newspapers.

00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:28.909
Apparently that’s something libraries used
to store, didn’t know that.

00:17:28.909 --> 00:17:34.669
They find out that an old photography teacher
abducted, tortured, and murdered three kids,

00:17:34.669 --> 00:17:36.389
while taking pictures of them.

00:17:36.389 --> 00:17:39.120
His name matched the initials on the camera.

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:41.820
He was killed before taken into custody.

00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:47.080
The remaining three friends meet up at a diner,
and Bird drops some important photography

00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:48.470
knowledge on them.

00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:52.670
When you develop photos, heat and light can
mess up the images.

00:17:52.670 --> 00:17:57.759
The monster might only develop and is able
to physically appear in the world where it

00:17:57.759 --> 00:17:58.960
is dark.

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:02.570
* Considering all of the encounters with the
entity so far, they’ve all been cold and

00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:05.340
dark places, this seems accurate.

00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:08.899
At least it’s the best defense they’ve
come up with so far.

00:18:08.899 --> 00:18:13.289
Right now, they need to just hang out in hot,
well lit areas until morning.

00:18:13.289 --> 00:18:19.269
Then, stock up on oil lamps, torches, lighters,
and flashlights before heading into dark,

00:18:19.269 --> 00:18:22.019
cold, abandoned schools to continue your investigation.

00:18:22.019 --> 00:18:28.049
I say torches because flashlights might be
unreliable with the whole electrical disturbance

00:18:28.049 --> 00:18:30.590
thing, and they don’t produce heat.

00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:35.220
As long as you all have a steady supply of
torches, you can safely continue trying to

00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:37.220
figure out how to defeat it.

00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:41.809
Kasey also brings up the idea that the camera
could be cursed, and that it absorbed the

00:18:41.809 --> 00:18:45.950
energy of it’s owner because the owner has
unfinished business.

00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:50.179
Devin freaks out due to Mina's death, and
he and Connor tussle for the camera.

00:18:50.179 --> 00:18:54.110
In the heat of the moment, Connor accidentally
snaps a photo of Devin.

00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:59.659
They check out the pictures, and the ghost
moved from the group photo to Devin’s polaroid.

00:18:59.659 --> 00:19:00.799
He’s next.

00:19:00.799 --> 00:19:06.090
* This confirms that the ghost prioritizes
the most recent picture taken.

00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:11.080
Devin continues to freak out, threatening
to use the camera against everyone else first.

00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:16.350
Kasey, using the voodoo shit, stabs Devin’s
polaroid with a pencil, causing Devin's hand

00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:19.730
to be stabbed in real life, and the camera
to be dropped.

00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:24.620
Devin gets taken to the police for hitting
a police officer that was trying to intervene.

00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:29.350
While Devin gets arrested and jailed, Bird
and Connor decide to take their story to the

00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:32.450
cops, and they proceed to not believe anything.

00:19:32.450 --> 00:19:34.919
But wait, where the fuck is Kasey.

00:19:34.919 --> 00:19:37.130
God damn guys stop splitting up.

00:19:37.130 --> 00:19:43.059
Kasey is now alone and vulnerable, but it’s
chill because Devin’s the target for now.

00:19:43.059 --> 00:19:46.809
Unfortunately for Devin, and like we talked
about earlier.

00:19:46.809 --> 00:19:50.119
Barriers like a jail cell don’t stop the
ghost at all.

00:19:50.119 --> 00:19:53.960
* Devin was an idiot for freaking out and
punching a police officer.

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:59.200
By now they knew that a ghost was killing
them in dark, isolated, cold places.

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:04.029
Punching a police officer is pretty much a
straight drive to the jail cell, which is

00:20:04.029 --> 00:20:06.759
dark, isolated, and cold.

00:20:06.759 --> 00:20:24.500
It was pretty much a death sentence.

00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:27.360
* As far as what he could have done to survive
in that situation.

00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:30.700
Well, anything to get out of the cell as soon
as possible.

00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:35.100
I’d start hurting myself and beating my
head against the wall, the police would have

00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:42.480
to put me on 24/7 monitoring or take me out
of the cell.

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:56.990
The real big brain move would’ve been to
hide my lighter in my underwear 

00:20:56.990 --> 00:21:01.340
and once I was in the cell and the monster
came for me, I’d pull it out and light my

00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:02.970
clothes on fire.

00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:06.809
Since the monster can’t deal with heat and
light, it’d prevent my execution.

00:21:06.809 --> 00:21:11.630
A fire would also set off the fire alarms
alerting nearby policemen and bringing the

00:21:11.630 --> 00:21:12.730
fire department.

00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:14.840
Hopefully that would buy me enough time.

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:17.659
Bird and Connor drive to Mrs. Sable’s house.

00:21:17.659 --> 00:21:23.400
She tells them a story about how 4 kids teased
their daughter, causing her to commit suicide.

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:28.820
In revenge, her husband tortured and murdered
them, taking pictures of their mutilated bodies

00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:30.129
with the polaroid camera.

00:21:30.129 --> 00:21:36.390
During the nice chat with Ms. Sable, Connor
notices that the ghost moved from Devin’s

00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:38.139
picture, back to the group photo.

00:21:38.139 --> 00:21:39.610
Welp, Devin’s dead.

00:21:39.610 --> 00:21:45.009
* Okay, so he only killed three kids, but
there were four kids.

00:21:45.009 --> 00:21:50.850
Bird and Connor break into the school to figure
out who the 4th kid was, to get some answers.

00:21:50.850 --> 00:21:54.950
They find Kasey, seriously, where the fuck
was she this whole time.

00:21:54.950 --> 00:21:58.990
They find out the name of the kid who wasn’t
killed, it was the cop.

00:21:58.990 --> 00:22:03.320
Connor, believing Ms. Sable’s sob story,
takes a picture of the cop.

00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:07.889
Their hope is that by wrapping up the monster’s
unfinished business, they could end this thing

00:22:07.889 --> 00:22:09.440
before they all get killed.

00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:12.070
He gives them his side of the story.

00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:17.260
That Mr. Sable was an abusive father, and
took inappropriate pictures of his daughter.

00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:21.539
That they tried to help the daughter and get
her away from him, and he killed them for

00:22:21.539 --> 00:22:22.559
it.

00:22:22.559 --> 00:22:23.580
* Oooh.

00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:25.370
Sorry for taking your picture then.

00:22:25.370 --> 00:22:27.610
This is when the all out brawl happens.

00:22:27.610 --> 00:22:30.230
The polaroid ghost shows up to the school.

00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:40.830
They try shooting it but this thing is like
the t1000 terminator.

00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:44.850
Like the picture, unless the thing is fully
destroyed it will just repair itself.

00:22:44.850 --> 00:22:47.510
And it can shape its arm into a sword.

00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:48.789
Side theory.

00:22:48.789 --> 00:22:54.019
Bird is the leader of the resistance and John
Sable is actually a terminator sent from the

00:22:54.019 --> 00:22:55.440
past to kill her.

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:59.330
Sending terminators back from the future is
too predictable at this point.

00:22:59.330 --> 00:23:04.029
The ghost grabs the cop's picture, uses the
voodoo shit, and rips the polaroid of the

00:23:04.029 --> 00:23:05.540
cop in half.

00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:07.580
Splitting him in two in real life.

00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:11.730
* If they had gotten the torches and flashlights
like I had mentioned earlier, they could have

00:23:11.730 --> 00:23:13.399
avoided the cops death.

00:23:13.399 --> 00:23:17.460
Once the monster shows up, light the torches
and shine the flashlights at it.

00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:22.269
This should dissolve the monster for now,
then recover the polaroid and keep it safe.

00:23:22.269 --> 00:23:25.960
Bird and Kasey make a run for the showers
to turn up the heat.

00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:32.480
It stops the monster like Bird said it would.

00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:37.289
Bird then, with her finishing move, takes
a picture of the fully formed monster, and

00:23:37.289 --> 00:23:39.360
uses the voodoo against it.

00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:46.860
She crumples up the picture of the monster,
turning it into a pretzel.

00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:53.309
Then she lights it on fire.

00:23:53.309 --> 00:23:58.019
And since the picture only repairs itself
once the damage is stopped, letting the entire

00:23:58.019 --> 00:24:03.740
picture burn up into ashes causes the ghost
to be completely incinerated, stopping it

00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:04.740
for good.

00:24:04.740 --> 00:24:08.590
We can see that the ghost is gone from all
the other polaroids too.

00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:12.820
* I thought the monster was going to have
to kill itself, since it kills whoever had

00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:14.259
their picture taken.

00:24:14.259 --> 00:24:16.970
But nope, you have to take its picture and
voodoo it.

00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:21.909
I think Bird got pretty lucky here, this strategy
could easily have not worked.

00:24:21.909 --> 00:24:26.399
It definitely would be on the list of things
to try once we could ensure our safety with

00:24:26.399 --> 00:24:30.210
torches and lights, but not something I’d
bank on with my life.

00:24:30.210 --> 00:24:31.529
* After incinerating the ghost.

00:24:31.529 --> 00:24:36.440
I would go visit a maximum security prison
and take a picture of all the inmates.

00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:38.929
Or someone that deserves death.

00:24:38.929 --> 00:24:42.210
Then, set an alert for any mentions of their
death.

00:24:42.210 --> 00:24:46.149
Just in case it didn’t kill the monster,
we’d be able to get a little forewarning.

00:24:46.149 --> 00:24:49.520
Who would you take a picture of, let me know
in the comments.

00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:53.470
To recap, I think we could have saved some
lives here.

00:24:53.470 --> 00:24:58.080
While the first girl, Tyler, and Avery were
toast, the rest could have been saved if they

00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:00.030
made some better decisions.

00:25:00.030 --> 00:25:05.289
Even though it wasn’t 100% clear it would
work, staying in well-lit public areas, and

00:25:05.289 --> 00:25:10.080
staying together is an incredibly obvious,
reasonable, and effective strategy.

00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:14.360
You could argue for and against taking the
camera to the authorities.

00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:18.700
On one hand, they could help you figure out
what’s going on, and give you the resources

00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:20.289
to fight the monster.

00:25:20.289 --> 00:25:23.900
There would also be a lot of interesting technology
that could come from it.

00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:28.769
On the other hand, the CIA would probably
have gained a super-weapon for their assassination

00:25:28.769 --> 00:25:29.769
program.

00:25:29.769 --> 00:25:34.200
I can see them mounting the polaroid camera
to a predator drone, taking pictures of people

00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:39.860
and letting the ghost kill them silently and
for free.

00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:40.860
What do you think?

00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:43.080
How would you beat the polaroid ghost?

00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:44.360
Let me know in the comments.

00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:48.269
If you enjoy these how to beat videos, consider
subscribing.

00:25:48.269 --> 00:25:52.190
If you have a movie or monster you’d like
me to talk about beating, let me know.

00:25:52.190 --> 00:25:53.669
Thanks for watching, later.

00:25:53.669 --> 00:25:58.740
And remember, don’t take pictures of yourself
with old polaroid cameras.
