behind free city before walter's current boss&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.640
antwan stole their code and bastardized the game&nbsp;
into his own thing to create a soulless franchise&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.440
millie visits walter and plans to get&nbsp;
evidence of antwan's crimes because she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.160
knows that proof of their code is hidden in a&nbsp;
safe house inside the game which she is trying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.920
to infiltrate while playing as molotov girl guy&nbsp;
later finds molotov girl outside the safe house&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.160
although he wants to join her in her mission&nbsp;
until the guards start shooting at them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:06.400
using a portal gun they arrive elsewhere malatov&nbsp;
girl goes to her amory and tells guy he cannot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:12.320
because he has a low level one to be exact&nbsp;
while molotov girl is at a higher level guy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:17.520
then starts taking on missions with the glasses&nbsp;
and pulls off several heroic acts like returning&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:23.280
stolen money and pulling kids away from traffic to&nbsp;
boost his level players in real life take notice&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:29.200
in guy soon becomes a viral sensation called blue&nbsp;
shirt guy even appearing as an answer on jeopardy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.960
guy tries to get buddy to join him after stealing&nbsp;
another pair of sunglasses from a bank robber&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:40.000
but buddy thinks it's too dangerous with walter's&nbsp;
help malatov girl makes attempt to get into the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.600
safe house she grabs the proof clip and as&nbsp;
she heads back security alarm is triggered&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:51.520
making security guards start to attack her she&nbsp;
drops the clip and just as she is almost killed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:56.400
guy crashes through on a motorcycle and helps her&nbsp;
fight off the villains before escaping on a hang&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:03.200
glider later on the two hang out and eat bubblegum&nbsp;
ice cream which both consider to be underrated at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:09.200
the end of their date guy kisses molotov girl&nbsp;
which surprises millie meanwhile walter starts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:14.080
to notice something unusual about the codes of&nbsp;
the non-player characters he brings the info to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:18.960
millie reporting that the barista and the coffee&nbsp;
shop learn how to make a cappuccino through trial&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:24.160
and error while a blonde bombshell character wrote&nbsp;
a book on gender roles after she encountered guy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:29.840
and was influenced to follow her own path this&nbsp;
proves that antwin stole walter at milla's code&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.640
because their idea for the game that turned into&nbsp;
free city would have had the non-player characters&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:38.480
grow and develop over time as they&nbsp;
adapt and that's what guy has been doing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:44.400
he also warns millie that the current world of&nbsp;
free city will be lost once the sequel launches&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:49.760
antwen catches wind of guy and wants his employees&nbsp;
to keep guy on because of how popular he is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:55.200
the company is set to launch free city 2 which&nbsp;
antwan wants out in two days time despite&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:59.520
not being fully coded and still glitchy and&nbsp;
he makes it worse by telling walter that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:04.240
game is not backward compatible with the first&nbsp;
game so most of the characters won't return for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:09.680
the sequel milly goes back into the game to bring&nbsp;
guy to the central hub where other players gather&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:15.520
revealing to him that he is just a character in a&nbsp;
video game once the realization hits him guy goes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:20.560
into a funk and loses his cheerful demeanor he&nbsp;
goes to buddy's house to talk to him about his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:25.920
newfound existential crisis and buddy attempts to&nbsp;
cheer him up by assuring him that the moment they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:31.520
are experiencing together is real but he joins&nbsp;
guy as he decides to help millie and get the clip&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:37.200
she wants the guard avatar is excited to meet god&nbsp;
as the player in the real world reacts to seeing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:43.600
him he basically lets guy rob him and take what he&nbsp;
wants even asking god to kill him but god refuses&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:49.440
to do so he brings the clip to millie which is&nbsp;
the evidence she has been looking for guys no kill&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:54.000
demeanor catches on with players including&nbsp;
popular streamers like ninja and pokemane&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:59.280
however antwan starts to get pissed off and&nbsp;
thinks that guy will ruin sales for free city too&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.200
mouser suggests that he reboot the server in&nbsp;
the game guy and millie see the clip which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:09.520
contains information about an island that&nbsp;
proves hers and walter's code is in the game&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:15.280
just as guy mentions that he has seen the island&nbsp;
before the game is rebooted which causes guy to go&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:21.520
back to before he became self-aware millie is able&nbsp;
to log back on but guy doesn't remember who she is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:26.000
she asks walter for help and he tells her that&nbsp;
the character he made that guy is based off of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.040
is a love worn non-player character who is always&nbsp;
searching for his dream girl and he just needs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:36.560
something to help trigger the code millie as&nbsp;
molotov girl goes to guy's workplace forces&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:41.360
him out and kisses him and it brings back all&nbsp;
his memories including where you saw the island&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:47.120
the image of it is reflected off the blinds in&nbsp;
his apartment and with that info walter figures&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:52.480
that the island is just beyond the city's horizon&nbsp;
guy and Millie then round up all the non-player&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:57.760
characters in free city to inspire them to migrate&nbsp;
to the island and follow their own choices instead&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:02.240
of what they were coded to do with all the&nbsp;
non-player characters gone the players in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:08.080
city are left confused and when soon catches wind&nbsp;
of molotov girl and learns that millie is involved&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:13.120
he orders mouser to delete her and guy&nbsp;
for good mouser starts to manipulate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:17.440
the game's environment to close in on them&nbsp;
as guy tries driving them outside the city&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:24.000
players all over the world are tuned in to watch&nbsp;
the saga unfold walter intervenes and helps create&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.880
a ramp to escape the destruction they make it to&nbsp;
the beach walter helps create a bridge for them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:34.160
but molotov girl starts to get deleted&nbsp;
antwan then has his employees launch dude&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:39.600
a bigger stronger dumber version of god that isn't&nbsp;
fully finished but is antwan's last ditch effort&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:45.040
to get rid of god but he arrives to help but get&nbsp;
knocked out while guy gets tossed around and gets&nbsp;&nbsp;

gets the sunglasses and throws him a guy who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:14.320

the world as god does guy and buddy start running&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:19.200
toward the island at which point antwan starts&nbsp;
to lose it and takes mauser to the server room&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:25.280
where he now plans to completely erase free city&nbsp;

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:31.200
walter so antwan begins smashing everything with&nbsp;
an axe causing the city environment to be deleted&nbsp;&nbsp;

he cannot make it far he tells guy that he has had&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:42.720
the best day of his life thanks to him until he is&nbsp;
also deleted guy runs fast enough until he finally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:47.200
breaks through the barrier and makes it to the&nbsp;
island which is then revealed to the non-player&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:52.560
characters and the players in the real world milli&nbsp;
makes it to the almost totally destroyed server&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:57.120
room and makes a deal with antwan when to let&nbsp;
her have the code to the game while he can keep&nbsp;&nbsp;
