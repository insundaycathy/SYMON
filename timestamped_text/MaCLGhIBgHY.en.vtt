00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.240
Welcome to Cinema Summary, ladies and gentlemen.

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.320
Now let me tell you a story about 2
stinking rats crawling around

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.380
South Boston’s criminal underworld.

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:19.320
Ya get me? Okay.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.000
Because this The Departed

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.700
So the movie takes place in Boston, where

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.160
we follow Collin Sullivan.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.990
Who we meet initially as a boy, who is sort
of brought up by this guy, Frank Costello,

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:33.760
a real piece of work and all around Irish-American
mobster.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.720
Someone you really don’t want to mess with.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.320
When Collin gets old enough he studies at
the police academy.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.739
But he’s not the only one studying here:
This is Billy Castigan Jr.

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:46.310
and both of them graduate and become officers of the law.

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:50.880
But suspiciously, our boy Collin has still
got ties with Frank

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.240
even as he becomes a detective.
But then again, so does Billy.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:59.670
Because the thing about Billy is that his family – his uncle and father – were in with the Irish mob

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.700
But him? He’s trying to get away from it all.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:06.040
But that doesn’t stop people giving him a hard time when
he tries to apply for a State Trooper position

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.140
Why are you pretending to be a cop?

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.920
As Sergeant Dignam over here is very keen to supply

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.340
As opposed to Collin, whose warmly welcomed
to the Special Investigations Unit, whose

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.030
sole mission is to bring down the Costello
crime empire.

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:21.909
Collin is an investigator.

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:25.240
Whereas Billy has a different gig that's much more difficult

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.280
He is an undercover cop.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.930
and with a 'colorful' family background and a false
conviction here.

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.960
He’s the perfect undercover agent, willing
to go the whole nine yards of being in prison

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.240
in order to bring down Frank's empire

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.189
When he finally gets out he tries to get in
good with the criminal element.

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.829
Whereas Collin’s cushy investigation has him
trying to figure out where a bunch of microchips

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:48.240
are being transported around Boston by Frank,

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.120
and in the office, he starts a little romance with
Madolyn, a police psychologist.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.460
Whereas Billy is more or less fortunate, having
a run in with Frank who rightfully suspects

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.400
Billy of being an undercover cop.

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.720
"Are you still a cop!?"
"NO!"

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.280
But Billy manages to get him off his back.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.420
Or at least his arm.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.840
and gets close to working with Frank and his inner ring

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.729
although his investigation is redirected to focus on

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.420
some microchips that Frank is selling to China.

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.420
The same microchips that Collin is investigating,

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.740
who just so happens to be heading
his own subunit of the SIU

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.100
He got promoted, which is good for a snake
in the grass, like Collin.

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.390
But it’s after having a session with Madolyn
(and a potential invitation to a cup of coffee),

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.049
that Billy finds out from Dignam that Frank
has a mole in the SIU.

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:37.269
Speaking of Collin, he’s going in with the
SIU to do a sting operation on the microchips,

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:38.820
Frank is trying to sell.

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:43.080
With Collin’s team standing by for Captain
Queenan’s inside man (a.k.a. Billy)

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.980
to give them a call to green light the operation.

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.850
If they do this right: It’ll be a huge hit
against Frank Costello.

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:54.620
Though that might be problem since Collin is here,
and he warns Frank that the cops are onto him.

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.739
Explicitly telling him to turn off their cellphones.

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:01.220
But that’s the not the only problem, the
FBI is in on this operation

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.980
but they screwed up! their
 surveillance cameras have a blindspot.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.620
They cannot see the actual transaction of
microchips and with Frank’s men having their

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.980
cellphones turned off, Billy can’t make
a call.

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:17.540
But he can send a text, telling Queenan, the
buyer of the microchips is there.

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.630
But that’s all they can do and the trade
goes off without a hitch.

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.110
But now, Collin and Billy both know that a
mole exists.

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:28.880
That Frank has a spy in the SIU and that Queenan
has a spy in Frank’s inner ring.

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.840
What they don’t know is who the mole is.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:37.220
With Billy himself finding out from 'someone',
that Costello is a protected FBI informant.

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:42.560
Which is why he never gets busted: Costello 
gives up information to the FBI about criminals

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.900
and they make sure he stay on the streets
and not in jail.

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.739
It’s intel that Billy gives to Queenan
as soon as he can.

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:53.170
Though its after this, that Billy is called
in by Mr. French, an associate of Frank’s,

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:58.889
to write down his real name, his social security,
his bank account, and license numbers.

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:03.660
Collin is tasked with smoking out the mole
in SIU and that night, Billy goes after Frank,

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.100
trying to get back the envelope full 
of his personal information.

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.919
Frank gives Collin the envelopes and
Collin leaves with Billy in pursuit.

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:15.509
Though by the end of the night neither of them know
who the mole is and after being unable to

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:18.210
find any info on any of Frank’s crew.

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:20.760
Collin has Queenan followed to a meeting with
Billy

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.500
and calls up Frank’s guys to take them out.

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.320
But Queenan distracts them long enough to
get Billy out of there only to wind up dead.

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.100
Thrown out of a window

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:34.500
When Frank’s guys try to escape, they're fired upon by 
the cops who were tailing Queenan who manage

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.500
to hit Delahunt, one of Frank’s guys.

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:43.250
and now with Queenan dead, everything that he had on
him is stored into evidence including his cellphone

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:44.630
used to contact Billy.

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:47.660
and Collin tries to get Billy to come in,
TRYING to smoke out the mole

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:50.600
but that doesn’t work and as he reads Queenan’s diary

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.560
he finds out that Frank is an informant for the FBI.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.420
Something that Billy found out earlier and later
that night, on then news, it’s revealed

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:59.730
that Delahunt was an FBI informant.

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:04.460
and it’s sometime after that, the cops track
Frank to a coke drop off (with Billy’s help)

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:09.210
and a shootout ensues with Frank almost escaping
before getting gunned down by Collin after

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:12.260
Frank admits that he’s an FBI informant to Collin

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.060
So Collin’s a big hero for killing Frank Costello

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:16.800
Whoop-de-do! Big hero!

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.080
and when he get’s back, Billy’s waiting for him at his office

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.220
Wanting to have his identity given back to
him

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:24.620
But when he sees the envelopes that Frank gave to Collin

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:30.000
on Collin’s desk, he runs away,
realizing that Collin is Frank's rat

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:35.010
And realizing that Billy now knows this, Collin
deletes his police record.

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:39.360
Billy goes to Madolyn to give her an envelope
that she keeps hidden, before she reveals

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:44.460
to Collin that she’s pregnant (with Collin
unaware she had an affair with Billy);

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.440
Remember that invitation to some 'coffee' earlier?

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:47.520
It paid off.

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:52.600
it's later however that Collin catches her listening
to a CD from Billy that has a recording of

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.650
Collin’s conversations with Frank on it.

00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:00.760
So, Collin calls Billy who reveals that Frank
recorded all of their conversations and that

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:05.830
Frank’s lawyer was supposed to give
this whole collection of CDs to Billy.

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:10.940
Who will use it to get Collin arrested unless
he gives Billy his identity back, and they

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:13.420
agree to meet where Queenan died.

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:17.910
Where Billy handcuffs Collin, intending to
arrest him although Trooper Brown shows up,

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:19.340
drawing his gun.

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:23.860
As Billy explains that Collin was Frank’s
rat and asks Brown why he didn’t bring Dignam,

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:27.850
it's a question Brown doesn’t answer (or maybe he can't)

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:32.090
So Billy takes Collin down in the elevator
where as soon as it opens: Trooper Barrigan

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:36.830
shoots Billy dead and then he shoots
Trooper Brown when he comes down.

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:37.830
Guess what?

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:41.160
Trooper Barrigan is also another one of Frank’s moles.

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:45.760
But it don't end well for Barrigan because uh... Collin just shoots him.

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:49.920
Who frames Barrigan for Billy and Brown's murder

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:54.080
It’s after Billy’s funeral that Collin
returns home to find former Sergeant Dignam

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:57.920
waiting for him who avenges Captain Queenan and Billy

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:59.800
With a clean shot to the head.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:02.840
Good riddance.

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:07.360
So that ending was a little abrupt, kind of came out of nowhere, and was a very ambiguous

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.140
and you can interpret it in 1 of 2 ways

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:13.140
#1) You can interpret it as Dignam
being another one of Frank's moles

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:19.520
who was cleaning house and tying up loose ends in order to cover his own butt. Which makes sense

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:20.740
since Trooper Barrigan does say

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:23.540
"What you thought you were the
only mole in the police force?"

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:26.160
So there's some evidence to back up this interpretation

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:29.320
but there's a more simpler explanation and that is:

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:33.460
Former Sergeant Dignam avenging the deaths of Captain Queenan and of course!

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:38.060
Billy Castigan Jr., after he found
out that Collin was the mole

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:39.180
as to what I believe?

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:41.500
I subscribe to the second interpretation,

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:46.020
that sometime after Billy's death, he received that envelope from Madolyn

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:51.240
which has some evidence or has something that
reveals Collin's status as a mole

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:56.240
and after reading "this", he then takes matters
into his own hands and takes out Collin

00:07:56.240 --> 00:08:01.400
and that last shot with the rat on the windowsill, is a little
reference to the fact that wherever you go in this movie

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:04.620
There's always gonna be someone 
keeping secrets and telling lies

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:11.120
like police and criminals, and men and women. With
women like Madolyn and Gwen Costello (Frank's wife)

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:17.920
Now Madolyn is a liar, she outright tells a lie
to Collin that he is the father of her baby

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:21.660
When in fact, it's actually Billy and we
know this from 3 points of evidence. #1

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:24.660
it's been established that Collin has
some "trouble" performing in bed.

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:30.360
#2. There's a sex scene with Madolyn and 
Billy and sometime after that scene is

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:34.740
when she confirms that she's pregnant.
So there's a chronology to it

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:40.920
And thirdly, after receiving the conversations that Collin had with Frank. She says to Collin's face

00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:46.060
"And I thought I was the only liar."
Pretty irrefutable evidence, don't ya think?

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:53.220
which brings me to Gwen Costello, Frank's wife, that woman in the background whose always... "there"

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:58.860
Especially when Frank is having a very important conversation with someone on the phone.

00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:03.200
There's always these shots that linger on her in the background, where she's listening in,

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:09.800
doing her own thing. Now I'm not saying 100% that she's some sort of rat or mole or spy...

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:15.260
but it really raises a few eyebrows as to what she's hiding and who she's listening in for.

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:20.880
Maybe it's for another mob, an Irish mob, or an Italian mob, maybe even another branch of the federal police

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:25.180
Like the FBI, who knows. But that's
just my theory, what do you guys think?

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:31.260
Was Billy the father of Madolyn's child, and
was Gwen a 'mole' or was she hiding something?

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.140
Let me know with a comment down below

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:35.620
with that being said thank you so much for watching ladies and gentlemen
