00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:07.840
On a school trip,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.080
high school senior&nbsp;Peter Parker&nbsp;visits a&nbsp;Columbia&nbsp;
University&nbsp;genetics lab, where a genetically&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:43.840
engineered "super spider" who escaped containment&nbsp;
bites him, and he feels ill after returning home.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.640
Meanwhile,&nbsp;Norman Osborn, owner of scientific&nbsp;
corporation&nbsp;Oscorp, tries to land a major military&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:14.080
contract. He experiments on himself with an&nbsp;
unstable performance-enhancing chemical and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.080 --> 00:02:11.920
goes insane, killing his assistant and stealing&nbsp;
a glider with a flight suit. The next morning,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.120
Peter notices he is no longer&nbsp;myopic&nbsp;and his body&nbsp;
has metamorphosed into a more muscular physique.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.120
At school, he discovers that he can&nbsp;
shoot&nbsp;spiderwebs&nbsp;from his wrists&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:35.840
and has accelerated reflexes and an&nbsp;
increased ability to sense danger.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:45.120
After Peter beats&nbsp;Flash Thompson, the school&nbsp;
bully, in a fight, he realizes that he has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.840
acquired the abilities of the spider who bit&nbsp;
him, and verifies this by climbing up the wall.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:13.040
Having heard about his confrontation with&nbsp;
Flash, Peter's&nbsp;Uncle Ben&nbsp;counsels him that "with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:20.000
great power comes great responsibility". Peter&nbsp;
disregards this and enters a clandestine wrestling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.880
tournament to raise money to buy a car, wanting&nbsp;
to impress his love interest&nbsp;Mary Jane Watson.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.840
He wins his first match, but the&nbsp;
promoter cheats him out of his winnings.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.960
When a thief suddenly robs the promoter's office,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:59.840
Peter allows him to escape with the&nbsp;
promoter's money in retaliation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.840
Shortly after, he learns that Ben&nbsp;
has been killed by a carjacker.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:22.880
Peter pursues and confronts the carjacker, and&nbsp;
discovers he is the same thief he let escape.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.120
After Peter disarms him, the thief&nbsp;
falls out a window to his death.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:39.120
Meanwhile, a crazed Norman sports advanced Oscorp&nbsp;
armor and military equipment, and disrupts an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:44.320
experiment by Oscorp's corporate rival, Quest&nbsp;
Aerospace, killing several people in the process.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:54.880
The following day, he is shown to have no&nbsp;
memory of the event. Upon graduation, Peter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:02.693
begins to use his abilities to fight crime in the&nbsp;
city, becoming the masked superhero&nbsp;Spider-Man.

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:24.960
J. Jonah Jameson, editor of the&nbsp;Daily&nbsp;
Bugle&nbsp;newspaper, hires Peter as a freelance&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.120
photographer, as he is the only person&nbsp;
who provides clear images of Spider-Man.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:34.480
However, Jameson uses the pictures to&nbsp;
discredit Spider-Man, believing he is a menace.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:47.680
Meanwhile, Peter decides to move to an apartment&nbsp;
with his best friend and Norman's son&nbsp;Harry.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.840
Norman learns Oscorp's board plans to&nbsp;
oust him and sell the company to Quest,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:05.840
and exacts revenge on them as his costumed&nbsp;
alter-ego at the World Unity Fair.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:10.400
As Spider-Man, Peter intervenes&nbsp;
and defeats Norman, who escapes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:16.880
Jameson later dubs the mysterious villain&nbsp;
the "Green Goblin." After discovering he has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:22.480
developed a crazed&nbsp;alternate personality, Norman,&nbsp;
as the Goblin, offers Peter a place by his side,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:27.680
but he refuses. During their confrontation,&nbsp;
Peter suffers a cut to his left arm.

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:45.120
When Norman,&nbsp;Aunt May, and Mary Jane are invited&nbsp;
over for&nbsp;Thanksgiving&nbsp;dinner by Peter and Harry,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:49.760
Norman notices Peter's earlier sustained&nbsp;
injury, and deduces that Peter is Spider-Man.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:53.280 --> 00:07:01.840
He later attacks and hospitalizes May.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:13.520
Meanwhile, Mary Jane admits that she is in love&nbsp;
with Spider-Man, who has rescued her twice,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:16.160
and asks Peter if Spider-Man ever asked about her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:24.080
Harry, who is dating Mary Jane, arrives and&nbsp;
presumes that she has feelings for Peter after&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:31.520
seeing them hold hands. Devastated, Harry&nbsp;
tells his father that Peter loves Mary Jane,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:34.720
inadvertently revealing Spider-Man's&nbsp;
greatest weakness to him.

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:41.200
The Goblin kidnaps Mary Jane and a&nbsp;Roosevelt&nbsp;
Island trolley&nbsp;car full of children hostage&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:44.880
along the&nbsp;Queensboro Bridge, forcing&nbsp;
Peter to choose who he will save.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:54.720
He manages to rescue both, while civilians&nbsp;
nearby side with Peter and taunt the Goblin.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:59.520
Enraged, he grabs Peter and takes him&nbsp;
to the abandoned&nbsp;Smallpox Hospital,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:11.840
where he brutally beats him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:25.840
When the Goblin brags about how he will later kill&nbsp;
Mary Jane, an enraged Peter gains the upper hand.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:34.800
Norman reveals himself as the&nbsp;
Goblin and begs for forgiveness,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:39.840
while controlling his glider&nbsp;
to impale Peter from behind.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:46.640
Warned by his spider sense, Peter dodges the&nbsp;
attack and the glider fatally impales Norman,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:55.040
who asks Peter not to reveal his identity&nbsp;
as the Goblin to Harry before dying.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:02.320
Peter takes Norman's body to the Osborns'&nbsp;
house, where Harry sees him and mistakenly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:06.800
assumes Spider-Man killed his father, without&nbsp;
having time to see that Spider-Man is Peter.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:12.160
At Norman's funeral, Harry vows revenge on&nbsp;
Spider-Man, and claims that Peter is the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:17.920
only family he has left. Mary Jane confesses&nbsp;
her feelings for Peter, but he rejects her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:22.320
fearing that his enemies would try to get to&nbsp;
him through her. As he leaves the funeral,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:35.840
Peter remembers Ben's words and accepts&nbsp;
his new responsibility as Spider-Man.
