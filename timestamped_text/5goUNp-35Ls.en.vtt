00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.699
Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:06.430
Today, I'm going to explain a horror and sci-fi
film called "Annihilation."

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:07.870
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:09.920
Watch out and take care.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:16.059
Lena, a biologist, and an army veteran, mysteriously
survives a covert operation that left some

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:17.730
of her colleagues dead.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.290
Upon her return, she is brought to a government
facility and interrogated by a man wearing

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:24.460
a hazmat suit.

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.140
Lomax, the man questioning Lena, wonders how
she survived for two months when she only

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.500
had food rations for two weeks.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.729
Lena says she doesn't remember eating at all
during the mission.

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:40.329
She tries to recall more details of the expedition
as Lomax continues to probe for more answers.

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:44.359
Some years before the mission, a glowing asteroid
entered the Earth's atmosphere and landed

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:46.480
in a lighthouse on the southern coast of the
U.S.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.709
As soon as it hit the ground, it started emitting
a glowing smoke that expanded steadily.

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:56.069
Before the covert mission, Lena had been working
as a biology professor at the Johns Hopkins

00:00:56.069 --> 00:00:57.379
University.

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:01.879
During a class, she teaches her students how
a single cell continually splits and replicates

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:05.070
itself until it forms every living thing on
Earth.

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.960
After the class, a male colleague named Daniel
invites her to a party for the weekend.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.030
She turns him down with an excuse.

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.110
Daniel reminds her that it has been a year
since she lost her husband, Kane, and tells

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.799
her that it wouldn't be wrong for her to enjoy
some time with friends.

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:24.670
At home, Lena reminisces the pleasant times
she spent with Kane while she prepares to

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.380
paint the bedroom.

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.590
Kane, a Green Beret, had been missing since
he went away on a secret mission.

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.799
As Lena starts to paint, a man enters the
house and slowly makes his way up to the bedroom.

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:41.700
As he reaches the door, Lena sees him and
realizes that Kane has finally come home.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.409
She runs over to him and cries as she hugs
him.

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:48.909
Later on, Lena starts asking Kane about his
last mission, but he says he's unsure where

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:50.159
it was.

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.200
Lena continues to press him for answers, but
he keeps saying he doesn't know.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.380
When she asks how he got home, Kane just implied
that he found himself outside their room.

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.870
Before Lena could ask him any more questions,
he tells her that he's starting to feel sick.

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:08.869
Kane is loaded into an ambulance, but government
agents intercept them on the way to the hospital.

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.560
Lena struggles as the operatives drag her
away, so they sedate her while others take

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.700
Kane out of the ambulance.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.239
When Lena wakes up, she finds herself in a
government facility known as Area X.

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:25.030
A psychologist named Dr. Ventress enters her
room and asks her what she knows about Kane's

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.030
mission.

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.180
Ventress, who works for an organization called
the Southern Reach, informs her that Kane

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.110
is also at the facility, but he is severely
ill.

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.250
Lena surmises that the illness might be caused
by radiation or a virus and offers to help

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.230
Ventress find out what's wrong with her husband.

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.760
Ventress shows Lena the mysterious glowing
zone they call "The Shimmer" and explains

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.330
that none of the people who have ventured
into the area have returned.

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:52.269
So far, The Shimmer has only affected sparsely
populated swamplands, but the doctor fears

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:56.510
that it will keep expanding until it swallows
up whole cities and even states.

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.050
Kane is the only one who managed to get out
of The Shimmer, but he is slowly dying due

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.319
to multiple organ failures.

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:05.500
Ventress hints to Lena that she might not
be allowed to go home because of what she

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.980
knows about their covert operations.

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.530
Lena tells the psychologist that she wants
to stay with her husband.

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.051
Later that night, a team of scientists introduce
themselves to Lena and informs her that they're

00:03:16.051 --> 00:03:19.580
all scheduled to go into The Shimmer in a
few days with Ventress.

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:24.099
All previous expeditions had been military
personnel, but this time, the team will comprise

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:26.540
four female scientists.

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.489
Lena asks the women what they think happened
with the previous expeditions.

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:35.791
Anya Thorensen, a paramedic from Chicago,
suggests that the people who went inside the

00:03:35.791 --> 00:03:40.280
zone were probably killed by something, or
they went crazy and killed each other.

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:46.079
Cass Sheppard, a geomorphologist, mentions
that one military personnel was able to return

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:47.549
from the zone.

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:52.049
Lena falls silent and doesn't let them know
that the man who made it out was her husband.

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:55.890
The next day, Lena meets up with Ventress
and lets her know that she wants to join her

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:56.890
team.

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:00.159
She tells the doctor that she refrained from
telling the other members about her husband

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:02.549
because it might complicate things.

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:06.459
The five women soon enter into The Shimmer,
but they wake up to find themselves in a camp

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:09.549
without any recollection of what they did
after they went in.

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:13.180
They deduce from their remaining food supplies
that they've been inside for at least three

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:14.329
days.

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:20.300
Josie Radek, a physicist, notifies her teammates
that all their communications equipment cannot

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:22.410
send any signals out of The Shimmer.

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.770
However, other devices, such as the camera,
are working fine.

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:30.300
She checks the compass and finds out that
it is also malfunctioning.

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.310
They decide to head south until they reach
the coast, using only the sun and their watches

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.640
to point them in the right direction.

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:40.970
Along the way, they come across a hut covered
with various flowers that seem to be of different

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:41.970
species.

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:45.960
Lena, however, notices that they're all growing
from the same branch.

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:50.100
She concludes that all those flowers are from
the same plant, and it has constantly been

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:51.170
mutating.

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:55.080
All of a sudden, something grabs Radek and
tries to pull her underwater.

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.150
They pull Radek to safety and look around
for the creature that attacked her.

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:02.560
A giant alligator soon emerges from the water
and starts crawling toward them.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:07.470
As it gets close to Thorensen, Lena shoots
it continuously until it stops crawling.

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:12.400
When the reptile dies, Lena inspects its teeth
and discovers that it has mutated.

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.210
Lena tells Lomax that they saw other mutated
animals on their way to the coast back in

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:18.040
the interrogation room.

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:22.370
Lomax suggests that they could be hallucinations,
but Lena insisted that they all saw the same

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:24.660
things during the expedition.

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:28.730
With the boats they found near the hut, the
team makes their way out of the swamp.

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:32.680
Lena and Sheppard ride together and talk about
their past as they row.

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.860
Lena reveals that she served in the army for
seven years and met her husband there.

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:41.130
However, as Sheppard asks more questions,
Lena lies and tells her that her husband was

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:42.750
K.I.A.

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:46.080
Sheppard asserts that all of them decided
to go on the expedition because they're dealing

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.190
with some problem in their lives.

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:52.690
Anya is recovering from an addiction, while
Josie had probably tried to take her own life,

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:55.370
as indicated by the scars on her forearm.

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:58.980
No one seems to know much about Ventress,
but she doesn't appear to have any family

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:00.530
or friends.

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:04.350
Sheppard reveals that she has lost her daughter
to leukemia, and she's never been the same

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:05.520
since.

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:09.330
The group arrives in Fort Amaya, which served
as the headquarters of the Southern Reach

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:11.710
before it became part of The Shimmer.

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:16.650
Lena sees more mutated organisms on the walls,
noting that they appear to be malignant.

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:20.180
Inside the building, they notice that the
previous expedition has used the place as

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:21.350
a base.

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:25.780
As the team continues to investigate, they
find a memory card and insert it into Radek's

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:26.940
camera.

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:31.150
In the video, Kane cuts the stomach of his
teammate open to reveal a worm-like organism

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:32.860
moving around his stomach.

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:37.280
Thorensen concludes that members of the previous
expedition went crazy and killed each other,

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:40.490
but Radek thinks there was a creature inside
the man's stomach.

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:44.750
In another part of the building, they see
a corpse merged with a growing colony of fungi.

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:48.780
Radek says she doesn't want to stay at the
base any longer, but Ventress argues that

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:52.110
they have no choice because it's getting dark
outside.

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:56.900
That night, Lena recalls how her husband departed
abruptly for the covert operations, abandoning

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:00.020
their plans to spend time together in the
countryside.

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:03.990
Unable to fall asleep, she checks the cell
samples she gathered earlier and sees them

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:05.620
splitting rapidly.

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:09.470
She then goes to the outpost, where Ventress
is keeping watch so that she could replace

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:10.470
her.

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:14.400
After going over their plans for the next
day, Lena asks the psychologist why her husband

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.330
volunteered for the mission.

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:20.050
Ventress suggests that he must have joined
because of his self-destructive instinct,

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:23.000
which she believes is coded into the human
genes.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.680
The two women are suddenly startled by a loud
noise coming from the outside.

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:31.140
Sheppard, who was also awakened by the sound,
comes over to investigate.

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:35.070
While they look around the fort, a large animal
approaches Sheppard from behind and grabs

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:36.120
her.

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:39.970
With Sheppard gone, Radek and Thorensen insist
on heading back to the facility.

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:44.430
Ventress, however, is determined to continue
the journey to the lighthouse and find out

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:46.280
what's causing The Shimmer.

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:49.741
Lena hints that she also wants to go back,
but she argues that they can get out of The

00:07:49.741 --> 00:07:53.520
Shimmer by following the coast until they
reach the perimeter wall.

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:56.950
She points out that it had taken them six
days to get to the fort, but it will only

00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:59.610
take two more days to reach the coast.

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:04.000
In the interrogation room, Lomax accuses Lena
of lying to her teammates because she wanted

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.390
to continue the journey to the lighthouse.

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:09.960
He contends that Lena didn't know whether
it would be safe to move forward, but she

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:12.200
made the decision as if she did.

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:14.750
Lena argues that it was Ventress who made
the decision.

00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:19.620
Lomax, however, points out that Ventress is
sick with cancer and had no intention of coming

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:20.710
back.

00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:24.400
As they head to the coast, they find Sheppard's
shoe on the ground and decide to look for

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:25.440
her.

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:30.060
Lena goes deep into the woods and comes across
two deer that appear to be moving in unison.

00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:34.620
As she continues the search, she sees Sheppard's
mangled body under a tree.

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:38.919
The team decides to stay at an abandoned house
as the sky starts to set.

00:08:38.919 --> 00:08:42.399
Out in the yard, they find plants that are
shaped like humans beings.

00:08:42.399 --> 00:08:46.180
Radek starts conveying her theory that the
signals inside The Shimmer aren't blocked

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:47.620
but scrambled.

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:51.720
She suggests that The Shimmer is not just
refracting light and radio signals but DNA

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:53.100
as well.

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:57.050
That night Lena recalls her affair with Daniel
when her husband was away.

00:08:57.050 --> 00:09:00.490
Lena fears that her husband already knows
about their illicit relationship and tells

00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:03.170
Daniel that it won't ever happen again.

00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:07.519
As the team slept, Thorensen discovers the
picture of Kane in Lena's necklace and attacks

00:09:07.519 --> 00:09:08.519
her.

00:09:08.519 --> 00:09:12.800
Lena wakes up to find herself and her two
other teammates tied up to a chair.

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:16.260
Realizing that Lena had been lying to the
team, Thorensen starts to doubt whether an

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.300
animal killed Sheppard.

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:22.009
She recounts her theory that members of the
previous mission were either killed by something

00:09:22.009 --> 00:09:24.390
or went crazy and killed themselves.

00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:28.060
She noted that she had seen her fingerprints
moving earlier, suggesting that she might

00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:29.480
be going mad.

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:34.089
As she threatens to cut Lena with a knife,
they hear Sheppard's voice outside the house.

00:09:34.089 --> 00:09:38.029
Thorensen runs outside as she hears Sheppard
repeatedly yelling for help.

00:09:38.029 --> 00:09:41.130
The next thing the team hears is the roar
of a bear.

00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:44.790
The mutated bear finds its way into the room
and walks toward the women, who are still

00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:46.050
tied up.

00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:49.610
As the bear gets close, it starts imitating
Sheppard's voice.

00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:53.650
Wounded from the bear's attack, Thorensen
gets back in the house and tries to kill the

00:09:53.650 --> 00:09:55.740
bear, but the animal tears her apart.

00:09:55.740 --> 00:10:00.100
Radek breaks free from her chair and shoots
the bear dead while it attacks Lena.

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:03.681
Ventress fears that she wouldn't make it to
the lighthouse if they wait any longer, so

00:10:03.681 --> 00:10:06.180
she decides to go there independently.

00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:10.110
Lena finds Radek out in the yard and tells
her that she found mutations in her blood.

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:14.060
Radek concludes that the mutations will soon
be inside everyone.

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:17.680
She checks the roots and leaves that are starting
to grow in her arm and starts walking away

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:19.070
from Lena.

00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:23.670
Lena tries to run after her, but Radek disappears
when she reaches the garden with human-shaped

00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:24.670
plants.

00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:29.449
Now on her own, Lena finally reaches the coast
and sees numerous crystal trees growing outside

00:10:29.449 --> 00:10:30.910
the lighthouse.

00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:34.810
Inside the building, she sees a charred skeleton
sitting in front of a camera.

00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:38.740
When she played back the video, she sees Kane
sitting down, telling a person behind the

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:42.010
camera that he is starting to doubt his own
identity.

00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:46.790
Fearing that he might be losing his mind,
Kane prepares to detonate a phosphorous grenade.

00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:51.170
Kane tells the mysterious person to find Lena
then pulls the pin from the explosive.

00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:55.060
As he burns to death, a man behind the camera
walks toward Kane.

00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:59.560
When the man turns around, Lena sees that
he looks identical to her husband.

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:04.220
After turning off the camera, Lena starts
hearing voices coming from a hole in the ground.

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:08.029
She follows the voice and sees Ventress, who
appears to be mutating.

00:11:08.029 --> 00:11:11.959
The psychologist says that the mutation is
already inside her, and it will continue to

00:11:11.959 --> 00:11:14.699
expand until it swallows up everything.

00:11:14.699 --> 00:11:19.610
She warns that their bodies will be broken
up into small parts until they're all annihilated.

00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:23.730
Ventress then raises her head, and light bursts
out of her mouth until her body completely

00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:25.130
disintegrates.

00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:29.129
Lena stands by and watches as the light that
came out of Ventress transforms into different

00:11:29.129 --> 00:11:30.209
shapes.

00:11:30.209 --> 00:11:34.769
Moments later, the unknown life form absorbs
blood from a cut on Lena's face and starts

00:11:34.769 --> 00:11:37.110
morphing into a humanoid.

00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:41.279
Lena shoots the figure and tries to escape
from it, but she sees the entity, which starts

00:11:41.279 --> 00:11:44.160
to mimic her every move when she gets out
of the hole.

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:47.269
When she tries attacking it, the entity fights
back.

00:11:47.269 --> 00:11:51.009
She runs to the door, hoping to get out of
the lighthouse, but the creature holds on

00:11:51.009 --> 00:11:52.720
to her until she gives up.

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:56.829
With the entity still imitating her movements,
Lena finds another phosphorous grenade on

00:11:56.829 --> 00:11:58.130
the ground.

00:11:58.130 --> 00:12:01.829
After pulling out the pin, she hands it over
to the humanoid, which has started to copy

00:12:01.829 --> 00:12:03.339
her appearance.

00:12:03.339 --> 00:12:07.449
Lena leaves the lighthouse as the entity burns
and lights up other mutated organisms around

00:12:07.449 --> 00:12:08.449
it.

00:12:08.449 --> 00:12:12.970
The Shimmer starts to disappear when the humanoid
spreads the fire inside the hole.

00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:17.579
Back at the facility, Lomax asks Lena if she
found out what the entity wanted.

00:12:17.579 --> 00:12:22.399
Lena says that she doesn't know, but she asserts
that it is not trying to destroy anything.

00:12:22.399 --> 00:12:25.529
It was only mutating everything that it finds
to make something new.

00:12:25.529 --> 00:12:29.540
Lomax informs her that everything at the lighthouse
has been burned to cinders.

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:34.290
After The Shimmer disappeared, Kane's condition
stabilized and returned to normal.

00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:37.589
Lena pays a visit to her husband and asks
him whether he's Kane.

00:12:37.589 --> 00:12:41.629
He says, "I don't think so," and proceeds
to ask her if she's Lena.

00:12:41.629 --> 00:12:43.520
She hugs him and doesn't answer.

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:56.860
As they continue to embrace, both of their
eyes start to change colors and glow.
