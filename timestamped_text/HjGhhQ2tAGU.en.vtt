00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.960
Hello everyone, this is Mr. Junkie here! And&nbsp;
today we'll be talking about a fantasy action&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.680
filmed called Journey to the West; Conquering&nbsp;
the Demons! Be ready for some spoilers ahead!

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:15.120
A long time ago in a fishing village of&nbsp;
China, a little girl is playing on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.480
edges of a lake while her father&nbsp;
prepares to start the day's work.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.760
Seeing that the girl is upset&nbsp;
that her old man is leaving again,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.640
he goes into the water and begins playing&nbsp;
around, turning her tears into smiles again.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.320
Suddenly, the man begins convulsing&nbsp;
chaotically inside the lake,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.920
and eventually gets dragged around&nbsp;
through the water by something from below.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.080
The girl continues to laugh, not&nbsp;
realizing that her father is in danger,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.600
until the man disappears, leaving&nbsp;
only blood inside the water.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.320
The villagers quickly hire a demon hunter who&nbsp;
begins chanting and throwing bombs inside the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.960
lake, causing a large explosion inside&nbsp;
the water as everyone looks in amazement.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.480
They are able to capture a giant&nbsp;
stingray, and the hunter claims that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.200
this creature was possessed by a demon who's&nbsp;
responsible for killing the man from earlier.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.320
The people are extremely thankful&nbsp;
that the monster is caught,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.680
but a person inside the crowd tells them that&nbsp;
the fish is not a demon, only a common stingray.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.640
Apparently, the man's name is Tang, who's&nbsp;
also a demon hunter and a monk's apprentice.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.200
The other demon hunter hears this and quickly&nbsp;
accuses Tang as being an accomplice with the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.960
demon, causing the villagers to attack the man&nbsp;
furiously, eventually tying him up as punishment.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.480
Everyone begins jumping into the&nbsp;
water, believing that it's safe,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.800
while Tang watches hopelessly at the people.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.040
Their celebration is quickly ended when&nbsp;
a woman gets devoured by a giant beast,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.960
as everyone looks in disbelief.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.360
The people begin rushing back to shore, believing&nbsp;
that they are safe as long as they're out of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.080
water, but they are quickly proven wrong as the&nbsp;
monster grabs the villagers using it's tongue.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.800
The little girl from before&nbsp;
tries to run towards her mother,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.520
but the creature takes the chance and grabs on&nbsp;
to the child, trying to drag her into the water.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.520
The villagers run to help the little girl and&nbsp;
cut off the monster's tongue while catching&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.160
her on the edge of the bridge, but the creature&nbsp;
jumps up and takes the girl inside its mouth.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:05.120
The mother becomes furious and jumps down into&nbsp;
the lake, trying desperately to save her daughter,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.560
while Tang begins using his teeth&nbsp;
to free himself from the ropes.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.720
She is paralyzed with fear when she sees&nbsp;
the giant monster appearing from the water,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.280
trembling with anger as it stares at the woman.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.720
She begs the creature to return her child, but&nbsp;
the demon only responds by devouring her as well.

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.920
The monster breaks the buildings&nbsp;
nearby, causing all the people to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.840
loose their balance while a baby slides&nbsp;
towards the lake away from his mother.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.600
Luckily, Tang is able to break free&nbsp;
and jumps down near the platform,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.000
making the baby slide towards him instead.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.200
He grabs the infant as the giant&nbsp;
creature launches towards him,

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.120
but Tang manages to escape in time&nbsp;
and traps the monster on the platform,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.760
using the creature's weight&nbsp;
to jump towards the people.

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.760
Tang gives the child back to his mother,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.280
but only sees that the fake demon&nbsp;
hunter is hiding like a coward.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.000
an enormous girl runs out from the crowds,&nbsp;
causing earthquakes with every step she takes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.920
and jumps down towards the monster.

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.240
The massive woman lands on the platform&nbsp;
and sends the creature flying into the air,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.840
landing right on top of the fake&nbsp;
demon hunter before he can escape.

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.480
The creature begins transforming back slowly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.760
eventually turning into a young&nbsp;
man who appears to be harmless.

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.480
The villagers sees this and&nbsp;
tries to kill the demon,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.360
but Tang stops the violence&nbsp;
and offers a better way.

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.240
The man takes out a bunch of instruments and&nbsp;
then a book that's called the 300 nursery rhymes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:25.120
preparing to unleash his musical talents in&nbsp;
order to change the monster from evil to good.

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:30.000
Tang begins singing horrifically, which confuses&nbsp;
the demon and the audience at the same time.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.400
The man's lyrics and performance were soo&nbsp;
bad that it drives the creature into madness,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.880
as the demon begins beating on the man&nbsp;
furiously and smashing everything around.

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.280
Before Tang is killed, a woman grabs the&nbsp;
demon and begins beating on the creature,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.760
eventually sealing the monster into a&nbsp;
magical cloth, and turning it into a doll.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.240
It turns out the woman's name is Duan, and&nbsp;
she's one of the demon hunters as well,

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:55.600
but when Tang shows her the tools&nbsp;
that he use to conquer the monsters,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:00.560
the woman laughs at him hysterically while all the&nbsp;
villagers thank her for being their true savior.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.440
Tang is upset at the failure, but his master tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.480
him that it's never easy to&nbsp;
change evil into goodness.

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.600
He tells the monk that there's a&nbsp;
second demon that he must conqueror,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.840
who lives in a nearby restaurant and&nbsp;
uses human flesh as cooking materials.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.760
At night, Tang arrives at the demon's&nbsp;
restaurant and enters the building,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.960
only to see that it's full of&nbsp;
people who are enjoying their meals.

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:24.000
He's greeted by a woman who&nbsp;
begins to show him around,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.960
but Tang is able to see through the illusions&nbsp;
right away and tells her to show her true form.

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.440
The demon charges at Tang as he runs in&nbsp;
fear, but he's saved when Duan shows up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.440
and punches the woman repeatedly,&nbsp;
eventually turning her into dust.

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.000
She begins attacking everyone in the restaurant,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.040
breaking the demons apart&nbsp;
one by one using her rings.

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:47.040
the woman shouts for the boss to come&nbsp;
out, as a young man sneaks behind her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:52.080
but Duan counters immediately and begins fighting&nbsp;
the demon as they exchange furious attacks.

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.080
The woman is able to gain the advantage&nbsp;
and punches the man across the room.

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:00.640
She then summons numerous rings, and begins&nbsp;
firing them at the demon, aiming purposely at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:05.040
the man's face, eventually breaking he's&nbsp;
skin and revealing the snout of a pig.

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.080
The demon begins blocking all&nbsp;
her attacks using the rake,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.240
and closing the distance towards the woman.

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.080
He swings at Duan furiously,&nbsp;
forcing the woman to defend herself,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.160
but is able to strike into her flesh&nbsp;
whiles she escapes right before impact.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.960
Duan jumps behind the creature&nbsp;
and begins kicking him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.360
forcing the monster to reveal it's true&nbsp;
form, which turns out to be a demon pig.

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:30.240
She locks the creatures arms and prevents him from&nbsp;
moving, while shouting for Tang to come and help.

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.200
Duan has locked the demon's&nbsp;
essence inside his throat,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.520
and requires Tang to suck it out from the pig.

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.800
The man tries to conjure up enough&nbsp;
courage to complete the task,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.040
but finds it extremely difficult after&nbsp;
looking at the monster's hideous face.

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:46.960
Luckily, Tang falls by accident in&nbsp;
this madness and kisses the pig,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.960
sucking the demon inside his mouth.

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:53.280
Duan quickly takes the essence from the&nbsp;
man and puts inside her bag of sealing.

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:57.760
However the demon is too powerful to&nbsp;
be contain and begins to grow larger,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:00.800
eventually breaking free and&nbsp;
showing it's monstrous form.

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.240
The two quickly runs away as the&nbsp;
entire building crashes down.

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:07.600
They are able to escape the demon&nbsp;
as they arrive beside a lake.

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.920
Duan falls down from the pain of her injuries,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:13.760
and proceeds to demonstrate her female&nbsp;
assets right in front of the main character.

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.160
The lucky man gets even luckier when she tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.720
him to put pressure on her&nbsp;
wounds and stop the bleeding,

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.840
which Tang was able to do at&nbsp;
the cost of bleeding himself,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.160
but it doesn't seem like he minds very much.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:29.440
When Duan closes her eyes and leans in for a&nbsp;
kiss, the man suddenly realizes that he's a monk,

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.680
and runs away from the woman immediately,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:35.200
most likely not wanting to pay for&nbsp;
any child supports in the future.

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:40.240
The next day, Tang goes back to his master,&nbsp;
telling the old man that he failed once again.

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:43.920
The master tells the young man that&nbsp;
in order to conquer the pig monster,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:46.640
he must go to an the king of all demons for help.

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:50.640
Apparently this powerful entity is&nbsp;
known as WuKong, who was locked up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:55.440
500 years ago under a great mountain by&nbsp;
the Gods for causing havoc in the heavens.

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:58.080
At night while traveling inside the forest,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:02.960
Tang runs into a trap set by a group of&nbsp;
people who appears to be extremely hostile,

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:05.440
but it turns out that they all work for Duan,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.640
and she plans to force the monk&nbsp;
to marry her no matter what.

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:11.840
However, Tang refuses, claiming that he can't love&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:16.560
her as the monk's code dictates that he&nbsp;
must love everyone in this world equally.

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:21.600
In a fit of rage, Duan locks the man inside&nbsp;
while thinking about what to do with him next.

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:26.240
Her sister tries to convince her to be more&nbsp;
feminine and use her dancing to attract the man,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:28.400
but after seeing her horrible moves,

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:33.360
the woman puts a talisman on Duan and plans to&nbsp;
control her movements while seducing the monk.

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:38.480
Duan goes to her crush, but things quickly&nbsp;
go wrong as the charm begins to malfunction,

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:41.120
causing the woman to strike&nbsp;
the main character repeatedly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:44.000
until the charm accidentally flies onto the man.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.800
Duan runs out of the room in guilt, but at&nbsp;
the same time, the sister begins dancing,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:53.200
causing Tang to shake his body exactly like&nbsp;
her in front of the guards who rushed in.

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:57.200
The men sees the monk's ridiculous moves&nbsp;
and proceeds to beat him up once again,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:01.440
only stopping when the sister runs&nbsp;
inside after realizing something's wrong.

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:04.880
Their fun is cut short when they&nbsp;
see that the pig demon has arrived,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:09.120
and the group quickly goes on their vehicle&nbsp;
and tries to run desperately for their lives.

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:14.720
However, the pig is able to catch up and charges&nbsp;
directly at the group. Duan sees this and pushes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:19.600
the monk off the car, before the demon crashes&nbsp;
into the group breaking everything apart.

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:23.680
Luckily, no one got hurt in the crash, but&nbsp;
they are quickly cornered by the demon,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:27.520
as it plans to take vengeance on their&nbsp;
guild leader for their previous battle.

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:32.880
Suddenly, a man with a tiger's aura charges&nbsp;
towards the monster and begins to overpower it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:37.840
tossing the creature in the air and landing&nbsp;
a devastating kick, forcing the demon to run.

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:42.480
It turns out that the man is also a demon&nbsp;
hunter, and he's accompanied by the mighty foot,

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:45.120
along side prince important and his four beautiful&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:47.200
nannies who he commands to throw&nbsp;
flower peddles at all times.

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:50.480
However, his servant seem to&nbsp;
be terrible at following orders&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:54.080
and embarrasses him continuously&nbsp;
by calling him prince important.

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:58.640
The three begins arguing for who gets to take&nbsp;
down the pig demon which greatly angers Tang,

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:03.920
claiming that they are only doing this for money&nbsp;
and vanity, not worth of being true demon hunters.

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:07.200
Tang tells Duan to give him back&nbsp;
the nursery rhymes that she took,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:09.760
and begins yelling at her for wasting his time.

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:11.440
This causes the woman to become&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:15.120
furious as she rips the book into&nbsp;
pieces and throwing it in the air.

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:18.960
She begins hitting Tang with anger and&nbsp;
tells him that he's nothing without her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:21.200
and would of died a long time ago.

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:25.280
Tang gets up in silence and sees that Duan&nbsp;
is trying to flirt with the prince in order&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:29.920
to make him jealous, but begins walking&nbsp;
away as the girl looks at him in sadness.

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:34.000
After traveling for a long time through&nbsp;
the lands, Tang eventually arrives on a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.600
mountain where its covered in lily&nbsp;
pads despite the absence of water.

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:42.080
He sees a large Lily flower grown through what&nbsp;
appears to be a hole inside, and proceeds to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:46.400
jump in, only to find a crazy looking&nbsp;
man who hugs and kisses him repeatedly.

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:51.520
Tang realizes that this must be Wukong and tries&nbsp;
to ask him for help in defeating the pig demon,

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:55.360
but the man is only interested in leaving&nbsp;
this place, and tries desperately to trick&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:55.360 --> 00:10:00.000
the monk into removing the seal, claiming&nbsp;
that its capable of capturing the monster.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.440
However, Tang does not fall for the petty tricks,&nbsp;
causing Wukong to try to escape in frustration,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:10.000
but the roots in the cave traps the demon&nbsp;
inside and begins wiping him for disobedience.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.280
Tang begins to feel sorry for&nbsp;
the man, and offers him a banana,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:17.920
which softens the demon's demeanors as he begins&nbsp;
telling the monk how to defeat the pig monster.

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:20.880
Because the demon used to&nbsp;
love his wife tremendously,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:23.920
they need to get a beautiful woman&nbsp;
to dance under the moonlight,

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:28.720
which will attract the monster towards the&nbsp;
cave, allowing Wukong to trap it inside as well.

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:32.160
Suddenly, Duan jumps into the cave&nbsp;
after hearing about their plan,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:34.560
and offers to be the bait for the pig demon.

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:36.800
Tang sees the woman and tells her to get out,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:40.080
but Wukong begins flirting with&nbsp;
her as he teaches her to dance.

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:42.960
It's quite evident that the&nbsp;
monk truly does love the woman,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:46.640
as he feels great discomfort at the&nbsp;
sight of the affectionate display.

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:51.120
At night, Duan begins dancing under the&nbsp;
moonlight as the monk plays the music for her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:55.600
The man watches the woman as he falls deeper&nbsp;
in love with every move that she makes.

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:59.760
Soon, they hear a monstrous roar and&nbsp;
sees that the pig demon has arrived.

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:03.840
Wukong begins talking with creature from&nbsp;
inside the cave, causing the monster to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:08.240
peek under the lilies, only to be sucked&nbsp;
in completely by the sealing of the gods.

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:11.520
Duan turns the pig demon into a&nbsp;
doll, and gives both monster to Tang,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:14.720
allowing him to use his nursery&nbsp;
rhymes to convert the evil creatures.

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:20.400
She puts a ring on the monk and wants&nbsp;
to marry him, but Tang become extremely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:24.480
upset and would rather cut off his own&nbsp;
finger than be in a relationship with her.

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:28.000
Duan sees this and takes off the&nbsp;
ring herself, trying to give back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.560
the nursery rhyme that she glued back together,&nbsp;
but the monk refuses the book in anger.

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:35.600
The woman sees the man's&nbsp;
conviction and leaves in tears,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:38.400
promising to not follow him anymore in the future.

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:41.760
Tang walks out from the cave and&nbsp;
looks towards the moon in sadness,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:44.160
suffering from the pain of his true feelings.

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:48.960
He hears Wukong asking for a favor to remove&nbsp;
the lily flower which block the entrance,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:51.360
as he wants to enjoy the moonlight as well.

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:52.880
The monk cut off the flower,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:57.280
but immediately notices something wrong&nbsp;
as all the lilies are consumed in flames.

00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:59.680
Wukong laughs Maniacally inside the cave,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:04.160
before finally breaking free in a ball of&nbsp;
fire that lands directly in front of the monk.

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:08.160
He grabs the man and tosses him away&nbsp;
like a ragdoll, before catching him again&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:12.800
under the mountain, mocking the man for being&nbsp;
so easily tricked to unleash the demon king.

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:15.360
Tang tells the monkey demon&nbsp;
that he hasn't escaped,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:18.400
as the Buddha is watching&nbsp;
everything even at this moment.

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:22.320
In a fit of rage, Wukong begins&nbsp;
ripping off the monk's hair violently,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:27.280
eventually leaving nothing left, but is&nbsp;
furious that the man's will is still intact.

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:32.320
Suddenly, the demon feels a presence behind and&nbsp;
sees that the three demon hunters have arrived.

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:35.360
The fist of north star prepares&nbsp;
to attack the demon king,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:39.920
but Wukong launches forward and quickly kills&nbsp;
the man as he bites down on the hunter's throat.

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:43.760
The Mighty foot sees this and begins&nbsp;
transforming, growing a giant leg the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:48.800
size of a school bus and kicks the monkey demon&nbsp;
with immense force, knocking him backwards.

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:52.960
The old man jumps in the air and stomps at&nbsp;
Wukong, but the monkey king pierces right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:57.440
through the feet and kicks the old man into the&nbsp;
air, sending him right on top of the prince.

00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:02.240
He tells the nannies to throw away the old man,&nbsp;
and begins throwing numerous swords at the demon,

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:04.720
forcing Wukong to escape into the air as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:07.920
the weapons continues to follow&nbsp;
and attack where ever he goes.

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:11.840
The demon takes out his weapon as well,&nbsp;
and begins knocking the swords away,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:16.240
but the prince combines all the weapons into&nbsp;
one and send it flying towards the monkey.

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:20.160
The attack was so powerful that it&nbsp;
begins breaking apart the demon's staff,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:24.960
but eventually hits a wall when it makes contact&nbsp;
with the monkey and gets shattered into pieces.

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:27.440
Wukong Roars at the attackers furiously,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:30.640
creating a shockwave that turns&nbsp;
the demon hunters into dust.

00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:33.760
He turns the attention towards&nbsp;
the monk, but surprisingly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:37.760
Duan jumps out and begins defending&nbsp;
the man even after what he said to her.

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:40.640
The woman begins attacking Wukong with her rings,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:44.160
but the weapons all shatter as into&nbsp;
pieces after hitting the demon king.

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:45.680
She charges towards the monkey,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:49.920
but Wukong easily stops her by striking&nbsp;
her head and sends her flying backwards.

00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:54.560
Tang crawls towards the woman, and Duan&nbsp;
whispers to him, asking if he ever loved her.

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:58.720
The monk begins crying helplessly and&nbsp;
tells Duan that he always lover her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:00.640
ever since the first time they met.

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:04.400
Hearing the man's confession, Duan&nbsp;
finally dies with tears in her eyes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:08.640
while Tang hold her and kisses her, taking&nbsp;
her ring and putting it on his finger.

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:10.400
Before the man can finish mourning,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:15.200
Wukong takes the girl's body and throws it in&nbsp;
the air, blasting it into a million pieces.

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:18.720
Suddenly the demon feels something&nbsp;
wrong and retreats immediately,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:22.560
only to see that Tang has finally&nbsp;
let go of all mortal attachments.

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:27.120
The monk begins reading the book that Duan put&nbsp;
together, and chanting to the words inside,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:30.320
creating a massive Buddha that&nbsp;
overlooks the entire planet.

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:33.520
The giant statue begins pushing&nbsp;
its palm towards the planet,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:38.320
creating a massive shockwave as it enters&nbsp;
the atmosphere and lighting its hand on fire.

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:42.960
Wukong sees this and refuses to give up,&nbsp;
gathering all his energy onto his body,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:47.920
and quickly transforming into King Kong, towering&nbsp;
over everything while screaming furiously.

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:52.480
The giant palm approaches closer and closer&nbsp;
towards the demon, and Wukong tries to lift the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:57.440
Buddah at the last moment, managing to stop the&nbsp;
attack as he struggles under the immense weight.

00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:00.480
However, the demon is no&nbsp;
match for the god's power,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:02.800
and gets crushed underneath the massive hand.

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:07.200
Wukong is brought into a different dimension,&nbsp;
where Tang has finally conquered the demon.

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:10.880
He proceeds to takes off Duan's ring&nbsp;
and binds it onto the monkey' head,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:12.880
making the demon his new disciple.

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:16.720
The monk's master tells the man that he's&nbsp;
now ready for the journey to the west.

00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:20.640
He'll obtain the holy scriptures from&nbsp;
India, accompanied by the demons who are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:24.160
now his students, so that they may&nbsp;
lessen the sufferings of humanity.
