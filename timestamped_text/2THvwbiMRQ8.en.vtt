00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.750
Welcome to Game Of Thrones season 2 – Crammed!
Thanks for all the comments on season 1, I

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:13.610
hope you’ve given it a watch because we’re
gonna dive right in!

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:16.820
We begin with the hound beating the shit out
of somebody for the entertainment of king

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.920
Joffrey on his nameday, but up next is a drunk
knight called Ser Dontos who Joff is gonna

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.900
have murdered gluttony style for turning up
late. However Sansa pleads for his life and

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.710
Sandor subtly backs her play.
Tyrion is in town back from the war and pleased

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.820
to see his family - and Joffrey, and it looks
like he’s gonna instil some order. Sansa

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.039
plays the perfect hostage and Tyrion meets
with Cersei and the small council to act as

00:00:37.039 --> 00:00:40.070
hand.
Cersei isn’t happy to see him which is great,

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.469
and Tyrion gives her stick for loosing Ned
and Arya thanks to poor management. And the

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:48.920
fact she has no control over this creep.
T-Dog is settling in Ned’s old tower of

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.499
the hand with his secret whore Shae while
Littlefinger and Cersei rub each other the

00:00:52.499 --> 00:00:55.530
wrong way.
Up at Winterfell the old lords test Bran to

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.300
see how easily he’ll roll over, but with
Maester Luwin’s advice he’s doing ok looking

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.910
after the place with Robb in the field. He
starts to have dreams where he is in the body

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.700
of his Direwolf Summer, and spies a red comet
in the sky. Osha their wildling housepet says

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.500
the comet means different things to different
people, but claims it’s truth is the coming

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.840
of dragons.
Speaking of which Dany and her ragtag leftover

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.170
khalasar are marching through the red wastes.
They’re sore and tired with the horses dying

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.420
of starvation - but they must cross because
all other directions hold danger and those

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.229
that would kill them and steal the hatchling
dragons.

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:29.860
She sends her bloodriders off to scout the
land in all directions for signs of hope,

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.259
and follows the route of comet herself. Her
story is gonna be pretty thin this season.

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.810
North of the wall the Night’s Watch stop
at Craster’s keep, Craster being a wildling

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.680
who is friendly-ish to the Watch and has a
habit of marrying his own daughters to gain

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.630
more daughters. Jon and Sam wonder what happens
to his sons but in the hall Mormont is seeking

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.070
information as to why all the wildling villages
have been abandoned.

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.759
Turns out they have all gone north to join
the King-Beyond the Wall, Mance Rayder, an

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.330
ex-brother of the Watch, who is gathering
a huge army.

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.409
And despite being hidden far away over at
Dragonstone during season one, we finally

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:04.990
see what Stannis, dead king Robert’s older
and less fun brother is up to. Turns out he’s

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.899
spending all of his time in the company of
the Red woman Melisandre, a priestess of the

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.670
Lord of light who has a massive boner for
burning things and religiously converting

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.390
everyone in a bid to help Stannis claim the
throne.

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.180
This new religion is upsetting a lot of the
oldschoolers however, so whilst we get a flavour

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.569
for how just and stubborn and humourless Stannis
is, their Maester tries a suicide poision

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:27.110
wine attack on Melisandre, but her magic appears
to be too strong.

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.100
Don’t forget the North is at war with the
South, So King Robb checks in on his captive

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.050
Jamie Lannister to give him some wolf heebie-jeebies,
and tells him that Stannis is sending ravens

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.819
to everyone saying he’s the next king in
line because Joffrey and co. are just incest

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:42.630
babies between Jaime and the Queen.
Robb sends terms to the Lannisters about staying

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.811
out of the North forever and Theon who’s
the son of Balon Greyjoy of the Iron Islands

00:02:46.811 --> 00:02:51.080
suggests he go back home to convince the Krakens
to lend their ships to Robb’s war. Catelyn

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.140
thinks that letting Theon go is a terrible
idea, but her job is to go South and meet

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.040
with Renly, dead King Robert’s other brother
who tried to warn Ned back in the day and

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.129
see if he wants an alliance with the Starks,
because like Stannis, he’s also claiming

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:07.390
the throne for himself as king, despite being
the younger (but more popular) brother.

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.879
And to wrap things up for the Day Joffrey
has the gold cloaks go around killing all

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:15.640
of king Robert’s bastard children, including
babies! So that nobody can compare their Baratheon

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.660
bloodline features to that of the golden children.
Good thing Gendry has been sent off with Arya

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.030
then amongst the recruits for the Night’s
Watch!

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.830
In fact whilst Arya is pretending to be a
boy and annoying the worst of the criminals

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:30.260
form the dark dungeons, including this mysterious
polite person, Goldcloaks rush up to claim

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.840
back Gendry, although Arry assumes it’s
for her, but Yoren ain’t taking no shit

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.349
as this ragtag group now belongs to the Watch.
Most of who by the way are still loitering

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:42.650
at Craster’s Keep. With the rumours of Craster
sacrificing his sons, Jon follows the man

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.650
during the dead of night and glimpses what
looks to be one of the Others taking the baby

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:51.150
as sacrifice – Oop! Watch out! Ah too late.
Craster is pissed off at Jon for snooping

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:56.239
around and despite the fact that he’s sacrificing
babies, Mormont decides is just time to move

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:00.280
on (finally). And although Sam wants to take
Gilly, one of his pregnant daughters with

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.670
them, they’re marching North, the wrong
way.

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:06.739
Back down in King’s Landing Varys visits
Shae and Tyrion to basically drive the point

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:10.640
home that there are no secrets kept from him,
and explains that it’s important to have

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.140
friends that can be trusted.
While in the city’s weird brothels where

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:19.630
- ugh gross! Oh no mate! - some of the whores
are feeling sad that a baby was killed here

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:23.840
the other day. But Littlefinger makes it clear
he doesn’t care for sad girls that can’t

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.510
make him money.
On the topic however Tyrion invites Janos

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.530
Slynt up to dinner, the leader of the Goldcloaks
who turned on Ned Stark’s men in the throne

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.030
room last season and further went round killing
all the bastard children earlier. You see

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.860
Tyrion doesn’t like scumbags, so Slynt is
gonna be joining the Night’s Watch whether

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.000
he wants to or not. And now Bronn is charge
of the Goldcloaks! Not that he’s a particularly

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.740
good person either, just on Tyrion’s payroll.
Oh and despite being terrible Cersei actually

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.630
thinks she’s the only one round here keeping
things together! And she further tells Tyrion

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:55.120
that he murdered their mother, who died whilst
giving birth to him, which is just really

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.151
harsh.
Theon Greyjoy sails home for the Iron islands

00:04:58.151 --> 00:05:02.470
to help Robb win his father over to the war,
and he’s all excited about being an important

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:07.000
Prince returned home. He talks bit about their
culture of raping and pillage and salt wives

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.710
and - Oh bloody hell mate.
But once he’s there nobody seems to care

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:14.330
that much and no one is out to greet him.
Until this cheeky girl offers to escort him

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:18.590
up to the castle on her horse like some kind
of Uber. Theon spends the ride trying to get

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:22.280
friendly and going on about how awesome he
is like a real mouthy prick, but once he gets

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:26.250
to the Castle his Father thinks Theon has
grown to be a soft boy of Winterfell and the

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:30.600
Starks. He’s forgotten that these hard bastards
don’t buy pretty clothes, but claim stuff

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.460
for their own. In fact Balons planning on
claiming a crown for his own too (seeing as

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:37.160
everyone else is doing it) by attacking the
North.

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:40.770
Basically Theon grew up with the Starks as
a ward because the Iron Islands rose up in

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:45.509
rebellion a while back which was crushed accordingly.
So Balon isn’t too happy about that, oh

00:05:45.509 --> 00:05:49.520
yeah and that cheeky bird is actually Theon’s
sister Yara, who is more of a Kraken than

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.840
he is – awkward!
Down on Dragonstone The faithful Onion Knight

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:57.419
Ser Davos convinces an old pirate captain
friend of his Salladhor Saan to lend his fleet

00:05:57.419 --> 00:06:01.250
to King Stannis’ cause in return for the
plunder of King’s Landing when he takes

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:05.310
the throne. Davos Seaworth used to be smuggler
in the day but he’s basically just a real

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:09.650
honest and simple loyal guy now in support
of his King. But he’s not taken on the new

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:12.509
red faith of Melisandre quite like the others
have.

00:06:12.509 --> 00:06:15.790
Stannis likes the fleet, but he doesn’t
have enough strength to beat his younger brother

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:20.120
Renly in the field. Melisandre suggest that
he give himself to her directly so that she

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:24.699
can bear him some kind of son (Despite him
having a wife). So of course they have sex,

00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:27.220
because if you’re not killing somebody in
this show, you’re banging them.

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:30.949
Bran’s wolf dreams become stronger, often
running in the woods in the body of Summer.

00:06:30.949 --> 00:06:34.819
Maester Luwin is more a science guy however
and doesn’t believe in such forces, although

00:06:34.819 --> 00:06:39.040
he does admit that long ago there were such
things as dragons and magic and the children

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:41.830
of the forest.
Catelyn travels down to meet Renly and his

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:45.919
host, who are taking things easy and having
a melee. Looks like Loras is beaten by a woman

00:06:45.919 --> 00:06:50.800
called Brienne of Tarth, who joins Renly’s
Kingsguard as her prize. Meanwhile Renly promises

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:54.699
to bring Joffrey’s head to Cat when he takes
King’s landing, despite a little bit of

00:06:54.699 --> 00:06:58.629
my King versus your King friction.
Renly is well loved but not as much as he

00:06:58.629 --> 00:07:02.550
loves Loras, despite being married to his
sister, Queen Margery. She doesn’t really

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:06.380
mind but if they don’t get down and have
a baby soon there’s gonna be a problem.

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:10.400
Over on Pyke Balon Greyjoy plots to pillage
the North with his ships while Robb heads

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:14.669
South. Theon gets a hard time from his dad
and sister for being a weak Starkling at heart

00:07:14.669 --> 00:07:18.210
and is eager to prove himself.
Now he does almost send a letter to Robb as

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:22.840
warning but decides to follow the dark side
and be a Kraken instead. So he joins the faith

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:27.870
of their drowned God – and nobody’s impressed.
In order to keep her secret Tyrion has to

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:32.131
set Shae up as being a scullery maid, which
she doesn’t like at all, and over a Royal

00:07:32.131 --> 00:07:37.110
dinner Sansa tries not to cry her eyes out
at the prospect of having to marry Joffrey.

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:41.060
Well Shae is her new handmaid now, and I’m
sure that’s all gonna be fine.

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:45.400
Tyrion tells grand Maester Pycelle of a secret
plan about marrying off Princess Marcella,

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:49.550
and he also tells this to Varys and Littlefinger,
but each time a different version, all as

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:54.090
a cunning trick to discovering who’s informing
on him to the queen. Spoiler alert its Pycelle.

00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:57.810
Cersei and Littlefinger are pissed off at
being tricked, whilst Varys congratulates

00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:02.139
the power play before Tyrion pops in on Pycelle
and has his beard cut off before throwing

00:08:02.139 --> 00:08:05.370
him in a black cell.
On their way North Yoren Tells Arya about

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:09.550
holding grudges and dealing with trauma, just
before the Goldcloacks return to attack the

00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:14.130
group with the help of Tywin’s man, ser
Armory Lorch. Yoren is a badass who despite

00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:18.460
a crossbow bolt takes down a handful of men,
but he was only one against many and now it’s

00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:22.900
time to fight and run. Fire spreads in the
confusion, and Arya gives an axe to the guys

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:26.690
from the black cells to escape with. However
the kids are captured and Needle is stolen

00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:31.650
by this asshole who casually kills another
boy. But Arya smartly claims he was Gendry,

00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:34.890
the boy they were after anyway, basically
saving this guy’s life.

00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:39.320
The Stark armies are still smashing the Lannisters,
and after another win he takes a shine to

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:43.760
this Volantis girl while she saws off a guy’s
leg. Romantic. She plays hard to get and Robb

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:47.210
likes it.
Oh God back to Joffrey again, because his

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:51.730
armies are losing he has Sansa punished and
beaten by his Kingsguard at court. But before

00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:55.520
she’s fully stripped Tyrion steps up and
remind Joff what happened to the last Mad

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:59.440
King when he kept doing whatever cruel things
he wanted. Ser Meryn doesn’t like people

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:03.840
talking back to the King, but Bronn is here
and Bronn can kill him. And Tyrion is impressed

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:07.460
at Sansa’s resolve at playing the good hostage
despite everything.

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:10.880
So he gets Joffrey some whores for his birthday
in the hope that getting laid might chill

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:14.990
him out a bit, but instead he has one beat
the other horribly at crossbow point, because

00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:18.950
he’s just that kind of king.
Cersei’s cousin Lancel tries giving Tyrion

00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:23.630
a hard time on her behalf for imprisoning
Pycelle. But he’s a dumb idiot and Tyrion

00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:28.040
gets him to admit that Cerseis been banging
him too. So now worried for his life Tyrion

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:31.940
gets Lancel to continue keeping her happy
between the sheets as long as he informs on

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:34.710
her for him.
Littlefinger visits King Renly as he marches

00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:38.910
to meet his brother Stannis in a manner that
hints at scheming but leads nowhere, because

00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:42.570
he really wants to meet with Catelyn, who’s
really unhappy to see him since the whole

00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:46.840
betraying her husband thing. He lies and says
that both her daughters are captive at King’s

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:50.860
Landing and suggests that she swap them out
for Jamie Lannister, then he returns Ned’s

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:54.230
bones courtesy of Tyrion.
In reality Arya and the other captive boys

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:58.330
are taken to Harrenhall as prisoners. This
castle has a cursed history and it’s currently

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:02.750
being run by the Mountain, who picks a new
person to be tortured to death every day.

00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:07.050
After a horrible few nights it’s eventually
Gendry’s turn, but just in time Lord Tywin

00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:11.140
Lannister arrives to make this his war H.Q.
and has the prisoners put to use around the

00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:15.220
place instead of being just tortured. He clocks
that Arry is in fact a girl and makes her

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:18.400
his new cupbearer.
And reaching the edge of the Red Wastes one

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:22.650
of Dany’s riders report they have discovered
the city of Qarth, which might be their only

00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:26.310
hope. So they all head over but there’s
a bit of a culture clash at the gates and

00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:30.740
they risk being barred entry and left to die.
However one of them called Xaro Xhoan Daxos

00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:35.920
vouches for her out of dragon curiosity and
things are finally starting to look up.

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:39.820
Stannis treats with his brother Renly - One
is the older and more rightful king, the other

00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:43.450
better loved with the larger army – But
Catelyn doesn’t have time for squabbling

00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:48.130
and tries to remind them all of the common
enemy, the Lannisters. No good comes of the

00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:52.690
meeting however and the threat of battle between
their two armies looms for the next day.

00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:56.890
That night however Stannis gets Ser Davos
to pick up his former smuggling skills and

00:10:56.890 --> 00:11:01.810
sneak the Red Priestess into a cove near Renly’s
location. If he wasn’t unnerved by her freaky

00:11:01.810 --> 00:11:06.910
sorcery before then he sure now. Because Melisandre
gives birth to a living black shadow that

00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:10.530
takes dark form.
Meanwhile Renly and Catelyn seem to reach

00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:15.680
a late night accord, agreeing on a Stark &amp; Baratheon
alliance. But in sweeps the shadow with the

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:19.910
face of Stannis and it Kills Renly before
disappearing. Some of the guards think Brienne

00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:23.460
must have done it, and Catelyn escapes with
her before people get rash.

00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:27.790
Brienne sees a woman’s courage in Catelyn
and enters into her service, so long as she’s

00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:32.140
allowed to kill Stannis in revenge.
So with Renly now dead Littlefinger schemes

00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:36.640
with his former Queen before Stannis arrives
to take charge of his army. Davos tries to

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:40.400
tell Stannis of the creepy shit he saw the
other night. But for some reason the King

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:44.880
will not hear of it. Though does concede to
leave Melisandre at home when he attacks King’s

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:47.100
Landing.
In the capitol Cersei drinks to the death

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:50.840
of Renley (she’s been drinking a lot lately)
and Tyrion discovers that she’s planning

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:56.430
on using wildfire to defend the city, a highly
volatile and dangerous kind of green napalm

00:11:56.430 --> 00:12:00.700
that the alchemists are brewing up for her.
So Tyrion visits the alchemists himself to

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:04.850
discover huge underground vaults of the stuff
and takes over the operation instead.

00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:09.420
Theon gets mocked by his new crew and hatches
a plan to actually make a sneak attack on

00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:13.860
Winterfell, a grand prize that will hopefully
make the Ironborn respect him. Despite having

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:17.010
been raised there.
He attacks a town, 40 leagues from the castle,

00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:21.580
and Bran in response has Ser Rodrik Cassel
take two hundred men over to defend it, leaving

00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:25.580
Winterfell essentially unguarded. It’s then
that Bran tells Osha he dreamed of the sea

00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:29.620
coming up and washing all over the castle.
At Harrenhall Tywin is unaware that his cupbearer

00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:33.860
is actually Arya Stark and she discovers that
one of the prisoners they were travelling

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:38.500
with has somehow embedded himself as a Lannister
solider. Because Arya saved his life and the

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:42.620
two chained up with him, this strange guy
offers to kill three people for her in return.

00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:46.760
So first off the top of her head is the Tickler
who was torturing people earlier, and boom

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:50.090
falls and breaks his neck.
The Knight’s Watch make it up to the fist

00:12:50.090 --> 00:12:54.690
of the first men, an ancient place where they
set up camp and meet with more black brothers

00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:59.370
from the shadow tower, led by Qhorin Halfhand,
a tough gnarled ranger who plans to sneak

00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:03.860
over to the wildling army and kill the king
beyond the wall before they organise an attack

00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:08.030
South. Jon volunteers to join them and a small
team of five head out.

00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:12.520
In the City of Qarth Dany and her crew are
treated as honoured guests of high society,

00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:16.790
and she is further welcomed on behalf of the
warlocks by creepy Pyat Pree who advises her

00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:21.080
to come visit them at the house of the undying
sometime. This party is full of odd strangers,

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:25.700
as a masked woman warns Jorah to stay by Dany’s
side and guard her against those that would

00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:29.400
take her dragons.
Xaro offers to marry Dany, and with Westeros

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:33.060
split, half of his wealth could buy ships
and an army for her although he’ll want

00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:37.090
a Dragon in return, and it becomes clear that
Ser Jorah is in love with her while she mulls

00:13:37.090 --> 00:13:41.370
things over. Dany tries to get ships independently
from the rest of the 13, but fails.

00:13:41.370 --> 00:13:44.550
06
Theon has led a sneak attack and claimed Winterfell,

00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:48.310
and Bran is just like: “Why I thought you
lived here!?” He convinces Bran to yield

00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:52.740
the castle, but everybody calls him a scumbag
to his face, and in order to look tough he

00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:57.470
has to Kill Ser Rodrik for spitting on him.
He even manages to make a pig’s ear of that.

00:13:57.470 --> 00:14:00.700
- Aww god I hate you!
Jon and the Shadow Tower men are out to kill

00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:04.350
some wildling scouts before they raise the
alarm on the rest of the Watch. They sneak

00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:08.720
up for the kill but Jon catches a girl, and
they question her but she’s fearless. Jon

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:12.930
is left to finisher her off but he hesitates
and she escapes for a bit before he then takes

00:14:12.930 --> 00:14:15.640
her as a prisoner.
And then they cuddle up in the cold while

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:19.800
she’s tied up, so I don’t really know
what Jon thinks is happening right now.

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:24.120
Princess Marcella is being shipped off South
to Dorne as part of an alliance, and Cersei

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:27.730
tells Tyrion she will take away someone he
loves for this - Lovely! On the way back from

00:14:27.730 --> 00:14:31.990
the docs however the crowd turns nasty on
the royal party, so Joff wants them killed

00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:35.730
and a full on riot kicks off!
The fat Septon is torn apart, and after the

00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:39.870
Goldcloaks rush out Joffrey, Tyron gives him
another good slap for being such a stupid

00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:44.660
piece of shit. Sansa is almost raped but saved
by the Hound who returns her to the Keep.

00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:48.960
At Harrenhall Arya crosses paths with Ser
Amoury Lorch, so she puts in a panic-request

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:54.190
with Jaqen H'ghar (her mysterious murder friend)
who gets to Lorch just before he gets to Tywin.

00:14:54.190 --> 00:14:58.870
And Littlefinger (who seems to be travelling
everywhere) visits Tywin to suggest a Tyrell

00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:02.400
alliance, by basically having Margery marry
Joff instead of Sansa.

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:06.140
Robb and that girl he likes flirt some more
at the camp but his mum is back for the cock-block

00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:09.910
and reminds him he’s betrothed to a Frey.
Roose Bolton delivers the bad news however

00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:14.320
about Theon taking Winterfell, but Robb can’t
afford to march back home during the war,

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:19.020
so Roose offers to send word to his bastard
son Ramsay to go kick Theon out.

00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:22.710
Seeing as Osha was part captive during the
good times, Theon decides to free her after

00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:26.970
she takes off her clothes! But after some
bed-fun she helps Bran, Rickon and Hodor escape

00:15:26.970 --> 00:15:29.970
with the wolves.
Meanwhile Dany’s not really getting anything

00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:34.000
done in Qarth until her dragons are stolen
and someone and some of her Dothraki killed.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.050
Where are my dragons?
So Theon’s angry that the boys escaped and

00:15:38.050 --> 00:15:42.480
doesn’t like to be reminded he was duped
by Osha like a mug. They hunt after the Starks

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:46.450
with Maester Luwin who’s not happy to be
there, but the boys can’t be found. So in

00:15:46.450 --> 00:15:50.210
order to look like he’s a badass and not
actually a looser he kills two random farm

00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:52.960
boys and burns the bodies to claim they’re
Starks!

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:57.360
Jon wakes up slightly regretting the creepy-sleepy
with his Wildling captive and she chides him

00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:01.740
for being a Crow that’s never had sex. See
the Wildling ideology is all about freedom

00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:05.410
and not being bound by other people’s rules
which doesn’t work with Jon’s outlook.

00:16:05.410 --> 00:16:09.490
It’s Gypsies versus Houses all over again.
Anyway this girl is called Ygritte, and she

00:16:09.490 --> 00:16:13.890
tries to convince Jon to join them and be
free, maybe even take her for his woman. See

00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:17.540
Jon’s basically lost and he can’t find
the other brothers he headed out with before

00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:21.380
– Oh no! Now he’s the captive!
Up in the ruined castle of Harrenhall Tywin

00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:25.570
tells Arya the importance of dragons and legacy
over some dinner because there like mates

00:16:25.570 --> 00:16:29.020
now or something? Even though he still thinks
she’s just a cupbearer.

00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:33.130
Sansa thanks the Hound for saving her life
but he spits it back in her face, Clegane

00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:37.320
is angry at a world full of hypocrisy, and
he then discovers that Sansa has flowered,

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:41.880
which unfortunately for her means its soon
time to marry Joffrey, and Cersei doesn’t

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:45.970
even try to pretend that it’s gonna anything
but miserable for her. She even chills out

00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:49.340
with Tyrion later and admits her son is a
cruel monster.

00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:53.420
Over at Robb’s Northern army the sexy samaritan
is almost luring the King of the North out

00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:57.930
of his pants by now, while captive Jamie reminisces
with one of his distant cousins who’s another

00:16:57.930 --> 00:17:02.250
Lannister hostage, before he kills the lad
to lure in the guard in and make his escape.

00:17:02.250 --> 00:17:05.860
That’s Dark! And short-lived – Now the
dead guard’s father who is the Lord of house

00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:10.770
Karstark wants Jaime’s head in revenge and
that’s causing some serious friction - Jaime’s

00:17:10.770 --> 00:17:14.060
real plan all along.
In order to avoid mutiny and the loss of such

00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:18.420
a precious hostage, Catelyn send Jaime away
with Brienne to hopefully get exchanged for

00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:23.150
Sansa and Arya. Robb and Lord Karstark are
furious at her and send men in pursuit.

00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:27.819
Dany beseeches the 13 of Qarth for help with
finding her dragons, but it turns out the

00:17:27.819 --> 00:17:31.700
creepy warlocks took them with the help of
Xaro Xhoan Daxos, who’s been plotting to

00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:35.980
make himself a King! Those pesky warlocks
are everywhere so Dany does nothing for a

00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:40.310
bit in order to pad out her story arc.
Theon’s sister Yara rides to Winterfell

00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:44.820
to tell him he’s weak and stupid for killing
the boys. Theon thought she was bringing reinforcements

00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:48.740
to hold the castle, but she’s here to convince
him to do something smart for once and leave

00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:51.660
back for the Iron islands. He’s going to
stay however.

00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:55.430
The Wildlings take captive Jon to the Lord
of bones (don’t know where he gets the name

00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:59.280
from), who has killed the other Black Brothers
and captured Qhorin Halfhand whilst they were

00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:01.362
away.
They’re being marched North to see the King

00:18:01.362 --> 00:18:04.960
beyond the wall when Qhorin tells Jon to go
over to their side if they’ll have him and

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:09.060
learn all he can about them. Making it look
like he hates Jon as a traitor in order to

00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:11.830
convince the others.
The rest of the Castle Black crewe are still

00:18:11.830 --> 00:18:16.210
at the Fist of the first men, while Sam and
friends discover an old cache full of Dragonglass

00:18:16.210 --> 00:18:19.610
blades and arrows.
On the road Jaime and Brienne sneak themselves

00:18:19.610 --> 00:18:23.710
a boat, and although Jaime tries to anger
her into doing something stupid, she’s too

00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:27.790
stubborn to be goaded by her captive.
Tywin Lannister is on the move with his army,

00:18:27.790 --> 00:18:32.360
and Arya is gonna be left with the Mountain’s
awful garrison at Harrenhall. She realises

00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:36.210
she’s been an idiot for not having Jaqen
H'ghar kill Twyin all this time and now she

00:18:36.210 --> 00:18:39.990
can’t find him! And when he does finally
show up from patrol she tricks him into promising

00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:44.620
to kill himself, unless he now helps her escape
with Gendry and this other kid, Hot Pie.

00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:49.090
So that night they simply walk out of the
gates, all the guards on duty assassinated

00:18:49.090 --> 00:18:52.540
by different means.
Tyrion is planning the defence of the capitol

00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:56.440
and Cersei tells him that she has his whore
who’ll be killed if Joffrey ends up dying

00:18:56.440 --> 00:19:00.610
in the battle. She actually has the wrong
girl however so Tyrion plays along and tells

00:19:00.610 --> 00:19:03.660
Cersei that he will one day see her joy turned
to ashes.

00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:08.080
He then goes off bang Shae, but Tyrion seems
to have forgotten that this is was an arrangement

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:13.130
and has unfortunately fallen in love. Oh dear.
In fact while on the topic Robb has fallen

00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:17.540
in love with the girl from Volantis, Talisa.
After hearing her life story and seeing her

00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:22.150
kind heart he betrays his betrothal to the
Freys - by banging her right in the war tent!

00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:26.780
At sea, we discover that Ser Davos the Onion
Knight earned his title when he smuggled food

00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:30.581
to Stannis at Storm’s End in the middle
of a siege, and this simple crabber’s son

00:19:30.581 --> 00:19:35.010
has grown to be his right hand man for his
constant loyal and honest council.

00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:39.690
And now in the dark of night Stannis sails
toward King’s landing with Salladhor Saan’s

00:19:39.690 --> 00:19:42.380
fleet.
While preparing to defend the city, Bronn

00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:46.240
and the Hound size each other up as to who’s
the better killer before being interrupted

00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:49.800
by the invading army.
As Tyrion readies for battle Varys confides

00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:54.790
in him that he believes in and despises magic
and the dark artsclaiming Stannis must never

00:19:54.790 --> 00:19:58.980
sit the throne. Tyrion has a plan involving
the wildfire operation, and Joffrey makes

00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:03.100
Sansa kiss his new sword before he defends
the city. But she gets the odd cheeky word

00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:07.300
in now that she’s growing tired of his shit.
It would be lovely if Joffrey died in battle

00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:11.840
but Tyrion is actually doing his best to keep
everyone alive by leading the defence.

00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:16.600
As the Bells of King’s Landing ring, Davos
has the fleet beat the war drums in response,

00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:20.580
and wonders why the Lannister fleet isn’t
defending the shore. There is only one ship

00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:25.660
between Stannis and the city, and Davos realises
too late that it’s packed with wildfire.

00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:30.980
In a single moment a huge part of the invading
fleet is obliterated by the alchemist’s

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:36.470
unquenchable flames. Including Davos’ son.
Over the press of screams, Stannis pushes

00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:40.900
on with the rest to land and storm the gates.
While Cersei is getting drunk with Sansa and

00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:44.570
the highborn women holed up in the Keep, telling
her how much they’ll be raped if they lose

00:20:44.570 --> 00:20:47.371
the fight.
Fire arrows rain down on Stannis’ force

00:20:47.371 --> 00:20:51.400
before they reach the walls and make for the
Mud Gate, but the Hound rides out to lead

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:55.750
a bloody sortie and Lancel Lannister takes
an arrow before reporting back to the queen

00:20:55.750 --> 00:21:00.060
about the battle so far. So Cersei immediately
demands that Joffrey removed from the walls

00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:02.680
to safety.
Now there’s a problem at the Mud Gate – the

00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:07.230
only thing the Hound has ever feared is fire,
and these burning men are bit much for him,

00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:11.260
so he hangs back for a drink and a rest, and
when Tyrion and Joffrey gives him shit for

00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:15.340
this, he says fuck the King, and leaves.
Joff hides away back to the keep and all of

00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:20.300
the defenders almost lose hope, until Tyrion
steps up, rouses the troops and leads the

00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:23.780
attack himself on Stannis’ – Ah, Love
this guy!

00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:28.390
Shae sends Sansa to her bedchambers to bar
the door, but the hound is here, tired of

00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:33.240
everything and drunk. He offers to take Sansa
home to Winterfell, but she stays stupid and

00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:36.150
he leaves.
Stannis has a toehold on the battlements,

00:21:36.150 --> 00:21:40.120
whilst Tyrions counterattack leads to a bloody
mess of a battle, where one of the Goldcloaks

00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:44.630
tries to kill him, but is murdered just in
time by Tyrion’s squire. As he lays stunned

00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:49.520
and slipping into unconsciousness a third
army arrives, the Baratheon banner flies but

00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:53.760
the new force that’s smashing Stannis’
men is led by Loras Tyrell of Highgarden and

00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:59.490
commanded by Tywin Lannister himself. Stannis
is forced to retreat! The Lannisters have

00:21:59.490 --> 00:22:02.000
won.
Also Cersei was just about to poison Tommen

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.540
but I guess were not gonna talk about that?
Tyrion wakes scarred from the battle in a

00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:08.940
dingy room, and Pycell enjoys telling him
that he’s no longer the Hand of the King

00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:13.500
with Tywin back in town. In great ceremony
Joff proclaims Tywin saviour and hand. It

00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:17.830
was Petyr Baelish’s idea to Ally with the
Tyrells, for which he is granted Harrenhall,

00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:22.130
and in a rehearsed bit of B.S., they talk
of how Margery never banged Renly, so she’s

00:22:22.130 --> 00:22:26.730
still fresh to marry Joffrey instead of Sansa,
who is set aside because of her traitor family.

00:22:26.730 --> 00:22:30.700
This is great news for Sansa but Littlefinger
reminds her of the creepy truth that Joff

00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:34.450
is still going to abuse her in lots of ways,
in and out the bedroom.

00:22:34.450 --> 00:22:38.930
Ser Mandon Moore, the Goldclak who tried killing
Tyrion did so on the orders of Cersei, and

00:22:38.930 --> 00:22:42.840
Varys also tells him that his mountain clansmen
were been paid and sent home, and Bronn was

00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:47.290
dismissed as captain of the Goldcloaks. Yet
despite the scars on his face Shae still puts

00:22:47.290 --> 00:22:50.980
on a good show and sticks by his side. It’s
hard to tell if she means it or if she’s

00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:52.930
still on the clock, but don’t get your hopes
up.

00:22:52.930 --> 00:22:56.870
Brienne is still marching Jaime back home
for the hostage swap, but when they’re recognised

00:22:56.870 --> 00:23:01.060
by three scumbags she’s forced to murder
the shit out of them! Daym! Jaime’s cocky

00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:05.190
banter is suddenly replaced with regard.
Robb is still mad at his mother for cutting

00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:09.560
him loose however and marries Talisa in an
unusually stupid move for a king.

00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:13.460
Back on Dragonstone Stannis licks his wounds
and gets a little wife-beaty on Melisandre

00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:17.980
for promising him victory based on her visions.
But she convinces him not to doubt and continue

00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:21.840
on to his path of glory.
Up at Winterfell Theon is surrounded by Northmen

00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:26.380
forces because he was too stupid and proud
to leave with Yara. Luwin urges him to run

00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:30.280
North and join the Night’s Watch before
the castle is taken. But instead he rallies

00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:34.540
his men for a glorious last stand that will
be sung for years to come before, you know,

00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:37.440
before his own men knock him out and go home.
And stab Luwin!

00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:40.980
While back on the road Jaqen catches up with
Arya and she asks him to teach her the ways

00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:44.860
of killing. He suggests that she come with
him across the Narrow sea to Braavos to join

00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:49.630
the faceless men, a cult of master assassins
who change identity with ease. Arya has to

00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:54.440
stay to find her family however, so Jaqen
gives her an ancient coin, some ancient words,

00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:58.170
and becomes someone else, and leaves.
Bran and Rickon were hiding in the crypts

00:23:58.170 --> 00:24:02.300
of Winterfell this whole time with Hodor and
Osha. They surface to discover the castle

00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:06.410
abandoned and put to the torch. The direwolves
are back but Luwin tells them they must head

00:24:06.410 --> 00:24:10.400
north to the wall and meet up with Jon because
it’s too dangerous to find Robb in the middle

00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:14.580
of the War. Luwin is given peace and there
is no longer a Stark in Winterfell.

00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:19.080
Dany finally goes to the house of the undying
to face their sorcery and tricks, entering

00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:23.340
the tower alone and seeing a vision of a ruined
King’s Landing in the dead of Winter. She

00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:27.020
reaches for the Iron Throne but doesn’t
quite touch it before following the sounds

00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:31.110
of her dragons. Her next sight is North of
the wall where she finds Drogo and their son

00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:35.860
in a Summer tent, again she leaves, and discovers
her dragons, chained to an altar and surrounded

00:24:35.860 --> 00:24:39.480
by creepy warlocks.
Turns out the world of magic has grown stronger

00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:43.620
since the return of dragons, and the warlocks
plan to keep them and Dany hostage forever

00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:48.170
to feed their power. But instead the little
mites burn the warlock to death. So Dany has

00:24:48.170 --> 00:24:52.710
Xaro Xhoan Daxos locked in his own vault as
a thankyou and sells his stuff to buy a ship.

00:24:52.710 --> 00:24:56.610
On the march towards the army of the King
beyond the Wall, Qhorin attacks Jon and lets

00:24:56.610 --> 00:25:00.860
himself be killed for the good of the Watch.
Jon is accepted amongst the Wildlings for

00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:04.840
this, but back at the Fist of the first men
Sam and the others hear three blasts of the

00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:09.100
horn. This is an ancient signal of the Watch
that means Others are coming. And we a living

00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:13.660
army of the dead marching on their position,
led by a Whitewalker on his corpse horse.

00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:17.890
Oh my god!
So Tyrion’s no longer Hand despite his hard

00:25:17.890 --> 00:25:22.010
work, and Sansa is pretty much exactly where
she started. Stannis is beaten for now, and

00:25:22.010 --> 00:25:25.559
Arya is still trying to make her way home,
whilst Bran is heading North to the wall with

00:25:25.559 --> 00:25:29.230
Rickon. Jon is about to play the spy amongst
Wildlings, and whilst Theon’s been knocked

00:25:29.230 --> 00:25:33.300
out Robb’s thinking with his dick. But more
importantly the living dead are on the move

00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:36.981
and maybe none of that other stuff really
matters. And also Dany’s about to take a

00:25:36.981 --> 00:25:41.280
boat somewhere, but to be honest in the books
what she gets up to was way better.

00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:45.309
