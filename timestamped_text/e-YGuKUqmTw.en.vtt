00:00:06.551 --> 00:00:07.767
hey what's up guys

00:00:07.895 --> 00:00:11.415
today I'll show you a comedy horror film: "Witching &amp; Bitching" 

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:14.487
spoiler ahead, watch out and take care

00:00:14.807 --> 00:00:19.863
Adam's hormone partner Eva, rides a motorcycle through the forest in a cool and carefree way

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:22.999
she pulls up in front of a stump to meet up with two witches

00:00:23.191 --> 00:00:27.223
Eva's Granny, a grey-haired witch(Granny) is using cards for divination 

00:00:27.287 --> 00:00:30.039
and concludes that a good fortune is underway

00:00:30.231 --> 00:00:34.519
in a Spanish city, José and his gaggle of accomplices show up to an event 

00:00:34.583 --> 00:00:36.887
dressed in miscellaneous fancy costumes

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.279
José comes as "Jesus", with his body painted silver 

00:00:40.535 --> 00:00:45.591
while his partner in crime Antonio arrives as a toy soldier, resplendent in green

00:00:45.783 --> 00:00:50.647
along with them are SpongeBob, Minnie Mouses, Headless Man, and a few  

00:00:50.967 --> 00:00:55.127
José and Antonio are moving towards their targeted pawnshop slowly 

00:00:55.319 --> 00:00:57.815
as soon as José's son (Son) calls him from the pawnshop

00:00:57.943 --> 00:01:00.439
José steps inside to start the robbery 

00:01:00.567 --> 00:01:03.767
José takes out a gun from his cross to fire at the glass shelves 

00:01:03.895 --> 00:01:07.543
and threatens the shop assistants to fill his bag with gold rings

00:01:07.735 --> 00:01:12.023
Antonio joins José in the action and blames him for bringing his damned son 

00:01:12.279 --> 00:01:14.647
José only gets custody of him once a week

00:01:14.839 --> 00:01:18.103
so it seems logical to take him along on a pawn shop hold-up

00:01:18.295 --> 00:01:22.903
in fact, the robbery is staged to pay his alimony and provide for his son

00:01:23.415 --> 00:01:26.359
at this moment, a security guard senses something is wrong 

00:01:26.551 --> 00:01:28.791
and approaches the shop for inspection 

00:01:28.919 --> 00:01:33.463
to stop the guard's intervention, SpongeBob dashes over to shoot the guard down

00:01:33.783 --> 00:01:37.367
the tourists are thrown into chaos and evacuate in all directions 

00:01:37.559 --> 00:01:41.591
the policemen who are patrolling the street come at once and kill SpongeBob 

00:01:41.847 --> 00:01:46.647
Patrick Star hugs SpongeBob and cries while the rest of the characters flee the crime scene 

00:01:46.711 --> 00:01:52.535
distracted by various escapees, the cops do not notice the shop door, which opens quietly

00:01:52.791 --> 00:01:58.871
at gunpoint, José, Antonio, and Son hijack a taxi cab and take the police on a chase 

00:01:59.063 --> 00:02:02.903
the taxi initially carries the driver (Driver) and a noisy stout passenger (Passenger) 

00:02:02.967 --> 00:02:04.823
who ends up being thrown into the trunk 

00:02:04.951 --> 00:02:07.063
Driver plans to escape the horrid journey 

00:02:07.191 --> 00:02:11.991
but after hearing José and Antonio's fear and hatred of women, he opts in for the risk 

00:02:12.247 --> 00:02:16.471
it turns out José is in conflict with his ex-wife (Ex-wife) over the custody of their Son

00:02:16.727 --> 00:02:21.783
Antonio is terrified of his more horny girlfriend and unable to feed her hormone appetites

00:02:22.167 --> 00:02:25.239
Driver is also adamant, being constantly bad-mouthed 

00:02:25.367 --> 00:02:28.887
by a tea-meeting conspiracy of his mother, sister, and wife

00:02:29.271 --> 00:02:32.471
united by a deep sense of unease and insecurity regarding women

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:34.839
the crew are heading to the Spanish border 

00:02:35.095 --> 00:02:36.951
back to the police's investigation

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:41.751
the arrested culprits reveal more details for the armed robbery that happened previously

00:02:42.071 --> 00:02:46.679
Antonio first discovered many divorced couples selling their wedding rings at the gold exchange 

00:02:46.743 --> 00:02:49.367
so they kidnapped the original costumed characters, dumped them into the sewer

00:02:49.495 --> 00:02:52.247
and replaced them for the show 

00:02:52.503 --> 00:02:55.895
with some clues found, the police notify Ex-wife of the crime

00:02:56.023 --> 00:03:00.311
she visits the police station and identifies her son from the surveillance video

00:03:00.503 --> 00:03:05.367
however, as José is painted from head to toe, the cops cannot recognize his face 

00:03:05.495 --> 00:03:09.015
therefore, they request Ex-wife to provide some photos of José 

00:03:09.143 --> 00:03:12.791
to their dismay, Ex-wife does not keep any traces of José

00:03:12.919 --> 00:03:15.351
even his face is ripped out of every picture 

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:20.535
in response to the police's slow actions, Ex-wife goes after her son using her cellphone 

00:03:20.663 --> 00:03:24.311
two cops in charge of the case have to follow Ex-wife in panic 

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:28.175
after a bumpy ride, the crew come to the witch Granny's restaurant

00:03:28.294 --> 00:03:32.710
when Driver goes to dump his shit, he sees a rolling eye staring at him in the toilet bowl 

00:03:32.774 --> 00:03:34.694
and leaves the bathroom in terror

00:03:35.014 --> 00:03:39.878
when asked which town they will ride into next, Granny tells them it is Zugarramurdi

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:44.806
Driver is more afraid now, for Zugarramurdi is an old village populated by witches 

00:03:45.062 --> 00:03:47.558
however, Granny dismisses such myths 

00:03:47.814 --> 00:03:52.166
Son alone plays around outside the restaurant and is brought back by a grandpa (Grandpa) 

00:03:52.486 --> 00:03:55.494
Driver notices a woman handling a broken leg in the kitchen

00:03:55.558 --> 00:03:57.606
and cannot wait to leave the restaurant 

00:03:57.734 --> 00:04:02.982
what is funny is that the two cops tailing Ex-wife also lament their lot at the hands of women  

00:04:03.238 --> 00:04:08.230
due to all the terrible things he knows about Zugarramurdi, Driver refuses to go further 

00:04:08.486 --> 00:04:11.238
he recalls his uncomfortable experience at the restaurant

00:04:11.366 --> 00:04:15.014
but José slaps him and warns him not to scare his son with ghost stories 

00:04:15.334 --> 00:04:19.110
Driver has no choice but drives the car slowly into the fog 

00:04:19.366 --> 00:04:22.566
all of a sudden, their car crashes into the wandering Granny

00:04:22.694 --> 00:04:27.622
Antonio checks her health status by touching her neck, but Driver and José stop him 

00:04:27.814 --> 00:04:31.398
when they are debating what to do, the witch vanishes without their notice 

00:04:31.654 --> 00:04:34.662
José learns from his son that the witch flies off in the dark 

00:04:34.918 --> 00:04:38.374
everyone hurries back to the cab and move on with their journey 

00:04:38.694 --> 00:04:42.982
as their car safely leaves Zugarramurdi, another woman stands in their way 

00:04:43.302 --> 00:04:47.078
she is a 40-year-old lady searching for her mother and pleads for a hitchhike 

00:04:47.718 --> 00:04:49.766
the crew then sends her to a huge castle

00:04:49.894 --> 00:04:53.275
where they are met with cool and leather-clad Eva, Adam's hormone partner

00:04:53.275 --> 00:04:56.230
it turns out that the middle-aged lady is Eva's mom (Mom)

00:04:56.294 --> 00:05:01.375
Antonio immediately falls for Eva, but Eva is more interested in José, the "Jesus"

00:05:02.182 --> 00:05:06.854
they do not intend to stay, but as Son disappears, José enters the castle to look for him 

00:05:06.982 --> 00:05:11.270
Antonio, fascinated by Eva, wants to spend more time with her

00:05:11.398 --> 00:05:14.662
so Driver is forced to step into the castle with the rest 

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:17.222
love sparks off between Eva and José 

00:05:17.286 --> 00:05:20.550
and they almost fall into a tongue massage in Antonio's presence 

00:05:20.742 --> 00:05:24.198
Antonio has to remind José that Son is missing in action 

00:05:24.326 --> 00:05:28.934
while the two enjoy their hormone interactions with Eva, Driver is filled with fears alone

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:34.694
at the kitchen, they find Son being stripped off his clothes, tied up, and placed in the oven

00:05:34.822 --> 00:05:39.250
Granny even stuffs an apple into Son's mouth, making him like a turkey to be roasted 

00:05:39.525 --> 00:05:44.325
José rescues his Son at once and leaves the castle although Eva apologizes to him 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.344
on the way, they dump Passenger on the side of the road

00:05:47.536 --> 00:05:51.760
as their car approaches the custom, José orders Driver to return to the witch's house

00:05:51.952 --> 00:05:54.256
for he has accidentally left the loot there 

00:05:54.448 --> 00:05:58.224
after they make the u-turn, they put the passenger back into the trunk 

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:03.024
José and Antonio sneak into the castle while Son and Driver remain in the cab 

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:08.400
while exploring the castle, Antonio chances upon Eva posing sultrily in her bikini 

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:13.392
seeing Antonio losing his senses, José awakens him that they must find the golden rings

00:06:13.584 --> 00:06:17.040
later, they realize that the bag of treasure is left in the kitchen 

00:06:17.296 --> 00:06:21.712
when José grabs hold of the loot, he also grabs the attention of Mom and Granny 

00:06:22.032 --> 00:06:25.040
needless to say, the four of them start a fierce fight 

00:06:25.232 --> 00:06:28.176
Mom and Granny crawl on the ceiling freely like spiders 

00:06:28.432 --> 00:06:31.952
after firing a few shots, José and Antonio run to the exit 

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:36.048
but are soon captured and tortured by the witches with their long juicy tongues

00:06:36.176 --> 00:06:38.160
there is no peace for the cab, either 

00:06:38.608 --> 00:06:43.152
Eva hops onto the window of the car, sending a shiver down the Driver's spines 

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:46.032
Driver starts the car in an attempt to get rid of Eva 

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.744
unfortunately, they crash into a tree and are forced to alight 

00:06:50.064 --> 00:06:54.352
Eva continues to pursue them and eventually brings back Driver and Passenger

00:06:54.544 --> 00:06:58.800
on the other side, Ex-wife visits the restaurant and talks with Grandpa for information

00:06:59.012 --> 00:07:02.596
however, she has to rush out due to the toilet harassment 

00:07:02.852 --> 00:07:07.012
the police officers want to call for help, but poor reception kills off their hope 

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:10.468
so they continue to follow Ex-wife with complaints and grumbles 

00:07:10.596 --> 00:07:14.628
in the castle, José, Antonio, Driver, and Passenger 

00:07:14.756 --> 00:07:16.484
are tied up to the chairs in the dining hall 

00:07:16.804 --> 00:07:21.284
Eva, Adam's hormone partner, does not forget to seduce José while setting the table 

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:25.380
Mom takes a stroll on the ceiling and invites her fellow witch friends to the dinner 

00:07:25.508 --> 00:07:27.876
and mentions something about the holy child 

00:07:28.132 --> 00:07:32.932
Son alone walks out from the frost in a blanket and tries to flag down a car for help  

00:07:33.316 --> 00:07:37.732
in fact, it is Ex-wife's car, but she is too busy to notice her own son

00:07:37.924 --> 00:07:41.050
even worse, the policemen behind her also ignore the son

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:43.620
mistaking him as a hairless wild boar

00:07:43.812 --> 00:07:48.484
unfortunately, Son stops Granny's car and thus is kidnapped by Granny and Grandpa

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:51.620
and pushed into the car loaded with frozen human limbs 

00:07:52.004 --> 00:07:56.356
in the castle, Eva plucks out Passenger's teeth and almost strangles him to death 

00:07:56.804 --> 00:08:01.476
terrified by such violence, José secretly takes a knife to cut Antonio's rope 

00:08:01.604 --> 00:08:05.764
but because he cannot use his hand freely, he cuts into Antonio's arm

00:08:05.892 --> 00:08:07.684
and thus creating more pain for him 

00:08:08.068 --> 00:08:12.996
Ex-wife finally notices her son sitting in the witch's car and alerts the cops to help out 

00:08:13.316 --> 00:08:16.324
the trio break into the castle via a secret passage 

00:08:16.452 --> 00:08:19.332
and climbs all the way up to a space above the ceiling 

00:08:19.588 --> 00:08:23.556
at this time, Eva is serving her guests with a plate of fried human fingers 

00:08:23.748 --> 00:08:25.668
seeing his fingers all turned into food

00:08:25.732 --> 00:08:30.212
Passenger groans with fear, and three other men squeeze their brains for solutions 

00:08:30.468 --> 00:08:34.436
Driver advises José to flirt with Eva and win her over with hormones

00:08:34.756 --> 00:08:40.132
shortly after, Granny, Grandpa, Son, and a dozen of other witches walk into the dining hall 

00:08:40.452 --> 00:08:43.524
as the host, Mom declares the opening of her dinner party 

00:08:43.716 --> 00:08:47.236
addressing the witches, she criticizes existing religions 

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:49.732
and condemns man for being useless creatures 

00:08:50.052 --> 00:08:53.828
they are looking forward to the holy child to be born through the holy virgin 

00:08:53.956 --> 00:08:56.388
and overthrow the men's world by the holy child 

00:08:56.580 --> 00:09:01.316
previous rituals have all failed, and this will be the 32nd ritual they are holding 

00:09:01.636 --> 00:09:03.748
but Mom is confident in the upcoming ceremony 

00:09:03.876 --> 00:09:06.884
because the child has come with a full bag of wedding rings 

00:09:07.012 --> 00:09:08.996
the source of power which they need 

00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:13.348
now the two officers and Ex-wife have reached the ceiling above the dining hall

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:16.420
however, the ceiling is too weak to hold their weight 

00:09:16.548 --> 00:09:19.236
so they end up falling onto the dining table 

00:09:19.556 --> 00:09:23.268
in the chaos, José, Antonio, and Driver rip off the rope 

00:09:23.396 --> 00:09:25.700
and fight their way out against many witches 

00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:28.452
the dinner is then turned into a fierce fight 

00:09:28.772 --> 00:09:31.396
unlucky Ex-wife is captured by the witches 

00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:34.916
and forced to consume some tainted toad juice and Passenger's smelly ear 

00:09:35.108 --> 00:09:38.564
by doing so, they successfully turn Ex-wife into a witch 

00:09:38.756 --> 00:09:43.748
meanwhile, Eva rescues José, but she is disappointed with the frigidity of his manner

00:09:43.899 --> 00:09:47.867
José confesses his love to the horny Eva, but she is not pleased 

00:09:47.995 --> 00:09:51.771
and she even slaps José so hard that he almost falls over the railing 

00:09:52.027 --> 00:09:56.315
to calm her down, José suddenly gives Eva a passionate tongue massage

00:09:56.571 --> 00:10:00.027
after the massage however,  Eva is filled so full with hormones 

00:10:00.155 --> 00:10:02.139
that she cannot release a tantrum anymore

00:10:02.395 --> 00:10:04.763
so she rolls on the ground as hard as she could

00:10:05.083 --> 00:10:07.850
José then seizes the opportunity to flee the scene 

00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:10.139
and makes his way into the underground chamber

00:10:10.331 --> 00:10:14.747
in the meantime, Antonio and Driver are painstakingly finding their way out 

00:10:14.811 --> 00:10:18.139
little do they know that hordes of witches are waiting for them ahead 

00:10:18.395 --> 00:10:21.851
in the underground chamber, José runs into Eva's brother (Brother)

00:10:21.915 --> 00:10:24.283
who has been imprisoned by Mom for a few decades  

00:10:24.731 --> 00:10:27.355
constant humidity makes Brother's skin rot and peel away 

00:10:27.611 --> 00:10:31.259
the lonely and poor man hugs José  and sheds tears of joy

00:10:31.707 --> 00:10:35.291
back to the rituals, Mom has put on her luxurious Wizard Robe 

00:10:35.483 --> 00:10:38.811
and other witches are busy making necessary preparations 

00:10:39.067 --> 00:10:44.187
enraged by Eva's fall for José, Mom puts her in a coffin and leaves her in the tunnel 

00:10:44.443 --> 00:10:48.923
José frees Brother from his shackles, and the two of them rush to the event to save Son 

00:10:49.243 --> 00:10:52.443
on the way, they discover Eva and takes her out of the coffin 

00:10:52.699 --> 00:10:56.411
Brother teases Eva as she pays such a heavy price for her romance

00:10:56.667 --> 00:10:58.715
but José refuses to untie Eva 

00:10:58.971 --> 00:11:03.963
at the ritual chamber, the two cops, Antonio, and Driver are put up on poles 

00:11:04.027 --> 00:11:05.499
to be lit as human candles 

00:11:05.691 --> 00:11:10.043
at such a depressing moment, one cop declares his hormone fetish for another cop 

00:11:10.299 --> 00:11:14.523
Mom makes fun of the bible verse and arouses the support of countless witches 

00:11:14.907 --> 00:11:18.555
moments later, Grandpa places a huge plate and fork on the table 

00:11:18.811 --> 00:11:20.411
and Ex-wife sets Son on the plate 

00:11:20.667 --> 00:11:24.443
in the singing of the witches, Mom flies up to wander above the cave 

00:11:24.827 --> 00:11:26.811
right then, with the ground shaking

00:11:26.939 --> 00:11:31.163
an ugly goddess resembling a&nbsp;fertility statue (Goddess) makes her grand entry 

00:11:31.483 --> 00:11:35.771
Brother and José arrive in time to witness Goddess swallowing down Son right away

00:11:36.027 --> 00:11:39.419
the struggling Son passes through her throat, chest, intestine

00:11:39.547 --> 00:11:42.491
and leaves her smelly body tainted with mucus 

00:11:42.875 --> 00:11:46.331
with this, Mom declares that Son is the hermaphrodite holy child

00:11:46.459 --> 00:11:48.571
who will lead them to victory over men 

00:11:48.699 --> 00:11:54.011
hearing Son calling José daddy, Goddess picks up Brother and swallows him in one gulp

00:11:54.267 --> 00:11:57.019
to everyone's surprise, Eva appears without chains 

00:11:57.147 --> 00:11:59.771
and claims that she knows how to defeat Goddess 

00:11:59.899 --> 00:12:01.947
as soon as Goddess grabs hold of José

00:12:02.011 --> 00:12:05.531
Eva jumps up to her head and uncoils the rope around her head

00:12:05.659 --> 00:12:10.651
that makes the grotesque gargantuan monster fall on the bonfire, naked and in agony

00:12:10.779 --> 00:12:14.299
after spitting out Brother, Goddess stumbles her way out of the cave

00:12:14.363 --> 00:12:19.419
crashing into the two cops, Antonio and Driver, before trampling Granny to death 

00:12:19.803 --> 00:12:22.491
another battle between man and witches begins 

00:12:22.683 --> 00:12:24.475
José tries to hold his son 

00:12:24.539 --> 00:12:28.955
but only to get mucus thrown up in his face and knocked off by Mom's wand

00:12:29.083 --> 00:12:32.283
but Eva takes Son from Mom and attacks her without mercy 

00:12:32.603 --> 00:12:36.827
in the end, Eva manages to kill her mom by smashing her wand into pieces 

00:12:36.891 --> 00:12:40.411
as a result, all the witches scream hard at her death 

00:12:40.731 --> 00:12:44.315
strangely enough, Ex-wife starts to punch José without stop 

00:12:44.443 --> 00:12:49.691
when José is on the verge of dying, Brother saves him by hitting Ex-wife with an iron cylinder

00:12:49.819 --> 00:12:53.083
eventually, the survivors leave the hell raised by the witches 

00:12:53.595 --> 00:12:57.499
one month later, Son and a little girl are doing a magic show at school 

00:12:57.691 --> 00:13:00.699
José and Eva show up together to support Son

00:13:00.955 --> 00:13:05.435
Antonio boldly tells his girlfriend to take a break from her crazy work schedule 

00:13:05.691 --> 00:13:08.635
the two cops are chatting about where to go for holidays 

00:13:08.891 --> 00:13:12.731
when the magic show ends, the little girl spits out green mucus from her mouth 

00:13:12.923 --> 00:13:17.250
Ex-wife, Mom, and Granny also attend the show and enjoy it much

00:13:17.925 --> 00:13:20.650
