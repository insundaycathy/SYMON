00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.960
Hello Guys, Welcome to the channel. Today,
we will review a movie called "Ex Machina".

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:06.640
So, spoilers ahead.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.000
As the movies starts, we see a man working
hard on his computer.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.160
Then he receives a message that the CEO of
the company has appreciated his hardwork and

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.160
wants him to accompany him for a week.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.040
Hearing this, his friends and colleagues get
excited.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.480
And they begin to congratulate him. The name
of this man is Caleb.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.040
A helicopter arrives to pick Caleb as the
region where CEO resided was accessible only

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.240
through helicopter.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.880
His house is amid of the forest. And he is
living peacefully all alone by himself.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.960
Getting off the helicopter, Caleb casts a
glance at CEO's house in front of him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.400
which is very splendid.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.200
Upon reaching the house, the door asks Caleb
for identification. It quickly scans Caleb

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.200
and hands him an identification card which
will help him get access to the house.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.080
He meets that company CEO as he enters the
house.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.080
Arthur, who is the CEO, greets him very happily
and talks with respect.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.440
Caleb is happy with the welcome that he has
received from his boss.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.760
He thinks, his week will spend joyfully.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.640
Arthur starts to show his house to Caleb while
talking.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.640
Arthur tells Caleb that he can stay in any room he
likes, except of one room.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.360
That one room is forbidden for Caleb to try
to enter.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.640
Arthur then takes Caleb to his room which
is wide and adorable.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.760
Caleb is then handed a contract which is to
be signed by him.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.840
It's written in the contract that whatever
happens inside this house, Caleb isn't allowed

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.160
to disclose any of it to people outside.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:27.200
Caleb thinks that the contract is really weird
and strange. He is scared to sign the contract.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.440
Seeing Caleb's expression, Arthur sits down&nbsp;

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.160
with him and assures that nothing&nbsp;
wrong is going to happen to him.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.840
Arthur also tells Caleb that&nbsp;
if he doesn't want to do this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.120
he is absolutely free to
leave and there is no pressure on him.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.800
So Caleb agrees to sign the contract&nbsp;
as he wants to work with his CEO.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.400
Arthur then tells Caleb that what they&nbsp;
are going to make isn't anything ordinary.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.960
Arthur plans to make a robot that will look
and talk exactly like the humans. In fact,

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.880
the robot will be so perfect that no one will
be able to guess that it is a robot.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.600
Hearing this, Caleb gets very excited. He
says that this project will be ground breaking

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.160
and with each other's cooperation, they can
truly achieve this goal of making a perfect robot.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.800
Next day, Caleb is left in a room which has
glass walls. The room also had cameras through

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.800
which the Arthur was going to monitor the
conversation between Caleb and the robot.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.440
Now humanoid robot appears in front of Caleb.
The robot was designed like a female human

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.560
being and had very strong resemblance to real
life humans.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.160
The robot's name is Ava and she begins to
converse with Caleb.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.240
Caleb feels good when he talks to her.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:31.120
He feels as if he is really talking to a girl.
After their conversation, Caleb tells Arthur

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.840
about the robot. He compliments Arthur about
the work he had already done by himself. He

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.400
tells him that the robot was already human
like. Arthur is happy to hear this. But he

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.680
also tells Caleb that there is much more work
left to be done on her.

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.920
Caleb moves to his room at night. He is feeling
bored as there was nothing for him to do in

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.880
that room. He was having difficulty falling
asleep.

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:56.800
He gets up to watch the TV. He turns the TV
on, but then he sees a CCTV footage. He changes

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.240
channels but all he sees is the different
angles of Ava's room.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.840
The lights suddenly switch off. Then the red
light is turned on.

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.560
Everything looks mysterious&nbsp;
and Caleb is frightened.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.000
He tries to unlock the door to get&nbsp;
out of the room but it doesn't open.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.640
But the door quickly opens after the lights
are back.

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.880
He goes to Arthur and asks what had happened.

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.960
Arthur explains that the security of the house
was designed in such a way that when lights

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:23.440
get turned off, every door in the house get
automatically locked. So, that no one could

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:24.720
break into the house.

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.840
Next morning, Caleb sees a girl in his room.
She brings him breakfast. Caleb is confused

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.160
if she is a robot or an actual human being.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.560
He then asks Arthur about the girl, who tells
him that she was there to help take care of them.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.840
Then Caleb asks, "Where is Ava, I need to
talk to her".

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.800
When they meet, Ava shows Caleb a sketch which
she had drawn.

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.280
Caleb asks her, "What have you sketched".

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.080
Ava wants Caleb to understand what she had
drawn.

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.760
But Caleb fails to understand anything and
tells her to draw something that he could

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.840
easily understand. Ava agrees and then asks
Caleb about his family.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.240
Caleb replies that his parents were no more.
He doesn't have any friends and he has spent

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.680
most of his life alone.

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.800
Ava says "Okay", and then she turns off the
lights of the house to disable the CCTV cameras.

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.600
She doesn't want Arthur to hear-in on their
conversation.

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:14.160
Ava warns Caleb about Arthur and tells him
that Arthur is not a person to be trusted.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.120
After warning Caleb, Ava turns the lights
back on.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.920
Caleb leaves the room and sits with Arthur
to get dinner.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:24.480
The lady worker serves food to Arthur, but
accidentally drops the wine. Arthur gets mad

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:28.960
at her and starts calling her stupid. Caleb
clearly doesn't like the way Arthur is treating

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:29.520
her.

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:34.080
Now, Arthur asks Caleb about the conversation
he had with Ava when the lights had gone.

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.840
Caleb replies, "Nothing special". But Arthur
is very clever.

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.040
He detects that Caleb is surely hiding something
from him.

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:44.160
Arthur brings Caleb to his lab, where he made
the robots.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.560
He says that this is where he created Ava
and then shows him a blue brain like structure.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.000
Arthur explains that this was what he used
to make the brain for Ava.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.240
Caleb looks at it in awe and excitement.

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.320
Then CEO tells, Combining the thoughts of&nbsp;

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.640
the thousands of people and&nbsp;
their facial expression,

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.200
he was able to make this brain for his robots.

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:05.520
So it is very shrewd, sharp and doesn't let
you feel that it is a humanoid robot.

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.480
It is seen in the next scene that Ava comes
to Caleb.

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:11.040
She expresses to him that she has feelings
for him,

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.120
and wants to spend more time with him.

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.520
Caleb replies, "Yeah! Why not".

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:20.800
Now Ava puts on a wig and wears a beautiful
dress. Her robotic body is now covered in

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.240
normal human clothes.

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.160
She looks exactly like a human.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.560
Caleb is also left astonished seeing her.

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.880
Ava asks him, "Do you also like me".

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:33.200
"Do you also think about me". Caleb replies,
"No! Who told you that".

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:37.920
Ava says, "Don't lie! I can read your mind.
I have the power of thinking of thousands

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:38.800
of people".

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.560
"I know that you are telling a lie".

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.440
Caleb gets nervous and accepts that he was
lying.

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:47.040
Caleb goes to Arthur and says that he had
perfectly created the robot.

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:50.000
But Caleb believes that Ava is trying to flirt
with him.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000
Arthur replies that since he made her with
the thinking ability of thousands of people,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.280
it was all normal.

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:59.840
She was just reflecting true and normal human
behavior. In short, she truly was becoming

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:00.560
a human.

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:04.800
Then Caleb begins to think that it is a wrong
thing to do that. It is not fair.

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:09.360
Ava has the same feelings as human beings
and she has been imprisoned in a place.

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:13.920
Caleb in his next meet up with Ava explains
that Human beings and machines are different.

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:18.880
Human beings can change their thoughts. They
have a great power of imagination and creativity.

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:22.640
While machines are confined to think only
of what is fitted in their system.

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:26.320
Machine do not extend their thoughts from
their confined limits in their system.

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:30.720
While the human beings create many opportunities
for themselves to live a life of freedom.

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:34.960
Caleb then asks her, "You are just living
here. Why do you not ever take any step for

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:35.840
yourself".

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:40.160
Now, this message gets set in her system.
She wants freedom and wants to explore the

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:41.920
world outside of this house.

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:45.680
She expresses, she also wants to be a free
spirited human being.

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:50.480
Next day, Arthur tells Caleb that he wants
him to do more test on Ava. But Caleb feels

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:53.520
it is wrong to do any more experiments or
tests on Ava.

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:56.080
But before he could say anything, Arthur leaves.

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:58.240
Ava comes to visit Caleb again.

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:01.600
She says that she knows that Caleb came here
only to test her.

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:06.000
She says that however smart she maybe, she
will never be a perfect human being. So, what

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.240
will they do to her if she fails the test.

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:11.280
She asks if they will destroy her if she fails
to be a human.

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:16.400
Caleb says, "No! How can I say anything. I
know nothing about it! Trust me".

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:20.560
Caleb asks her to trust him and he promises
to bring information from Arthur.

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:24.080
Caleb tells her that he will do everything
in his power to make sure she doesn't get

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:28.240
destroyed. Because he knows that she also
has feelings like humans and will feel the

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:28.880
pain.

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:30.720
Ava then turns the lights off.

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:35.600
Ava begins to tell Caleb that she likes him.
She doesn't want him to leave this place.

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:40.240
She asks him not to destroy her if she fails
the test. She wants to live with Caleb.

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:44.160
Caleb understands that Ava truly has begun
to feel like human beings.

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:48.160
She also has the wish to live a free life
after being released from this place.

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:50.320
Next morning, Caleb meets with Arthur.

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:54.880
He then asks what will happen to Ava if she
fails to get perfect like a human. He asks

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:56.240
if he will destroy her.

00:07:56.240 --> 00:08:00.400
Arthur answers that he will not destroy her,
but he will erase all her memory and deactivate

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:00.720
her.

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:04.880
After that, he will create another brain with
more information and technology behind it.

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:05.280
He will store all the facts in its system
which are in any human being.

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:09.520
Then Caleb thinks, Ava is a robot but she
has the understanding and thinking power of

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:10.800
thousand of people.

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:15.280
She also has emotions. he thinks deactivating
and erasing her memory will be like murdering

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:16.320
a real human.

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:19.040
Caleb decides that he will try to get Ava
out of there.

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:23.520
He makes Arthur drink excessively and after
a while, Arthur loses his consciousness.

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:26.240
Taking his identity card, he moves to his
room.

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:30.320
Caleb then opens Arthur's computer and finds
out that there were many robots that had been

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:31.760
created before Ava.

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:34.640
But they were all deactivated because of having
a little fault.

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:38.480
He sees that one of the robots was begging
to be let out but Arthur doesn't give her

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:39.280
freedom.

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:43.600
Caleb thinks that it is murder! Then he sees
the lady worker, who tears her skin and shows

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:45.520
to Caleb that she too is a robot.

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:50.640
That night, Caleb cannot go to sleep. He keeps
on thinking about the robots. He gets confused

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:52.080
if he too is a robot.

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:56.480
He checks his body and even cuts himself to
make sure that he is a human. Caleb then makes

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:59.840
a plan to release all of the robots from there
and give them freedom.

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:04.080
Caleb meets Ava and tells her that she was
right. She will get destroyed if she fails

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:08.320
to pass the tests. But Caleb ensures her that
he will help her to get out of there.

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:12.880
They make a plan. Caleb will purposely make
Arthur drink excessively. And then he will

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:16.560
change the security system to open all doors
when lights get turned off.

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:20.320
All she has to do is turn the lights off when
Arthur gets drunk and then they can leave

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:23.520
out of there together. Ava agrees to Caleb's
idea.

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:28.320
Next Day, Caleb goes to Arthur and offers
him drink. But to his surprise, Arthur declines

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:33.120
to drink. After that, Arthur tells him that
Caleb's work here was done. A helicopter will

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:34.720
arrive tomorrow to pick him up.

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:38.480
Caleb gets worried thinking who will release
these robots from here if he has to leave

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:39.520
this place.

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:43.040
Arthur notices his worried face and tells
him about his secret.

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:47.920
Arthur plays a video. It is the video of Ava's
room. Arthur reveals that even when the lights

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:50.320
were off, he could still&nbsp;
hear and see the conversation&nbsp;

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:51.840
between Caleb and Ava.

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:56.160
Arthur knows about the plan Caleb had made
the other night. But he isn't angry at all.

00:09:56.160 --> 00:10:01.200
In fact, Arthur thanks Caleb. Because of Caleb,
Ava was truly becoming as close to humans

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:02.160
as possible.

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:06.720
Arthur also tells Caleb that Ava doesn't love
him. She was just trying to use him to get

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:10.000
out of there. Ava was just using her brain
to survive.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.920
Arthur had brought Caleb so that he could
see how Ava would use him to get out of there.

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:18.240
It was because of the conversations Caleb
had with Ava, Arthur's robot was finally working

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:19.520
the way he had hoped.

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:24.120
Hearing all of this, Caleb gets sad. He feels
that he was used by Arthur just to see if

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:25.680
Ava would use him to escape.

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:28.560
Then the light is gone which had been switched
off by Ava.

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:33.040
Then Arthur says "Oh! She has switched off
the lights, just according to your plan. But

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:35.920
it is good that you did not alter the system
of security".

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:39.920
Caleb then reveals that he had already altered
the security system yesterday, when Arthur

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:40.720
was drunk.

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:45.120
Lights come back and Arthur notices that Ava
is out of her locked room. Arthur gets mad

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:47.120
and punches Caleb who gets knocked out.

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:51.840
Meanwhile, Ava meets the other robot that
was used by Arthur. Ava tells her about the

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:52.480
plan.

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:56.800
Arthur reaches there and orders Ava to go
back to her room. She asks Arthur, if she

00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:01.600
goes back to her room, will he ever let her
out. Arthur replies "Yes". But Ava knows that

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:02.480
he is lying.

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:07.360
She charges towards Arthur and pins him down.
But Arthur is clearly stronger than her. He

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:12.000
cuts down one of her hands and starts dragging
her. But the other robot puts a knife on Arthur's

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.640
back. Arthur is hurt and he destroys her.

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:18.240
Ava is back on her feet and she too uses the
knife to kill Arthur.

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:22.960
Ava moves to a another room. She changes her
hand from another robot. She puts new layer

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:25.600
of skin on her body and puts on a new dress.

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:29.680
Ava is completely changed. She was no longer
looking like a robot.

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:34.240
Caleb wants to get out of there with her.
But Ava has locked the door. Caleb begs her

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:37.600
to let him out. But Ava doesn't care about
him and leaves from there.

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:41.600
Ava looked like a human, but she clearly lacked
the feeling that weren't fitted on her.

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:45.120
She was just focused on the tasks which have
been fixed in her system.

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:49.760
She lacked of sympathy for humans. Caleb,
a human, is now locked inside a room.

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:54.800
Ava finally gets out of the house. She is
excited to see the world outside of her room.

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:55.920
She feels alive.

00:11:55.920 --> 00:12:00.160
The helicopter arrives to pick up Caleb, but
its Ava who gets on it and leaves from the

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:00.800
place.

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:03.680
Ava is now among humans and will live a life
of a human.

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:07.760
But on the other hand, Caleb is stuck in that
room, because he trusted a robot.

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:12.080
Will he ever be able to leave that house like
Ava. That is a question we all are left with

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:13.440
at the end of the movie.

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:17.840
So, what do you guys think of this movie.
Can a robot be exactly like a human and should

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:20.720
we humans fear of what kind of robot we are
making.

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:22.080
Comment down below.

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:23.840
And thanks for watching.
