00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:02.910
Hello everyone, this is Mr. Brain Junkie here!

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:07.040
And today we'll be talking about an action
comedy film called Kung Fu Hustle!

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.940
Be ready for some spoilers ahead!

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:14.340
Somewhere in a police station of Shanghai,
a local mafia boss is beating up the police

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.890
officers for arresting his beautiful wife,
while no one dares to retaliate.

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.859
He leaves the building while shouting at the
officers and walks towards the streets, but

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.089
quickly notices something wrong as all their
cars are missing.

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:30.519
An army of rival gangsters from the axe gang
appears in front of the group, surrounding

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:32.950
the men, leaving them no where to run.

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:37.190
The gangsters begin shooting their rivals,
while the mafia boss tries to run away,

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.700
but one of the generals throws an axe at the
running man and cuts off one of his legs,

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.420
causing him to fall to the ground.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.010
The axe gang leader, Brother Sum, takes a
weapon and begins dancing horrifically towards

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.810
the mafia boss, ignoring the man's plead for
mercy while striking him repeatedly.

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:57.020
It turns out that the gangsters paid the officers
a lot of money to not interfere,

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.060
and they continue to terrorize the town with
their horrendous dances, killing everyone

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:02.210
that stood in their way.

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.910
In theses chaotic times where the gangsters
rule over the people, only a poor town like

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:11.930
the pigsty valley can live peacefully, as
the gangs have no interest in their poverty.

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.800
The entire place is owned by a landlord that
seems to be drunk all the time,

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.060
and terrorizes the people by flirting with
them, regardless if the person is a middle

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.790
aged man or this unique looking woman with
extraordinary teeth.

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.380
The truth is that no one can escape from his
masculine charm, except for his wife, the

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.310
landlady, who appears to be angry all the
time.

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.320
Her hobby includes shouting at the tenants
for their late payments and knocking out their

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.690
most handsome man in the village.

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.830
Somewhere in the outskirts of the village,
two mysterious men look upon the people and

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.100
plans to unleash their evil schemes.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.320
They go into the town and begins to blackmails
the handsome man for money, claiming that

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.800
they are from the axe gang.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.130
However, their threats are not met with any
fear, as the villagers begin to surround the

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.280
place in hostility.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.450
Realizing that he probably chose the wrong
town to terrorize, the skinny man, Sing, tries

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.790
to run away, but gets stopped Immediately
by the landlady.

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.950
The women proceeds to hit him furiously with
a slipper, causing the man to run in fear.

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.519
Sing threatens to call for backup and throws
a firecracker behind the walls, hitting someone

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:15.030
as a result.

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.069
Surprisingly, he actually alerted the general
from the axe gang by blowing up the man's

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:20.069
hat,

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:23.700
and the gangsters walk into the town with
anger, demanding to know who was throwing

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:24.700
the bombs.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.349
Sing tells the man that it was one of the
people inside, and the general proceeds to

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:30.120
walk towards the landlady.

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.299
The woman senses trouble and runs away in
blinding speed, leaving all her tenant to

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:35.669
fend for themselves.

00:02:35.669 --> 00:02:39.870
The situation is made worse when the handsome
man tells the gang leader that he's not afraid

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.739
of their threats, causing the general to walk
forward, planning to strike him with the axe.

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:49.680
However, the man is attacked by a mysterious
force and knocked inside a barrel, breaking

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.580
his spine and forcing the gang to call for
backup.

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:58.040
Soon, an army of gangsters arrive inside the
Pigsty valley, and begins terrorizing everyone

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.359
who stands in their way.

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:04.230
They take a young girl hostage and pours gasoline
over her body, demanding to know the person

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.650
responsible for killing the captain.

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.019
After not receiving any response, the gang
leader throws a lighter at the girl, but the

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:14.840
attempt was stopped by a young man who claims
to be the one responsible.

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.810
The gangsters charge at him in fury, but he
proceeds to counter using a barrage of kicks,

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.720
knocking the criminals onto the floor.

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.260
Suddenly, numerous men are knocked away by
a powerful punch, as the tailor appears from

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.099
the crowd as well, fighting the enemies in
order to help the young man.

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:34.129
The gang tries to fight back by grabbing their
guns, but before they can shoot, the weapons

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:36.930
are destroyed as they're sent flying towards
the walls.

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.430
The restaurant owner named Donut charges out
and begins attacking the gangsters using a

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.680
stick, breaking their weapons and sending
them flying backwards.

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.049
The man's furious attacks conjures a sandstorm,
where only agonizing screams of the criminals

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:50.189
can be heard.

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:54.659
When everything begins to settle, the gangsters
are all defeated on the ground as they desperately

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:56.280
try to get away from the town.

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.640
The gang leader is furious after what happened,
and blames Sing and his brother for causing

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.519
them great embarrassment, as the two are not
even part of the gang.

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:08.799
Sum tells his men to kill them, but when the
gangster throws the axe at the main character,

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:11.489
he manages to escape right before the weapon
hits.

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:15.219
The gang leader is impressed with the man's
skills and tells him to go kill one of the

00:04:15.219 --> 00:04:19.400
people from the Pigsty valley, if he ever
wants to join the axe gang.

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:24.550
After leaving the mafia's hideout, Sing lectures
his brother, Bone, about being ambitious,

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.930
and tells him that they'll have everything
if they can join the gangsters.

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:31.979
Bone questions how they can kill anyone from
the Pigsty valley, as they all seem to be

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:37.470
very powerful, but Sing reveals that he also
knows Kung Fu ever since he was a little boy.

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:41.900
Apparently, he used up all the money that
he saved to buy a book from a beggar who claims

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.889
that it'll give him great powers.

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:48.210
Instead of going to school and becoming a
doctor, Sing decided to practice Kung Fu as

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.620
he wanted to protect the world from evil.

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.750
One day, he sees a mute girl being bullied
by a group of young boys, and orders them

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:55.870
to stop.

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:00.050
Sing decides to help her by using his Kung
Fu, but quickly gets beat up and knocked to

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:01.050
the floor.

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:05.550
The boys embarrass him and laughs at his efforts
and leaves the two defeated on the ground.

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:10.020
Ever since that day, Sing decided that good
people can never win in this world, and swears

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.639
to be a bad person in order to succeed.

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:17.080
He sees an ice cream cart and runs towards
it, pretending to be a customer, but runs

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.460
away quickly after grabbing the cones,

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:23.509
leaving the girl to chase after them hopelessly
as Sing laughs at her efforts.

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:28.010
Meanwhile, Brother Sum has decided to hire
professional killers to take vengeance on

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:29.949
the people from the Pigsty valley.

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:34.080
The two men appears to be blind, but their
names are notorious in the criminal world

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.099
as they're known to kill their enemies using
their music.

00:05:37.099 --> 00:05:41.060
When the advisor flatters them by calling
the assassins the strongest killers, they

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:42.750
decline with humility,

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:46.729
claiming that another man known as the beast
is much more powerful, but currently locked

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:47.900
up in the asylum.

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:52.870
At night, one of the fighters decides to leave
the village to avoid anymore trouble, but

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:55.240
sees a musician playing his instrument.

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:59.660
The man begins walking away from the music
as objects behind him are cut into pieces

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:00.969
by the soundwaves.

00:06:00.969 --> 00:06:05.370
He quickly realizes that something is wrong,
but fails to react in time as the assasin

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:06.630
decapitates him.

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:11.120
At the same time, the tailor is ambushed by
the second musician and forced to fight back

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.680
as they exchange blows.

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:16.820
The two are equally matched in close combat,
and their struggle eventually causes them

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:20.840
to crash out from the buildings, where the
first musician is waiting for them.

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:24.819
The blind man starts attacking the tailor
using the soundwaves and sends him flying

00:06:24.819 --> 00:06:26.349
across the field.

00:06:26.349 --> 00:06:30.150
Before the man can be killed by the continuous
attacks, the restaurant owner shows up and

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:31.400
saves the tailor.

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:35.991
The fighter is able to counter the enemy's
attacks more efficiently using the spear,

00:06:35.991 --> 00:06:38.460
and he throws all the weapons towards the
assassins.

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:42.919
Donut flies towards the incoming waves as
he deflects the attacks, getting closer towards

00:06:42.919 --> 00:06:45.410
the opponents as the music intensifies.

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:49.550
The man is able to reach the musicians with
the last weapon, but hits a force field that

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:53.210
stops the attack, and gets knocked away by
the enemy's counter.

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:58.039
The musicians regain their position and continues
to fire without mercy, and the tailor pushes

00:06:58.039 --> 00:07:02.409
Donut away from danger, but fatally damaging
himself in the process.

00:07:02.409 --> 00:07:05.960
Before the the two are killed by the onslaught,
the waves are dispersed by the shouting of

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:07.080
the landlady.

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:10.870
The assassins realize that there's another
powerful entity here, and tries to pursue

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:14.770
the woman, but are stopped quickly by the
landlord who descents from the sky.

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:18.569
The assassins try to punch the man, but their
attacks bounce off from the landlord's body

00:07:18.569 --> 00:07:21.090
and causes them to hit each other instead.

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:25.650
The landlord grabs onto the two men and begins
throwing them in a circle, eventually tossing

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:27.340
them away like ragdolls.

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:31.720
The assassins recover and tries to use their
most powerful attack, turning the sound waves

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:34.590
into skeleton warriors that fly towards at
the man.

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:39.010
The landlady steps in and counters using her
shouting technique, scattering the demons

00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:41.870
into pieces and blasting the musicians away.

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:45.960
When the fight is over, The people in the
town tries to save the heroes, but two of

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:49.889
them died already, and Donut eventually succumbs
to his wounds as well.

00:07:49.889 --> 00:07:54.270
The next day, Sing tries to bully a passenger
on the train, but proceeds to get beat up

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:57.449
repeatedly and thrown off the vehicle like
a common beggar.

00:07:57.449 --> 00:08:01.669
He blame his brother for not being evil enough,
and complains that they haven't killed anyone

00:08:01.669 --> 00:08:05.979
after so many days, questioning how they can
join the gangsters like this.

00:08:05.979 --> 00:08:09.939
He sees the ice cream girl again and rushes
towards her, demanding that she give him all

00:08:09.939 --> 00:08:12.190
her money and throwing her on the ground.

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:16.800
Sing grabs the girl a second time and threatens
her with a knife, but only sees tears falling

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:17.800
from her eyes.

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:21.690
Bone manages to find the money inside the
cart, and they grabs the coins and prepare

00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:22.690
to run,

00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:26.990
but Sing notices the girl using sign language
to communicate with him and becomes aware

00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:28.650
of who she really is.

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:32.760
The girl shows Sing the lollipop from years
ago, and reveals that she was in fact the

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:36.100
mute girl who the main character tried to
save when they were Kids.

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:40.669
Upon realizing the truth, the man feels terrible,
and he smashes the lollipop onto the floor

00:08:40.669 --> 00:08:42.320
before running away.

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:46.600
Before Sing can reflect on his mistakes, he's
taken in by the gangsters and brought towards

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:51.029
brother Sum, who tells him that he's part
of the Gang now and gives him a new mission.

00:08:51.029 --> 00:08:55.260
The man is brought to a psychiatric hospital
and the advisors tells him to break out a

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.010
killer who's kept in the deepest part of the
building.

00:08:58.010 --> 00:09:02.410
Sing rushes towards the hospital and makes
it inside, eventually arriving underground

00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:04.380
where the hallway is filled with frogs.

00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:09.180
He picks the lock and opens the metal door,
only to see an old man sitting on the toilet.

00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:13.190
They bring back the person, and the gangsters
have trouble believing that this is the legendary

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:15.030
killer who's called the beast.

00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:19.070
The advisor explains that their leader wants
the man to kill two people, and are willing

00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:23.130
to pay anything, but doubts that the old man
is actually the right person.

00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:26.880
the Gangster pulls out a gun and points it
towards the man, but he quickly takes the

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:29.680
weapon away, and points it towards his own
head.

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:34.690
The man pulls the trigger and fires, but amazingly,
he's able to catch the bullet using only two

00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:37.590
fingers, while everyone watches in amazement.

00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:42.090
The beast turns towards the walls and stomps
on the floor using incredible power, blasting

00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:46.110
a giant hole through the room as everyone
in the casino run for their lives.

00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:50.420
The killer leaps forward and sees the opponents
waiting for him beside the table, who turns

00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:55.300
out to be the landlady and the landlord, coming
here to destroy the axe gang forever.

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:59.350
The couple shows the gangsters the funeral
bell that they brought as gift, causing brother

00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:01.470
Sum to scream at them with anger.

00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:05.670
The woman kicks the killer from below, splitting
the table in half, while her husband kicks

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:09.810
the man directly on the face, but they are
not able to move the beast at all.

00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:14.200
The two regroups and jumps towards the enemy,
attacking with their combined efforts, but

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:17.100
are quickly knocked back and sent flying into
the air.

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:21.440
The killer begins striking the husband using
incredible speed, while the man desperately

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:25.380
tries to evade the punches, but failing at
the last moment and gets knocked towards the

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:26.380
walls.

00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:30.710
The woman flies in begins using her shouting
technique, sending a shockwave that knock

00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:34.750
away everything, but only manages to push
the enemy backwards a little bit.

00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:38.980
The killer laughs at her efforts and proceeds
to attack the woman without mercy, sending

00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:40.160
her across the room.

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:44.750
Seeing that the opponent is vastly more powerful,
the landlady goes to the giant bell that they

00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:49.130
brought, and hits it on the top with immense
force, breaking open the giant metal.

00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:53.770
The woman turns the bell into a massive amplifier
and begins using her lion's roar, sending

00:10:53.770 --> 00:10:57.760
a massive shockwave towards the enemy as it
destroys everything in sight.

00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:01.830
The attack was so powerful that it sends the
beast flying backwards along side everything

00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:07.000
else, as it generates a tornado inside the
building that rips apart the entire room.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.150
Surprisingly, the killer was able to survive
as he crawls on the ground, but the couple

00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:13.990
jumps in and prepares to fire a second round.

00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:18.520
However, the enemy quickly admits defeat and
begs for mercy, but when the couple lowers

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:23.060
their guard, the man attack them using the
flower daggers and stabs them in the stomach.

00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:27.100
The three are quickly tangled up in a stalemate
as they struggle to attack the opponent's

00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:28.100
weak spots.

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:32.080
The gang leader sees this and immediately
tells Sing to strike the couple on the head

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:33.500
using a wooden bat.

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:37.610
The main character hesitates to attack but
eventually decides to hit the killer right

00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:42.040
on the head, causing the man to break free
in a surge of fury that throws the couple

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:43.040
away.

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:46.560
The killer throws the main character onto
the floor and punches the man's face with

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:48.920
anger, knocking his head into the ground.

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:53.650
However, the beast quickly notices something
wrong and sees that the couple has disappeared,

00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:56.519
and realizes that they took Sing with them
as well.

00:11:56.519 --> 00:12:00.670
The couple takes the man back to the Pigsty
valley and tries to help him by using medical

00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:01.750
herbs and bandages,

00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:07.120
but are surprised to see that Sing is somehow
still alive even after sustaining such damage.

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:10.850
They speculate that the only way the main
character is not dead, must be because the

00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:13.880
damages actually awakened the man's hidden
powers.

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:18.140
At the same time, the gangsters have arrived
at the Pigsty valley that's completely abandoned

00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:19.140
by the residents,

00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:23.630
and the beast finds the remains of bandages
where it looks like a giant cocoon has been

00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:24.630
hatched.

00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:27.830
The gangsters walk out from the buildings,
and the killer is surprised to see that Sing

00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:30.840
is still alive even after getting beat to
near death.

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:34.770
The mob charges at the main character and
tries to kill him using their weapons, but

00:12:34.770 --> 00:12:39.110
their attacks are quickly evaded as Sing knocks
them flying using little efforts.

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:42.810
He kicks the gangsters across the field as
they land onto the lower platform.

00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:47.160
The criminals try to surround the fighter
and attack him all together, but Sing demonstrates

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:50.720
superhuman abilities and proceeds to kick
the men through the buildings.

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:54.540
The gangsters try to escape and run towards
the beast, but they are defeated quickly one

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:58.520
by one, eventually only leaving Sing and the
killer still standing.

00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:02.420
The main character punches the enemy in the
face and kicks him in the stomach, causing

00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:04.970
the opponent to fly downwards onto the floor,

00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:08.920
but is surprised to see that the man is barely
damaged from the furious attacks.

00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:12.990
He then tries attacking the enemy using a
barrage of punches, but the strikes are quickly

00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:17.080
stopped by the opponent, as the old man is
able to catch the flying hands.

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:20.410
Sing steps on the man's feet, causing him
to scream in agony.

00:13:20.410 --> 00:13:24.120
He then proceeds with a devastating kick that
knocks the man onto the ground and punches

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:25.580
him across the field.

00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:29.420
The killer decides to switch techniques and
begins imitating a frog as he lays on the

00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:30.420
ground.

00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:34.120
The man launches towards Sing with incredible
speed and knocks him through the building,

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:35.370
crashing into the walls.

00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:39.240
The hero tries to run towards higher grounds
as he leaps across the floors, but the beast

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:43.250
locks onto his movements and launches at the
man, sending him into the sky.

00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:46.880
The attack was so powerful that Sing disappeared
into the atmospheres.

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:51.270
The man continues flying outwards, but eventually
slows down as he regains control over his

00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:56.180
momentum and looks upon the sky, where he
sees a giant Buddha formed by the clouds.

00:13:56.180 --> 00:14:00.560
Sing closes the palms and begins flying downwards,
picking up incredible speed as he charges

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:01.750
towards the beast.

00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:06.380
The man's palms begin to catch on fire, and
the flames quickly engulf his entire body.

00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:10.630
The killer feels something wrong as he senses
the immense pressure coming from the sky,

00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:13.760
and sees what appears to be a meteorite falling
towards him.

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:18.260
Sing uses the Buddhist palm technique, which
makes a gigantic crater under the opponent,

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:20.560
crushing him with enormous gravity from above.

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:24.600
The beast quickly begs for mercy and Sing
pulls back the attack while flying across

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:25.600
the sky.

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:29.930
Just like before, the killer tries to ambush
the main character using the same dagger,

00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:33.960
but Sing quickly counters and strikes right
behind the man, breaking apart the entire

00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:35.810
building in the process.

00:14:35.810 --> 00:14:39.780
After seeing the incredible power difference
between the two, the killer surrenders and

00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:43.840
kneels before Sing, finally admitting defeat
like never before.

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:47.990
sometimes later, the ice cream girl pushes
her cart across the street, and sees a newly

00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:49.920
opened candy shop in the city.

00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:54.190
She goes to the front and sees that Bone is
now working as the assistance for the store.

00:14:54.190 --> 00:14:58.560
Sing notices the girl right away and quickly
goes towards her while smiling at his friend.

00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:02.970
The girl returns the warmness as she sees
that Sing has finally become his true self.

00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:07.050
They begin remembering how they were when
they saw each other for the first time, and

00:15:07.050 --> 00:15:11.730
Sing welcomes the girl into the store with
happiness.

00:15:11.730 --> 00:15:13.560
