Hi, Israq21 here,

00:00:02.005 --> 00:00:05.558
Today, I will recap a movie called Cruel Intention

00:00:05.558 --> 00:00:12.542
Cruel Intentions is a 1999 American teen romantic drama film about a rich boy who is obsessed with his step sister.

00:00:12.542 --> 00:00:16.693
This boy really wanted to make love with his step sister so they made a bet.

00:00:16.693 --> 00:00:19.435
If he wins, he could make love with her.

00:00:19.435 --> 00:00:23.602
OK, what's the continuation of the story?
watch out and take care,

00:00:23.602 --> 00:00:28.255
This is a spoiler content video, Enjoy the video and let’s start the story,

00:00:32.194 --> 00:00:39.895
The film begins with a rich high school boy named Sebastian,
who is undergoing psychological therapy for being too sexually addicted,

00:00:39.895 --> 00:00:44.335
instead of therapy, sebastian even aroused by his psychologist.

00:00:44.335 --> 00:00:50.810
after sebastian left, suddenly this psychologist's daughter called and said that her nude photos were spread on the internet,

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.471
and it turned out that the one who spread the photo was Sebastian.

00:00:54.471 --> 00:01:00.037
The psychologist went after Sebastian, but Sebastian had left with a girl he just met,

00:01:00.037 --> 00:01:02.875
amazing, he's the king of crap.

00:01:02.875 --> 00:01:07.506
Next, we are introduced to Kathryn, Sebastian's stepsister,

00:01:07.506 --> 00:01:11.568
Kathryn is labeled as a good child and a role model at school,

00:01:11.568 --> 00:01:16.565
so Cecile and her mother came, who asked for tips and tricks on how to be a good child.

00:01:16.565 --> 00:01:21.699
Suddenly, Sebastian came and greeted Cecile's mother by shouting in her ear,

00:01:21.699 --> 00:01:26.752
because they felt uncomfortable with Sebastian who had been labeled a Bad Boy and heathenish,

00:01:26.752 --> 00:01:30.370
Cecile and her mother finally left the house.

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:35.166
After that, it is seen that Kathryn is also a bad girl like sebastian,

00:01:35.166 --> 00:01:43.794
Kathryn also said that she really hates Cecile because Kathryn's boyfriend cheated on Cecile, so Kathryn wants to take revenge on Cecile.

00:01:43.794 --> 00:01:49.385
She ordered Sebastian to sleep with Cecile so that Cecile was labeled bad girl by people.

00:01:49.385 --> 00:01:53.410
but Sebastian refused and said he didn't want to make love with Cecile,

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:58.143
Because getting Cecile is really easy, too easy,
I need a challenging one.

00:01:58.143 --> 00:02:02.177
Sebastian also looked at a magazine that had a photo of a girl named Annette,

00:02:02.177 --> 00:02:09.050
she was known as a smart girl, diligent in worship,
the daughter of the principal and did not want to make love before marriage.

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:15.146
so Sebastian also feels more satisfied if he can make love with Annette because it can increase the level of his fame.

00:02:15.146 --> 00:02:17.926
Hearing that Kathryn even doubted Sebastian,

00:02:17.926 --> 00:02:22.471
so Sebastian feels even more challenged and invites Kathryn to make a bet,

00:02:22.471 --> 00:02:28.708
where if Sebastian fails to make love with annet,
then Sebastian's favorite luxury car will belong to Kathryn,

00:02:28.708 --> 00:02:37.679
but if Sebastian succeeds in making love with annette,
Sebastian also could make love with his stepsister and even better Sebastian can stab her anywhere.

00:02:37.679 --> 00:02:43.694
Then Sebastian goes to his aunt's house,
it turned out that his aunt was the arrival of the guest, Annette,

00:02:43.694 --> 00:02:46.698
His aunt said, Annette would take it here for a week.

00:02:46.698 --> 00:02:50.698
Sebastian was really happy and immediately began to tempt Annette,

00:02:50.698 --> 00:02:54.921
But apparently Annette knew the Sebastian reputation known as A Bad Boy.

00:02:54.921 --> 00:03:00.511
Feeling rejected, Sebastian is increasingly challenged by Annette's cold attitude.

00:03:00.511 --> 00:03:03.814
He is also curious who has revealed his secret.

00:03:03.814 --> 00:03:08.569
On the other hand, Cecile was studying music with his teacher named Ronald,

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:12.810
Instead of teaching,  Ronald was actually aroused with Cecile,

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.218
suddenly Kathryn came and Ronald was shocked then he left the place.

00:03:17.218 --> 00:03:21.626
Then it looks Sebastian comes to his gay friend and asks who has spread his secret,

00:03:21.626 --> 00:03:25.245
His friend also suspected Greg, Annette's best friend,

00:03:25.245 --> 00:03:29.638
But it turned out that it wasn't Greg that spread Sebastian's secrets.

00:03:29.638 --> 00:03:32.346
After Sebastian threatened Greg to find out,

00:03:32.346 --> 00:03:36.297
Finally we know that what leaked his secret was Cecile’s Mother.

00:03:36.297 --> 00:03:44.488
On the other hand, Kathryn is relaxing with Cecile and from here Kathryn knows that Cecile also likes her music teacher, Ronald.

00:03:44.488 --> 00:03:49.865
When at home, Sebastian was very emotional because it was upset with Cecile’s Mother.

00:03:49.865 --> 00:03:53.870
finally He’s working with Kathryn to drop Cecile and his mother.

00:03:53.870 --> 00:04:01.151
The next day, Sebastian and Kathryn run his mission by reporting to Cecile’s Mother about Ronald's love story and Cecile,

00:04:01.151 --> 00:04:04.895
Cecile’s Mother was angry and immediately drove Ronald.

00:04:04.895 --> 00:04:10.732
When in the elevator, Ronald met Sebastian and Kathryn who gave him that Cecile also loved him,

00:04:10.732 --> 00:04:17.037
Ronald was told to make a reply letter his love for Cecile,
then Sebastian brought the letter to Cecile

00:04:17.037 --> 00:04:21.194
But here Sebastian is even aroused and intends to screwing Cecile,

00:04:21.194 --> 00:04:25.888
Sebastian immediately kisses Cecile but it's not her mouth lip, but lip under the stomach.

00:04:25.888 --> 00:04:30.916
The next day, their aunt told Sebastian and Annette to go to the nursing home.

00:04:30.916 --> 00:04:38.451
After returning from the nursing home,
Annette knew that Sebastian was very bored there so she entertained Sebastian all the way home.

00:04:38.451 --> 00:04:42.032
Entertainment from Annentte can make Sebastian laugh,

00:04:42.032 --> 00:04:46.144
And this is where they feel love for the first time.

00:04:46.144 --> 00:04:53.241
On the other hand, Cecile tells the story that last night Sebastian wrote letters with his tongue until he felt like exploding.

00:04:53.241 --> 00:04:56.848
But Kathryn instead said that the thing that Cecile did was correct,

00:04:56.848 --> 00:04:59.254
and it would make Cecile to be a real woman.

00:04:59.254 --> 00:05:02.694
Kathryn also told Cecile to practice sleeping with Sebastian,

00:05:02.694 --> 00:05:08.116
so that later it didn't make Ronald disappointed when making love with her.

00:05:08.116 --> 00:05:14.180
The next day, Sebastian was observing Annette,
Kathryn came and reminded him of the bet they did.

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:19.201
Hearing that, Sebastian convinced Kathryn that he would not lose,

00:05:19.201 --> 00:05:25.668
then Sebastian approached Annette and immediately kissed her, apparently Annette also wanted to be kissed by Sebastian.

00:05:25.668 --> 00:05:31.195
But suddenly Annette changed his mind and immediately pushed Sebastian so that they is being fighting.

00:05:31.195 --> 00:05:36.240
At night, Sebastian began to give up get annette so he wanted to say goodbye away.

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.889
But suddenly Annette instead locked the door,

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:44.836
then opened her clothes, and then told Sebastian to make love with her.

00:05:44.836 --> 00:05:47.766
But whatever change Sebastian's mind,

00:05:47.766 --> 00:05:51.287
he instead run away because he could not sleep with Annette.

00:05:51.287 --> 00:05:56.713
The next day, Annette turned out to have left her aunt's house to move to her friend's house.

00:05:56.713 --> 00:05:59.701
after finding out the existence of annette from Greg.

00:05:59.701 --> 00:06:03.438
finally Sebastian knew Annette was still at the station.

00:06:03.438 --> 00:06:08.755
Then he followed her and told Annette that actually he had fallen in love for the first time with Annette,

00:06:08.755 --> 00:06:11.607
and it turned out that Annette also fell in love with him.

00:06:11.607 --> 00:06:15.640
and finally they are making love and this is the first time for Annette,

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:18.092
so Sebastian has won the stakes.

00:06:18.092 --> 00:06:23.621
Then Sebastian returned home, Sebastian wants to ask the bet to make love with his step sister.

00:06:23.621 --> 00:06:28.317
but Sebastian instead heard the sound of making love from Kathryn's room.

00:06:28.317 --> 00:06:32.077
After entering the room, it turned out that Kathryn is only alone,

00:06:32.077 --> 00:06:37.937
but when the drawer bottom of the bed was opened it,
there was a Ronald who has just finished making love with Kathryn.

00:06:37.937 --> 00:06:40.959
So Ronald came out of there because he was embarrassed.

00:06:40.959 --> 00:06:45.726
Kathryn was still not satisfied here,
so he told Sebastian to make love with her,

00:06:45.726 --> 00:06:50.031
but now Sebastian is feeling disgusted with Kathryn so he left her,

00:06:50.031 --> 00:06:53.247
so Kathryn became really angry.

00:06:53.247 --> 00:06:56.850
Kathryn continued to try asking for Making Love with Sebastian,

00:06:56.850 --> 00:07:00.297
but Kathryn saw Sebastian who was calling intently with Annette.

00:07:00.297 --> 00:07:06.429
Kathryn who saw it was upset, so she said that the reputation of Sebastian would be destroyed if he was dating annette.

00:07:06.429 --> 00:07:09.616
Kathryn also threatened to tell Annette about the stakes.

00:07:09.616 --> 00:07:13.796
Hearing the threat of Kathryn,
Sebastian chose to tell Annette himself,

00:07:13.796 --> 00:07:18.594
he said that he never loved her and did everything just because of a bet that he had to make love with her.

00:07:18.594 --> 00:07:21.642
Annette felt hurt and drove out Sebastian.

00:07:22.067 --> 00:07:30.781
Sebastian returned to his house and met Kathryn, he said that he had broken up with Annette so it was time for Kathryn to make love with Sebastian.

00:07:30.781 --> 00:07:36.398
But it turned out that Kathryn did not want to do it because since the beginning Kathryn had planned all this,

00:07:36.398 --> 00:07:45.405
he used Sebastian to screw Cecile, not only sebastian,
even Ronald, Cecile, Cecile’s Mother, was only considered as toys by Kathryn

00:07:45.405 --> 00:07:52.670
Kathryn also said that Sebastian was very stupid because he left his first love just because he was afraid of losing his reputation.

00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:56.582
Then Sebastian went to meet Annette,
but she did not want to meet him.

00:07:56.582 --> 00:08:02.248
So Sebastian gave him a letter and his diary containing all the girls who had been making love with him.

00:08:02.248 --> 00:08:08.129
The next day, Kathryn call Ronald by the phone and said that Sebastian had sleep together with Cecile,

00:08:08.129 --> 00:08:11.350
Ronald was really angry and went looking for Sebastian.

00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:14.915
Finally Ronald managed to find Sebastian and immediately beat him.

00:08:14.915 --> 00:08:20.390
It turned out that Annette also followed Sebastian,
so she was about to separate the fight.

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:25.327
But bad luck, Annette was even thrown into the middle of the road and almost hit by a car,

00:08:25.327 --> 00:08:28.772
Sebastian who saw it immediately pushed Annette,

00:08:28.772 --> 00:08:32.243
finally Sebastian was hit by a car and now he is dying,

00:08:32.243 --> 00:08:36.986
before Sebastian died he had time to say that he does love Annette.

00:08:36.986 --> 00:08:41.930
On the first day of school, all students commemorate Sebastian's death.

00:08:41.930 --> 00:08:46.922
Kathryn made a speech here as Chair of the Student Council and Sebastian's step sister,

00:08:46.922 --> 00:08:51.810
suddenly a student came and distributed a book that made one by one students out of there.

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:55.476
Kathryn was upset and curious,
so she also comes out.

00:08:55.476 --> 00:09:02.836
It turns out that everyone is reading a Sebastian’s diary containing all the secrets and crime of Kathryn so far,

00:09:02.836 --> 00:09:07.269
When the principal opened the necklace it turned out that the contents are drugs,

00:09:07.269 --> 00:09:12.655
Instantly the reputation of Kathryn as an example student was destroyed without remaining

00:09:12.655 --> 00:09:18.313
At the end of the film, We've seen Annette, who was relieved and happy because he had been with Sebastian.

00:09:18.313 --> 00:09:20.371
and the movie of cruel intention is,

00:09:20.371 --> 00:09:21.681
