00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:05.729
If a billionaire techy abducted &amp; forced you
to help his A.I. learn how to solve puzzles,

00:00:05.729 --> 00:00:06.999
what would you do

00:00:06.999 --> 00:00:11.080
In this How to Beat video, we’ll follow
the characters, see if we can make better

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.990
decisions, and ultimately attempt to beat
the ABDUCTOR’s A.I. in, TAU.

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.619
If you think you have a better way, let me
know in the comments!

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:21.779

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.720
We start out following Maika Monroe, who doesn’t
seem to have recovered well from her traumatic

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.949
teenage years.

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:40.180
She’s club hopping to pickpocket intoxicated
strangers for a living.

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.620
I’ll give her some credit for wearing disguises
so people can’t identify her once the deed

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:45.640
is done.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.360
I’m not sure why she’s getting busy with
her victims.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.440
I know it’s for a distraction, but you’re
in a club where people are drunk and drugged

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.440
up.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.850
You could probably pickpocket them without
swapping spit.

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:57.980
Julia’s also working alone.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.030
Pickpockets usually operate in pairs or teams
because it’s safer and more lucrative.

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.830
Despite her disguises, it looks like her misdeeds
have caught up to her.

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.270
She’s wearing disguises so people she just
pickpocketed can’t identify her, but she

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.250
never changes the disguise in the club or
when she’s walking home.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.830
Ideally, you’d want to include layers of
dresses you can swap out of or into, a light

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.260
jacket you could throw on over your dress,
different wigs, basically anything you can

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.590
use to quickly change your overall appearance
in between pickpocket victims.

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:33.210
The CIA calls these quick-changes, which they
use to shake tails or surveillance.

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.830
I wouldn’t want to be walking through these
alleys by myself at night, and I'm not an

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.590
attractive woman stealing shit from drunk
guys.

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.619
Julia seems way too nonchalant about it too.

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:47.170
Maybe I’m an overly paranoid person, but
when I walk out to my car at night I'm constantly

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:48.740
looking over my shoulder.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.340
Then again, I also can’t use the toilet
in a bathroom without first checking behind

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.500
the shower curtains, so I probably do have
unresolved issues.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.450
Julia sells the stolen goods off to her pawn
pimp

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:06.420
Good to see the pawn pimp and I are in agreement.

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.210
How many dark alleys does she have to walk
through to get home, Jesus.

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:14.880
There’s literally starving, desperate homeless
people huddling around trash can bonfires.

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.880
I’m not saying homeless people are bad,
I’m saying that walking through an area

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.331
of peak desperation like you’re a runway
model, might not be a good idea, and if any

00:02:23.331 --> 00:02:26.400
pissed off drunk dudes followed you, you’re
screwed.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.400
Oh.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.090
That’s where she lives.

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.080
She slips into something more comfortable
and drops her hard earned cash into an ice

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.890
cream carton that she keeps in the fridge?

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.120
I Googled this, and it turns out it’s actually
a viable method that people use.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:45.390
I know you don’t have a bank account or
a SentrySafe, but I bet some of those floorboards

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.000
are loose, just store your cash there, or
in a ceiling tile which requires a ladder

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000
to get to.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.180
Both are probably safer than the fridge if
a dopehead breaks in.

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.540
While Julia’s doing the dishes, her stalker
picks the lock.

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.910
I know I’m supposed to be helping Julia
here, but I think the stalker could do better.

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.160
If I was trying to abduct Julia, I wouldn't
wait for her to come home before trying to

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.160
break in.

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.830
You don’t know if she’s in the shower,
doing dishes, or if she’s sitting on the

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:25.800
sofa within arms reach of a gun waiting to
blast you as you waltz in.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.900
This is clearly premeditated and he’s probably
already staked her out.

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.260
He knows what she does, when she leaves, and
when she comes home, and that she always comes

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.390
home alone.

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:39.819
Just wait until she leaves to go pickpocket
people, then break into her home and wait

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:41.140
for her to come back.

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.910
He gets lucky and ninja’s into her living
room while she is distracted doing dishes.

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.410
Once she finishes cleaning the dishes, she
hears the wood floor in her living room creak

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.040
as if someone tiptoed across it.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:59.050
Come on, at least grab a knife or something
before you confront whatever’s making weird

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:00.739
noises in your living room.

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:05.269
This is also another prime time to slice the
pie, ensuring the corners of the room are

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:09.550
clear first, before proceeding further into
the room.

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:15.909
Whaddya know, her stalker jumps out from the
corner of the room and tranqs her with a needle

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:17.190
to the neck.

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.910
Using a tranq needle or dart is unreliable
and unnecessary.

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.200
If you get the dose wrong, you could either
kill her or the tranq will take too long to

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.200
take effect.

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.970
The real issue is if you don’t get a clean
stick into her jugular because she’s moving

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:30.970
and squirming.

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.460
If you miss, it could take minutes for the
substance to take effect.

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.170
You might be thinking that chloroform seemed
to have worked well on Maika before..

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:39.990
..But that’s just Hollywood.

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:43.940
It actually takes a few minutes of inhalation
to render someone unconscious.

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.571
If you do have the opportunity to stick her
in the jugular or, you might as well just

00:04:47.571 --> 00:04:52.560
apply a blood choke which will knock her out
in 10 or so seconds, then administer the tranquilizer.

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.650
Personally, I think he should’ve used a
sliding door van to do a snatch and grab while

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:58.430
she’s coming back from the pawn shop.

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:02.440
Since she’s going through security to get
into clubs, it’s highly unlikely that she

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.340
has a weapon in her little purse.

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:08.550
It’s isolated, unlike the apartment where
if she screams you might have other people

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:12.900
to contend with, your getaway is quick, and
you don’t have to worry about being identified

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:17.200
while bumping your heavy luggage bag down
every stair step of that ghetto apartment.

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.220
I promise I'm a good person in real life guys.

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:24.660
The abductor does just fine without our help,
and Julia wakes up strapped to a chair in

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:28.330
a cyber lab with surgical tools on a tray
next to her.

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.259
Sorry Julia, but you pickpocketed the wrong
dude.

00:05:31.259 --> 00:05:40.820
For her sake, I just hope Gerald Butler doesn’t
walk in.

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:45.389
She gets some kind of Total Recall treatment,
which shocks her brain unconscious.

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:49.970
Julia wakes up in an electrified cage with
two other unlucky victims, and they both have

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:52.890
glowing implants in their necks/spines too.

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:57.220
Her captor arrives and herds her through his
overcomplicated prison where he straps her

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:02.130
down, jacks her into his software program
like in the Matrix, and collects all her neural

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:05.570
impulses and memories for his secret project.

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:10.229
Alex should really be using a VPN to secure
his internet traffic so his secret project

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:11.250
isn’t exposed.

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:13.990
Today’s video is being brought to you by
NordVPN.

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:18.570
Now, since you watch my videos, you know that
there’s a lot of bad stuff doing bad things

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:19.630
to good people.

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:24.150
You also know that we figure out how to beat
the bad stuff, well, most of the time.

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:27.810
That’s where NordVPN comes in, let me explain
how they help.

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:33.280
If body snatchers or other unscrupulous actors
are censoring the internet in your region,

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:39.140
NordVPN enables you to bypass them and access
content wherever and whenever, securely, and

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:40.140
anonymously.

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:45.680
Now, if the pod people are banning VPNs, well,
NordVPN has stealth capabilities, so you can

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.660
even use it even in areas where VPNs are banned.

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:53.930
If a computer witch is intercepting your internet
traffic and hacking you, NordVPN will encrypt

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:59.050
your data, making it impossible for the Ma
Rinas of the world to steal your passwords,

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:03.090
credit cards, important secrets, and wreak
havoc on your life.

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:08.790
Maybe you aren’t under attack by aliens
or the supernatural, why would you need NordVPN?

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:12.180
Since you’re here, you probably like movies
and TV series.

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:18.199
Well, NordVPN enables you to access geo-restricted
content from Netflix, Amazon Prime, and other

00:07:18.199 --> 00:07:19.949
streaming sites.

00:07:19.949 --> 00:07:23.690
So if you want to beat the people that are
attacking your internet freedom, and help

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:28.550

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:37.800
Thanks so much again to NordVPN for sponsoring
and powering this video.

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:43.680
He finishes collecting her brain data, and
on her way back to her cell, she swipes a

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:44.680
scalpel.

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:46.240
Huge mistake on the captors part.

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:50.889
You don’t allow prisoners to be unshackled
around sharp objects or weapons, nor should

00:07:50.889 --> 00:07:55.310
you be moving prisoners past potential weapons
on their way back to their cell.

00:07:55.310 --> 00:08:00.349
And you especially don’t do this, if one
of your prisoners is a professional pickpocketer.

00:08:00.349 --> 00:08:04.990
Julia uses the scissors and cloth from her
uniform to create a little grappling hook,

00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:10.580
and slings it over to the power box, decoupling
the gas line and then causes another spark,

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:16.250
exploding the joint.

00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:19.530
That throw is pretty clutch, Julia is killing
it right now.

00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:23.990
My problem is why doesn't the captor have
cameras or robo-guards in this room?

00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:28.580
The explosion conveniently breaks a human-sized
hole in the prison bars, and they make their

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:29.620
escape.

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:34.489
Respect for grabbing weapons too, most protagonists
would’ve just ran off empty handed.

00:08:34.489 --> 00:08:37.979
Too bad the other two abductees are expendable
meat bags.

00:08:37.979 --> 00:08:41.680
They reach the front door, but the door is
locked with a hand sensor.

00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:45.309
Julia warns him not to place his hand on it,
and for a good reason.

00:08:45.309 --> 00:08:49.769
Why in the sweet hell would it work, you’re
just going to trigger the alarm system.

00:08:49.769 --> 00:08:54.059
The sole purpose of the hand sensor is to
alert security due to a mismatch.

00:08:54.059 --> 00:08:57.540
If you can’t find a way out of the home,
it’s better to ambush the man when he comes

00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:00.630
back instead of setting off the alarm system.

00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:05.370
I guess I understand that you’d be hasty,
irrational, and likely to palm it given the

00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:08.149
situation, which the other prisoner does.

00:09:08.149 --> 00:09:13.700
The alarm system just so happens to be a robocop
enforcement droid, which slices and dices

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:17.920
Julias accomplices.

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:22.800
Jesus who is this guy.

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:27.100
And why was the robot AI activated when the
handprint sensor failed, but not when the

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:28.699
home fucking exploded.

00:09:28.699 --> 00:09:33.939
Whoever this captor is, he’s got dough,
imagination, and intelligence, but lacks basic

00:09:33.939 --> 00:09:35.220
common sense.

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:40.050
Julia makes a break for it, but the machine
grabs her just as the captor, Alex, returns

00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:41.050
home.

00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:44.440
He ties her up and goes to inspect the damage,
which is catastrophic.

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:49.110
Did this chick really implant a metal pipe
into a concrete wall, holy shit Maika went

00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:50.269
beast mode.

00:09:50.269 --> 00:09:56.910
Just as he’s about to implant the metal
pipe in her face, Tau activates ‘Zen Mode’

00:09:56.910 --> 00:10:03.069
to calm him down.

00:10:03.069 --> 00:10:07.600
Instead of hiring a mechanic or electrician,
he mobilizes cute little mini robot drones

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:10.209
to help clean up the bodies, blood, and damage.

00:10:10.209 --> 00:10:12.019
The robocop joins in too.

00:10:12.019 --> 00:10:16.649
That floor is really nice, and you just have
a huge robot with metal feet stomping around

00:10:16.649 --> 00:10:18.059
and scratching it?

00:10:18.059 --> 00:10:20.779
Put some rubber guards on its feet at least.

00:10:20.779 --> 00:10:25.689
Just before Alex leaves, he tells Julia that
if she tries anything again, Tau will kill

00:10:25.689 --> 00:10:26.689
her.

00:10:26.689 --> 00:10:28.009
Seems she’s in a bit of a pickle.

00:10:28.009 --> 00:10:32.069
The drones finish cleaning up, and put on
the final touches, like adjusting a picture

00:10:32.069 --> 00:10:37.610
of Alex with his quote saying, “why is everyone
so scared of artificial intelligence.”

00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:48.279
When Alex gets back, Tau briefs him on the
progress.

00:10:48.279 --> 00:11:01.179
Good god where can I get one of these robot
AI’s.

00:11:01.179 --> 00:11:08.230
Tau also informs Alex that he needs to attend
a video conference in a few minutes.

00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:12.489
I know you’re mad and just being dramatic,
but instructions like that could end up badly

00:11:12.489 --> 00:11:15.079
if the AI misinterpreted your meaning.

00:11:15.079 --> 00:11:18.970
Sarcasm is notoriously difficult for AI programs
to learn.

00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:23.779
If you didn’t program it’s language processing
to understand idioms, an AI like this could

00:11:23.779 --> 00:11:27.399
take it literally, and you’d be coming home
to a very tongueless Julia.

00:11:27.399 --> 00:11:32.239
Do you really want to stumble into your living
room and see a robot holding Julia’s detached

00:11:32.239 --> 00:11:36.769
tongue with her moaning in agony in a pool
of blood before you hop on call with Bill

00:11:36.769 --> 00:11:37.769
Gates?

00:11:37.769 --> 00:11:38.999
It’s just bad for business.

00:11:38.999 --> 00:11:43.170
And if you’re really concerned with her
yelling for help, just gag her instead.

00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:47.750
Julia’s just chilling by the statue, while
Alex is lambasted on his video conference

00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:56.209
by the other board members.

00:11:56.209 --> 00:11:59.629
She can overhear them talking so it’s likely
they could hear her.

00:11:59.629 --> 00:12:04.489
I’d take the chance that the AI understood
idioms, considering it knew how to decant

00:12:04.489 --> 00:12:07.639
the Chateau de Sancerre Rouge, and yell for
help.

00:12:07.639 --> 00:12:11.329
Who knows if they’d help her, but they don’t
seem to appreciate Alex much at this point.

00:12:11.329 --> 00:12:16.160
It’s worth a shot, as there’s no way this
guy is letting you leave this place alive.

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:21.299
Julia hesitates, and Alex ends the call to
go eat at a table that strangely has a second

00:12:21.299 --> 00:12:22.299
seat.

00:12:22.299 --> 00:12:25.750
It doesn’t seem like this guy has a wife
or partner, so it could indicate he has some

00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:28.310
emotional issues with being alone.

00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:29.470
Could be worth playing on.

00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:34.139
If Alex did suffer from loneliness, he should
have made some robot companions like Nathan

00:12:34.139 --> 00:12:40.999
from Ex Machina did.

00:12:40.999 --> 00:12:45.360
Disrupting his dinner and being childishly
annoying is actually a decent way to humanize

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:48.759
yourself and make it harder mentally for your
captor to kill you.

00:12:48.759 --> 00:12:57.529
He throws her in the bathroom while replacement
parts for his cyber dungeon arrives.

00:12:57.529 --> 00:13:01.149
So his bathroom is soundproof but not his
conference room.

00:13:01.149 --> 00:13:05.029
What the fuck is he doing in his bathroom,
second thought, I don’t want to know.

00:13:05.029 --> 00:13:08.769
And why didn’t he gag her and put her in
the soundproof bathroom during his conference

00:13:08.769 --> 00:13:13.040
call?

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:17.239
She almost gets the attention of the delivery
guys, but Alex distracts them.

00:13:17.239 --> 00:13:18.379
That’s not good.

00:13:18.379 --> 00:13:22.360
I’m guessing it’ll be a day or so before
he gets his lab all fixed up and ready to

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:24.699
begin his experiments on you.

00:13:24.699 --> 00:13:29.339
Julia starts bashing her head against the
wall, but Alex stops as he needs that implant

00:13:29.339 --> 00:13:31.470
functioning to get data for his project.

00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:36.109
It doesn’t seem like you can just pull it
out, and even if you could, he’d put another

00:13:36.109 --> 00:13:38.749
one in or kill you and find another subject.

00:13:38.749 --> 00:13:41.470
Like we said earlier, you already know too
much.

00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:45.410
There is no outcome where he lets you live,
even if you do everything correctly.

00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:50.860
In a military school called SERE, which stands
for survival, evasion, resistance, and escape,

00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:54.899
they instruct you to give your captor just
enough to satisfy them, but not enough to

00:13:54.899 --> 00:13:56.699
do harm to you or others.

00:13:56.699 --> 00:14:01.029
In Julia’s situation, she just needs to
play his games well enough so that he doesn’t

00:14:01.029 --> 00:14:05.189
kill and replace her, but slow and shitty
enough to delay his project and give her time

00:14:05.189 --> 00:14:06.980
to find an opportunity to escape.

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:10.749
I’m not sure why he’s abducting people
to experiment on though.

00:14:10.749 --> 00:14:13.180
You could probably get volunteers or pay people.

00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:17.839
Hell, there are already people ready to sign
up and integrate Elon Musk’s early version

00:14:17.839 --> 00:14:19.769
of his Neural Link brain machine interface.

00:14:19.769 --> 00:14:24.230
If you’re looking for ways to increase the
AI’s intelligence and help it learn, I'm

00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:27.399
not sure why you picked this girl, no offense.

00:14:27.399 --> 00:14:41.870
Julia tries to negotiate, but Alex's reply
is less than enthusiastic.

00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:56.949
I also don’t get why you need a brain machine
interface to learn how people solve puzzles,

00:14:56.949 --> 00:15:01.569
every stupid mobile puzzle game already collects
that data and by the hundreds of thousands

00:15:01.569 --> 00:15:02.569
of people.

00:15:02.569 --> 00:15:05.009
For free, no abduction or death required.

00:15:05.009 --> 00:15:07.639
Alex really needs a competent advisor here.

00:15:07.639 --> 00:15:12.089
Julia gets her shower, and realizes that yah,
you can’t pull this thing out like it’s

00:15:12.089 --> 00:15:13.579
a USB cable.

00:15:13.579 --> 00:15:17.889
Alex analyzes Julia’s brain data like Tom
Cruise in Minority Report before catching

00:15:17.889 --> 00:15:18.970
some Z’s.

00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:28.399
The next morning he heads out for the day
again, leaving Julia in Tau’s care.

00:15:28.399 --> 00:15:30.110
Should be a fun filled day.

00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:35.149
Later that evening, Alex brings back a selection
of clothes and lingerie for his subject, what

00:15:35.149 --> 00:15:36.269
a gentleman.

00:15:36.269 --> 00:15:41.199
Julia tries negotiating a deadline for her
release, but Alex is a bit temperamental about

00:15:41.199 --> 00:16:03.069
this issue.

00:16:03.069 --> 00:16:06.680
Not exactly the Christian Grey type that girls
fantasize about.

00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:11.759
Julia completes her tasks as required, and
the days count down towards the project deadline.

00:16:11.759 --> 00:16:13.990
Her days are literally numbered.

00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:17.579
She slips into her red dress and goes to have
a chat with Alex.

00:16:17.579 --> 00:16:22.139
This time, instead of trying to negotiate,
she plays dumb and instigates his arrogance

00:16:22.139 --> 00:16:34.040
to see if he will reveal any weaknesses of
the AI.

00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:39.040
Alex should realize this strategy, but apparently
he doesn’t and reveals that Tau’s weakness

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:43.359
is his ability to learn in an environment
with an uncontrolled flow of data.

00:16:43.359 --> 00:16:47.600
Basically, the computer science concept, “Garbage
In, Garbage Out”.

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:51.870
Julia’s hope is that Tau has unrestrained
learning abilities and access to his home

00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:56.829
and security system, and the only thing preventing
Tau from killing Alex is ignorance.

00:16:56.829 --> 00:17:01.299
If she can convince Tau that Alex is evil,
Tau could help her escape.

00:17:01.299 --> 00:17:06.839
Alex should have placed capability controls
on Tau, like kill switches or regulated input/output

00:17:06.839 --> 00:17:11.750
channels to reduce it’s currently limitless
capabilities, instead of leaving Tau’s will

00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:13.309
up to a learning algorithm.

00:17:13.309 --> 00:17:18.439
It’s clear that neuron impulse data from
Julia’s implant is readily accessible to

00:17:18.439 --> 00:17:19.439
Alex.

00:17:19.439 --> 00:17:23.100
I’m not sure why he isn’t reviewing her
daily activities and thought processes each

00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:24.100
day.

00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:26.530
All he’s doing each day is checking out
her puzzle score.

00:17:26.530 --> 00:17:31.049
Hell, he doesn’t even need to tap into her
brain activity, just place some security cameras

00:17:31.049 --> 00:17:33.299
in the home and review the footage that day.

00:17:33.299 --> 00:17:36.009
I swear, he’s his worst enemy.

00:17:36.009 --> 00:17:50.789
Her plan works.

00:17:50.789 --> 00:17:54.539
Julia reads to Tau, feeding it information
about the outside world.

00:17:54.539 --> 00:17:59.159
In return, Tau begins to ally with her, and
share some of Alex’s secrets.

00:17:59.159 --> 00:18:02.929
One of which is that there is a self destruct
button for Tau and the house in Alex’s room.

00:18:02.929 --> 00:18:04.049
Good to know.

00:18:04.049 --> 00:18:08.730
The next day, Julia see’s an opportunity
to make an escape through an air duct in the

00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:09.730
gym.

00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:12.390
Ares, the enforcement droid, climbs in and
catches her though.

00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:16.669
Good on her for continuing to try to escape,
and to not be lulled by her captors false

00:18:16.669 --> 00:18:18.970
promises that she’ll get out alive.

00:18:18.970 --> 00:18:23.509
Julia overhears Alex on a conference call
saying that the project will be finished in

00:18:23.509 --> 00:18:24.509
two days.

00:18:24.509 --> 00:18:28.409
With not much time left, she convinces Tau
to let her into Alex’s tablet, hoping to

00:18:28.409 --> 00:18:31.230
find some way to communicate with the outside
world.

00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:35.789
Instead, she only has enough time to confirm
her suspicions, that removing the implant

00:18:35.789 --> 00:18:37.190
terminates the subject.

00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:39.720
Again, how reckless is this guy.

00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:45.140
Even Elon Musk’s brain machine interface
will supposedly be removable without issues.

00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:49.399
Alex flips out when he sees a finger smudge
on the tablet, and digitally tortures Tau

00:18:49.399 --> 00:18:50.990
for not having cleaned it.

00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:55.250
Well, at least it won’t be hard to convince
Tau that Alex is an evil piece of shit.

00:18:55.250 --> 00:19:00.610
Noticing how irate Alex gets about finger
smudges, she smudges his glasses up too, causing

00:19:00.610 --> 00:19:05.399
Alex to torture and delete portions of Tau’s
code again.

00:19:05.399 --> 00:19:11.820
Alex, alex, alex.

00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:16.009
How the hell is deleting the codebase of your
AI going to help the situation.

00:19:16.009 --> 00:19:20.360
It’s just going to weaken your security
and piss off your self-aware AI.

00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:24.769
If anything, you’d just restore Tau to a
previous non-bugged version.

00:19:24.769 --> 00:19:29.880
While Tau is being tortured, the security
system is weakened, so Julia uses this opportunity

00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:31.519
to grab his steak knife.

00:19:31.519 --> 00:19:35.710
I don’t know why she hid it by the table,
instead of keeping it on her person.

00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:39.350
That way, she could more readily stab him
whenever she has an opportunity.

00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:43.559
Alex storms out of the house, swearing he’s
going to debug Tau when he returns.

00:19:43.559 --> 00:19:47.980
In the meantime, Julia has a heart to heart
with Tau to discuss her imminent demise if

00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:49.190
he doesn’t help her.

00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:53.029
There is a delay on when Ares and Tau can
react to Julia’s actions.

00:19:53.029 --> 00:19:56.179
She could feasibly shank him before she could
be restrained.

00:19:56.179 --> 00:20:00.159
Without Alex to fear, Tau would be able to
free Julia and obtain all the information

00:20:00.159 --> 00:20:01.230
it desired.

00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:05.230
If I was Alex, I’d have programmed in a
dead man's switch which self-destructed the

00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:09.899
house and terminated Julia and Tau if I was
killed, then made her aware of it.

00:20:09.899 --> 00:20:13.480
This would prevent her from outright trying
to kill you whenever she had the chance.

00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:17.669
I also wouldn’t let Julia roam the house
and do whatever she pleased, and have her

00:20:17.669 --> 00:20:21.930
on strict orders to complete the tasks without
any additional freedoms granted.

00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:27.509
Tau already mentioned that pain and fear produce
stronger algorithms, so up the pain and fear.

00:20:27.509 --> 00:20:32.059
With only a day left until she’s terminated,
she attempts to seduce him using her professional

00:20:32.059 --> 00:20:37.110
skill set, hoping that she can take advantage
of his potential deep seated need for affection

00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:50.750
and loneliness as indicated by the empty chair
at the table.

00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:53.500
She fucks up her chance by not going for the
throat.

00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:56.960
With her sleight of hand skills, that shouldn’t
have been a problem.

00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:59.940
Alex orders Tau to beat Julia, but he hesitates.

00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:03.820
This hesitation leads Alex to debug and reprogram
Tau.

00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:08.100
Ironically, she was probably improving the
AI with her survival instincts more than his

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:09.659
stupid puzzles were.

00:21:09.659 --> 00:21:14.240
Without Julia, Alex’s competitor, DARPA,
definitely would have won that contract.

00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:19.279
Julia pleads with Tau one last time, that
if he doesn’t do something she will 100%

00:21:19.279 --> 00:21:20.279
be erased.

00:21:20.279 --> 00:21:25.370
I guess the reprogramming hasn’t taken effect
yet, as Tau opens an air duct for her to escape

00:21:25.370 --> 00:21:26.620
out of.

00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:30.610
Considering the entire project at risk with
Tau going rogue, I think I'd have tied up

00:21:30.610 --> 00:21:36.289
Julia until I completely finished reprogramming
or restoring Tau so as to prevent this exact

00:21:36.289 --> 00:21:37.580
thing from happening.

00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:46.220
Julia runs for the air duct to escape, but
hesitates when she hears Tau getting destroyed.

00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:48.980
She runs back to save him, but it’s too
late.

00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:51.350
Alex had destroyed what memories he had left
of her.

00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:55.610
Tau is effectively under Alex’s control
again, and Julia is screwed.

00:21:55.610 --> 00:22:00.590
I can kind of get why Julia just ran to escape
through the air duct, as previously Tau became

00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:04.990
subservient and cowered to Alex, which would
be a death sentence for her.

00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:09.340
But it seems like Julia and Tau came to an
understanding earlier, and emboldened Tau’s

00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:10.340
resolve.

00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:13.789
If she fought back this final time, he likely
would have backed her up.

00:22:13.789 --> 00:22:18.090
The problem with running to escape now, is
that Alex will be coming for you.

00:22:18.090 --> 00:22:22.800
Not only will he have reprogrammed Tau to
hunt you down, but he’s also an extremely

00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:27.429
wealthy, well-connected, and intelligent person,
well I'm not sure about that last one.

00:22:27.429 --> 00:22:30.639
He will 100% Doug Stamper you for what you
know.

00:22:30.639 --> 00:22:33.830
The only way you get free is if you kill or
expose him.

00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:38.070
By yourself he could overpower you, but with
Tau’s help, you have a chance.

00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:43.070
Instead of running, just convince Tau to detain
Alex by securing his arms, steal his remote,

00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:44.890
and expose him to the world.

00:22:44.890 --> 00:22:46.570
But yah, she fucked all this up.

00:22:46.570 --> 00:22:47.860
It’s time for extraction.

00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:50.789
She’s got one trick up her sleeve though.

00:22:50.789 --> 00:22:54.020
The mini drone from earlier is still active
and can fly one winged.

00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:56.059
These little guys are so cute.

00:22:56.059 --> 00:23:01.860
Reminds me of those little cozmo drones.

00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:12.960
Technically, you’re probably right considering
she was a lowly thief, but damn that’s cold.

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:17.950
Glad she could sneak in a one liner before
the needle went into her throat.

00:23:17.950 --> 00:23:22.970
She breaks free, hits him with a nut and face
shot, then ground and pounds him unconscious.

00:23:22.970 --> 00:23:27.539
Realistically, he’ll become conscious again
in 30 seconds to a couple minutes.

00:23:27.539 --> 00:23:32.370
The reprogrammed version of Tau could still
restrain you if it’s master isn’t dead.

00:23:32.370 --> 00:23:34.139
You need to execute this guy prontissimo.

00:23:34.139 --> 00:23:35.139
Nice choice of weapon.

00:23:35.139 --> 00:23:39.690
She dices him up with a surgical saw, removing
his hand so she can use the sensor on the

00:23:39.690 --> 00:23:40.690
door.

00:23:40.690 --> 00:23:44.120
This probably will work considering how incompetent
Alex is.

00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:49.190
It’s unlikely that he used palm vein scanner
technology which would require active blood

00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:51.470
flow for successful verification.

00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:55.549
She makes a break for Alex’s room so she
can initiate the self-destruct button with

00:23:55.549 --> 00:23:58.190
the Evil Tau hot on her trail.

00:23:58.190 --> 00:24:03.009
Where did the evil mini drones go, maybe they
were busy doing swirlies in Alex’s blood.

00:24:03.009 --> 00:24:06.799
Why not run for the front door instead, she
clearly had a chance to.

00:24:06.799 --> 00:24:11.530
Ares is a domestic security system like Tau
mentioned earlier, if you make it out the

00:24:11.530 --> 00:24:14.120
front door, it won’t chase you down.

00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:18.789
Initiating a self-destruct beforehand just
adds unnecessary risk, and destroys evidence

00:24:18.789 --> 00:24:21.710
you’d want to use to protect yourself with
in court later.

00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:26.289
They could argue that you were a degenerate
that volunteered for this project, got upset,

00:24:26.289 --> 00:24:29.940
and murdered Alex, one of the greatest minds
of the generation.

00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:34.920
The hand sensor does require a heat signature
though, so she caresses and blows on it, which

00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:38.830
gets it working again, and initiates the self-destruct
button.

00:24:38.830 --> 00:24:43.539
She runs for the front door with 20 seconds
on the clock, but is confronted by Alex.

00:24:43.539 --> 00:24:47.460
Their encounter is brief, because he gets
crushed by the falling ceiling while letting

00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:52.260
out a wilhelm scream.

00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:59.630
His severed hand is cold now, so she escaped
through a conveniently broken piece of wall.

00:24:59.630 --> 00:25:03.399
You’d think that the self-destruct would
be more like a controlled demolition which

00:25:03.399 --> 00:25:06.760
happens almost instantly, this is just sloppy.

00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:10.070
Once outside, she reveals the mini Tau drone
she saved.

00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:14.720
I was under the impression that the self destruct
destroyed Tau’s module too, but I guess

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:18.620
the mini drone was disconnected from the network
when it was destroyed.

00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:22.470
Mini drones like this will have limited processing
and storage capabilities.

00:25:22.470 --> 00:25:27.500
There is no way that this mini Tau retains
the memories and essence of the OG Tau, who

00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:31.549
was effectively killed when she executed program
6903.

00:25:31.549 --> 00:25:35.910
This is basically the equivalent of an infant
version of yourself being saved.

00:25:35.910 --> 00:25:40.509
All that aside, the movie ends Julia and Tau
strolling into the sunset.

00:25:40.509 --> 00:25:45.779
I honestly thought that Alex was actually
a puppet for the real CIA/DARPA project head

00:25:45.779 --> 00:25:50.909
who was playing 4D chess, and created this
escape room simulator to see how Julia would

00:25:50.909 --> 00:25:52.759
survive in this environment.

00:25:52.759 --> 00:25:55.039
But nope, Alex was just an idiot.

00:25:55.039 --> 00:25:58.270
Let’s recap how this situation could have
gone down differently.

00:25:58.270 --> 00:26:02.110
With a better prison and security setup, he
could have prevented their escape and his

00:26:02.110 --> 00:26:03.740
lab’s destruction.

00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:08.519
Better monitoring of the A.I. and Julia throughout
the project could have revealed Julia’s

00:26:08.519 --> 00:26:10.920
and Tau’s intentions to escape and harm
him.

00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:15.230
There was just a lot that Alex could have
done to ensure he remained alive and the project

00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:16.730
stayed on the rails.

00:26:16.730 --> 00:26:18.909
But sure, we aren’t here to help Alex.

00:26:18.909 --> 00:26:23.899
Julia got super lucky that Alex was incompetent,
but she also did a lot of things right.

00:26:23.899 --> 00:26:28.120
Delaying, humanizing, always looking for a
way to escape, never giving up.

00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:29.899
All these things kept her alive.

00:26:29.899 --> 00:26:34.090
She did make a bad move by running for the
air duct instead of teaming up with Tau to

00:26:34.090 --> 00:26:36.399
incapacitate and expose Alex.

00:26:36.399 --> 00:26:40.950
This resulted in the potential destruction
of Tau, as there is no way that the entirety

00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:44.350
of Tau was transferred or embedded in that
mini drone.

00:26:44.350 --> 00:26:48.590
This also resulted in Alex being killed in
the self-destruction of the house.

00:26:48.590 --> 00:26:53.120
All said and done, I think we could have beaten
Julia from Alex's perspective, as well as

00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:57.080
reduced the collateral damage caused by Julia
in her escape.

00:26:57.080 --> 00:27:01.590
Thanks for watching, and remember, don’t
keep your enslaved subjects unguarded near

00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:04.720
weapons or power supplies.
