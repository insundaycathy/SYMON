00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:04.140
If you were driving through the New Mexican
desert with your family, stumbled into an

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.269
old nuclear test site, and were ambushed by
deformed murderers, what would you do?

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.469
In this How to Beat video, we’ll follow
a lost family, see if we can make better decisions,

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.590
and ultimately attempt to beat the Cannibal
Mutants in, The Hills Have Eyes.

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:21.250
Think you can do better or have a movie you’d
like me to cover, let me know in the comments!

00:00:21.250 --> 00:01:18.290
Enjoying these How to Beat videos, why not

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:39.250

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.680
and subscribe!

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:54.270
Alright, let’s outsmart some deformed mutants.

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.390
Maybe that’s a bit insensitive.

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.220
It wasn’t their fault that the U.S. government
decided to secretly test nuclear weapons in

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:01.220
the neighborhood.

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.750
I did a little digging around on nuclear weapons
testing in America and the genetic effects

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.509
of the fallout, and this story is not that
far fetched.

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:13.400
The U.S. government did detonate a significant
amount of nuclear bombs in the New Mexico

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.400
atmosphere.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.959
The restricted testing zones and containment
measures the government implemented usually

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.959
underestimated the bomb's abilities, resulting
in fallout radiation contaminating surrounding

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:27.540
vegetation, soil, water, wildlife, and local
inhabitants many miles away from the test

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:28.540
sites.

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.730
Apparently everyone in the contiguous United
States was exposed to some amount of fallout

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.180
radiation over the decades of nuclear bomb
testing, but people just outside the test

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.810
zone would have been exposed to significant
levels of radiation.

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.620
Much of this was shrouded in secrecy, so what
we know is the watered down version.

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.620
I’m not saying homicidal deformed mutants
were or could have been a thing, but it’s

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.010
not ‘that’ crazy.

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.930
The locals aren’t blameless.

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.330
After the fourth incidence of large explosions
and bright lights in the sky which were passed

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:03.959
off as chemical mill or ammunition dump explosions
by military officials, they should’ve thought

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:04.959
about moving.

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:09.299
Doesn’t take a genius to realize that after
the success of Hiroshima and Nagasaki the

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:13.630
government would want to experiment further,
that the desert is prime nuke testing real

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:18.120
estate, and that a derelict gas station attendant
a few miles south of the minimum restricted

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.099
zone would be considered acceptable ‘collateral
damage’.

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:26.329
Hell, I’d wager that they intentionally
found an area next to some nobodies in bumfuck

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:29.529
nowhere so they could see what the effects
on human bodies were.

00:03:29.529 --> 00:03:31.560
That’s definitely not what I would have
done..

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:37.690
Radiation testing in the first couple decades
of nuke testing in populated areas was routine,

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.129
but when you start to push out to the third
and fourth decade, that’s when the birth

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:53.910
defects and genetic mutations kick in and
you start running into trouble.

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:57.859
As expected, this test site was on or near
inhabited areas.

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:02.530
My only real issue here is that the government
did a piss-poor job of accounting and managing

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:03.530
the test subjects.

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:05.890
You don’t leave loose ends like this.

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:10.390
After you do decades of nuke testing and have
thoroughly mangled the genetic line of entire

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.450
families, you collect your results, put a
bullet in each of their heads, and bulldoze

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:17.200
their corpses into a big unmarked ditch.

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:21.290
Maybe you want a little more plausible deniability,
in which case you could just shift the nuke

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:26.070
test site a couple miles in their direction
and vaporize all the ‘evidence’.

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:30.440
We start out following the owner of the last
gas station for 200 miles in the New Mexican

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.320
desert, being harassed by the ‘locals’.

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:38.060
If I’m understanding this correctly, this
guy provides water, supplies, support, or

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.640
fresh meat, and in return the ‘locals’
hand him the victim’s loot.

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:46.590
This is why when I plan trips, I exclusively
take routes populated with strong brand named

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:47.660
gas stations.

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:50.340
You just don’t have these problems at QuikTrip.

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.530
Plus they have dope steak and cheese taquitos.

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.190
Now the attendant wants out.

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:57.660
Not gonna be so easy when the other party
relies on you for survival.

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:00.200
If he wanted out, he should have figured out
a better solution.

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:04.160
I doubt any cops venture this far out, so
he’s on his own.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:09.630
Honestly, he should just destroy the gas station,
poison the water well, and set up a tent in

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:10.630
California.

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:14.340
There’s no psycho mutants, there are other
people he can socialize with, there’s a

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:19.320
beach, there’s no psycho mutants, it isn’t
a hundred and ten degrees out, there’s homeless

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.200
shelters, and there’s no psycho mutants.

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.639
Without him baiting fresh meat for the mutants,
they’d likely starve to death.

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:30.240
Speaking of fresh meat, retired detective
Bob Carter and his wife Ethel are driving

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.650
from Cleveland to San Diego for their wedding
anniversary.

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:37.390
That's a 40 hour road trip, a lot of which
is through the desert.

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:38.830
Some anniversary, Bob.

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:42.770
You couldn’t splurge on a couple Frontier
Airlines economy class seats.

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:46.410
It’d be like, 4 hundred bucks round trip
for the both of you.

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:50.090
Your kids can pay for their own tickets or
drive themselves and meet you there.

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:54.970
Maybe they are masochists and just like endlessly
long sweltering drives through desolate regions

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:58.690
of the Earth with their children whining about
the lack of cell reception.

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:02.360
In which case they should be able to just
follow I-40 all the way there.

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.630
I'm not sure why they are detouring off of
I-25.

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:08.060
There’s no reason to, it’s not even a
shortcut.

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:12.520
While everyone is distracted, someone, something,
is snooping around the camper looking for

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:13.530
some goodies.

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:18.190
Is this little mutant girl a part of Sam Fisher’s
splinter cell, because either she’s got

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:22.650
3rd person view and sonar goggles or these
NPC’s have horrible line of sight and view

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:23.930
cone ranges.

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:28.490
Bobby boy’s got to go, and gets scolded
by his sister into using the outhouse instead

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:29.490
of a plant.

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:34.100
Bob, I'm with you, that outhouse has got to
be absolutely filthy and the plants could

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:35.500
use some hydration.

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:36.970
So Bobby’s an idiot.

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:41.530
How on God’s forsaken Earth did you not
see the intestines and organic matter strewn

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:44.940
everywhere ‘before’ sitting down, and
360 out of there.

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:49.940
Not to mention there can't be any fresh TP
in there to lay on the toilet seat, so he’s

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:54.480
bare assing pure filth.

00:06:54.480 --> 00:07:00.120
I just noticed this and my last video both
had people getting jumped in outhouses.

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:04.460
More confirmation that remote outhouses are
death zones and should be used with utmost

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:08.220
caution.

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:11.990
Eh.

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:13.370
Am I missing something?

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:15.960
There's no I-88 in New Mexico.

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:20.180
Either way, a former detective such as our
romantic Bob Carter should’ve been using

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:24.310
maps to navigate and track their location
better so they didn’t get lost.

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:28.080
I suppose there’s a good chance you’d
get lost out here and end up relying on a

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:32.560
random gas station attendant for directions,
and there’s no reason to suspect them of

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:34.530
harboring cannibalistic mutants.

00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:39.060
Their dog gets loose and runs off into the
convenience store, when Lynn chases her down,

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:43.840
she finds a bag full of items that certainly
don’t belong to the esteemed owner of this

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:44.840
joint.

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:46.310
It’s clear something doesn’t smell right.

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:50.270
Right before the family heads out, the attendant
gives them some last minute directions on

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:51.930
a shortcut through the hills.

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:54.090
Guess the deal with the devil is still on.

00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:58.590
If Lynn wasn’t there, there’d be no reason
not to trust this guy and take the shortcut.

00:07:58.590 --> 00:07:59.960
But Lynn was there.

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:02.960
She saw the nice bag full of jewelry and electronics.

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:07.010
There’s barely any customers around here
so he sure as shit didn’t buy them.

00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:11.000
He also doesn’t seem like the pearl necklace
type and there’s no misses around.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.470
Which all begs the question, where’d he
get them and how’d he get them?

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:18.480
Lynn’s now in the backseat and he rolls
up and tells you all to take a path off the

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:19.480
beaten road.

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:23.580
I’d say that’s reason enough to tell Bob
it ain’t a good idea based on what you saw,

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:28.170
and that if he didn’t mind the drive then
let’s just take the official scenic route.

00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:32.360
Taking unknown routes where there’s no traffic
or cell signal is reckless.

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:36.149
Bob seems like a stubborn ass, so there’s
still a good chance he’d overrule you and

00:08:36.149 --> 00:08:46.029
take the shortcut.

00:08:46.029 --> 00:08:50.300
In Bob’s head he probably knew this was
dangerous but thought, eh, what’re the chances

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:52.389
something bad actually happens to me.

00:08:52.389 --> 00:08:55.990
Well Bob, something bad did happen, and now
you're short on options.

00:08:55.990 --> 00:09:01.889
His plan is to hike 8 miles back to the gas
station by himself, while Doug hikes 5-6 towards

00:09:01.889 --> 00:09:06.660
the ridgeline to try and get a signal to truckers
on the freeway, while the rest camp out and

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:07.660
wait.

00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:11.819
Reasonable enough, but with no cell signal,
treacherous terrain, venomous rattlesnakes,

00:09:11.819 --> 00:09:15.819
and sunset approaching, I think Doug and Bob
should both wait until morning to go to the

00:09:15.819 --> 00:09:17.149
gas station together.

00:09:17.149 --> 00:09:22.300
The gas station is potentially a 6 hour round
trip if things don’t pan out, and that’s

00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:25.610
based on Bob’s clearly shitty sense of distance
and direction.

00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:27.560
And nightfall is in a few hours.

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:28.829
It’s too risky.

00:09:28.829 --> 00:09:33.259
It’d be nice to have someone with a gun
stay behind by the camper, but not if it’s

00:09:33.259 --> 00:09:36.360
a teenage boy that doesn’t understand the
first rule of gun safety.

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:40.600
Damn Bob, you’re a cop, at least knock some
sense into him before handing him the gun.

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:44.339
Doug’s more of the pacifist side, so he’s
not really an option.

00:09:44.339 --> 00:09:46.860
Their poor training of their dogs is really
showing.

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:50.759
This is the second time they’ve run off
to random areas for no reason.

00:09:50.759 --> 00:09:56.240
You won’t be catching them, so just go back
and put some food out.

00:09:56.240 --> 00:10:05.680
Okay okay, yes if that was my dog i’d be
going after him regardless of whatever danger

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:08.660
there was, even though It’d probably lead
to my demise.

00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:12.339
At least Bobby picked up a rock to use as
a weapon, that’s more than you could say

00:10:12.339 --> 00:10:14.300
for a lot of soon-to-be victims.

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:18.180
He finds a blood trail that leads to every
dog owner's worst nightmare.

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:21.670
The real fucked part is that she was gutted
with a knife.

00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:23.279
Someone evil is out here.

00:10:23.279 --> 00:10:25.870
This could easily be a trap and you could
be next.

00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:27.550
Should’ve brought that pistol homeboy.

00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:32.620
He then freaks out and frantically runs off
of a cliff, knocking himself unconscious.

00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:36.379
Tempting to criticise, but I guess I can see
that if you’re running from something and

00:10:36.379 --> 00:10:40.800
constantly looking back to make sure they
aren’t catching up to you, this could happen.

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:42.529
It’s not looking good for lil Bobby.

00:10:42.529 --> 00:10:46.920
Doug summits the ridgeline, and instead of
finding a freeway he stumbles into what appears

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:50.180
to be a car park situated inside a nuke crater.

00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:54.560
Okay so we aren’t even talking about the
wind carrying fallout outside the restricted

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:59.129
zone, there are literally humans pitching
up tents inside the actual nuke craters.

00:10:59.129 --> 00:11:04.339
How is the military this negligent, and how
were those initial humans so stupid.

00:11:04.339 --> 00:11:07.750
This looks to be the Trinity Site in the White
Sands Missile Range.

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:12.910
By 2006, this nuke testing site would be on
the map and if you were planning any travel

00:11:12.910 --> 00:11:15.540
through new mexico, you’d be taking a path
around it.

00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:17.740
The freeway isn’t even on the horizon.

00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:20.750
Can nobody read a map, for fucks sake.

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:23.759
Detective Bob doesn’t even reach the gas
station until nightfall.

00:11:23.759 --> 00:11:27.839
When he goes inside looking for help, he finds
what Lynn found, plus the carton with the

00:11:27.839 --> 00:11:28.839
ear in it.

00:11:28.839 --> 00:11:33.259
It’s at this point, when he realizes that
his bad day was about to get a whole lot worse.

00:11:33.259 --> 00:11:38.139
Or as I like to say, his worst case scenario,
just became his best case scenario.

00:11:38.139 --> 00:11:41.779
This gas station attendant sure does keep
good records of everything that went down.

00:11:41.779 --> 00:11:45.360
I guess a bunch of miners didn’t want to
leave the test zone, so the military burnt

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:48.569
their town to the ground and the families
fled into the hills and caves.

00:11:48.569 --> 00:11:52.920
I’d say he has the right idea to fire up
the old man's car and drive back, but the

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:53.920
car doesn’t turn over.

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:57.999
He hears the gas station attendants incoherent
whining coming from the outhouse and goes

00:11:57.999 --> 00:11:59.060
to check it out.

00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:02.329
I think I'd stay in the car and try to get
the engine running.

00:12:02.329 --> 00:12:07.009
Absolutely nothing good will come from checking
it out.

00:12:07.009 --> 00:12:14.019
There’s a number of things I could comment
on here, but I'm going to tackle the big one.

00:12:14.019 --> 00:12:17.899
Why would he choose a vile, putrid outhouse
to commit suicide in.

00:12:17.899 --> 00:12:19.990
Why not the comfort of his bed?

00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:24.499
Bob doesn’t even have time to regret his
decisions before creepy voices saying Daddy

00:12:24.499 --> 00:12:26.990
start originating from the darkness surrounding
him.

00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:32.100
He flips around letting 4 shots ring off with
zero target identification or accuracy.

00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:33.100
Some cop.

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:36.740
You know that’s a six shooter, not a high-capacity
magazine fed pistol.

00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:38.470
You can’t be wasting shots like that.

00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:47.240
Bob’s final mistake was getting back into
the car without checking the back seat first.

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:49.769
Somehow Bobby is still unconscious hours later.

00:12:49.769 --> 00:12:54.330
In real life it would be extremely rare that
he wasn’t conscious yet, and indicative

00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:56.189
of a severe TBI.

00:12:56.189 --> 00:12:59.350
Luckily not all of these mutants are complete
savages.

00:12:59.350 --> 00:13:03.699
Brenda somehow finds Bobby at night in these
rocky hills and takes him back to get patched

00:13:03.699 --> 00:13:06.889
up, where he foregoes mentioning that Beauty
was killed and gutted.

00:13:06.889 --> 00:13:11.470
Look, I get you don’t want to drop that
bomb on everyone, haha get it, but you all

00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:14.710
are in serious danger and everyone needs to
be up to speed.

00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:16.769
Especially with Doug and Bob still missing.

00:13:16.769 --> 00:13:20.889
The ladies said they tried the radio, but
all they heard was perverted breathing.

00:13:20.889 --> 00:13:29.230
Hopefully that wasn’t from the radio Doug
was carrying.

00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:33.819
You just became conscious after suffering
serious head trauma, you know a murderer is

00:13:33.819 --> 00:13:37.839
out there, and you think going outside in
the darkness is the best course of action.

00:13:37.839 --> 00:13:41.850
Oh, and you think not telling everyone what
happened is somehow protecting them.

00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:45.779
I gotta say, I can’t fucking stand when
people hold there tongues for no reason like

00:13:45.779 --> 00:13:46.779
this.

00:13:46.779 --> 00:13:50.059
Everyone’s now tucking themselves in for
the night, completely ignorant to the danger

00:13:50.059 --> 00:13:51.059
around them.

00:13:51.059 --> 00:13:55.120
Bobby can’t get any sleep, hears Beast barking,
and goes out looking for him.

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:58.540
It’s probably a trap, but again, somewhat
understandable.

00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:01.499
The only difference is I wouldn’t travel
that far from the camper.

00:14:01.499 --> 00:14:04.079
Given the circumstances, my dog can come to
me.

00:14:04.079 --> 00:14:08.120
Besides not telling anyone about the murder,
leaving the camper unguarded with him having

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:16.249
the only pistol, he also left the camper door
unlocked.

00:14:16.249 --> 00:14:19.589
Now you’ve waited until shit’s gotten
bad enough and you’re already in too deep

00:14:19.589 --> 00:14:20.809
to warn everyone.

00:14:20.809 --> 00:14:26.459
When he gets back to the camper, all hell
breaks loose.

00:14:26.459 --> 00:14:33.679
They all get distracted by Bob’s burning
man exhibit to notice the mutants attacking

00:14:33.679 --> 00:14:37.269
Brenda, drinking their milk, playing with
their baby, and eating their birds.

00:14:37.269 --> 00:14:42.180
The fire extinguisher is completely useless
against a fire like that, but yah, you kind

00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:43.339
of have to try.

00:14:43.339 --> 00:14:46.910
After Bob succumbs to the flames, they can
finally hear Brenda’s screaming back in

00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:47.910
the camper.

00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:51.230
Instead of going to help Brenda and Lynn and
the baby, Bobby runs off into the hills to

00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:52.339
‘kill those motherfuckers’.

00:14:52.339 --> 00:14:55.209
Dude, they are in your camper, hence the screaming.

00:14:55.209 --> 00:15:00.040
That goes for you too Doug, Bob is burnt to
a crisp, he’s dead as shit, go help your

00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:01.720
fucking family that’s being attacked.

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:04.810
You can give Bob a proper burial later.

00:15:04.810 --> 00:15:11.250
I can’t say I had much hope for the mom
at this point.

00:15:11.250 --> 00:15:12.680
At least she tried.

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:17.420
There’s a few moments where Lizard is distracted
waving the gun at Brenda, which Lynn uses

00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:19.589
to shank his leg with a screwdriver.

00:15:19.589 --> 00:15:24.050
Now believe it or not, I don’t have firsthand
experience with situations like this, but

00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:26.629
that’s not going to stop me from armchair
quarterbacking.

00:15:26.629 --> 00:15:31.009
Lynn really should have gone for a vital area
like his neck then immediately grabbed for

00:15:31.009 --> 00:15:32.009
the gun.

00:15:32.009 --> 00:15:38.139
Because she didn’t he was able to drop the
muzzle on her head.

00:15:38.139 --> 00:15:42.300
Lizard runs out of ammo, and knowing he can’t
take Doug and Bobby on, scrambles off into

00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:43.649
the night with the baby.

00:15:43.649 --> 00:15:47.459
Bobby wastes more rounds firing at them in
the distance, precious rounds that they’re

00:15:47.459 --> 00:15:48.970
definitely going to need later.

00:15:48.970 --> 00:15:53.059
Doug and Bobby get back to the trailer and
find the mom and Lynn blown away and the baby

00:15:53.059 --> 00:15:54.059
gone.

00:15:54.059 --> 00:15:56.630
That reality has to absolutely hit like a
train.

00:15:56.630 --> 00:16:00.629
I think most of us underestimate how much
this would kick you out of your own body.

00:16:00.629 --> 00:16:05.649
Oh, Beast is alive, and wasting no time getting
some payback.

00:16:05.649 --> 00:16:10.630
That’s a good doggo.

00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:14.990
Doug and Bobby’s yelling match is interrupted
by the voices of more mutants outside.

00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:18.950
Continuing with the theme of Bobby being a
monkey with a gun, he wastes more rounds firing

00:16:18.950 --> 00:16:19.990
through the wall.

00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:23.769
You have know idea how many are out there
or where they are.

00:16:23.769 --> 00:16:27.430
You are far from home or help, and there’s
maybe 10 rounds left in that gun.

00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:31.209
Unless you enjoy fighting with your teeth
and nails, I’d suggest waiting until you’re

00:16:31.209 --> 00:16:35.939
close enough that you can't miss, which for
the untrained person, like Bobby, is around

00:16:35.939 --> 00:16:37.250
point blank range.

00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:41.360
They sneak out of the cabin to check out the
damage, not checking high and low like they

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:42.360
should.

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:44.639
Looks like he did hit something and knocked
an arm of one of them.

00:16:44.639 --> 00:16:48.800
When Doug turns back around he see’s movement
under the camper and instructs Bobby to fire

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:53.119
through the ground.

00:16:53.119 --> 00:16:57.529
Not a moment later Beast shows up, and they
both immediately forget that there was something

00:16:57.529 --> 00:16:59.089
under the camper that Brenda is in.

00:16:59.089 --> 00:17:01.079
You gotta confirm your kills, people.

00:17:01.079 --> 00:17:04.990
Their new plan is for Doug to take Beast and
track the mutant's blood back to their lair

00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:08.350
in the mining tunnels, while Bobby watches
over Brenda with the pistol.

00:17:08.350 --> 00:17:11.740
It would seem they’ve decided to split up..

00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:12.740
How original.

00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:16.829
Brenda is a total wreck right now and bringing
her would be difficult, but I still think

00:17:16.829 --> 00:17:19.649
staying together and heading to the mines
is the better option.

00:17:19.649 --> 00:17:22.649
They are just much easier targets when isolated.

00:17:22.649 --> 00:17:25.970
And if they want their baby back, they’re
going to need all the man and firepower they

00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:26.970
get muster.

00:17:26.970 --> 00:17:30.750
Doug crashing the mutant family dinner with
a flashlight and a baseball bat probably won’t

00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:34.880
work out too hot, considering he has no idea
how many of them there are down there.

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:39.789
Or it will work out great for Doug with nobody
being home and baby Catherine being unguarded,

00:17:39.789 --> 00:17:43.240
because all the psycho’s are at the camper
spit-roasting Bobby and Brenda.

00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:47.039
Going for outside help won’t work, so it’s
time for Doug to sack up and put the team

00:17:47.039 --> 00:17:48.039
on his back.

00:17:48.039 --> 00:17:52.899
He comes across a miner graveyard in the tunnels
marked with pickaxes, which could be used

00:17:52.899 --> 00:17:55.820
as weapons but, we are talking about Doug
here.

00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:59.320
A baseball bat is going to be easier and less
tiring to swing.

00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:02.760
When he emerges out the other end of the tunnel,
there’s a small town set up.

00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:04.620
It’s actually kind of a big town.

00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:09.019
Way too big for Doug to handle on his own,
so he radios his report to Bobby who left

00:18:09.019 --> 00:18:10.540
the fucking radio in the trailer.

00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:13.190
Dude, the radio is no good if it’s not on
you.

00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:17.400
I’d have maybe hung out for a bit and scouted
the area to see who came and went, how many

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:20.610
people were there, and what homes they came
and left from.

00:18:20.610 --> 00:18:24.799
Doug walks into the nuketown like he’s Clint
Eastwood and wanders around until he finds

00:18:24.799 --> 00:18:27.179
the one house with a running generator next
to it.

00:18:27.179 --> 00:18:31.559
Good news, found the baby, bad news, there’s
huge mutants with shotguns.

00:18:31.559 --> 00:18:34.090
Bet you’re wishing you had backup and that
pistol.

00:18:34.090 --> 00:18:37.890
There’s no way he sneaks out with the baby
crying and dog barking.

00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:41.750
It’s going to be a fight.

00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:44.110
Or a quick bop to the head from left field.

00:18:44.110 --> 00:18:45.110
Yah.

00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:47.820
Can’t say I was too optimistic about his
lone rescue mission.

00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:52.350
The only thing he has going for him is his
relatively higher IQ, and the luck that he

00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:55.929
wasn’t severely injured or killed before
being put in the meat bin with a weak lock

00:18:55.929 --> 00:18:57.669
and his weapons right beside it.

00:18:57.669 --> 00:18:59.200
Is that big Bob?

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:00.200
Oof.

00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:01.300
Happy anniversary bud.

00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:05.900
In the next room Doug finds ones of the most
badly deformed mutants in the group, ranting

00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:08.690
about how, “you made us what we’ve become.”

00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:10.940
Bro, Doug sells cell phones.

00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:15.909
He hardly had anything to do with the nuking
or your dumbfuck decision to stay in a nuke

00:19:15.909 --> 00:19:16.909
testing site.

00:19:16.909 --> 00:19:19.540
Take responsibility for your actions for Christ’s
sake.

00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:22.149
This Big Brain mutant, I wouldn’t kill.

00:19:22.149 --> 00:19:24.640
This one’s worst fate is a long life.

00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:35.840
As Leonidas said to Ephilates, may you live
forever.

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:40.270
Pluto busts in for breakfast time and nearly
gets the drop on Doug, but Beast being the

00:19:40.270 --> 00:19:43.010
good doggo he is comes to the rescue.

00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:46.860
Instead of using that opportunity to try to
kill the mutant and save his dog, he runs

00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:49.289
off like a little bitch and leaves Beast hanging.

00:19:49.289 --> 00:19:52.390
For a cell phone salesman, he’s damn quick
on his feet.

00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:56.990
Doug gets the first cut, but again, wastes
the opportunity watching Pluto slowly pull

00:19:56.990 --> 00:19:58.620
the bat out of his stomach.

00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:02.929
How bad do you have to fuck up, where your
weapon was inside the enemy, and somehow,

00:20:02.929 --> 00:20:04.660
you end up getting clobbered with it.

00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:09.299
The mutant’s low intelligence, or just sheer
lack of proper entertainment, leads to him

00:20:09.299 --> 00:20:22.740
carelessly playing with his food until Doug
finally capitalizes on something.

00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:29.649
I will say, Doug redeemed himself a bit with
that 3 move chess play.

00:20:29.649 --> 00:20:40.590
Now for Mr. Shotgun.

00:20:40.590 --> 00:20:46.350
And Mr. Big Brain.

00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:49.350
Seems Doug had a change of heart on the whole
anti-gun thing.

00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:53.139
What, you didn’t enjoy all that hand to
hand fighting earlier when all you would’ve

00:20:53.139 --> 00:20:55.019
needed to do is squeeze a trigger.

00:20:55.019 --> 00:21:00.010
For a teenage boy, rigging up a tripwire early
warning system with a fishing line was pretty

00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:01.010
smart.

00:21:01.010 --> 00:21:02.480
Wait, why do they have fishing gear.

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:06.929
Was Bob planning on going fishing during his
anniversary trip with his wife.

00:21:06.929 --> 00:21:07.929
Wowwww.

00:21:07.929 --> 00:21:11.260
The problem with his setup is that he should
have attached noisemakers to different parts

00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:15.080
of the tripwire, and sat on the roof of the
camper, so that when something tripped it

00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:17.940
he would know which side and could spot the
intruder quickly.

00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:22.760
You’d also want to sit on top of the camper
for better visibility and because high ground,

00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:23.760
duh.

00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:27.049
They get duped again and one of the psychos
steals their mom for supper.

00:21:27.049 --> 00:21:30.650
Bobby starts blindfiring while running which
again, wastes the ammo.

00:21:30.650 --> 00:21:34.220
If someone is running at you and you have
a gun, you’re far better off standing your

00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:38.620
ground, waiting until they get close, and
making as accurate of shots as possible.

00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:42.821
But somehow this was all part of the plan,
and Bobby has the wherewithal, ability, and

00:21:42.821 --> 00:21:47.299
omnipotent knowledge to design a trap where
he’d hogtie the person who he knows will

00:21:47.299 --> 00:21:51.889
come through the window, they will run, and
then the mutant will get free, open the door,

00:21:51.889 --> 00:21:55.880
the matches will strike, the gas bombs will
go..

00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:57.960
Sure..

00:21:57.960 --> 00:22:01.710
Anyone who has ever used matches before would
know that designing a trap that relies on

00:22:01.710 --> 00:22:04.100
them to light in one strike is stupid.

00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:08.340
This rube-goldberg bullshit worked through
sheer luck, and he should have prioritized

00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:09.870
better usage of his pistol.

00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:14.279
Doug corners the little girl with his baby,
but gets ambushed and clobbered by Lizard.

00:22:14.279 --> 00:22:17.300
Lizard gets distracted and runs after Ruby
who has the baby.

00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:22.639
With how fast Lizard is, he could easily have
taken a few extra seconds to fully kill Doug

00:22:22.639 --> 00:22:25.780
or at least grab the shotgun before chasing
down Ruby.

00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:35.070
And because he made this fatal error..

00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:38.510
Doug dropping the shotty next to Lizard was
a terrible mistake too.

00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:43.019
You would never want to drop a loaded gun
next to an enemy, even one who was seemingly

00:22:43.019 --> 00:22:44.019
dead.

00:22:44.019 --> 00:22:47.290
Wouldn’t you want to keep the shotgun anyways,
in case you ran into more mutants?

00:22:47.290 --> 00:22:52.080
With his last dying breath, Lizard rises from
the grave and draws down with the shotgun.

00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:56.970
Before Doug and his baby catch a load of double-aught
buckshot, Ruby tackles him off the cliff.

00:22:56.970 --> 00:22:58.860
RIP nice little mutant girl.

00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:06.450
They’re getting some payback back at camp
too.

00:23:06.450 --> 00:23:07.450
Damn Brenda.

00:23:07.450 --> 00:23:11.941
The movie ends with the family reunited, well,
except for their wife, mom, and dad, in a

00:23:11.941 --> 00:23:15.490
remote desert with more mutants stalking them
from a distance.

00:23:15.490 --> 00:23:18.679
From here, they’ll need to walk 9 miles
back to the gas station.

00:23:18.679 --> 00:23:22.410
There should be water and a running car they
can use to drive out of there and get help.

00:23:22.410 --> 00:23:25.820
Who knows if they will make it with more mutants
preying upon them.

00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:27.669
Probably should have kept that shotgun, Doug.

00:23:27.669 --> 00:23:30.460
Let’s recap how things could have gone down
differently.

00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:34.110
This massacre could have been avoided if the
miners weren’t idiots who wanted to stay

00:23:34.110 --> 00:23:38.580
in a nuke testing site, the military had tied
up their loose ends, Bob wasn’t a cheap

00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:42.779
asshole and got flights instead, or if Bob
at least knew how to read a map.

00:23:42.779 --> 00:23:46.150
In which case the mutants would be dead and
the whole family would be alive.

00:23:46.150 --> 00:23:50.330
The whole family also would have survived
if when Lynn saw the stolen goods, she told

00:23:50.330 --> 00:23:53.070
her dad and had them take the official route
back.

00:23:53.070 --> 00:23:57.149
Even if she didn’t and they crashed like
in the movie, if Bob and Doug didn’t split

00:23:57.149 --> 00:24:00.870
up and waited until morning to go to the gas
station, they’d likely have been way more

00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:03.690
successful taking the old man's car and getting
help.

00:24:03.690 --> 00:24:07.710
The gas attendant was suicidal after sending
the family down death’s road, and would

00:24:07.710 --> 00:24:11.899
have killed himself that previous night anyways,
and without a source of food, the mutants

00:24:11.899 --> 00:24:13.130
would starve and die.

00:24:13.130 --> 00:24:16.870
Who knows how these alternate paths would
have worked out, but I think we could have

00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:21.029
beaten the Cannibal Mutants from The Hills
Have Eyes with less life and limb lossed.

00:24:21.029 --> 00:24:25.759
Thanks for watching, and remember, if you’re
driving through New Mexico, stay on the official

00:24:25.759 --> 00:24:27.239
roads.
