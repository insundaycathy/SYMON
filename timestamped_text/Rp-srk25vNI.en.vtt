00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:11.230
Hey everyone. Welcome back to Movie Recap.
My name is Silverra. Today I'm gonna show

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:15.382
you a 2005 American psychological thriller
film called, Red Eye.

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:21.590
After attending her grandmother's funeral
in Dallas, Texas, Lisa Reisert who has a

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.173
fear of flying, takes a red-eye flight to
Miami, Florida.

00:00:26.486 --> 00:00:30.721
While in the check-in line she meets an older
lady who is interested in Lisa's Dr. Phil

00:00:30.721 --> 00:00:36.302
book. She tells her she's a fan, so Lisa gives
the woman her book saying she has already read it.

00:00:38.085 --> 00:00:43.070
Lisa also meets Jackson Rippner, a man whom
she initially finds charming. After their

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.550
flight is delayed due to weather, Lisa meets
with Jackson again in the bar and they talk

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.710
to each other while having a drink. When boarding,
Lisa is pleasantly surprised to find that

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.220
Jackson is seated beside her. She's even more
impressed when Rippner calms down a rude passenger

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.853
who was giving a hard time to the airline
attendant.

00:01:03.048 --> 00:01:08.250
After take-off, Lisa is shocked when Jackson
transitions into something she never expected,

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.680
revealing to her that he is a terrorist operative
working for a group who intends to assassinate

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.531
the United States Deputy Secretary of Homeland
Security Charles Keefe and his family. He

00:01:17.531 --> 00:01:22.350
tells Lisa that she is instrumental in their
plans because of her job as Acting Manager

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.330
at the Lux Atlantic Hotel where the Keefe
family will be staying. If she refuses to

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.858
cooperate, Rippner will deploy a hit man to
kill her father, Joe at his home in Miami.

00:01:34.624 --> 00:01:39.299
Lisa's task is to use the in-flight phone
to call her assistant at the hotel and tell

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.400
her to change the room that the Keefe's will
be staying in, even though they always stay

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:48.600
in the same room and any room they use has
to be pre-cleared by the Secret Service. Lisa

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.910
tries to convince Rippner that she doesn't
have that authority, but he knows better and

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:57.040
orders her to make the call and order the
hotel staff to change the reservation from

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:02.208
the inner room 3825 to suite 4080, which faces
the harbor.

00:02:04.368 --> 00:02:09.670
When Lisa first places a call to the hotel,
answered by her co-worker, Cynthia, the line

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.220
goes dead midway through the conversation,
and Lisa tries to fool Rippner into thinking

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.700
she is ordering the room change as directed,
but then Rippner notices a nearby passenger

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.730
trying to make a call and looking with frustration
at his phone. There's a message on the screen

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.450
on the back of the phone which says "service
temporarily unavailable." Rippner grabs the

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.807
phone away from Lisa and confirms it's dead.
He's not happy.

00:02:34.561 --> 00:02:39.690
Lisa attempts to find a way to keep both her
father and Keefe safe. Her first attempt is

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.230
when the older lady from the check-in line
comes to talk to her about the Dr. Phil book. 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.470
Rippner had been asked by the flight attendant
to help with positioning some luggage in the

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.410
overhead. The woman asks Lisa to write some
things in the book. Lisa tries to write a

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:58.860
warning in the book, but Rippner is ever vigilant
and realizes what she was doing. When he returns

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.959
to his seat, he head butts her unconscious
and puts a pillow under her head to make it

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:07.989
appear she is simply sleeping. He then manages
to steal the book back from the older woman

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:09.919
before she is able to see the message.

00:03:11.673 --> 00:03:16.340
Lisa tries again by going into the restroom
and writing a warning on the mirror with hand

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:21.019
soap, that there's a bomb where Rippner is
sitting. As she opens the door to leave the

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:25.709
restroom, Rippner is standing there. He sees
the message on the mirror and pushes Lisa

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:30.460
back into the restroom and shuts the door.
He slams her around and chokes her, then wipes

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:35.760
the message off. He warns her again not to
gamble with her father's life. Rippner notices

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.580
a scar above Lisa's meatball and asks her
about that, but she refuses to answer.

00:03:42.601 --> 00:03:46.940
A small girl who was waiting to use the restroom
tells the flight attendant that two people

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:51.420
were in the restroom. The flight attendant
assumes the couple are in the process of becoming

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:56.209
members of the Mile High Club, so she doesn't
intervene, but the little girl is savvy enough

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:01.410
to realize that things aren't that way between
the man and woman in the restroom. Nevertheless,

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.025
she remains quiet about it during the rest
of the flight.

00:04:06.232 --> 00:04:11.030
When Lisa and Jackson return to their seats,
Lisa makes the phone call to Cynthia, and

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:15.340
Cynthia meets the Keefes and their Secret
Service escorts in the lobby and informs them

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:20.280
of the need to change the room due to a plumbing
problem. When Keefe learns it was Lisa who

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.971
ordered the change, he tells the Secret Service
to go ahead and clear the new room.

00:04:26.945 --> 00:04:31.840
Lisa wants Rippner to call his hit man and
order him to stand down, now that she'd done

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.229
her part, but Rippner says he still needs
her, as he can't let her and her father go

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:40.771
until he gets a phone call confirming that
Keefe has been successfully dealt with. When

00:04:40.771 --> 00:04:45.699
she expresses concern that the hit man might
get impatient and act before being called

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:50.319
off, Jackson reassures her that he'll only
act on Jackson's orders, saying that "he's

00:04:50.319 --> 00:04:55.849
a good dog, who only responds to the sound
of his master's voice." Lisa soon realizes

00:04:55.849 --> 00:05:00.485
that not only Keefe to be killed, but his
family too, and she's even more distressed.

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:07.449
The Secret Service do a thorough sweep of
the new room and even contact the Coast Guard

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:12.110
to go investigate a fishing boat sitting way
out in the harbor. When the Coast Guard boards

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:17.270
and inspects the boat, they call in that it's
all clear. The hotel staff then move Keefe

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:19.049
and his family into the new suite.

00:05:21.267 --> 00:05:26.289
As the plane is landing in Miami, Lisa confides
in Rippner, telling him that the scar on her

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:31.479
throat was from a knife held to her throat
by a rapist two years ago. When Rippner observes

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:35.439
that there was nothing she could do about
it, she disagrees and tells him she swore

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:39.750
that she would never let it happen again.
She then jerks her right hand and arm up and

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:44.039
around and stabs Rippner in the throat with
an ink pen she stole earlier from a young

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:45.106
male passenger.

00:05:47.034 --> 00:05:52.669
The pen punctures Rippner's windpipe and damages
his vocal chords. Lisa climbs over him and

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:57.610
as she goes by, she takes his phone and scrambles
to make her way through the aisle and other

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:02.210
passengers to the main exit door. A young
male passenger who'd been falsely accused

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:07.304
by his friend of taking his ink pen, wryly
observes that now they know what happened to his pen.

00:06:09.635 --> 00:06:14.660
Lisa has to wait until the door is open, giving
time for Rippner to gather himself, pull the

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:19.889
pen from his throat, wrap a scarf around his
neck, and start after her. Rippner is slowed

00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:23.939
a bit more when the little girl who'd been
observing him during the flight shoves her

00:06:23.939 --> 00:06:27.709
little carryon bag out into the aisle, tripping
him and knocking him down.

00:06:30.067 --> 00:06:34.080
The men on that fishing boat that had been
cleared by the Coast Guard, are shown hauling

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:38.589
in a fishing line. On the other end of the
line is a large container which they load

00:06:38.589 --> 00:06:45.039
onboard and open, revealing the component
parts to an FGM-148 Javelin man-portable fire-and-forget

00:06:45.039 --> 00:06:48.301
anti-tank missile. They begin assembling the
weapon.

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:55.930
Lisa flees the plane, removing her thin sweater
and tossing it into the trash, as security

00:06:55.930 --> 00:07:02.020
had already been alerted. She narrowly escapes
Rippner and airport security. Once outside,

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:06.148
she steals an SUV from a driver who was greeting
an arriving passenger.

00:07:08.935 --> 00:07:13.849
Lisa makes a call with Rippner's phone, noting
that it has a low-battery warning, so she's

00:07:13.849 --> 00:07:18.669
worried about that. However, she is able to
get through to Cynthia at the hotel, telling

00:07:18.669 --> 00:07:23.059
her what's going on, then ordering her to
pull the fire alarm and make sure to get the

00:07:23.059 --> 00:07:27.729
Keefe's out of their suite immediately. Cynthia
is freaking out, but she does exactly what

00:07:27.729 --> 00:07:29.050
Lisa told her to do.

00:07:31.616 --> 00:07:36.289
The Secret Service get the Secretary and his
family out of the room just seconds before

00:07:36.289 --> 00:07:41.490
the Javelin missile is fired. It races across
the sky and plows into the suite, exploding

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:46.379
and destroying the room and everything in
the immediate vicinity. Cynthia, the Keefes

00:07:46.379 --> 00:07:50.930
and the Secret Service agents all managed
to escape the room seconds before. The men

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:54.232
on the fishing boat toss their weapon overboard
and take off.

00:07:56.729 --> 00:08:02.110
Lisa, still driving, tries to call her father,
but the cell phone's battery dies just as

00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:06.819
he picks up the phone and says hello. She
rushes to her father's house, arriving to

00:08:06.819 --> 00:08:11.949
find the hit man standing just outside the
front door. He hears Lisa approach and turns

00:08:11.949 --> 00:08:17.729
to face her, reaching inside his jacket. Lisa
turns the SUV and floors the accelerator,

00:08:17.729 --> 00:08:22.422
jumping the curb and slamming into the hit
man, driving him through the front door, killing him.

00:08:24.768 --> 00:08:30.509
Lisa finds her father inside. He is shocked
not only by a vehicle slamming into his front

00:08:30.509 --> 00:08:35.399
door, but seeing a man lying on the entryway
and then his daughter walking in. He tells

00:08:35.399 --> 00:08:38.234
Lisa that he has already called 911.

00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:47.190
Lisa calls the hotel to check on things there.
Cynthia confirms the Keefes are ok. When Lisa

00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:52.610
turns around after talking with Cynthia, Rippner
is standing there. He'd knocked out her father,

00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:57.279
Joe, who was lying on the kitchen floor. Lisa
hurried to the kitchen to make sure her father

00:08:57.279 --> 00:09:02.269
was alive, then she turns her attention to
Rippner. She's really angry now, telling him

00:09:02.269 --> 00:09:07.235
that he'd failed at his mission and assuring
him that he's not about to defeat her in her own house.

00:09:09.853 --> 00:09:14.420
Over the course of the next few minutes, she
has the upper hand, as she throws things,

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:18.860
punches and kicks him as he chases her through
the house. He eventually returns to the body

00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:24.188
of the hit man and grabs the 12" K-Bar knife
that the man was going to kill Joe with.

00:09:26.128 --> 00:09:31.089
Lisa manages to make another phone call to
911 as she sneaks around trying to figure

00:09:31.089 --> 00:09:36.629
out where Rippner had disappeared to. As she
closes a bedroom door, intending to lock herself

00:09:36.629 --> 00:09:41.339
in, he is standing right there. They fight
some more and she clubs him with a stout cane

00:09:41.339 --> 00:09:45.860
she'd found in the closet, knocking the knife
away. He ends up throwing her down a flight

00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:51.100
of stairs. Lisa crawls down the last few steps,
where she sees a gun lying next to the dead

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:56.730
hit man. She grabs the gun and turns to threaten
Jackson with it. He moves towards her anyway

00:09:56.730 --> 00:10:01.480
and she shoots him, wounding him. He kicks
the gun out of her hand and grabs her by the

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:06.790
hair. He's about to kill her when Joe appears
and shouts, As Rippner pauses and looks up,

00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:08.250
Joe shoots him in the chest.

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:16.050
Lisa returns to the hotel where she greets
and hugs a very frazzled Cynthia. Cynthia

00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:20.300
observes that she thought things went pretty
well overall during Lisa's absence, other

00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:25.600
than the most recent event. The Homeland Secretary
expresses his gratitude to Lisa and Cynthia

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:27.034
before he's ushered off.

00:10:29.688 --> 00:10:34.240
An older man and woman, who'd been guests
at the hotel that day, come up to Lisa and

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:38.639
Cynthia, complaining about their terrible
stay, with all the inconvenience and discomfort

00:10:38.639 --> 00:10:42.990
associated with the attempted assassination,
wanting to know what Lisa was going to do

00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:47.730
about it. When Lisa asks them what they think
should be done, they say first they wanted

00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:52.510
Cynthia fired. Lisa thinks for a moment, then
suggests to the couple that they fill out

00:10:52.510 --> 00:10:57.279
a comment card. They are aghast at that, but
then they are totally speechless when Lisa

00:10:57.279 --> 00:11:02.119
tells them that after they are done with that,
to just go ahead and "shove it up your ass."

00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:07.899
The movie ends with Lisa taking Cynthia out
for a drink, 'anything but a bay breeze,'

00:11:07.899 --> 00:11:11.144
the kind of drink Lisa had mentioned drinking,
to Jackson.

00:11:12.178 --> 00:11:15.532
