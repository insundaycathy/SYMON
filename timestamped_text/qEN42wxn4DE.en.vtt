00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:13.440
Hi guys, Korean Movie Recapped here. Before we&nbsp;
start, WARNING! Spoilers Ahead! Today, I’m going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.680
to recap a 2019 Korean Action Comedy movie, called&nbsp;
The Dude In Me. This movie tells the story of an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.040
exchange of bodies between two men, a gangster&nbsp;
and a high school student. This incident brings&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:29.840
a huge difference in both their lives. So, will&nbsp;
they be able to return to their original body?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.520
How could they survive a different&nbsp;
life? Let’s find it out.
&nbsp;

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.720
On a sunny day, Jang, the gangster, goes&nbsp;
to grab some lunch at a ramen stall.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.320
For some reason, he doesn’t eat his food and asks&nbsp;
for the bill straightaway. He is also forced to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.360
pay for the food eaten by a student sitting next&nbsp;
to his table. After that, he drives somewhere.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.160
When he wants to cross a road, there are garbage&nbsp;
men collecting waste from the neighborhood.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:00.160
And that makes him unable to pass through. This is&nbsp;
where it all happens. When Jang is waiting for the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:06.160
garbage men, he decides to get out of the car to&nbsp;
call his assistant, Chul. At the same time, Kim,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:11.200
the high school student, is standing on the edge&nbsp;
of the rooftop. Then something unwanted happens,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.680
he falls from the rooftop and collides&nbsp;
with Jang. Both of them lost consciousness&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.680
and are taken to the hospital.
A moment later, Jang wakes up from his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.040
unconsciousness. He gets out of bed and walks&nbsp;
around the hallway. But, he finds something’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:30.640
wrong when everybody in the hospital calls him&nbsp;
kid or Kim. He is so confused, until he sees a man&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:36.480
laying on a bed next to his room. He recognizes&nbsp;
that man is him. When he looks at the mirror, he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:41.440
becomes more sure that he is living inside a kid’s&nbsp;
body. He keeps trying to convince everybody that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:47.360
he is not Kim. But, nobody believes him because&nbsp;
the doctor says that he has retrograde amnesia.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.000
He then tries to bump this kid’s body to his&nbsp;
actual body in order to swap back their bodies,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.200
but he fails. And when he is doing that, Chul gets&nbsp;
into the room and becomes angry when seeing this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.000
kid doing something inappropriate. Then, he is&nbsp;
told to stay away or else Chul will beat him.
&nbsp;

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.720
Knowing that Jang can do nothing to get his&nbsp;
body back, he is obliged to live as a high&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.840
school student. He lives as the new version&nbsp;
of Kim. The day he comes back to school,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.080
he experiences something he hasn’t&nbsp;
experienced before. He sees Hyeon,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:22.240
his friend, being bullied by a group of friends.&nbsp;
He is even being invited for a fight after school.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:27.520
But, this is not the Kim that everybody knows.&nbsp;
This is Kim with the heart of a gangster.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:32.160
He won’t hesitate to beat everybody up.&nbsp;
Jang becomes curious about why everybody&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.800
is treating him like a loser. So, he plans&nbsp;
to meet some bullies at a hill after school.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.640
He goes there with his friend, Jae. There, he asks&nbsp;
one of the bullies if there’s anything he has done&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:48.480
that makes them dislike him. The answer is no, the&nbsp;
reason is just because Jang looks like a loser.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.240
After getting the information that he wants,&nbsp;
Jang and his friend leave the bullies.
&nbsp;

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.480
After that, Jang decides to meet Chul&nbsp;
to convince him that he is his boss.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.960
He comes to the office where Chul works.&nbsp;
Chul doesn’t believe him at first.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:06.800
But, he knows how to get his assistant’s trust. He&nbsp;
tells everything that nobody knows about Chul, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:12.800
it works. Jang then asks Chul why he was guarding&nbsp;
his boss in the hospital. Then, a shocking truth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:17.840
comes out of Chul’s mouth. He says that CEO,&nbsp;
Jang’s competitor, is trying to kill him.
&nbsp;

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.680
The next day after school, Jang is on a call&nbsp;
with Chul. At the same time, Hyeon runs into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:29.200
him and drops a doll. He decides to return it&nbsp;
to her. When they finally meet, a startling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.480
moment happens. He sees that Hyeon’s mother&nbsp;
is his ex-girlfriend, Seon, who he dumped for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:40.240
another woman. Moments later, Jang asks Chul for&nbsp;
help to find out whether Hyeon is his daughter.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:45.840
They take Hyeon and Jang’s hair to test their DNA.&nbsp;
The result says that Hyeon is 99% his daughter.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.880
He starts feeling so guilty that he couldn’t&nbsp;
be a good guy for Seon and their daughter.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:56.960
So, he consults with Chul about what he can do to&nbsp;
approach Hyeon and Seon. He is told that he needs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:02.960
to change his appearance. So he plans to lose some&nbsp;
fat and groom himself. He first invites Hyeon to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:08.400
workout together with a trainer, who is actually&nbsp;
Chul. They consistently practise martial arts and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:14.480
jumping rope for months. Finally, he can see the&nbsp;
result. His body becomes lean and looks fresher.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:20.800
Lastly, he starts to groom himself. He&nbsp;
changes his hairstyle and uses a soft lens,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:26.400
so he doesn’t need to use his nerd eyeglasses. The&nbsp;
new look of Jang appears to be attractive. Many&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:31.520
girls start to like him. And Hyeon at the same&nbsp;
time, starts to gain respect from the bullies.
&nbsp;

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.120
Seon is so thankful to Jang because he always&nbsp;
protects her daughter. She invites Jang to her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:42.160
stall to eat ramen as a form of gratitude. When&nbsp;
they’re having a conversation, there comes a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:48.080
drunk guy who slaps Seon’s private area. Jang&nbsp;
becomes angry that he fights the drunk guy. At&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:53.840
that moment, Seon starts to suspect him. She sees&nbsp;
resemblance of Jang in Kim's words and actions.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:59.920
That makes Jang has to explain who he actually&nbsp;
is. He tells the story of how he switched bodies,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:05.680
but Seon doesn’t trust him. So he tries the same&nbsp;
thing he did to Chul. He tells everything he did&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:10.640
with Seon when they were still dating. Finally,&nbsp;
Seon believes that she is talking with the man&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:15.840
who left her. Seon becomes angry, she is so mad&nbsp;
that he hasn’t looked for her for a long time.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:20.240
She kicks Jang from her stall and tells&nbsp;
him to stay away from her daughter.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:25.520
The next day, Hyeon is sitting together with Jang&nbsp;
right after school. She asks about what he was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:30.720
talking about with her mother. Her curiosity arose&nbsp;
because her mom told her to not meet him anymore.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.040
While they are talking, one of the&nbsp;
student council approaches them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:38.240
He asks Hyeon if she wants to join&nbsp;
his birthday party at his villa.
&nbsp;

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:44.080
Hyeon accepts the invitation. She is happy&nbsp;
that an outcast like her could join the party.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:49.680
While at the same time, Jang is meeting Seon.&nbsp;
There, Jang plans to once again apologize for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:55.440
everything he has done. But, Seon thinks that&nbsp;
he can’t change anything. Seon has raised Hyeon&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:00.480
by herself and he doesn’t have any rights to take&nbsp;
care of her daughter. She also thinks that if this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:06.800
body exchange didn’t happen, he would never look&nbsp;
for her. So, she decides to leave Jang. But, as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:12.240
Seon is heading to the exit door, Jang chases her&nbsp;
and kisses her right on the lips. And that makes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:18.000
Seon angry, she slaps him and wants to drag him&nbsp;
to the police. When she is dragging Jang outside,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.400
Jang gets a call from Jae. Jae says&nbsp;
that Hyeon is in a bad situation,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:26.640
he was delivering meals to the girls that aren’t&nbsp;
invited to the party when he overheard that.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:32.560
Jang immediately leaves Seon and asks Chul to send&nbsp;
him a car. He then drives to where the party is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:38.880
held. There, he sees Hyeon is surrounded by the&nbsp;
boys. He can feel that Hyeon needs help. But,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:44.320
the boys don’t let Hyeon leave, because the party&nbsp;
has just begun. Jang and the boys start to fight.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:49.120
Luckily, both Jang and Hyeon have&nbsp;
learnt martial arts before. So they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:54.240
can beat all the boys up and leave the villa.
Jang is informed by Chul that Jang’s wife has an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:54.240 --> 00:07:00.480
affair with his competitor, CEO. So he writes&nbsp;
a letter to the chairman, his wife’s father. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:04.480
tells the chairman that he is the victim and&nbsp;
his wife has a conspiracy with another man.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:10.000
Suddenly, Kim wakes up from his coma. Kim&nbsp;
is now living inside the gangster body.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:15.680
Then, he gets back to his house and meets his&nbsp;
dad, Jeong. But Jeong doesn’t believe that he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:21.840
is his son. Fortunately, Jang gets back home&nbsp;
too. There, Jang and Kim meet for the first time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:27.200
after the collision. They explain to Jeong about&nbsp;
what has actually happened to them. After that,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:33.040
they agreed to help each other. They plan to meet&nbsp;
Seon at her stall. After they arrive, they lie to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:38.800
Seon that they have switched their body back. But,&nbsp;
CEO and his assistants get in the stall. They look&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:44.160
for Jang and try to kill him. Jang orders Kim&nbsp;
and Seon to hide in the kitchen. He wants to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:50.320
get this problem done. He fights with CEO and the&nbsp;
assistants. With Seon helping him, they succeed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:55.200
in throwing them out. Seon forgives Jang and is&nbsp;
willing to accept him to get back to her life.
&nbsp;

00:07:55.760 --> 00:08:00.480
The chairman invites Jang to his place. He&nbsp;
wants to clarify about the letter that he sent.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:04.800
Seeing that Jang is the victim, he&nbsp;
rather offers Jang to be his successor.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:11.040
But, Jang, who is actually Kim at that time,&nbsp;
refuses it because he has no idea what to say.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:17.360
When Jang meets Kim, he appreciates Jang for his&nbsp;
decision. He feels relieved that he no longer has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:23.840
to live a regretful criminal life. Unfortunately,&nbsp;
his wife plans to hit them. But, as Jang is aware&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:28.880
of the situation, he saves Kim and is hit by&nbsp;
the car. He is heavily injured and taken to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:34.080
hospital. When Jang is about to die, both Jang&nbsp;
and Kim suddenly switch their bodies back.
&nbsp;

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:40.000
At the end of this movie, we are shown that&nbsp;
Kim is still alive and Jang is back with Seon.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.240
Jang even bought a shop to build a bakery.&nbsp;
They all work there with Jeong and Chul.
