00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:13.040
Welcome to Slash Forward. In this episode we’re&nbsp;
going to explore the most realistic representation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:18.800
of what it would be like to live in a world where&nbsp;
ghosts were real, but only visible and available&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:24.560
to interact with when wearing a certain type of&nbsp;
specialty glasses. I am, of course, referring&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:30.880
to the 2001 cult favorite Thirteen Ghosts. After&nbsp;
losing his wife in a terrible house fire, Arthur&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:36.000
finds himself struggling to hang on and nearly&nbsp;
destitute despite the fact that he has two kids&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.520
and a hired nanny. Just when he needs it the most,&nbsp;
his estranged uncle comes to the rescue by dieing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.560
and bequeathing his vast estate to his favorite&nbsp;
nephew. The family goes to explore their new home,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:52.160
which inexplicably seems to have both plumbing&nbsp;
and electricity despite the fact that every wall,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.840
floor and ceiling is comprised of a single pane of&nbsp;
shatterproof glass. But it’s easy to be distracted&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.440
from this by all of the fantastic items contained&nbsp;
inside the house, and also by a particular number&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.720
of ghosts therein. As they unlock the mysteries&nbsp;
of this architectural abomination, will Arthur be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.200
able to navigate the various dangers that imperil&nbsp;
his children? That’s a rhetorical question,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.880
we’re going to find out as we go through it&nbsp;
now. Be sure to hit the like button as soon&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.960
as you see your favorite of the dirty dozen,&nbsp;
and leave a comment if you saw this movie at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.120
release and what your impression of it was. It&nbsp;
seems to be gaining more and more of a following&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.760
as time goes on, and I’m interested in how it&nbsp;
was perceived back in the day. Let’s get to it.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:35.040
We open in a warm and inviting junkyard and try&nbsp;
not to toss our cookies as they get creative with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.360
the camera work. The calm is interrupted by a&nbsp;
tanker truck busting through and leading the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.000
way for a caravan of very official looking&nbsp;
SUVs. An army of officials then pour out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.880
and start setting up equipment. As they do&nbsp;
so, rich-daddy Cyrus rolls up with Dennis,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.680
his subordinate who happens to be suffering a&nbsp;
pounding headache due to being in proximity to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.640
some ill-defined presence. We come to learn that&nbsp;
he has a power that has led them here in search&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.120
of the spectral version of a prolific,&nbsp;
and formerly corporeal, serial killer.

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:08.320
After pointing the way, they bring in the cube and&nbsp;
Dennis is put to work. Meanwhile Damon and Kalina,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:13.200
a couple of empathetic ghost hunters, are captured&nbsp;
nearby and brought in to be sneered at for their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.320
naive support of the post-life community. They&nbsp;
insist their spell book and a thirteenth ghost are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:24.640
prerequisites for success in whatever is going on&nbsp;
here, but Cyrus has a cube, sooo it’s all good.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.320
They also have a bait truck that drenches&nbsp;
the grounds in the blood of innocents.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.480
After the stage is set they start blasting&nbsp;
some Necronomicon over the loudspeakers.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.920
This sure does summon a ghostly presence, but&nbsp;
it’s to the detriment of the men’s skeletal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.880
composition. With the whole place&nbsp;
essentially falling apart, a single,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:46.640
brave nobody successfully lures the ghost into&nbsp;
the cube with the sacrifice of his own, juicy ass.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:52.640
Once closed, Dennis confirms capture. But at what&nbsp;
cost? Dead bodies are strewn about and Damon,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:58.000
that one guy we barely know, is dead alongside&nbsp;
Cyrus - the sponsor of this whole affair.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.960
We then transition to the most naively idyllic&nbsp;
representation of a brother/sister relationship&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:08.320
possible, which pans across remnants of an entire&nbsp;
lifetime of familial love and affection. Through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:13.440
voiceover we hear as it transitions to the chaotic&nbsp;
noises of a terrible house fire that results in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.880
Jean’s death, and leads to the house falling into&nbsp;
disrepair - a reflection of Arthur’s mental state.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.480
We emerge from this narrative at their new&nbsp;
apartment where Kathy has been pretty much&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.760
left solo to raise her bro, little Bobby. And this&nbsp;
is despite the fact that they have a live-in maid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.480
named Maggie to look after the house. They get&nbsp;
along as best they can and sure, they have their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.680
good moments, but are always one spilled cup of&nbsp;
coffee away from an outburst of unrestrained rage.

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.360
Ben Moss then arrives at their door&nbsp;
and, despite being a stranger to them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:46.560
is cordially invited in. As it turns out Cyrus&nbsp;
is Arthur’s estranged uncle, and Ben is the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:52.080
executor of his estate. They fire up his final&nbsp;
message on some sort of bespoke media player,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:57.840
and he confirms he has left them everything he has&nbsp;
- a key to a house, the one thing they need most.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.080
Quite a turn of good luck for these down and&nbsp;
out losers, which he hopes makes up for his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:09.760
absence in life. As they consider this, Bobby&nbsp;
the little death freak overshares as always.

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.600
Despite the secluded location, which would&nbsp;
keep them far from everything familiar,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.440
they at least go to check it out. And, in&nbsp;
a moment of excitement, they become giddy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:23.040
about how great life may be now. Meanwhile, up&nbsp;
ahead, Ben is driving along and serving up looks.

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.240
Elsewhere, Kalina is in her workshop&nbsp;
gathering up her collection of pipe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.400
bombs and magical artefacts before going&nbsp;
to go and see what’s up with Cyrus.

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:35.200
When the family arrives, they’re taken aback by&nbsp;
the postmodern facade of their new, glass house.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.440
Also, Dennis happens to be there in that&nbsp;
moment, pretending like he’s a power man&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:44.240
and claiming the home has caused widespread&nbsp;
power outages in the hope he may gain access.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.080
Ben has a black heart, but Arthur is&nbsp;
eager to show off his new home. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:52.960
he slides in his single-use key and sets&nbsp;
into motion some strange machinations.

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.840
With no walls, they get a little preview before&nbsp;
the foyer opens up and invites them in. Inside,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:03.520
they delight in examining all of uncle CC’s cool&nbsp;
and exotic items, wondering how much cash they may&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.280
be able to squeeze out of them. Dennis is given&nbsp;
direction to the breaker box in the basement,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.720
as Ben leads Arthur to the den so&nbsp;
they can handle the final paperwork.

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.240
Downstairs, it’s revealed through&nbsp;
self-exposition that Dennis is looking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:18.800
for a pile of money he suspects is down there.&nbsp;
But then some psychic strobing takes him off his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:23.040
goal by presenting some new information that&nbsp;
must be addressed. So he puts on his special&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:27.840
glasses and now sees that the glass chambers&nbsp;
each contain horrors from the beyond that,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:32.400
apparently, he also can’t hear or be&nbsp;
disturbed by when the glasses are off?

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:37.040
Upstairs Arthur hesitates to finalize the deed&nbsp;
as he’s worried about the tax obligations,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:41.520
even though he could also just sell the house.&nbsp;
But there is no need as Ben confirms that he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.920
will never again want for money. But then Dennis&nbsp;
interrupts the signing to explain to them in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:51.680
simple turns, that he is Dennis - the Dennis. His&nbsp;
uncle’s partner in hunting ghosts. The gravity of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:57.600
this revelation is still not quite landing, so he&nbsp;
promises to explain further once they get outside.

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:01.440
Unfortunately, the rest of the gang has already&nbsp;
scattered, going each in their own direction&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:05.040
to scout out their new surroundings&nbsp;
and call dibs on the various rooms.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:08.960
Kathy finds the princess suite, filled&nbsp;
with only the best fragrances and all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:12.800
the finest oils and liniments. This&nbsp;
could not be any more perfect for her.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:17.920
Meanwhile, Dennis continues to insist the home&nbsp;
is dangerous, but then keels over and creams his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:22.800
pants as Arthur consistently refuses to decline&nbsp;
to touch him. Demonstrating that for Dennis,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:27.840
the true danger is man. Once he finishes, they&nbsp;
look around and discover that Ben is now gone.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:31.840
He’s heading into the basement on his own with&nbsp;
some special glasses so he can say what up to some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:37.040
ghosts and then grab the money case. Although the&nbsp;
case is, to his detriment, on a pressure pad that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:42.160
causes the house to begin manipulating itself in&nbsp;
mysterious ways. Once everything lines up just so,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:47.360
it releases one ghost. The timing for Ben could&nbsp;
not be worse, and he attempts to remove himself&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:51.680
from this situation by backing up slowly,&nbsp;
but retreats only halfway between a pair&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:57.840
of sturdy glass doors with no impact detection -&nbsp;
resulting in a full, vertical bodily bifurcation.

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:02.000
As Arthur and Dennis go searching, the rest of&nbsp;
them go about their business completely unaware&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.920
that all around them is blood and&nbsp;
death. This becomes very precarious&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:09.760
as Kathy is saved just before she&nbsp;
completely interrupts tubby time.

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:13.440
The adults all group up, then go off in&nbsp;
search of Bobby, who is summoned into the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:17.680
basement by one disembodied voice, but then&nbsp;
told to go back by another. Rightly confused&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:21.680
by the fact that the glasses help him hear&nbsp;
things, he goes down to see what he can see.

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:24.800
Upstairs the adults take a quick&nbsp;
detour to see if they can even get out,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:29.360
and find out that they can not. They also find&nbsp;
out that Dennis brought a backup suit with him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:34.240
just in case his ruse failed and he wanted to&nbsp;
be more comfortable and stylish. Due to his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:38.720
special abilities and potential knowledge of this&nbsp;
place, Arthur insists he stick with the group.

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:44.080
Back downstairs, there are all kinds of rooms&nbsp;
opening all over. Bobby seems to have an innate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:49.120
understanding of the situation. And, with his&nbsp;
love for and fascination with all things dead,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:54.000
he ventures ahead fearlessly. Until he sees how&nbsp;
gross they can be. This sends him racing off&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.400
through a funhouse of horrors, and he eventually&nbsp;
clips a corner and winds up unconscious.

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:03.200
Meanwhile, Dennis explains for our benefit that&nbsp;
ghosts are beholden to certain types of spells,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:05.840
which are inscribed on the&nbsp;
various walls and surfaces&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:10.160
all around them. He also explains the basement&nbsp;
situation and establishes the employment of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:14.960
special specs that are necessary to see the&nbsp;
ghosts. Arthur doesn't really care for this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:19.200
particular brand of bullshit, and tries&nbsp;
to keep him focused on the task at hand.

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:23.760
Bobby comes to some time later to a voice&nbsp;
telling him to put on his glasses. When he does,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:28.320
he sees his mom approaching, but she’s&nbsp;
all burned up. Then Cyrus does something.

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:32.720
Due to the size of the house Arthur recommends&nbsp;
splitting up into two groups to cover more ground&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:36.000
while, invisible to them, stuff&nbsp;
inside the house keeps spinning.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.320
Dennis notes the curious fact that more&nbsp;
doors are now open, and then uses the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:45.360
glasses to reveal the reality of ghosts existing&nbsp;
to Maggie, which she honestly takes pretty well,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:49.040
all things considered. Of course, her&nbsp;
attitude sours when they find themselves&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:53.760
dealing with a creepy young lad and a cut up&nbsp;
naked lady, both of whom they narrowly avoid.

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:59.040
Elsewhere, Arthur and Kathy find Bobby’s recorder&nbsp;
and glasses. The recorder only confirms that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:03.200
he may have died screaming, but they put that&nbsp;
thought out of their minds. Kathy puts on her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:08.080
bro’s glasses at just the right time to impose&nbsp;
upon Arthur the actual existence of ghosts,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:12.800
but at just the wrong time to avoid getting&nbsp;
mauled. As she’s dragged around and ravaged,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:16.640
Kalina appears at just the right time to&nbsp;
scare off their ethereal attacker with a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:21.360
road flare - a ghost’s only weakness. This&nbsp;
allows Kathy to be dragged again, but for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:25.360
her own good this time, and they eventually&nbsp;
arrive safely behind a wall of protection.

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:29.600
With a moment to breathe, Kalina introduces&nbsp;
herself and grants Arthur the gift of sight.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:34.320
She explains Cyrus’s efforts as the enslavement&nbsp;
of souls, which she intends to reverse by setting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:39.680
them all free. She also confirms she infiltrated&nbsp;
the edifice through a shifting hole that has since&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:43.600
closed up. She further explains to them that&nbsp;
their new house is actually not a house at all,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:47.200
but a large machine created from a&nbsp;
fifteenth century book that was written&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:53.120
under influence of the devil himself. It’s purpose&nbsp;
*I don’t give a shit* touche. Also, Kathy is now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:57.600
gone and the boy’s here, but he doesn’t know&nbsp;
Kalina intends to free him, so they must run.

00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:01.520
As the house continues to shift, Maggie&nbsp;
inadvertently gets separated from Dennis,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:04.800
locking him in a box sans&nbsp;
glasses. While he’s in there,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:09.520
he is assaulted by a dead greaser armed with&nbsp;
a sparkle bat. But after avoiding major injury&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:13.360
for a few minutes, he’s eventually provided&nbsp;
the opportunity to tuck and roll his way out.

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:16.960
While that’s going on Arthur and Kalina&nbsp;
hit a dead end, and then are horrified to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:21.440
find that this house contains ghosts. With&nbsp;
few spots downstairs free of apparitions,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:24.240
Kalina suggests they make for&nbsp;
the well-protected liberry.

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:27.760
Dennis and Maggie have a similar thought&nbsp;
about the potential safety of being&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:32.000
upstairs, but are horrified to find there are&nbsp;
ghosts up there as well. But it’s all good,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.680
because baby Huey and his grandma sister don’t&nbsp;
have the cardio to keep up. In their retreat,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:41.360
they are finally reunited with the&nbsp;
others. Feeling safety in numbers,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:46.160
they drop their guard a bit, resulting in Arthur&nbsp;
assuming the position and getting his back raked.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:50.240
They toss another flickerstick to free him,&nbsp;
and conclude the final leg of their journey.

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:54.320
Finally safe, they blow off some steam&nbsp;
by arguing about who did what to whom,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:59.120
etc. - before Arthur commands their attention&nbsp;
and insists they get back to a solution-oriented&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:04.160
dialogue. But then Kalina reveals to him that the&nbsp;
fourth ghost is the spirit of his precious wife.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:08.560
She then takes him through the rogue’s gallery,&nbsp;
explaining that the machine releases the ghosts,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:14.080
then draws them in to use their energy to unlock&nbsp;
the Occularis - an object that grants its wielder&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:18.720
ultimate knowledge. The thirteenth ghost is&nbsp;
a failsafe required to shut it down - a ghost&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:23.040
resulting from the willing sacrifice of a&nbsp;
life out of pure love. That’s you Artie,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:26.800
you get to sacrifice yourself! But Dennis&nbsp;
insists there must be another way out of this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:31.280
and convinces him to make one last attempt to&nbsp;
go out into the haunted house to find his kids.

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:34.880
Approaching this rationally, they grab&nbsp;
a wall of protection to help them along&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:39.840
while Kalina and Maggie go to set some explosive&nbsp;
charges. They each venture deep into the machine,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:43.440
slowly and carefully. Soon Kalina&nbsp;
finds the heart of the beast - the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:47.120
gravity drive. Then a ghost joins them and&nbsp;
Kalina goes to swat at it with her book,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:52.160
but appears to have poor aim...until the double&nbsp;
cross is revealed. She’s excited to be reunited,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:55.200
but Cyrus is like get off me&nbsp;
woman, I needs m’ spell book.

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:59.440
Elsewhere the boys find themselves in a&nbsp;
dire situation. Upon approach of a ghost,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:03.920
Dennis lodges the door in a corner with only&nbsp;
room for one of them. So Arthur is wedged in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:08.000
there and forced to watch as Dennis gets&nbsp;
all smashed up and cranked across a pole.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.520
At the spinning floor portion of the&nbsp;
machine Cyrus gets to work on the spells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:15.520
while Kalina imperils the kids in an&nbsp;
attempt to compel Arthur’s sacrifice&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:19.840
as the thirteenth ghost is actually needed&nbsp;
to initiate the machine, not stop it. As&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:25.040
this final phase begins the ghosts all leave,&nbsp;
but not before Jean gets in one last goodbye.

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:28.400
Now that they’re all prepped up, Cyrus&nbsp;
double crosses the double crosser,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:33.040
just to tie off any loose ends. He then arrives&nbsp;
at the big show where all the machine stuff starts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:36.480
happening, and Bobby’s there - remember&nbsp;
him? Artie has a face off with his uncle,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:41.040
recapping in his mind all the rules that were laid&nbsp;
out for him and counting off the twelve ghosts.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:44.960
Recognizing that if he is to be the&nbsp;
thirteenth ghost, that can only mean….

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.280
They then have a disagreement about&nbsp;
who will fulfill that role and,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:52.880
before reaching common ground, Maggie&nbsp;
distracts them on the ones and twos.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:57.440
With the spells no longer running and her flipping&nbsp;
switches like crazy, the machine disengages,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:00.880
freeing the spirits and allowing them&nbsp;
to take revenge against their master.

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:05.680
Ghost Dennis then appears to provide some causal&nbsp;
encouragement to Arthur, who times things just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:10.400
right and jumps out to his children in order to&nbsp;
save them. Very impressive. Although, it’s not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:15.200
clear to me how him being there changes anything.&nbsp;
The machine then falls apart around them, and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:20.240
ghosts return to the world. Except Jean - they&nbsp;
have a brief staring contest with their ghost mom.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:25.280
When she loses, she’s banished to hell. Finally,&nbsp;
just to make sure the movie ends on an up beat,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:30.960
we transition to credits as Maggie lets us all&nbsp;
know exactly how she’s feeling. No punches pulled!

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:35.920
Thirteen Ghosts did not receive critical acclaim&nbsp;
when it was released. And I get that. It has huge&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:40.960
expositional dump outs, and sometimes jumps from&nbsp;
one thing to another in order to do what it wants&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:45.520
rather than doing what makes sense. A couple of&nbsp;
examples of this would be Dennis’s costume change,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:50.400
or the inconsistent way they utilized the glasses&nbsp;
- you can’t see the ghosts without the glasses,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:53.600
but even when they’re on they&nbsp;
seem to blink in and out. Also,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:57.760
people seem to be unaffected by noises the&nbsp;
ghosts make or being physically manipulated&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:02.000
by the ghosts until they put glasses on, but&nbsp;
then don’t always need to have the glasses&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.080
on for these things to take effect. The&nbsp;
movie is inconsistent with its own rules

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:11.040
Even so, this film is mostly here to have fun and&nbsp;
I can see why it is now so highly regarded as a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:15.120
cult favorite. If you were younger when you caught&nbsp;
this one, it would be like a visual carnival for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:20.240
the senses. It has a Mummy/Tomb Raider vibe and&nbsp;
comes across like a Disney Haunted Mansion movie,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:26.080
but rated R so it has extensive gore and adult&nbsp;
themes. Also, it has Shannon Elizabeth and Matthew&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:30.560
Lillard, automatically making it an extremely&nbsp;
“product of the time it was made” type of movie,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:34.400
which means it’s going to hold some pretty&nbsp;
deep-running nostalgic roots for people.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:38.320
Hey, I recently bought a box set of Chuck&nbsp;
Norris action movies that I remember running&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:42.160
during Saturday matinees on a local station&nbsp;
when I was younger, so who am I to judge?

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:58.320
Before we go, I’d like to give a huge thanks to&nbsp;
my donors, memorialized in the hall of headshots.

00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:00.560
I have a website set up where you&nbsp;
can support the channel through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:05.040
donations or merch. Any donation unlocks&nbsp;
uncensored movie reviews of Lifeforce,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:09.440
Under the Skin and Possessor, with others to&nbsp;
be added over time. If you enjoyed the video,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:14.560
I’d love for you to become a part of the&nbsp;
channel by subscribing. Thanks for watching.
