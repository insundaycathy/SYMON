00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.320
Hey everyone. Welcome back to&nbsp;
Movie Recap. My name is Silverra.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.835
Today I'm gonna show you a 2017 action&nbsp;
thriller superhero film called, Logan.

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:22.400
Logan, formerly the Wolverine, wakes up in the&nbsp;
back of a limo, groggy and disheveled. It's the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.840
middle of the night. He stumbles out and finds a&nbsp;
Mexican gang trying to steal the limo's wheels.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.040
Logan calmly attempts to intervene but one of&nbsp;
the gang members blasts him with a shotgun.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.360
Standing up, Logan reveals his claws,&nbsp;
an act that is evidently painful,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.800
but one doesn't extend all the way. He fights the&nbsp;
gang, receiving his share of abuse as they beat&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.600
him down, but manages to brutally maim and&nbsp;
kill most of them before the rest run away.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:57.200
The year is 2029. Looking no older than 50, Logan&nbsp;
has still aged to over 170 years and is no longer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:02.640
the same fighter he once was. His superhuman&nbsp;
healing ability is failing and the adamantium&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.720
in his body is slowly killing him. As a result,&nbsp;
his body aches and he coughs up blood on occasion.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:14.480
Mutants are on the brink of extinction and no&nbsp;
new ones have been born in 25 years. Logan now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:19.360
makes a living driving for a limo service in&nbsp;
El Paso, Texas under his birth name, James&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.927
Howlett. He also carries an adamantium bullet&nbsp;
with him in case he ever decides to end it all.

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:32.080
While he waits for a client at a funeral, he&nbsp;
is approached by a woman named Gabriela Lopez.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.720
She claims to know who he is and asks&nbsp;
for his help, but Logan turns her away.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.480
Gabriela drives off as a young girl&nbsp;
in the back seat stares at Logan.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.960
One morning a man enters Logan's limo, introducing&nbsp;
himself as Donald Pierce. He appears to know much&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.000
about Logan, saying he's aware of his unofficial&nbsp;
participation in the killing of the gang members&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.360
and alludes to Logan's side job as caretaker&nbsp;
for one Charles Xavier just south of the border.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.520
Pierce says he knows Logan was contacted&nbsp;
by a person of interest and claims that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:09.200
he only wants what Gabriela has; something she&nbsp;
took from him. He hands Logan a card and tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.720
him to call when he finds Gabriela again. The&nbsp;
card reads that Donald is head of security at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:20.399
'Alkali-Transigen', a biotechnological&nbsp;
corporation. Logan drives off, furious. 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.360
Logan heads into Mexico to an abandoned plant&nbsp;
where he and the clairvoyant mutant Caliban, an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:33.120
albino psychic, are taking care of Xavier. Charles&nbsp;
has been reduced to a shell of his former self,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.520
crippled and suffering from a degenerative&nbsp;
brain disease which produces seizures.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:42.640
Thanks to his mutation, the seizures produce&nbsp;
staggering psionic blasts which paralyze anyone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:48.240
within reach. Logan must administer a special&nbsp;
serum to keep Xavier's episodes under control,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:53.600
though the doses often leave him confused and&nbsp;
senile. Xavier has become broken since the loss&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:59.040
of his school and fellow X-Men some time ago and&nbsp;
says that Logan is just waiting for him to die.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.680
Logan argues with Caliban about&nbsp;
obtaining enough medicine for Xavier.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.760
Caliban explains that it's hard caring&nbsp;
for Xavier, especially when Logan won't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.760
communicate about his own needs which&nbsp;
are more than evident to the albino.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:19.280
Logan storms off. Later he receives a notification&nbsp;
for two passengers and drives to a motel.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:25.015
There, he comes across Gabriela again with the&nbsp;
young girl whom Gabriela says is her 11 year&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.015 --> 00:03:30.800
old daughter, Laura. She offers Logan $50,000&nbsp;
to help them reach a place called 'Eden' in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.760
North Dakota en route to Canada before handing&nbsp;
him an envelope with coordinates written on it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:41.760
and $20,000 inside. Logan reluctantly&nbsp;
agrees and heads home to prepare. There,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.480
he tells Xavier that their dream of leaving&nbsp;
and buying a boat may actually become reality.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.760
However, when he returns to the motel,&nbsp;
he finds that Gabriela has been murdered&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.640
and Laura is missing. Logan takes Gabriela's&nbsp;
cell phone and finds she was in the process&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:03.200
of sending him a text telling him to hurry&nbsp;
as they've been found. Logan returns home,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.000
dejected, but is stunned to find that Laura&nbsp;
has stowed away in the trunk of his limo.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Xavier excitedly hosts the young girl and tries to&nbsp;
convince Logan that she needs their help. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:20.080
Logan correctly predicts that she'll be found and,&nbsp;
soon enough, Pierce comes knocking at their door.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:25.680
Logan claims Laura is not there and, when Pierce&nbsp;
persists, Laura throws a pipe at his head,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:31.120
knocking him out. Logan tells Caliban to take&nbsp;
Pierce out into the desert and leave him there.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:36.240
Caliban dresses heavily to protect his sensitive&nbsp;
skin from the sun and carts Pierce's body away,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:42.240
but a squad of elites from Transigen, the Reavers,&nbsp;
arrive. They pick up Pierce and capture Caliban.

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:50.240
The Reavers return to the plant and two enter to&nbsp;
retrieve Laura, who is calmly eating a bowl of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:55.840
cereal, while Logan and the others wait outside.&nbsp;
They all hear commotion from inside, including&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:01.120
screams and gunfire. Laura appears, throwing&nbsp;
the head of one of the Reavers at Pierce's feet.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:05.440
She then steps forward, producing two&nbsp;
adamantium claws from each of her hands&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:10.880
and one from each foot and viciously attacks the&nbsp;
Reavers. A stunned Logan finally helps her fight&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:15.920
and flees the scene in the limo with Xavier and&nbsp;
Laura in the backseat. Caliban is taken by the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:20.960
Reavers and tortured with sunlight in order to&nbsp;
get him to use his powers to track the trio.

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:29.520
Logan demands to know who Laura is and Xavier&nbsp;
responds that she is very much like him. Logan&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:34.720
looks through Gabriela's phone for clues and finds&nbsp;
a video which reveals that she used to work for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:40.160
Transigen in the genetics department. However,&nbsp;
the phone dies before the video can finish.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:45.280
They stop at a convenience store to stock up&nbsp;
on supplies. The clerk attempts to stop Laura&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:50.400
from shoplifting some chips and sunglasses but&nbsp;
she easily flips him over and nearly claws him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:56.240
before Logan intervenes, saying "Not okay". He&nbsp;
then takes a phone charger and cigar and leaves.

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:05.120
That night, as the phone charges, Logan watches&nbsp;
the rest of Gabriela's video. She had documented&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:10.640
her role as a nurse in the genetic experimentation&nbsp;
of new mutant children, led by Dr. Zander Rice,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:15.680
with the intention of turning them into&nbsp;
super soldiers. Using DNA from known mutants,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:20.320
most of whom were deceased, the children were&nbsp;
conceived and born to anonymous mothers who would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:26.880
not be missed. The children, including Laura, were&nbsp;
dubbed X-23 and raised under harsh conditions.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:32.560
Simple pleasures, such as birthdays, were frowned&nbsp;
upon. The experiment was deemed a failure due to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:37.920
the fact that the children sustained too much&nbsp;
emotion and often refused to follow orders.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:42.720
With the introduction of X-24, it was&nbsp;
decided the children would be terminated.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:47.360
Rather than see them killed, Gabriela helped&nbsp;
orchestrate an escape and the location of Eden&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:52.720
was designated as a safe point so the children&nbsp;
could live free in Canada. In the video's final&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:57.760
moments, Gabriela admits that she is not&nbsp;
Laura's mother but loves her all the same.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:01.440
Addressing Logan, she apologizes&nbsp;
for lying about the total fee&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:05.920
that she would pay him but hopes that, as&nbsp;
her biological father, he will keep her safe.

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:14.560
The trio enter Oklahoma City and take residence&nbsp;
in a hotel where Logan discovers that Laura has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:20.000
been reading an X-Men comic book. He finds that&nbsp;
the coordinates to Eden are included in the book&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:26.240
and is convinced that the whole trip is a charade.&nbsp;
Angry, he confronts Laura to Xavier's disdain and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:31.520
tells her the X-Men stories she's been reading&nbsp;
are fantasized and that Eden does not exist.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:36.320
Logan leaves Xavier and Laura in their room&nbsp;
and goes downstairs where he sees that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:42.640
Reavers have followed them. Suddenly, everyone&nbsp;
becomes paralyzed and Logan realizes Xavier is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:47.600
suffering another seizure. Having ever been the&nbsp;
only one able to partially resist the effects,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:51.200
Logan struggles to make it back to&nbsp;
the room where some of the Reavers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:57.040
have already found Laura and Xavier. Logan kills&nbsp;
them all before injecting Xavier with his serum,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:00.160
ending the paralysis, and the&nbsp;
three escape in a new vehicle.

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:08.320
On the road, a report goes over the incident in&nbsp;
Oklahoma City and relates the similarity to an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:13.680
event that occurred in Westchester one year prior,&nbsp;
but Logan turns off the radio. They are nearly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:18.400
run off the road by a robotic freight truck and&nbsp;
swerve to avoid a pickup hauling a trailer full&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:24.720
of horses. Xavier convinces Logan to help and uses&nbsp;
his telepathic powers to bring the horses back.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:30.400
The driver introduces himself as Will Munson&nbsp;
accompanied by his wife Kathryn and son Nate.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:34.480
Logan then helps push their pickup&nbsp;
out of a ditch. Kathryn offers Logan&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:38.397
and his 'family' to have dinner with&nbsp;
them which Xavier happily accepts.

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:46.160
Logan is eager to leave immediately after dinner&nbsp;
but Kathryn offers them to spend the night as it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:51.840
late. Logan only agrees for Xavier's sake and&nbsp;
carries him upstairs to bed. Seeing that their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:57.680
water supply has been tampered with, Will goes&nbsp;
out to investigate and Logan tags along. They find&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:02.800
and fix the obvious leak at the pump some distance&nbsp;
away and are confronted by a group of thugs led by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:08.480
a man who owns the land. He harasses Will, saying&nbsp;
he's been skimping on payments, but Logan hits&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:13.200
one of the thugs in the face with his own rifle&nbsp;
and breaks it over his knee, scaring them off.

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:21.600
Back at the house, Xavier lies in bed and senses&nbsp;
Logan entering the room. He tearfully pleads&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:26.880
with him to be patient with Laura, asleep on the&nbsp;
floor beside him, and expresses regret and remorse&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:32.320
over what happened a year ago. It is implied that&nbsp;
Xavier suffered a massive seizure at his school in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:37.920
Westchester which resulted in the deaths of most&nbsp;
of the X-Men. He apologizes but Logan pushes his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:43.680
claws through Xavier's chest. Laura attacks in&nbsp;
Charles' defense. The attacker turns out to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:49.760
a mindless and merciless clone of Logan, the X-24.&nbsp;
The mutant abducts Laura and slaughters Nate and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:56.320
Kathryn. Upon returning, Will is struck down by&nbsp;
the X-24 and Logan rushes upstairs to get Xavier&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:56.320 --> 00:10:02.450
who is just barely alive. Logan consoles him,&nbsp;
"It wasn't me", as he carries him downstairs.

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:10.745
Outside, the Reavers wait with Pierce and Dr.&nbsp;
Rice. Caliban is confined in a surveillance van.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:15.920
The thugs who abused Will before arrive at the&nbsp;
house in retaliation for their earlier humiliation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:22.240
but X-24 kills them all. Logan sets Xavier down in&nbsp;
the bed of a pickup truck. Charles utters the name&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:28.960
of their boat and dies. Bereaved, Logan engages&nbsp;
X-24 in a furious fight. Meanwhile, Caliban&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:33.760
fights back against his captors and sets off two&nbsp;
grenades, muttering the phrase his mother once&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:39.120
told him: "Beware the light." The van explodes&nbsp;
and Pierce is thrown out while Rice escapes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:47.680
Logan is nearly overpowered by the X-24 until&nbsp;
Will rams into the mutant with his truck,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:52.880
pinning him against some farm equipment.&nbsp;
Will repeatedly shoots X-24 with a shotgun&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:58.400
and then turns the gun on Logan. The gun is&nbsp;
out of shots and Will collapses, dead. Logan&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:03.600
retrieves Laura and takes her with Xavier's&nbsp;
body and drives away. The following morning,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:08.960
Dr. Rice and his crew take care of the scene&nbsp;
and inject X-24 with an agent to help him heal.

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:15.920
Logan buries Charles in an unmarked&nbsp;
grave in the woods while Laura watches.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:21.760
Afterwards, he goes back to their truck and begins&nbsp;
smashing it in fury before passing out. Later,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:27.360
Logan wakes up in a clinic. The doctor tells Logan&nbsp;
he knows he's a mutant and says he wants to help&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:33.200
him, aware that the adamantium in his body is&nbsp;
killing him. Logan refuses and leaves with Laura.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:38.480
He begrudgingly thanks her and she finally speaks&nbsp;
by responding 'you're welcome' in Spanish. Logan&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:43.520
is perplexed as to why she never spoke before,&nbsp;
but Laura begins rattling in Spanish the names&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:48.560
of her friends from Transigen. She tells Logan&nbsp;
they must meet up with them in Eden and presses&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:56.240
him with such persistence that Logan finally&nbsp;
concedes, but only to prove Eden doesn't exist.

00:11:56.240 --> 00:12:01.200
The two just barely make it and Logan is drained&nbsp;
to the point of unconsciousness, so much that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:06.720
Laura had to drive the remaining miles there. At&nbsp;
a cliff, a lift is dropped for Logan so they can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:12.160
ascend and he and Laura are finally able to rest&nbsp;
along with the remaining children led by Rictor.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:17.520
The kids prank Logan by shaving his beard in his&nbsp;
sleep to more closely resemble how he looked in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:23.440
his youth, but Logan is not amused. Rictor gives&nbsp;
Logan a serum that was used on them in Transigen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:29.440
to help him re-energize and heal, but he warns&nbsp;
Logan not to use it all at once. Logan then tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:34.480
Laura that he's done his job in delivering her&nbsp;
to Eden and emotionally explains that everyone he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:40.000
cares about dies and it's better he leaves. Laura&nbsp;
bitterly responds that she should be fine, then.

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:47.200
In the morning, the children are gone&nbsp;
and Logan is about to leave when he sees&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:52.320
that the Reavers have caught up to them, tracking&nbsp;
the children. Logan runs to intercept them as the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:58.480
Reavers pick off the children one by one. Despite&nbsp;
using their powers, the children are outnumbered.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:03.520
Injecting all of the healing agent at once,&nbsp;
Logan kills most of the Reavers and confronts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:08.480
Dr. Rice who has rounded up the children and&nbsp;
is holding them at gunpoint. Rice reveals&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:13.600
that he is actually the son of the man killed by&nbsp;
Wolverine when he escaped the Weapon X project.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:19.200
Rice admits responsibility for the extinction of&nbsp;
mutants thanks to a virus developed by Transigen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:24.320
that was seeped into food supplies. Before he can&nbsp;
continue, Logan shoots him dead in a desperate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:30.960
move and goes after Pierce. However, X-24 is&nbsp;
released and Logan fights his clone once more.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:35.600
Seeing that Pierce is in complete control&nbsp;
of X-24, the children gang up on him and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:41.438
use their collective powers (electrocution,&nbsp;
freezing, plant manipulation, etc.) to kill him.

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:48.000
As the healing agent in Logan's body&nbsp;
wears off, he becomes overpowered&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.960
by his younger clone until X-24 finally&nbsp;
impales Logan on a dead tree limb.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:57.920
Laura then uses the adamantium bullet Logan&nbsp;
carried with him to shoot X-24 in the head,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:02.000
obliterating it. She runs to Logan&nbsp;
and cuts him down from the tree,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.800
but Logan's wounds aren't healing. Logan&nbsp;
tearfully tells Laura to run with the others;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:12.320
they're free. She cries, calling him 'Daddy' and&nbsp;
Logan responds, "So, this is what it feels like"&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:17.680
before he dies. The children bury Logan and raise&nbsp;
a cross at the head of the grave as Laura recites&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:23.360
from a Western, the movie Shane 1953, that&nbsp;
she and Xavier watched in the Oklahoma hotel:

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:29.465
The children then leave, their&nbsp;
future uncertain but free.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:34.000
Laura takes the cross on Logan's grave&nbsp;
and tilts it sideways, to look like an X.

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:40.320
Thanks for watching. See&nbsp;
you in another Movie Recap.
