00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.760
Story Recapped here. Today&nbsp;
I'm going to explain a crime,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:08.960
drama, and thriller film called “Sleep Tight."&nbsp;
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.520
&nbsp;
At the edge of an apartment building,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:17.040
a concierge named Cesar contemplates how he is&nbsp;
unable to find any source of happiness no matter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:22.160
how much he tries to search for it. Despite having&nbsp;
good things happen to him, he remains restless&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.360
and dissatisfied with the life he’s living.&nbsp;
At exactly 5 A.M, he wakes up beside Clara,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:33.120
a tenant of the building, and goes about his daily&nbsp;
routine of working at the building. At the lobby,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.400
Cesar secretly hands money to Ursula, a tenant’s&nbsp;
daughter, which seems like a usual thing between&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:44.320
the two. By the entrance, Clara and Cesar also&nbsp;
stumble upon Veronica, another tenant who is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.920
fond of her dogs. After greeting the elderly lady,&nbsp;
Clara reminds Cesar that her sink is clogged and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.040
needs immediate repair, to which he replies that&nbsp;
he will drop by to fix it. Throughout the day,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.840
Cesar continues working before&nbsp;
visiting his mother at the hospital.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.440
Because of her condition, she is unable to speak&nbsp;
and is completely immobile, but she listens to him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.080
talk about Clara whenever he pays a visit.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.640
Back at the building, the supervisor scolds&nbsp;
Cesar for being late for two consecutive days.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.480
He tries to defend himself, but the supervisor&nbsp;
gets more irritated. Their conversation is cut&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:21.280
short when Veronica appears, asking Cesar a&nbsp;
favor. She needs someone to look after her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.840
dogs while she attends a birthday party, giving&nbsp;
detailed instructions on how to feed her pets.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.040
Cesar agrees and proceeds to Veronica’s apartment&nbsp;
after entrusting the office keys to the cleaning&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.480
lady and her son. He feeds the dogs their food,&nbsp;
but contrary to the old lady’s instructions,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.840
he adds a slice of pie to the one named Rocio.
&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.320
Meanwhile, Clara arrives at her place where she&nbsp;
opens several letters which she then throws away.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.520
She continues the night by dancing around all&nbsp;
while Cesar hides under her bed unnoticed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.840
He patiently waits for her to fall asleep and&nbsp;
uses a mirror to make sure that she is completely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:59.520
unconscious. He then uses chloroform on Clara,&nbsp;
making sure she goes into a deep sleep. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.280
uncovers her sheets to look at her underwear&nbsp;
before heading to the bathroom to mess with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.400
her toiletries. He adds an unknown substance to&nbsp;
her care products using a syringe before laying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.240
with Clara in bed.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:16.240
Again, at 5 A.M, Cesar wakes up to go about his&nbsp;
routine, even using Clara’s personal supplies.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.960
When he leaves, Ursula stands outside telling&nbsp;
him she will not let anyone know about Cesar’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:26.000
doings if he provides her with an explicit adult&nbsp;
movie. Without a choice, he makes a deal with the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.360
little girl to conceal his dirty deeds. That day,&nbsp;
Veronica walks into the lobby with only one dog,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.640
so Cesar asks what happened to Rocio, and she&nbsp;
explains that the dog currently has diarrhea.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.280
As part of his work, he inserts mail into the&nbsp;
tenants’ mailboxes and even adds several letters&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.560
in Clara’s box, revealing that he has been the one&nbsp;
sending the mysterious letters. In Clara’s room,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.280
Clara continuously uses the care products&nbsp;
without knowing that Cesar has gone through them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.760
When she arrives at the lobby, she asks Cesar if&nbsp;
he has seen a watch that seems to be missing in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.880
her apartment, but he denies that he has. However,&nbsp;
he lets her know that she will be informed if he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.160
ever sees it.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.320
Later that day, while Cesar writes more&nbsp;
letters, Ursula sneaks out of school to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.880
ask for the adult movie which he hands to her.&nbsp;
She also tells him that she has grown closer to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.440
Clara in the past few days and that the price&nbsp;
for her being quiet will now be at 100 euros.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.280
Cesar is impressed but annoyed with the kid’s&nbsp;
extortion abilities. He then shoos her away. At&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.920
the lobby, the supervisor scolds him once more for&nbsp;
not tending to the plants that led them to die.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.720
He becomes successful at angering another tenant&nbsp;
because of this, not to mention the growing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.600
frustration of his supervisor toward him. Cesar&nbsp;
tells it to his mother who he visits again that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:40.720
day. He also adds that he is almost successful&nbsp;
in his aim to wipe Clara’s smile off her face&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.400
because he wishes to make his tenants frustrated—a&nbsp;
goal he has been working on for quite some time.&nbsp;

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.400
&nbsp;
That night, Cesar informs the cleaning lady&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.880
that the main office was not cleaned which leads&nbsp;
the cleaner’s son to trouble, despite Cesar’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:58.400
claims not being true. After, he heads to Clara’s&nbsp;
apartment to fix the sink clog he had orchestrated&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.360
and ruins her watch. Hiding once again under&nbsp;
Clara’s bed, he patiently waits for her to fall&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:08.640
asleep while she talks to her boyfriend on the&nbsp;
phone. Once done, he uses chloroform to maintain&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.440
her deep sleep as he continues to sabotage&nbsp;
more of her items in an attempt to upset her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:18.400
This time, he plants bug eggs in different&nbsp;
areas of her apartment. Days pass and Clara&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:23.280
develops a rash. This negatively affects her,&nbsp;
and her mood and demeanor noticeably change.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.960
For weeks, she has no idea that Cesar is behind&nbsp;
her suffering, and that he shares the same bed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.040
with him every night. The letters addressed&nbsp;
to her are written as if she has a stalker,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.640
but little does she know, it is from the&nbsp;
very man to who she entrusts her apartment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:37.680
to.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.880
The following week, Clara’s rashes have subsided,&nbsp;
putting her in a state of relief—but not for long.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:48.640
As she opens her medicine cabinet, she sees bugs&nbsp;
all over it. She rushes to the lobby to ask for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:53.040
help from none other than Cesar. Clearly, he&nbsp;
is highly entertained by the situation and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:57.280
gets satisfaction out of people’s struggles.&nbsp;
Because of the infestation in her apartment,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.120
Clara decides to stay at her mother’s&nbsp;
place until Cesar fumigates her apartment.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:06.480
Clara and Cesar enter the elevator together,&nbsp;
and Cesar asks about the guy harassing her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:10.640
Clara gets weirded out because she hasn’t&nbsp;
talked to anyone about it, but Cesar insists&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:15.200
that she might have shared it with Veronica, and&nbsp;
Veronica might have told him. She also adds that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:19.360
the police have tracked down the signal of her&nbsp;
harasser, and reveals that the culprit lives in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:23.840
the same building. Clara subtly says that the&nbsp;
police are getting closer to catching the guy.&nbsp;

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:27.440
&nbsp;
Deeply concerned about how far he has gone, Cesar&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.760
expresses his worries to his mother who has no&nbsp;
choice but to listen to how her son copes with his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:36.720
mental struggles. He also tells his mother that&nbsp;
he will do all it takes to make Clara miserable,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:41.440
so he starts to come up with ways to devastate&nbsp;
her as he cleans the apartment. The supervisor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:46.240
interrupts him and claims that Cesar is a waste of&nbsp;
space as he does not last long in his past jobs.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.880
He rudely tells Cesar to start looking for a&nbsp;
new source of income as he is on the brink of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:52.800
unemployment once more.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:57.440
That same day, three police officers enter the&nbsp;
building, asking Cesar if they could have a word&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:02.080
with him. The officers gather the staff around&nbsp;
a room to investigate Clara's complaints of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:07.280
being harassed. Despite this, Cesar remains&nbsp;
composed and unbothered by the situation,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:11.360
even when asked who has access to the&nbsp;
office. He leads the police officers to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.040
the cleaner’s son’s locker where they find&nbsp;
yellow envelopes similar to the harasser’s.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:19.360
Cesar has successfully framed the poor boy&nbsp;
and results in the boy getting arrested.&nbsp;

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:20.880
&nbsp;
From a payphone booth,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:25.440
Cesar calls Clara to inform her that the apartment&nbsp;
has been fumigated and is in its prime condition.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.440
Clara gladly tells him that she is excited to get&nbsp;
back home. To prepare for her arrival, Cesar heads&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:36.480
back to his quarters to prepare several tools&nbsp;
he needs to sabotage Clara’s place even more.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:41.440
He disturbingly holds a knife beside her empty&nbsp;
bed, as if practicing how to stab someone.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:46.960
He then crawls under the bed. Not long after, he&nbsp;
sees that Clara invited her boyfriend Marcos over&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:52.720
to spend the night together. All this time, Cesar&nbsp;
is under the bed while the couple gets intimate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:57.760
with each other, causing the bed to bounce. Cesar&nbsp;
accidentally drops some chloroform on his face.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:02.080
Desperately battling the effects of the&nbsp;
substance, Cesar makes his way out of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:05.920
bedroom while the two are making love.&nbsp;
As he attempts to leave the apartment,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:09.600
he realizes that he has the wrong set&nbsp;
of keys, leaving him locked inside.

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:14.640
The following day, he wakes up in Clara’s&nbsp;
bathroom, while Clara prepares her bath.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:20.480
Cesar tries to be as quiet as possible, but Marcos&nbsp;
finds Cesar’s sports bag with numerous suspicious&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:25.440
items. They unpack the bag full of tools and&nbsp;
find Cesar’s diary where he logs the tenants’&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:31.200
activities and routines. As they start to read&nbsp;
it, Clara becomes dizzy, so Marcos tends to her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:36.080
completely disregarding the suspicious bag.&nbsp;
This also gives Cesar the opportunity to exit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:40.720
the bathroom and hide in the kitchen, but Marcos&nbsp;
comes into the kitchen to find something to eat.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:44.960
While they make a grocery list, Cesar hides,&nbsp;
hoping that the couple wouldn’t come any closer.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:48.880
The couple playfully hangs out in the&nbsp;
living room on the way to the bathroom,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:53.280
so Cesar waits for the perfect time to pass&nbsp;
unnoticed and retrieve the keys to get out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:57.920
He successfully enters the bedroom and secures&nbsp;
the key and his diary, but on his way out,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:02.960
Marcos gets a glimpse of him and follows him to&nbsp;
the door. When Marcos catches him, Cesar asks who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:07.600
he is, causing a commotion in the apartment until&nbsp;
Clara enters the scene to calm the two men down.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:12.720
She explains that Marcos is her boyfriend and&nbsp;
that Cesar should not worry about anything.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:17.040
When asked why he is in the apartment, Cesar&nbsp;
informs them that he left his fumigation gear&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:22.800
in there, where Veronica’s keys are. He also adds&nbsp;
that Veronica needs her keys. Thinking nothing is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:27.280
out of the ordinary, the couple lets Cesar go,&nbsp;
and Cesar successfully deceives the couple.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:29.440
&nbsp;
After the eventful morning,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:34.480
he heads downstairs only to find that he is going&nbsp;
to be dismissed from the job. The two supervisors&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:38.400
inform him that he has two weeks to gather&nbsp;
his things before permanently being laid off.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:43.520
While doing so, Veronica consoles him and&nbsp;
offers some stew to cheer him up. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:47.920
the distressed Cesar insults the kind lady by&nbsp;
saying that she will forever be alone and that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:52.800
the tenants in the apartment only talk to her&nbsp;
out of pity. Veronica then walks away crying and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:57.920
bumps into Clara and Marcos who are on the way&nbsp;
to the lobby. When Clara greets the old lady,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:02.240
she just gives a faint smile as she goes up&nbsp;
to her apartment. Learning that the couple&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:06.320
is having a trip out of town, Cesar dwells&nbsp;
on it and gets in an extremely sad mood.&nbsp;

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:11.680
After weeks, he returns to the rooftop and&nbsp;
contemplates again on his inability to find&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:16.800
any happiness in the world. Feeling hopeless,&nbsp;
he gets on the edge to take his own life, but he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:22.080
spots Clara and Marcos back at the building. The&nbsp;
two have a big fight after finding out that Clara&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:27.360
is four weeks pregnant. Because they have not seen&nbsp;
each other for six weeks, Marcos finds it strange&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:32.320
for her to be pregnant as they also use protection&nbsp;
whenever they get intimate. Clara defends herself&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:37.040
by saying that according to the doctor, it&nbsp;
is possible, but Marcos remains unconvinced,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:41.600
causing a bump in the relationship. Far from&nbsp;
their knowledge, Cesar has caught up on all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:46.960
the information while he hides under the bed. When&nbsp;
the couple falls asleep, he uses chloroform to put&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:51.440
them out again and tells the unconscious Clara&nbsp;
that their affair is starting to bear fruit. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:55.760
then removes his shirt before climbing in bed and&nbsp;
in between the couple to get intimate with Clara.&nbsp;

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:59.200
&nbsp;
The following day, Marcos knocks at Cesar’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:03.200
quarters asking him to check Clara’s apartment&nbsp;
as he thinks that there is a bug problem again.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:09.520
Inside, Marcos finds out Cesar has been drugging&nbsp;
Clara with chloroform. Filled with rage,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:14.480
Marcos attacks Cesar, trying to extract more&nbsp;
information, but Cesar maintains a cool manner.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:20.080
After Cesar says that Clara does not mind it,&nbsp;
Marcos becomes more agitated and holds Cesar’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:25.440
head against a closet, but still, Cesar does not&nbsp;
fight back. When Marcos tackles him to the bed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:30.160
Cesar uses a piece of broken glass to stab Marcos&nbsp;
in the neck and drags the poor man around the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:34.960
apartment. He lets him bleed to death inside the&nbsp;
bathtub, and leaves a piece of glass in his hand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:40.160
to make it look like Marcos took his own life.&nbsp;
Afterward, he fixes the apartment while completely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:43.200
disregarding the overflowing tub and Marcos.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:48.160
Eventually, the authorities are contacted about&nbsp;
the situation, and all people inside the building&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:53.520
gather around. Cesar is summoned by the officers&nbsp;
and on the way, he sees Ursula give a smirk,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:58.320
indicating that she has knowledge of what&nbsp;
happened. In Clara’s apartment, a disastrous scene&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:03.440
welcomes him inside as she cries uncontrollably&nbsp;
while an officer consoles. One of them questions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:08.320
Cesar about Marcos but gets dismissed right&nbsp;
away. On his way back to his quarters, he sees&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:12.960
a note saying “I saw you.” Knowing that Ursula&nbsp;
is aware that he was involved in Marcos’ death,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:17.920
Cesar sneaks into Ursula’s mother’s apartment&nbsp;
and chases the poor girl around. She runs to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:22.720
her parents’ room only to find out that Cesar had&nbsp;
drugged them. He grabs Ursula and threatens her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:25.120
and her loved ones if she rats him out.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:30.080
Clara’s moving day finally comes; as she goes down&nbsp;
to the lobby, she could not even utter one word&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:35.600
as she remains in disbelief about Marcos’ death.&nbsp;
As she leaves, Cesar seems to indulge in the joy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:41.120
of seeing her sad, happily smiling at the sight of&nbsp;
her tearful face. Months have passed and Clara has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:46.480
delivered a healthy baby boy. Out of nowhere, she&nbsp;
sees a familiar envelope and finds out that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:51.280
letter is from Cesar who reveals that he is the&nbsp;
father of her child. He also writes he is hoping&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:55.600
that every time she looks at their baby, she will&nbsp;
think of him, and finally thanks her for helping&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:55.600 --> 00:12:00.640
him find happiness. Clara embraces her baby in&nbsp;
tears as Cesar takes pride in what he has done.
