00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.360
Welcome back to Movie Recapped.&nbsp;
Today I will show you a drama,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.720
thriller film from 2018, titled Hippopotamus.&nbsp;
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.&nbsp;

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.960
At the beginning of the movie, we see a wounded&nbsp;
young woman slowly gaining back her consciousness&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.200
in what appears to be a fully white room. The&nbsp;
moment she opens her eyes she panics and tries&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:26.320
to get up, but is unable to do so. It turns out&nbsp;
her legs are wounded, covered in bandages. As&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.360
the woman analyzes her surroundings, a sinister&nbsp;
male voice appears, telling her she overslept.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:36.240
The man introduces himself as Thomas Allcroft,&nbsp;
her kidnapper. He explains to the woman that he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.720
plans to keep her captive until she falls in love&nbsp;
with him, and proceeds to tell the woman her name,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:45.120
Ruby Watts, along with other personal details from&nbsp;
her life, like where she’s from and where she’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.600
gone to University. He even tells her about her&nbsp;
parent's professions and how he knows she’s afraid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.480
of the dark. Ruby clearly doesn't have any memory&nbsp;
of how she ended up in Thomas’s care nor does&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.120
she remember her life prior to her kidnapping.&nbsp;
Crying, she asks Thomas what has he done to her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.760
alluding to the wounds on her knees. Thomas tells&nbsp;
her he severed her ligaments, and instructs her to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.000
keep from moving if she ever wants to walk again.&nbsp;
He also informs her that he did not touch her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.880
private belongings, which are in a black handbag&nbsp;
sat on a chair, next to the door. On the floor,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:18.160
next to Ruby, we see what appears to be a meal and&nbsp;
a small cup containing two pills. Thomas explains&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.640
that he gave her two pills; one contraceptive&nbsp;
pill and one painkiller. He then proceeds to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.560
explain to Ruby how their life together will&nbsp;
look like; she will be offered daily food,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.440
he’ll help her wash and go to the bathroom. Her&nbsp;
days will start at seven AM and end at eleven PM,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.000
and escaping will be practically impossible since&nbsp;
they're miles away from the closest household.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.800
Once Thomas finishes, Ruby asks if he had&nbsp;
assaulted her, to which he replies he didn’t.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.200
Thomas then leaves, leaving Ruby alone in&nbsp;
the room. As the scene comes to an end,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.400
we see Ruby caught a glimpse of her bracelet,&nbsp;
which barres the engraving “Ruby X.” The next day,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.720
Ruby is still at the same spot as she was&nbsp;
yesterday. The empty plate next to her reveals&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.440
she ate the dish Thomas had prepared for her, but&nbsp;
didn’t touch the pills. Thomas enters the room to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.840
check up on her, and lets out a disappointed sigh&nbsp;
once he notices Ruby denied taking the pills.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.280
He pleads for her to take the medication as her&nbsp;
pain will only get worse, but Ruby ignores him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.600
As he turns to exit the room, Ruby asks&nbsp;
Thomas why he’s doing all of this, to which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.720
he doesn’t reply. Thomas exits the room and as&nbsp;
the door slams shut, cutting the scene to black,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.000
we hear Ruby’s desperate cry from the other side.&nbsp;
Later the same day, Thomas visits Ruby again.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.040
This time the room is shaded with a dark red&nbsp;
light, signaling that it’s nighttime. Thomas&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.680
carefully adjusts Ruby’s sleeping body so she lays&nbsp;
in a fetal position on the floor, and exits the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:39.360
room. The next morning, Thomas brings Ruby her&nbsp;
breakfast. Ruby is still sound asleep, but is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.240
awakened when Thomas knocks on the wall. Once he&nbsp;
leaves, Ruby’s sleepy and dazed look morphs into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:49.280
a serious one, revealing that her groggy state was&nbsp;
a facade. She then scoots her way to her handbag,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.840
which is on the other side of the room. She opens&nbsp;
and scavenges through it, and pulls out her mirror&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.520
which holds her ID. Ruby stares at it, puzzled.&nbsp;
After she noticed a shadow from a tiny window,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.840
she hurriedly puts her belongings back in her bag,&nbsp;
but a small plastic bag escapes and rolls away.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.680
Ruby scoots back to her usual spot and notices the&nbsp;
ball. She reaches to get it and manages to hide it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.160
in her pocket before Thomas enters the room.&nbsp;
Thomas brings her a tray of food and inspects&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:19.120
her face. He notices she is in pain and says she&nbsp;
should have told him. He reaches for his pocket&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.320
and pulls out a pill bottle. He urges Ruby to take&nbsp;
a higher dose, and she complies. He hand feeds her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:29.120
the pills and leaves. Later, we see what seems&nbsp;
to be a woman floating in dark water. It turns&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.120
out that it was a fragment of Ruby’s dream.&nbsp;
She wakes up distressed and tries to get up,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:38.320
but stops as a sharp pain runs through her legs.&nbsp;
Thomas is already in the room, sitting in a chair&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:43.280
close to Ruby. Ruby asks him who he is and what&nbsp;
has he done to her. Thomas calmly says the same&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.600
thing he said to her the first time she saw him&nbsp;
in the room; that his name is Thomas Alcroft, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:52.080
that he plans to keep her captive until she falls&nbsp;
in love with him. He repeats the same information&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:57.040
he knows about her. Ruby asks what has he done&nbsp;
to her legs. Thomas explains it was a necessary&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.600
procedure to limit her chances of running away,&nbsp;
and that her legs will get better as time passes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:06.080
He informs her that all she needs to do is stay&nbsp;
compliant and take her medication. He assures&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.920
her that he doesn't have any hidden malicious&nbsp;
intentions by giving her contraceptive pills.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.560
Ruby’s reminded of her everyday schedule&nbsp;
and how slim her chances are of escaping.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.760
She stays silent until Thomas turns to leave the&nbsp;
room. She once again asks him if he assaulted her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:25.280
This angers Thomas and he throws her bag as he&nbsp;
exits the room. Once alone, Ruby inspects the ball&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:30.320
she hid in her pocket. She takes a closer look at&nbsp;
her bracelet as well. Later, we see the rest of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:35.840
Ruby’s day; Thomas performing psychical therapy on&nbsp;
Ruby, him bathing her using washcloths, and Ruby&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.960
repeatedly slamming the ball on the room’s door&nbsp;
once it’s nighttime. The next day, Ruby notices&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.520
the wound in the back of her head. She goes to her&nbsp;
bag and pulls out a mirror, but doesn’t manage to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:50.080
see much of her injury. She ends up slamming the&nbsp;
mirror into smaller pieces and takes a closer to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.480
her wound. Before she could see anything,&nbsp;
she notices Thomas spying on her from the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:58.880
other side of the door. She hides the glass shard&nbsp;
underneath the bandage of her left knee and tries&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:04.400
to go back to her usual sitting place. Before&nbsp;
she does, Thomas enters the room and drugs her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:09.600
Once it’s nighttime, Thomas plays an audio that is&nbsp;
aimed to discourage Ruby from moving and escaping.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:13.280
He proceeds to clean and rearrange the room&nbsp;
and ends up falling asleep on the chair.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:18.400
His phone alarm wakes him up. He turns the&nbsp;
discouraging audio off and sits Ruby in an upward&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:23.600
position, and leaves. We then see a series of days&nbsp;
Thomas and Ruby spend together, which consisted&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:28.080
of Thomas bringing Ruby food and helping her with&nbsp;
her hygiene, and Ruby spending most of her nights&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:33.040
playing catch with her ball. One morning,&nbsp;
Ruby is seen fondling with the sink’s pipes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:36.880
The mess she made doesn't appear to bother&nbsp;
Thomas when he enters to bring her breakfast.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:41.840
While he investigates what she did, Ruby asks if&nbsp;
she could ask him a question. She asks him what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:45.760
would happen if she doesn't fall in love with him,&nbsp;
and will she stay captive forever if she doesn't.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:50.720
She goes on to joke about what Thomas did to her&nbsp;
legs. Thomas asks her what can he give to her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:55.840
which confuses Ruby. Thomas says she’s obviously&nbsp;
feeling better, due to the fact she’s even joking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.840
about her situation. Thomas states that she&nbsp;
must be getting bored, and offers to bring&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.920
her something in order to make her stay more&nbsp;
tolerable. Ruby thinks for a second and asks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:09.120
Thomas to bring her a pillow and a blanket, and a&nbsp;
book to pass the time. Thomas complies, then asks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:14.160
her about the two drawings on the wall; one of a&nbsp;
chair and one of a brain, done in pencil. She says&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:18.720
they’re pretty. Thomas compliments her by saying&nbsp;
she looks better and asks her to repeat what she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:23.600
wanted to be brought to her, and she does. The&nbsp;
next day Ruby is seen on a mattress, with a pillow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:28.800
beside her. Thomas enters and gives her a book.&nbsp;
After she flips through it, she states she read&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:33.760
it before. Ruby gets overwhelmed since that book&nbsp;
is the only thing she remembers before her life in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:38.240
captivity. Thomas explains to Ruby that she could&nbsp;
get back some of her memories if they’re triggered&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:43.200
by certain triggers, which gives her a glimmer of&nbsp;
hope. Thomas offers to help her regain her memory,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:48.640
and she thanks him. Later, when Thomas brings her&nbsp;
food, he asks Ruby if there is anything she wants.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:53.840
She says she wants a red bush tee, and he&nbsp;
instantly brings it to her. After smelling it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:58.640
Ruby awakens a memory. She smiles and questions&nbsp;
Thomas whether he knew she was going to pick this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:03.520
specific tea. He smiles and tells her that&nbsp;
it’s the only thing she drinks. Ruby asks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:07.280
him how does he know all the information about&nbsp;
her, to which he replies he did his research.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:12.640
Later in the day, Ruby is seen examining&nbsp;
her book. She stumbles to a page filled with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:16.720
apparently meaningless letters, but as she puts&nbsp;
the mirror piece she hid earlier on the letters,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:20.240
she ends up seeing some of the letters&nbsp;
spell out ‘don’t trust him’ in the mirror.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:24.720
Thomas carefully enters the room seconds later&nbsp;
with a table. It turns out Thomas wanted them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:29.760
to have dinner together, which they do. Thomas&nbsp;
asks Ruby about the book, and Ruby praises it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:34.880
especially it's ending. Thomas smiles and attempts&nbsp;
to take Ruby’s hand in his, but Ruby pulls away.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:40.560
Thomas asks Ruby what is wrong. Although hesitant&nbsp;
at first, Ruby asks Thomas how many others were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:45.280
held captive before her. Thomas denies her&nbsp;
allegations but Ruby is set on uncovering the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:50.960
truth. She proceeds to accuse Thomas of stalking,&nbsp;
enslaving, assaulting, and murdering young women&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:56.000
like her. Before she can go on, Thomas bangs&nbsp;
his fist on the table, which startles her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.880
He wipes clean the blood on his arm and once again&nbsp;
denies her allegations. Ruby claims she doesn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:05.360
want Thomas having done this before to someone&nbsp;
else, as she believes what they have is special.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:09.600
Thomas swears there is no one else and&nbsp;
leaves the room. The second Thomas leaves,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:14.480
Ruby’s scared expressions disappears, revealing&nbsp;
to the audience that she was just pretending.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:18.720
The next day, we see Thomas informing Ruby&nbsp;
her legs are healing but they need more time.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:23.680
When he leaves, Ruby unwraps the bandages&nbsp;
from her legs and inspects her injury.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:28.160
It seems as if no cuts were made on her legs.&nbsp;
She manages to get up and goes to the door.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:33.040
When she touches the doorknob she unlocks another&nbsp;
memory, which is of a man and Ruby in front of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:37.840
her front door. Ruby gives up on attempting&nbsp;
to open the door and goes back to her bed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:42.320
As she is reading the obscure message in her book,&nbsp;
she accidentally smears the ink the message was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:46.720
writing with. After she smells the ink that&nbsp;
stained her hand a new memory is unlocked,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:51.040
this time of herself hiding something behind&nbsp;
a brick in the room. Ruby removes the brick&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:55.360
and a dozen matches fall out, revealing that the&nbsp;
obscure messages were written using the matches.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.960
Later, Thomas and Ruby are having dinner. Ruby&nbsp;
asks for a candle to set up a romantic mood.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:05.040
Once Thomas brings it to her and lights it up&nbsp;
using a match. He proceeds to tell her that they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:09.600
should start over, and Ruby agrees. Ruby then&nbsp;
tells Thomas about the recurring dream she’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:14.320
been having, of her sinking deep underwater.&nbsp;
As she tells the details of her dream, her hand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:19.200
inches closer to the match. She tells Thomas her&nbsp;
dreams end when a hand reaches out to save her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:23.280
By the end of her story, her hand is on the&nbsp;
match, but Thomas has his hand holding hers.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:28.000
Ruby fakes a cough and brings her hand to her&nbsp;
chest, successfully taking the match without&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.960
Thomas noticing. In the next scene, we see&nbsp;
how Ruby’s days are going. She’s scribbling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:38.080
in her book, exercising her legs, and practicing&nbsp;
how to use her broken mirror part as a weapon.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:42.240
While Thomas is helping her to walk again, she’s&nbsp;
pretending her legs aren’t in great condition.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:47.200
At the end of the scene, we notice Ruby wrote&nbsp;
‘play along’ in her book. The next morning,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:52.640
Ruby is seen during push ups. She rushes to her&nbsp;
bed once she hears Thomas approaching her room.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:57.600
To avoid suspicion she pretends to read her book.&nbsp;
Thomas suggests he should help her to exercise her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:02.960
legs before dinner, to which she agrees. As Thomas&nbsp;
helps Ruby to walk, she once again acts as if her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:07.680
legs are wounded. After they manage to get to&nbsp;
the other side of the room, Thomas congratulates&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:11.600
her on her progress and states that if they&nbsp;
continue this way they may have dinner upstairs.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:16.960
In the evening, Thomas and Ruby are having dinner&nbsp;
again. Thomas proclaims that this is a very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:22.160
special meal and urges Ruby to taste it. After&nbsp;
she takes a bite, Ruby unlocks another memory,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:26.560
this one being of her and Thomas having dinner&nbsp;
at a restaurant. They seem to be on a date and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:30.880
are comfortable with each other. Thomas then&nbsp;
asks Ruby to close her eyes, and proceeds to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:35.760
put on a necklace he bought for her. He kisses&nbsp;
her on her forehead. We then cut back to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:41.120
present. Ruby is in shock and asks Thomas whether&nbsp;
they were together before. Thomas nodes his head&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:46.240
and tells Ruby that the meal she vividly remembers&nbsp;
was their anniversary meal. Ruby tearfully smiles&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:51.040
at him. At night, Ruby is seen brushing&nbsp;
her teeth. As she admired the two drawings&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:55.200
Thomas put on the walls, she notices “R.A.W”&nbsp;
written on one of the corners of the drawing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:59.840
In the morning, Ruby sees someone in a boat whilst&nbsp;
looking through a small window from her room.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:05.120
Later, she and Thomas are discussing her book.&nbsp;
Thomas mentioned how inseparable Ruby was from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:10.000
her book. He starts reminiscing of their memories&nbsp;
together. As he tells his story, the scene cuts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.520
to Ruby drawing, surrounded by numerous crayon&nbsp;
drawings. Thomas is sound asleep on her bed. When&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:20.640
she made sure he was out cold, Ruby quietly makes&nbsp;
her way to the door. Before she opens it, Thomas&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:25.600
says it’s cold outside, thus she needs a coat.&nbsp;
Instead of opening the door, she reaches down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:30.880
to pick up her ball, as Thomas slowly awakens.&nbsp;
The scene ends with Ruby saying she can’t sleep.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:35.280
The next scene opens with Ruby sleeping in bed and&nbsp;
Thomas covering her with a blanket, which triggers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:40.240
another memory of what seems to be her and Thomas&nbsp;
being intimate. The next day, Thomas dances with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:45.120
Ruby, which triggers another memory. The memory&nbsp;
is of Ruby and Thomas dancing at a party while&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:49.440
Thomas is proclaiming his love for her. Ruby&nbsp;
tells him she feels the same way and the two&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:54.480
kiss. After experiencing the memory, Ruby tells&nbsp;
Thomas she now fully believes they were together.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:55.040 --> 00:12:00.080
Later, Thomas explains how the remote control&nbsp;
which controls the whole room’s electronics works.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:05.600
He puts up some music, and Ruby starts dancing for&nbsp;
him. The two laugh and kiss, but before they start&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:10.560
to get intimate Ruby starts crying. Ruby asks&nbsp;
him how did they get to this, and Thomas agrees&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:16.000
to explain it to her. As Thomas is explaining&nbsp;
the story, the scene cuts to the past. We see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.960
Ruby waiting for Thomas at a bar. She’s with her&nbsp;
roommate Nick, who’s openly flirting with her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:25.120
Thomas doesn't make it to meet her since he missed&nbsp;
the train, thus Ruby and Nick leave to go home.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:29.440
Thomas leaves Ruby a message that he’s being&nbsp;
picked up by his friend Rob and how he’ll&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:35.040
hopefully see her soon. Meanwhile, Nick tries&nbsp;
to kiss Ruby and she refuses, but he persists.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:39.600
He knocks her unconscious and brutally assaults&nbsp;
her. Upon seeing the aftermath of what happened&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:43.920
when he came to Ruby’s house, Thomas killed the&nbsp;
still drunk Nick and carried Ruby to Rob’s car.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:48.960
Rob reluctantly drove them both to Thomas'&nbsp;
home, where Ruby regained her consciousness.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:52.320
It is revealed Ruby lost her memory&nbsp;
due to the incident with Nick.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:57.680
Before Rob can call an ambulance, Thomas stops&nbsp;
him. They argue for a bit, but Rob agrees to help&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:02.480
Thomas out in his plan to regain Ruby’s memory.&nbsp;
They travel far north where Thomas breaks ties&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:07.040
with Rob and thanks to him for his help. Thomas&nbsp;
proceeds to take Ruby to an abandoned island&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:12.320
farm where he keeps Ruby prisoner. As time passes&nbsp;
Thomas starts learning about retrograde amnesia,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:16.480
a form of amnesia in which the sufferer&nbsp;
forgets everything prior to an attack.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:20.880
He also learned that Ruby’s memory seemed to reset&nbsp;
to just as it was right after the attack whenever&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:25.840
she would sleep a lot. Thomas proceeds to show&nbsp;
Ruby pictures to trigger her memory recovery,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:31.040
but she is unresponsive at first. In an attempt to&nbsp;
speed up her memory recovery, Thomas learned how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:35.040
to trigger certain memories and control her sleep&nbsp;
patterns so she could learn for more than a day.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:39.120
When he gives her her favorite book,&nbsp;
Ruby is responsive and shows progress.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:44.000
Thomas continues his efforts, but decides he&nbsp;
needs a blank slate in order to truly regain&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.320
Ruby’s trust and memory, so he constructed the&nbsp;
white room and made up the whole scenario about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:53.040
cutting the ligaments of Ruby’s legs and being&nbsp;
her kidnapper. When Thomas finishes his story,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:58.080
Ruby is left in tears and seems to get her memory&nbsp;
back. The two become intimate and fall asleep on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:02.640
one another. Ruby awakens first and turns off&nbsp;
Thomas' watch before it can ring his alarm.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:08.400
She takes the broken mirror piece and stabs him.&nbsp;
She starts crawling to escape, but Thomas tries to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:13.840
stop her. She kicks him with her feet and manages&nbsp;
to escape to the outside. She gazes tearfully at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:18.880
the sky above, then runs to the boat, but passes&nbsp;
out before she can make her escape. She awakens&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:23.120
in a hospital room, with a doctor assuring her&nbsp;
she’ll be fine and that she may experience some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:28.000
short-term memory loss due to her injury. The&nbsp;
doctor is revealed to be Thomas, who yet again&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.000
orchestrated a different scenario in hopes of&nbsp;
gaining Ruby’s trust and regaining her memory.
