00:00:06.307 --> 00:00:07.795
hey what's up guys

00:00:07.843 --> 00:00:12.403
today I'll show you a supernatural horror film: "The Autopsy of Jane Doe" 

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:15.859
spoiler ahead, watch out and take care

00:00:16.003 --> 00:00:20.467
multiple homicides occur in Grantham, leaving behind a bloody crime scene 

00:00:20.563 --> 00:00:25.219
no stranger's fingerprints or signs of force entry are found on the premises 

00:00:25.315 --> 00:00:29.731
the condition of corpses suggests that they were trying to escape the house but failed 

00:00:29.827 --> 00:00:33.379
but the weirdest thing found is the pristine body of a woman 

00:00:33.427 --> 00:00:35.203
partially buried in the basement

00:00:35.251 --> 00:00:40.525
in fact, the identity and cause of death are clear for all the victims, except for the woman

00:00:40.525 --> 00:00:43.800
what is more troubling is that there is no apparent reason for her 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.475
to have been at the crime scene

00:00:45.475 --> 00:00:48.691
the sheriff decides to name her Jane Doe for the time being   

00:00:49.076 --> 00:00:52.724
on the other hand, Tommy Tilden and his son Austin Tilden run a morgue

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.412
which has been a staple in Grantham for years  

00:00:55.556 --> 00:00:59.108
there are two lifts in their basement, one is of a step ladder style 

00:00:59.156 --> 00:01:01.220
with the door only opening outwards 

00:01:01.268 --> 00:01:05.396
Tildens are so professional that they can find out the cause of death for anybody

00:01:05.444 --> 00:01:10.052
however, Austin knows how hard it is to find a girlfriend while working as a coroner

00:01:10.196 --> 00:01:11.732
so he does not want to continue

00:01:11.828 --> 00:01:14.852
luckily, his girlfriend is not afraid of the morgue at all 

00:01:14.948 --> 00:01:17.348
and offers to see the dissected corpses

00:01:17.684 --> 00:01:21.188
meanwhile, Girlfriend wonders why a bell is tied to each corpse 

00:01:21.476 --> 00:01:25.412
Tommy explains that it is a coroner's professional habit to ensure they were dead

00:01:25.556 --> 00:01:28.628
Austin is ready to go on a date with Girlfriend after work 

00:01:28.772 --> 00:01:33.044
right at the moment, the sheriff drops the dead woman's body at Tilden morgue 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:34.916
noting the urgency of this task

00:01:35.012 --> 00:01:38.276
Austin does not want to have his father working overtime alone 

00:01:38.372 --> 00:01:42.068
so he blows off the date and asks her to come back a few hours later 

00:01:42.212 --> 00:01:46.916
sheriff wants them to find out who she is and how she died before the night is out  

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.708
after sending the sheriff off, Austin turns on the video recorder 

00:01:50.756 --> 00:01:52.868
and starts autopsy with Tommy 

00:01:53.012 --> 00:01:56.948
at this time, the radio forecasts that the next few days will be sunny

00:01:56.996 --> 00:01:58.772
but no one pays attention to it 

00:01:58.868 --> 00:02:01.844
the first step in an autopsy is a visual assessment

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.956
Jane was about twenty to thirty years old

00:02:04.052 --> 00:02:07.508
with a thin waist, fair skin, and no obvious trauma

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.820
but what happens next is incomprehensible to the Tildens 

00:02:10.916 --> 00:02:13.988
her eyes have clouded, which indicates she had died for days 

00:02:14.084 --> 00:02:18.308
but the corpse has not been fossilized, meaning her death is quite recent

00:02:18.404 --> 00:02:20.276
as the Tildens examine the body

00:02:20.324 --> 00:02:23.300
they quickly notice both her wrists and ankles have been broken

00:02:23.396 --> 00:02:27.572
but no bruising or any visible sign of injury appear on her skin 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.875
in her fingernail is detected some Northern soil, but they are in the South

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.750
Austin takes photos of those characteristics 

00:02:34.916 --> 00:02:38.180
while Tommy sketches out the position of her injuries on the blackboard 

00:02:38.276 --> 00:02:42.740
at the same time, a fly crawls out of her nose, and her nose sheds some blood

00:02:42.884 --> 00:02:47.204
later, they discover that her tongue has been cut out and one of her teeth missing

00:02:47.492 --> 00:02:51.956
a thin thread is hidden in her mouth and there has been obvious damage to the genitals

00:02:52.196 --> 00:02:55.172
all the anomalies point to a complex cause of death 

00:02:55.508 --> 00:03:00.980
the time now is already nine forty-five in the evening, Austin knows his date is ruined 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.444
the Tildens move on to the second part of the autopsy -- internal testing

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.524
annoyed by the radio noises, Austin switches it to a music channel

00:03:09.695 --> 00:03:11.759
so the dissection begins in light music 

00:03:11.903 --> 00:03:14.879
however, rare phenomena continue to occur

00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:18.767
first of all, the blood of the corpse flows freely like that of a living man 

00:03:18.863 --> 00:03:21.935
and then all the specimens in the refrigerator have gone bad

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:24.767
as they cut into her, things get stranger

00:03:24.911 --> 00:03:28.943
the lungs have been severely burned as if the body was set on fire

00:03:29.135 --> 00:03:33.023
other internal organs have stab wounds from various sharp objects

00:03:33.071 --> 00:03:38.015
it is medically irrational to have her internal organs harmed while her skin remains intact

00:03:38.303 --> 00:03:39.167
if she is murdered

00:03:39.263 --> 00:03:43.103
they don't know how or why the murderer killed her in such a complicated way

00:03:43.295 --> 00:03:47.615
when they are deep in doubt, they are awakened by some noises from the hallway

00:03:47.807 --> 00:03:50.735
Austin goes out and spots a man in the retroreflector

00:03:50.927 --> 00:03:53.711
but when he walks to it, he finds no one  

00:03:53.903 --> 00:03:57.215
in the lab, Tommy accidentally cuts his wrist on a bone

00:03:57.407 --> 00:04:01.535
following the weird sound, Austin locates his cat in the ventilation duct

00:04:01.775 --> 00:04:06.431
the cat, Tommy's pet, is covered in bruises and appears to be dying soon

00:04:06.575 --> 00:04:08.447
in order to relieve the cat's pain

00:04:08.495 --> 00:04:12.575
Tommy has to snap its neck before reluctantly putting cremating it

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:16.511
back to the morgue, more unexplainable ghostly things await them

00:04:16.607 --> 00:04:19.967
the freezers in which the bodies are kept automatically open 

00:04:20.111 --> 00:04:23.999
then a northern flower, the Jimsonweed, is found in her intestines

00:04:24.191 --> 00:04:28.751
the flower and the soil in her fingernail imply that the corpse comes from the north

00:04:28.943 --> 00:04:32.687
right at this moment, the radio announces a storm is building up 

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:36.767
Austin feels insecure and suggests they pause it and resume tomorrow

00:04:36.911 --> 00:04:38.639
but Tommy thinks otherwise 

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:43.487
after that, a piece of cloth with an odd diagram is found in her stomach 

00:04:43.583 --> 00:04:46.271
unwrapping the cloth, they see her missing tooth 

00:04:46.415 --> 00:04:50.399
this shows that her missing tooth is knocked out by force and swallowed 

00:04:50.591 --> 00:04:52.751
putting all the astonishing events together

00:04:52.847 --> 00:04:57.167
Austin supposes the corpse to be a sacrificial offering of a certain cult 

00:04:57.503 --> 00:05:00.047
now the radio says the storm has caused flooding 

00:05:00.191 --> 00:05:03.407
Austin again requests to leave, but Tommy disagrees 

00:05:03.551 --> 00:05:07.967
continuing the autopsy, they find some odd diagrams underneath her skin 

00:05:08.255 --> 00:05:10.799
the closed door of the morgue suddenly swings open 

00:05:10.895 --> 00:05:14.111
all the light bulbs on the premises burst like lightning 

00:05:14.207 --> 00:05:17.951
Tommy finally decides to go, so the Tildens get up to run away 

00:05:18.191 --> 00:05:22.415
fortunately, the generator is still working, and power is soon restored

00:05:22.703 --> 00:05:26.495
but the basement exit is blocked by some branches and they cannot open it 

00:05:26.735 --> 00:05:29.567
worse still, their phone reception is cut off 

00:05:29.855 --> 00:05:33.455
during this time, footsteps and roars echo in the hallway 

00:05:33.551 --> 00:05:37.247
in panic, the Tildens return to the office and call the sheriff 

00:05:37.487 --> 00:05:40.655
but to their surprise, the telephone also fails

00:05:40.943 --> 00:05:44.015
shortly after that, they hear someone walking outside

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:47.999
through the crack in the door, Austin sees a pair of feet with bells on them

00:05:48.095 --> 00:05:50.447
the bells which belong only to the dead bodies 

00:05:50.543 --> 00:05:53.759
obviously, Jane is the root of all problems  

00:05:53.855 --> 00:05:57.743
the hopeless Tildens shut the doors tight and think hard of how to escape  

00:05:58.031 --> 00:06:00.719
however, there are no other alternatives for them   

00:06:01.151 --> 00:06:05.711
soon Tommy is attacked by an unseen figure with clouded eyes in the bathroom 

00:06:05.999 --> 00:06:08.159
recognizing this is a fight against death

00:06:08.255 --> 00:06:11.519
Tommy decides to destroy Jane before they get cleared

00:06:11.663 --> 00:06:15.071
the Tildens return to the morgue after the footsteps are cleared

00:06:15.263 --> 00:06:18.719
as soon as they step in, the door is shut automatically 

00:06:18.815 --> 00:06:22.127
Austin takes an ax and cuts a crack through the door 

00:06:22.271 --> 00:06:26.351
from the crack, they see corpses stored in the fridges rise from death

00:06:26.447 --> 00:06:30.095
without further ado, they set a fire on the dissecting table

00:06:30.287 --> 00:06:32.831
but the fire spreads everywhere out of control 

00:06:33.023 --> 00:06:35.759
the video camera and photos are burnt right away 

00:06:35.999 --> 00:06:39.695
the Tildens immediately apply the fire extinguisher to put off the fire

00:06:39.839 --> 00:06:41.903
but Jane is not burnt at all 

00:06:42.047 --> 00:06:46.751
the Tildens quickly flee to the lift, with the hordes of dead bodies chasing behind them

00:06:46.847 --> 00:06:49.823
however, the lift door is stuck after they get in 

00:06:49.919 --> 00:06:53.039
in despair, Tommy swings his ax at the lift 

00:06:53.135 --> 00:06:55.679
but he accidentally kills Austin's girlfriend 

00:06:55.871 --> 00:07:00.863
though Austin's grief is beyond words, he literally has no time to mourn for her death

00:07:00.911 --> 00:07:04.655
he returns to the lift with Tommy, and the lift works perfectly 

00:07:04.751 --> 00:07:07.823
but after a short while, the lift is stuck again 

00:07:07.967 --> 00:07:10.607
it looks impossible for them to survive tonight 

00:07:10.943 --> 00:07:16.367
Tommy apologizes, for it is his insistence on working overtime that leads to the disaster

00:07:16.463 --> 00:07:19.487
but Austin is pondering why the corpse does not kill them 

00:07:19.631 --> 00:07:24.623
since the autopsy begins, mysteries accumulate to prevent them from further dissection 

00:07:24.767 --> 00:07:29.471
he wonders if Jane has some secrets that could only be unraveled by autopsy 

00:07:29.567 --> 00:07:34.511
perhaps if they can find out how she died, they may be able to prevent this disaster

00:07:34.751 --> 00:07:37.151
so the Tildens return to the dissecting table 

00:07:37.439 --> 00:07:40.943
all of a sudden, a mass of smoke rises from the cremator

00:07:41.039 --> 00:07:45.071
while passing through the thick smoke, Tommy falls down to the floor 

00:07:45.311 --> 00:07:49.343
Austin saves him in time and the two of them finally land on their feet 

00:07:49.487 --> 00:07:52.127
to their shock, her brain tissue is alive 

00:07:52.367 --> 00:07:58.175
Austin realizes folding the cloth in half will lead him to a bible verse--Leviticus 20:27

00:07:58.271 --> 00:08:02.303
based on the verse and the Arabic numerals of 1693 on the cloth

00:08:02.399 --> 00:08:04.943
they speculate that the woman was probably a witch 

00:08:04.991 --> 00:08:07.583
sacrificed in northern Europe in the Middle Ages

00:08:07.727 --> 00:08:10.607
this is consistent with the slender waist of the female corpse

00:08:10.703 --> 00:08:13.007
for waist girdle was popular at that time

00:08:13.151 --> 00:08:17.135
back then, the witches of medieval Europe were mostly well-married women 

00:08:17.231 --> 00:08:19.199
who had been falsely accused

00:08:19.535 --> 00:08:22.175
Tommy is sure that since Jane merely tortures them 

00:08:22.271 --> 00:08:27.071
because she wants them to experience the same pain she had suffered over 300 years ago

00:08:27.311 --> 00:08:30.959
while saying so, Tommy discovers symbols beneath his own skin 

00:08:31.055 --> 00:08:34.271
he goes on to guess that Jane's body was discovered before

00:08:34.319 --> 00:08:37.967
but since the survivors could not destroy it, they had to bury her

00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:41.759
meanwhile, the resurrected bodies begin to bang against the door 

00:08:41.951 --> 00:08:43.871
Austin runs to stop them

00:08:43.967 --> 00:08:49.199
but Tommy begs Jane to let him bear the pain for her in exchange for his son's safety

00:08:49.343 --> 00:08:53.999
soon after that, Jane's joints are healed surprisingly, but Tommy's joints are broken

00:08:54.095 --> 00:08:57.935
her eyes return to normal while Tommy's eyes have turned grey

00:08:58.031 --> 00:09:02.687
looking at Tommy in severe pain, Austin decides to give his father a quick death

00:09:02.783 --> 00:09:04.895
Tommy's sacrifice seems to work 

00:09:05.039 --> 00:09:07.295
Austin then hears someone calling their names

00:09:07.391 --> 00:09:10.367
he runs to the exit, but the exit cannot be opened 

00:09:10.463 --> 00:09:15.119
out of nowhere, Austin sees Tommy's figure behind him and drops dead in terror

00:09:15.455 --> 00:09:19.583
when the police arrive, they find both Tommy and Austin dead

00:09:19.679 --> 00:09:22.847
however, his dead Girlfriend is nowhere to be found 

00:09:22.943 --> 00:09:27.695
at this time, the radio broadcasts that today is the fourth sunny day in the week

00:09:27.791 --> 00:09:32.063
in the morgue, nothing changes except the camera and photos are burnt 

00:09:32.207 --> 00:09:35.327
Jane lies as it is, without traces of dissection 

00:09:35.567 --> 00:09:40.223
Tommy and Austin die exactly the same way as that of the homicide victims

00:09:40.367 --> 00:09:44.255
sheriff orders to send Jane to a local University for further studies 

00:09:44.351 --> 00:09:47.183
but in the van, the car radio suddenly blares 

00:09:47.279 --> 00:09:50.207
and it plays the same song that has been played last night 

00:09:50.351 --> 00:09:53.231
the film ends with Jane wriggling her big toe 

00:09:53.663 --> 00:09:57.791
so it is clear that Jane was sacrificed as a witch three hundred years ago 

00:09:57.935 --> 00:10:01.295
she possessed the power for unknown reasons and began her revenge 

00:10:01.391 --> 00:10:03.647
by killing people through hallucination 

00:10:03.743 --> 00:10:06.911
homicide victims and the Tildens all die of hallucination

00:10:06.959 --> 00:10:09.023
many clues are hidden in the film

00:10:09.119 --> 00:10:13.007
for example, the weather forecast says today is the fourth sunny day of the week

00:10:13.103 --> 00:10:17.087
but on the night of the autopsy, it mentions a storm is building up  

00:10:17.423 --> 00:10:20.111
moreover, besides the body of Jane Doe

00:10:20.207 --> 00:10:23.711
the police only carry out two dead bodies from the crime scene 

00:10:23.807 --> 00:10:28.223
Austin's Girlfriend is not found, proving that Girlfriend doesn't visit there 

00:10:28.511 --> 00:10:32.159
another clue is Tommy and Austin's bodies are free from bloodstains 

00:10:32.399 --> 00:10:35.903
but last night, Austin has Girlfriend's blood on his hands and face

00:10:36.047 --> 00:10:39.551
in addition, Tommy's joints are broken, and his eyes turn grey 

00:10:39.647 --> 00:10:41.711
after he offers to be a sacrifice 

00:10:41.855 --> 00:10:46.175
but in reality, all Tommy has is the dagger Austin stabs him with

00:10:46.367 --> 00:10:49.775
the clock in the morgue also plays a part in the mystery 

00:10:50.015 --> 00:10:52.175
at nine, the corpses reach the morgue

00:10:52.223 --> 00:10:55.007
at nine forty-five, they begin the autopsy

00:10:55.103 --> 00:10:58.463
at four past ten, they are halfway through the autopsy 

00:10:58.655 --> 00:11:02.927
but after the cat dies, the time on the clock travels back to nine forty-five

00:11:03.119 --> 00:11:08.303
before the autopsy, the radio already says a storm is coming, but the storm is fake 

00:11:08.399 --> 00:11:11.615
so their hallucinations begin right before the autopsy 

00:11:11.711 --> 00:11:16.751
the cat's death serves as the twist, for the cat is often regarded as the witch's assistant 

00:11:16.847 --> 00:11:21.743
probably the cat wants to sacrifice itself for the witch to resurrect its witch master

00:11:21.983 --> 00:11:26.111
but Tommy breaks its neck and as such, discontinues its sacrifice

00:11:26.543 --> 00:11:30.479
so misfortune befalls on them and they are brought back to nine forty-five

00:11:30.575 --> 00:11:34.463
when they begin the autopsy and the new round of sacrifice as well

00:11:34.751 --> 00:11:39.167
Tommy suffers the pains of the sacrifice after begging her to spare his son 

00:11:39.359 --> 00:11:42.671
but in the end, his son just gives him a quick death by mistake 

00:11:42.719 --> 00:11:47.087
before he could complete the painful sacrifice ritual so as to resurrect the witch

00:11:47.231 --> 00:11:50.735
causing the father to fail in sacrificing himself in the end

00:11:50.831 --> 00:11:53.279
as a result, his son cannot escape death 

00:11:53.375 --> 00:11:56.495
and he's forced to death under the influence of hallucination

00:11:56.783 --> 00:12:01.247
as long as Jane does not resurrect, she will continue to murder lives in the same manner

00:12:01.343 --> 00:12:05.327
which is indicated by the final scene where Jane wriggling her big toe 

00:12:06.287 --> 00:12:09.263
this's Daniel CC movie channel, peace out
