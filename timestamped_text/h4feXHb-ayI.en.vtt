00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:03.823
Hi guys, K-Movie Recapped here. 

00:00:03.823 --> 00:00:07.042
Before&nbsp;we start, WARNING! Spoilers Ahead!&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:07.158 --> 00:00:12.640
Today, I’m going to explain a 2015 Japanese&nbsp;
Horror movie called Corpse Party.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.709
The story starts in a classroom&nbsp;

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:20.052
where Naomi and&nbsp;Satoshi are clearing up after 
their last ever&nbsp;cultural festival with the other five students.&nbsp;

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:23.136
Suddenly, a thunder causes a power cut.

00:00:23.456 --> 00:00:26.057
Ayumi,&nbsp;the class representative lights up a candle

00:00:26.057 --> 00:00:30.745
and&nbsp;asks them to do a ritual called 
Sachiko Ever After so they will stay friends forever.

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:33.639
She tells a&nbsp;folklore story about their school. 

00:00:34.187 --> 00:00:39.429
It used to be&nbsp;an elementary school where an infirmary nurse&nbsp;
was found dead and three students were kidnapped.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.080
Two of them were found dead with missing tongues&nbsp;
and the last one is still missing to this day.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.314
The missing student's name is Sachiko.

00:00:46.618 --> 00:00:50.375
All&nbsp;of a sudden, their teacher opens the door,&nbsp;&nbsp;surprising them.&nbsp;

00:00:50.375 --> 00:00:55.040
Yuka, who is Satoshi’s little sister, also comes to bring him an umbrella.&nbsp;

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.920
All 9 of them decide to do the ritual together.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.462
They say an incantation then 
rip the human doll&nbsp;paper together. 

00:01:01.736 --> 00:01:05.026
They keep those ripped paper as a token of their eternal friendship.

00:01:05.468 --> 00:01:09.336
But not&nbsp;long after that, the building begins shaking and they fall into a hole.

00:01:10.022 --> 00:01:13.977
When they awake, they&nbsp;realize that they are not at their school anymore.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.327
They can’t open any window or door.

00:01:16.555 --> 00:01:20.420
The teacher&nbsp;busts open the classroom door 
and they explore that unknown school.

00:01:20.625 --> 00:01:25.840
On the first floor, they&nbsp;go to the staff room where 
they find out that they are at Tenjin Elementary School. 

00:01:26.174 --> 00:01:29.432
They find&nbsp;a manuscript that explains about the ritual.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.432 --> 00:01:32.480
Those involved get lost in a&nbsp;
dimension separated from ours,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.920
which is the Tenjin Elementary where&nbsp;
children in the serial murder occurred.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:41.900
They hear a noise outside the room, so&nbsp;the teacher 
goes outside to take a look&nbsp;but she sees no one outside. 

00:01:42.357 --> 00:01:46.465
Suddenly, a&nbsp;scary man with a hammer bashes her head,&nbsp;instantly killing her. 

00:01:47.012 --> 00:01:49.250
All of them freak&nbsp;out and scatter away. 

00:01:49.586 --> 00:01:51.865
Satoshi runs away&nbsp;with his sister Yuka.

00:01:52.261 --> 00:01:57.100
She wants to go to the&nbsp;toilet, but not long 
after she goes inside, Satoshi hears her scream.

00:01:57.557 --> 00:02:00.783
When he goes inside,&nbsp;he can not find his sister anywhere. 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:05.760
Instead, he finds a bloody little boy, not&nbsp;
long after that, he also disappears.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:11.082
Naomi and Seiko go to the infirmary room&nbsp;
because Naomi hurts her leg when they run away.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.900
When Naomi falls asleep, Seiko looks at&nbsp;
her closely. 

00:02:15.311 --> 00:02:19.185
She has a feeling for her,&nbsp;but Naomi already has a feeling for Satoshi.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:25.639
When&nbsp;she realizes that Naomi’s student book is missing, 
she leaves her alone in the infirmary&nbsp;room to look for it. 

00:02:26.086 --> 00:02:28.792
When Naomi wakes up,&nbsp;she finds herself alone. 

00:02:29.084 --> 00:02:31.063
She tries to walk but&nbsp;she falls.

00:02:31.429 --> 00:02:37.512
She finds a pendant on the floor, but not long after that 
a bloody little girl&nbsp;appears, so she runs away from the room.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.420
She meets Seiko outside but she is mad and&nbsp;
says mean things to her, making Seiko leave&nbsp;her alone. 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.520
Just after that, she hears a voice&nbsp;
telling her to die which makes her faint.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.292
When Naomi wakes up, she finds Seiko dead, hanging&nbsp;
on a rope in a toilet stall. 

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:55.135
She sits in a corner,&nbsp;contemplating what's happened.

00:02:55.592 --> 00:02:57.955
Satoshi&nbsp;finds her and carries her on his back.

00:02:58.762 --> 00:03:03.841
Ayumi and Yoshiki go to the school reference room&nbsp;
to look for more clues about what is going on.

00:03:03.841 --> 00:03:07.920
She finds out that the school janitor is likely&nbsp;
to be one of the perpetrators of the murder.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.960
When they look at his picture, it turns out to&nbsp;
be the one who killed their teacher earlier.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:18.308
Ayumi finds that there is a reverse incantation&nbsp;
to escape the ritual but the page about it is&nbsp;missing. 

00:03:18.811 --> 00:03:22.709
Ayumi and Yoshiki walk to the janitor's&nbsp;
room to search for more clues.

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.196
On the way there, Ayumi finds Naomi’s missing student book.

00:03:26.607 --> 00:03:29.741
Ayumi&nbsp;and Yoshiki find Mayu talking with 2 children.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.669
Yoshiki tries to grab her away from them, but the children 
drag her away and throw her against&nbsp;a wall, gruesomely killing her. &nbsp;

00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:41.241
They run to the&nbsp;janitor's room where they 
find a tape about the&nbsp;school's paranormal activity. 

00:03:41.424 --> 00:03:46.319
They also find a&nbsp;jar full of tounges, which
 they think are the&nbsp;tounges of the murder victims. 

00:03:46.837 --> 00:03:49.250
They then&nbsp;rush to the staff room to play the tape.

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:55.360
Sakutaro is separated alone, he finds a dead body&nbsp;
splattered to the wall which he finds exciting.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:00.503
But when he realizes that it is the dead body of&nbsp;
Mayu, he freaks out and becomes crazy. &nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:00.854 --> 00:04:03.000
Yuka meets him but she is frightened by him.

00:04:03.228 --> 00:04:04.504
She runs away&nbsp;and hides. 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:08.023
He chases her but the janitor catches him and kills him.

00:04:08.236 --> 00:04:12.078
Yuka is silently hiding,&nbsp;but she is so scared that she wets herself.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.680
A little girl suddenly appears&nbsp;
and tells Yuka to follow her.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.023
Ayumi and Yoshiki are reunited with&nbsp;
Naomi and Satoshi at the staff room.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.042
They watch the tape together.

00:04:22.042 --> 00:04:28.805
The tape contains&nbsp;a video about the manuscript writer 
they found earlier, trying to do the reverse incantation&nbsp;but failed.

00:04:29.049 --> 00:04:32.022
 They find the lost page about the&nbsp;reverse incantation, 

00:04:32.022 --> 00:04:36.456
where it tells them&nbsp;to put back the ripped
 piece of paper and chant the reverse incantation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:36.853 --> 00:04:39.748
 It also tells&nbsp;them to not use other debris as their paper.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.629
Naomi lost hers when her student book fell.

00:04:42.977 --> 00:04:46.209
Ayumi found it but for some reason, she keeps quiet about it.

00:04:46.586 --> 00:04:49.471
She feels jealous of Naomi and&nbsp;Satoshi's relationship.

00:04:49.654 --> 00:04:54.203
She then rips a random&nbsp;paper and gives it to Naomi, 
telling her that&nbsp;it’s Mayu’s paper. 

00:04:54.614 --> 00:04:57.501
They then decide to put back&nbsp;the victim’s tongue to give them peace.

00:04:57.945 --> 00:05:01.069
But Naomi&nbsp;and Satoshi split with them to search for Yuka.

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.250
Ayumi and Yoshiki go to the music room to give&nbsp;
back the victim’s tongue. 

00:05:05.581 --> 00:05:11.520
When they succeed,&nbsp;the victim tells them that the 
real perpetrator&nbsp;of the murders was Sachiko, not the janitor.

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:17.584
Yuka is hiding with the unknown little girl&nbsp;that helped 
her, which turns out to be Sachiko,&nbsp;in the principal room.&nbsp;

00:05:17.584 --> 00:05:19.765
She tells Yuka&nbsp;to sleep for a while.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.167
 When she wakes up,&nbsp;Sachiko ties her with a rope. 

00:05:23.167 --> 00:05:26.080
She stabs&nbsp;her with an umbrella and cuts her tongue.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.471
Ayumi finds her and brings her away while&nbsp;Sachiko laughs. 

00:05:29.745 --> 00:05:35.924
The janitor comes and&nbsp;crushes Yoshiki, but just before he dies, he&nbsp;successfully pierces him with an iron bar.

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:39.746
Naomi is separated from Satoshi when they&nbsp;
chase Sachiko. &nbsp;

00:05:40.035 --> 00:05:43.476
She goes to a screening room&nbsp;where she finds CCTV footage.

00:05:43.735 --> 00:05:47.005
It turns out that&nbsp;she is the one that unconsciously killed Seiko.

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:50.042
She doesn’t remember any of it, but Seiko forgives&nbsp;
her.

00:05:50.455 --> 00:05:54.359
She sees on the CCTV that Satoshi needs help and rushes there to help.

00:05:54.536 --> 00:05:58.209
When Sachiko is going&nbsp;to stab them, she suddenly disappears.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:01.231
A pendant that Naomi picked in the infirmary protects them.

00:06:01.584 --> 00:06:05.248
It gives her vision that the dead infirmary nurse was Sachiko’s mother.

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:07.871
They both were killed by&nbsp;the school principal. 

00:06:08.145 --> 00:06:11.643
He and the janitor then&nbsp;cut her tongue, which started this curse.

00:06:11.856 --> 00:06:14.578
They&nbsp;go to the basement where Sachiko’s remains lie.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.292
They all&nbsp;4 reunite in the basement.

00:06:17.597 --> 00:06:22.289
When Naomi tries&nbsp;to touch Sachiko’s 
remains, she wakes up and strangles Satoshi.

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:27.000
 He beats her with a rock, but&nbsp;
unconsciously, he beats her own sister instead.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:31.502
Naomi gives Sachiko her mom’s 
pendant, making her calm and relieved. &nbsp;

00:06:31.669 --> 00:06:36.816
The building is suddenly&nbsp;shaking vigorously, 
they run away to do the&nbsp;reverse incantation ritual. 

00:06:37.196 --> 00:06:40.125
They hold hands&nbsp;together and chant the reverse incantation.

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.162
Just&nbsp;after that, they come back to the real world.

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:49.040
But since one of the papers was fake, only Ayumi&nbsp;
and Naomi make out alive, holding Satoshi’s hand.
