00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.750
In North Bend Psychiatric Hospital, Tammy
is getting scared of a shadow approaching

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:06.220
her room.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.740
Just then, she is lifted and killed during
the night.

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:11.030
What is happening?

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:12.839
Who is the murderer?

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:14.919
This is Movie Shortens.

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:18.080
Follow us today to the movie titled: The Ward.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.760
Be aware: There are spoilers!

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.340
A young girl in lingerie named Kristen hides
herself from the police.

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.210
She runs to an abandoned house and sets fire.

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.640
Two police officers arrest her regardless
of her discontent.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.910
She is immediately taken to the psychiatric
hospital.

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.920
There are bruises and cuts on her face and
body.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.530
The nurses help her to clean up and dress.

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.510
They tell her supposed to go to jail, not
this hospital.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.059
Kristen follows an orderly called Roy, who
welcomes her to heaven.

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:52.420
He warns her to follow the rules or she'll
be in more trouble.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:58.239
Next, the chief nurse named Lundt takes Kristen
to her room, which was previously Tammy’s.

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:00.989
n
At night, while Kristen is sleeping, her blanket

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.650
is pulled by an unseen force under the bed.

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.280
She wakes up and looks for it, only to find
a broken alphabet charm bracelet.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.090
The following morning, Dr Stringer enters
the room and finds Kristen sleeping on the

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:15.090
floor.

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.650
She tells him that someone took her blanket
during the night.

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:23.090
Stringer asks the nurse Lundt but she says
the door stays closed all the time.

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:28.640
Lundt then tells Kristen to intake some morning
pills but she refuses to, saying she’s not

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:29.640
crazy.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.740
Kristen then trambles the pills, making the
nurse angry.

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:38.829
At noon, Kristen meets with other patients
in the ward: an artistic Iris, a pretty Sarah,

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:42.609
a naughty Emily, and a child-like Zoey.

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:46.289
Roy calls Kristen and takes her to see Dr
Stringer again.

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:50.640
He asks if Kristen can remember anything before
the fire yesterday.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.850
Kristen is confused and says she can’t recall
any memory other than the fire.

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.649
Kristen insists that she is not crazy.

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:00.869
She then secretly steals a knife on the table.

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.359
Before bedtime, Roy watches Kristen until
she swallows all the pills.

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:10.500
Just then, she spits them all out in the pillow
and draws the stolen knife, attempting to

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.290
escape from the ward.

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.890
However, Roy spots and throws her back to
the room.

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:21.040
During the night, Kristen hears some footsteps
and sees a mysterious shadow passing her room.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.120
The next day, Roy brings her casual clothes
and lets her get used to the life in the ward.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.330
Kristen soon befriends other girls.

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.250
While outdoors, Kristen notices a couple looking
at her and the friends.

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.580
Emily tells her that they usually come here
and the girls name them “sad people”.

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:42.050
Emily sings a song, implying that someone
mysterious came into her room.

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:46.900
However, Iris assures Kristen that there is
nothing wrong here as Emily describes.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.450
At night, the girls turn on some music and
have some fun together.

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.870
Kristen becomes more open to her friends.

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.850
Suddenly, a loud thunder strikes and causes
a blackout.

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:02.000
Zoey rushes to hug Kristen, saying that she
hates the dark as it brings bad things.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.420
As the nurse on duty leaves the office, Kristen
sneaks in and checks on the files.

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.819
Emily and Sarah also join her but they find
nothing.

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:12.989
Later, all the girls enjoy the hot shower.

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:16.480
When others are finished, Kristen is left
alone in the bathroom.

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.040
Suddenly, a burnt figure appears and chokes
Kristen.

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.420
She shouts out loud and becomes paranoid.

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.099
Lundt storms in to check on her and decides
to sedate her down with an injection.

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:30.019
Just then, Kristen finds herself in a stretcher.

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:32.269
She is taken to an operating room.

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:36.090
Dr Stringer puts a towel in her mouth, saying
that they won’t hurt her.

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.870
Kristen is then electroshocked and turns to
a blackout.

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.129
The orderlies bring her back to the room after
that.

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:48.530
The following day, Dr Stringer calls the girls
and decides to talk to each one at a time

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.660
about the shower time yesterday.

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.980
Other girls mention Tammy, who was told to
be the only one who can escape out of the

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:55.980
ward.

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:00.440
When Kristen asks about Tammy, Dr Stringer
just ignores and tells others not to talk

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.440
about it.

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.290
Finishing the session therapy, Iris happily
comes in and tells others that today could

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:07.709
be her last therapy session.

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:11.570
She’ll be released soon thanks to her great
progress.

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:16.160
Iris follows a nurse to see Dr Stringer for
the last mental evaluation.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:22.019
In the doctor room, Dr Stringer uses a metronome
to unlock Iris' hidden memories.

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:26.120
When the orderly enters to bring Iris out,
they find her missing.

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:31.889
Elsewhere in the hospital, Iris is secretly
taken away by the unseen figure on a wheelchair.

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:34.180
She is then killed tragically.

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:39.110
Several days later, Kristen keeps asking the
girls and staff about Iris but they say she

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:40.800
has returned home.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.590
Kristen sees Iris’s sketchbook left in her
room and believes that people are lying.

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:50.280
Kristen looks over some of Iris’s portraits
and sees a little girl named Alice.

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:55.479
On the top page, there is a scary figure named
Alice Hudson, which looks exactly like the

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:59.140
ghostly figure that attacked her in the bathroom
the other day.

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:03.199
Thinking about the broken bracelet, Kristen
puts the letters together, which spells out

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:04.690
the name "ALICE".

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:08.310
Later, she confronts Stringer about Alice.

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:11.440
She thinks Alice Hudson is the ghost that
haunts all of them.

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:15.850
Kristen thinks the girl Tammy, little Alice
and Iris were taken away.

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:21.169
However, Dr Stringer denies the idea about
ghosts and tells Kristen to stop over thinking.

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:23.919
Roy is called to bring Kristen back to the
room.

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:26.580
Kristen then confronts the girl about Alice
Hudson.

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:31.830
Emily reveals that Alice Hudson used to have
treatment here but she got out years ago.

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:36.630
Kristen announces to the friends that she’ll
get out of this crazy ward at all cost.

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:41.740
She then asks Zoey to lend her the penny,
which Zoey always holds in her mouth.

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:44.819
At night, Emily and Kristen prepare for the
runaway.

00:05:44.819 --> 00:05:48.880
Nurse Lundt checks carefully if Kristen swallows
all the pills.

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.569
After that, Kristen and Emily escape as planned.

00:05:51.569 --> 00:05:56.230
Kristen uses the coin to open the vent and
the two crawl along to get out.

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:59.169
Meanwhile, Lundt learns about their plan.

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:01.550
The alarm is raised around the hospital.

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:04.130
The two have to hide in an operating room.

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:07.420
As they hear footsteps, Kristen and Emily
separate.

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:11.789
Kristen makes it at the entrance but Alice’s
figure suddenly appears.

00:06:11.789 --> 00:06:17.090
Kristen is knocked out on the floor and Roy
turns out to be the one who hit her.

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:20.139
The next morning, Kristen meets with Emily
again.

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:25.319
While the girls have TV time, Sarah mocks
Emily and Kristen about their failed escape.

00:06:25.319 --> 00:06:28.080
Emily turns the volume up to send Sarah away.

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:32.819
While checking the makeup on a mirror, Sarah
notices Alice’s ghost from behind.

00:06:32.819 --> 00:06:36.940
She shouts out for help but due to the TV
noise, no one can hear her.

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:41.130
Sarah is then taken by Alice and gets electro-shocked
to death.

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:45.259
Meanwhile, Zoey becomes paranoid and continues
to talk about the figure.

00:06:45.259 --> 00:06:50.650
Kristen notices there is a letter “A.H”
on the teddy bear that Zoey always holds by

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:51.650
herself.

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:54.569
She then questions Emily and Zoey about Alice
again.

00:06:54.569 --> 00:06:59.389
The two admit that Tammy teamed up with the
girl and killed Alice because she was bad

00:06:59.389 --> 00:07:01.940
and kept hurting all of them in the past.

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:04.699
Zoey says Alice is after them for revenge.

00:07:04.699 --> 00:07:06.800
Emily becomes scared and runs away.

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.949
Zoey and Kristen chase after her.

00:07:08.949 --> 00:07:11.699
Emily holds a scalpel and intends to commit
suicide.

00:07:11.699 --> 00:07:15.880
Alice’s ghost appears again and slits the
girl in the neck.

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:18.860
Kristen tells Zoey that she’ll help them
out of the ward.

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:24.289
Next, she uses Zoey as a pretend hostage and
threatens the nurse to open the door.

00:07:24.289 --> 00:07:28.379
Lundt follows her but still makes it to raise
the alert around the ward.

00:07:28.379 --> 00:07:31.879
At the elevator, Roy comes in and attacks
Kristen from behind.

00:07:31.879 --> 00:07:34.770
The staff immediately sedate her.

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:37.140
Kristen later is locked in a straitjacket.

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:40.550
Lundt and Roy force her to swallow the medicine.

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:45.050
Just then, she manages to untighten the jacket
and spits all the pills.

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:47.840
Kristen knocks Lundt and a male orderlie.

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:49.650
She takes Zoey with her in the night.

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:52.750
The two run away until they reach a service
elevator.

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:56.560
Kristen lets Zoey in first because it fits
one person at a time.

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:59.590
Zoey is captured by the ghost just after that.

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:01.510
Kristen is then pursued by the ghost.

00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:03.479
At the end, she decides to fight back.

00:08:03.479 --> 00:08:07.159
Eventually, she can destroy Alice's ghost
with an ax.

00:08:07.159 --> 00:08:11.330
Running through the office to find Zoey, Kristen
ends up in Dr Stringer’s room.

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:14.620
She finds a file of Alice Hudson with a detailed
treatment.

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:17.610
There are all the girls’ names in it including
Kristen.

00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:22.650
Dr Stringer enters and tells Kristen the truth:
her real name is Alice Hudson.

00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:26.150
She was kidnapped from her home 8 years ago
by a pervert.

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:31.409
Alice was left chained up for months in the
basement of the same house "Kristen" had fired.

00:08:31.409 --> 00:08:35.160
After the trauma, Alice has suffered from
multiple personality disorder.

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:39.350
She created herself Zoey, Sarah, Iris and
Emily.

00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:43.480
Through experimental techniques, Dr Stringer
claims that the treatments were working until

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:44.600
"Kristen" appeared.

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:49.510
"Kristen" is yet another invention of Alice's
mind to protect itself from reliving the trauma

00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:50.780
at the basement.

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:55.270
Dr Stringer now has to use hypnotherapy to
reawaken Alice's memories.

00:08:55.270 --> 00:09:00.900
Suddenly, Alice's ghost reappears and throws
herself and "Kristen" out of the window.

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:03.660
Just then, Alice returns to her true self.

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:08.270
At the end, the couple looking at Kristen
earlier are her parents.

00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:13.270
Dr Stringer informs that Alice’s cured and
ready to be home under supervision.

00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:17.390
When Alice opens the cabinet, “Kristen”
comes out and attacks her.
