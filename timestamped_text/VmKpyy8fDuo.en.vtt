00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.200
Story Recapped here. Today, I'm going to explain&nbsp;
an action and horror film called "Ready or Not."&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.360
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.240
One stormy night, two frightened boys run inside&nbsp;
a candle-lit Victorian mansion. The older boy,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.440
Daniel, tells his brother, Alex, to hide&nbsp;
in a closet. As soon as he closes the door,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.360
a wounded man named Charles begs Daniel&nbsp;
for help, telling the boy that someone is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.720
trying to kill him. Panic in his eyes,&nbsp;
Daniel alerts his pursuers instead.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.080
Immediately, a group of masked people&nbsp;
clad in formal wear corner him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.160
Charles' bride, Helene, begs for his life&nbsp;
before someone shoots a speargun at him.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.640
Daniel keeps his back to the closet,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.440
protecting his younger brother. A woman&nbsp;
tells Daniel that she's proud of him.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.120
Charles is taken away by the&nbsp;
group. Helene gives up the fight,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.160
taking a deep breath before joining&nbsp;
the people who've taken her husband.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.920
Thirty years later, Grace practices her&nbsp;
wedding vows in front of the mirror.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.440
She enjoys a smoke to calm her nerves&nbsp;
about marrying into the Le Domas family.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.840
Her fiance, Alex, joins her, watching&nbsp;
his family outside and joking about them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.880
Alex believes his family is horrible,&nbsp;
but Grace wants them to accept her.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.480
Alex's brother, Daniel, walks in to collect him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.400
Alex sincerely tells Grace that she can still&nbsp;
escape their family but drops the idea and leaves.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.120
While alone, Alex offers her a chance to leave as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.240
well. She thinks it's a joke and assures&nbsp;
him that she's committed to marrying him.

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.120
While taking wedding photos, Alex's father, Tony,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.480
expresses disapproval over Grace&nbsp;
and Alex's two-year disappearance.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:23.600
Their aunt, Helene, glares at Grace, and&nbsp;
Daniel's wife, Charity, disapproves of her.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.400
Alex's mother, Becky, sees Grace's&nbsp;
unease and tries to lighten up her mood,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.280
saying that she got the same disapproval&nbsp;
when she married into the family.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.440
The rest of the wedding continues without a hitch.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.680
The bride and groom walk down&nbsp;
the aisle with bright smiles.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.560
That evening, Grace and Alex fool around in&nbsp;
his old bedroom. The mood is interrupted by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.120
Helene watching the couple by&nbsp;
the servant's door in the room.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.120
Helene announces that the&nbsp;
family is waiting for them.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.480
Once alone, Alex reveals the family's tradition.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.200
Due to the family's fortune coming&nbsp;
from board games and playing cards,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.240
they play a game at midnight every&nbsp;
time someone joins the Le Domas family.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.240
The game is chosen by drawing a card. Grace&nbsp;
finds it odd but is determined to win the game.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.080
In the dining room, Alex reveals to his&nbsp;
father that he intends to take Grace&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.800
away from the family the following day&nbsp;
and never tell her about their secrets.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.520
Grace explores the mansion on the way to&nbsp;
the music room. Becky welcomes her warmly.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.360
They talk about Grace's foster family and how&nbsp;
she had always wanted to have a permanent family.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.400
Grace reveals that Alex didn't want them to&nbsp;
go through the wedding initially but saw how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.120
important it was to Grace. Becky thanks Grace,&nbsp;
seeing the good she brings out on Alex. Then,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.960
she begs Grace to convince Alex to stay with them.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.200
Concerned about what his mother might say,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.280
Alex pulls Grace away. Grace notices&nbsp;
Alex's nervousness, making her worried.

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:36.880
Alex's sister Emilie, her husband, Fitch, and&nbsp;
their sons, Georgie and Gabe, arrive. Emillie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.560
is ecstatic to meet Grace, but Helene interrupts&nbsp;
the girls, showing disappointment in her niece.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.800
The family enters the game room, which is&nbsp;
full of hunting weapons and animal displays.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.520
Here, Tony tells the story of&nbsp;
the Le Domas' gaming empire.

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.720
Their great-grandfather, a&nbsp;
merchant seaman named Victor,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.840
was dared to solve a puzzle box by an&nbsp;
antique collector named Mr. Le Bail.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.560
Mr. Le Bail promised to finance&nbsp;
any business he wanted if he won.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.520
Victor solved the box and used the money to build&nbsp;
his gaming business. Thus, the family holds the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.720
tradition of letting the box from the story choose&nbsp;
a game to welcome new members to the family.

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.120
Tony hands the box to Grace, telling her&nbsp;
to draw a card from it. Grace takes a card&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.840
and announces the game "Hide and Seek." The&nbsp;
room falls silent, and Alex looks horrified.

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.320
To play the game, Grace must hide from the&nbsp;
family until dawn. But Alex whispers for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.360
her to meet him in their room. Grace&nbsp;
says no; she wants to play for real.

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.080
The cameras are turned off, and the windows and&nbsp;
doors are locked. The family butler, Stevens,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.440
plays a record while Grace finds a&nbsp;
place to hide. Unbeknownst to her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.960
the family arms themselves with hunting weapons&nbsp;
while waiting for the record to countdown.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:34.800
Grace finds a dumbwaiter and hides inside.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.040
Becky advises her son to stay behind,&nbsp;
knowing his worry for his new wife.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.680
They leave Alex in the game room&nbsp;
with Charity guarding the door.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.840
But Alex goes into the servant's corridors to&nbsp;
find Grace. Charity finds the game room empty.

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.120
As they search for Grace, Fitch struggles with&nbsp;
his crossbow. He excuses himself to the bathroom,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.320
feeling nervous about their task.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.320
Quickly bored of the game, Grace crawls out&nbsp;
of the dumbwaiter, ripping her dress when it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:00.080
gets caught. Grace hears the maid, Clara,&nbsp;
looking for Georgie and hides from her.

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:06.080
A hand grabs Grace from behind. It's Alex, pulling&nbsp;
her to hide behind the bed. Clara walks inside,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.440
thinking that Georgie is hiding there.&nbsp;
She hears a crash and peeks out the door.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.040
Grace watches as a bullet hits Clara.

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.040
Emilie excitedly goes into the room,&nbsp;
thinking she got Grace. Tony, Daniel,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.240
Becky, and Helene walk in,&nbsp;
scolding Emilie for her mistake.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:21.360
Grace overhears them talk about a&nbsp;
ritual where they need the bride alive.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:24.800
When they leave with Clara's body, Alex&nbsp;
hurries Grace to pack up and leave.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.080
Grace is still in shock, confused&nbsp;
at what happened. Alex pulls Grace&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.960
into the servant's corridors just&nbsp;
as Emilie comes back for her gun.

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.160
Away from danger, Grace is shaken&nbsp;
with fear as she puts her shoes on.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.480
Alex reveals that, since she&nbsp;
pulled the only bad card,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.080
tradition says that something terrible will&nbsp;
happen to them if they don't sacrifice Grace.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.840
Grace is furious, thinking that he knew she'd&nbsp;
be in danger, but he insists that he didn't.

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.240
Inside the bathroom, Fitch hears&nbsp;
their voices from the vent but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.320
focuses on watching a video on using a crossbow.

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.000
Alex tells her that they would've both died&nbsp;
like his uncle and cousin if they didn't play&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.840
a game after getting married. Alex thought he'd&nbsp;
lose her if he told her about the curse earlier.

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.280
After expressing his love, Alex&nbsp;
instructs Grace to wait for him in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.760
the service kitchen while he unlocks&nbsp;
the doors from the security room.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.560
To move easier, Grace rips the bottom of her&nbsp;
dress. She finds herself between two doors,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.000
not knowing which one leads to the kitchen.

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:12.480
Tony and Daniel carry Clara's body when&nbsp;
Grace walks into the hallway behind them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:16.480
She runs to the other side, where Emilie&nbsp;
frantically fires at her, missing entirely.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:20.080
Grace escapes to the study room. She&nbsp;
tries the phone, but it doesn't work.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:23.840
She hears a sound nearby and hides, only&nbsp;
for Daniel to walk in from her door.

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:28.240
Grace is frozen in fear. But Daniel&nbsp;
pours himself a drink. He gives her a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.080
10-second head start before calling for his&nbsp;
family. Grace runs as Daniel counts down.

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.480
Daniel finally announces her location.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:38.800
Charity is disappointed that he lost Grace.&nbsp;
Daniel questions his wife's morality,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.400
but Charity reminds him of her past, saying&nbsp;
she'd rather die than lose what she has now.

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.840
The rest of the family joins them. Daniel despises&nbsp;
how they act as if what they're doing was normal.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:52.400
When Emilie notices her gun missing, Fitch offers&nbsp;
his crossbow. Another maid, Tina, tells the family&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.880
she saw Grace, but Emilie pulls the trigger on&nbsp;
the crossbow, hitting her. Tina moans in pain,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:01.840
interrupting Helene's speech. Frustrated, Helene&nbsp;
swings her ax on the maid, ending her misery.

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:05.840
Becky suggests using the cameras. The others&nbsp;
agree, but Helene wants to stick to tradition.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:10.000
The family argues before finally deciding&nbsp;
to use the cameras to find Grace and Alex.

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:14.960
Grace goes into the game room and takes a shotgun&nbsp;
and ammunition. Seeing herself in the mirror,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.240
she's disturbed at what she's become.

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:19.840
Alex reaches the security room just&nbsp;
as Grace enters the service kitchen.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:24.480
Seeing that the door is still locked, she attempts&nbsp;
to shoot at the lock, but the gun isn't loaded.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.000
She hears whistling nearby and hides.

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:30.960
In a hallway, Daniel notices the cameras are&nbsp;
back on, suspecting that Alex turned them on.

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:33.440
Back in the kitchen, Stevens is preparing tea.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:37.440
Grace crawls quietly, avoiding him. She&nbsp;
loads the shotgun as quietly as she can.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:40.880
She locks the gun with a click as Stevens&nbsp;
starts singing and the kettle whistles.

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:45.600
The lock on the door is disabled, alerting the&nbsp;
two. Grace aims her gun at the butler, demanding&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:50.400
him to let her go. She pulls the trigger, but&nbsp;
the ammunition is fake. Grace slams the teapot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:54.640
on Stevens' face. He swings a kitchen knife to&nbsp;
block her, prompting Grace to find another way.

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:57.760
In the security room, Alex destroys&nbsp;
the controls with a fire extinguisher&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:00.800
just as his father enters. Alex&nbsp;
chokes Tony, threatening him to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:04.320
let Grace go. Daniel calms his brother&nbsp;
down, allowing Tony to knock Alex out.

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:09.520
Grace hears Tony and Daniel from afar. She opens&nbsp;
the dumbwaiter to hide but finds the last maid,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:14.080
Dora, inside. Grace assures her that the family&nbsp;
is looking for her, not Dora. Instead of letting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:17.840
her hide, Dora yells for the family to get Grace.&nbsp;
Her hands accidentally press on the dumbwaiter's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:21.840
button, starting it. Dora gets crushed&nbsp;
inside, despite Grace's attempts to save her.

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:26.560
In the bedroom, Tony handcuffs Alex to the&nbsp;
bed. Stevens announces that the windows and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:30.240
doors are unlocked and that Dora is also&nbsp;
dead. Tony goes ballistic at the news.

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:33.760
Grace listens from outside the window with&nbsp;
the others gone as Helene claims that it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:37.760
Tony's fault that Alex lost his way. Tony&nbsp;
argues that Alex always hated the family,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:40.720
but Helene believes that Alex is&nbsp;
just afraid of who he truly is.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:44.880
Helene recounts how she regrets trying to save her&nbsp;
husband, and she should've done the deed herself.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:47.680
Alex is the only one who'd seen&nbsp;
Mr. Le Bail when he was a child,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:51.200
leading Helene to believe that he would lead&nbsp;
their family and would betray Grace in the end.

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:54.640
Downstairs, Fitch chats with a&nbsp;
friend on his phone. Grace drops,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:56.560
appearing on the window behind&nbsp;
him, but he doesn't notice.

00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:01.360
Finally, out of the house, Grace runs down&nbsp;
what was her wedding aisle. She heads for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:05.440
the gate but stops when she sees someone with a&nbsp;
flashlight outside. She hides in the barn just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:09.120
as the other person enters. Grace waits for&nbsp;
the person, only to find that it's Georgie.

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:13.120
She is relieved to see the boy, she walks&nbsp;
up to him, but he shoots her on the hand.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:17.440
Grace stifles a scream before knocking the boy&nbsp;
unconscious. A goat startles her, causing her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:22.000
to fall into a pit where the dead bodies of&nbsp;
the previous sacrifices are disposed of. Grace&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.160
struggles to climb up a ladder with an injured&nbsp;
hand, hurting her hand further with a nail.

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:30.320
Smoking outside, Charity spots Grace&nbsp;
running. She shoots her but misses.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:32.640
Charity goes inside and&nbsp;
informs Stevens where Grace is.

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:37.680
Grace reaches the fence but can't climb&nbsp;
due to her injuries. A car drives nearby.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:41.520
Grace desperately squeezes between the fence and&nbsp;
asks the driver for help, but he ignores her and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:45.920
drives away. She sees another car coming from&nbsp;
the Le Domas estate, and she hides in the woods.

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:49.600
Stevens reports that Grace has gotten&nbsp;
out. Daniel jokes about the situation,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:52.960
angering his father. Tony reminds&nbsp;
him that if Grace lives by morning,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:56.560
they will all die, as another family did&nbsp;
after failing a deal with Mr. Le Bail.

00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:59.440
Back in the bedroom, Alex uses his&nbsp;
handcuffs to grind himself free.

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:03.440
Emilie and Daniel dispose of the maids&nbsp;
in the pit. Tired of their deeds,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:08.000
Daniel thinks that their family deserves to die.&nbsp;
Emilie argues that her kids don't deserve that.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.840
They find Georgie, who tells them that he shot&nbsp;
Grace because that's what everyone was doing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:14.800
Emilie tells her son she's proud of&nbsp;
him, strengthening Daniel's belief.

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:20.320
Stevens chases Grace on a clearing, tackling her&nbsp;
down. Grace refuses to give up, choking him until&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:24.320
he collapses. She takes the car to escape,&nbsp;
not noticing that Stevens is still alive.

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:28.320
In the car, Grace calls the vehicle&nbsp;
assistance company for help. But the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:32.320
vehicle has been reported stolen, and the&nbsp;
agent shuts it down remotely. The car stops&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:35.840
in the middle of the road, allowing Stevens&nbsp;
to catch up and shoot her with a tranquilizer.

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:40.080
Grace wakes up in the car with Stevens driving.&nbsp;
In a video call with the butler, the Le Domas&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:44.640
family is glad that Grace is being brought back.&nbsp;
Stevens turns up the radio's music in celebration,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:48.240
not hearing the family's warnings. Grace kicks&nbsp;
him in the face, causing the car to crash.

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:51.840
Grace climbs out of the overturned&nbsp;
car, but Daniel finds her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:55.360
He admits that he likes Grace, but he&nbsp;
can't let his entire family die for her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:58.400
He knocks her out with a gun, then tells&nbsp;
his father to come out from hiding.

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:03.200
In the bedroom, Alex is still&nbsp;
handcuffed when his mother joins him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:06.880
She informs him that they got Grace. Becky&nbsp;
laments that she doesn't want to hurt Grace,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:11.200
but her family comes first. Alex says the curse&nbsp;
is not real, and Becky chuckles -- he wouldn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:15.200
have let Grace pull a card if he didn't believe in&nbsp;
the curse. Alex tells his mother that he left them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:19.280
because he was tired of the family's sadistic&nbsp;
traditions. He expresses his love for Grace,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:22.800
saying that he chooses her over his&nbsp;
family. Becky doubts this, however.

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:26.080
Grace wakes up on a sacrificial table&nbsp;
with Tony chanting above her head.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:29.440
Daniel hands his father the ritual wine,&nbsp;
which the family passes down to drink.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:34.160
Grace screams under her mufflers,&nbsp;
watching as Tony lifts a blade over her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:37.440
Before he could stab her, however,&nbsp;
Tony and the rest start vomiting blood.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:41.760
Daniel frees Grace just as Alex&nbsp;
is finally off his handcuffs.

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:51.040
Daniel hides with Grace, but Charity holds&nbsp;
them at gunpoint. She shoots her husband,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:53.760
angering Grace, who steals the&nbsp;
gun and smacks her on the head.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:56.720
Grace goes to comfort Daniel,&nbsp;
but he insists that she leaves.

00:10:56.720 --> 00:11:00.640
Tony finds Grace, but she is no longer&nbsp;
scared. She grabs a lantern and knocks him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:04.960
down. The lantern falls and burns a curtain.&nbsp;
Becky shoots an arrow at Grace but misses.

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:09.200
Alex finds Daniel dying on the floor,&nbsp;
begging that he still needs his brother.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:11.360
He sits next to Daniel's body in grief.

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:14.880
Becky chokes Grace. Grace grabs the&nbsp;
table cloth, letting the puzzle box fall.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:19.120
Crazed, Grace fights back, hitting&nbsp;
Becky repeatedly with the puzzle box.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:21.600
She stops when Alex calls&nbsp;
her, seeing his mother's body.

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:26.480
Now uncertain if he's still on her side,&nbsp;
Grace backs away from her husband. Alex cries,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:30.480
mentioning that his brother is dead. He asks Grace&nbsp;
if she'd stay with him after all that happened,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:35.040
but she doesn't answer. Alex touches her face,&nbsp;
and Grace finds comfort in him. Then he holds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:39.120
her head tight, finally coming to a decision.&nbsp;
Alex grabs Grace and calls for his family.

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:43.200
The remaining members of the family&nbsp;
come. Emilie and Tony mourn for Becky,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:45.280
but Helene pushes them to continue the ritual.

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:49.840
With the two boys watching, the adults hold Grace&nbsp;
down. Alex looks down on his wife with a knife in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:55.040
hand. Grace looks up at him, pleading, but he&nbsp;
made his choice. Alex plunges the knife down.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:57.840
But Grace pulls her arm, letting&nbsp;
him stab her shoulder instead.

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:02.640
The confusion forces the rest to release&nbsp;
her. She wails, aiming the knife at them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:06.720
Helene draws out the curtains. The sun has&nbsp;
risen, causing Fitch and Tony to flinch.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:10.000
Helene begs for forgiveness from&nbsp;
Mr. Le Bail from his empty chair.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.840
They wait for the worst, but nothing happens.&nbsp;
Fitch laughs while the others are confused.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:18.800
Helene thinks that Mr. Le Bail has given them&nbsp;
a second chance. She goes to attack Grace,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:20.240
but she explodes in front of everyone.

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:26.560
The record starts playing as the house burns down.&nbsp;
Fitch, Charity, Emilie, and the boys die. Tony&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:31.040
challenges Mr. Le Bail, arguing that he'd been&nbsp;
loyal his whole life. This still doesn't save him.

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:36.320
Grace laughs at the family's demise. With Alex&nbsp;
the only one left, he apologizes to her, but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:42.320
Grace denies him. She removes her ring and throws&nbsp;
it at him. Alex explodes. Grace, tired and fed up,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:46.240
wipes the blood away. She looks at the chair&nbsp;
and sees a glimpse of Mr. Le Bail saluting her.

00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:51.040
Grace leaves the burning mansion and sits on&nbsp;
the steps. She smokes a cigarette she took&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:55.440
from Becky's body. Sirens approach&nbsp;
the estate. Help finally arrived.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:59.280
An officer asks her what happened.&nbsp;
Taking in a puff, she answers, "In-laws."
