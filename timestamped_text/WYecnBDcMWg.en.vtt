00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.699
Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:07.050
Today, I'm going to explain an action, adventure,
and drama film called "Ravenous."

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:08.500
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.570
Watch out and take care.

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:14.309
Ravenous zombies have started to terrorize
a rural village in northern Quebec due to

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.309
an inexplicable outbreak.

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.130
The mysterious phenomenon was first noticed
at a race track while a driver was fooling

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.119
around with a staff member.

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:25.900
While they're kissing passionately, the driver
catches a pale-looking woman staring at them

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.130
intently.

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.109
When he asks her what she wants, the pale-looking
woman rushes towards them and bites the race

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.720
track crew on the neck.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:37.079
The driver looks on in shock for a brief moment
before he starts calling for help.

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.420
With the plague spreading like wildfire, survivors
have to roam around and try to find people

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.410
who haven't been infected.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.280
One of the few remaining survivors is an elderly
man named Réal, who runs as fast as he can

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.149
to get away from the three zombies chasing
him.

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:56.329
Somewhere in the village, a young boy named
Ti-Cul wipes the tears from his eyes as he

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:58.170
prepares to leave his home.

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.809
But before leaving, he sets a horse free and
grabs a rifle lying next to a freshly dug

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:03.829
grave.

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:10.580
In the woods, Bonin and Vézina entertain
themselves with doctor jokes as they keep

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.750
watch for infected people.

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:19.420
Meanwhile, Céline drives around in the village
in her car, searching for zombies to kill.

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.600
When no one turns up, she stops the car and
turns on the radio full-blast to attract the

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.750
attention of any infected people in the vicinity.

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.579
She immediately grabs her machete when she
sees someone emerge from a house.

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:35.500
Céline furiously attacks the zombie as its
blood splashes on the car's rear windshield.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.499
While she tries to calm down, an infected
boy suddenly appears beside the vehicle and

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:40.960
stares at her.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.770
Without a second thought, she drives away
and leaves the boy behind.

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.189
While Bonin and Vézina are driving back to
their camp, Vézina suddenly notices a mother

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:51.759
and a girl in the woods standing on the path.

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:55.590
He recognizes them and says that the girl
went to school with his child.

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.420
As Vézina approaches them, Bonin calls out
to him, telling him to leave them and deal

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.219
with them some other time.

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:06.409
Vézina hesitates to shoot them, fearing that
the noise would attract other infected people.

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:10.420
When he hears a faint wail, he goes deeper
into the woods to investigate.

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.180
Bonin suddenly notices that the mother is
gone, leaving the girl alone on the path.

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.099
As Vézina walks around the woods, he sees
a boy hiding up on a tree.

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:22.569
But before he could get a closer look, he
suddenly hears the woman chuckling behind

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:23.569
him.

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:26.120
Bonin soon hears a shriek followed by a gunshot.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.080
With a bite on his neck, Vézina pumps his
shotgun and shoots the mother as she lay on

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.220
the ground.

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.510
More zombies turn up behind Vézina, so he
starts running back to the pickup truck.

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.360
Back in the woods, Réal manages to kill one
of the zombies after him.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.290
Two other zombies run towards him, but he
no longer feels like running.

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.280
As the zombies get closer, Ti-cul arrives
and shoots them with his rifle.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.750
Réal, who has been bitten, tells Ti-cul that
he had hesitated to kill the zombie because

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.060
she was his wife.

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.430
He goes on to say that the other two zombies
that Ti-cul just shot were his sons.

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.569
Bonin and Vézina stop at a field to catch
their breath.

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:04.360
Vézina says he would've withdrawn all his
money from the bank and taken his child to

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.580
Disneyland if he knew that an outbreak like
this would happen.

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.780
On the other hand, Bonin says that he would've
approached a girl named Katy and confessed

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.810
that he's infatuated with her.

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.900
As Bonin keeps going, Vézina falls silent.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.950
Later, Bonin gets back on the road, saddened
by the loss of his friend.

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:26.360
Meanwhile, Céline stops by a house to check
if there's any fuel in the oil tank outside.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:33.209
Two elderly women, named Pauline and Thérèse,
appear and tell her to strip at gunpoint to

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:34.950
see if she's been bitten.

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:39.120
As Pauline checks Céline's body for bite
marks, Thérèse inspects her vehicle.

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.040
Pauline, seeing nothing suspicious about Céline,
decides to offer her a beer.

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.730
Céline tells them that they were the first
survivors that she encountered in weeks.

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.909
Thérèse lets her know that she can stay
with them as long as she wants.

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:55.569
Bonin stops by a hunting camp where he meets
another survivor.

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:59.030
After the other man learns what happened to
Vézina, he goes to the back of the truck

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:00.650
to chop up the body.

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.220
He asks Bonin if Thérèse already knows what
happened to her boy.

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.430
Bonin says he hasn't told her yet.

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.709
The man reveals that he has tied up a woman
inside his cabin because she's been bitten.

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:15.219
The woman, named Tania, claims that a dog
bit her.

00:04:15.219 --> 00:04:19.260
The cabin owner tells Bonin to avoid making
too much noise with his truck and heads out

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.350
to the woods armed with a rifle.

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.990
Bonin enters the cabin and starts telling
Tania what will happen once the infection

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.990
spreads.

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:30.080
At first, the infected will feel nauseous,
and then they'll notice blotches on their

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.080
skin.

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.030
Soon, they'll start feeling stronger until
they see themselves chewing on other people's

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:36.250
organs.

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.170
Tania tries to speak with a gag in her mouth,
so Bonin removes it.

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:44.480
She then tells him that the man plugged her
ears, so she didn't hear anything he said.

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:48.820
The woman begs him to release her, reiterating
that a dog bit her, but Bonin ignores her

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:50.920
and goes back outside.

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:55.860
Bonin suddenly hears the cabin owner scream,
so he goes back to the shack to untie Tania.

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.210
When they hear another scream, Bonin opens
the door, activating the chime.

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:04.250
He quickly takes the key off the ignition,
realizing that the sound would attract the

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:05.250
zombies.

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:08.610
Tania gets into the truck quietly, carrying
her accordion with her.

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:12.980
Soon after Bonin starts the truck, the cabin
owner jumps in front of the windshield.

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:16.260
Other zombies emerge from the woods as Bonin
drives away.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:20.820
Just when they think they were safe, the infected
cabin owner grabs Tania from the back.

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:23.440
Bonin yells at her to take the gun and shoot
him.

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:27.580
She screams as she pumps the shotgun and shoots
the cabin owner in the head.

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:32.580
Later, Bonin stops by on the side of the road
to get rid of the cabin owner's body.

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:36.120
Bonin tells Tania that he's never seen her
around the village before.

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.080
She says that her father owns a cabin on Trout
Lake.

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.800
As they prepare to leave, Bonin decides to
wait for a while to make sure they wouldn't

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.520
attract any zombies when they start the engine.

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:50.960
But as they wait, a man named Demers suddenly
jumps out beside the truck and yells out to

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.100
scare them.

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:57.150
Demers, having no idea that about the outbreak,
tells Bonin that someone tried to bite him.

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:01.160
Demers then goes on his way to surprise his
family without any clue that most people in

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.020
the village are now infected.

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:07.880
Réal tells Ti-cul that he regrets his decision
not to flee from the village sooner.

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.480
When his family started to chase him, all
he could think of was turning around and telling

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:12.670
them he loves them.

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:17.150
Réal thinks that it was a stupid idea, but
Ti-Cul argues that it was not.

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:21.010
The boy recalls when he shot his family after
the infection spread to their home.

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:25.780
His mother, who was bitten on the neck, is
heartbroken as she looks at the lifeless bodies

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:28.200
of his father and sister on the ground.

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:32.510
She slowly turns to Ti-Cul and forces a smile
before turning back to the corpses.

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:36.770
Ti-Cul puts on a brave face as he points the
gun at her and shoots.

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:40.720
Bonin and Tania stop by a farm to look for
suppliers after hearing from Demers that the

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.050
owner had turned into a zombie.

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:47.370
Inside the house, Tania hears thumping sounds
around the house, so she quietly walks around

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:49.220
to see where the sound came from.

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:52.430
Tania comes across a room and listens through
the door.

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:55.310
She hears nothing, so she decides to open
it.

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:58.420
As the door creaks, Tania hears someone running.

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:01.950
Inside the room, she finds a young girl trying
to hide from her.

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:05.780
As Tania cleans up the white powder smeared
on the girl's face, she starts warming up

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:06.800
to her.

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:10.880
On the road, Bonin tries to make the girl
laugh by telling one of Vézina's jokes to

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:11.880
her.

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:17.820
The girl, named Zoé, just smiles at him,
while Tania gives him an irritated look.

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:22.520
When they stop by a camper van to rest, they
hear a woman on the C.B. radio, looking for

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:23.520
"little pup."

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:28.380
Tania asks Bonin who she was referring to,
but he ignores her and gets out of the truck.

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:33.120
The following day, Tania relieves herself
outside and accidentally steps on a mousetrap,

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:34.870
causing it to snap.

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:38.600
Soon she hears other traps snapping around
her, followed by an eerie shriek.

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:43.260
Tania immediately crouches down on the ground
and carefully looks around for any signs of

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:44.260
zombies.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:48.020
When she turns around, she sees an infected
man turning in her direction, so she lies

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:50.100
down and slowly crawls away.

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:55.130
To Tania's shock, the zombie suddenly turns
up beside her, so she runs away screaming.

00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:59.940
The zombie soon catches up to Tania and tackles
her, but Bonin grabs it and stabs it repeatedly

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:02.300
as soon as it tries to bite her.

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:07.320
Later on, Tania starts ranting about her frustrations,
saying she would be selling adult toys with

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:11.700
Katy in a bikini on a hot day like this, but
because of the plague, she'll never see her

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:12.700
again.

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:17.470
When Tania gets inside the truck, Zoé tells
her that she also misses her cousin Ti-Guy.

00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:22.080
They all fall silent, but their peace is soon
broken by Demers, who suddenly jumps out beside

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:24.030
the truck to scare them again.

00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:29.100
Demers warn them that something is happening
on Route 8, so Bonin decides to check it out.

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:33.500
When they get there, Bonin sees zombies gathered
around a tower of stacked furniture.

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:37.189
Before he could leave, an infected man sees
him and shrieks to call the attention of other

00:08:37.189 --> 00:08:38.319
zombies.

00:08:38.319 --> 00:08:42.810
Tania gets out of the truck to check on Bonin,
but she turns back when she sees him running.

00:08:42.810 --> 00:08:46.529
Zoé immediately turns the ignition as soon
as she sees them.

00:08:46.529 --> 00:08:51.250
Bonin drives the truck in reverse, with the
infected people watching them as they leave.

00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:55.560
Bonin decides to go to Thérèse's place and
tell them what happened to Vézina.

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:59.110
Thérèse slaps Bonin in the face and drops
down to the ground crying upon hearing the

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:00.629
news about her boy.

00:09:00.629 --> 00:09:04.740
Pauline recalls that the number of infected
people has thinned in the last few weeks,

00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:07.120
but now they seem to be multiplying again.

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:11.190
Pauline surmises that the infected people
had nothing to eat outside the village, so

00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:12.350
they returned.

00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:16.189
Tania asserts that someone probably blocked
the roads to prevent them from reaching the

00:09:16.189 --> 00:09:17.310
cities.

00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:21.290
Pauline suggests that they should just barricade
the house and keep quiet to avoid attracting

00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:23.000
the zombies' attention.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.830
She goes on to disclose that they have to
ration their food since they are running low,

00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:31.040
but she assures Zoé that she can eat as much
as she needs to because she's still growing.

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:34.709
Céline warns them that the house is on the
path of the infected people who seem to be

00:09:34.709 --> 00:09:36.240
gathering together.

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:40.100
She suggests making the long journey to a
bunker that will keep them safe.

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:44.370
The group soon draws up their plans and gathers
up all food that they can carry.

00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:48.580
Later that night, the group starts discussing
their concern about Tania's bite.

00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:52.750
Bonin tries to defend her, telling them it's
just a dog bite, but Céline points out that

00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:54.600
he didn't actually see it happen.

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:58.610
Tania tells the group to include her before
they make any decisions about her.

00:09:58.610 --> 00:10:03.019
Later on, they start hearing the snaps of
the traps they laid out in the woods.

00:10:03.019 --> 00:10:06.319
Zombies soon begin running toward the house,
so they head out immediately.

00:10:06.319 --> 00:10:10.750
They soon end up in the woods, so they keep
quiet as they hide in the bushes and trees.

00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:16.250
Bonin, however, is out in the open with several
infected people chasing after him, so he has

00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:18.279
no choice but to use his shotgun.

00:10:18.279 --> 00:10:22.800
A zombie suddenly grabs Tania from behind
while she's hiding with Zoé.

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:26.870
As she struggles to break free, Zoé stabs
the zombie on the back of the neck, allowing

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:28.790
Tania to get up and kill it.

00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:33.120
When another zombie appears in front of them,
Céline attacks it with her machete.

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:36.920
The group goes ahead with their journey and
comes across a river, where they encounter

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:38.470
Ti-Cul and Réal.

00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:42.310
Bonin notices the bite on Réal's thigh, so
the two decide to go on their way without

00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:44.170
introducing themselves.

00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:47.959
The group comes across a farm along the way,
so they start discussing whether they should

00:10:47.959 --> 00:10:50.190
go through it or use another route.

00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:54.230
Bonin notes that they could follow the river,
but it will add another day to their journey.

00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:57.910
Pauline agrees to go down the river despite
the heavy toll that it will put on her, so

00:10:57.910 --> 00:10:59.769
they all move on.

00:10:59.769 --> 00:11:03.510
Along the way, Demers suddenly jumps out from
the bushes and yells at the group to scare

00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:05.959
them, causing Tania to shoot him.

00:11:05.959 --> 00:11:10.230
As Tania tries to explain, Bonin tells her
that Demers had already been bitten, so she

00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:12.220
has nothing to worry about.

00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:15.850
The group soon comes across another tower
of furniture with a few zombies gathering

00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:19.130
around it, so they try to pass through as
quietly as they can.

00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:22.740
Meanwhile, Réal and Ti-Cul watch them from
a distance.

00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:27.649
Zoé and Bonin run toward a pile of furniture
to hide, but Zoé trips on a pail, catching

00:11:27.649 --> 00:11:29.690
the attention of an infected woman.

00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:33.319
Zoé stands still to avoid agitating the zombie.

00:11:33.319 --> 00:11:37.790
Réal helps Zoé out by standing still in
front of her to keep her out of the zombie's

00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:38.790
view.

00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:43.040
After introducing themselves to the group,
Réal and Ti-Cul join them in their journey.

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:47.170
The group stops by an abandoned house, where
they find a note warning them not to go into

00:11:47.170 --> 00:11:48.170
town.

00:11:48.170 --> 00:11:52.199
The letter further states that the author
goes to Route 113 daily to look for other

00:11:52.199 --> 00:11:53.370
survivors.

00:11:53.370 --> 00:11:57.259
The author ends the note by signing it as
Number 79.

00:11:57.259 --> 00:12:00.959
Outside the house, Bonin discovers a pile
of bones under a tree.

00:12:00.959 --> 00:12:03.430
The group is suddenly startled when they hear
screams.

00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:07.309
Réal had finally turned into a zombie and
bit Ti-Cul on the neck.

00:12:07.309 --> 00:12:10.389
Céline runs over to them and kills Réal.

00:12:10.389 --> 00:12:13.670
Outside the house, they discover that another
zombie has bitten Pauline.

00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:18.330
Thérèse looks at Pauline in shock, but she
soon regains her composure and shoots the

00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:19.689
zombie twice.

00:12:19.689 --> 00:12:23.910
In the woods, Céline tells Ti-Cul that he
went out for a manicure when her family got

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:24.910
infected.

00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:29.480
She had played the ideal wife until that time,
but due to the outbreak, she's no longer concerned

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:31.089
about being perfect.

00:12:31.089 --> 00:12:34.770
As she tells her story to Ti-Cul, She shows
him a picture of her family.

00:12:34.770 --> 00:12:38.829
Ti-Cul tells her that his real name is Rémi
Latraverse.

00:12:38.829 --> 00:12:42.740
Céline then walks out of the woods alone
and goes back to the house to clean up the

00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:43.850
blood on her face.

00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:47.709
Thérèse asks Pauline if she put too much
dill in the pickles that they brought on their

00:12:47.709 --> 00:12:48.709
journey.

00:12:48.709 --> 00:12:51.060
Pauline says she doesn't think so.

00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:54.220
She then turns to Thérèse and nods, hinting
that she's ready.

00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:58.810
Thérèse tries to hold back her tears as
she points her shotgun at Pauline.

00:12:58.810 --> 00:13:02.660
They soon come across a building, but they
couldn't find anything useful, so they soon

00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:04.080
head back out.

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:07.620
While they are walking through the woods,
they start hearing the cries of a baby echoing

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:09.279
through the misty forest.

00:13:09.279 --> 00:13:13.320
They follow the sound and come across an infected
woman holding a crying doll.

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:17.709
A few steps away from the infected woman,
they discover a tower of chairs.

00:13:17.709 --> 00:13:20.779
Meanwhile, zombies have begun to line up around
them.

00:13:20.779 --> 00:13:24.680
When the infected woman pulls the string of
the crying doll, Céline takes aim to slash

00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:26.230
her with a machete.

00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:30.120
She hacks the infected woman when the zombie
suddenly screams and alerts the other infected

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:32.089
people of their presence.

00:13:32.089 --> 00:13:36.011
As the whole herd runs toward them, Bonin
carries Zoé away, hoping to take her to a

00:13:36.011 --> 00:13:37.139
safe place.

00:13:37.139 --> 00:13:41.370
Thérèse stays behind and just watches them
take off as the zombies grab her.

00:13:41.370 --> 00:13:45.740
Céline starts hacking away at the herd of
infected people running toward her.

00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:50.249
Bonin decides to hand over Zoé to Tania and
lead the zombies away from them.

00:13:50.249 --> 00:13:54.869
Despite being bitten numerous times, Céline
continues to slash the zombies with her machete.

00:13:54.869 --> 00:13:58.940
Meanwhile, Tania takes Zoé into a tunnel
and tells her that she's the strongest among

00:13:58.940 --> 00:13:59.940
them.

00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:04.329
Tania leaves the child in the tunnel as the
zombies continue to ravage their victims.

00:14:04.329 --> 00:14:08.800
An infected man soon enters the tunnel where
Zoé is hiding, but Tania arrives and plays

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:11.819
her accordion to lead the zombie away from
her.

00:14:11.819 --> 00:14:15.790
When everything goes quiet, Zoé goes back
to the building and sees Bonin preparing to

00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:17.680
shoot himself with a shotgun.

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:21.819
Bonin, who has been bitten, tells Zoé to
leave him behind and find Tania.

00:14:21.819 --> 00:14:26.160
Later, Zoé leaves the building on her own,
carrying a shotgun.

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:29.930
As she walks through a field, she finds Tania's
accordion on the ground.

00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:32.279
She brings it with her and leaves the gun
behind.

00:14:32.279 --> 00:14:38.069
Zoé continues walking until she reaches Route
113, where she decides to sit and wait.

00:14:38.069 --> 00:14:42.680
Soon, she hears the noise of an engine and
sees a formula one car approaching.

00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:47.399
The racecar driver, wearing a jacket with
the number 79, gets out of the vehicle and

00:14:47.399 --> 00:14:49.199
walks toward Zoé.

00:14:49.199 --> 00:14:53.490
She smiles at the man and warns him not to
continue driving down the road he's heading.

00:14:53.490 --> 00:15:05.529
The man thanks Zoé and takes her for a ride
in his car to go to a much safer place.
