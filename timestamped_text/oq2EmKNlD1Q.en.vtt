00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.190
Welcome back to Movie Recaps.

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.049
Today I will show you a sci-fi, thriller film
from 2018, titled Replicas.

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:08.200
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.450
Watch out and take care.

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.100
A helicopter carrying a precious load flies
onto the island of Arecibo, Puerto Rico.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.740
William is waiting in his office for the cargo
to arrive.

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:22.070
The helicopter lands on the property of Bionyne
Industries and instantly the entire facility

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.279
is being informed of its arrival.

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:27.749
William joins Scott and Margaret as they walk
toward the experimental laboratory.

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:30.880
He asks them if the donor has signed the necessary
documents.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.340
Ed hears the announcement, grabs his things
and heads on there as well.

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.880
The donor is being placed and unpacked in
the laboratory next to a robot body.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.450
William and Ed talk about the details of the
donors death, then proceed with the experiment.

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.210
Ed checks the donor's cortex activity and
declares him to be viable.

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.690
William concurs with the findings and tells
everyone that his biological brain will be

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.160
replicated inside of a synthetic brain.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.990
He tells Ed to begin the process.

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:58.990
The neural probe designed to perform the task
is engaged and the process of transferring

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:00.960
the soldier's brain begins.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.570
William initiates the neural imprint and works
on the application of the human mind onto

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:05.909
the synthetic one.

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.090
He activates all of the functions of the mind
and tells Margaret to energize the body.

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.659
The replica awakens and William addresses
it by name as it starts moving.

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:18.180
It asks who he is and William explains that
he has transitioned into a synthetic brain.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.619
While coming online, it begins to freak out
and rip itself apart, tearing out part by

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.380
part, until William shuts the subject down.

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.369
William speaks to Jones about the progress
they've just had.

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:31.461
Jones isn't impressed that the subject spoke
for the first time and tells him that they

00:01:31.461 --> 00:01:35.079
need bigger results to hold onto the shareholders
of the company.

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:38.999
William tells him that his family had made
too many sacrifices for his life's work.

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:42.009
He promises Jones that he is very close to
a breakthrough.

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:45.969
Later, William drives home and meets his wife
Mona in front of the house packing the car

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:47.100
for a trip.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.719
He rushes inside and sees that his kids Matt,
Zoey and Sophie aren't packed yet either.

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:55.549
Ed walks into their house and Sophie gives
him her pet fish, telling him not to overfeed

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:56.549
him.

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.499
He asks William if he talked to Jones and
if he got fired yet.

00:01:59.499 --> 00:02:03.790
Mona overhears them talking as Ed explains
that the subject ripped itself apart.

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.770
However, William interrupts him and tells
her that it spoke.

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.920
She says that if it could speak then it could
also feel and that he shouldn't bring people

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.200
from the dead until he works everything out.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.750
Since, Mona is a doctor she doesn't like that
people might be suffering in his trials.

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.180
They pack the car and he tells her that he's
on the verge of a breakthrough, but something

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.819
is preventing the synthetic to achieve consciousness.

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:25.510
Mona says that they might be missing a soul.

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.360
William doesn't think so, saying that it's
all neurochemistry.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.390
She hates his answer and tells him that maybe
he's loosing sight of what's right and wrong.

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:33.790
Ed greets them off.

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.900
Later, they're driving in the rain and almost
hit a truck.

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.569
It's a close call but they're fine.

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:43.319
Suddenly, a tree hits the car and kills Mona,
then William drives off a cliff and into the

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:44.319
water.

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:47.069
He regains consciousness and checks if anyone
is alive.

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:50.250
No one, apart from him, has survived the crash.

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.190
William doesn't call an ambulance, but instead
he called Ed.

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.410
He's brought their equipment there and follows
William to the bodies.

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.890
William asks him to help him, but Ed thinks
that they should call the police.

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.020
Eventually, Ed changes his mind and helps
William transfer the minds of his family into

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:05.030
the equipment.

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.409
They get to the facility and Ed tells him
that there is a reason why he hasn't made

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:11.319
human clones yet, because they never turn
out right.

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:15.630
He asks William if he's prepared to terminate
the process if something goes wrong.

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.519
William doesn't give a straight answer, he
just wants to do it.

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:22.099
Ed shows him the pods in which he could replicate
the bodies, but he's worried that William

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:25.269
still hasn't perfected the process of transferring
the mind.

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:28.870
They get to the bodies and William pleads
with Ed not to share what has happened to

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.890
anyone, furthermore, he asks him to get rid
of the bodies.

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.750
He agrees and tells him that he'll meet him
back at the house.

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.709
When Ed arrives there, he opens the truck
and William sees that there are only 3 pods

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:39.969
to make the bodies.

00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:43.370
He can't choose which member of his family
to resurrect so he writes their names on a

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.530
piece of paper and asks Ed to pick.

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.049
He refuses to do that as well and William
needs to choose himself.

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:51.400
The paper he's taken out of the bowl is Zoey.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.390
Later, Ed explains to him how he should take
care of the pods and how to maintain the chemical

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.620
balance inside, but the most important thing
is to maintain the energy in the pods.

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.670
They must never go out of power.

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.830
William however doesn't have a backup generator,
so he finds a lot of car batteries and attaches

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:07.159
them to the pods.

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:10.610
Ed tells him the clones will need 17 days
to come out and he has until then to give

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:11.769
them consciousness.

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:14.040
He asks him what will happen to Zoey.

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.519
William says that he'll delete her memory
from their drives and they'll never remember

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:18.519
her.

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.400
Later, he's seen deleting the memory of Zoey
from the minds of the others.

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.280
But, the hard drive with her consciousness
is still active.

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:29.060
A few days later, Ed is at work and runs into
Jones, who asks him about William not showing

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:30.139
up for work.

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:33.990
He lies about why he's not there, then Jones
tells him to inform him that if they don't

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:37.660
see progress with the synthetic soon, they
will get shut down.

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.530
Ed calls William to tell him that, saying
that if they get shut down, the company will

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:44.900
look for the expensive equipment that is now
in his possession.

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.960
William tells him that he needs to come to
the house and watch the pods so he can go

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:48.970
to work.

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:52.700
As soon as he settles at work Jones pays him
a visit and doesn't seem too concerned that

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:53.930
he might be sick.

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:57.660
On his desk he sees Zoey's drawing and when
he goes back home he has it with him.

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:00.840
As he's walking to his front door he runs
into Matt's teacher who has come to check

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.780
up on him because he hasn't been to school
in five days.

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:07.380
Ed has handled that situation by telling her
that the boy has chicken pox.

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.970
Then he asks William why he hasn't called
the kids school and Mona's work to tell them

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:15.120
something, as if he was expecting that no
one would notice his entire family disappear.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.230
Later, he takes out all of their laptops and
phones.

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:22.340
He uses them to email the kids school and
also to text with his childrenâ€™s friends,

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:24.110
making it look like they're still alive.

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:28.130
Meanwhile, Margaret is overseeing the reparations
on the robot body.

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:31.970
William is working from home, trying to find
a way to transfer the mind from one body to

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:32.970
another.

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:36.289
He runs an unsuccessful simulation and is
beginning to lose hope.

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:38.010
The clones are almost ready.

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:41.850
Ed keeps covering him at work and he keeps
running one simulation after another.

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:46.789
17 days since the accident, Ed comes to William's
house to get the clones out of the pods.

00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:50.160
William tells him that he's not ready yet
because he doesn't know why the last experiment

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:51.160
failed.

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:54.780
Ed explains that every moment they stay in
the pods they continue to age so waiting for

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:57.009
him to figure it out isn't an option.

00:05:57.009 --> 00:06:00.120
William decides to sedate them so he could
keep their minds in a blank state.

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:04.410
Ed tells him that he can only keep them sedated
for 72 hours and no more.

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:08.180
They start draining his wife's pod and she
starts breathing by herself.

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:09.729
William sedates her instantly.

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:11.840
Ed is excited that their experiment worked.

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:15.710
Later, they set up IV's for the clones and
Ed leaves, saying he'll come back tomorrow

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:17.230
to check up on them.

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:20.569
William continues to go through the footage
of the previous experiment and still has no

00:06:20.569 --> 00:06:22.220
clue why it failed.

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:26.210
That night, he's ready to terminate his wife,
when he gets a call from Jones.

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:30.030
As he's talking to him he notices that each
time he touches Mona's clone, her heartbeat

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:31.169
goes up.

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:34.889
When Ed arrives to the house, William tells
him that he's figured it all out.

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:37.349
He takes him up to Mona and shows him what
he's found out.

00:06:37.349 --> 00:06:41.160
Then he explains that the reason why the brain
transfer doesn't work is because it's not

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:42.530
in its own body.

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:45.700
When they put it in a synthetic brain the
mind freaks out when it can't find its own

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:46.700
flesh.

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:50.180
The solution to the problem of transferring
the mind into a synthetic one is to trick

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:52.410
it into thinking that it's in its own body.

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:56.140
And it should be even simpler with his family
because the bodies are their clones.

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:59.660
They get ready to initiate the process of
transferring Mona's mind into the body of

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:00.860
the clone.

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:04.409
William coordinates the uploading process,
then initiates the imprint.

00:07:04.409 --> 00:07:08.190
When it's done, Ed freaks out that nothing
is happening, when she suddenly begins to

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:09.190
convulse.

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:12.990
She wakes up and recognizes him, so he puts
her back to sleep until he does the same with

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:15.110
the kids and prepares the house for them.

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:18.790
At the end of the day, after all of it is
done, Ed leaves and tells him that they'll

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:20.669
see each other at work.

00:07:20.669 --> 00:07:23.740
William gets back to the house and begins
to clean it up and get rid of the evidence

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:25.159
of everything that happened.

00:07:25.159 --> 00:07:29.710
Lastly, he needs to get rid of all of Zoe's
things and make it look like she never existed.

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:32.460
He packs all of her things and throws them
away.

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:35.659
Later that night, he lies down in bed next
to his wife.

00:07:35.659 --> 00:07:38.159
William wakes up the next day and finds Mona
gone.

00:07:38.159 --> 00:07:42.449
When he rushes downstairs he sees them all
having breakfast like nothing has ever happened.

00:07:42.449 --> 00:07:45.460
Mona says that she feels great and goes out
for a run.

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:48.159
The kids ask for pancakes and he makes some
for them.

00:07:48.159 --> 00:07:51.360
Mona is jogging when she suddenly gest an
ache in her abdomen.

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:55.310
When she gets back, Sophie pours milk in a
cup and they see that it's curdled.

00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:57.940
Mona says that she just got it the other day.

00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:01.479
William gets a call from Ed, telling him that
they have an incoming donor at work and that

00:08:01.479 --> 00:08:04.190
if he doesn't want their secret exposed he
should be there.

00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:07.580
He tells the clone family that he has to leave
for work and they don't see anything wrong

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:10.849
about that, but Mona does find his behavior
strange.

00:08:10.849 --> 00:08:12.090
William gets to work.

00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:16.000
Him and Ed are preparing the donor for the
transfer, but he deems him non-viable because

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.590
he doesn't want to make another one go through
the phase of rejection again and the suffering

00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:21.080
that it might bring.

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:24.400
Jones is breathing down their necks and Ed
is upset that they didn't do it.

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:28.520
William gets the idea to transfer his own
mind into the synthetic brain, so he takes

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:32.829
the transfer equipment to the toilet and performs
the transference protocol on himself.

00:08:32.829 --> 00:08:37.010
Meanwhile, Sophie and Mona look for their
cell phones and they can't find them anywhere.

00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:38.450
Mona feels strange.

00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:41.810
Back at the facility, William finds Ed and
tells him what he did.

00:08:41.810 --> 00:08:45.029
He explains that he will write an algorithm
which will help bridge his imprint to the

00:08:45.029 --> 00:08:49.180
artificial body, effectively tricking the
synthetic brain that the body is his.

00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:52.950
The added benefit of it being him inside that
body will be that he will be able to establish

00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:56.339
himself as the baseline for the transferred
consciousness.

00:08:56.339 --> 00:08:59.950
William gets back home that night and finds
Mona upset, immediately telling him that she

00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:02.030
feels like something is wrong with her.

00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:05.390
She can't remember a lot of things that happened
during the past few weeks.

00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:07.760
He comforts her and tells her that she should
rest.

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:10.269
He goes to the basement and writes the algorithm.

00:09:10.269 --> 00:09:12.930
The drive with his consciousness is sat next
to Zoey's.

00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:17.279
Later, Sophie has a nightmare about her mom
dying and calls for her, but William comes

00:09:17.279 --> 00:09:20.080
in her room and tells her that she just had
a bad dream.

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:23.790
He takes her back to the basement and overwrites
her memory so that it excludes the memory

00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:24.990
of them dying.

00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:27.750
Mona catches him there and asks what he's
done to Sophie.

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:29.519
She wants to know the truth.

00:09:29.519 --> 00:09:31.870
William tells her that he brought them back
from the dead.

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:35.200
They have a conversation later on and she
asks him how he could do that.

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:38.390
He tells her that he couldn't bear loosing
them and that he had to do it.

00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:39.550
She understands.

00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:42.380
The next day, the family meets with Ed at
the market.

00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:45.390
Mona thinks she sees something and almost
remembers Zoey.

00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:49.410
They have dinner together that night and William
asks them if they should move back home.

00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:53.720
Sophie asks who Zoey is, telling him that
the name is scribbled in her closet with a

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:54.720
crayon.

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:57.410
The three of them begin remembering little
bits about her and Mona confronts William

00:09:57.410 --> 00:09:58.410
about it.

00:09:58.410 --> 00:10:01.310
He tries to lie to her, but she sees right
through him.

00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:03.670
Suddenly, the doorbell rings.

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:07.540
William opens the door for Jones who greets
Mona and asks for a quick word with him.

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:11.200
He tells him that he knows everything about
what he has done and calls his family subjects

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:13.550
of the trial in possession of the company.

00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:17.440
Jones isn't ready to have them walking around
like everything is normal, fearing the consequences

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:19.260
if someone finds out about them.

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:22.600
William tries to negotiate with him by telling
him that he knows how to get the synthetic

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:24.000
brain to work.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.060
Unfortunately, Jones isn't after that.

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:29.850
He explains that the company isn't even a
bio-medical one, but is actually part of the

00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:31.370
weapons industry.

00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:33.340
Jones has another plan for his findings.

00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:36.770
He tells him to give him the algorithm then
say goodbye to his family.

00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:40.410
William goes to get the algorithm and Jones
texts two assassins to get ready.

00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:44.490
When he gets back, he tries to drug Jones,
but just ends up knocking him out.

00:10:44.490 --> 00:10:48.530
He destroys the algorithm and explains everything
about Zoey to Mona and about the company that

00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:49.890
he works for.

00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:51.760
William tells her that they need to run.

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:55.720
They get into the car and escape before the
assassins realize what is happening.

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:59.980
Jones wakes up and sees the destroyed algorithm,
realizing that it's unsalvageable.

00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:03.180
One of his men comes in and shows him the
tracker they have on the family.

00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:05.500
He tells him not to shoot them in the head.

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:09.449
Simultaneously, a car starts chasing the family,
ramming into them.

00:11:09.449 --> 00:11:11.550
They quickly manage to escape.

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:15.540
William tells Mona that the trackers are inside
of them, attached to the central nervous system

00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:17.300
and that they can't get them out.

00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:21.580
Mona has another idea about that and tells
him to drive to the clinic where she works.

00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:25.170
When they arrive, Mona gets them in a room
and tells Sophie to get on the bed as she

00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:26.880
prepares a defibrillator.

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:29.339
She explains that she can fry the trackers
that way.

00:11:29.339 --> 00:11:33.589
Meanwhile, the assassins arrive at the hospital
and see that one tracker goes dark.

00:11:33.589 --> 00:11:37.150
Mona places the defibrillator on Matt's chest
next and shocks him.

00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:41.360
The assassins kill the security guard, as
William is getting ready to shock Mona.

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:44.230
Her tracker disappears and the assassins don't
find them.

00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:46.290
The family escapes the hospital.

00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:47.760
Jones calls someone.

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:51.310
William has driven them to the marina and
goes to check if he can get to Ed's boat.

00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:55.079
While he looks for the keys, the assassins
arrive at the marina and grab the kids and

00:11:55.079 --> 00:11:56.079
Mona.

00:11:56.079 --> 00:11:59.110
He sees them being taken away but doesn't
get to them in time.

00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:02.980
Ed is at the office and Jones hands him back
his boat keys as Mona and the kids are being

00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:04.280
taken inside.

00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:08.630
He tells Mona that William just needs to cooperate
and that everything will be alright.

00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:10.480
She says that they'll just kill them.

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:12.840
Meanwhile, William arrives at the facility.

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:16.590
Ed explains how everything with Jones went
down, telling her that he was in on it from

00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:18.029
the very beginning.

00:12:18.029 --> 00:12:20.540
William walks in and Ed apologizes to him.

00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:24.930
Then he tries to negotiate with Jones, who
kills Ed to make his threats more powerful.

00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:28.649
William recreates the algorithm for Jones
and begins the imprinting process inside of

00:12:28.649 --> 00:12:30.000
the synthetic brain.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.600
He energizes the body without anyone's knowledge.

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:35.300
It begins to move and breaks through it's
restraints.

00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:37.870
William goes back to Jones and gives him the
algorithm.

00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:41.990
Just as Jones is getting ready to kill Mona,
the robot walks inside, saying that he's there

00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:43.490
to protect his family.

00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:46.770
The assassins shoot at him, but it tears through
them like butter.

00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:50.360
The family gets in the car and is prepared
to leave, but William can't just leave the

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:51.730
robot behind.

00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:53.290
Mona tells him to go.

00:12:53.290 --> 00:12:56.110
He stops it from killing Jones right at the
nick of time.

00:12:56.110 --> 00:13:00.230
The two of them converse and the robot says
that the body feels like it's his own.

00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:04.200
Jones tells him that even if they kill him,
the company will still go after them.

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:07.260
William and the robot offer Jones a deal that
he can't refuse.

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:10.460
The robot tells him that he should go with
the family and that it should stay back and

00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:11.760
deal with Jones.

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:13.970
It makes an imprint out of Jones's mind.

00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:17.410
17 days later, a clone is ready to get out
of it's pod.

00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:21.050
The family is having a vacation on a beach
and William brings Zoey to them.

00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:22.870
Mona embraces her fondly.

00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:27.360
Some time later, Jones is in Dubai selling
William's invention to a rich old man.

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:33.730
The robot is the one that does the work for
Jones.
