00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.160
What happens when you are buried alive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.320
well? We will find out in this video i have&nbsp;
researched a little and found some interesting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:17.120
stuff let's see how we can align that with our&nbsp;
character Paul and see how we get out of there.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.640
Paul wakes up in a confined and dark space he can&nbsp;
barely move his hands are tied and he is gagged up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.120
this tells us that he was buried purposely and&nbsp;
probably by someone that doesn't like him very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:36.160
much we can also assume that he wasn't buried&nbsp;
too long ago neither that is important to know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:42.960
as we will come to see you see the space in a&nbsp;
modern day coffin encapsulates around 886 liters&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.800
if we subtract the average space of a human body&nbsp;
we will get roughly 820 liters of air supply&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:54.240
this would give us approximately 5 hours of air&nbsp;
but if we were unconscious for god knows how long&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.960
we have no idea how long we've been already&nbsp;
breathing that limited air so we gotta keep this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.720
in mind our character starts out well he tries&nbsp;
to orient himself and finds a zippo in his pocket&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.680
and is able to visually analyze the space he&nbsp;
sits in that's a wonderful advantage with this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.080
he is able to cut through the fabric tying up&nbsp;
his hands with one of the screws peeking out of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.360
the wood the first big challenge you will face&nbsp;
is calming yourself down an untrained mind will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.800
keep on distracting you it will be busy trying to&nbsp;
convince you that you are as good as dead these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:30.560
thoughts will invite fear in fact they will invite&nbsp;
the most intense fear you've ever experienced you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.440
will start to breathe heavily and quickly using&nbsp;
much more oxygen than necessary which ironically&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.800
leads you to an even sooner death so staying calm&nbsp;
is of importance here not only will it literally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.680
double your lifespan but it will also allow you&nbsp;
to think more clearly and yes it does matter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.480
i've said it many times in previous videos but&nbsp;
mindfulness meditation in this situation is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:55.760
invaluable especially when we are talking about&nbsp;
your last moments of life but in this video we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:01.040
don't try to die in peace we try to escape and&nbsp;
get the hell out of there so air supply will be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:07.840
enough for a few hours we have light and by now&nbsp;
we have already freed our hands and what is this

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:19.440
god bless the lord that's sort of like finding&nbsp;
your future wife on tinder chances are very low&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.560
boom you got a phone what now check the connection&nbsp;
of course but we must consider we are buried&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.680
around three to six feet deep right that means&nbsp;
connection could exist but it doesn't necessarily&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:35.200
have to and if it does it's probably pretty&nbsp;
unstable in our case here paul has connection&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.240
and is able to dial back home we furthermore&nbsp;
find out that he is an arabic speaking country&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:46.400
namely iraq that doesn't really help the situation&nbsp;
but i guess it is what it is he has not calmed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.920
himself down yet and is increasingly agitated&nbsp;
that's a lethal mistake not only is he consuming&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:57.520
oxygen like a horny bull but he also won't be able&nbsp;
to convince anyone he calls if he were collected&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.880
and calm he could explain thoroughly and gain the&nbsp;
officer's trust officers are usually trained to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:08.400
determine whether a phone call is real or fake&nbsp;
and by all means it is impossible for you to not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.680
sound honest in this situation walk them through&nbsp;
let them know the state of the phone's battery&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:19.360
back for help in a calm manner back in 2010&nbsp;
there were still many us troops stationed in iraq&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:24.480
that's a benefit your phone can easily be located&nbsp;
through the nearest tower with which your phone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.360
is connected and considering the three battery&nbsp;
bars on this vintage phone we can assume that we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:35.120
have hours left using this device so hang tight&nbsp;
this could be your way out but you gotta manage&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:40.400
your emotions now tracing back a phone is quite&nbsp;
simple the fbi or whoever you're talking to would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.480
contact your mobile carrier which then traces&nbsp;
back your phone by analyzing the signals coming&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.560
from your phone usually your phone transmits&nbsp;
data to the nearest cell phone tower through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.120
this tower they can determine your approximate&nbsp;
location as you can imagine however using only&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:58.400
one tower is pretty inaccurate and that is where&nbsp;
cell phone triangulation comes into play basically&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.960
the method of using multiple towers around you to&nbsp;
calculate your position more accurately to do that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:06.960
they measure the time it takes for your phone&nbsp;
to receive signals that were sent from multiple&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:11.600
towers around you obviously it takes longer for&nbsp;
your phone to receive signals from more distant&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:16.640
towers and thus it is possible to figure out your&nbsp;
position by calculating the time the signals take&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:21.840
to arrive at your phone this doesn't take long&nbsp;
but considering that you are in iraq the fbi&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.880
would need to contact the local u.s embassy which&nbsp;
then again connects to a local high official who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:32.240
then initiates the action on your carrier's side&nbsp;
the united states seem pretty efficient in things&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.760
like this i can imagine troops actively looking&nbsp;
for you within 2 hours even if we assume that it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:43.040
would take 3 hours your available oxygen will&nbsp;
probably suffice that is if you stop breathing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:49.360
like a freak it's just too bad paul can't chill i&nbsp;
mean i get why you would freak out but then again&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:55.120
how about freaking out first and then place a&nbsp;
call paul failed convincing the fbi however that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:00.080
is possible i don't know but he found another&nbsp;
number on his phone which by the way isn't his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:05.840
when he calls a rough voice with a strong accent&nbsp;
replies he tells paul he would let him out if his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:12.080
embassy made a transaction of 5 million usd by 9&nbsp;
pm today in a scene before we could see that it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:17.840
is currently just past 6 p.m this is a chance to&nbsp;
negotiate if i were paul i would convincingly tell&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:22.640
my kidnapper that i had a close friend working&nbsp;
at the embassy and that 5 million dollars would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:27.760
not be a problem out of experience i would say the&nbsp;
embassy will only send the money if they received&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:33.600
reassurance of my well-being the obvious goal is&nbsp;
to get out of this box first i would explain that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:39.200
if i died in here he would not receive any money&nbsp;
for sure so it's a definitive loss but if he let&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:43.760
me out showed the embassy that i'm still alive&nbsp;
he would certainly have the chance to receive the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:49.040
money it's a potential win to strengthen my point&nbsp;
i would add that if he didn't receive any money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:54.720
by 9 pm he could shoot me if he agreed i would&nbsp;
tell him that i will contact the embassy and dial&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.720 --> 00:06:00.960
him back in a moment afterwards i would call the&nbsp;
fbi let me be connected to the local u.s embassy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:05.360
explain the situation and try to be located&nbsp;
through the triangulation method i have explained&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:11.120
before 9 pm leaves us around 2 hours and 30&nbsp;
minutes for anyone to intervene and free us&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:16.160
paul hasn't done any of that of course but there&nbsp;
are multiple interesting things that happen next&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:22.320
let me make clear that by now paul has called the&nbsp;
fbi a us-based police department plus a friend&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:28.640
of his and he has failed all three times that is&nbsp;
incredible at this point i just want to continue&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:33.440
enjoy watching him insulting people while slowly&nbsp;
wasting his oxygen i didn't know you could make&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:38.160
an entertaining movie with just one handsome&nbsp;
dude being stuck in a dark box with a sipple&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:44.560
and a cell phone using incredible profanity that&nbsp;
i unfortunately have to cut out well this movie is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:49.920
pretty darn good and by looking at the next scene&nbsp;
it seems like paul didn't fail completely "Paul&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:54.240
i was informed of what's going on i want you to&nbsp;
know that we're already working on trying to get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:59.200
you out of there" - that's a ray of hope this&nbsp;
would boost my confidence what i would do next&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:04.320
if i haven't already done that would be to do&nbsp;
anything to assist my operator then our operator&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:10.160
tells paul for example to turn off vibration mode&nbsp;
to conserve battery life at the same time he tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:14.800
him to give him his kidnapper's phone number so&nbsp;
they can locate him instead apparently locating&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:19.600
our phone is a bit tricky because it goes over&nbsp;
a carrier in egypt but if they can't find the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:24.480
kidnapper they will most likely be able to find&nbsp;
us too right but just when i thought things would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:31.280
change paul finds a bag underneath his legs at&nbsp;
this point i was just um i was a bit confused why&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:37.840
didn't he find this bag a bit earlier i mean this&nbsp;
is not a big space um this is uh confusing paul&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:42.800
because if you find yourself in an unknown place&nbsp;
the first thing you should always do is get to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:48.880
know the environment in this bag he finds a lamp&nbsp;
a glowing stick and a knife you really would have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:53.680
wanted to find it early on right although things&nbsp;
would boost my confidence it's just reassuring to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:58.720
not have to worry about light i mean burning&nbsp;
up your zippo for light uses a lot of oxygen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:04.400
and you don't really have much pole another insane&nbsp;
thing that paul hasn't paid any attention to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:09.760
is the bottle of anti-anxiety pills that were in&nbsp;
his pockets too he had them since the beginning&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:14.880
yet for some reason didn't use any of them with&nbsp;
these pills he could have drastically slowed down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:20.560
his breathing starting an hour ago and let's not&nbsp;
talk about the anti-anxiety effect of anti-anxiety&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:25.600
pills if he popped a couple he would have never&nbsp;
shouted at the fbi operator at the beginning&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:31.280
he could have easily arrived at the point where he&nbsp;
is now over 45 minutes ago but anyway let's talk&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:36.080
about something fun for a second okay would it&nbsp;
be possible to actually break through the casket&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:41.040
and free ourselves there are a few interesting&nbsp;
points i have found at this point we have a knife&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:46.560
right the casket as we have seen so far is only a&nbsp;
cheap provisional wooden box made out of cheap and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:52.640
dry wooden bars we should be able to break through&nbsp;
it the question is how would the soil react i mean&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:57.920
since we got beverages recently we can assume&nbsp;
that the soil covering us is pretty loose that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:02.800
is good and bad at the same time good in so far&nbsp;
that it would make it easier to dig through as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:08.000
opposed to wet and heavy soil but the bad thing&nbsp;
is it would enter our casket at a tremendous&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:14.080
speed so can we get out of here let's have a look&nbsp;
in an older episode of mythbusters the team tried&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:19.520
to escape being buried alive they were able to&nbsp;
escape being buried under two feet of dirt we can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:24.560
assume that paul with a bit of luck would also be&nbsp;
able to escape if he was also only covered by two&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:30.160
feet of dirt which is a possibility i think the&nbsp;
intriguing part about this clip is how the dirt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:35.600
enters the coffin we can see that the surface only&nbsp;
collapses on the side where the hole has been made&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:40.880
that's an advantage that we should exploit as well&nbsp;
i would try to make a decent hole just below my&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:46.400
chin i will try to control the dirt entering as&nbsp;
much as i can and then push all the dirt down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:52.000
to my feet what i'm trying to do here is let as&nbsp;
much dirt into the casket as possible so that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.880
there is less above me the best case would be&nbsp;
to establish a tunnel reaching up to the surface&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:02.320
just as we have seen in the mythbuster episode&nbsp;
however even if we can't establish a tunnel we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:07.360
are able to take away quite a bit of dirt above&nbsp;
us with this method remember how i said in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:13.440
beginning that our coffin holds around 800 liters&nbsp;
if we are talking about filling up just 25% of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:19.280
casket with pure dirt we can literally reshift&nbsp;
200 liters of dirt above us and that's quite an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:24.560
advantage this would take time but it's not like&nbsp;
we have anything better to do right so the goal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:29.760
is to eventually widen the hole so much that we&nbsp;
can almost sit up with our heads peeking through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:34.560
this has to be done quickly and with a lot&nbsp;
of force as dirt will keep on raining on us&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:39.920
therefore i would take off my shirt put it over my&nbsp;
head and thus create an air tissue between my face&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:45.200
and the pouring dirt then i would wiggle around&nbsp;
like a worm push myself up with my hands and try&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:51.040
to get up to the surface as quick and controlled&nbsp;
as possible i think if buried with only two to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:56.160
maybe three feet of dirt this might actually&nbsp;
work if it is more than that i'm afraid there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:56.160 --> 00:11:02.240
is probably no way to escape so perhaps you use&nbsp;
your lighter or your knife for a different purpose&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:07.680
in a later scene however we can even see a snake&nbsp;
entering paul's temporary home i first thought he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:13.120
was hallucinating but i guess this was real&nbsp;
if anyone knows what type of snake this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:17.840
please let me know in the comments i wonder if&nbsp;
she's poisonous as well and if so what are the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:22.560
symptoms of being bitten i assume it's probably&nbsp;
as shitty as suffocating in a pool of dirt but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:28.000
you let me know however a snake entering&nbsp;
from the side of our casket implies that we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:33.040
can't be too deep underneath the ground right up&nbsp;
on my research i haven't really found evidence&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:38.480
for snakes burying themselves deeply either this&nbsp;
one is special in which case you can and probably&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:43.680
will let me know in the comments section or we&nbsp;
aren't buried as deep as we think we are now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:49.200
after successfully alienating the snake paul goes&nbsp;
back and forth calling his kidnapper the rescue&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:55.040
operator dan and his friends back home his time is&nbsp;
running out and he has not yet made a big attempt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:55.040 --> 00:12:00.960
to get out of there apart from dialing out for&nbsp;
help now granted okay external help was and still&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:06.080
is the biggest chance to survive here however&nbsp;
there is a time when you gotta make a decision&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:11.040
so if i were paul here i would have conserved&nbsp;
my phone battery and only connected with dan my&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:16.320
operator i would have taken my anti-anxiety pills&nbsp;
to slow down my breathing and engaged in mindful&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:21.680
meditation as much as possible i would have given&nbsp;
the phone number of my kidnapper to then as well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:26.800
something paul has only done way too late into&nbsp;
the movie i still think being located and rescued&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:31.120
is the best option to survive this situation&nbsp;
another awkward thing was that at one point&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:36.160
paul's environment was bombarded by an airstrike&nbsp;
his coffin got completely shaken through through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:40.560
the damage several holes have been created&nbsp;
inside this coffin and this resulted in lots&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:46.080
of sand pouring in rapidly this also suggests that&nbsp;
he wasn't buried all too deep paul here even heard&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:50.800
a prayer of a mosque just prior to the impact&nbsp;
and being buried underneath layers upon layers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:56.320
of dirt i don't think you're able to hear anything&nbsp;
apart from your own heartbeat and fading breath&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:56.320 --> 00:13:01.680
the point that i'm trying to make here is that the&nbsp;
snake the damage caused by the impact as well as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:07.200
being able to hear voices all suggested we were&nbsp;
not buried all too deep and that an escape was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:12.320
possible but even if we assumed that we were able&nbsp;
to escape this coffin it seems like the kidnappers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:17.600
were waiting above all along meaning we would have&nbsp;
been taken out as soon as we got there at least&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:23.600
most likely but if i had to choose between slowly&nbsp;
suffocating in a dark box drowning in dirt or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:29.120
being just shot dead above ground i would pick the&nbsp;
latter any time you see watching this movie and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:34.400
thinking about ways to escape left me to conclude&nbsp;
that he could have escaped by himself i think he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:39.280
legit had the chance to escape with the method&nbsp;
i have shared before especially having tools at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:44.720
hand like a knife and the light source what would&nbsp;
happen if he made it up above remains in question&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:49.520
but considering that not escaping the coffin would&nbsp;
end in a sure death making a move would have been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:54.400
preferable even though he tragically died in&nbsp;
the end he could and perhaps should have at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:59.920
least attempted to get out of there i know this&nbsp;
is easier said than done so what do you think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:05.680
is there a chance to survive did he make a stupid&nbsp;
mistake and how would you proceed if you suddenly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:11.120
woke up tomorrow morning being buried alive&nbsp;
let me know in the comments and as always&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:20.880
i am so grateful that you made it this far thanks&nbsp;
for being here and i catch you in the next one
