00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.360
in this video we will review each trap highlight&nbsp;
its mechanism and figure out how to survive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:08.240
and ultimately beat all the traps in saw six

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.000
the movie doesn't play around much&nbsp;
and starts right with the first trap&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.280
two victims Eddie and Simone are about to get&nbsp;
their skulls pierced with large machine screws&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:24.000
now for your information machine screws are&nbsp;
particularly wide in diameter and therefore&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.880
much more painful when piercing through a skull&nbsp;
in fact they would not simply just pierce the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.560
skull but much more violently break through it.
In order to survive our two characters have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.880
to slice off body parts and put them&nbsp;
on a wage they have one minute time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.200
after the minute runs out the character&nbsp;
with the least weight on the wage will get

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.160
a migraine

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.400
now the first important note here is the timer&nbsp;
starts only when both victims pull the trigger&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:55.360
by standing up or bowing forward too much&nbsp;
Simone is the first character to wake up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.920
and releases the machine however both need&nbsp;
to release the mechanism in order to start&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:05.920
the game she tries to convince her counterpart&nbsp;
not to move "don't lean forward" - next time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.080
try screaming louder perhaps tell him&nbsp;
right off the bat that if he moves he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.600
will die i promise you this will probably&nbsp;
do it the best chance here for survival is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.960
clearly not to start the game by too much movement&nbsp;
if you delay the activation of the trap you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.080
technically have infinite time available to fiddle&nbsp;
around with the headgear and find a way out of it&nbsp;

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.440
the knives could be used as tools to release&nbsp;
components and loosen the trap up a bit in any&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:37.120
way having time here is of importance 60 seconds&nbsp;
is just not enough time to come up with rational&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:42.880
ideas now at first i was a little confused as&nbsp;
to why none of the characters would place other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:48.320
objects onto the wage other than sliced off belly&nbsp;
fat and arms but after looking at it a little&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.360
closer it wouldn't make a big difference perhaps&nbsp;
it would even cause you a potential disadvantage&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.400
basically there is no filter that prevents you&nbsp;
from putting anything you want onto the wage&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.600
that is true however by observing the room&nbsp;
we realize that there is pretty much nothing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.360
available to shove down the tube everything seems&nbsp;
to be fixed the knives for instance are chained&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.880
quite securely onto the table so the only objects&nbsp;
possible to put through the tube would be your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:21.440
clothes of which your shoes are probably the most&nbsp;
valuable item because of the related weight if you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.480
choose to go this way however you must consider&nbsp;
that your opponent has the exact same option&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.840
and if his clothes are heavier than yours you're&nbsp;
automatically pressured into cutting off precious&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.280
body parts therefore it is a risky solution&nbsp;
if you really want to take the risk though&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.600
you would do well to shove down those&nbsp;
things only in the last few seconds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:47.200
and pray that your opponent has less weight on&nbsp;
the wage than you in any way it is obvious that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.240
the best way to beat this trap is definitely&nbsp;
not to start the game in the first place&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:57.440
we can do this like mentioned before by avoiding&nbsp;
too much movement and appropriate communication

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:05.520
now the second trap tries to screw over Mr.&nbsp;
William Easton who was placed there because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:11.120
well like everyone else targeted by jigsaw&nbsp;
he's an a-hole the trap this time consists&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:16.880
of four tests he has to overcome now oddly&nbsp;
enough the first test also involves his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.040
office janitor now don't ask me&nbsp;
why this poor man is involved&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.600
as if being a janitor isn't enough hardship&nbsp;
already anyway they both are attached to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:31.840
a machine that crushes their torsos every&nbsp;
time to take a breath we can see that here

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.680
now this test is quite challenging to get out&nbsp;
of because being strapped on hands and feet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.920
is a nasty way to immobilize someone&nbsp;
unless this person has asked you to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.360
then i guess it can be sexy
you kinky bastards&nbsp;

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:52.160
well anyways unfortunately none of our&nbsp;
characters asked for sexy time and there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:57.760
is no other way to beat this trap than beating&nbsp;
your opponent meaning someone must and will die&nbsp;

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.760
however there are several things you&nbsp;
can do to stretch out your given time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:07.360
and thus gain an advantage over your opponent&nbsp;
the simplest way to do that is twist your torso&nbsp;

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:12.400
at the end just before Mr. Easton gets released&nbsp;
we can see that the strap is loose enough for some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.600
range of motion i assure you even just a small&nbsp;
twist will give you a significant advantage and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.800
time bonus because you minimize the pressure on&nbsp;
both sides in shifting the angle from where the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:28.160
machine is closing in while this strategy can&nbsp;
make a big difference it won't instantaneously&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:34.720
save your life for a sure victory you must control&nbsp;
your breath what i mean is the more and deeper&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:40.320
you breathe the faster you will get crushed so&nbsp;
naturally you want to avoid breathing as much as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:46.720
you can and so the single most important thing&nbsp;
here is stay calm because the higher your heart&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:52.080
rate the more oxygen your body requires and the&nbsp;
more you end up breathing there are two techniques&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:57.280
i would recommend either you take the deepest&nbsp;
breath possible before crushing your body and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:03.840
hold it most people are able to hold their breath&nbsp;
between 30 and 120 seconds if you don't smoke&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:09.280
which William doesn't you have a great chance of&nbsp;
winning against someone like the janitor who does&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.600
however that still seems to be a little&nbsp;
risky the other way and my personal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:19.360
favorite would be controlled hyperventilation
it might appear counterintuitive since that also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:24.880
increases your heart rate but you see controlled&nbsp;
hyperventilation is a tactic literally used by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:30.640
free divers to diffuse their system of carbon&nbsp;
dioxide if applied correctly one can increase&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:36.400
the time of holding one's breath immensely which&nbsp;
would be very beneficial in our situation here the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:43.280
average adult takes 8 to 16 breaths per minute&nbsp;
to hyperventilate you may double these numbers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:48.880
professor MacGiven from the Neumann university has&nbsp;
found out after having done a classroom experiment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:54.160
that after 30 seconds of hyperventilation the&nbsp;
average breath holding duration increased by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:59.920
24 seconds which goes without saying is an&nbsp;
incredible improvement however i must add&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:05.360
here that hyperventilation to hold one's breath&nbsp;
can be very dangerous and should not be performed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:11.360
when not being supervised especially underwater in&nbsp;
the case of Mr. Easton however we can assume that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:17.200
this technique is less risky in comparison to the&nbsp;
trap and therefore could be very helpful indeed

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:23.120
after surviving the first test Mr. Easton makes&nbsp;
his way up to the next one and on the way there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.640
we get some flashbacks and a quick&nbsp;
philosophy check by John Kramer -&nbsp;

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:30.720
"but you're not taking into consideration&nbsp;
the most important human element of all"

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:31.360
"which is what?"

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:33.120
"the will to live"

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:39.120
I kind of miss this guy even though he was a crazy&nbsp;
mother- he did have a solid charisma much other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:49.040
than detective Hoffman i i just i can't stand&nbsp;
this guy in his lips man they're weird now this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:55.120
indeed a very unfortunate trap that leaves almost&nbsp;
no chance to save both victims however the glass&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:55.120 --> 00:07:00.320
between the two victims and William is definitely&nbsp;
breakable the only question then remaining&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:04.880
how would you save those too "Wingardium Leviosa"
I don't think so&nbsp;

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:08.320
It seems like the only way possible&nbsp;
here is to break the glass,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:14.080
climb into the trap and release both manually this&nbsp;
would only be possible by not activating the trap&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:19.680
which in any case is unlikely however this&nbsp;
would be the ideal solution here if you were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:25.360
to activate the trap though and choose one of&nbsp;
the victims to die then the following happens&nbsp;

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:30.160
the victim close to death gets his hands&nbsp;
released and after around 10 seconds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:35.200
gets pulled up the time window of 10 seconds&nbsp;
would allow you to break the glass, get into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:40.320
the trap and push up the hanging person but you&nbsp;
wouldn't be able to prevent him getting pulled up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:46.160
on his neck even if the victim pulls himself up on&nbsp;
the metal wire with his freed hands it is unlikely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:50.960
he would be able to stay like this for extended&nbsp;
periods of time if you've ever pulled yourself up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:56.560
on a rope you know how tiring it is and in this&nbsp;
situation i imagine the stamina is pretty low&nbsp;

00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:00.640
William also doesn't seem to have any&nbsp;
tools available to rescue that person&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:04.800
he would at least need a ladder or&nbsp;
something similar for a successful rescue&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:09.440
therefore he would have done well inspecting&nbsp;
the trap first before pulling the triggers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:13.920
and conclude not to activate it&nbsp;
all together still no easy feat but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:18.320
nonetheless possible since sound can travel&nbsp;
through the glass window and therefore it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:26.080
would have been possible to realize what&nbsp;
this trap is about without activating it

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:32.400
on to the next one trap four i want to&nbsp;
talk first and foremost about this yes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:36.240
there is no doubt that direct sunlight is&nbsp;
shining through the metal grid in front&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:40.160
of it looks very unstable and with&nbsp;
the tools available in this chamber&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:45.920
it is very likely that one can escape from here
but the big problem really here are the detonators&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:51.840
attached on both wrists of William meaning you&nbsp;
must play the games until the very end unless&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:57.280
you find a way to get them off but then again&nbsp;
fiddling with them may cause them to explode&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:02.480
i wouldn't recommend it however in this&nbsp;
test Mr. Easton was supposed to guide Debbie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:07.920
his former lawyer through the maze from above he&nbsp;
was supposed to assist her with re-channeling this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:13.120
steam by activating the switching devices the&nbsp;
catch here is that the hot steam is aimed at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:18.400
himself every time he activates a switch which&nbsp;
goes without saying is very painful however if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:22.800
you have watched my last videos you will know&nbsp;
that i'm a big fan of using clothes as tools&nbsp;

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:28.880
the first switch he could have easily pushed&nbsp;
over with his shoes the heel side to be precise&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:33.920
as it's the least elastic part of the shoe&nbsp;
and therefore most useful for such tasks&nbsp;

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:38.800
or if you're the boring type reach over with&nbsp;
your leg push it over with you know your feet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:45.760
and there you go can be done like this too but i'm&nbsp;
not a fan of it the second switch was yeah well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:52.320
shakes my head in disbelief this guy literally&nbsp;
stretched himself over the railing like a crane&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:58.240
to activate the switch and caused a huge upward&nbsp;
stream of boiling hot air to blow right into his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:04.000
face definitely unpleasant but really you don't&nbsp;
need to bend over the railing here there was by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.120
far enough space underneath to grab the switch&nbsp;
here which would have caused the stream of hot air&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:14.160
to blow over your head instead but anyway Debbie&nbsp;
eventually makes it through the maze and finds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:20.240
a circular saw at the end of the maze the key to&nbsp;
release a trap strapped onto her chest lies deep&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:26.720
in Mr. Easton's body she attempts to kill him but&nbsp;
fails miserably i found it a seriously dumb move&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:32.240
because the trap that was about to kill her&nbsp;
was only strapped onto her with leather belts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:35.280
meaning they could have easily been&nbsp;
cut through with the circular saw

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:42.320
in this trap six of Williams subordinates&nbsp;
are chained to a spinning carousel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:47.120
the carousel stops randomly while the mounted&nbsp;
shotgun is pointing at it the shotgun is loaded&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:53.280
with six rounds and would therefore kill each one&nbsp;
of them however William would be able to save two&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:59.360
of them by pushing down two buttons at the same&nbsp;
time by using the machinery next spy the catch&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:04.640
well every time he pushes down the buttons&nbsp;
a metal bolt would pierce his hand i mean at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:09.680
this point i was convinced that the scriptwriter&nbsp;
must have graduated in mechanical engineering&nbsp;

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:12.720
there are two main questions&nbsp;
i would like to answer here&nbsp;

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:18.400
first how William could have saved two people&nbsp;
without the need of going through this nasty pain&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:22.400
and secondly how there is potential&nbsp;
to save more than just two people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:26.880
in this picture we see that the opening of&nbsp;
the machinery can fit two hands allowing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:32.640
you to push down two buttons at the same time&nbsp;
without the need of piercing your own hand easy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:38.720
the tricky part here is to save everyone first&nbsp;
and foremost the time is the main problem here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:44.560
there are about 40 seconds between each triggered&nbsp;
shot with the method of before William can save&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:50.480
two people giving a window of roughly 120&nbsp;
seconds before the first person gets killed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:57.840
if my math is correct then that would mean 120&nbsp;
seconds to save everyone 160 seconds to save five&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:05.040
200 for four survivors and 240 seconds for three&nbsp;
while 120 seconds is probably too confident here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:10.320
i think 240 could be enough to save at least three&nbsp;
of the victims how would i do it let me explain&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:16.160
around the carousel are ceiling high metal bars&nbsp;
which deny access however attached to the bars&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:22.880
behind the shotgun there is a 4 square meter or 43&nbsp;
square feet metal grit protecting the shotgun of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:29.600
possible manipulation meaning jigsaw knew that the&nbsp;
distance between each bar is wide enough to allow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:34.400
someone to reach through giving the potential&nbsp;
to fiddle around with the mounted gun could that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:39.680
mean he was scared that the device would not&nbsp;
withhold strong interference pulls and pushes&nbsp;

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:45.440
possibly that means if you can quickly tie&nbsp;
a lasso or loop with your closes necktie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:50.080
belts and the cables lying around in this room&nbsp;
you would have had a chance to swing it around&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:55.600
the shotgun and pull it out of alignment because&nbsp;
have a look here we can clearly see that there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:55.600 --> 00:13:01.520
is no further metal grid denying axis the same&nbsp;
way like behind the gun so this is the opening&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:06.560
where you should try to swing your lasso through&nbsp;
and around the gun and basically save them all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:13.040
in the final trip William realizes that&nbsp;
it's not him who ultimately decides if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:19.120
he shall remain alive but Tara and Brent the&nbsp;
family members of Harold Abbott a guy William&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:25.120
quite literally killed by denying him insurance&nbsp;
cover in the other cage is Pamela Williams sister&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:31.440
i guess her only purpose there is to enjoy the&nbsp;
show not the switching device mounted on the wall&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:37.360
in tara and brad's cave turns out to be the device&nbsp;
that decides if William shall remain alive or not&nbsp;

00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:43.200
if the switch is pulled to the death side a&nbsp;
mechanism will activate that injects hydrophloric&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:48.000
acid directly into his body everyone who has&nbsp;
watched breaking bad or didn't fall asleep&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:53.600
in chemistry class like i did should know that you&nbsp;
want to generally avoid any contact with that acid

00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:04.240
yep exactly hydrofluoric acid burns literally&nbsp;
through anything except plastic "I''m sorry&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:10.160
what were you asking me, oh yes, that&nbsp;
stupid plastic container i asked you to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:15.840
buy" - special thanks to Mr. White here while&nbsp;
terra is not able to pull the switch Brent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:20.480
well he doesn't seem to have an issue with it
William's evasion rate seems to be underpowered&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:25.360
too definitely should have invested more skill&nbsp;
points into that attribute that needle trap could&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:30.720
have been dodged with a nice duck and subsequent&nbsp;
jiu jitsu roll and the acid could have been used&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:36.800
to burn through their cages just soak your clothes&nbsp;
in it and throw it onto the grid this has to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:42.480
done quickly though for obvious reasons by the&nbsp;
way the smoke or haze that arises from Williams&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:48.080
burning is highly toxic all of our remaining&nbsp;
characters could be soon dead too just saying

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:55.680
but anyway let's move on to the bonus the&nbsp;
maestro himself jesus that was so fun to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:55.680 --> 00:15:01.360
watch because this is literally how you&nbsp;
beat the traps like a god does all right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:06.640
at last detective Hoffman himself gets trapped&nbsp;
into one of his own traps the probably most&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:13.280
famous of all saw traps the "jaw splitter" but&nbsp;
he doesn't sound very long he breaks his hand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:17.440
escapes both arm straps and attempts to&nbsp;
release the child splitter from his head&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:23.760
without success though however he succeed in&nbsp;
evading the trap in the most creative way possible

00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:25.840
show them Hoffman.

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:33.120
i could have not done it better what a great&nbsp;
example on how to be the traps in saw six if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:39.840
