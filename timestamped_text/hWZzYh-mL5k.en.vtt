00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.629
If the zombie apocalypse actually happened,
but the zombies were fast as frick, reasonably

00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:10.200
intelligent, and you lived in London where
there are no guns, what would you do?

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.440
In this How to Beat video, we’ll follow
the batshiz insane repatriates, see if we

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.930
can better avoid the hordes of infected, and
ultimately attempt to beat the Rage Virus

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.570
in, 28 Weeks Later.

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.970
If at any point you think i’m wrong, say..
for thinking Doyle should have sniped Andy.

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:26.650
Drop that nonsense in the comments.

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:31.039
If you’ve binge watched all my videos but
you’re not subscribed, you’re doing YouTube

00:00:31.039 --> 00:01:57.870
wrong.

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:03.009
We start out following Don and his wife Alice,
surviving the outbreak which occurred in 28

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:07.509
Days Later, the original movie that people
are going to give me shiz for for not covering

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:08.509
first.

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.280
This isn’t Don and Alice’s house.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.750
They live in the city but luckily managed
to get out during all the chaos, which I imagine

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.421
was like Philly in World War Z.

00:02:16.421 --> 00:02:28.780
It’s been a week or so since the outbreak,
so the zombies are relatively fresh, and fast.

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.720
Let’s clear this up real quick, I know they
aren’t legit ‘zombies’, but that’s

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.110
what I’m going to call them.

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.250
Calling them ‘the infected’, just makes
it sound like they are suffering from an affliction.

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.640
These things are adrenaline pumped, blood-vomiting,
heat-seeking, ravenous cannibals.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.190
They’re fricking zombies.

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.730
What I like about 28 Weeks Later is that the
zombies are just normal humans gone crazy-er.

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.260
There’s no magic bullshiz like in Dawn of
the Dead, where the zombies don’t die from

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.720
anything other than a bullet to the head.

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.720
Infection, dehydration, starvation, and blood
loss are lethal conditions for those infected

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.180
with the Rage Virus.

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.630
Human mouths are filled with bacteria and
will cause severe, potentially deadly infections

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.940
if untreated, which will be the case because
zombies don’t go to hospitals.

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.650
These aren’t bites from your bastard 5 year
old nephew that barely breaks skin.

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:19.540
These are full grown adults trying to eat
your face off and chew through your neck.

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.560
The Rage Virus also causes internal hemorrhaging
and zombies to puke blood everywhere.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.480
Infection and blood loss are going to cause
the first 10f-20 percent of the zombies to

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.680
die out within the first days or weeks.

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.980
The 80% of the zombies that survived their
initial wounds will be faced with starvation

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.570
and dehydration.

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.930
While Don and Alice never saw the zombies
eat or drink during their escape because they

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.490
were too busy trying not to get murdered by
everyone, it’s not safe for them to assume

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:50.410
that the infected won’t try to eat or drink
by scavenging, cannibalizing each other, persistence

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.870
hunting animals, and drinking whatever water
they find.

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.980
You don’t want to walk into town assuming
that everyone’s died of inanition and realize

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.690
your hypothesis was wrong.

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:04.190
Cannibalizing each other, eating uncooked
foods, and drinking river water is going to

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:09.870
cause the zombies to be riddled with other
diseases that make them vomit and shiz everywhere,

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.900
leading to more dehydration and illness related
deaths.

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.870
Still, it will take a lot longer for them
to die out.

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.400
That and not everyone will be infected at
the same time.

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.060
As bands of survivors get infected over the
following weeks, the time it will take for

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.050
them to die out will be even longer.

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.379
For Don, Alice, and the others living in the
home, survival is an uphill battle of attrition

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:30.629
that may take up to a year.

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:33.130
Their primary concern is not being spotted.

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:37.570
The home they’re sheltering in is situated
many miles into the outskirts of London, I'm

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:41.960
guessing somewhere Eastward along one of the
streams that connects to River Thames.

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.370
Far enough that the millions of infected in
the city won’t find them.

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:49.840
This is more of a psychological consolation
than a realistic advantage.

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.889
Even one or two zombies could easily overpower
them.

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:57.060
This isn’t America where every household
has enough firepower to mow down every living

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:01.479
thing in a 2 mile radius 4 times over, with
a gun store down the road so they can do it

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:02.479
again.

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:03.479
This is Britain.

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:07.150
They have diddly shiz in the way of guns,
which is about the only way you can fight

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.240
those infected with the Rage Virus.

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.711
Getting into a fistfight with them is pretty
much guaranteed death, as one scratch, one

00:05:13.711 --> 00:05:17.870
spittle in your eye, and you turn into another
zombie trying to kill what used to be your

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:18.870
family.

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:22.789
If they need to go outside for any reason,
they need to do it under the cover of darkness.

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:27.289
It’s possible the zombies don’t sleep
from the uncontrolled anger they are experiencing,

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:31.880
and that they are actively trying to hunt
down any uninfected humans night and day.

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:36.319
Humans can stay awake for weeks, even months
without sleep or with micro naps.

00:05:36.319 --> 00:05:39.949
They should assume they’re still being hunted
at night, but at least the zombies will have

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:41.310
more trouble seeing them.

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:45.990
The human sense of smell isn’t that great,
but any scented candles or cigarettes should

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:46.990
be avoided.

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:49.749
They also have a hell of a lot of China propped
up high.

00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:53.389
If someone knocks that over while a zombie
is rummaging through their garbage, they’re

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:54.389
all dead.

00:05:54.389 --> 00:05:56.479
Package all that shiz and put it on the ground.

00:05:56.479 --> 00:05:58.990
Their secondary concern is drinkable water.

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:03.059
Distilling water from the nearby river at
night and collecting rainwater in barrels

00:06:03.059 --> 00:06:04.750
should be able to sustain them.

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:06.980
Their tertiary concern is food.

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:08.289
This is the hard one.

00:06:08.289 --> 00:06:12.999
Their home is well stocked with cans of tomato
soup, chickpeas, and bottled wine.

00:06:12.999 --> 00:06:16.550
Presumably enough for a couple months max
with six mouths to feed.

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:18.580
That’s not the biggest problem though.

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:19.580
Cooking it is.

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:22.970
The rage virus may have turned everyone into
young men who are on the losing side of a

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:34.370
call of duty game,

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:36.800
But they still have eyes, ears, and noses.

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.009
Well most of them.

00:06:38.009 --> 00:06:39.490
Some may have their noses bitten off.

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:43.309
Point is, the smoke billowing out of your
chimney might as well be a dinner bell for

00:06:43.309 --> 00:06:45.069
all the starving zombies nearby.

00:06:45.069 --> 00:06:49.069
You’re going to want to cook at night only,
very briefly, and moderate how much smoke

00:06:49.069 --> 00:06:50.580
is being put out at once.

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:54.740
If I can smell someone barbecuing from a block
away, you better bet the zombies can sniff

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:57.539
out the chef boyardee you’re cooking on
your wood stove.

00:06:57.539 --> 00:07:01.110
It’s not even just the zombies you want
to hide from, you’d also want to remain

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:06.400
unseen by roaming bands of scav’s or desperate
survivors who will lead zombies to your front

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:10.820
door.

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:18.439
Great, someone saw the smoke coming out of
your chimney because you decided to cook with

00:07:18.439 --> 00:07:20.449
a wood stove in broad daylight.

00:07:20.449 --> 00:07:23.699
Now some kid is forcing you into a lose lose
situation.

00:07:23.699 --> 00:07:27.759
You let the kid die and have to live with
it, or let in another mouth you have to feed

00:07:27.759 --> 00:07:30.539
and risk being seen by the infected chasing
him.

00:07:30.539 --> 00:07:35.089
Or the third scenario, the kid is a scav scout
that is using your empathy against you to

00:07:35.089 --> 00:07:39.430
infiltrate your home and signal to his friends
that you are unarmed and well-stocked so they

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:41.690
can come kill you and steal your supplies.

00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:45.539
Personally, and I know I'm saying this from
my comfy chair with no skin in the game..

00:07:45.539 --> 00:07:46.750
I'd let the kid die.

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:51.490
His screaming indicates immediate danger with
zombies in close vicinity behind him, possibly

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:55.289
within eyesight, in which case opening the
door is a death sentence.

00:07:55.289 --> 00:07:59.029
If he ran over here and had lost the zombies,
he’d be more discreet about it.

00:07:59.029 --> 00:08:02.789
Then again, they’ve been cooking up a feast
so at that point the zombies were already

00:08:02.789 --> 00:08:04.979
onto them regardless of the boy knocking.

00:08:04.979 --> 00:08:09.020
The young lady opening the blinds to see if
her missing boyfriend was out there is beyond

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:10.020
moronic.

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:13.710
The zombies chasing the boy are probably lurking
around the house looking for him, and if her

00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:16.580
boy toy is out there, he’s probably undateable.

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:19.719
The fact that the infected haven’t barged
through your home is lucky enough.

00:08:19.719 --> 00:08:23.289
If you’re going to look outside, it’d
be better to do it from the attic so you aren’t

00:08:23.289 --> 00:08:24.909
at eye level with the infected.

00:08:24.909 --> 00:08:28.969
This is what happens when you try to hold
up with too many PTSD stricken people in the

00:08:28.969 --> 00:08:30.069
apocalypse.

00:08:30.069 --> 00:08:36.820
Someone is going to do something stupid.

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:39.419
Holy shiz those wood barricades did nothing.

00:08:39.419 --> 00:08:42.280
Who was this zombie, Jean Claude Van Damme?

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:45.370
Helping whoever is under attack is a waste
of precious time.

00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:48.389
One scratch and the person you’re helping
is going to be trying to kill you.

00:08:48.389 --> 00:08:51.790
You’re all basically dead now unless you
have a stocked vehicle in the shed with the

00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:56.220
keys in the ignition or a super secret crawl
space you can all quickly hide in.

00:08:56.220 --> 00:09:00.740
Also, everyone should have had something on
them to use as a weapon at all times, or atleast

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:02.410
sharpened sticks in each room.

00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:06.970
I know I said fighting is futile, but if you
have to fight, a sharpened stick is better

00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:08.240
than bare knuckle brawling.

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:24.259
Seriously, did they cover their windows up
with styrofoam painted to look like wood?

00:09:24.259 --> 00:09:28.519
The time slowing down at this moment perfectly
encapsulated the intensity . I’ll probably

00:09:28.519 --> 00:09:30.779
get shiz for it, but frick Alice.

00:09:30.779 --> 00:09:34.580
She knew seconds mattered and prioritized
the dumb little kid that led zombies to their

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:37.550
doorstep over her husband who she’d been
married to for decades.

00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:42.430
What the frick was Don going to do, judo chop
it in the neck and swoop you off your feet

00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:43.430
to safety.

00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:45.200
You dicked around in the open and got caught.

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:46.570
That’s not his fault.

00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:50.980
Not to mention you both have kids which will
be orphaned if Don gets himself killed too.

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:55.699
Don justifiably uses his wife as a distraction
to make the run of all runs.

00:09:55.699 --> 00:09:57.700
The zombies in the house weren’t the only
ones.

00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:06.520
There’s an entire horde of zombies coming
down the hill in a dead sprint towards him.

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:08.720
Tom Cruise doesn’t have shiz on Don.

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:11.279
Don screams at Jacob to hurry his ass up.

00:10:11.279 --> 00:10:12.819
Seems Jacob had the same idea.

00:10:12.819 --> 00:10:15.610
Don crank starts the motor while Jacob untethers
the boat.

00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:19.389
With zombies right on his ass he kicks the
boat off the dock and tries to jump in.

00:10:19.389 --> 00:10:22.990
He fails to stick the landing and ends up
in the zombie infested waters.

00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:27.449
Don kicks the zombified Jacob off and manages
to pull away from the rest of the infected.

00:10:27.449 --> 00:10:31.010
How the hell could you get a good night's
rest ever again after that.

00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:35.350
With nowhere else to go, Don continues cruising
down the River Thames where he’s found and

00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:37.070
picked up by a military unit.

00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:41.930
At this point you might be wondering, if they
had a boat, why the frick didn’t they just

00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:43.139
cruise out of town.

00:10:43.139 --> 00:10:45.339
And ya know what, it's a good question.

00:10:45.339 --> 00:10:49.810
According to this boat capacity calculator,
it could’ve held all 6 of them.

00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:54.040
If not, you could always leave the elderly
couple since they’ll just be deadweight.

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:57.920
From their likely location along the River
Thames, it’d be about an 80 mile journey

00:10:57.920 --> 00:10:59.820
across the English Channel.

00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:03.819
With spare gas, and 4-6 people, you could
cover at least half that on power.

00:11:03.819 --> 00:11:07.860
They’ll need to bring paddles to row the
rest of the way, commandeer another boat,

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:09.500
or siphon more gas.

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:13.300
If there is a military presence, they’d
be setting up camp in the harbours east of

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:14.300
London.

00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:17.230
They don’t know if the rest of the world
is fricked too, and if they’ll show up on

00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:21.529
the beaches of France only to find more zombies,
but it’s worth the risk and beats the hell

00:11:21.529 --> 00:11:25.880
out of skulking around a cottage in a populated
area where one wrong move results in your

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:26.880
death.

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:29.120
15 days later mainland Britain is quarantined.

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:32.440
It took, what, 3 weeks for a proper quarantine
to be set up.

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:35.860
I’m surprised more zombies didn’t slip
through by boat or plane.

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:37.860
That’s a piss poor response time.

00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:41.949
By the 4th week, the bulk of the destruction
had occurred and nearly everyone except small

00:11:41.949 --> 00:11:44.569
pockets of survivors remained uninfected.

00:11:44.569 --> 00:11:49.130
The CDC or whatever state organization is
mishandling this operation is saying that

00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:52.399
after 5 whole weeks the infected had died
from starvation.

00:11:52.399 --> 00:11:53.529
5 weeks.

00:11:53.529 --> 00:11:54.529
Really?

00:11:54.529 --> 00:11:55.529
5.

00:11:55.529 --> 00:11:56.530
That is total bullshiz.

00:11:56.530 --> 00:11:59.819
Most people have enough fat stores to last
them months without food.

00:11:59.819 --> 00:12:04.771
Maybe most died from dehydration or any of
the reasons I mentioned earlier, but 5 weeks

00:12:04.771 --> 00:12:06.670
is really underestimating it.

00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:12.610
On the 11th week Team America shows up and
takes a mere 7 weeks to eradicate all zombies

00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:15.860
and declare all of Mainland Britain free of
infection.

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:21.190
There is no way every nook and cranny of every
structure, let alone every square mile of

00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:23.960
countryside was cleared in 7 weeks.

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:28.160
Even if all the infected humans were destroyed,
rodents could be harbouring the virus and

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:30.949
pockets of survivors could also pose a danger.

00:12:30.949 --> 00:12:34.410
At 24 weeks, they begin reconstruction of
the damage done.

00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:39.259
4 weeks later, all the damage done by the
zombie apocalypse was repaired.

00:12:39.259 --> 00:12:40.759
Yah, right.

00:12:40.759 --> 00:12:45.330
It takes the government a year to redo a street,
but the entirety of London was patched up

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:46.690
in 4 weeks.

00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:49.720
At 28 weeks they start moving people back
in.

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:54.339
No sane intelligent person would trust their
governments word that they eradicated a zombie

00:12:54.339 --> 00:12:57.889
infestation in 18 weeks and that it’s safe
to move in.

00:12:57.889 --> 00:13:02.389
London would have to be a giant nuke crater
for me to consider moving back in.

00:13:02.389 --> 00:13:05.149
I think I'd just get citizenship somewhere
else.

00:13:05.149 --> 00:13:09.459
Oh that’s where you draw the line.

00:13:09.459 --> 00:13:10.459
Children.

00:13:10.459 --> 00:13:14.889
Not the completely insane idea of migrating
tens of thousands of people back into what’s

00:13:14.889 --> 00:13:19.100
realistically still an infected hot zone,
not 4 months after the first military unit

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:20.110
arrived in the country.

00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:22.899
I’d be less worried about moving into Syria.

00:13:22.899 --> 00:13:28.050
Not really, but it’s close enough that voluntarily
choosing to go is batshiz insane.

00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:31.529
As evidenced by the soldiers present every
10 feet you walk.

00:13:31.529 --> 00:13:35.389
You’d think all of these former residents
that managed to catch the last flights out

00:13:35.389 --> 00:13:38.990
of Britain during the outbreak would have
been tracked down, quarantined, and assessed

00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:42.089
as soon as they landed in populated areas.

00:13:42.089 --> 00:13:43.089
But no.

00:13:43.089 --> 00:13:48.680
The military is checking for signs of infection
on their return to post-apocalyptic London.

00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:54.330
By their logic, in order to be allowed into
the infected zone, you need to prove you aren’t

00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:57.790
infected by getting eye-popped at the interim
airport optometrist.

00:13:57.790 --> 00:14:02.110
The military’s plan is to clear the Isle
of Dog’s section of London, repopulate it

00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:07.200
with people, and then I guess repeat the same
process with other sections of London and

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:08.200
Britain.

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:09.459
I honestly don’t see what’s the rush.

00:14:09.459 --> 00:14:12.810
It’s not like there are millions of British
people that were displaced.

00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:14.600
They’re pretty much all dead.

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:17.490
The thousands remaining can go somewhere else
for a while.

00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:21.370
They could at least have waited to move people
in until after they finished bagging up and

00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:26.930
burning all the bodies.

00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:31.930
Not to mention you’re surrounded by 40 square
miles of uncleared infected city potentially

00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:34.459
inhabited by thousands of the living dead.

00:14:34.459 --> 00:14:38.350
Even if the humans are all dead, did nobody
think that maybe these rats and wild dogs

00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:40.839
could be spreading or carrying the disease?

00:14:40.839 --> 00:14:44.490
They also failed to mention that there might
be bands of survivors that are dangerous and

00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:47.560
on edge, and may kill you if they think you’re
infected.

00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:51.379
But yah, you guys are safe, there’s just
some stray dogs to watch out for.

00:14:51.379 --> 00:14:56.689
The tour guide tells them that 15,000 potential
zombies have already moved into District 1,

00:14:56.689 --> 00:15:01.790
they have hot and cold running water that
may or may not be sterilized, and even ‘a

00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:02.790
pub’.

00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:05.310
That last one sure gave everyone quite the
chuckle.

00:15:05.310 --> 00:15:09.199
You dumbfricks, you’re walking into one
of the most dangerous places on the face of

00:15:09.199 --> 00:15:10.199
the planet.

00:15:10.199 --> 00:15:14.089
And you giggle because some soldiers fixed
up the Winchester Tavern and stocked it with

00:15:14.089 --> 00:15:15.089
Natty Light?

00:15:15.089 --> 00:15:18.660
I guess it makes sense considering you were
dumb enough to volunteer for this experiment

00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:19.660
in the first place.

00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:23.360
If you were concerned about living standards,
London should have been at the bottom of your

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:24.360
list.

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:26.149
Thank you.

00:15:26.149 --> 00:15:30.600
At least someone is raising concerns for how
fricked this is.

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:32.480
General Stone tells her not to worry.

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:35.189
That if it comes back, they will simply kill
it.

00:15:35.189 --> 00:15:39.240
Being a soldier you should know that if it
comes back, containment will fail, and they

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:44.430
will bomb the Isle of Dogs into dirt along
with every uninfected survivor residing there.

00:15:44.430 --> 00:15:47.540
Tammy and Andy are reunited with their father,
Don.

00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:51.920
After the little mishap at the cottage months
ago, he cruised right into a military camp

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:53.790
where they promoted him to section officer.

00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:58.420
He’s in charge of making sure this shizshow
has enough electricity, so the military in

00:15:58.420 --> 00:16:03.800
their infinite wisdom gave him an all access
backstage pass to even the most secure areas.

00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:07.529
That decision definitely won’t come back
to bite them in the ass.

00:16:07.529 --> 00:16:11.160
Don shows them the penthouse suite that they’ll
be staying at, and sits them down to have

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:27.730
the talk about why their mom isn’t there.

00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:32.189
Jesus go give your dad a hug you senseless
children.

00:16:32.189 --> 00:16:36.810
No, like he said, there was nothing he could
do.

00:16:36.810 --> 00:16:39.370
If there was, don’t you think he’d have
done it.

00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:41.920
Give your dad the benefit of the doubt for
fricks sake.

00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:46.120
You were frolicking in Paris in complete safety
while he lived in a constant life and death

00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:50.560
situation with fast as frick hopped up cannibal
lunatics trying to slaughter them.

00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:54.449
Doyle and all the Delta snipers are providing
overwatch at night while everyone attempts

00:16:54.449 --> 00:16:55.920
to get a decent night's sleep.

00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:59.950
You’d think it’d be hard when your apartment
is at the epicenter of the deadliest viral

00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:04.699
outbreak mankinds ever faced, with millions
of dead bodies surrounding your island that

00:17:04.699 --> 00:17:08.130
experienced unimaginable horrors in their
final moments.

00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:10.510
I’m sure Flynn could have gotten a nice
room.

00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:11.510
But I get it.

00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:15.220
I’d be sleeping in my chopper seat ready
to go at a moment's notice too.

00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:19.689
He’s flying a variant of the Gazelle helicopter
which can have doors on it.

00:17:19.689 --> 00:17:26.470
Why he chose to remove them in this environment
beats me.

00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:30.000
If for no other reason than to prevent sick
pranks like this.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.990
Flynn jokes about shooting Doyle, but seriously,
that’s how you get shot.

00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:35.460
Like Bill Murray in Zombieland.

00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:41.690
It’s all jokes until someone freaks out
and pulls the trigger.

00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:47.789
Naturally, the first day after the kids arrive,
they somehow think it’s a smart idea and

00:17:47.789 --> 00:17:52.789
somehow manage to sneak out of a highly guarded
quarantine zone to go explore the restricted

00:17:52.789 --> 00:17:55.740
zone without being shot or immediately captured.

00:17:55.740 --> 00:18:00.151
Tammy wants to snag the keys to the scooter,
which isn’t a terrible idea if you are hell

00:18:00.151 --> 00:18:03.900
bent on exploring restricted zombie plagued
areas of the city.

00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:07.890
Should a runner bust out of a shop and give
chase, you do not want to be on foot.

00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:10.470
At least she got the helmet for Andy, safety
first.

00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:14.850
Tammy and Andy reach their former home and
split up to raid their own rooms.

00:18:14.850 --> 00:18:18.570
Andy gets his picture of his mom and hops
around on the trampoline before heading back

00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:20.100
in to find Tammy.

00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:21.740
Only he doesn’t find Tammy.

00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:26.440
To his surprise, he finds his non-zombified,
very much alive mom who's been holding out

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:27.440
in their attic.

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:31.720
She must’ve had an immunity to the virus,
and the zombies just moved on thinking she

00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:33.049
was infected too.

00:18:33.049 --> 00:18:37.390
Alice had no way of knowing about the military
camp and decided to sneak back into town to

00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:38.549
try to ride it out.

00:18:38.549 --> 00:18:42.890
If I was her, I’d try to find a new shelter
further into the countryside.

00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:45.059
The city would have been packed with zombies.

00:18:45.059 --> 00:18:49.260
Yes, she has an immunity and the infected
probably won’t attack her since they let

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:51.020
her go after infecting her.

00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:52.020
But..

00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:55.990
Do you really want to chance it waltzing into
a million strong horde like Brad Pitt in World

00:18:55.990 --> 00:18:56.990
War Z?

00:18:56.990 --> 00:19:01.029
Like I was saying earlier, they might start
cannibalizing each other, including you when

00:19:01.029 --> 00:19:02.740
starvation starts to hit.

00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:06.880
The military tracked the kids down and took
Alice back to their ‘secure’ labs for

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:08.880
decontamination and assessment.

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:10.400
Well this is awkward.

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:14.770
Not to worry citizens, we were just a little
wrong about the whole, everyone in London

00:19:14.770 --> 00:19:19.630
was dead, thing.

00:19:19.630 --> 00:19:22.340
Why are people always so dramatic when they
are essentially getting bathed?

00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:25.260
They aren’t branding you with a hot iron.

00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:28.850
Scarlet’s performing the assessment of Alice
with pretty minimal PPE.

00:19:28.850 --> 00:19:34.559
I think a survivor who is potentially an asymptomatic
carrier of the Rage Virus warrants a level

00:19:34.559 --> 00:19:38.520
4 bio suit until you are absolutely sure she’s
clean.

00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:42.730
Scarlet puts Alice’s blood under the microscope
and concludes that she’s infected, but that

00:19:42.730 --> 00:19:45.250
she has a genetic immunity to it.

00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:49.200
Scarlet thinks that her blood contains the
key to a vaccine, or even a cure.

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:56.140
Correct me if I'm wrong internet virologists,
but if she has a natural immunity, aka a genetic

00:19:56.140 --> 00:20:00.909
immunity, she will never have had an immune
response to the virus, and thus her blood

00:20:00.909 --> 00:20:05.180
doesn’t contain the antibodies necessary
to create a vaccine nor a cure.

00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:09.419
Even if there were living infected people,
which there aren’t per your estimations,

00:20:09.419 --> 00:20:14.141
and even if you were able to create a cure
with her blood, which you can’t, how would

00:20:14.141 --> 00:20:18.669
you plan on administering it to the zombies,
and what’s the plan for rehabilitating and

00:20:18.669 --> 00:20:21.210
reintegrating ex-zombies?

00:20:21.210 --> 00:20:25.010
Clearly you’re not qualified for this position
nor have you thought through the realities

00:20:25.010 --> 00:20:26.710
and logistics for this situation.

00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:31.580
I’m not saying they should kill Alice because
she’s useless and dangerous, but they should

00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:34.940
kill Alice because she’s useless and dangerous.

00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:39.500
General Stone’s one intelligent decision
in this dumpster fire is to incinerate Alice

00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:41.600
since she poses too great of a risk.

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:44.710
And herein lies the pinnacle of stupidity
in this movie.

00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:49.190
The fricking maintenance man has access to
containment quarters for possibly infected

00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:54.470
survivors and labs, which are totally unguarded
by soldiers and unmonitored by surveillance

00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:55.470
cameras.

00:20:55.470 --> 00:20:59.500
The TSA had a 50 cal machine gun trained on
the people entering the infected zone.

00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:04.029
But the sole survivor of the apocalypse who's
a carrier for the disease effectively doesn’t

00:21:04.029 --> 00:21:05.029
have a locked door.

00:21:05.029 --> 00:21:09.799
You’d think that they’d piece together
that Alice is Don's wife, Don has the dumbarse

00:21:09.799 --> 00:21:14.270
all access pass to their infected labs where
she’s kept, and maybe he’d want to pay

00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:15.700
her a visit?

00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:16.700
Nah.

00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:17.700
Totally unthinkable.

00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:23.020
Don ignores any safety precautions or general
common sense, and starts making out with his

00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:27.220
detained, shell-shocked wife that’s strapped
to a chair because she may be infected.

00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:29.140
It doesn’t take long for the virus to kick
in.

00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:46.730
Jesus Christ.

00:21:46.730 --> 00:21:50.420
Don still has the wherewithal to slide his
badge through the card reader to open the

00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:52.880
door so he can start attacking everyone.

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:56.480
Nobody can get their pistol up to shoot him
in time, so the situation escalates out of

00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:58.280
control exponentially.

00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:01.789
General Stone executes their Code Red when
they physically arrive at the containment

00:22:01.789 --> 00:22:06.330
room and find Alice’s mutilated corpse,
because they didn’t have security cameras

00:22:06.330 --> 00:22:07.860
which were being monitored.

00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:12.840
The Code Red procedure is to move everyone
into ‘designated containment bunkers’.

00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:17.460
Good luck orderly ushering fifteen thousand
panicking people into some distant bunker

00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:19.620
in time while zombies are on the loose.

00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:23.730
While the Code Red is popping off, Andy and
Tammy are being held in another quarantine

00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:25.700
area.

00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:29.520
Why would you even say or think this?

00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:31.929
It's a Code Red meaning there’s a zombie
outbreak.

00:22:31.929 --> 00:22:35.990
The same one that had claimed over 60 million
lives in the span of a week.

00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:41.270
That’s almost as many as World War 2 claimed
in 6 years of brutal combat and genocide.

00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:44.750
The seriousness of the situation can’t be
overstated.

00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:49.740
This idiot nonchalantly walks into a hallway
lit with flickering emergency lights completely

00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:50.740
unarmed.

00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:53.809
I don’t care if you’re Barney Ross, get
your gun up so you don’t have to try to

00:22:53.809 --> 00:22:57.660
unholster it if a zombie starts running at
you.

00:22:57.660 --> 00:23:00.299
Yah, like that.

00:23:00.299 --> 00:23:03.909
Scarlet comes to their rescue with her gun
up clearing rooms like you should, and tries

00:23:03.909 --> 00:23:08.279
to get them onto a chopper out of the danger
zone because she still falsely thinks their

00:23:08.279 --> 00:23:09.710
blood harbours the cure.

00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:12.880
It’s too chaotic and they end up getting
separated by the soldiers.

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:17.309
The ‘secure bunkers’ are actually just
underground parking garages that are locked

00:23:17.309 --> 00:23:20.059
up less securely than an ice cream store at
night.

00:23:20.059 --> 00:23:24.429
Hell, thousands of people piled into a small
area might as well be an ice cream store for

00:23:24.429 --> 00:23:25.549
the zombies.

00:23:25.549 --> 00:23:29.950
Middle school teachers have a better code
red procedure for hostile visitors.

00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:32.590
Everyone goes to their rooms, locks up, and
hides.

00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:36.490
The first 2 floors of each residential building
should have been up-armored with unbreakable

00:23:36.490 --> 00:23:41.150
plexi-glass with a platoon of soldiers guarding
the lobby, stairwell, and hallways.

00:23:41.150 --> 00:23:45.340
Blueprints for each building should be assessed
so that all other entrances could be sealed

00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:46.700
or guarded.

00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:50.580
Snipers on the rooftops can pick off the zombies
running through the streets or attacking the

00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:51.580
entrances.

00:23:51.580 --> 00:23:54.000
Andy hears some banging on the back entrance
of the parking garage.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:24:02.409
It’s his raged out dad.

00:24:02.409 --> 00:24:04.419
Did that door even have a lock on it?

00:24:04.419 --> 00:24:06.519
So much for a secure containment area.

00:24:06.519 --> 00:24:11.039
All the survivors crammed into this garage
just became an all you can eat zombie buffet.

00:24:11.039 --> 00:24:14.559
Andy climbs up on a car to escape through
the vent shaft.

00:24:14.559 --> 00:24:18.060
Pretty clever move compared to everyone else
screaming and running for the same locked

00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:19.060
door.

00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:23.740
It was insanely lucky that the shaft was right
over a car, that it could be opened, and that

00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:25.420
nobody else tried to follow him.

00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:28.490
The chained and locked front entrance didn’t
even stop the horde.

00:24:28.490 --> 00:24:30.510
The military really didn’t think this through.

00:24:30.510 --> 00:24:34.390
At least tell me they have a flamethrower
or nerve gas grenades.

00:24:34.390 --> 00:24:38.179
Nope, just a few soldiers with M4s, great.

00:24:38.179 --> 00:24:42.280
Initially the soldiers try to pick off the
infected, but it’s near impossible.

00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:47.620
Within seconds, General Stone gives the order
to abandon selective targeting.

00:24:47.620 --> 00:24:59.260
If you were in that group of fleeing people,
I think your best option is to just lay down

00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:00.260
and act dead.

00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:03.110
It’s a virus where people attack anything
that moves and looks uninfected.

00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:06.220
If you are still, they will probably run past
you.

00:25:06.220 --> 00:25:09.600
That and you’re far less likely to catch
a bullet from the soldiers.

00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:13.230
Scarlet gets on the comms to tell all the
soldiers to spare and evacuate a little boy.

00:25:13.230 --> 00:25:14.880
Andy shouldn't be too hard to spot.

00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:17.429
He is the only child in District 1.

00:25:17.429 --> 00:25:21.250
The problem is that she failed to give the
soldiers a legitimate reason not to kill him.

00:25:21.250 --> 00:25:23.799
Andy better hope he doesn’t end up in someone’s
sights.

00:25:23.799 --> 00:25:27.130
I actually think all the soldiers should be
actively targeting Andy.

00:25:27.130 --> 00:25:32.230
His genetic immunity won’t enable them to
make a vaccine or cure, and makes him an inconspicuous

00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:33.730
carrier of the virus.

00:25:33.730 --> 00:25:36.299
He’s far more dangerous than the zombies.

00:25:36.299 --> 00:25:40.840
Why Andy decided to pop out of the ventilation
shaft right in the middle of all this is beyond

00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:41.840
me.

00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:45.279
Doyle saves Andy with a clutch shot, and some
store owner waves him into safety.

00:25:45.279 --> 00:25:46.990
The snipers aren’t too smart either.

00:25:46.990 --> 00:25:54.409
They didn’t secure the rooftop hatches and
now they’re getting attacked.

00:25:54.409 --> 00:25:58.240
Compared to the dumbarse zombies in World
War Z who anthill up a building side to get

00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:02.240
to the top, the Rage infected are pretty damn
intelligent for spotting the snipers from

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:05.789
ground level, navigating their way through
the building, and finding the roof entrance

00:26:05.789 --> 00:26:07.210
in order to attack them.

00:26:07.210 --> 00:26:12.640
In a stroke of mad luck, Tammy and Scarlet
were at the shop Andy was drawn into.

00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:17.060
Scarlet says the obvious, that the military
is going to exterminate this entire area now.

00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:21.460
They need to find a way out of District 1
before it gets nuked, while avoiding getting

00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:24.250
eaten by zombies or shot down by snipers.

00:26:24.250 --> 00:26:28.540
Doyle heard Scarlet’s bullshiz call for
help about the VIP child earlier, and headed

00:26:28.540 --> 00:26:29.750
down to help.

00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:35.320
That and the military didn’t line up helicopter
extractions for their own snipers.

00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:39.710
He says that right now the snipers are preoccupied
with shooting the infected running around,

00:26:39.710 --> 00:26:43.130
and that their night vision scopes have a
fairly narrow field of view.

00:26:43.130 --> 00:26:47.641
If they sleuth around under the cover of darkness,
they have a chance that z’s and snipers

00:26:47.641 --> 00:26:49.080
both won’t see them.

00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:53.159
Not that they have a choice, because this
place will likely be nuked within the hour.

00:26:53.159 --> 00:26:56.419
They need to get into the restricted zone
and commandeer a vehicle they can drive back

00:26:56.419 --> 00:26:59.550
to base, or find an LZ that Flynn can pick
them up at.

00:26:59.550 --> 00:27:03.300
Doyle makes sure everyone is on his arse and
moves out for the restricted area.

00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:07.250
He’s got a rail mounted night vision scope
on his AR, but no suppressor.

00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:09.960
The lack of a suppressor is a real problem.

00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:13.390
If he fires, everyone, sniper and infected
will hear it.

00:27:13.390 --> 00:27:17.720
Flynn and Doyle get comms and Flynn lets him
know that in 4 minutes District 1 will be

00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:19.660
firebombed into a hellscape.

00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:22.399
Flynn tells him to go to Regents park for
extraction.

00:27:22.399 --> 00:27:24.309
Why, that’s like 10 miles away.

00:27:24.309 --> 00:27:28.270
Doyle should have given Flynn his current
location so they could coordinate a closer

00:27:28.270 --> 00:27:29.270
LZ.

00:27:29.270 --> 00:27:31.210
Like Greenwich Park that’s just south of
them.

00:27:31.210 --> 00:27:34.580
With only a couple minutes until they get
turned into crispy critters, there’s no

00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:36.019
time for lollygagging.

00:27:36.019 --> 00:27:40.769
They need to sprint for the water or Greenwich
Foot Tunnel.

00:27:40.769 --> 00:27:46.470
What are the snipers still doing in District
1 if the whole place is minutes from being

00:27:46.470 --> 00:27:47.700
firebombed.

00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:50.580
Luckily he only killed a few randoms that
nobody cares about.

00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:52.409
He did clip Scarlet’s leg.

00:27:52.409 --> 00:27:53.919
That’s going to be a problem.

00:27:53.919 --> 00:27:58.700
Sorry Scarlet, but if the infected start chasing
us you’re on your own.

00:27:58.700 --> 00:28:08.130
Uh, dude, he blasted your Saving Private Ryan
mirror out of your hand immediately with one

00:28:08.130 --> 00:28:10.730
or two shots from a tough angle and distance.

00:28:10.730 --> 00:28:12.019
I’d say he’s good.

00:28:12.019 --> 00:28:16.440
I think Doyles is just saying that to give
his bait, I mean diversion, the confidence

00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:18.860
to run out there so he can get a clean shot.

00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:23.289
He instructs Sam to run in a zig-zag pattern
to throw the sniper off.

00:28:23.289 --> 00:28:27.820
This is generally considered to be bad advice
because it slows you down, thus making you

00:28:27.820 --> 00:28:29.300
an easier target.

00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:34.910
Sam justifiably doesn’t want to play bait,
so Andy takes off and executes a perfect serpentine

00:28:34.910 --> 00:28:35.910
maneuver.

00:28:35.910 --> 00:28:41.799
The sniper somehow misses every shot and gets
dropped by Doyle.

00:28:41.799 --> 00:28:48.799
Doyle’s group hauls arse through the Greenwich
Tunnel just narrowly avoiding the firebombs.

00:28:48.799 --> 00:28:50.340
They weren’t the only ones though.

00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:54.110
The delayed firebombing doesn’t seem like
the best way to handle the situation.

00:28:54.110 --> 00:28:58.429
If they actually had secure bunkers, they
could have pre-installed nerve gas bombs all

00:28:58.429 --> 00:28:59.720
throughout the District.

00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:04.090
Upon Code Red and everyone’s successful
migration into the bunkers, these bombs would

00:29:04.090 --> 00:29:09.200
be set off and all of District 1 would be
safely fumigated without harming the civilians.

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:12.100
The survivors eventually make it to Regents
Park.

00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:13.710
Problem is, there’s zombies out here too.

00:29:13.710 --> 00:29:18.299
Either the zombies from District 1 tracked
them down somehow, or the military was lying

00:29:18.299 --> 00:29:21.130
about all the zombies starving to death in
a couple months.

00:29:21.130 --> 00:29:24.809
Flynn arrives and starts freaking out at the
sight of Doyle’s tag-a-longs.

00:29:24.809 --> 00:29:26.760
I honestly don’t see what the problem is.

00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:29.559
His Gazelle helicopter can easily take them
all.

00:29:29.559 --> 00:29:34.000
We know that if you’re infected you turn
into a zombie within seconds, so he shouldn’t

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.299
have anxiety about that.

00:29:35.299 --> 00:29:39.830
He might think that they could be carriers,
but if Doyle and Scarlet are uninfected, flying

00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:43.090
them all to the nearest quarantine zone shouldn’t
be a problem.

00:29:43.090 --> 00:29:47.630
Flynn’s irrational fear causes Sam to jump
onto his helicopter for fear of being left.

00:29:47.630 --> 00:29:51.450
Sam’s made out to be a little bitch, but
the man’s just trying not to die.

00:29:51.450 --> 00:29:54.010
He did save all your lives for Christ sake.

00:29:54.010 --> 00:29:57.799
Flynn pulls incredibly dangerous evasive maneuvers
to shake Sam off.

00:29:57.799 --> 00:30:01.600
At least he heard Doyle screaming for help
on the comm’s and realized he needed to

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:07.210
prioritize mowing down the horde.

00:30:07.210 --> 00:30:11.250
That move saved their arses, but it wouldn’t
have been necessary if Flynn just picked them

00:30:11.250 --> 00:30:12.440
up in the first place.

00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:17.340
Flynn flies off and tells Doyle that he will
extract him and him alone at the Wembley Stadium,

00:30:17.340 --> 00:30:20.039
which is another 8 miles West of their location.

00:30:20.039 --> 00:30:24.370
It’s also a tough spot to land a helicopter
and has terrible sightlines.

00:30:24.370 --> 00:30:28.320
Flynn would be lucky to get the rotors spooled
up in time if zombies burst out of the stands.

00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:33.029
If he was concerned about Doyle’s well-being,
he’d just pick him up now or find a closer

00:30:33.029 --> 00:30:34.029
LZ.

00:30:34.029 --> 00:30:37.520
It’s clear that Doyle isn’t going to leave
the kids, so Flynn’s just risking their

00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:39.419
lives delaying the same discussion.

00:30:39.419 --> 00:30:41.059
That’s if they don’t get overrun.

00:30:41.059 --> 00:30:44.120
There’s no telling how many infected escaped
District 1.

00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:45.120
It could be thousands.

00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:49.010
If even 40 or 50 zombies showed up, Doyle
would easily get overrun.

00:30:49.010 --> 00:30:52.760
He’s putting down the few zombies giving
immediate chase, but his lack of suppressor

00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:56.299
is constantly giving his position away and
attracting more zombies.

00:30:56.299 --> 00:31:00.570
Flynn’s also a piece of shiz because there’s
no way that he didn’t see the giant clouds

00:31:00.570 --> 00:31:03.820
of poison gas rolling towards them and cutting
them off from the LZ.

00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:09.080
Caught between the zombies and toxic gas clouds,
they jump into a nearby car that luckily was

00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:21.360
unlocked.

00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:25.620
I highly doubt they could survive a gas attack
by locking up a Volvo.

00:31:25.620 --> 00:31:29.009
Maybe if it was a Tesla with Bioweapon Defense
Mode activated.

00:31:29.009 --> 00:31:31.299
It does take some time for nerve gas to kill.

00:31:31.299 --> 00:31:34.880
If they can get the car started and drive
out of there they stand a chance.

00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:38.010
If not, they’ll succumb to the gas or get
barbecued by flametroopers.

00:31:38.010 --> 00:31:43.090
I don’t know what’s scarier, the zombies
or firebats swinging their giant torches.

00:31:43.090 --> 00:31:47.000
I highly doubt soldiers would be operating
within clouds of nerve gas.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:48.090
That seems incredibly dangerous.

00:31:48.090 --> 00:31:52.251
I don’t know, maybe it would feel cozy knowing
that zombies couldn’t get to you without

00:31:52.251 --> 00:31:54.059
their nervous systems getting fried.

00:31:54.059 --> 00:31:58.110
The car battery is dead, so Doyle opts to
get out and give it a push start.

00:31:58.110 --> 00:32:02.220
Which is a thing you can do to help start
cars with weak batteries, I didn’t know

00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:03.220
that.

00:32:03.220 --> 00:32:06.679
Doyle getting out and letting in some gas
should still be fine, usually takes a decent

00:32:06.679 --> 00:32:08.550
amount of inhalation to start to kill you.

00:32:08.550 --> 00:32:12.779
I don’t think staying in the car and signalling
to the troopers that you weren’t infected

00:32:12.779 --> 00:32:13.779
would work.

00:32:13.779 --> 00:32:16.690
Even if they didn’t outright torch you,
you’d die from gas exposure.

00:32:16.690 --> 00:32:20.330
Doyle could have gunned down the flame soldiers
and ensured his survival.

00:32:20.330 --> 00:32:24.240
He already set the precedent that he was willing
to kill friendlies for the kids.

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:28.179
However, he probably thought that they’d
be able to escape in the car and he was dead

00:32:28.179 --> 00:32:29.890
from exposure anyways.

00:32:29.890 --> 00:32:32.570
Killing the soldiers was just unnecessary.

00:32:32.570 --> 00:32:40.520
Before Doyle can get back in, the flametroopers
open up.

00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:43.960
Doyle should have handed Scarlet the radio
so they’d have comms with the chopper, and

00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:46.770
so she can explain why the kids are necessary.

00:32:46.770 --> 00:32:52.559
Without it, Flynn is likely to leave them
on site again.

00:32:52.559 --> 00:33:00.429
The Apache pilot needs to be fired for being
unable to hit a 15 year old station wagon

00:33:00.429 --> 00:33:03.310
driving 25 miles an hour in broad daylight.

00:33:03.310 --> 00:33:06.780
If this was real life, they’d all have been
turned into red paste from it’s 30mm chain

00:33:06.780 --> 00:33:07.780
gun.

00:33:07.780 --> 00:33:11.530
I get it’s a Code Red, but it’s still
crazy to me that they’d shoot at a car clearly

00:33:11.530 --> 00:33:15.960
being driven by innocent survivors instead
of trying to extract and quarantine them.

00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:19.590
Scarlet loses the Apache in the subway and
they ditch the car.

00:33:19.590 --> 00:33:22.490
Doyle gave Scarlett his M4, but not the extra
mags.

00:33:22.490 --> 00:33:24.330
Let’s hope she doesn’t need them.

00:33:24.330 --> 00:33:27.630
Even a couple zombies can tank some serious
damage.

00:33:27.630 --> 00:33:31.350
One of them was still walking after getting
it’s torso chopped in half by the helicopter

00:33:31.350 --> 00:33:32.350
rotors.

00:33:32.350 --> 00:33:36.350
Scarlet hangs back and tries to direct Tammy
and Andy through the corpse-littered subway

00:33:36.350 --> 00:33:38.630
with the night vision scope on Doyle’s rifle.

00:33:38.630 --> 00:33:43.380
Doyle’s M4 does have a flashlight, but it’s
too risky to use with the infected all around

00:33:43.380 --> 00:33:46.220
them.

00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:48.830
Can you not scream the second they move in
the wrong direction.

00:33:48.830 --> 00:33:53.350
You’re attracting unwanted attention and
pumping their anxiety levels into the stratosphere.

00:33:53.350 --> 00:33:56.919
How about you lead the way since you have
the night vision scope, they can hold onto

00:33:56.919 --> 00:33:58.970
your shirt and follow your steps.

00:33:58.970 --> 00:34:03.100
That way you don’t have to constantly flag
Tammy and Andy with a hot rifle and they aren’t

00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:13.260
obscuring your field of view if a zombie is
down there.

00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:17.169
Why Tammy and Andy don’t get up and say
they are okay is beyond me.

00:34:17.169 --> 00:34:18.399
You tripped and fell.

00:34:18.399 --> 00:34:19.740
You can still talk.

00:34:19.740 --> 00:34:22.500
Now Scarlet’s yelling and making way too
much noise.

00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:25.889
Through her night scope she sees someone walk
across the corridor.

00:34:25.889 --> 00:34:28.099
Now would be the time to turn the flashlight
on.

00:34:28.099 --> 00:34:34.579
The night scope has too narrow of a field
of view and is too fuzzy with no ambient light.

00:34:34.579 --> 00:34:44.570
And to think, all she would have needed to
do to survive, was squeeze the pressure pad

00:34:44.570 --> 00:34:46.780
on the foregrip to turn on the flashlight.

00:34:46.780 --> 00:34:50.389
Tammy picks up the rifle and looks through
the night scope to see Scarlet’s pummeled

00:34:50.389 --> 00:34:51.389
face.

00:34:51.389 --> 00:34:53.730
She doesn’t take a pulse and leaves thinking
Scarlet’s dead.

00:34:53.730 --> 00:34:56.659
She might be, but she might also just have
been knocked unconscious.

00:34:56.659 --> 00:34:59.000
She wasn’t bitten, so there’s a chance.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.570
Tammy’s got more pressing concerns.

00:35:01.570 --> 00:35:08.099
Like her Dad tearing Andy to pieces.

00:35:08.099 --> 00:35:11.980
Who knew a teenage girl would be more combat
effective than an actual soldier.

00:35:11.980 --> 00:35:16.810
Tammy does make the all too common and unbelievably
stupid mistake of dropping the rifle after

00:35:16.810 --> 00:35:18.730
dispatching the immediate threat.

00:35:18.730 --> 00:35:23.310
Do I really have to point out that other zombies
might be nearby and heard the shots.

00:35:23.310 --> 00:35:26.130
Andy runs off thinking he’s infected from
the bite wound.

00:35:26.130 --> 00:35:29.770
Too bad there’s not a rooftop edge he could
throw himself over if he started foaming at

00:35:29.770 --> 00:35:30.770
the mouth.

00:35:30.770 --> 00:35:34.200
Tammy, I get that you don’t want to leave
Andy, but maybe bring the rifle in case he

00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:35.430
goes rage mode.

00:35:35.430 --> 00:35:38.800
Andy doesn’t turn because he shares the
same genetic immunity as his mom.

00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:43.079
The thought never passes through their heads
that Andy might be harbouring the virus now.

00:35:43.079 --> 00:35:47.329
They arrive at the Wembley Stadium after the
movie cut out another 6 miles of them sneaking

00:35:47.329 --> 00:35:48.550
through the restricted zone.

00:35:48.550 --> 00:35:51.110
Flynn’s there, chilling in the helicopter
with his MP5.

00:35:51.110 --> 00:35:55.700
He doesn’t look too happy about Doyle’s
absence, but lets them on board anyways.

00:35:55.700 --> 00:35:57.210
Terrible timing on your change of heart.

00:35:57.210 --> 00:36:00.390
You got Doyle and Scarlet killed only to take
the kids anyway.

00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:01.400
Oh and Sam.

00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:02.670
Can’t forget about Sam.

00:36:02.670 --> 00:36:06.349
He should have checked them for bite wounds
and gunned Andy down when he found out he

00:36:06.349 --> 00:36:07.460
was infected.

00:36:07.460 --> 00:36:10.740
Instead of taking them to a secure military
camp where they could quarantine and assess

00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:15.030
the kids for infection, he flies them across
the channel into France where Andy spreads

00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:20.550
infectious bodily fluids on every glass cup,
doorknob, metro handrail, and Uber car seat.

00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:30.069
The movie ends with the virus spreading throughout
the entire world and ending 99.98% of life.

00:36:30.069 --> 00:36:33.830
If Don and Alice paddled down the river they’d
have been picked up by the military and her

00:36:33.830 --> 00:36:38.240
immunity wouldn’t have inadvertently caused
the entire human race to go extinct.

00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:42.520
Perhaps the most devastating and preventable
mistake was giving Don a backstage pass and

00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:45.240
not posting guards outside Alice’s containment
room.

00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:49.380
Besides that, Andy getting bitten and hopping
on the next flight to Continental Europe is

00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:52.420
just flat out insane, even for a dumb kid.

00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:55.970
I’m quite confident I could have managed
this situation better than General Stone,

00:36:55.970 --> 00:36:59.050
and Beaten the Rage Virus from 28 Weeks Later.

00:36:59.050 --> 00:37:02.970
My biggest piece of advice for surviving a
zombie apocalypse that I'll leave you with,

00:37:02.970 --> 00:37:06.230
is to be friends with a helicopter pilot.
