00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:07.920
Hi, Mystery Recapped here. Today, I am going to&nbsp;
explain the third and fourth episodes of the South&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:14.080
Korean survival drama “Squid Game” called “The&nbsp;
man with the umbrella” and “Stick to the team”&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.760
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care!
&nbsp;

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.760
In the previous episode, all the main characters&nbsp;
from the show got into vans to go back to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:33.920
facility and gamble their lives for money.&nbsp;
The police officer Junho follows Gu-hun’s van,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.680
still looking for his brother. The van stops in a&nbsp;
harbour where several other vans like it are being&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:45.200
loaded into a ship. Junho latches onto the bottom&nbsp;
of Gi-hun’s van and boards the ship as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:51.280
After some time, the staff in red suits start&nbsp;
inspecting the players by scanning their ears,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:56.080
indicating the players have been inserted&nbsp;
with some device. Junho gets inside a van&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:01.680
and knocks out the staff that tries to inspect&nbsp;
him. He changes into the man’s clothes and mask.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.960
After the others leave, he puts his ID into&nbsp;
the man’s pocket and throws him into the sea.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.000
One of the staff finds Junho and asks what&nbsp;
he is doing. The man is Junho’s superior,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.880
which makes him realize that the shapes on their&nbsp;
masks indicate their positions. He gets out of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.040
situation, saying that he is seasick. 
The ship stops at the island, and all the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:26.000
contestants are taken into a hall. While they&nbsp;
are still unconscious, their clothes are changed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.280
and their belongings are seized. Saebyeok,&nbsp;
who is a bit conscious, manages to sneak in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.800
a pocket knife. The players wake up in the hall&nbsp;
again. Gi-hun reunites with the old man Ilnam.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.800
Sangwoo and Ali join the two as well. They decide&nbsp;
to form a team, so it will be easier to win from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:49.120
the next round. Similarly, the gangster Deoksu&nbsp;
is also forming his own team and asks Saebyeok&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:55.200
to join him. She despises the man and refuses to&nbsp;
be in his team. Their conversation is interrupted&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.000
by Minyeo, the woman who begged the staff to&nbsp;
let her go when they were here previously.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.840
She tries to seduce Deoksu to be in his team,&nbsp;
but he insults her and leaves. Later, the staff&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.960
is told to head back to their room because their&nbsp;
work for the day is done. Junho, who has managed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.280
not to be caught yet, goes to his assigned&nbsp;
room and sees it has a surveillance camera. 
&nbsp;

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.920
At night, Minyeo creates a fuss about wanting to&nbsp;
pee and bangs on the door for the guards to let&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.720
her out. They allow her to go, and Saebyeok&nbsp;
takes the opportunity to go out as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.600
It turns out Minyeo has hidden a packet full of&nbsp;
cigarettes inside her underwear that she starts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:35.040
to smoke. Saebyeok gets inside Minyeo’s stall&nbsp;
and opens the vent on the ceiling with her knife.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.160
She goes in to inspect the facility and ends up&nbsp;
above the kitchen’s vent. In the kitchen, a large&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.520
amount of sugar is being melted. Saebyeok quickly&nbsp;
returns back before the guards can catch her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.839
She tells Minyeo what she saw, but they dismiss&nbsp;
it as unimportant information. Meanwhile, Junho&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:49.839 --> 00:02:50.880
is still in his room, where he texts his superiors&nbsp;
while hiding from the camera. The following day,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.800
the players are woken up and given&nbsp;
bread and some milk as breakfast.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.880
Gi-hun and the team enjoy it together&nbsp;
while talking. They are starting to bond,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.640
especially Ilnam and Gi-hun, who talk&nbsp;
about their old days with each other.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.600
Ali is kind to all of them, while&nbsp;
Sangwoo seems to be void of emotions. 
&nbsp;

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.000
As they talk, an announcement tells them it is&nbsp;
the time for the next game. On their way outside,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.280
Sangwoo asks Saebyeok what she saw yesterday.&nbsp;
It turns out that he had heard her and Minyeo&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.560
talking last night. Saebyeok tells him that the&nbsp;
staff was melting sugar. When they reach outside,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.720
Sangwoo sees several shapes drawn on the&nbsp;
wall and realizes they are playing an old&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:32.160
Korean game where they have to break a sugar&nbsp;
honeycomb snack into a specific shape. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.520
he doesn’t tell his teammates and chooses the&nbsp;
easiest shape for himself. Gi-hun chooses the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:41.840
shape of an umbrella which is the hardest&nbsp;
one, but Sangwoo still doesn’t warn him. 
&nbsp;

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.880
They are given the honeycomb, and Gi-hun realizes&nbsp;
he is in trouble. There is no way he can crack the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:52.240
shape of an umbrella perfectly. Sangwoo and&nbsp;
Saebyeok get a triangle. Ali gets a circle,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:58.320
while Ilnam, Deoksu, and Minyeo get a star. The&nbsp;
game starts, and Sangwoo and Saebyeok easily break&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:04.000
their shapes. Ali gets done soon as well. Minyeo,&nbsp;
on the other hand, hides under a slide and uses a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.440
lighter to melt the sugar easily. Gi-hun and Ilnam&nbsp;
struggle the most. Soon, the staff starts killing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:16.000
people who break their shapes. Sangwoo, Saebyeok,&nbsp;
and Ali get done in no time. Nobody notices Minyeo&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.520
cheating, and she succeeds as well. After passing,&nbsp;
she throws the lighter towards Deoksu to help him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:25.920
although he insulted her earlier. She desperately&nbsp;
wants to be in his team for the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:30.000
Gi-hun realizes that if he licks the&nbsp;
honeycomb, it will get thinner, making it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.640
easier to break it into shapes. People around&nbsp;
him follow his strategy, including Ilnam. 
&nbsp;

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:39.520
At the last moment, he manages to get the shape of&nbsp;
the umbrella out and passes the round. Ilnam does&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:45.200
the same and succeeds too. However, the ones who&nbsp;
failed are killed brutally. The overseer of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:50.400
games watches everyone through a monitor. Junho is&nbsp;
also in the field and is horrified to see the real&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:55.760
truth of the game. A superior with a square on his&nbsp;
mask asks him to do his duties of picking up the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:02.320
bodies and meet him later. One of the players who&nbsp;
failed refuses to die and holds a staff hostage.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:06.960
He makes the man take his mask off and sees&nbsp;
that the guy is a young man. Filled with guilt,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:12.080
the player shoots himself and dies. The overseer&nbsp;
approaches the staff who has just been exposed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:17.520
and shoots him dead, claiming that no one’s face&nbsp;
should be seen. Junho cleans the dead bodies and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:22.400
finds the dead staff’s mask, who happens to be&nbsp;
the superior who called him earlier. He exchanges&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:27.760
his mask with a circle to the staff’s mask to&nbsp;
disguise him as a high-ranking staff member. 
&nbsp;

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:31.840
After the game, the players are brought back to&nbsp;
their room. However, the staff take player number&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:36.960
111 with them. It is revealed that some of the&nbsp;
staff is secretly harvesting the players’ organs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:41.520
to sell them. Number 111 is a surgeon who is&nbsp;
helping them. In return, they tell the man&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:46.080
what each game is going to be so he would pass&nbsp;
them all, and they can continue their secret&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:52.560
mission. Meanwhile, Deoksu takes Minyeo to his&nbsp;
team for helping him earlier. Out of 187 players&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:57.840
who participated, 79 were killed. The following&nbsp;
morning, they are given breakfast of an egg and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:03.040
a cold drink. Deoksu complains about it not being&nbsp;
enough. He and his team get into the line twice&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:07.440
to get more food. Because of this, a few&nbsp;
people who were at the end do not get any. A&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:12.560
woman reveals that she saw the group take the food&nbsp;
twice. This enrages a man who didn’t get the food.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:17.280
He yells at Deoksu to give him his share back&nbsp;
and tries to snatch the cold drink from him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:22.800
An angered Deoksu hits him, and the two get into&nbsp;
a fight. Deoksu beats the man repeatedly, to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:28.000
point he lies limp on the ground. When everything&nbsp;
goes silent, Sangwoo comes to check on the man,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.400
only to find him dead. Gi-hun asks the staff to&nbsp;
do something and even looks at the surveillance&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:36.960
camera to ask the overseer. However, the&nbsp;
staff do not intervene whatsoever and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:42.480
announce that player number 271 is eliminated. 
Everyone realises that killing each other is fair&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:47.440
in the game. This gives Deoksu’s group an idea.&nbsp;
They can just kill everyone and win the money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:52.720
for themselves. Some staff members arrive with&nbsp;
a coffin and take the dead body away. Meanwhile,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:57.440
the doctor is still harvesting the organs. After&nbsp;
he is done, the staff ask him to stick to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:02.000
strongest team. They reveal that the management&nbsp;
deliberately supplied less food for breakfast&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.920
because they want the players to go wild&nbsp;
and do anything they can for the money,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:10.880
even kill each other. At last, they tell him about&nbsp;
the next game and make him leave. Back in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:15.600
hall, everyone is scared for their life. Gi-hun&nbsp;
and the team decide to stay awake all night to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:21.040
safe. Seeing Saebyeok alone, Gi-hun invites her&nbsp;
to their group, but she doesn’t trust them. 
&nbsp;

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:25.280
When the doctor returns to the hall, he looks&nbsp;
around for the strongest team. Taking the staff’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:30.800
advice, he approaches Deoksu’s team and asks them&nbsp;
to take him in. Deoksu makes fun of him at first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:35.760
but accepts once he secretly tells him what game&nbsp;
will be played the following day. The staff is put&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:40.320
on high alert for the “special game”, referring to&nbsp;
the fight that will occur when the lights go out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:45.280
As soon as the lights are off, Deoksu’s team gets&nbsp;
up and starts attacking people. Deoksu makes the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:49.840
first kill, and the screams wake everyone up. The&nbsp;
overseer watches everyone through the surveillance&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:54.000
camera’s night vision. He orders one staff member&nbsp;
to flicker the lights in the room, so the killings&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.520
are seen clearer. Soon, the bunk beds start&nbsp;
falling, and the place turns into a bloodbath. 
&nbsp;

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:04.080
Deoksu attacks Saebyeok and is about to strangle&nbsp;
her to death, but she is saved when another&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:09.120
guy attacks him. Gi-hun’s group meets each other&nbsp;
amidst the chaos, but the old man Ilnam is nowhere&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:14.240
to be seen. Saebyeok joins Gi-hun’s team for her&nbsp;
safety, but the group is attacked by Deoksu’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:18.880
group again. As they fight, they hear Ilnam&nbsp;
asking everyone to stop from the highest bed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:23.680
The overseer sees this and turns the lights on.&nbsp;
The staff walk into the place covered in blood&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:28.400
and dead bodies. They scan the dead bodies, and an&nbsp;
announcement is made saying that twenty-seven of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:32.720
them have been eliminated. The dead bodies&nbsp;
are taken out and burned in the furnace.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:37.360
After everything calms down, Gi-hun and the group&nbsp;
gather and introduce themselves to each other,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:39.920
as they have been calling each&nbsp;
other by numbers till now. 
&nbsp;

00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:44.880
Ilnam seems to be shaken up by the incident and&nbsp;
forgets his own name. Gi-hun assures him he will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:50.400
be fine once he takes rest. Meanwhile, the doctor&nbsp;
dresses Deoksu’s injuries. The group is happy to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:54.800
have killed so many people and decide to kill&nbsp;
more until they are the only ones left so that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:59.600
they can take the prize money. Minyeo sees that&nbsp;
Deoksu is favouring the doctor more than her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:04.320
To be closer to him, she seductively invites him&nbsp;
to the washroom, where the two have intercourse&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:09.040
inside a stall. The following morning, everyone&nbsp;
is woken up and told that the third game will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:13.440
start momentarily. After a while, they are&nbsp;
taken to an empty white room where they are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:18.720
told to separate into a group of ten people&nbsp;
each. Gi-hun’s team already has five members,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:23.280
so they decide to find one person each.&nbsp;
Deoksu, who already knows what the game is,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:28.480
asks his men to gather some more well-built men.&nbsp;
Minyeo is at a loss for words when he tells her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:33.600
she cannot be in the team. She begs him to let&nbsp;
her in, only to be pushed to the ground.
&nbsp;

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:37.920
Meanwhile, Saebyeok approaches a girl who is&nbsp;
sitting alone in a corner. She agrees to be in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:43.440
their team. The others bring one man each except&nbsp;
for Ilnam. So, the group only has nine members.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:47.440
Minyeo, who had been kicked out of Deoksu’s&nbsp;
group, joins them at the last moment.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:51.120
They are then brought to a massive hall&nbsp;
that has a tall bridge in the front.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:55.920
The third game turns out to be the tug of war. The&nbsp;
players are supposed to pull a rope to their side,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:55.920 --> 00:10:01.120
and the ones who lose will fall off the tall&nbsp;
bridge and die. Gi-hun’s team has two girls and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:06.000
an old man, so the chance of them winning is low.&nbsp;
But Deoksu has already gathered the strongest men&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.400
of the crowd. Their group goes against another&nbsp;
group. The others watch in nervousness as the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:15.840
first match starts. Deoksu’s team wins it almost&nbsp;
instantly, and the other group hangs onto the rope&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:20.720
to eventually fall to the ground below. At&nbsp;
last, the staff take their bodies away. 
&nbsp;

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:25.200
The next is Gi-hun’s team. They nervously&nbsp;
get up, knowing that their stakes are low.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:30.320
Moreover, their opponents are all men who seem to&nbsp;
be particularly strong. However, Ilnam claims that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:35.280
he used to be the best at the tug of war when he&nbsp;
was a kid. He briefs them on some basic techniques&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:39.680
of the game. First, the one on the front has&nbsp;
to be a strong person who can communicate with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:45.040
the others by tilting his head to the sides, and&nbsp;
the last one has to be the strongest. Second, one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:49.840
player should be at each side of the rope, so the&nbsp;
pull is stronger. Third, all their feet should be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:54.480
facing forward and they should hold onto the rope&nbsp;
with their armpits as well. The last and the most&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:58.960
important thing is that the team should hold their&nbsp;
ground for the first ten seconds after the game&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:03.440
starts. That way, you can take the opponent by&nbsp;
surprise when their rhythm starts to break. 
&nbsp;

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:08.160
Using these techniques, the group is almost about&nbsp;
to win, but the opponents pull the rope harder at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:12.240
the last moment. They are almost pulled to the&nbsp;
edge when Sangwoo comes up with a last-minute&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:16.560
plan. He asks everyone to loosen their hold&nbsp;
for some seconds so the opponents would lose&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:20.720
their balance. The episode ends as they let&nbsp;
go of the rope in the count of three.
