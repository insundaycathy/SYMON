which<00:06:39.600><c> would</c><00:06:39.840><c> be</c><00:06:40.000><c> max</c><00:06:40.319><c> if</c><00:06:40.479><c> this</c><00:06:40.639><c> theory</c><00:06:40.960><c> is</c>

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:41.120 align:start position:0%
which would be max if this theory is

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:43.270 align:start position:0%

then that would of course lead to the

then that would of course lead to the

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.749 align:start position:0%
with things reversing
so<00:07:15.919><c> if</c><00:07:16.080><c> we</c><00:07:16.240><c> take</c><00:07:16.560><c> those</c><00:07:16.880><c> letters</c><00:07:17.199><c> and</c><00:07:17.280><c> reverse</c>

00:07:17.749 --> 00:07:17.759 align:start position:0%
so if we take those letters and reverse
 

00:07:17.759 --> 00:07:20.070 align:start position:0%
so if we take those letters and reverse
them<00:07:18.319><c> we</c><00:07:18.479><c> then</c><00:07:18.720><c> get</c><00:07:18.960><c> the</c><00:07:19.039><c> name</c><00:07:19.360><c> neil</c>

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:20.080 align:start position:0%
them we then get the name neil
 

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:22.710 align:start position:0%
