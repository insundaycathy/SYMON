00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:03.520
Hey everyone...

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.459
Welcome back to Movie Recap.

00:00:05.459 --> 00:00:07.509
Today I'm gonna show you a movie called,

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:08.986
The Invisible Man.

00:00:08.986 --> 00:00:11.960
It is a 2020&nbsp;American science fiction horror film

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.230
written and directed by Leigh Whannell and starring Elisabeth Moss.

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.598
The movie is about a woman who&nbsp;believes she is being stalked

00:00:18.598 --> 00:00:21.174
and gaslit by her abusive and wealthy&nbsp;husband,

00:00:21.174 --> 00:00:24.253
even after his apparent suicide and ultimately deduces

00:00:24.253 --> 00:00:27.037
that he has&nbsp;acquired the ability to become invisible.

00:00:27.037 --> 00:00:28.715
Let s start!

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.960
Trapped in an abusive relationship with her fiendish and violent husband,

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.376
an optics scientist named Adrian Griffin,

00:00:45.376 --> 00:00:48.086
Cecilia&nbsp;Kass escapes from him in the dead of night

00:00:48.086 --> 00:00:49.848
with the help of her sister Emily.

00:00:49.848 --> 00:00:53.550
Cecilia has drugged&nbsp;Adrian with Diazepam but as she escapes,

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.761
Cecilia frees their dog which sets off the car's alarm

00:00:56.761 --> 00:00:59.852
and&nbsp;wakes up a furious Adrian who pursues her.

00:00:59.852 --> 00:01:01.366
As she escapes with Emily,

00:01:01.366 --> 00:01:05.776
Cecilia leaves the drug bottle&nbsp;behind which Adrian finds lying in the road.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:09.608
Two weeks later,

00:01:09.608 --> 00:01:12.799
Cecilia lives in hiding&nbsp;at the household of her best friend,

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:15.739
James Lanier and his teenage daughter, Sydney.

00:01:15.739 --> 00:01:18.556
Remaining a recluse who is afraid of leaving the house,

00:01:18.556 --> 00:01:21.175
Cecilia freaks out when Emily comes to&nbsp;visit,

00:01:21.175 --> 00:01:23.381
believing Adrian will try to harm her.

00:01:23.381 --> 00:01:27.578
However, Emily shares the news that Adrian committed suicide.

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.754
His brother Tom bequeaths to Cecilia his late brother's fortune

00:01:32.754 --> 00:01:34.749
and estate&nbsp;which Cecilia only accepts

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:37.840
to fund Sydney's college tuition and James' household.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.952
However,&nbsp;Cecilia is filled with an uneasy feeling

00:01:40.952 --> 00:01:43.644
that she is being watched and in the night,

00:01:43.644 --> 00:01:47.389
is stalked&nbsp;by an unseen force which only she recognizes.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:51.370
In the middle of the night,

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:53.121
while asleep next&nbsp;to Sydney,

00:01:53.121 --> 00:01:57.318
the comforter is slowly pulled off and several flashes of light are seen.

00:01:57.318 --> 00:02:00.499
Cecilia&nbsp;wakes up and is suspicious about the blankets

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:01.769
at the foot of the bed.

00:02:01.769 --> 00:02:04.718
When she tries to take&nbsp;them back, they won't move.

00:02:04.718 --> 00:02:07.133
Her reaction wakes up both Sydney and James

00:02:07.133 --> 00:02:10.757
but she's unable&nbsp;to explain what she thinks she'd seen.

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.920
Cecilia goes to a job interview for an architect's position.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.534
When she opens her portfolio to show her&nbsp;work,

00:02:20.534 --> 00:02:22.785
Cecilia finds it gone and faints.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.742
After going to the hospital,

00:02:26.742 --> 00:02:29.074
Cecilia&nbsp;discovers that she was drugged.

00:02:29.074 --> 00:02:31.817
Upon returning home she receives a call&nbsp;from the doctor

00:02:31.817 --> 00:02:34.279
telling her she had enough Diazepam in her system

00:02:34.279 --> 00:02:37.728
to constitute a mild&nbsp;overdose that caused her fainting spell.

00:02:37.728 --> 00:02:41.644
She suddenly finds the bottle of Diazepam Adrian had uncovered.

00:02:43.124 --> 00:02:43.972
Feeling unsafe,

00:02:43.972 --> 00:02:47.718
Cecilia visits Emily who is angry and despondent to her,

00:02:47.718 --> 00:02:50.838
having&nbsp;received a hateful email from Cecilia's account.

00:02:50.838 --> 00:02:52.426
Cecilia looks on her email,

00:02:52.426 --> 00:02:56.197
discovers the&nbsp;sent message and has an emotional breakdown.

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.624
Sydney tries to cheer her up

00:03:00.624 --> 00:03:02.891
but is assaulted by&nbsp;an unseen force,

00:03:02.891 --> 00:03:06.272
causing Sydney to freak out and believe Cecilia did it.

00:03:06.272 --> 00:03:10.215
James then decides to&nbsp;take Sydney out of the house to a safer place.

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:12.640
Meanwhile,

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.220
Cecilia investigates the house and finds her work

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.568
in the attic crawl space as well as&nbsp;a large kitchen knife of James'

00:03:18.568 --> 00:03:22.995
and several photos of her asleep which&nbsp;have been taken by an unseen stalker.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.067
Realizing she is not alone,

00:03:26.067 --> 00:03:28.682
Cecilia&nbsp;dumps a bucket of paint on the ladder

00:03:28.682 --> 00:03:32.769
when she senses movement and uncovers a&nbsp;man's shape wearing some kind of suit.

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:37.405
The man flees and washes off the&nbsp;paint before Cecilia exits the attic.

00:03:37.405 --> 00:03:41.671
The two fight until Cecilia breaks free&nbsp;from his grasp and escapes the house,

00:03:41.671 --> 00:03:43.695
getting into a Lyft car she has called.

00:03:43.695 --> 00:03:46.808
Cecilia has the driver bring her to Adrian's.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.563
Upon entering her husband's house and sneaking&nbsp;into his laboratory,

00:03:52.563 --> 00:03:56.896
Cecilia discovers a high-tech suit he was working on that could make him&nbsp;invisible.

00:03:56.896 --> 00:04:01.177
Cecilia takes this suit and hides it but is attacked by the Invisible Man 

00:04:01.177 --> 00:04:04.794
until her dog&nbsp;returns and intervenes, buying her time to escape.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.218
Cecilia sets up a meeting with Emily at a&nbsp;restaurant

00:04:10.218 --> 00:04:13.787
and apologizes while also explaining that she loves her.

00:04:13.787 --> 00:04:16.610
Emily's skepticism starts to&nbsp;melt as they begin to

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:20.977
bond and Cecilia explains that she found an invisible suit at Adrian's&nbsp;lab.

00:04:20.977 --> 00:04:25.242
Suddenly, a large knife is dragged across Emily's throat killing her.

00:04:25.242 --> 00:04:27.496
The knife is placed&nbsp;in Cecilia's hand,

00:04:27.496 --> 00:04:30.168
who is then arrested and moved to a sanitarium.

00:04:31.161 --> 00:04:33.399
Now doubting her own sanity and&nbsp;finding out

00:04:33.399 --> 00:04:35.422
she is pregnant with Adrian's child,

00:04:35.422 --> 00:04:38.389
Cecilia gives in but is then confronted by Tom

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:41.356
who&nbsp;explains he was working with his brother the whole time.

00:04:41.356 --> 00:04:43.466
Tom says that she will lose the fortune

00:04:43.466 --> 00:04:45.766
and be admitted permanently to this institution

00:04:45.766 --> 00:04:48.531
unless she returns to Adrian with his child.

00:04:48.531 --> 00:04:52.111
Cecilia refuses, still enraged that he killed her sister.

00:04:52.111 --> 00:04:55.840
Tom leaves but&nbsp;not before Cecilia steals one of his pens.

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.007
In her room,

00:04:58.007 --> 00:04:59.940
Cecilia prepares to kill herself

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:04.129
by&nbsp;slashing her wrist with the pen but the invisible man stops her.

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:07.274
Having pulled him out of hiding&nbsp;by using herself as bait,

00:05:07.274 --> 00:05:09.463
Cecilia stabs him with the pen twice,

00:05:09.463 --> 00:05:13.691
causing his suit to glitch&nbsp;and for him to appear and disappear at random.

00:05:13.691 --> 00:05:15.903
A security guard enters to stop her

00:05:15.903 --> 00:05:18.823
but is stunned&nbsp;by the glitching figure who beats him down.

00:05:18.823 --> 00:05:20.989
Cecilia rushes out into the hall

00:05:20.989 --> 00:05:24.961
and is stopped by&nbsp;several security guards who also see the glitching figure.

00:05:24.961 --> 00:05:30.065
The Invisible Man easily overpowers them&nbsp;before escaping into the stormy night.

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:35.474
Cecilia tracks him down but he overpowers her

00:05:35.474 --> 00:05:38.454
and tells&nbsp;her that he will now set his sights on Sydney.

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.811
Cecilia warns James of the danger

00:05:41.811 --> 00:05:45.660
and he&nbsp;rushes home to see an unseen figure attacking his daughter.

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:50.359
James tries to intervene but is&nbsp;beaten horribly in front of a terrified Sydney.

00:05:50.359 --> 00:05:54.111
Cecilia breaks in and sprays the&nbsp;figure with a fire extinguisher,

00:05:54.111 --> 00:05:58.116
revealing his shape before unloading on him&nbsp;with a fallen officer's pistol.

00:05:58.116 --> 00:06:01.930
The Invisible Man falls to the floor and dies of his wounds.

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:04.143
Cecilia unmasks The Invisible Man,

00:06:04.143 --> 00:06:05.752
revealing him to be Tom.

00:06:05.752 --> 00:06:08.436
Adrian is found tied and walled up&nbsp;in his house

00:06:08.436 --> 00:06:10.584
when a SWAT team storms his place.

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:14.053
James explains that the evidence suggests

00:06:14.053 --> 00:06:16.501
that Tom used his brother to get at Cecilia

00:06:16.501 --> 00:06:19.941
but she is still convinced that Adrian&nbsp;and Tom were working together

00:06:19.941 --> 00:06:21.786
and that in case the worst happened,

00:06:21.786 --> 00:06:24.544
Adrian set&nbsp;it up that Tom would take the fall.

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:28.450
Still stressed from the series of events,

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:31.790
Cecilia&nbsp;calls Adrian and agrees to meet him for dinner.

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:35.250
Cecilia is wearing a listening device hoping&nbsp;to find a way

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:37.841
to get a confession out of him with the help of James,

00:06:37.841 --> 00:06:40.106
who is positioned outside&nbsp;the property.

00:06:40.106 --> 00:06:42.630
Cecilia asks him if he was stalking her

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:45.828
but Adrian denies it at first but later&nbsp;implies

00:06:45.828 --> 00:06:47.711
that he was indeed preying upon her.

00:06:47.711 --> 00:06:50.359
As Cecilia excuses herself to the bathroom,

00:06:50.359 --> 00:06:52.508
Adrian begins to realize something else

00:06:52.508 --> 00:06:56.350
is up when suddenly his head is jerked back and his&nbsp;throat is slashed.

00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:59.479
Adrian collapses to the ground, bleeding to death.

00:06:59.479 --> 00:07:03.866
Cecilia enters the room&nbsp;and appears shocked before calling the police,

00:07:03.866 --> 00:07:06.796
reporting an apparent suicide in a panicky tone.

00:07:06.796 --> 00:07:09.715
Cecilia then gloats over Adrian's dying body

00:07:09.715 --> 00:07:12.910
and implies that she did this using his invisible&nbsp;suit.

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:15.466
James rushes in and finds Cecilia escaping

00:07:15.466 --> 00:07:17.224
with Adrian's suit and dog.

00:07:17.224 --> 00:07:20.628
Upon discovering that&nbsp;she set this up with the plan of murdering him,

00:07:20.628 --> 00:07:22.343
James lets her go nonetheless.

00:07:22.343 --> 00:07:24.357
Cecilia leaves into the night,

00:07:24.357 --> 00:07:29.049
perhaps with the plan of stealing her&nbsp;husband's work for her own future benefit.

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:32.018
Thanks for watching... 

00:07:32.018 --> 00:07:34.066
