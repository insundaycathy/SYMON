NANCY STRUGGLES TO ESCAPE AND SWIMS TO A ROCK

00:02:22.411 --> 00:02:24.447

NANCY TRIES TO EAT A TINY CRAWLING CREATURE,

00:03:03.605 --> 00:03:06.550
BUT SHE QUICKLY BARFS IT UP...

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:13.034
NANCY GETS COLDER AS THE NIGHT FALLS.

00:03:13.034 --> 00:03:16.397
SHE PUTS HER SUIT BACK ON TO KEEP WARM.

00:03:16.397 --> 00:03:18.627
SHE ALSO LOOSENS THE TOURNIQUET

00:03:18.627 --> 00:03:21.117
TO ALLOW BLOOD FLOW IN THE LEG.

00:03:21.888 --> 00:03:25.840
ON THE SHORE, SHE SEES A DRUNK MAN PASSED OUT IN THE SAND...

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.763
SHE CALLS OUT TO HIM

00:03:27.763 --> 00:03:30.118
AND MANAGES TO GET HIS ATTENTION.

00:03:30.118 --> 00:03:33.585
NANCY POINTS TOWARD HER BAG FOR HER TO CALL FOR HELP.

00:03:33.585 --> 00:03:37.016
THE MAN JUST STEALS HER PHONE AND WALLET.

00:03:39.423 --> 00:03:42.245
HE SEES HER BOARD FLOATING IN THE SHALLOWS,

00:03:42.245 --> 00:03:44.727
AND HE WALKS INTO THE WATER TO GET IT...

00:03:44.727 --> 00:03:47.863
NANCY YELLS TO HIM TO GET AWAY FROM THE SHARK.

00:03:47.863 --> 00:03:50.437
SHE THEN SEES THE SHARK ATTACK THE MAN

00:03:50.437 --> 00:03:52.362
AS HE HEADS BACK TO THE SHORE.

00:03:52.362 --> 00:03:54.769
THE SHARK TEARS THE MAN IN HALF,

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:58.660
AND THE TOP HALF TRIES CRAWLING AWAY UNTIL HE DIES...

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.849
IN THE MORNING,

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:03.718
THE OTHER TWO SURFERS RETURN TO THE OCEAN.

00:04:03.718 --> 00:04:06.089
NANCY CALLS TO THEM AS THEY RIDE

00:04:06.089 --> 00:04:07.768
THEIR BOARDS INTO THE WATER.

00:04:07.768 --> 00:04:10.046
SHE WARNS THEM ABOUT THE SHARK,

00:04:10.046 --> 00:04:13.114
BUT ONE SURFER ASSURES HER THERE ISN'T ONE.

00:04:13.114 --> 00:04:15.713
HE'S PROVEN WRONG WHEN THE SHARK JUMPS UP

00:04:15.713 --> 00:04:17.154
AND TAKES EATS HIM.

00:04:18.818 --> 00:04:21.288
THE OTHER SURFER RUSHES TOWARD THE ROCK,

00:04:21.288 --> 00:04:23.563
BUT THE SHARK PULLS HIM DOWN.

00:04:23.563 --> 00:04:26.128
HE RESURFACES QUICKLY BY THE ROCK

00:04:26.128 --> 00:04:28.515
WHERE NANCY TRIES TO PULL HIM UP...

00:04:28.515 --> 00:04:30.516
THE SHARK PULLS HIM DOWN

00:04:30.516 --> 00:04:33.817
LEAVING ONLY HIS HELMET WITH A CAMERA ON TOP,

00:04:33.817 --> 00:04:36.185
WHICH CAPTURES HIM GETTING EATEN...

00:04:38.769 --> 00:04:41.903
NANCY POPS THE SEAGULL'S WING BACK INTO PLACE

00:04:41.903 --> 00:04:46.075
AND THEN LETS IT FLOAT AWAY ON A BROKEN PIECE OF SURFBOARD...

00:04:47.226 --> 00:04:48.743
ON THE NEXT SCENE,

00:04:48.743 --> 00:04:51.079
NANCY OBSERVES THE SHARK'S MOVEMENTS

00:04:51.079 --> 00:04:52.671
AS IT CIRCLES THE ROCK,

00:04:52.671 --> 00:04:55.740
ESTIMATING THAT IT SWIMS ABOUT 32 SECONDS

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.423
AROUND ANOTHER ROCK,

00:04:57.423 --> 00:05:01.071
WHICH LEAVES HER WITH TIME TO SWIM AND REACH THE HELMET.

00:05:01.071 --> 00:05:04.618
SHE TAKES THAT CHANCE AND MAKES IT TO THE LITTLE ROCK,

00:05:04.618 --> 00:05:08.244
BUT SHE MISSES THE HELMET BEFORE THE SHARK RETURNS...

00:05:08.244 --> 00:05:10.788
AS SHE GOES BACK TO THE BIGGER ROCK,

00:05:10.788 --> 00:05:12.703
SHE SEES THE HELMET AGAIN.

00:05:12.703 --> 00:05:16.507
NANCY REACHES FOR IT AS THE SHARK LUNGES TOWARD HER.

00:05:16.507 --> 00:05:20.221
THE SHARK HURTS ITSELF AS IT SCRAPES AGAINST THE CORAL.

00:05:20.221 --> 00:05:23.034
NANCY MANAGES TO GET THE HELMET...

00:05:24.475 --> 00:05:27.915
SHE MAKES A VIDEO FOR ANYONE THAT FINDS THE HELMET.

00:05:27.915 --> 00:05:30.767
SHE SHOWS HOW BAD HER LEG HAS GOTTEN,

00:05:30.767 --> 00:05:32.537
WITH GANGRENE SETTING IN,

00:05:32.537 --> 00:05:35.700
AND SHE LEAVES A MESSAGE FOR CHLOE AND THEIR FATHER.

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:39.553
NANCY THEN TOSSES THE HELMET TOWARD THE SHORE.

00:05:41.217 --> 00:05:44.255
NANCY SEES A BUOY SEVERAL FEET AWAY.

00:05:44.255 --> 00:05:46.428
SHE MAKES HER PLAN TO REACH IT

00:05:46.428 --> 00:05:49.016
AND TRY TO BRING ATTENTION TO HERSELF.

00:05:49.016 --> 00:05:52.831
AS SHE PREPARES HERSELF, THE SHARK SWIMS TOWARD HER.

00:05:52.831 --> 00:05:55.416
A SCHOOL OF JELLYFISH RISES UP...

00:05:55.416 --> 00:05:58.235
NANCY THINKS THE SHARK CAN'T HARM HER

00:05:58.235 --> 00:06:00.803
IF IT RUNS INTO SOMETHING THAT CAN HURT IT.

00:06:00.803 --> 00:06:04.550
NANCY JUMPS INTO THE WATER AND SWIMS TOWARD THE BUOY,

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:06.668
AND THE SHARK FOLLOWS CLOSELY.

00:06:06.668 --> 00:06:09.000
SHE GETS STUNG ON HER SHOULDER,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.116
WHILE THE SHARK EATS SOME JELLYFISH AND GETS STUNG TOO...

00:06:14.867 --> 00:06:18.096
NANCY REACHES THE BUOY AND FINDS A FLARE GUN.

00:06:18.096 --> 00:06:21.567
SHE GRABS THE SHOTS AND FIRES A FEW IN THE AIR

00:06:21.567 --> 00:06:23.780
AS SHE SPOTS A BOAT IN THE DISTANCE.

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:27.360
UNFORTUNATELY THE BOAT IS ALREADY TURNED AWAY,

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:28.970
AND IT NEVER SEES HER.

00:06:29.434 --> 00:06:32.057
THE SHARK STARTS TO CIRCLE THE BUOY.

00:06:32.057 --> 00:06:35.423
NANCY FIRES A FLARE DIRECTLY AT THE SHARK.

00:06:35.423 --> 00:06:39.749
NOW PISSED OFF, THE SHARK STARTS SLAMMING INTO THE BUOY,

00:06:39.749 --> 00:06:42.450
BREAKING THE CHAINS THAT KEEP IT UP,

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:46.682
IT MANAGES TO LOOSEN THE BUOY AND STARTS CHOMPING INTO IT,

00:06:46.682 --> 00:06:49.856
NANCY STRUGGLES TO KEEP HERSELF AT A DISTANCE

00:06:49.856 --> 00:06:52.131
AND TO HOLD ON TO THE BUOY.

00:06:52.131 --> 00:06:53.146
WHILE UNDERWATER,

00:06:53.146 --> 00:06:55.849
SHE NOTICES THE CHAIN HOLDING THE BUOY TO

00:06:55.849 --> 00:06:58.318
A SPIKED BASE ON THE FLOOR OF THE BAY.

00:06:58.318 --> 00:06:59.889
AT THE RIGHT MOMENT,

00:06:59.889 --> 00:07:03.553
NANCY GETS THE CHAIN ON A HOOK STUCK IN THE SHARK'S SIDE.

00:07:03.553 --> 00:07:06.145
THIS PULLS HER DOWN TOWARD THE BASE AS

00:07:06.145 --> 00:07:07.750
THE SHARK CHASES HER.

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:10.008
SHE PULLS OUT AT THE RIGHT MOMENT,

00:07:10.008 --> 00:07:13.194
CAUSING THE SHARK TO SWIM DIRECTLY ONTO THE BASE

00:07:13.194 --> 00:07:15.000
AND IT GETS IMPALED...

00:07:16.467 --> 00:07:17.457
ON THE SHORE,

00:07:17.457 --> 00:07:20.388
A LITTLE BOY FINDS THE HELMET CAMERA

00:07:20.388 --> 00:07:22.436
AND SEES NANCY'S VIDEO.

00:07:22.436 --> 00:07:25.740
HE RUNS TO GET HIS FATHER WHO IS CARLOS...

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:30.546
THE TWO FIND NANCY WASHED UP ON THE SHORE DEHYDRATED AND WEAK...

00:07:30.546 --> 00:07:32.649
THEY RUN TO HELP HER.

00:07:32.649 --> 00:07:36.021
NANCY SEES THE SEAGULL STANDING CLOSE TO HER...

00:07:36.021 --> 00:07:37.882
BEFORE SHE PASSES OUT,

00:07:37.882 --> 00:07:41.349
NANCY SEES A VISION OF HER MOTHER SMILING DOWN ON HER.

00:07:41.349 --> 00:07:44.406
NANCY SIMPLY SAYS, "I'M OKAY."

00:07:44.406 --> 00:07:47.498
ONE YEAR LATER, NANCY IS DOING BETTER,

00:07:47.498 --> 00:07:50.046
ALBEIT WITH A BIG SCAR ON HER LEG...

00:07:50.046 --> 00:07:53.936
SHE RETURNS TO THE BEACH WITH CHLOE AND THEIR FATHER.

00:07:55.244 --> 00:07:57.428
NANCY BRINGS CHLOE INTO THE WATER

00:07:57.428 --> 00:08:00.547
TO TEACH HER HOW TO SURF...

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:03.517
