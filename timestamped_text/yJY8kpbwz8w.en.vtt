there was no girl at the scene and then he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.240
slowly reveals to her that her husband doug is&nbsp;
dead and miranda has been accused of his murder&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.040
she breaks down and pete pins her down on the&nbsp;
bed while the nurses try to sedate her again&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.120
the next morning miranda finds herself in the&nbsp;
penitentiary's cafeteria surrounded by her former&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:00.880

the front page article confirming her worst fears&nbsp;

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.520
breathe onto herself's glass door she jumps back&nbsp;
as the words not alone appear on the misti glass&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.360
unable to accept her new reality she huddles into&nbsp;
a corner and concludes that she must be dreaming&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.480
when miranda opens her eyes it's already morning&nbsp;
she's directed to the showers where she bathes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:28.080
with 20 other women she then hears chloe taunting&nbsp;
her she turns around and sees the girl she saw&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.200
on the road miranda is terrified but the girl&nbsp;
catches up to her and digs her nails into her arm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.880
the other patients frightened at her erratic&nbsp;
behavior run away leaving her bloody and alone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:44.000
on the tiled floor at the infirmary pete still&nbsp;
thinks of her to be deluded and checks her vitals&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.360
trying to make sense of things miranda gets pete&nbsp;
to admit his true romantic feelings for her but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.080
he insists that he's just trying to help her&nbsp;
miranda tries reaching out to another colleague&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:00.400
dr phil parsons but he's reluctant to help her&nbsp;
miranda is then taken to her lawyer teddy howard&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.080
teddy informs her that the evidence is so&nbsp;
overwhelming that they have no choice but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:09.920
to plead for temporary insanity sheriff bob ryan&nbsp;
doug's best friend joins their meeting but quickly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:15.200
loses his temper he accuses miranda and flashes&nbsp;
the gruesome crime scene pictures in front of her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.240
she trembles and notices that her cuts are&nbsp;
bleeding again she takes off the bandage and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:25.760
sees the words not alone etched into her skin&nbsp;
her eyes then go down towards the photos and see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.800
the same words painted in blood on their bedroom&nbsp;
door miranda has another breakdown and is quickly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:36.400
sedated by the medical staff pete takes her the&nbsp;
next morning to see dr parsons miranda tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.080
the two doctors that she was there when doug&nbsp;
was killed but insists that she wasn't alone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:46.400
as she tries to convince them she spots a framed&nbsp;
picture behind dr parsons miranda is shocked as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.960
she tells them that this was the girl she saw&nbsp;
that night dr parsons looks sad as he tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:55.440
miranda that it's impossible because the girl in&nbsp;
the picture was his daughter rachel who committed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.800
suicide four years ago as the night comes miranda&nbsp;
wakes up to the strong presence in her cell again&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.680
she calls out to the spirit and says that if&nbsp;
it is indeed the ghost of rachel parsons then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.400
it would let her out of the cell her cell door&nbsp;
opens and she escapes to the hallway where she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.360
sees the figure of a ghostly girl walking through&nbsp;
the wall miranda breaks into pete's office where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:20.640
his computer suddenly turns on to reveal a webpage&nbsp;
article of rachel parsons a surveillance cam then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:24.960
appears on the screen showing the girl standing&nbsp;
in the hallway of the solitary confinement section&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.560
thinking that chloe is in danger miranda runs&nbsp;
to her she arrives in solitary and hears a thump&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.680
from chloe's cell as she looks into the opening&nbsp;
chloe's bloody face is pushed against the glass&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.360
she tries to open the door but is stopped by a&nbsp;
man with a tattooed chest of the animasola she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:46.640
runs away and is tackled down by the medical staff&nbsp;
miranda meets pete the next day and asks about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:51.680
chloe she tells him about the man with the tattoo&nbsp;
and insists that rachel didn't commit suicide&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:56.080
pete dismisses her again as delusional&nbsp;
and warns her that if she acts up again&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:00.880
he'll be forced to throw her into solitary&nbsp;
miranda finds chloe later in the day in the yard&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:06.160
she apologizes to her for not believing her&nbsp;
stories earlier chloe accepts her apology&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.640
and gives her a hug but is still unable to&nbsp;
name the culprit she then warns miranda that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:15.600
the devil is targeting her next at the psych&nbsp;
ward miranda feels the haunting presence again&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:20.880
as she turns around in her cell the ghost rotting&nbsp;
face appears before her and smashes her into the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:26.480
wall miranda frantically searches for her attacker&nbsp;
but there's no escape the ghost throws her against&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:31.520
the other wall breaking the furniture it tosses&nbsp;
her back and forth against the two walls and then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:36.640
drops her down to the ground just in time for the&nbsp;
authorities to arrive as the officer checks on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:42.080
miranda she gets up and knocks him unconscious&nbsp;
she grabs the keys and escapes from the ward&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:47.120
the alarm blares and alerts the officers to search&nbsp;
for their missing patient miranda makes her way to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:52.320
an unused wing of the hospital and slips into&nbsp;
the pool and waits for the officers to leave&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:58.000
when she opens her eyes the ghost appears before&nbsp;
her she screams and runs away finding herself&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.680
under the desk of one of her officer friends joe&nbsp;
joe helps her escape by giving her his car keys&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.840
miranda takes off quickly in his car and is&nbsp;
shocked as she catches a glimpse of the ghost in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:12.640
her rear view mirror she's driving too fast and&nbsp;
sees the approaching truck at the intersection&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:17.520
but when she steps on the brakes it doesn't&nbsp;
budge terror rises up to miranda's throat as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:22.560
she slams her foot on the brakes her car narrowly&nbsp;
misses the truck and she lets out a deranged laugh&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:27.760
she crashes through the road signs and stops&nbsp;
just before she falls into the sinkhole&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:32.240
in a fit of anger she yells at the backseat&nbsp;
demanding the ghost what it wants from her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:37.600
the radio turns on giving her a hint miranda&nbsp;
arrives at the home she once shared with her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:42.720
husband just as the porch lights turn on as&nbsp;
she surveys the house she sees the dried blood&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:47.200
stains on the carpet the memories come rushing&nbsp;
back to her as she remembers carrying a bloody&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:52.240
axe and towering over her cowering husband but&nbsp;
the memories don't feel like they belong to her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:56.240
it felt like she was possessed she reaches&nbsp;
the bathroom and looks at the mirror&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:01.520
she watches as her own face contorts into an&nbsp;
unrecognizable figure and realizes that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:06.560
one who killed her husband was not her but the&nbsp;
vengeful ghost of rachel parsons miranda sobs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:11.440
in their bedroom cradling the picture she has&nbsp;
a duck the ghost gives her another sign telling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:17.040
her to go to willow creek as dawn breaks miranda&nbsp;
arrives at their country house she inspects the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:21.920
house but it's empty she enters the barn as&nbsp;
well but only finds broken and rusty farming&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:26.960
equipment as she's about to leave a glimpse&nbsp;
of a video camera box catches her attention&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:33.200
she then spots a secret entrance to the basement&nbsp;
downstairs miranda turns on the lights gasping in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:39.120
horror as she sees the bed chains boxes of drugs&nbsp;
and video equipment she plays back one of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:44.320
tapes and is petrified at her husband's secret&nbsp;
it turns out that doug was living a double life&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:50.720
kidnapping torturing raping and killing women she&nbsp;
hears footsteps upstairs and is about to escape&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:55.520
when a police officer catches her another woman&nbsp;
emerges from the depths of the basement grabbing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:55.520 --> 00:08:00.560
miranda with her bloody hands the woman turns&nbsp;
out to be doug's latest victim tracy sievers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:06.240
miranda is then brought in for questioning she&nbsp;
gets a chance to talk to dr parsons and tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:10.640
him about her experiences with rachel concluding&nbsp;
that rachel must have been one of doug's victims&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:16.560
she tries to relate the same theory with pete but&nbsp;
he dismisses her yet again as she spends the night&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:22.400
in her cell she demands to talk to sheriff ryan&nbsp;
but he is unavailable meanwhile pete digs up his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:28.320
own research about the animasola tattoo later that&nbsp;
same night sheriff ryan visits miranda in her cell&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:33.440
miranda tells him that the meaning of the phrase&nbsp;
not alone means that there are two killers and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:38.960
not just duck she shares her theory and comes up&nbsp;
with a psychological profile of the second killer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:44.720
as she speaks out the facts she realizes that the&nbsp;
profile perfectly matches sheriff ryan she then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:48.800
concludes that the only reason he was so willing&nbsp;
to talk to her was because he was trying to cover&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:53.920
up his own tracks sheriff ryan realizes that&nbsp;
miranda is on to him and smashes her against the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:59.600
wall she rips his shirt open revealing the anima&nbsp;
sola tattoo on his chest confirming that he was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:04.800
the man she saw in chloe's cell miranda manages&nbsp;
to escape his grasps and climbs up the stairs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:10.400
he fires consecutive shots at her one bullet&nbsp;
hitting open the gas pipe she reaches the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:15.360
locked doors and screams for help but he catches&nbsp;
up to her she hides under one of the desks as he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:20.560
gets his shotgun he's left at the end of his line&nbsp;
and starts his deranged monologue revealing the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:24.640
decades old killing secrets he shared with doug&nbsp;
and admitting the fact that they killed rachel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:29.920
parsons as he's about to flip over miranda's desk&nbsp;
a shadow catches his sight from the other side&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:35.280
he shoots and follows it he sees a woman standing&nbsp;
in front of him behind the glass believing it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:40.800
to be miranda but it's actually rachel he fires&nbsp;
another bullet breaking the glass and is shocked&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:46.720
to see rachel's corpse terrified he fires another&nbsp;
shot at her igniting the gas surrounding him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:52.320
he's pushed back by the explosion and is engulfed&nbsp;
in flames as he turns around to face miranda she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:56.960
aims a gun at him and takes the final shot&nbsp;
she runs to the door just in time to meet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:01.040
pete who looks relieved to see her alive and&nbsp;
apologizes to her for not believing her before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:06.720
a year passes and miranda's charges are dropped&nbsp;
she's walking the city streets with chloe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:11.280
who has also been released and they have become&nbsp;
good friends she helps her hail a taxi and they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:16.560
bid each other goodbye miranda walks the streets&nbsp;
alone and sees a boy in the middle of the street&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:21.760
she reaches out to him as he's about to be hit by&nbsp;
a vehicle but the apparition disappears miranda&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:26.720
