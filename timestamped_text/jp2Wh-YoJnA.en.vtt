very close and fall deeply in love. But a few days&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:30.320
later, Annabel dies due to a deadly disease, and&nbsp;
Humbert is deeply saddened by this. Many years&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.760
pass but Humbert did not have a relationship with&nbsp;
any girl after Annabel. Now Humbert is 50 years&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:42.000
old and he is a professor. Humbert also has to&nbsp;
write a book of his own, so he shifts to a small&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.760

Uncle's house has been completely destroyed and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:08.160
towards the chasing car, but He reverses the car&nbsp;
and runs away. Now Humbert comes to his car and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:14.480
asks Lolita for the number of the car which he&nbsp;
had asked to note down, but on the paper on which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:20.560

hotel. Humbert tells Lolita to stay at the hotel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:37.360
and goes out to get something himself. He comes&nbsp;
back and sees that Lolita's feet are dirty,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:43.600
and he understands that Lolita had gone out and&nbsp;
that he might be having an affair with someone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:49.600
else. Then both start traveling and once again&nbsp;
Lolita becomes very ill. Humbert admits Lolita&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:55.120
to the hospital. The next morning, Humbert calls&nbsp;
at the hospital to inquire about Lolita's health;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:01.040
the nurse tells her that Lolita has been taken&nbsp;
away by her uncle. Now Humbert becomes very tense&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:09.280
that the one who was following him may have left&nbsp;
with Lolita. He tries to find out who has taken&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:14.080
Lolita to the hospital but no one knows anything&nbsp;
about the man. He searches for Lolita everywhere,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:19.840
But 3 years pass by but Lolita is not found and&nbsp;
one day Humbert gets a letter from Lolita. In&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:25.280
this letter, Lolita tells that she is married&nbsp;
and pregnant and needs some money. Lolita's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:30.560
address is also written in that letter. Then&nbsp;
Humbert reaches out to Lolita. Arriving there,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:36.240
Humbert sees that Lolita is pregnant. He then asks&nbsp;
Lolita about her husband. Lolita shows her husband&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:41.200
to Humbert. Seeing him, Humbert understands that&nbsp;
it is not the man who was following him. Humbert&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:47.280
then asks Lolita who she had a fling with so&nbsp;
Lolita tells her that she had a fling with clare&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:52.800
and that she liked clare too. But clare was&nbsp;
sexually inactive and she wanted to make a porn&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:58.000
video of Lolita so Lolita ran away from her&nbsp;
and married a guy now Humbert says goodbye to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:04.160
Lolita and he goes to clare. Here he shoots Clare&nbsp;
and kills her. Now the police go after Humbert&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:09.120
and he surrenders himself to the police. Now&nbsp;
we are told that Humbert died in prison due&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:15.840
to an illness and Lolita also died while giving&nbsp;
birth to her child, which is how the movie ends.
