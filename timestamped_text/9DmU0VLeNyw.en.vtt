00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:11.639
Shalom everyone! Welcome to Cinema
Summary, ladies and gentlemen and may

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.309
peace be with you because
for a little Jewish village in

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.680
Lithuania peace will be irreversibly
disturbed now just so you know this

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.420
video will be split into two sections a
summary and an explanation if you

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.109
haven't seen the movie yet keep on going
for the summary if you have and you had

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.260
some questions about a few things go to
this time code on screen now for the

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.480
answers and with that out of the way
this is THE GOLEM

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:41.820
in the year 1673 in an isolated agrarian village
of  Lithuanian Orthodox Jews

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.640
We follow Hannah who we first see

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:49.230
is given a vial of contraceptives by
Perla the villagers healer, now the thing

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.850
is Hannah's a woman unlike any other in
the village for a few reasons for one

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.670
she has no child of her own as her son
Joseph died seven years ago and she

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.159
hasn't gotten over that and secondly
she's sneaky, clever, and curious: hiding

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.270
beneath the floors of the wooden yeshiva
where the men studied the Talmud with

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.950
the rabbi and because of this she's a
very intelligent woman who was able to

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.810
answer questions that not even the men
can answer including her husband

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.280
Benjamin, however the thing is with this
knowledge and curiosity comes a thirst

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.720
for the Kabbalah: forbidden, mystical
knowledge which Hannah learns if

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.150
harnessed correctly can allow one to
create life though Benjamin warns her

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.760
that such knowledge can drive even men
insane

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.460
who knows what it would do to a woman?

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.040
the next day is the wedding day of
Rebecca, Hannah's sister, and it's a

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:48.720
beautiful ceremony that is interrupted
by the arrival of Gentiles from a nearby

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.329
village. They are led by Vladimir who has
brought his sick plague-ridden daughter

00:01:54.329 --> 00:02:00.509
to the Jews who he believes caused his
people to get sick and after killing one

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:06.210
of them he forces them into a deal if
they heal his daughter his people will

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:12.810
leave him alone and won't kill them but
if anyone leaves the village before his

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.880
daughter is healed that person
will die, and with that said

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:23.200
he goes away taking Perla the with him to
heal his daughter. Later that day, the men

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.849
of the village plan for what is to be
done when Hannah comes and suggests that

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:32.530
they create a golem to protect the
village, an idea that the rabbi finds

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:38.049
preposterous and dangerous to do! So
Hanna takes matters into her own hands

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:42.489
after finding out her sister had a
miscarriage after getting punched at her

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:47.769
wedding, so she goes to the forest in the
middle of the night to create a golem

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:53.139
through a forbidden Kabbalic ritual
and the next morning she finds the

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:58.540
ritual site disturbed and is unsure if
the ritual failed but things become

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.340
strange as that night Hannah hears
something in the attic while Benjamin

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:09.240
sees his fiddle fall to the floor.
Upstairs, Hanna finds that a doll is

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:15.069
missing from a chest as well as a set of
wet footprints that walk away from the

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:20.620
chest and when Hanna comes downstairs
Benjamin has found something: a small

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:26.739
bottle of contraceptive that was hidden
underneath her bed. You see since their

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:32.290
son's death, Benjamin and Hannah have been
trying for a new boy and Benjamin has

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.599
just found out that Hanna has been
sabotaging their efforts to move on and

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:43.780
he angrily leaves Hannah alone as someone
watches them from inside the house the

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.009
following day, Hannah goes back to check
the ritual site but is ambushed by

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:52.150
Vladimir's men who lynch her but as
she's choking she watches them get

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.630
attacked by something and is cut down
from the tree to see her savior

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:59.680
It's the Golem!

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.480
she takes it back home keeping it in
the barm for the night while she reads

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:07.540
more about golems finding out two
particular details about them

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:13.479
number one: golems are meant to only
protect and safeguard for the greater

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:19.220
good of all and number two: golems can
evolve

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:22.780
so keep these two points of information
in mind as we go on throughout the film

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.820
as these points are crucial to the progression of the story

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.280
the motivations behind a specific character's actions

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:35.220
and the consequences therein, alright?
All right back to the movie

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.620
from here on the events of the
movie take place over a series of days

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:44.290
and things become dark for everyone
involved for one Hannah finds out that

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:49.420
the Golem not only feels her emotions
but that it will obey her will as we

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:54.130
find out it kills Hannah's neighbor after
Hanna gets jealous seeing her with

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:59.320
Benjamin. Secondly the Golem kills anyone
who seeks to destroy it as Benjamin

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:05.110
finds Perla's corpse hidden in a chest
after she tried to kill it and thirdly

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:10.270
after Vladimir's men are killed and he
is chased out of a village, Vladimir's

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:15.670
daughter dies and he takes revenge
against the village with his men who

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:21.040
kill, raid, and burn the Jewish village
and the villagers this ultimately leads

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:25.450
to Benjamin working with the rabbi and some
of the men in the village to destroy the

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:31.150
golem which goes terribly wrong
and ends in the golem going on a

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:36.850
murderous rampage killing any Jew or Gentile
with extreme prejudice before

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:42.460
its attack is ended by Hannah who having
realized the immense cost of her actions

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:48.610
and finally able to move past her son's
death, kills the golem by removing the

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:53.290
scroll from its mouth leaving her with
Benjamin as the few survivors of the

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:57.940
massacre and the movie ends with the
scroll the Hannah removed floating

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:04.260
gently to the feet of Abigail, the
daughter of Hannah's murdered neighbor

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:08.370
so you probably have questions about a
few things like why does Hannah's Golem

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:11.850
look like a human if it's been
established that golems look like giant

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:16.110
rock monsters and why does that same
golem go on a killing spree at the end

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:20.580
of the film killing both Gentiles and
Jews if it's supposed to protect them

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:25.880
for the greater good of all and finally
does Kabbalah truly drive people insane

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:30.720
well let's take a few steps back to
examine what's been established about

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:35.940
Kabbalah in the film which for those of
you who don't know is Jewish mysticism

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:41.010
which can be understood as the study of
the natural and the supernatural from a

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:45.990
Jewish perspective in context Benjamin
says that it can drive even men insane

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:50.730
while his father the village rabbi
remarks that only someone as legendary

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:53.910
as Moses could ever control such a
powerful thing

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:59.040
this along with a psychic bond that
Hannah has with the Golem I believe

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:02.520
answers your question you see the
Kabbalah is such a powerful force

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:06.180
that not even the great in Maharal
of Prague was able to successfully

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:11.490
control it as we see in the beginning of
the film. This inability to properly

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:16.020
control kabbalah leads to an otherwise
divine power being corrupted by human

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:20.760
desire and imperfection, Hannah is
established as having not gotten over

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:26.190
her son's death and she clearly uses the
golem child as a substitute for Joseph

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:32.430
and as an unhealthy coping mechanism to
deal with his death, in fact it's somewhat

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:36.660
implied that she was trying to find a
way to resurrect her son through the use

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:42.060
of the Kabbalah and in a way the ritual
she conducts does so although it takes

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:46.230
into account her desire for vengeance
against Vladimir in his men, her need to

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:51.020
protect her people, and of course her
son's resurrection or return so to speak

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:56.340
inadvertently creating a golem that's
unlike any before it: a golem that

00:07:56.340 --> 00:08:01.200
assumes a human shape as for why it goes
on a murderous rampage at the end of the

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:06.300
film I think that's in part due to the
bond that the golem has with Hannah it's

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:10.440
established in the movie that the Golem
feels whatever Hannah feels and we see

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:14.490
it very physically react with the same
anger they Hannah feels when she sees

00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:17.850
her neighbor with Benjamin and we
actually see the Golem

00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:22.680
itself experience its own jealousy when
it sees the attention that Hanna gives

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:27.960
Benjamin and it stabs itself in the
thigh to hurt Hanna now from what I've

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:31.830
read about golems in folklore and in
legend they are essentially machines

00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:36.720
they have no thoughts of their own and
they have no feelings of their own

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:41.010
however as established in the film
golems can evolve and they have a

00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:46.050
primary directive to protect for the
greater good of all and the way that I

00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:50.580
see ii is that through this psychic bond
the Golem molds itself to fulfill Hannah's

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:55.380
desire but also develops its own
emotions which corrupt its original

00:08:55.380 --> 00:09:00.180
purpose of protection so with this
glitch in its system its prime directive

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:04.920
of protecting the Jews is overwritten.
The Golem adapting and evolving to have

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:10.260
a different directive something akin to
"protect Hannah", "obey Hannah", "become like a

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:16.440
child for Hannah" and "protect itself"
leading to its childish jealousy and what

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:21.240
you could describe as the worst temper
tantrum ever. This evolution of function

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:26.610
in turn upgrades its capabilities which
would explain why the Golem is able to

00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:31.110
make people explode which is backed up
by the Golem of Prague having a similar

00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:36.540
ability. Now for question three does the
Kabbalah make people go insane that is a

00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:40.590
difficult question to answer as we only
have two case studies of people using

00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:45.510
Kabbalah in the film: Hannah and the
Maharal of Prague who we only briefly

00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:49.410
see and from what little we do see it
would be safe to assume that he was of

00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:52.530
right mind without delusion and he
didn't seem to exhibit any of the

00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:58.050
stereotypical symptoms of insanity
although from what I've read insanity is

00:09:58.050 --> 00:10:02.190
more or less a legal term rather than a
psychological one so take that for what

00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:04.770
it's worth now Hannah is a different
story

00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:09.480
Hannah is introduced into the movie as
having been traumatized, unable to move

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:13.110
on from her son's death and growing
obsessed with finding an answer as to

00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:19.110
why he died and how he could be brought
back this condition is a sign of

00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:22.410
complicated grief and pre-existing
mental disturbances or disorders

00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:27.930
although as the movie goes on Hannah
changes at first she's a bit

00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:31.440
manipulative, lying to Benjamin about her
use of contraceptive

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:35.460
and then this leads to her getting
jealous and dangerously possessive of

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:39.900
Benjamin as she finds out that her
neighbor is flirting with her man which

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:43.770
then leads to her sadistic glee after
finding out that Golem murdered her

00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:46.660
neighbor for her which although
incredibly disturbing

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:49.060
Does it mean that Hannah's crazy?

00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:52.460
Yes, well sort, of it's complicated you

00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:58.050
see it's never established what happens
when someone goes mad from Kabbalah so

00:10:58.050 --> 00:11:00.700
it's safe to assume that Hanna's actions
and reactions

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:05.520
are a consequence of Kabballic Madness
especially her acceptance, love, and

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:11.010
affection for the golem child although
by the end of the film she gets over this

00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:15.420
delusion that the golem child can serve as
a surrogate for Joseph, her dead son, and

00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:19.650
learns to move on from there so it's a
little bit ambiguous as to whether or

00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:23.990
not Kabbalic madness is a case-by-case
thing or if it's even real at all

00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:29.130
although you take it to consideration
the fact that magic Kabbalah especially

00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:33.900
in the film is real and that both diegetically, in the film, and nondiegetically, in real life,

00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:37.980
traditional kabbalah requires
specific people to study it.

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:40.140
Requirements such as being of the age of 40 and being male for example.

00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:45.000
it makes a lot of sense that the Kabbalic Madness is in fact a real thing

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.590
that the kebab madness is in fact a real
thing but it only affects specific people

00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:53.430
but what do you guys think do you
think Hannah's golem assumed a more human

00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:58.260
form due to their bond? Do you think
Kabbalah drives people insane let me

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:02.010
know, whether you agree or disagree with
me, with a comment down below and with that

00:12:02.010 --> 00:12:04.740
