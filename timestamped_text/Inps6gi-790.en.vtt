00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:17.230
With The Boys releasing on Amazon this week
I thought I’d check out the dark side of

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.980
superheroes to break down everything that
you need to know about Season One and it’s

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:22.980
ending.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.650
In the same month that Avengers Endgame surpassed
Avatar at the box office, The Boys deconstructs

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.390
the genre to show that depending on your point
of view every villain could be a hero and

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:33.970
every hero could be a villain.

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:38.500
Throughout this, I’ll be recapping the majority
of Season One as well as giving my thoughts

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.270
on the finale of the show and what it could
lead to.

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.720
There will be heavy spoilers here, so if you
haven’t had a chance to watch all of the

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.430
episodes yet and don’t want to know what
happens then I highly suggest that you turn

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:49.430
off now.

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.210
With that out the way I just wanna give a
huge thank you for clicking this video now

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:54.691
let’s get into my breakdown of The Boys.

00:00:54.691 --> 00:00:56.183
The Boys Season One Recap
________________

00:00:56.183 --> 00:01:00.340
Season One of the Boys takes on many perspectives
throughout its eight-episode run and the show

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:05.100
centres around a group of superheroes, known
as The Seven, that have pretty much-become

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.210
celebrities due to their powers and lifestyles.

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.720
Similar to our world heroes have infiltrated
every aspect of society and it’s difficult

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:13.880
to escape them.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.080
It showcases that worship without question
and for lack of a better term, fanboying,

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.970
grants people with more power than they should
have and means that they are no longer held

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:24.130
accountable by the law.

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:30.450
From the off this is a clear satire on both
Marvel, DC, The Kardashians, Harvey Weinstein

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.619
and there’s even several shots at Disney
and the corporations behind the heroes that

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.630
have pretty much turned them into commodities
to be bought and sold.

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.860
That doesn’t mean that the Superpowered
beings are innocent either and The Boys exposes

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.270
the dark side of those who possess great power
and it showcases that they don’t have all

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:47.330
that much responsibility.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.710
I guess absolute power corrupts absolutely
and we learn that they are all pretty much

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.819
sex-craved celebrities that use their positions
to abuse the law and silence anyone who stands

00:01:56.819 --> 00:01:57.819
up to them.

00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:02.130
This comes to a head when a regular dude named
Hughie sees his girlfriend killed in front

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.830
of him due to the blunder of a speedster named
A-Train who smashes right through her faster

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.929
than you should smash the like button on this
video.

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:10.520
Hughie And The Boys
________________

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.349
Due to his status, A-Train doesn’t really
face any real consequences and this sets off

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:18.610
Hughie on a reluctant quest for revenge to
take down the Superhumans with his ally Billy

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.910
Butcher played by Karl Urban.

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.989
Butcher has a vendetta against the Seven after
their leader had an affair with her and went

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:29.909
missing shortly after and he begins working
for the CIA who realise that if the Supes

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:34.540
are given military jurisdiction then it’ll
be worse than the CGI in Justice League.

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.100
This is very much a David Vs Goliath situation
and throughout Hughie constantly seems like

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.769
he’s in over his head as he rushes to take
down Vought, the corporation that has licensed

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:48.920
the heroes to movies, tv shows, games and
probably Funko pops.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.980
Everyone has a Funko pop these days right?

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:57.190
I want a Deffinition Funko Pop, if the queen
can get a Funko Pop I want a Deffinition Funko

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:58.190
Pop.

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.609
Anyway, the show is about choices and throughout
Hughie, similar to The Seven, is given the

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:06.780
option to do the right thing or give in to
his vices time and time again.

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:12.049
Luckily for viewers, Hughie always tends to
go with the red pill…or the blue pill…whatever

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:17.280
it was, the other pill, and this leads to
some entertaining takedowns of The Seven throughout

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.280
the season.

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.280

The Shining Example
________________

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.060
Mirroring this is Starlight a parody of Powergirl
who realises that The Seven aren’t the people

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.640
that she initially idolised and just because
people love a team up it doesn’t mean it’s

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:28.640
for the best.

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.420
After she is sexually harassed she becomes
cynical and similar to Hughie vows to take

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:33.849
Vought and Co Down.

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:38.810
This involves her going toe to toe with Madelyn
Stilwell, the shadowy CEO of Vought who is

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.069
the master manipulator of the entire season.

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:45.889
Starlight is very much an embodiment of The
MeToo movement and she cements that the only

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:49.680
way to rise up against oppression is to stand
against it.

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:55.060
She slowly picks apart the oppression in society
and how the nails that stick up are often

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:56.249
hammered down.

00:03:56.249 --> 00:04:00.770
She begins dating Hughie who uncovers the
truth behind the Seven and their ties to a

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:02.450
super drug known as Compound V.

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:06.400
This was the drug that A-Train was on when
he killed Hughie’s girlfriend and they slowly

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.999
unearth that it’s the formula that is used
to create super-powered beings.

00:04:09.999 --> 00:04:14.170
It’s not just Vought that are using it either
and they also discover a young female that

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.639
has been caged and experimented on too and
she eventually ends up joining them.

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:21.930
Realising that evidence of this could bring
down the public’s perception of the group,

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.670
with the help of Starlight, he and the boys
do whatever they can to get a hold of it in

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:28.000
order to expose the dark side of the supes.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Homelander
________________

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.520
However, their attacks and Starlights public
stance soon draw the attention of The Higher

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.310
Ups and their overlord Homelander who makes
Brandon from Brightburn look like teacher’s

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.069
pet and he soon begins striking back.

00:04:40.069 --> 00:04:44.229
Homelander is a twisted version of Superman
and Captain America that pretty much embodies

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:49.150
many of the criticisms about the USA and it’s
self-interest to the detriment of others.

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:53.940
He’s brash, arrogant and will step over
people to get to the top and throughout he’s

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.150
pretty much the character that you love to
hate.

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:00.490
After refusing to save the lives of a doomed
flight he uses this tragedy as a reason to

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:04.810
equip the army and invade other countries
and this becomes a clear metaphor for the

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:06.490
Iraq War after the events of 9/11.

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:10.800
In the comics whilst Homelander was said to
be an alien that came to Earth, it’s actually

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:15.030
revealed that he is also in fact a government
experiment that was made in order to market

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:16.460
superheroes to humanity.

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:20.660
He’s a marketing ploy like all of the other
supes and whilst I don’t wanna spoil too

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:25.600
much just yet this over-inflated ego eventually
leads to his downfall.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:29.970
Anyway there’s reality tv, confessions and
an appearance by Haley Joel Osmont that will

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:34.590
have your sixth sense tingling and overall
the season gets you really invested into both

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:35.590
sides.

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:36.590
What Happened To Butcher’s Wife?

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:37.590
________________

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:39.650
It’s revealed that Homelander actually impregnated
Butchers wife and due to carrying a baby with

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:43.310
super-strength it apparently killed her from
the inside during the Labour.

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:46.289
He’s told that his baby died during the
birth though we Naturally when the Superman

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:53.520
discovers this betrayal and coverup by his
owners he begins to slowly descend into madness.

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:58.440
The CIA also have enough evidence to blackmail
Vought into retracting their military application

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:03.199
however they soon realise that several other
countries also have access to V due to Homelander’s

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:07.610
black market dealings and thus they cannot
go public as it will weaken the position of

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:09.580
America’s defense against the new Superpowers.

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:10.580
The Boys Ending Explained
________________

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:14.000
Homelander has created an arms race that means
he will forever be needed.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.349
Butcher learns of Stilwell’s connection
to Homelander and realises that she is his

00:06:17.349 --> 00:06:19.599
weakness and takes her hostage.

00:06:19.599 --> 00:06:22.940
Homelander isn’t one to pay fair though
and after he brings Madelyn’s baby to the

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:27.199
standoff and reveals that it wasn’t he who
killed his wife but rather Madelyn, things

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:29.289
get a little messy.

00:06:29.289 --> 00:06:32.860
Homelander burns through Madelyn’s head
and no amount of having a mother named Martha

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:34.900
is gonna get Butcher out of it.

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:39.710
So he sets off the C4 attached to Madelyn
but unfortunately for him, Homelander is too

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:45.800
fast and takes him away to reveal to Butcher
that his wife and Homelanders son are both

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:46.800
alive.

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:51.080
We get an awesome Star Wars-esque cliffhanger
and the show goes out with a lot of questions.

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:52.080
So what happens next?

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:53.080

Season Two Predictions
________________

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:57.979
Well, huge spoilers for the comics here and
Homelanders eventual fate so if you don’t

00:06:57.979 --> 00:07:02.879
want to know anything then I highly suggest
that you turn off now.

00:07:02.879 --> 00:07:07.450
Whilst the story highly alters the timeline
of the graphic novels with Madelyn out of

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:11.610
the picture I think Homelander will ascend
further within Vought and this will Mirror

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:13.220
his comic arc highly.

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:19.430
In the books, Homelander eventually is sent
insane after he’s shown photographs of atrocities

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:22.580
that he has committed even though he has no
memory of them.

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:26.770
Feeling like he has no other way out he assumes
high command of everything and attacks the

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:28.139
White House.

00:07:28.139 --> 00:07:32.090
Homelander has wished to create an uprising
and this is why he armed others with V and

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:35.759
eventually he goes on to kill the president
in order to rule the country himself.

00:07:35.759 --> 00:07:39.712
However, it’s revealed that Black Noir is
actually a clone of the character that was

00:07:39.712 --> 00:07:42.000
created to kill Homelander should he ever
step out of line.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.689
Noir was the one in the photographs and Homelander
realises that he could’ve actually been

00:07:45.689 --> 00:07:49.110
a hero if he’d not been so easily manipulated.

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:53.259
Lander dies at the hands of Noir who is eventually
killed by Butcher.

00:07:53.259 --> 00:07:54.259
homelander death the boys graphic novel

00:07:54.259 --> 00:07:57.930
I can definitely see this being the direction
that the series heads in with Butcher eventually

00:07:57.930 --> 00:08:01.650
attempting to get back his wife and having
to deal with the fact that there is a new

00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:14.750
member of the family.

00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:19.000
Now people may be wondering what happens to
Hughie and how he gets out of saving A-Train

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.000
at the end.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.449
Well in the graphic novel series he too gains
incredible powers and abilities after he is

00:08:24.449 --> 00:08:26.940
injected with V compound worth 19 billion
dollars and I think this will be brought into

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:31.439
the second series as his get out of jail free
card so that he is not hunted and killed as

00:08:31.439 --> 00:08:33.180
easily as he would be without it.

00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:37.260
He’s definitely the wildcard of the show
and I can see Season Two focusing on the fact

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:40.970
that he now has become the thing he hated
and that once more he has a choice as to whether

00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:42.849
go the right path or wrong one.

00:08:42.849 --> 00:08:46.280
No doubt with Starlight at his side he can
do good and the two could actually become

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:49.560
the superheroes that the world both needs
and deserves down the line.

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:52.860
Either way, there’s a lot to look forward
to with the Boys and I can’t wait to see

00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:56.330
how the changes affect the season going forward.

00:08:56.330 --> 00:09:00.980
Your Thoughts
________________

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:15.590
Obviously, I’d love to hear your thoughts
on The Boys and what your favourite moment

00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:16.710
of Season One was.

00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:20.590
I haven’t even mentioned the Simon Pegg
part that is a tie in to the original graphic

00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:21.690
novel.

00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:27.150
Damn, anyway Leave your review and let me
know, I’m also interested to see what people

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:50.200
prefer out of this and The Umbrella Academy
so drop your opinion

00:09:50.200 --> 00:10:11.770
in the comments below.
