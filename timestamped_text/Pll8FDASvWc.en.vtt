00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:26.800
he seems to be in pain and shock, then he couldn’t&nbsp;
resist so he reverses the car back to a Motel.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:32.800
He then grabs a key from the front desk,&nbsp;
and he leaves. He goes to a Motel room,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:40.160
and there he finds his wife, Amy, having an affair&nbsp;
with his friend, Ted. Six months Later, after the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.840
incident, Morton is living in an isolated cabin&nbsp;
at Tashmore Lake New York. Morton is suffering&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.480
from Depression and Writer’s block, which is like&nbsp;
Burnout, and he is delayed in writing new books.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.800
A man named, John Shooter, arrives to his&nbsp;
cabin, and he accuses him of stealing his story,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.680
Morton denies it and he says he will never&nbsp;
take accusations about plagiarism lightly.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.720
Shooter then tries to give him his own&nbsp;
manuscript as a proof, but Morton closes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:13.280
the door. He then leaves, then Morton tries to&nbsp;
remember his license plate. Once Shooter leaves,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:19.120
he goes out and he finds that the guy left the&nbsp;
manuscript outside his door. Manuscript is named,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:25.840
Sowing Season., by John Shooter. He then dumps&nbsp;
it in the trash, and he tries to sleep again.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:32.720
Later, he asks his dog, if he can give him any&nbsp;
suggestions to continue the book. He looks at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.120
his manuscript and he thinks that he no longer&nbsp;
possesses any abilities to write anything good.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:43.440
Tired from everything, he erases what he just&nbsp;
wrote. Later, his maid tells him that she found&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.560
his story in the trash, so she took it out.&nbsp;
He reads few lines in it, and he learns that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.840
it is very similar to his own story called,&nbsp;
Secret Window. He panics and drops the drink.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:00.560
He apologizes to the maid, but she feels bad that&nbsp;
his manuscript is ruined, he denies it by saying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:06.320
he didn’t write this, and that it is written by&nbsp;
John Shooter. He then reads his own work; he is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:12.320
shocked to see the story to be exactly the same.&nbsp;
He gets a vision of his wife; she opens a window,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:17.280
and she tells him it’s a secret window. He&nbsp;
feels like smoking, and he assures his dog&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.480
that he didn’t steal the story, the maid shows up&nbsp;
and she assures him that his wife did a mistake by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.960
cheating, and some women don’t realize when they&nbsp;
have the whole world in front of them, and she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:32.880
leaves. Once she leaves, he goes downstairs, still&nbsp;
telling himself that he didn’t steal the story.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:39.520
He then gets a strange vision in his sleep.&nbsp;
He wakes up from a phone call. Amy, is worried&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:44.960
about his well-being, and she wants to know if&nbsp;
he is doing, ok? And if their dog is doing well.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.640
He then asks her about his story, Secret&nbsp;
Window, he asks her if she shared his story&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.200
with anyone and she cannot recall, he asks&nbsp;
her to meet up with Ted for some drinks,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.080
but she is not interested and she is happy with&nbsp;
his friend Ted. He wishes them luck to live in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:05.360
house that he bought from his money, and he hangs&nbsp;
up, only to blame himself again for everything.

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.280
The next day, he goes to the woods, and he&nbsp;
finds John Shooter there waiting for him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.760
Morton wants to know when Shooter wrote his&nbsp;
version of the book, since he wants to know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:22.080
who wrote the story first, Shooter claims that&nbsp;
he wrote the story 7 years ago in the year 1997,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:27.920
and he then starts roasting him like Beef.&nbsp;
Morton claims that he wrote the story in 1994,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.040
it means he wrote it 3 years before him, and&nbsp;
he invalidates all the accusations of Shooter.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.760
Shooter threatens him that he will go to his&nbsp;
house in New York, and say hi to his wife,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.720
Morton reveals that he is in middle of a divorce,&nbsp;
and he is no longer the owner of the house.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.200
Shooter warns him that beef with&nbsp;
him only ends in one of them dying,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.080
and then he gives him 3 days to prove that Morton&nbsp;
wrote the Book first or he will take him down.

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:59.040
Later that day, Morton is in disbelief, and&nbsp;
he asks his dog that despite being a blind dog&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:04.320
he still loves him, but then why nobody who can&nbsp;
see loves him. The dog hears something, and he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:09.920
goes outside. Morton is taking a nap, and he gets&nbsp;
another vision, that he fell from the height.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.160
He wakes up and he finds a note outside the door.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.680
He discovers that the light bulb is&nbsp;
broken, he then goes out to investigate,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:22.240
and he finds a note from Shooter issuing him&nbsp;
a warning and telling him not to go to police.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:28.560
Under the note, he finds his dog stabbed to&nbsp;
death. The next day, he makes a grave for his dog.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.920
Later, he goes to Sheriff Newsome, and&nbsp;
informs him about the note and his dog.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.440
Sheriff seems to be as if he is avoiding the&nbsp;
main topic, Morton wants him to talk with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:44.800
Shooter and he wants just peace nothing else, but&nbsp;
Sheriff talks about everything except the Topic.

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.000
Later that day, he goes to his&nbsp;
friend, a Private Investigator,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.360
Ken Karsch. They talk a bit, and it turns&nbsp;
out, Morton was accused earlier as well,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:00.480
and Ken took care of him, so he wants him to&nbsp;
help him this time as well. Morton claims that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:05.040
he has original copy of the book that he wrote&nbsp;
2 years before John Shooter wrote his version.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.840
Unfortunately, the book is at Amy’s house,&nbsp;
and they both are no longer together.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.880
Ken jokes about it by saying you must&nbsp;
have pounded other girls, in reality,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:20.480
Amy was pounding other guy. Then he apologizes and&nbsp;
Ken assures him that he will check on his house.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:27.840
Later, Morton goes back to his old house for the&nbsp;
manuscript, he sees Amy and Ted. Disgusted from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:32.960
the couple, he decides to leave from there.&nbsp;
Later that night, he gets back to his cabin,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:39.280
and he finds a car there. He goes next to it,&nbsp;
and he finds Ken dead. However, the only thing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:44.000
that is dead, is his Humor. Then they search&nbsp;
the cabin, and they don’t find anyone there.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:49.920
Morton claims that a guy named, Tom, saw him&nbsp;
and Shooter earlier when they were talking.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.680
Ken assures him that nothing will&nbsp;
happen, and he decides to leave.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.760
Morton asks him where he is staying&nbsp;
overnight, and it turns out,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:01.680
Ken will be living in the same Motel,&nbsp;
where Morton found his wife cheating.

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:08.560
Once Ken leaves, Morton hears a noise from&nbsp;
upstairs, he grabs a poker from the fireplace,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:14.240
and he goes upstairs but no one is there. Then&nbsp;
in the washroom, he sees a shadow in the mirror.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:19.840
Upon hearing no response, he goes there and&nbsp;
swings the hammer but only to break the mirror.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:26.000
He then breaks the shower door, and he finds a&nbsp;
mouse there. He then carefully grabs the mouse,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:32.160
and a cigarette that he is trying to stop. He&nbsp;
goes outside and frees the mouse, Shooter says,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.680
I thought you stopped smoking, revealing&nbsp;
he knows about him more than he thinks.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:41.440
Shooter says that you went to Amy’s house but&nbsp;
why you didn’t take the Book. Shooter wants him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:45.440
to fix the ending of his version of the book,&nbsp;
where the protagonist kills his cheating wife.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:52.080
He then mentions his wife by saying she is Spicy,&nbsp;
Morton attacks him, but Shooter overpowers him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:56.240
and he threatens that he will go after his&nbsp;
wife, if he won’t fix the ending in the book.

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:03.120
The next day, Morton gets a call from Amy, she is&nbsp;
freaking out, and she tells him that someone burnt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:08.240
their house. Morton goes there knowing that&nbsp;
now his original copy of the book is burnt.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:14.400
Amy and Ted arrive there, Detective talks to them&nbsp;
and reveals that the fire was started by using a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:19.440
Molotov Cocktail. He asks them if they’ve&nbsp;
any enemies, they say no, but Morton tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:24.560
them about Shooter. The Insurance investigator&nbsp;
gives them a list of items that they can claim,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:28.480
and since they both filed for the divorce,&nbsp;
the items will be distributed in half.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:34.400
Morton seems stressed from topic of his divorce,&nbsp;
but the investigator assures him that he will be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:39.920
fine, and she went through it as well. As they&nbsp;
both go through list, Ted seems to be nosy about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:45.040
the list, then Morton asks him to leave the room,&nbsp;
and he is forced to leave, since the items does&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:50.880
not belong to him. Later, Amy is afraid of Shooter&nbsp;
and, she wants him to pay him off, like they did&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:56.720
last time when one person accused him as well,&nbsp;
he assures her that nothing will happen. Then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:00.720
Ted and Morton talk about the relationship,&nbsp;
Ted wants him to disappear from their life.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:06.080
Morton asks him where the couple will go&nbsp;
after the house is burnt, Ted replies,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:12.000
a place called Shooter, Morton recalls that&nbsp;
the full name of other guy is John Shooter.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.360
Later that night, Morton gets back to the cabin,&nbsp;
and he gets a call from Ken, they talk a bit,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:23.200
that the only proof he had is burnt in the fire.&nbsp;
However, Ken reveals that he found a magazine that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:26.960
published his story which will prove his&nbsp;
innocence and it will arrive a day after.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.080
Further, Ken tells Morton that he went to&nbsp;
the guy named Tom, and he claims that Tom&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:36.160
was scared when Shooter was mentioned, so they&nbsp;
speculate that Shooter might have threatened him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:40.880
Morton claims that Ted might be involved since&nbsp;
he gave him a hint with the name shooter.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:45.280
Ken suggests that they should meet Tom&nbsp;
the next day and make him spit everything,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:51.120
Ken then prepares to see Tom. The next day, Morton&nbsp;
wakes up late and he missed the meeting time,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:56.400
and then he finds out that his car keys are&nbsp;
missing, he then prepares to leave, and he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:02.400
finds a Hat that shooter used to wear, outside the&nbsp;
door. He also goes to his car, and he finds it on.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:08.720
Surprisingly he finds a Cigarette bud in&nbsp;
it. He takes the hat as evidence. He goes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:13.760
to the place they agreed on meeting, he asks the&nbsp;
cashier, and he learns that Ken didn’t show up.

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:20.080
On the way back, Morton spots Ted at a gas&nbsp;
station, he didn’t expect him to be there,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:25.680
so he reverses the car, and he confronts him,&nbsp;
Ted says that he was coming there to meet him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:30.960
and then he demands that Morton should sign&nbsp;
the divorce paper. Since the beginning,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:36.000
Morton is hesitant to sign the papers and he&nbsp;
still thinks that he can get his wife back, so he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.520
rages up, and he speculates that Ted is working&nbsp;
for Shooter, and he leaves. He gets back to home,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:47.200
sooner, he gets a call from Shooter, asking him&nbsp;
to meet at the same place for a special gift.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:54.400
Morton goes there in sports mode, he arrives&nbsp;
to a jeep, and he finds Tom killed with an axe,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:54.400 --> 00:10:00.160
and that Ken is killed as well. Morton passes&nbsp;
out from the incident, only to wake up and find&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:05.360
Shooter next to him. Shooter states that those&nbsp;
two men are killed with an axe from Morton’s house&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:11.200
with his fingerprints on it. Morton claims that he&nbsp;
has the magazine, and he can prove his innocence,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:15.680
Shooter demands that he wants him to fix the&nbsp;
ending of his story to his version of the book,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:20.480
Morton sticks to his innocence and Shooter&nbsp;
states that he is not crazy and there cannot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:25.520
be any magazine, but if there is any, then he&nbsp;
will hand himself to the police and he leaves.

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:33.120
Later, Morton retrieves his tools from Tom’s&nbsp;
head, in order to get rid of evidence. He then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:38.480
pushes Tom’s Jeep off the cliff, but his hand&nbsp;
watch gets stuck in the turn signal, he manages&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:43.280
to free his hand, but the watch is left inside the&nbsp;
jeep, and it falls off from there into the water.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:49.520
He then gets back to home and he gets a call from&nbsp;
Amy, she is worried about him, she is crying,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:53.600
and she thinks if they didn’t lose their baby&nbsp;
in the past the things would have turned out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:59.040
to be different. He asks her what she thinks&nbsp;
of Ted, and she claims that she loves Ted,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:03.920
she thinks that Morton was busy since last 2 years&nbsp;
in writing books and he never had time for her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:08.240
and she wants him to sign the papers, only&nbsp;
to reveal that she was being nice to him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:11.840
to make him sign the divorce papers,&nbsp;
so he aggressively hangs up the phone.

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:16.640
Amy prepares herself to confront&nbsp;
him with the divorce papers,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:21.760
Ted wants to go with her, but she denies&nbsp;
it. Since, it will make the things worse.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:28.080
Later, Morton goes to the post office to&nbsp;
retrieve his package containing the magazine.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:32.960
The lady working there gives him the package, and&nbsp;
she tells him that she saw everything what he did,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:38.560
only to correct herself that she saw his new&nbsp;
look appealing. He then goes back to car,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:44.000
the sheriff approaches him, and he says&nbsp;
he is busy. At home, Ted is worried,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:49.920
so he decides to go to the cabin as well. Morton&nbsp;
learns that the package is already opened, he then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:54.640
checks the magazine, and he finds out that someone&nbsp;
ripped off pages of his story from the magazine.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:55.520 --> 00:12:00.400
He talks to himself that how is it possible, he&nbsp;
gets inside the cabin and sees Shooter’s hat,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:07.040
and he puts it on. Soon, he starts speaking to&nbsp;
himself, his inner self claims that he should&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:12.720
call police and they should put him in a prison,&nbsp;
before he does any more damage. His inner self&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:17.840
claims further that there is no John Shooter&nbsp;
at all, and it is all in his head. Morton is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:22.480
getting frustrated and uncomfortable, and&nbsp;
he throws an object at the wall, and then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:26.960
surprisingly the crack starts growing rapidly to&nbsp;
the point that it fractures the cabin in half.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:31.280
He looks in the mirror, and he is shocked&nbsp;
to see the back of his head in the mirror.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:36.000
Shooter appears, and he starts revealing&nbsp;
that Morton gave birth to his character.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:40.240
He reveals that it was he himself,&nbsp;
who started the fire in the house,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:46.720
then it was he who took Tom and Ken to an isolated&nbsp;
area and then killed them, Morton realizes that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:51.840
John Shooter is just a figment of his imagination,&nbsp;
and he needs to fix the story to get rid of him.

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:58.880
Sooner, Amy arrives at the cabin, she walks,&nbsp;
and she finds the page from the magazine,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:02.640
she looks for Morton and she&nbsp;
finds the house all messed up,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:05.840
there is an empty bottle of Jack&nbsp;
Daniels and empty cigarette packet,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:12.080
she hears some noise from upstairs, and she finds&nbsp;
the word, Shooter, carved repeatedly on the table,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:17.360
and everywhere in the house, along with&nbsp;
the walls. Morton appears Infront of her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:23.600
speaking and acting like Shooter and wearing his&nbsp;
hat as well. He then attacks her with a scissor,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:29.680
but she manages to approach her car. He then fixes&nbsp;
the hat, and he takes a stone to break the window.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:36.160
He pulls her out from the car, and he drags her&nbsp;
back into the cabin. She tries to run, but she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:42.320
falls to the ground hitting her head to a rock,&nbsp;
he reveals that the word shooter means shoot her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:46.800
from his desire to shoot her. Sooner,&nbsp;
Ted arrives there looking for Amy,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:53.040
Morton hits him with the shovel as Amy watches&nbsp;
it helplessly, he then kills him with it. He then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:58.320
goes to her and says the quote from his book that,&nbsp;
One day her death will be a mystery, even to me.

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:04.800
Few months later, Morton recovers from his&nbsp;
condition, and he goes to a store, there he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:09.760
sees the lady who works in the post office, she&nbsp;
seems to be scared and she tries to avoid him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:16.000
The sheriff arrives to the cabin, the cabin now&nbsp;
seems to be well organized with a lot of corn in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:21.920
the kitchen. Morton invites the sheriff upstairs&nbsp;
and the sheriff claims that everyone knows what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:27.920
he did, and eventually the bodies of the missing&nbsp;
people will be found, and he will be caught. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:32.080
tells him that people are uncomfortable to see&nbsp;
him in the town, and he is no longer welcomed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:37.920
there. Morton says the only thing that matters is&nbsp;
the ending, and this one is the perfect ending.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:42.720
It is assumed that the body of Amy and&nbsp;
Ted are buried under the garden of corn.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:49.040
And he says one day her death will be a&nbsp;
mystery, even to me. And the movie ends,&nbsp;&nbsp;
