00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.950
If a highly intelligent, parasitic pathogen
began infecting and reconstituting your friends

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:09.059
into meat monsters, what would you do?

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.249
In this video on Nerd Explains, we’ll follow
the characters, see if we can make better

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:17.860
decisions, and ultimately attempt to beat
the thing in, The Thing.

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.940
If you think you have a better way to beat
the alien pathogen, let me know in the comments!

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:25.130

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:30.370
We start out following a Norwegion research
team in Antarctica, chasing down an unusual

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:32.370
radio signal emitting from under the ice.

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:33.370
* It’s not exactly an Independence Day signal..

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:34.920
* ...Which would warrant a Def-Con Level 1
response, but radiowaves don’t originate

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.530
from ice, so the origin of the signal is worth
checking out.

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.890
Once on top of the signal, their snowcat breaks
through the ice and they drop into a giant

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:41.890
chasm.

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.470
With incredible luck they aren’t killed,
they crank on the headlights, revealing what

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.030
appears to be a spacecraft.

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:52.200
* I’m guessing this spaceship didn’t crash
recently, as the ice was frozen back over,

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.930
and it’s unlikely that nobody detected it
hitting the Earth.

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.540
Since this craft crashed and froze awhile
ago, I see no need to hunt it down in the

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:01.540
winter.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.939
It sounds stupid to say winter in Antarctica,
but the summer is actually significantly warmer

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.609
and more survivable.

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:11.329
Winter can get down to negative double or
triple digits, while summer can get up to

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:12.889
around 0 degrees.

00:01:12.889 --> 00:01:22.000
In the winter of 1982 in Antarctica, the temperatures
were recorded as reaching as low as -117 degrees.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.280
* Unless they packed 3 sets of ice picks,
ascending 100 to 200 feet of shear ice ain’t

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.280
gonna happen.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.320
Even if they did, they would only have limited
equipment and shelter as the truck with all

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.280
the gear is in the chasm.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.899
Unless their research facility and team members
are close by, they’re probably dead.

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:43.590
Our main protagonist, Kate Lloyd, is in a
different chasm, investigating the remains

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.119
of a thawing 27,500 year old cave bear.

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:51.799
She’s a vertebrate paleontologist who's
about to get an up close encounter with the

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:53.420
thing the Norwegion’s found.

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.359
The team makes haste and takes a chopper to
the crash site, where we get some not so subtle

00:01:58.359 --> 00:02:05.079
foreshadowing.

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:09.569
Kate Lloyd is warned by other members of the
team that they need to wrap up their expedition

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.430
in a few days, as a nasty storm is moving
in.

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:25.209
* 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:29.920
Storms in Antarctica aren’t that frequent,
but when they do hit, they can be really bad.

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.709
The storms can cause white-out conditions
with visibility of less than 3 feet for days

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:35.709
at a time.

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:37.319
They are avoidable though.

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:41.530
If the expedition was postponed a week until
after the storm, they’d likely have a whole

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.849
month before the next one came, and it’d
be safer working conditions for an excavation.

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:51.860
Like we talked about earlier, this craft and
specimen has been there for a long time already,

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.030
so it’s not like waiting a few days later
will hurt.

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.079
Using the Spryte, the crew makes their way
to the site of the spacecraft.

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:02.150
* Once inside, we get a look at the spacecraft,
it’s absolutely massive.

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:07.319
They estimate the craft has been there for
100,000 years.

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:10.810
* Wait what.

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:16.689
* It’s possible that the alien in the ship
picked up our radio waves, and, realizing

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:22.120
it could finally signal to an intelligent
species for help, activated it’s distress

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.120
signal.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:28.360
* As far as how the alien survived for 100,00
years inside the spaceship trapped in ice.

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.434
It was probably cryonically preserved, and
only awakened once the ship picked up our

00:03:31.434 --> 00:03:32.434
distinct electromagnetic waves.

00:03:32.434 --> 00:03:35.790
The research crew is then taken to the alien
specimen, which had attempted to escape on

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:36.790
foot.

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:37.851
It didn’t make it very far though.

00:03:37.851 --> 00:03:38.851
* Remember, temperatures can drop down to
-120 degrees here, which begs the question.

00:03:38.851 --> 00:03:39.851
Why did the alien leave the ship, when it’s
certain death?

00:03:39.851 --> 00:03:42.390
* This alien’s pretty big and has claws,
it looks reptilian almost.

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:47.209
Sure, it’s encased in ice, but maybe we
should bring in some firepower for security

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:48.209
sake.

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:49.659
Maybe I watch too many movies..

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:52.709
The crew begins planning the alien excavation.

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:56.390
* Holy shit it’s Tormund, I thought the
Wildlings were in the North.

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:01.909
Dr. Sander explicitly commands the crew to
stay off the radio, to avoid any information

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:04.650
getting out.

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:10.580
* I was just beginning to wonder why nobody
was alerting the authorities.

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:15.030
Sure, I get that they want to make the discovery
and intimately be a part of researching the

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.700
alien, which you wouldn’t get to do if the
Government started intervening.

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:24.420
But, they are paleontologists, ecologists,
and geologists, dealing with an alien spaceship

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:25.420
and body.

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:27.850
I think it’s fair to say, they’re out
of their depth.

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:32.530
* If they had divulged their discovery to
organizations that had the equipment knowledge,

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:37.820
and capabilities for securing and containing
a potential alien lifeform, this whole mess

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:39.190
could have been avoided.

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:44.060
As we’ll see soon, this crew makes a ton
of foolish mistakes which leads to the thing

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:45.060
getting free.

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:49.590
It is reasonable that scientists would selfishly
want to take a first stab at checking out

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:54.470
an alien ship, so let’s continue as if we
decided not to get outside help.

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:59.100
* We get to meet the rest of the team, and
it appears the first three gentlemen did survive

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:00.970
the drop into the chasm.

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:10.670
Another researcher, Adam, has the same perplexing
question I do:

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:16.280
* The only reasonable answer, is that this
thing must be really dumb..

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.560
The next day they haul the ice block containing
the alien into camp.

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:25.340
* It seems like an obvious precaution to take
when dealing with a thawing alien creature

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:30.930
is to wear level A personal protective equipment,
which should be worn when skin, respiratory,

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:32.580
and eye protection is required.

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:38.340
I would think that dealing with an alien,
whose body will no doubt contain alien microbes,

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:40.340
would warrant this level of protection.

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:45.270
* There have been numerous cases of people
picking up pathogens from old thawing objects

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:46.270
and creatures.

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:51.740
Not too long ago, there was an anthrax outbreak
caused by old thawing reindeer corpses, as

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:56.130
well as an archaeologist that picked up a
skin infection from handling an old polar

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:58.340
bear skull without protection.

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:02.910
Always use protection when fondling old polar
bear skulls, you never know where that head’s

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:03.910
been.

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:05.160
* It’s pretty common sense stuff, especially
when dealing with a fucking alien.

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.310
* Since this thing is an alien, we don’t
know it’s capabilities at all.

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:12.250
It could be a cyborg, it could have a life
support suit, it might not be killed easily

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:15.110
by cold conditions, it could be super strong.

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:20.070
There’s a lot of unknowns, so just assuming
this alien is dead and throwing it in the

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:23.009
shed is just a little too careless, to put
it lightly.

00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:26.180
* They’ve already made a few major mistakes
so far.

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:30.840
Attempting to research an alien spacecraft
and creature without letting anyone know,

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:42.190
and doing so without any protective equipment,
secure containment facilities, or weapons.

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:44.330
At least Kate has some brains.

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:48.550
The crew proceeds to not give a single shit,
whips out a power drill you’d pick off the

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:54.500
rack at Lowes, and drills into the alien.

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:59.270
After studying the alien’s tissue sample,
Dr. Sander announces that he has never seen

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:01.380
anything like it on a cellular level.

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:04.550
It’s a monumental discovery for mankind.

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:09.340
* Which is why they’ve taken care to secure
the alien corpse in a melting block of ice

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:10.990
in a wooden storage shed.

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:15.410
* I know all safety has been thrown out the
window, but for science’s sake, wouldn’t

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:20.390
you want to keep the ice from melting prematurely
as decomposition would set in and destroy

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:22.730
the alien corpse?

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:26.490
Ah, that’s why.

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:31.150
The most important scientific discovery of
the millennium is being safeguarded by a bunch

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:33.220
of drunken buffoons.

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:37.610
Another crew member decides to check out the
unsecured alien that’s kept in the storage

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:39.910
shed, while everyone’s plastered.

00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:43.370
Welp, I think containment was breached.

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:48.750
Great, now there’s a Xenomorph on the loose
and everyone is hammered.

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:53.500
Derek breaks the news, and they all don their
winter coats and split up to search for it

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:55.360
with nothing but flashlights.

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:59.650
* Good idea guys, don’t wait until morning,
don’t stay together, and don’t get anything

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:01.530
that can be used to defend yourselves.

00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:06.060
It’s not like this giant Xenomorph looking
alien just superman’ed out of a block of

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:08.560
ice and through the roof of the shed or anything.

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:18.169
I’m sure search groups of 2 or 3 people
at night will be sufficient.

00:08:18.169 --> 00:08:19.500
* Understatement of the year.

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:24.310
* Personally, I’d grab gear and weapons,
then move everyone together to the most secure,

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:26.450
well-built part of the camp to hold out.

00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:31.140
Like before, the alien won’t survive the
freezing conditions so it can’t leave the

00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:32.140
camp.

00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:33.890
It will hide somewhere in the camp, but trying
to catch it is too dangerous.

00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:38.620
* Then I'd make contact with the U.S. that
we discovered an alien craft and survivor.

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:42.480
Help should arrive within a day or so to properly
secure and contain the alien.

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:46.840
* I’m betting they wait until the storm
hits, then try to radio home for help, at

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:50.260
which point it will be broken and rescue is
impossible.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:54.960
* If for some reason you do want to catch
it, wait until morning when visibility isn’t

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:55.960
a problem.

00:08:55.960 --> 00:09:00.710
I’d put 2 people with a radio in the water
tower like Private Jackson &amp; Parker in Saving

00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:08.770
Private Ryan, so they could coordinate the
ground teams and watch for the alien.

00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:13.600
* Then have the rest of the crew grab flamethrowers
and weapons, and sweep through the compound,

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:15.760
clearing it room by room together.

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:18.990
Maintain visual contact with each other as
best as you can.

00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:23.620
This alien was frozen, drilled into, and is
probably a bit agitated.

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:27.430
You don’t have to barbecue it, but if it
gets rowdy you’ll have options.

00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:31.610
Take care to maintain open lines of fire by
using an L shaped formation.

00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:36.030
If you surround the alien, using the flamethrower
becomes dangerous as you’re likely to hit

00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:37.180
your friends.

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:40.960
Looks like the alien was hungry, but it’s
still nowhere to be found.

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:46.780
We cut over to two unnamed and expendable
researchers, completely isolated and in darkness,

00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:48.070
hunting for a pissed off alien.

00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:51.370
I’m sure they’ll be just fine.

00:09:51.370 --> 00:10:00.880
The other guy doesn’t need to radio for
help, as his screaming at the sight of his

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:04.080
friend being sucked into an alien’s belly
will do.

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:08.140
Who could have foreseen that the alien would
completely outmatch and attack them.

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:11.770
The rest of the crew shows up to help watch
their friend get consumed.

00:10:11.770 --> 00:10:15.690
To Dr. Sander’s dismay, they open fire on
the alien with pistols.

00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:20.580
The alien shrugs off their puny calibers,
so they toss over a can of kerosene and light

00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:23.060
it up with a superbly placed flare.

00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:25.200
* Honestly, that throw was on point.

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:28.060
I’d have missed and bounced the flare off
the side of the shed.

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:32.680
Kudos as well for not trying to shoot the
kerosene, we all know that doesn’t work.

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:35.300
Fire-bombing the alien seemed to do the trick.

00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:40.040
Back at the lodge, there’s a standoff between
Dr. Sander and Sam Carter, the chopper pilot

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:43.770
and expert flare thrower, as to what to do
with the body.

00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:48.390
Sanders wants to perform an autopsy, and Carter
wants to completely destroy it.

00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:50.550
* We know it’s the thing, but they don’t.

00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:54.360
I personally would choose to autopsy it in
the name of science.

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:56.230
* But with one minor condition.

00:10:56.230 --> 00:11:01.830
That the autopsy isn’t performed by us,
but by another agency that’s more well-equipped

00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:04.900
and has the firepower and intelligence to
contain it.

00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:13.500
It should be painfully obvious that we aren’t
able to handle the situation.

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:17.250
Until they could arrive, I’d just guard
the alien body with flamethrowers.

00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:22.000
* The crew quickly begins autopsying the alien
corpse, under the assumption that it’ll

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.670
start decomposing, I guess.

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:28.520
But bodies at the morgue are kept at low negative
temperatures in order to significantly slow

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:31.660
rates of decomposition until an autopsy can
occur.

00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:35.980
If you leave the alien corpse outside in Antarctica,
the temperatures are more than adequate for

00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:38.040
storing it until another agency arrives.

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:42.610
* It looks like the giant bug alien was only
able to devour half of Henrik.

00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:47.030
* But good god, this has to be the most horrific
autopsy you could be asked to do.

00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:51.430
I’d be hopping on Sam’s chopper to get
out of this shitshow as soon as possible.

00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:55.819
This arrogant scientist and his lackeys are
definitely gonna get themselves killed.

00:11:55.819 --> 00:12:00.420
* Jesus Christ, he’s literally performing
an autopsy without any PPE on his face.

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:05.610
It’s fairly common for bodily juices to
squirt out of corpses when performing autopsies,

00:12:05.610 --> 00:12:07.980
which is why they wear facemasks.

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:12.380
Everyone else in the room is literally breathing
alien corpse air into their lungs.

00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:17.170
* Also, they’re wearing the same gloves
that sandwich artists at Subway use, which

00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:20.070
obviously aren’t meant for open alien surgery.

00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:25.350
I know I'm hammering on using PPE a lot, but
as the saying goes, an ounce of prevention

00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:26.800
is worth a pound of cure.

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:31.790
* It’s worth noting that the creature survived
being frozen without a protective suit, and

00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:34.420
we know it’s not a cyborg of any sort.

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:39.910
Most organisms can’t survive rapid freezing
as it causes intracellular ice crystallization

00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:41.890
which destroys the cells.

00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:46.890
This means that the alien shares properties
of known extremophile organisms called Psychrophiles,

00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:51.370
which can survive and reproduce at near 0
degree temperatures.

00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:55.710
* I’m not sure why he said their friend
was encased in some type of amniotic sac,

00:12:55.710 --> 00:13:00.180
the alien was not exactly giving birth to
Henrik, quite the opposite actually.

00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:04.100
Kate pulls out a loose piece of metal used
to reinforce broken bones.

00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:07.680
The fact that it was just loosely floating
around in there is a bit odd.

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:12.311
Kate and Adam use a microscope to study a
blood and tissue sample of the alien, which

00:13:12.311 --> 00:13:14.660
reveals the nature of the thing.

00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:18.960
* I’m sure Dr. Sanders would find this fascinating,
and it is.

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:23.730
But it’s also clearly an incredibly dangerous
pathogen that needs to be handled with immense

00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:24.730
care.

00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:29.779
* Nobody has used PPE, the alien in the autopsy
room is still alive on a cellular level, and

00:13:29.779 --> 00:13:32.950
one of the crew members was splattered in
the face with blood.

00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:38.350
With how infectious and dangerous this pathogen
is, it cannot be allowed to leave the station.

00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:40.000
Containment needs to be ensured.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.649
* This would be a breach in containment.

00:13:41.649 --> 00:13:44.029
He needs to be quarantined along with the
alien.

00:13:44.029 --> 00:13:47.610
He hasn’t suffered any mortal wounds, only
minor shock.

00:13:47.610 --> 00:13:49.360
So he doesn’t need to travel to a hospital.

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:54.170
While washing her hands in the bathroom, Kate
notices what look like metal fillings on the

00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:55.170
ground.

00:13:55.170 --> 00:13:56.200
* Please don’t pick it up.

00:13:56.200 --> 00:14:00.550
* Oh, thank god she used a napkin to pick
up the lethal pathogen.

00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:03.910
* This is the same sort of thing we saw with
Henrik and his metal plate.

00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:07.660
But that occurred inside an alien which contained
the imitating blood.

00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:11.100
This would only happen if this guy’s infected
with the same pathogen.

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:14.990
* You can’t just remove fillings without
the tooth coming with it, so something is

00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:15.990
not right here.

00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:18.990
We have to stop the helicopter from leaving
until we know what’s happening.

00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:23.350
Kate’s a clever girl, so she pieces this
together and flags the chopper down before

00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:24.350
they leave.

00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:28.490
* Kate needs to get a weapon, preferably one
that throws fire, and isolate the infected

00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:29.600
guy quickly.

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:34.500
If he’s just an imitated alien, and no longer
himself, stopping the thing from leaving will

00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:35.830
provoke it to attack.

00:14:35.830 --> 00:14:41.230
The bug was made up of the same infected cells
as this guy, and it wasn’t exactly peaceful

00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:42.420
when confronted.

00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:56.680
The bug also wasn’t stopped by bullets.

00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:59.310
* It wasn’t Henrik, as Kate suspected.

00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:03.300
Griggs was likely infected and assimilated
by the doggo-thing.

00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:06.730
Looks like beer wasn’t the only thing he
brought back to the party.

00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:14.290
Sam can’t put the chopper down gently amidst
the chaos, and crash lands far from the base.

00:15:14.290 --> 00:15:18.550
* What do ya know, they just now try to use
the radio but it doesn’t work because of

00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:20.160
the impending storm.

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:23.390
Not that help would be able to arrive in the
storm if they could make contact.

00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:32.530
Kate returns to the bathroom, to assess the
bloody shower, except, all the blood is gone.

00:15:32.530 --> 00:15:44.660
This 
thing is still here.

00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:47.089
* Can someone pistol whip this guy already.

00:15:47.089 --> 00:15:51.180
He’s already gotten people killed, and I'm
sure a whole lot more will die because of

00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:52.180
him.

00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:53.180
The crew decides to go to a nearby research
station for help.

00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:54.180
But thankfully Kate stops them.

00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:55.180
She briefs the rest of the crew on her discovery
from the microscopy, that this thing can replicate

00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:56.180
people.

00:15:56.180 --> 00:15:57.180
According to Kate, one of the weaknesses of
the thing is that it can’t copy inorganic

00:15:57.180 --> 00:15:58.180
material.

00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:01.330
* In the movie, the stubborn researchers disregard
her warnings which leads to a lot of unnecessary

00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:02.330
death.

00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:06.640
You literally have a blood sample, and an
alien corpse full of the pathogen.

00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:10.940
All you need to do is show them the blood
sample under a microscope, it’s irrefutable

00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:11.980
evidence.

00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:16.610
Once the crew is onboard with your assertions,
you can begin to quarantine and destroy the

00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:19.550
thing.

00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:24.670
* Since this thing is already here and imitating
people, you can’t trust anyone without verification.

00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:27.060
It could be in this room with us right now.

00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:31.840
The fact that it assimilates organisms on
a cellular level means that it’s not only

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:35.490
intelligent, but could possess an identical
brain structure.

00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:40.200
It might be able to imitate the intelligence,
memories, and behavior of it’s victim.

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:44.940
The only reliable way of detecting the thing
is with a blood sample.

00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:49.801
* Move everyone outside, so if the thing attacks,
you can torch it without burning the whole

00:16:49.801 --> 00:16:50.870
building down.

00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:55.870
Since this thing can’t replicate inorganic
material, check for fillings on a few people.

00:16:55.870 --> 00:16:59.999
Then, send those people to get blood testing
kits and flamethrowers.

00:16:59.999 --> 00:17:04.721
* We know that whoever the thing is, they’re
composed of the same cells the bug was, which

00:17:04.721 --> 00:17:07.779
means they’re indestructible to small arms.

00:17:07.779 --> 00:17:11.709
* Before rooting out the thing, which will
provoke it to attack, make sure you have the

00:17:11.709 --> 00:17:13.269
flamethrowers lit.

00:17:13.269 --> 00:17:17.789
Eventually the blood tests will reveal the
thing, which you can then burn to ashes.

00:17:17.789 --> 00:17:22.799
The dog-thing will need to be found and destroyed,
as well as a similar procedure performed on

00:17:22.799 --> 00:17:25.699
any survivors of the helicopter crash.

00:17:25.699 --> 00:17:27.799
* Nearby stations would also need to be warned.

00:17:27.799 --> 00:17:33.080
Later in the movie, we find out that a nearby
Russian station is 50 miles from them.

00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:39.059
Alaskan Malamutes, like Lars’s dog, race
in the Iditarod and can cover over 100 miles

00:17:39.059 --> 00:17:40.360
in a single day.

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:44.260
It’s possible that the dog-thing could reach
other stations on foot.

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:55.460
This is confirmed by the 1982 sequel.

00:17:55.460 --> 00:18:00.450
* If the crew still disregarded us like in
the movie, I’d prepare myself for the eventuality

00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:04.980
that everyone will be killed and assimilated,
based on their complete lack of regard for

00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:08.149
an deadly, insidious alien pathogen.

00:18:08.149 --> 00:18:13.940
Grab gear, weapons, packaged food and bottled
water, secure a radio, then isolate myself

00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:15.290
from everyone else.

00:18:15.290 --> 00:18:20.240
Once the interference clears up, let the world
know that a deadly pathogen from an alien

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:23.590
was found, and to proceed with extreme caution,
etc.

00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:28.230
* Members of our crew decide to break containment
and head to the nearby Halley research station

00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:31.950
to get to their other refueling chopper, but
it’s okay as they won’t be able to leave

00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:34.289
that station until the storm passes.

00:18:34.289 --> 00:18:38.669
When the storm passes we can radio out our
warning to the world, before they can take

00:18:38.669 --> 00:18:39.799
the chopper home.

00:18:39.799 --> 00:18:44.190
Juliette sides with Kate, and shows her where
the snowcat keys are so she can hide them

00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:47.450
and prevent the crew from leaving the base

00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:51.679
They both hurry into the storage closet, where
Kate thinks she’s going to find the keys,

00:18:51.679 --> 00:19:08.830
but actually, Juliette wants to get her alone
for a little striptease.

00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:11.570
* Kate nopes out of there with some slick
parkour moves.

00:19:11.570 --> 00:19:15.570
Seriously, can we just take a moment to commend
her for not tripping on a loose pencil or

00:19:15.570 --> 00:19:18.789
can of beans during her escape.

00:19:18.789 --> 00:19:23.730
Blondie doesn’t share Kate’s quick reactions
and gets rekted before his brain can process,

00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:27.669
“Monster close, me, in danger.”

00:19:27.669 --> 00:19:32.190
Lars shows up with the flamethrower, which
is good thinking since we know the alien cells

00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:35.039
and pathogens are susceptible to intense heat.

00:19:35.039 --> 00:19:38.850
* Wait, why the hell do research scientists
have a flamethrower?

00:19:38.850 --> 00:19:43.470
On Quora, a first hand account answered that
they couldn’t find flamethrowers in the

00:19:43.470 --> 00:19:47.420
U.S. Antarctic Program’s material and maintenance
tracking software.

00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:50.659
I know this isn’t a U.S. station, but I
think it’s still relevant.

00:19:50.659 --> 00:19:53.270
I guess it’s just because it’s cool.

00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:58.230
Lars torches the thing, but it intelligently
uses the fire sprinklers to extinguish the

00:19:58.230 --> 00:19:59.230
flames.

00:19:59.230 --> 00:20:02.850
A couple more blasts from the flamethrower
helps to cook the alien through, until it

00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:03.859
drops dead.

00:20:03.859 --> 00:20:07.179
The crew takes the thing outside to a ditch,
douses it in kerosene, and lights it on fire

00:20:07.179 --> 00:20:09.570
again, just to be sure it’s fully dead.

00:20:09.570 --> 00:20:13.379
* The doubletap is a smart move, as you can
never be too sure it’s dead.

00:20:13.379 --> 00:20:18.299
While this creature is seemingly lifeless,
the pathogen could have infected and assimilated

00:20:18.299 --> 00:20:22.850
anyone else in the group.

00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:26.879
* Since everybody is now taking the situation
seriously, what can we do?

00:20:26.879 --> 00:20:29.679
We need to test who is a thing and who isn’t.

00:20:29.679 --> 00:20:33.720
* Lars is the most unlikely person to be the
thing, since he torched it.

00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:38.460
Keep everyone outside in the huddle further
than arm's length preferably, with Lars guarding

00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:40.100
them with the flamethrower.

00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:44.980
Have Kate, the second most unlikely person
to be the thing, go get enough petri dishes

00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:50.039
and sharp objects for each person in the group,
as well as bring a microscope back outside

00:20:50.039 --> 00:20:51.039
to the group.

00:20:51.039 --> 00:20:55.129
Hand out the sharp objects and petri dishes
to each person, with the instruction to extract

00:20:55.129 --> 00:20:56.129
a blood sample.

00:20:56.129 --> 00:20:59.521
Then have everyone return their samples back
to Kate and Lars.

00:20:59.521 --> 00:21:05.640
Have Kate inspect the samples to determine
who is a thing, then, well, you know what

00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:13.440
to do.

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:17.820
They decide to split up so some of the crew
can get test kits and the others can disable

00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:19.100
the vehicles.

00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:23.570
Splitting up is not a good idea, once you
lose visual contact you can’t determine

00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:25.269
if the other’s have been assimilated.

00:21:25.269 --> 00:21:26.760
I like my idea better.

00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:31.230
Kate goes off with Lars to disable the vehicles,
then he shows her a stash of incendiary grenades

00:21:31.230 --> 00:21:32.230
he’s been hoarding.

00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:35.730
* Damn, Lars has a flamethrower and incendiary
grenades.

00:21:35.730 --> 00:21:38.720
I like this guy, I’ll take 2 or 3 please.

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:45.990
Derek and Sam from the helicopter crash show
up.

00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:54.679
* Or, we could just test their blood like
we were going to do already.

00:21:54.679 --> 00:21:58.529
* It might also be a good idea for Lars to
top that flamethrower off.

00:21:58.529 --> 00:22:02.929
It looks like a type of WW2 flamethrower,
which typically only holds enough fuel to

00:22:02.929 --> 00:22:04.879
fire for 7-10 seconds.

00:22:04.879 --> 00:22:08.169
He probably used up most of the fuel at his
first barbecue.

00:22:08.169 --> 00:22:13.529
Some of the crew members find that the lab
is on fire, and all the test kits were destroyed,

00:22:13.529 --> 00:22:16.159
probably sabotaged by the thing.

00:22:16.159 --> 00:22:20.320
* Hmm, maybe Kate should have been the only
one to get the kits while Lars guarded the

00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:23.090
remaining people, like in my strategy.

00:22:23.090 --> 00:22:28.230
* Great, now we are reduced to checking people’s
mouths up close with a flashlight looking

00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:29.539
for fillings.

00:22:29.539 --> 00:22:34.059
This method is trash because as soon as you
realize it’s the thing, their tongue will

00:22:34.059 --> 00:22:37.659
turn into a tentacle and suck your face into
their mass of flesh.

00:22:37.659 --> 00:22:42.509
It’s also unreliable, I mean what if someone
just had great dental hygiene and didn’t

00:22:42.509 --> 00:22:45.559
need fillings.

00:22:45.559 --> 00:22:50.450
They separate the flossers from the fillings,
and send Lars to bring Derek and Carter for

00:22:50.450 --> 00:22:52.279
their dental inspection.

00:22:52.279 --> 00:22:56.440
Lars gets mauled by something while trying
to find the Americans by himself.

00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:58.649
* Damnit Lars, I liked you man.

00:22:58.649 --> 00:23:03.720
Panic and distrust ensues once the group learns
that Lars went missing right when the Americans

00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:05.629
escaped and showed up.

00:23:05.629 --> 00:23:15.330
Derek ends the standoff with a Mozambique
triple tap.

00:23:15.330 --> 00:23:20.219
Carter and Derek are Vietnam war veterans,
they don’t fuck around in these situations.

00:23:20.219 --> 00:23:23.779
* Unfortunately, the flamethrower was destroyed
in the shootout.

00:23:23.779 --> 00:23:26.960
But fortunately, Sam found another flamethrower.

00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:29.690
Where the hell is everyone getting flamethrowers
from, is there an armory around or something.

00:23:29.690 --> 00:23:32.169
Edvard nearly gets blown up by the damaged
flamethrower, so they take him to the rec

00:23:32.169 --> 00:23:36.889
room to continue their game of Guess Who,
and well, let’s just say it’s not hard

00:23:36.889 --> 00:23:48.489
to guess who the thing is anymore.

00:23:48.489 --> 00:23:52.519
Of course the fucking flamethrower doesn’t
work, or, it’s out of fuel.

00:23:52.519 --> 00:23:56.899
* If that was Lar’s flamethrower that they
stole, like we talked about earlier, it was

00:23:56.899 --> 00:23:58.309
probably out of fuel.

00:23:58.309 --> 00:24:00.299
All hell is now breaking loose.

00:24:00.299 --> 00:24:06.229
Derek pathetically attempts to kill it with
more 9mm fire from his Walther P38, which

00:24:06.229 --> 00:24:11.039
has no effect, before getting whacked by the
tentacle.

00:24:11.039 --> 00:24:16.850
* Honestly, knowing what we know from the
first encounter, bullets have minimal effect.

00:24:16.850 --> 00:24:19.590
The best course of option is to use a flamethrower
or grenade.

00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:22.039
If you don’t have those, then just run.

00:24:22.039 --> 00:24:27.389
* It’s also important to realize that anyone
who got tentacled is now infected by the pathogen,

00:24:27.389 --> 00:24:29.029
and could start to attack you.

00:24:29.029 --> 00:24:34.090
Adam Finch’s death is one of the more fucked
up ones, with the thing fusing and assimilating

00:24:34.090 --> 00:24:43.370
him while he’s alive.

00:24:43.370 --> 00:24:46.480
* I think Peder got off easy with the bullet
to the brain.

00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:49.830
Kate gets the flamethrower working, and gets
a good look at poor Tormund.

00:24:49.830 --> 00:24:59.490
It’s not giant's milk he’s drinking tonight.

00:24:59.490 --> 00:25:01.719
Kate mercy kills him with the flamethrower.

00:25:01.719 --> 00:25:06.200
* You know the situation is bad when getting
flamethrowered is a mercy killing.

00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:08.130
She roasts Derek’s body too.

00:25:08.130 --> 00:25:11.470
* Seriously though, that flamethrower has
to be out of fuel by now.

00:25:11.470 --> 00:25:16.830
You need to either go get more fuel and those
incendiary grenades, or pick another flamethrower

00:25:16.830 --> 00:25:18.370
off the flamethrower tree.

00:25:18.370 --> 00:25:24.159
Sam and Kate team up while Sanders hides like
a bitch.

00:25:24.159 --> 00:25:31.340
* I never liked Sanders, because he basically
caused this mess, but it’s hard to see him

00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:32.450
go out like this.

00:25:32.450 --> 00:25:36.980
A facehugger ambushes them, but Carter cuts
it in half with his fireman's axe.

00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:38.559
* Great, now there’s two of them.

00:25:38.559 --> 00:25:43.139
They should’ve expected that an axe wouldn’t
work on the thing, as it regularly performs

00:25:43.139 --> 00:25:48.350
a kind of mitosis and rapid cellular transformation,
but what else are you gonna do?

00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:53.070
It did seem like it injured it temporarily
though.

00:25:53.070 --> 00:25:56.220
Kate torches the hand centipede thing.

00:25:56.220 --> 00:25:59.159
* Good on Kate for warning Carter of picking
the axe back up.

00:25:59.159 --> 00:26:03.480
It’s not crazy to assume that the blood
could form into a mini bug thing and infect

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:04.480
him.

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:08.299
For all we know, one virion might be all it
takes to infect and assimilate a person.

00:26:08.299 --> 00:26:13.250
Kate and Sam look for Sanders-thing, and attempt
to clear the base of the thing.

00:26:13.250 --> 00:26:16.159
* Clearing the base right now is exceptionally
dangerous.

00:26:16.159 --> 00:26:19.239
There could be more facehuggers that could
jump out at you from anywhere.

00:26:19.239 --> 00:26:23.960
The smaller ones are arguably more dangerous
as they are faster, sneakier, and harder to

00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:29.779
hit.

00:26:29.779 --> 00:26:31.879
.
* The big one’s no slouch though, as all

00:26:31.879 --> 00:26:35.059
it takes is one whip from it’s tentacle
and you’re done.

00:26:35.059 --> 00:26:37.899
The best move is probably to retreat to the
grenade shed.

00:26:37.899 --> 00:26:41.649
You’ll have more firepower to deal with
the thing, the element of surprise if the

00:26:41.649 --> 00:26:47.089
thing enters the shed, and one point of entry
that you can guard.

00:26:47.089 --> 00:26:55.809
* Yep, bet you’re wishing you retreated
to the grenade shed instead.

00:26:55.809 --> 00:26:58.279
Carter and Kate get separated in the chaos.

00:26:58.279 --> 00:27:02.580
Carter grabbing pots, pans, and kitchen knives
to fight with is comically desperate.

00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:04.960
Getting back to Kate asap is his only chance.

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:10.190
* I gotta say, it’s refreshing that he didn’t
accidentally knock over some Campbells soup.

00:27:10.190 --> 00:27:12.859
It doesn’t matter though, he got backed
into a corner.

00:27:12.859 --> 00:27:17.519
The thing spots him, but before Carter gets
absorbed into the meat monstrosity, Kate comes

00:27:17.519 --> 00:27:19.249
in hot with the flamethrower.

00:27:19.249 --> 00:27:24.500
She uses up the rest of what appeared to be
a bottomless supply of flame juice in a fit

00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:33.860
of rage, at least it seems like it.

00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:39.029
* It’s pretty understandable that in that
situation you’d squeeze and hold the trigger

00:27:39.029 --> 00:27:42.840
until the thing was ashes, but it’s a costly
mistake.

00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:47.700
Sanders obviously got rekted earlier, so there
is still a Sanders-thing to contend with,

00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:51.109
possibly also dog-thing and Lars-thing as
well.

00:27:51.109 --> 00:27:54.380
The flamethrower is the only effective weapon
they have.

00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:57.729
They spot Sanders-thing making a break for
it in the snowcat.

00:27:57.729 --> 00:28:01.090
I’m not sure how, I thought Kate and Lars
disabled all the vehicles.

00:28:01.090 --> 00:28:02.090
Maybe they only unplugged the batteries, not
realizing the thing’s level of intelligence

00:28:02.090 --> 00:28:09.059
and access to memories which it can use to
restart the vehicle.

00:28:09.059 --> 00:28:10.169
* I’m with Kate.

00:28:10.169 --> 00:28:14.989
The thing likely retains the neuron structure
of the victim, so the thing could retain knowledge

00:28:14.989 --> 00:28:20.139
of other research stations, like the Halley
station, which has a functioning helicopter.

00:28:20.139 --> 00:28:22.749
If we let it leave, it could spread to the
rest of the world.

00:28:22.749 --> 00:28:23.749
It must be stopped.

00:28:23.749 --> 00:28:25.630
Kate grabs some nades to bring along for the
ride.

00:28:25.630 --> 00:28:30.340
* I love the exchange when Carter see’s
Kate stuffing nades into her jacket, and he’s

00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:32.480
just like, aight cool, let's head out.

00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:35.710
There’s no stupid dialogue of, ‘where
the hell did you get those.’

00:28:35.710 --> 00:28:39.720
He doesn’t give a shit how she got them,
only that they are a welcome addition.

00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:43.909
Once the two get on the road, Kate and Carter
suspiciously check each other out.

00:28:43.909 --> 00:28:45.559
She sees he’s still wearing an earring.

00:28:45.559 --> 00:28:49.210
* I’m kind of skeptical of using this as
proof he’s not a thing.

00:28:49.210 --> 00:28:54.019
Sure, the thing can’t replicate the ear
piercing, but once formed it could pierce

00:28:54.019 --> 00:28:55.789
it’s ear in order to blend in.

00:28:55.789 --> 00:28:59.359
Fillings make more sense, as you can’t put
a filling back in.

00:28:59.359 --> 00:29:02.549
Given the circumstances, it’s decent reassurance
though.

00:29:02.549 --> 00:29:07.749
Kate inquires about Lars’s disappearance,
but Carter says he had nothing to do with

00:29:07.749 --> 00:29:08.749
it.

00:29:08.749 --> 00:29:12.409
* I guess they judged the direction Sander’s
was going in and realized he was heading to

00:29:12.409 --> 00:29:15.179
the spacecraft, not a nearby station.

00:29:15.179 --> 00:29:19.519
This thing is trying to fire up the spacecraft,
which I'm confused about.

00:29:19.519 --> 00:29:21.109
* Why didn’t it do that earlier.

00:29:21.109 --> 00:29:26.100
* Also, virions can’t retain the knowledge
necessary to operate a spacecraft, the thing

00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:30.509
should be limited to the intelligence of the
victim it’s imitating since it replicates

00:29:30.509 --> 00:29:35.529
their brain structure, generally speaking.

00:29:35.529 --> 00:29:36.950
Whatever.

00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:39.330
* Did she just fall into the engine or something?

00:29:39.330 --> 00:29:43.669
At least the thing was dumb enough to leave
the spaceships entrance open for Carter.

00:29:43.669 --> 00:29:49.330
* Do you ever find yourself in a peculiar
situation, and wonder, how did I get here.

00:29:49.330 --> 00:29:53.370
What series of decisions did I make, which
led me to this point.

00:29:53.370 --> 00:29:58.210
* That’s what Carter is most likely thinking
to himself, as he wanders an alien spaceship

00:29:58.210 --> 00:30:02.200
with a world war 2 flamethrower in search
of a spaghetti monster.

00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:07.340
While Kate gets mesmerized by an alien hologram
thing, Sander’s, in his final form, sneaks

00:30:07.340 --> 00:30:27.499
up on her.

00:30:27.499 --> 00:30:31.169
* The thing could have detached an arm to
create a facehugger, which she would have

00:30:31.169 --> 00:30:32.520
no way of fighting off.

00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:35.239
I don’t know why I'm trying to help the
thing.

00:30:35.239 --> 00:30:37.369
It might make for an interesting video though.

00:30:37.369 --> 00:30:41.269
If I was the thing, how would I beat the humans?

00:30:41.269 --> 00:30:43.559
Let me know in the comments if you like that
idea.

00:30:43.559 --> 00:30:48.499
Just before she gets pulled into the open
by Sanders-thing, she grabs the thermite nade.

00:30:48.499 --> 00:30:53.609
* Kate misses an opportunity to drop a one-liner,
like, “Eat this”, after she lobs the nade

00:30:53.609 --> 00:30:56.419
into the things' suckhole.

00:30:56.419 --> 00:31:02.119
* See, that’s how it’s done.

00:31:02.119 --> 00:31:04.309
Carter shows up in time for the fireworks.

00:31:04.309 --> 00:31:09.090
* A bit Hollywood with the explosion, thermite
nades actually just burn through things like

00:31:09.090 --> 00:31:12.639
a 5000 degree sparkler.

00:31:12.639 --> 00:31:15.749
You don’t wanna be hand-holding this sparkler,
that’s for sure.

00:31:15.749 --> 00:31:18.289
Carter suggests going to a nearby Russian
station.

00:31:18.289 --> 00:31:22.379
* It’s kind of hard to see, but Carter’s
not wearing his earring anymore.

00:31:22.379 --> 00:31:24.879
It’s possible he is a thing now.

00:31:24.879 --> 00:31:28.879
It could have been lost in the tussle, but
we have to be extra cautious with him.

00:31:28.879 --> 00:31:33.229
I think Kate knows this too, I don’t think
she’s subtly glancing over at him because

00:31:33.229 --> 00:31:34.229
he’s cute.

00:31:34.229 --> 00:31:37.350
His suggestion to go to another station is
suspicious too.

00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:38.350
Yep.

00:31:38.350 --> 00:31:42.139
Kate grabs the flamethrower baits him by bringing
up his missing earring.

00:31:42.139 --> 00:31:46.139
When he goes to touch his ear to feel for
the missing earring, he touches the wrong

00:31:46.139 --> 00:31:47.139
ear.

00:31:47.139 --> 00:31:50.989
* It seems like a clever play by Kate, but
Carter should’ve retained the memory of

00:31:50.989 --> 00:31:52.340
his earring placement.

00:31:52.340 --> 00:31:56.969
I mean, Sanders-thing remembered how to start
up a fucking spaceship from memories contained

00:31:56.969 --> 00:31:58.479
within it’s virions.

00:31:58.479 --> 00:32:02.519
* Besides the missing earring, the other thing
that damns him, is that when he showed up

00:32:02.519 --> 00:32:06.659
and the thing was about to kill Kate, he didn’t
use the flamethrower on it.

00:32:06.659 --> 00:32:10.701
It didn’t look like he saw her lob the grenade
into its mouth either, so he doesn’t have

00:32:10.701 --> 00:32:13.179
an excuse to not have opened up on it.

00:32:13.179 --> 00:32:16.730
Carter-thing pleads for it’s life in a last
attempt to deceive Kate.

00:32:16.730 --> 00:32:24.940
But Kate’s an absolute fucking savage.

00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:29.029
* Judging by the weird screaming sounds, Carter
was most likely a thing.

00:32:29.029 --> 00:32:32.600
Kate hops into the spare snowcat without checking
the backseat.

00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:34.549
* Come on, always check the backseat.

00:32:34.549 --> 00:32:37.489
Did we forget about facehuggers all of the
sudden.

00:32:37.489 --> 00:32:38.979
The movie ends.

00:32:38.979 --> 00:32:43.820
* Kate needs to make contact with other stations
to get the word out, and secure the pathogen

00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:44.820
and spaceship.

00:32:44.820 --> 00:32:45.820
* It’s risky to go to another station in
person, as we don’t know the extent of the

00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:46.820
pathogen's abilities.

00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:47.820
We could be infected, but the pathogen might
not attack and replicate the rest of our body

00:32:47.820 --> 00:32:48.820
until it’s safer for it to do so, meaning
we wouldn’t be able to detect it, even with

00:32:48.820 --> 00:32:49.820
a blood sample.

00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:50.820
* We can’t chill at the base and wait for
the storm to pass before radioing out, as

00:32:50.820 --> 00:32:54.249
the Lars-thing and Dog-thing could easily
kill us, or make it to another station before

00:32:54.249 --> 00:32:55.480
the storm passes.

00:32:55.480 --> 00:33:00.570
* Kate needs to go to the russian station
in person, right away, so she can warn them.

00:33:00.570 --> 00:33:04.419
Obviously she’d want to self-quarantine
and fully checked out once help arrives.

00:33:04.419 --> 00:33:08.510
* If we can swing it, the most effective way
to clean this mess up is to nuke the site

00:33:08.510 --> 00:33:13.120
from orbit.

00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:15.360
* But it’s probably hard to get approval
for.

00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:19.190
With Kate’s help, the rest of the world
could help establish containment and begin

00:33:19.190 --> 00:33:20.669
studying the ship.

00:33:20.669 --> 00:33:25.769
* Despite torching the things, there are probably
still active cells and virions, so this place

00:33:25.769 --> 00:33:27.049
is still a hot-zone.

00:33:27.049 --> 00:33:31.450
Since it’d be hard to convince the world
to nuke the research station, trying to manually

00:33:31.450 --> 00:33:37.009
contain this pathogen could still fail and
result in unimaginable amounts of death and

00:33:37.009 --> 00:33:38.009
destruction.

00:33:38.009 --> 00:33:41.279
In conclusion, I think that we could have
prevented the thing’s massacre with a bit

00:33:41.279 --> 00:33:43.519
of caution and PPE.

00:33:43.519 --> 00:33:49.200
But I also think that there were a lot of
pivotal moments where the crew could’ve

00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:52.419
made better decisions which would have stopped
the thing and saved lives.

00:33:52.419 --> 00:33:53.809
What do you think?

00:33:53.809 --> 00:33:55.489
How would you have beat The Thing?

00:33:55.489 --> 00:33:56.849
Let me know in the comments.

00:33:56.849 --> 00:33:57.849
Thanks for watching.

00:33:57.849 --> 00:34:01.509
And remember, don’t finger alien corpses
with sandwich gloves.
