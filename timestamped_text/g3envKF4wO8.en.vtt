00:00:06.734 --> 00:00:07.950
hey what's up guys

00:00:08.142 --> 00:00:12.238
today I'll show you a supernatural mystery thriller film: "Odd Thomas"

00:00:12.494 --> 00:00:15.246
spoiler ahead, watch out and take care

00:00:15.566 --> 00:00:18.382
Odd Thomas was born in a small town in California

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.350
his mother is a psychic who is put in a psychiatric hospital

00:00:22.478 --> 00:00:24.654
for people believe she has a mental disease

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.022
Thomas has the same power as his mother

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.118
in order to protect himself, Thomas hides his ability from others

00:00:31.374 --> 00:00:34.958
with time passing by, his psychic power grows stronger

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.774
Thomas is not scared of what he is capable of

00:00:37.966 --> 00:00:41.934
he thinks his power is a blessing, and often uses it to help the lingering dead

00:00:42.254 --> 00:00:45.774
one day, he meets a young girl's spirit, who was murdered

00:00:45.902 --> 00:00:48.334
the spirit leads him to a car parked at the roadside

00:00:48.654 --> 00:00:50.830
it turns out the driver is the murderer

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.734
Thomas pulls his car key, and beats him up for the poor girl

00:00:55.182 --> 00:00:59.086
in most people's eyes, Thomas is an odd boy who likes to make trouble

00:00:59.342 --> 00:01:02.478
but for those innocent ghosts, he is very kind-hearted

00:01:02.734 --> 00:01:05.934
Thomas always captures the murderer before the police do

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.454
a detective who knows Thomas well, appreciates his help

00:01:09.646 --> 00:01:13.934
so every time he would make a false confession, to help Thomas cover his power

00:01:14.254 --> 00:01:17.518
one night, Thomas has a bad dream of being surrounded 

00:01:17.646 --> 00:01:19.694
by a bunch of faceless people in bowling shirts

00:01:20.014 --> 00:01:22.830
suddenly, a gunman appears, and shoots them all

00:01:23.022 --> 00:01:24.878
those faceless people cry for help

00:01:24.942 --> 00:01:26.798
one of them carries Thomas home

00:01:27.118 --> 00:01:32.302
the next day, Thomas wakes up in his bed, and realizes it is a warning of how he dies

00:01:32.622 --> 00:01:36.270
ghosts can't talk, so Thomas doesn't know much about the details

00:01:36.526 --> 00:01:39.726
growing up without parents, Thomas lives a simple life

00:01:39.918 --> 00:01:42.094
he is a chef in a fast-food restaurant

00:01:42.286 --> 00:01:46.382
the owner of the restaurant likes him, because of his excellent cooking skill

00:01:46.574 --> 00:01:49.262
he is in a relationship with a girl he grew up with

00:01:49.518 --> 00:01:51.758
Thomas can see not only humans' spirits

00:01:51.886 --> 00:01:55.406
but also evil creatures called bodachs, that feed on carnage

00:01:55.726 --> 00:01:58.926
if they gather somewhere, it means there will be a disaster

00:01:59.182 --> 00:02:02.574
long ago, Thomas had a friend who was also a psychic

00:02:02.766 --> 00:02:04.494
bodachs found that he could see them

00:02:04.622 --> 00:02:07.438
they then possessed a driver, and hit him with a car

00:02:07.694 --> 00:02:10.894
when Thomas sees some bodachs wandering around in the restaurant

00:02:11.086 --> 00:02:14.734
he calms himself down, and observes them without being discovered

00:02:14.862 --> 00:02:19.086
every time a bodach approaches his girlfriend, he would cleverly interfere

00:02:19.214 --> 00:02:22.734
soon a bodach is suspicious of him, and stares at him closely

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:27.086
though scared, Thomas continues his work, pretending that he doesn't see it

00:02:27.342 --> 00:02:29.902
more and more bodachs gather in the restaurant

00:02:30.286 --> 00:02:32.206
Thomas knows that killing is coming

00:02:32.398 --> 00:02:34.062
lots of people are going to die

00:02:34.254 --> 00:02:36.942
when he finished work, he wants to follow the bodachs

00:02:37.134 --> 00:02:41.230
but is stopped by a friend called Viola, who is a single mother with two kids

00:02:41.486 --> 00:02:45.966
she tells Thomas she has been having bad dreams, and hopes Thomas can help her

00:02:46.222 --> 00:02:50.062
she also dreams about faceless people, wearing red bowling shirts

00:02:50.318 --> 00:02:51.726
he doesn't tell her the truth

00:02:51.854 --> 00:02:54.606
he just asks her to relax, and it will be fine

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:56.590
having said goodbye to Viola

00:02:56.782 --> 00:03:00.558
Thomas continues to track down the bodachs with his psychic magnetism

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.718
he comes to a shopping mall, and sees his girlfriend who is on working there

00:03:05.038 --> 00:03:06.958
his girlfriend knows about his power

00:03:07.022 --> 00:03:11.374
although she can't see ghosts, she is happy to help Thomas gather information

00:03:11.566 --> 00:03:15.022
Thomas notices some bodachs hovering over a man with yellow hair

00:03:15.278 --> 00:03:17.774
Thomas gives the man the nickname Fungus Bob

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.230
Fungus Bob leaves the mall with two tubs of ice cream

00:03:21.358 --> 00:03:24.302
the bodachs stop following him, and return to hell

00:03:24.686 --> 00:03:27.118
according to what Thomas knows about bodachs

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.190
they will not leave until the killing and harm are finished

00:03:30.382 --> 00:03:34.670
feeling strange, Thomas follows Fungus Bob to a house outside of the city

00:03:34.926 --> 00:03:39.854
when Fungus Bob leaves the house, Thomas breaks in, and is attracted by a wooden door

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:44.142
the resentment coming behind the door, is so strong that it almost freezes the air

00:03:44.526 --> 00:03:47.790
Thomas walks into that door, and finds a passage to hell

00:03:48.046 --> 00:03:53.166
sensing the danger, he runs out of the room immediately, and hides behind another door

00:03:53.486 --> 00:03:56.494
soon countless bodachs storm out of the room through the passage

00:03:56.814 --> 00:03:59.182
Thomas holds his breath, and stays still

00:03:59.438 --> 00:04:01.870
he calls his girlfriend when the bodachs all leave

00:04:01.934 --> 00:04:04.494
and returns to that room that is back to normal

00:04:04.686 --> 00:04:08.974
on the wall, Thomas sees lots of pictures and newspaper cuttings about murders

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.022
through the files he finds in the room

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.670
he realizes Fungus Bob is planning a terrorist attack tomorrow

00:04:14.862 --> 00:04:17.806
Fungus Bob's accomplice appears outside of the house

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.070
Thomas escapes through a window before he is discovered

00:04:21.262 --> 00:04:22.990
to stop the attack from happening

00:04:23.182 --> 00:04:26.510
Thomas tells the detective what he found in Fungus Bob's house

00:04:26.766 --> 00:04:30.478
the detective trusts him and assigns a new officer to investigate right away 

00:04:30.606 --> 00:04:32.974
because Thomas's warning is always right

00:04:33.294 --> 00:04:36.878
later that day, Thomas meets his girlfriend for dinner in a church

00:04:37.262 --> 00:04:39.758
he sees Fungus Bob coming to them angrily

00:04:40.014 --> 00:04:43.726
so he closes the gate and hides in the sacristy with his girlfriend

00:04:43.982 --> 00:04:47.374
Fungus Bob breaks into the church and destroys the sacristy

00:04:47.758 --> 00:04:51.150
Thomas escapes with his girlfriend and informs the detective

00:04:51.278 --> 00:04:54.158
hoping the detective can keep an eye on Fungus Bob

00:04:54.478 --> 00:04:58.894
later, Thomas comes to a bowling alley under the lead of his psychic magnetism

00:04:59.214 --> 00:05:03.246
the staff here are wearing the same shirts as the faceless people in his dream

00:05:03.438 --> 00:05:05.358
he calls the detective immediately

00:05:05.486 --> 00:05:07.918
the detective sends officer Simon there 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:12.206
Simon doesn't know Thomas has a special ability and thinks it is a prank

00:05:12.334 --> 00:05:14.894
without a choice, Thomas ignores the officer

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.734
he then comes to Viola's house and asks her to recall her dream

00:05:18.926 --> 00:05:21.934
he sees a vague scene through contacting Viola

00:05:22.126 --> 00:05:25.262
but he can't figure out where the attack is going to happen

00:05:25.646 --> 00:05:26.798
time is getting short

00:05:26.926 --> 00:05:29.678
Thomas suggests Viola leave the town immediately

00:05:29.934 --> 00:05:32.366
when driving home, Thomas stops halfway 

00:05:32.494 --> 00:05:35.822
and wanna give a tongue massage to appease his worrying girlfriend

00:05:36.014 --> 00:05:38.126
right then, they hear a woman screaming

00:05:38.318 --> 00:05:40.046
Thomas rushes towards the woman

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:43.758
but when he finds her, the woman is killed by a bald man by accident

00:05:44.014 --> 00:05:48.878
the bald man explains to the police that he saw the woman was chased and attacked by dogs

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:52.398
he wanted to shoot the dog, but he shot the woman by accident

00:05:52.718 --> 00:05:54.766
those dogs are kept by Fungus Bob

00:05:55.086 --> 00:05:58.030
so the detective gives an order to capture Fungus Bob

00:05:58.158 --> 00:06:01.358
before leaving, Thomas gives the detective a metal pendant

00:06:01.742 --> 00:06:04.494
he dreams that an accident is going to happen to the detective

00:06:04.622 --> 00:06:06.478
and the pendant can protect him

00:06:06.734 --> 00:06:09.614
Thomas returns home and finds a gun on the floor

00:06:09.934 --> 00:06:12.494
Fungus Bob is shot dead in his bathtub

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:15.950
Thomas realizes somebody wants to frame him for the murder

00:06:16.206 --> 00:06:17.998
he recalls what happened before 

00:06:18.126 --> 00:06:22.030
and discovered the one that chased him at the church was Fungus Bob's spirit

00:06:22.414 --> 00:06:25.486
in fact, Fungus Bob has been dead for a while

00:06:25.806 --> 00:06:30.350
Thomas moves the body to an abandoned prison and hides it in a gas chamber

00:06:30.542 --> 00:06:34.446
on his way back, he sees countless bodachs running around in the town

00:06:34.638 --> 00:06:37.390
he has never seen so many bodachs in his life

00:06:37.646 --> 00:06:39.566
he is absolutely terrified

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:43.086
in the meantime, a hitman knocks at the detective's door 

00:06:43.214 --> 00:06:45.518
and shoots him as soon as he opens the door

00:06:45.774 --> 00:06:49.230
luckily the detective is wearing the pendant, so he escapes death

00:06:49.486 --> 00:06:52.366
while the detective is receiving treatment in a hospital

00:06:52.622 --> 00:06:54.542
Thomas returns to Fungus Bob's house 

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:58.830
and tries to find more information about his accomplices from the computer

00:06:59.022 --> 00:07:01.326
the movement in the fridge gets his attention

00:07:01.454 --> 00:07:05.230
to his shock, he finds some female's fingers and a skull in the fridge

00:07:05.422 --> 00:07:07.534
Thomas is going to call the police

00:07:07.726 --> 00:07:11.246
suddenly, Fungus Bob's spirit appears, and wants revenge on him

00:07:11.566 --> 00:07:13.998
Thomas jumps out of the window and escapes

00:07:14.254 --> 00:07:17.710
the house then explodes, with all the evidence burned to the ground

00:07:17.838 --> 00:07:20.398
Thomas has to find evidence elsewhere

00:07:20.526 --> 00:07:24.750
he goes back to Fungus Bob's body and finds a tattoo identical to Simon's 

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:29.614
the tattoo "POD" means "Prince of Darkness", representing worship towards the demon

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:33.134
Thomas rushes to the mall using his psychic magnetism

00:07:33.518 --> 00:07:36.206
all the staff in the monitoring Room are killed

00:07:36.462 --> 00:07:40.814
Thomas knocks the killer out with a baseball bat and takes the killer's mask off

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:45.294
to his surprise, the killer is not officer Simon but the new officer

00:07:45.678 --> 00:07:49.262
Thomas now realizes Fungus Bob has two accomplices

00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:51.438
their plan was interrupted by Thomas

00:07:51.566 --> 00:07:56.750
they killed Fungus Bob, who was tracked by Thomas, and attempted to get rid of the detective

00:07:56.942 --> 00:08:00.078
the new officer's girlfriend saw files about the attack

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:02.766
so they caused an accident and killed the girl

00:08:02.894 --> 00:08:05.454
bodachs don't hover over Simon and the new officer

00:08:05.582 --> 00:08:08.910
which means bodachs discovered Thomas's ability long ago

00:08:08.974 --> 00:08:10.766
they just played with him

00:08:10.894 --> 00:08:15.886
thinking that his girlfriend is still in the mall, Thomas grabs a gun and rushes into the mall

00:08:16.014 --> 00:08:20.302
where he sees Viola, who didn't leave the town, and the staff from the bowling alley

00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:22.286
his dream is to become real

00:08:22.478 --> 00:08:25.422
the door to hell suddenly opens on the roof of the mall

00:08:25.742 --> 00:08:29.582
bodachs climb out of the door and take up the whole mall in no time

00:08:29.966 --> 00:08:33.294
Thomas is looking for Simon and hears people screaming

00:08:33.486 --> 00:08:36.174
people rush to the gates, but all gates are closed 

00:08:36.430 --> 00:08:39.758
a masked gunman fires an automatic weapon at the crowd

00:08:40.078 --> 00:08:45.262
though bodachs try to stop him, Thomas manages to fires at the gunman and kills him

00:08:45.326 --> 00:08:49.422
after that, Thomas turns to the ice cream shop to check on his girlfriend

00:08:49.735 --> 00:08:52.231
he is relieved to see his girlfriend is unharmed

00:08:52.487 --> 00:08:54.663
before he can reunite with his girlfriend

00:08:54.727 --> 00:08:59.399
he sees the new officer's dead girlfriend is calling at him, and the bodachs are still here

00:08:59.719 --> 00:09:02.023
Thomas realizes it is not over yet

00:09:02.151 --> 00:09:07.719
he then takes the gunman's mask off and finds he is the bald man who shot a woman by accident

00:09:07.911 --> 00:09:11.175
it turns out there are four members in Fungus Bob's team

00:09:11.175 --> 00:09:12.711
Simon is the leader

00:09:12.775 --> 00:09:16.103
Thomas follows the new officer's dead girlfriend to the parking lot 

00:09:16.295 --> 00:09:18.471
and discovers a van packed with explosives 

00:09:18.855 --> 00:09:22.759
a bodach possesses Simon who is leaving the lot, and makes him shoot at Thomas

00:09:22.951 --> 00:09:26.983
Thomas gets shot, but he still drives the van and leaves the mall

00:09:27.175 --> 00:09:30.695
Simon clings to the outside of the van and shoots at Thomas

00:09:30.951 --> 00:09:34.215
this time Thomas escapes the bullet and jumps out of the van

00:09:34.599 --> 00:09:37.543
the van crashes, and the explosion kills Simon

00:09:37.927 --> 00:09:40.871
later, Thomas awakens from his coma in a hospital

00:09:41.127 --> 00:09:43.431
his girlfriend has been keeping his company

00:09:43.495 --> 00:09:46.695
Thomas becomes famous for saving many people's lives

00:09:47.015 --> 00:09:50.151
but he enjoys more the hormone time spent with his girlfriend

00:09:50.407 --> 00:09:54.631
they have a great time together, enjoying food and watching Daniel CC movies

00:09:54.759 --> 00:09:57.511
which seem far better than their hormone games now

00:09:57.831 --> 00:10:01.415
one day, the detective and his wife knock at his door

00:10:01.479 --> 00:10:05.255
Thomas finally faces reality: his girlfriend was killed in the mall

00:10:05.383 --> 00:10:07.495
he is too sad to accept the truth

00:10:07.687 --> 00:10:10.375
his girlfriend only stays in this world for Thomas

00:10:10.567 --> 00:10:12.359
she doesn't want to see him alone

00:10:12.551 --> 00:10:15.111
though heart-broken, Thomas lets his girlfriend go

00:10:15.175 --> 00:10:18.311
he believes one day he will see his girlfriend again

00:10:18.503 --> 00:10:21.319
before that, he is going to fulfill his responsibility 

00:10:21.383 --> 00:10:23.367
to help the living and the lingering dead

00:10:24.263 --> 00:10:27.079
this's Daniel CC movie channel, peace out
