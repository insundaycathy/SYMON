00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:04.980
If you were a property developer who went
down to survey an old war bunker on your land,

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.820
only to find out it was built over an ancient
burial ground which cursed you with eternal

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.009
insanity, what would you do?

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:15.549
In this How to Beat video, we’ll follow
the property developers, see if we can make

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:20.130
better decisions, and ultimately attempt to
beat the Eternal Curse in, Gehenna: Where

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.230
Death Lives.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.429
If you think you could do better, leave a
comment letting me know how.

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:28.730
If you enjoy watching me dissect the actions
of cursed real estate agents, go ahead and

00:00:28.730 --> 00:01:53.460
hit those like and subscribe buttons.

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.840
We start out following some poor traveler
getting ritually defaced and buried alive.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.510
That’s why you gotta pack heat on your expeditions
to remote areas.

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.330
Never know what kind of twisted ass tribes
you might run into.

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.090
Nobody is suspicious about travelers disappearing
in Saipan.

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:09.090
Quite the opposite.

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.959
A group of developers are scouting it’s
beaches looking for a location to build their

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.959
new resort.

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:16.440
The Zillow listing initially looks great.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.079
Cheap beachfront property on a tropical island.

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:24.379
The catch is that it failed to mention anything
about burial grounds, sacrificial chambers,

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:25.769
or accursed lands.

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:28.730
The developers aren’t completely uninformed
though.

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.650
Their driver fills them in on the way to the
property.

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:37.319
It’s kind of late to back out now.

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:41.780
Who actually believes stories like Pet Sematary
or Indian Burial Grounds.

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.269
It’s all made up bullshit to keep people
off their land.

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:47.410
I’m not saying I wouldn’t still bring
a Glock 19 though.

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.909
When Pepe opens the car gate he notices that
one of the doll ornaments has fresh blood

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:52.909
on it.

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:56.079
Maybe someone is trying to scare them off
because they don’t want Mr. Monopoly to

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:58.389
build a giant tourist hotel in their backyard.

00:02:58.389 --> 00:03:02.239
Pepe neglects to say anything, not wanting
to be that ‘guy’.

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:06.069
While they are scouting the property with
their drone, they spot a couple indiges roaming

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:07.280
in the forest.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.280
Pepe exclaims that they must be headed to
the old Japanese World War 2 machine gun bunker.

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.810
Of course, if they want to build a Sandals
Resort here they’re going to need to check

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.790
out this war bunker to ensure it’s not going
to be looming over their bungalows.

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.860
The locals aren’t super friendly.

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:23.790
I’m not sure what happened to this guy.

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.090
Maybe he pissed off the ancient spirits.

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.849
I’m sure it’s just an animal or something.

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:36.420
As the developers who have to give the stamp
of approval for construction of the resort

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.140
here, they need to make sure this bunker isn’t
home to anything dangerous.

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.689
That doesn’t mean they need to go inside
right now.

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:47.790
It’s obvious something is down there and
they have no training, equipment, or weapons.

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.819
Alan’s visibly nervous and suggests sealing
the entrance with concrete.

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:55.650
Tyler says that they need to check it to make
sure it doesn’t run under the property which

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.709
might pose structural issues.

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:01.909
Both are valid suggestions, and I can see
how bringing in certified tunnel explorers

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:05.690
might be overkill if the bunker turns out
to be smaller than expected.

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:10.269
The crew crawls in and realizes that the bunker
is just an entry point to an extensive tunnel

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:11.269
network.

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:14.269
Tyler correctly states that they are not equipped
to survey and explore this.

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:19.610
Alan even throws in a complimentary excavation
of the entire bunker once payment is in escrow.

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:23.670
Just when they are about to make the sensible
decision, Paulina presses them onwards.

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:27.670
Calling in an expensive exploration and survey
job for something they might be able to do

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:29.950
themselves could jeopardize her promotion.

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:32.260
I think I’d pass and hang out on the beach
instead.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:36.700
I’m not sure why Alan and Pepe are tagging
along, they really don’t need to be a part

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:37.700
of this.

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:40.720
Tyler has the most pathetic flashlight I've
ever seen.

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.550
Looks like one of those $5 ones you get next
to the cash register at Wal-Mart.

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.280
I'm sure he didn’t pack spare batteries
and it will die once they get sufficiently

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.130
balls deep into this tunnel network.

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:54.450
There’s a lot of doors, a lot of corridors,
a lot of rooms, and they all look the same.

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:58.950
They really should be using some form of breadcrumbs
or makeshift line markers so they could retrace

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:02.050
their way back out if, when, they got lost.

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:06.120
The semi-good news is that Paulina’s boss
knows where they are and generally when he

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.640
should hear from her again.

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:13.660
If they get totally lost or trapped in a cave-in,
they will eventually be found.

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:18.120
It’s no use telling anybody about what you
heard.

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.530
They will think you’re hearing things and
push on with or without you.

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:23.910
And it’s far too late to turn back by yourself
now.

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:25.140
Basically, you’re fucked.

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:29.400
He might be able to incite enough dread in
Alan and Pepe to get them to go back outside

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:30.400
with him.

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.400
It’s worth a shot.

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.340
Of course, they’d be walking towards whatever
is stalking them.

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:38.850
It’s still better to face whatever it is
now than when you're deeper in the tunnels,

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:40.990
more lost, and out of flashlight battery.

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:44.190
Dave stomach’s his concerns and quickly
joins up with the pack.

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:46.490
You definitely don’t want to be in the back
of the group.

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:50.800
Paulina takes point and trips over the remains
of a Japanese soldier because they can’t

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.160
see shit with their Wal-Mart flashlights.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:57.010
No matter, corpses in old Japanese war bunkers
are to be expected.

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:59.230
She pushes them forward to continue surveying.

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:03.560
Paulina is really starting to remind me of
Scarlett in As Above, So Below.

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:05.660
Fearless when she should be fearful.

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:07.800
In the corridor ahead they find more bodies.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:12.810
What’s somewhat concerning about these bodies
is that one is a civilian female wearing post-war

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:13.810
clothing.

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:17.370
If she wasn’t down here during the war,
why was she down here afterwards and what

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:18.680
the hell did she die from?

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.360
It’s not a good picture being painted.

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:27.530
Uh that’s a hard fucking no.

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:29.370
Shut the door and leave.

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:31.690
Whatever this thing is, it wasn’t trapped
down here.

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:33.410
It could have left at any time.

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:35.810
It’s not on them to save whoever is down
here.

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:39.830
Alan can go ahead and call the concrete truck
to seal the entrance.

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:42.560
Jesus christ.

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:49.680
How do you go from being a real estate agent
on a beachfront property to fighting off grotesque

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:51.520
humanoids in old war bunkers.

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.820
Whatever you’re getting paid, it’s not
enough.

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:59.080
Paulina tries to hear out what the man-thing
has to say.

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:09.360
I’m going to come back to how it knew Alan’s
name in a second.

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:11.960
But first, bro, why are you being vengeful?

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:14.370
You came at Alan like a crazed lunatic.

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:16.620
What was he supposed to do, give you a fucking
hug.

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:18.410
Have you looked in a mirror recently?

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:21.210
You’re lucky Alan didn’t punch a hole
through your malnourished body.

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:22.680
Okay, the name thing.

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:25.210
It’s quite evident that Alan and this dude
weren’t pals.

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:28.280
Maybe it heard them call his name earlier,
but I doubt it.

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:30.860
The only other way is if the superstitions
were real.

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:34.200
At this point, you might as well assume the
worst and get the hell out.

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:37.300
If I was Alan, I'd be taking the next flight
out of Saipan.

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:42.200
Paulina in an act of egregious unnecessity
puts her face up to his to check if he’s

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:43.200
still breathing.

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:49.250
Who in their right mind would ever think to
do that.

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:53.650
Gee, who could have expected that.

00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:56.390
At least malnourished skeletors are easily
overpowered.

00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:57.390
He muttered, “your fault”.

00:07:57.390 --> 00:08:00.640
This dude is throwing mad accusations at people
he’s never met before.

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:04.680
They’re trying to build a nice resort with
infinity pools overlooking the ocean, and

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:06.990
Paulina was even kind enough to try to help
you.

00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:09.840
Not sure how whatever misfortune befell you
is their fault.

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:14.180
Alan tries to destroy the video evidence of
the altercation, thinking it implicates him

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:15.400
in some way.

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:20.390
What judge would watch this footage and not
think Alan’s actions were justified.

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:24.800
This unholy half-dead was already well past
the point of being savable anyways.

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:29.180
While Alan is struggling for the camera, the
old war bunker has a PTSD outburst of its

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:34.250
own.

00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:37.729
When they wake up, the lights are on, the
corpses including the man-thing are gone,

00:08:37.729 --> 00:08:39.870
and all the shelves were restocked with food.

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:43.930
It’s like they time traveled back to when
the bunker was in operation, and then side-stepped

00:08:43.930 --> 00:08:45.629
into the limbo hell variant.

00:08:45.629 --> 00:08:49.209
Maybe they got turned around, or the locals
are fucking with them and trying to scare

00:08:49.209 --> 00:08:52.579
them off with an extremely elaborate prank.

00:08:52.579 --> 00:08:56.410
Implausible, but way more believable than
getting sucked into another dimension.

00:08:56.410 --> 00:09:01.170
Everyone, including Paulina, is anxious to
leave the bunker now, but it’s too late.

00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:04.410
The door is sealed somehow, even though the
cross bar is unlocked.

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:08.630
Alan and Pepe split up from Paulina, Dave,
and Tyler to look for another exit.

00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:13.010
In their search, Alan and Pepe find a now
operational war radio that they might be able

00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:14.680
to use to call for help.

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:17.430
Optimistic, but it’s not like they have
a better option.

00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:20.670
Paulina’s group finds a much more foreboding
scene.

00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:28.709
A blood stained ground with a diary containing
a suicide note, and the man who wrote it.

00:09:28.709 --> 00:09:38.089
Okay Ashton Kutcher, you can come out now.

00:09:38.089 --> 00:09:41.110
We got Punk’d, this fake dead dude can get
up now.

00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:43.839
Please let us out of the old Japanese war
bunker.

00:09:43.839 --> 00:09:48.200
No hidden camera crew shows up and that soldier
is confirmed to be super dead.

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:52.460
It’s now dawning on them that something
incredibly sinister and supernatural is going

00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:53.460
on.

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:56.740
Alan hurries Tyler to the radio since he’s
the only one that understands Japanese.

00:09:56.740 --> 00:10:01.490
I’d have snagged that Nambu pistol on the
way out in case another malnourished freak

00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:02.920
charges at me again.

00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:07.899
Tyler radios for help, but the only response
is a repeating recorded message of an imperial

00:10:07.899 --> 00:10:13.139
order saying that civilians who commit suicide
are given the same spiritual status as soldiers

00:10:13.139 --> 00:10:14.459
who die in battle.

00:10:14.459 --> 00:10:15.459
Ominous.

00:10:15.459 --> 00:10:19.550
I’m with Paulina, let's try another frequency
before going down that route.

00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:23.579
Dave tries to calm himself down by getting
some ‘fresh air’ in the hallway after

00:10:23.579 --> 00:10:28.779
having a pistol shoved up to his head by a
World War 2 Japanese soldier moments ago.

00:10:28.779 --> 00:10:30.830
He doesn’t find any serenity.

00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:36.850
He starts hearing his name whispered to him
from the dark ends of the corridors.

00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:43.910
Either that PTSD is setting in quick, or you’re
in deep, deep shit.

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:50.680
Tyler tries the radio again and finally gets
a response.

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:53.249
He neglects to tell Paulina about that one.

00:10:53.249 --> 00:10:58.189
Everyone’s keeping their evil omens to themselves
so as to not cause panic or look weak.

00:10:58.189 --> 00:11:01.259
I think in these situations it’s best to
be forthright.

00:11:01.259 --> 00:11:05.440
The more everyone knows, the better their
chances at coming together and defeating whatever’s

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:06.440
after them.

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:09.449
Pepe, being the most superstitious of them
all, stays behind to pray.

00:11:09.449 --> 00:11:15.310
He notices that the soldier has one of those
dolls in his shoulder pocket.

00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:21.880
Pepe grabbing the knife to stick his spirit
mom with was a good call, but i’m not sure

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:24.200
physical weapons are going to be of any use
against them.

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:28.300
This might be one of those one’s where your
best weapon is protecting your mind against

00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:29.300
insanity.

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:33.199
The others are total assholes and leave Pepe
on their search for an exit.

00:11:33.199 --> 00:11:37.990
Another great reminder that exploring desolate
uncharted territories with people you don’t

00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:39.569
trust is a terrible idea.

00:11:39.569 --> 00:11:43.569
They start heading through an opening in the
bunker that leads downwards into a barren

00:11:43.569 --> 00:11:47.160
cave, which they themselves remark as not
being created by the Japanese.

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:53.459
Guys, if this wasn’t built by the Japanese,
it probably won’t lead to a potential secondary

00:11:53.459 --> 00:11:57.399
bunker entrance, especially since it’s taking
them deeper underground.

00:11:57.399 --> 00:12:00.639
Not that looking for a secondary exit would
matter at this point.

00:12:00.639 --> 00:12:02.529
They are already trapped and I think they
know it.

00:12:02.529 --> 00:12:04.970
This is an evil they are going to have to
face.

00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:07.990
In the next room there’s Bojobo dolls painted
on the walls.

00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:12.319
According to Dave, who did some handy brushing
up on Saipan’s history before arriving,

00:12:12.319 --> 00:12:15.300
these shitty drawings were the first Bojobo
dolls.

00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:19.970
Drawn by locals as depictions of their ancient
chief who was buried down here while colonists

00:12:19.970 --> 00:12:23.240
ravaged and tormented his bride and the Chamorro
people.

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:27.149
It’s said that the ancient chief is still
down here, alive.

00:12:27.149 --> 00:12:32.220
If you had come down here with a guide after
visiting the gift shop to buy fake $10 Bojobo

00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:36.069
dolls that were made in China, you’d have
no reason to give a shit or be concerned.

00:12:36.069 --> 00:12:40.009
After everything they’ve seen so far, they
should be taking this very seriously.

00:12:40.009 --> 00:12:43.730
My takeaway from this story is that they need
to go say hi and see if they can help him

00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:45.300
be reunited with his bride.

00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:49.279
He should be understanding that they had nothing
to do with that tragedy, and thankful that

00:12:49.279 --> 00:12:51.019
kind strangers lended aid.

00:12:51.019 --> 00:12:55.999
There should be no need for bloodshed or suffering.

00:12:55.999 --> 00:13:03.660
Or he’s just a twisted asshole.

00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:07.720
Ya know, there’s two sides to every story,
and I don’t believe your little sob love

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:08.720
version.

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:12.170
You and your wife were probably malevolent
tyrants that the Chamorro people begged the

00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:13.310
colonists to remove.

00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:17.209
Dave twisted his ankle so they carry him back
to the barracks to rest up.

00:13:17.209 --> 00:13:21.730
Alan and Tyler split off to continue searching
for clues, which is where they find Pepe.

00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:23.279
He’s not himself anymore.

00:13:23.279 --> 00:13:25.449
Alan really should have grabbed that pistol.

00:13:25.449 --> 00:13:27.439
Dave’s hallucinations are getting worse.

00:13:27.439 --> 00:13:31.209
I’m not sure if Paulina left or Dave entered
some alternate dimension where nobody can

00:13:31.209 --> 00:13:45.899
help him.

00:13:45.899 --> 00:13:50.339
Paulina is too busy Tik Tok’ing to notice
Dave choking himself to death until the last

00:13:50.339 --> 00:13:51.339
minute.

00:13:51.339 --> 00:13:53.949
As I suspected, these are demonic hallucinations.

00:13:53.949 --> 00:13:57.679
Everyone needs to stay close to physically
prevent each other from falling prey to the

00:13:57.679 --> 00:13:59.249
ancient chief’s tormentations.

00:13:59.249 --> 00:14:03.580
Dave’s last words before Paulina leaves
him again is that the Bojobo doll he picked

00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:07.819
up from the crazy man at the entrance was
the bride, and that they need to reunite it

00:14:07.819 --> 00:14:10.720
with the chief Bojobo doll for the curse to
be lifted.

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:14.120
Honestly, that’s their only option and it
sounds plausible.

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:28.019
They just need to stop bitching at each other
and hurry up before they all go insane.

00:14:28.019 --> 00:14:32.100
Alan can’t come to terms with his situation
and gets drawn back down to the cave by his

00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:33.509
ex-guide Pepe.

00:14:33.509 --> 00:14:41.199
Not a good place to be, especially by yourself
with only a lighter in your hand.

00:14:41.199 --> 00:14:45.480
Paulina is the last to start hallucinating,
and get’s suckered by some kid’s footsteps

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:46.779
into a back alley.

00:14:46.779 --> 00:14:51.660
Not just some kid, her kid who I'm guessing
died in some freak accident that Paulina’s

00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:52.910
loosely at fault for.

00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:56.610
How is it so hard for people to realize that
they are hallucinating?

00:14:56.610 --> 00:15:01.589
Why do they always get suckered by visions
of their dead loved ones in the most unbelievable

00:15:01.589 --> 00:15:02.589
situations?

00:15:02.589 --> 00:15:06.699
I can understand a mother running to her late
baby's room after ‘hearing’ it cry.

00:15:06.699 --> 00:15:11.490
What I can’t understand is that same thing
set in a cursed World War 2 bunker you’re

00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:16.879
trapped in.

00:15:16.879 --> 00:15:19.369
Tyler pulls Paulina out of it just as Alan
arrives.

00:15:19.369 --> 00:15:22.370
Then Tyler has one of the most insidious hallucinations.

00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:25.050
Not of a monster or a deceased child.

00:15:25.050 --> 00:15:30.019
He hears Alan say horrible things about Paulina,
things Alan never actually said.

00:15:30.019 --> 00:15:33.899
They finally come together as a team, realizing
that they are being pit against themselves

00:15:33.899 --> 00:15:34.899
and one another.

00:15:34.899 --> 00:15:38.910
They need to find that chief Bojobo doll before
they kill themselves like the Japanese soldiers

00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:39.910
did.

00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:41.740
Tall task in this giant sealed off bunker.

00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:45.019
Hopefully it’s still inside and not in some
other bunker a mile away.

00:15:45.019 --> 00:15:48.630
The Japanese soldiers killed by this curse
may have done something with it, so their

00:15:48.630 --> 00:15:51.540
diaries may hold clues as to its whereabouts.

00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:55.589
Sure enough, the soldiers had found the Bojobo
doll, Gehenna, and then all killed themselves

00:15:55.589 --> 00:15:56.589
and each other.

00:15:56.589 --> 00:15:58.709
The doll’s whereabouts are still unknown
though.

00:15:58.709 --> 00:16:05.500
Wait, is Dave still all alone?

00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:09.500
Tyler realizes that Dave killed himself with
a knife, the knife that Pepe had.

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:13.399
Is Pepe embodying the cursed spirits or did
Dave find another knife?

00:16:13.399 --> 00:16:16.550
Who knows, but Pepe is clearly playing for
the other team.

00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:20.179
To make matters worse, Tyler’s shitty flashlight
inevitably dies.

00:16:20.179 --> 00:16:24.300
Who knows when the lights will go out, and
with their hallucinations continuing to worsen,

00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:28.009
they need to get to that Bojobo doll ASAP
before they’re crawling on their hands and

00:16:28.009 --> 00:16:36.360
knees in the dark looking for it with evil
spirits jumpscaring them around every turn.

00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:40.190
Paulina and Tyler could be getting close,
they are at the location all the soldier’s

00:16:40.190 --> 00:16:41.350
bodies were dumped.

00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:45.889
One of them might have the chief’s Bojobo
doll, or unfortunately, it’s likely that

00:16:45.889 --> 00:16:47.600
it’s buried further down the tunnels.

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:50.470
Alan shows up and slips a knife into Tyler’s
gut.

00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:54.420
He isn’t waiting to get killed by the others
when they go crazy, he’s going to strike

00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:55.420
first.

00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:56.600
Dave was his first victim.

00:16:56.600 --> 00:17:01.019
It’s not a completely insane strategy, except
for the fact that you all are depending on

00:17:01.019 --> 00:17:04.640
each other to stay lucid enough to find and
marry both Bojobo dolls.

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:07.339
Paulina escapes down the tunnels where she
finds Pepe.

00:17:07.339 --> 00:17:09.360
He has the chief’s Bojobo doll.

00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:13.170
She convinces him that peace is an option
if they can tie the dolls together.

00:17:13.170 --> 00:17:17.829
Pepe hesitates a couple seconds too long.

00:17:17.829 --> 00:17:22.860
Alan’s aggression incites Pepe to sever
the doll's head.

00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:26.279
Does destroying the dolls head end the curse,
or doom them.

00:17:26.279 --> 00:17:27.600
It’s probably bad.

00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:30.769
Alan get’s the upper hand and shoves the
knife through Pepe’s heart.

00:17:30.769 --> 00:17:34.640
Pepe’s last words are that he won, which
means he loses.

00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:39.399
Pualina and Tyler get the message that in
this place, Gehenna, being the last one alive

00:17:39.399 --> 00:17:41.300
is a fate worse than death itself.

00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:44.610
That’s why the Japanese soldier killed himself
when they arrived.

00:17:44.610 --> 00:17:51.130
She grabs the Nambu and hands it to Tyler
to do the honors.

00:17:51.130 --> 00:18:05.990
It doesn’t take long for Alan to realize
he doomed himself as the eternal witness by

00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:09.650
forcing Pepe to destroy the doll and being
the last one alive.

00:18:09.650 --> 00:18:13.370
Better make yourself cozy in the barracks
until another group of dipshits wanders down

00:18:13.370 --> 00:18:16.690
here to take your spot after you commit suicide
for the final time.

00:18:16.690 --> 00:18:20.260
Ya know, you might be able to put the chief
doll back together and then tie it to the

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:21.970
bride doll to end the curse.

00:18:21.970 --> 00:18:23.710
Wouldn’t that be a twist.

00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:27.929
Everyone kills themselves to avoid eternal
torture, and then Alan just Elmers glues the

00:18:27.929 --> 00:18:30.860
doll back together to break the curse and
waltz out of the bunker.

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:35.450
The movie ends with Alan coming full circle
70 years later trying to warn his younger

00:18:35.450 --> 00:18:40.600
self.

00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:49.110
Let’s recap the pivotal points where different
decisions could have altered who lived and

00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:50.110
died.

00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:53.880
This gets into sketchy territory with the
whole time travel paradox thing.

00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:58.370
What we witnessed was the recurring time loop
after the group initially messed up by going

00:18:58.370 --> 00:18:59.600
down into the bunker.

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:02.559
The Japanese soldiers' time loop was mixed
in as well.

00:19:02.559 --> 00:19:05.910
It’s like a series of eternal time loops
happening simultaneously.

00:19:05.910 --> 00:19:12.130
Dave, Tyler, Paulina, and Pepe all died first,
as did the Japanese soldiers save for the

00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:13.130
commander.

00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:16.850
This move had the benefit that they weren’t
alive and stuck in the bunker for 70 years,

00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:18.539
but they weren’t free’d from it.

00:19:18.539 --> 00:19:21.960
They were still stuck in that loop, doomed
to repeat it over and over.

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:25.930
The only way this curse was stopped, is if
Paulina’s group had managed to bind the

00:19:25.930 --> 00:19:27.169
Bojobo dolls together.

00:19:27.169 --> 00:19:30.820
Otherwise, they and the Japanese soldiers
were doomed for eternity.

00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:34.970
Once the curse was broken, it’s not clear
if the dead will come back alive.

00:19:34.970 --> 00:19:35.970
Probably not.

00:19:35.970 --> 00:19:38.490
After Pepe severed the dolls head, it was
game over.

00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:40.909
This curse can likely never be broken.

00:19:40.909 --> 00:19:44.330
Any new visitors will be instantly doomed
with no way out.

00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:48.880
Even if a total excavation is performed, those
stuck in the time loop may not be freeable

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:50.309
since it’s out of this dimension.

00:19:50.309 --> 00:19:54.289
I’m not really sure we could have altered
the events drastically besides not entering

00:19:54.289 --> 00:19:55.440
the bunker.

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:59.289
Everyone was inevitably going to go a little
crazy, and none of them really trusted each

00:19:59.289 --> 00:20:00.990
other that much from the start.

00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:02.380
There was bound to be conflict.

00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:06.700
It all came down to Pepe decapitating the
doll, which was a dumbass move.

00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:11.390
I loosely get that he wanted vengeance on
Alan and what ‘his type of people’ did

00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:15.880
to the Chamorro, but he damned himself and
the others to eternal hell too, just more

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:17.650
intermittent than Alan’s version.

00:20:17.650 --> 00:20:22.500
It makes way more sense to break the curse
to save everyone, past, current, and future,

00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:23.850
then fight it out with Alan.

00:20:23.850 --> 00:20:28.470
If Alan kills you, you aren’t doomed in
a time loop, then Paulina and Tyler can take

00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:29.470
care of him.

00:20:29.470 --> 00:20:33.120
Their entire strategy of binding the dolls
together relied heavily on Dave’s history

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:37.669
lesson and him grabbing the bride doll at
the entrance before they went inside, Tyler’s

00:20:37.669 --> 00:20:40.880
Japanese fluency, and Paulina’s spanish
literacy.

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:43.010
All said and done, I’m not confident.

00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:45.870
I’d say the curse from Gehenna is unbeaten.

00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:50.130
Thanks for watching, and remember, don’t
explore remote uncharted territory with people

00:20:50.130 --> 00:20:52.530
you don’t trust.
