00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.180
Fear and Loathing is a movie about 2 protagonists:
Raoul Duke and Dr. Gonzo,

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:23.140
Duke is a journalist hired to do a story on the
Mint 400 Motorcycle Race in Vegas

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.780
and Dr. Gonzo is his attorney and fellow
connoisseur of drugs, drink, and debauchery

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:33.760
and both of them are here, hoping
to find the American dream in Vegas.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.059
As we follow their journey, they find the
Vegas Strip to be pleasantly disturbing but

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:43.190
lacking in good moral or ethical code:
people are here to pass the time, trying to find

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.540
a bright spot in a dark life, with fake 
smiles and fake happiness

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.630
They go from place to place, wreaking havoc
and chaos wherever they go until their trip

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:58.620
ends after a drug binge and other shenanigans,
with Gonzo and Duke leaving Vegas behind and

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.390
in turn the fear and loathing they felt there.

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:06.640
Now, this video isn't built for summarizing
film so much as it is for examining it, looking

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.430
at the things that contributed to the story

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:14.600
Because Fear and Loathing is based on a book
that is sort of-semi fictional written by

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:20.060
Hunter S. Thompson and based on his 
experiences that he had in Vegas so long ago

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.920
Now the real events surrounding Fear and Loathing goes
something like this: Thompson

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:32.400
is hired by Sports Illustrated to do a piece on the Mint
400 Motorcycle race in the Nevada Desert, near Vegas

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.640
However, while he’s there what he ends up
doing is writing the notes for Fear and Loathing

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.000
in Las Vegas, the book the film is based on.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.370
Now on his journey he was accompanied by Oscar
“Zeta” Cortez, a 300-pound-Chicano lawyer

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:49.640
who was a key civil rights attorney and is
portrayed by Benecio Del Toro

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.500
Now Cortez was a good friend of Thompson's and
was going to be interviewed by the journalist

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.850
to get details on the aftermath of Ruben Salazar’s
death, a Mexican-American journalist and civil

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.000
rights activist who would become a key figure
in an article by Thompson

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.460
called "Strange Rumblings in Aztlan”.

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:13.250
After visiting Vegas, Thompson would return
a month later to cover the District Attorney’s

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.360
Anti-Narcotics Convention which was in the
movie but is depicted as happening within

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.360
a weekend or so on the trip that Dr. Gonzo and Duke had

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.720
Now, there are a few other things that the
movie got right can be verified from secondary

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.850
sources like the Debbie Reynolds show that
Gonzo and Duke get kicked out of and the “Bazooko

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:37.410
Circus” casino which is actually the Circus
Circus Las Vegas Hotel-Casino in real life.

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.460
All of this is included and was directly or
loosely based upon actual passages from Thompson’s

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.849
book whose own ideas are reflected in Raoul
Duke.

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:52.100
You see, Raoul Duke is essentially Hunter
S. Thompson in all but name, as he also shares

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:58.100
Hunter’s views and stances: he's progressive,
counter-cultural, anti-authoritarianism, and filled

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:03.490
with patriotic passion for America and the
ideas that America is based on.

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:07.560
Fighting for justice in society when he felt
so compelled to do so although we don’t

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:08.970
really see this in the film.

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.880
something we do see throughout the film,
however, are references to figures and events

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:19.280
of the times: we see footage of what looks
like a bomber flying overhead a tropical jungle,

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.351
a reference to the Vietnam War, we
see Nixon’s appear on the TV, a reference

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:28.900
to then President Richard Nixon, and even
the Anti-Narcotics convention which did happen

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.100
in real life, and was instigated by Nixon’s
War on Drugs.

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:38.730
All of these are reminders of the failures of the Hippie
movement, but more than that it’s a peek

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:44.020
into the life and times of Hunter S. Thompson
in the wake of the 60s, of the Peace &amp; Love

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:47.930
Movements, the Hippies and the things they
fought for.

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:52.180
Even the music that we hear throughout the
film are period appropriate and were released

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:57.209
within the timeframe of the 60s and 70s. 
Some examples of these ‘older hippie songs’

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:01.920
are White Rabbit, One Toke Over the Line,
Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.500
and Jumpin’ Jack Flash..

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.739
and basically the American Dream that Duke wanted
from the Hippie movement never really existed

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:11.830
in the way he wanted it to be.

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:16.639
The equality, the peace, the free love, the
recreational drug use, and pursuit of self

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:20.769
actualization amongst many other things that
were fought for by the movement

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:23.669
Got off the ground but never flew.

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:28.639
The American Dream and the ideals that America
is built on is all about success, equality,

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:35.460
and the happiness of the people for the people
And closest thing to this being made real,

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:41.319
being achieved in Duke's lifetime, on the Vegas
Strip is with the Bazooko Circus casino owner.

00:04:41.319 --> 00:04:46.699
Who created his own circus allowing him to
make his own American Dream real.

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:50.620
Even if it's not the way Duke wanted it to
be.

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:55.629
The film ends on a bittersweet note by Duke
musing on the acid culture of the Hippies

00:04:55.629 --> 00:05:00.339
and how it screwed them over:
physically and spiritually.

00:05:00.339 --> 00:05:08.189
How Tim Leary, a prominent proponent of LSD-use
in the 60s brought about a generation of permanent

00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:15.400
cripples, failed seekers, who never understood
the essential old-mystic fallacy of the acid culture

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:20.830
The desperate assumption that somebody or
at least some force is tending to the light

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:22.449
at the end of the tunnel.

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:27.039
Duke and Thompson were and will always be 
in their own way and based on his writings,

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:32.500
we get a movie that reflects this attitude:
it’s very unique, it's strange, and mind-bending.

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:38.479
It’s sort of a dark comedy that uses techniques
that would feel at home in a horror movie.

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:42.340
Using weird angles, a wobbling lens, as well as disturbing imagery,

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:46.000
and audio manipulation and mechanized sets to 
disorientate the viewer,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.400
and put us in the golf shoes of Raoul Duke

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:54.920
and it’s not a film Hollywood would ever cherish,
and it only appeals to a niche audience.

00:05:54.920 --> 00:06:00.160
and if you like the sort of film that's dark, that's weird, and, well, unique.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.800
I'd highly suggest that you watch this film and if you've
already watched it once, well, watch it again

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.939
because this film is truly made made 
for freaks in the freak kingdom.

00:06:07.939 --> 00:06:10.339
With that being said, thank you so much
for watching, ladies and gentlemen.
