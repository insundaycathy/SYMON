00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:17.040
In 1995, Russian undercover agents, super-soldier&nbsp;
Alexei Shostakov and Black Widow Melina Vostokoff,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.000
pose as a normal family in Ohio&nbsp;
with their surrogate daughters&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.160
Natasha Romanoff and Yelena Belova. When the&nbsp;
mission to steal S.H.I.E.L.D. intel is complete,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:34.240
the family escapes to Cuba and rendezvous with&nbsp;
their boss, General Dreykov, who has Natasha&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:40.720
and Yelena taken to the Red Room for training.&nbsp;
Years pass, and Alexei is imprisoned in Russia,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:45.680
while Natasha defects to S.H.I.E.L.D. after&nbsp;
bombing Dreykov's Budapest office, apparently&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.520
killing him and his young daughter Antonia.
In 2016, Natasha is a fugitive for violating&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:59.440
the Sokovia Accords. She escapes from U.S.&nbsp;
Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross and flees&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:06.320
to a safehouse in Norway supplied by Rick Mason.&nbsp;
Meanwhile, Yelena kills a rogue former Black Widow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.600
but comes in contact with a synthetic gas that&nbsp;
neutralizes the Red Room's chemical mind-control&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:17.440
agent. Yelena sends the antidote to Natasha hoping&nbsp;
that she will return to help Yelena free the other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:23.360
Widows. When Natasha unknowingly drives off with&nbsp;
the antidote, she is attacked by Taskmaster,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.560
who is after it. Natasha manages to escape&nbsp;
Taskmaster and realizes that the antidote&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.880
came from Yelena. The two reunite in Budapest,&nbsp;
where Natasha learns Dreykov is alive and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:40.880
Red Room is still active. Shortly after, they are&nbsp;
attacked by Black Widows, and Natasha and Yelena&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.240
evade the Widows and Taskmaster before meeting&nbsp;
Mason, who supplies them with a helicopter.&nbsp;

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.760
Natasha and Yelena break Alexei out of prison to&nbsp;
learn Dreykov's location. He tells them to speak&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.880
with Melina, who lives on a farm outside Saint&nbsp;
Petersburg, where she developed the chemical mind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.640
control process used on the Widows. There, Yelena&nbsp;
reveals that while they were not a real family,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.560
she believed they were so. Melina admits she sent&nbsp;
their location to Dreykov, whose agents arrive and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:15.520
take them to the Red Room, an aerial facility.
Melina and Natasha use face mask technology&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.800
to switch places before being captured, allowing&nbsp;
Melina to free Alexei and Yelena from their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:26.640
restraints. Meanwhile, Natasha confronts Dreykov,&nbsp;
who sees through her disguise. Natasha learns&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:33.200
Taskmaster is Antonia, who suffered damage so&nbsp;
severe that Dreykov had to put a chip in her head,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.000
turning her into the perfect soldier, capable&nbsp;
of mimicking the actions of anyone she sees,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.280
including several Avengers. Natasha attempts&nbsp;
to kill Dreykov but fails to harm him due to a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.800
pheromone lock installed in every Widow. Dreykov&nbsp;
reveals that he controls Widows worldwide via his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.920
desk console. Natasha intentionally breaks&nbsp;
her nose, severing a nerve in her nasal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:59.840
passage to negate the pheromone, and then&nbsp;
attacks Dreykov. Alexei battles Taskmaster,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.560
while Melina takes out one of the facility's&nbsp;
engines, and Yelena searches for the other Widows,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:10.160
who are sent to protect Dreykov. Together,&nbsp;
Alexei and Yelena lock Taskmaster in a cell.&nbsp;

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:15.680
Dreykov escapes as the Widows attack Natasha, but&nbsp;
Yelena creates an antidote bomb that releases the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.480
Widows from the mind control. Natasha gets into&nbsp;
the control desk and copies the locations of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.920
other Widows worldwide as the facility begins&nbsp;
to explode and fall. Natasha retrieves the two&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.720
surviving vials of the antidote and frees&nbsp;
Taskmaster from the locked cell. Melina and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:37.040
Alexei escape via a plane just as Yelena takes out&nbsp;
Dreykov's helicopter, killing him. Natasha gives&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:43.120
Yelena a parachute before battling Taskmaster in&nbsp;
freefall. After landing, Natasha uses the antidote&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:48.960
on Taskmaster, freeing her from servitude.&nbsp;
The freed Widows arrive as Yelena, Melina, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:55.280
Alexei say goodbye to Natasha. She gives Yelena&nbsp;
the last antidote vial and the portable drive,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.360
telling her to find and free the other,&nbsp;
still mind-controlled, Widows. As they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:04.960
leave with Antonia, Natasha awaits Ross and&nbsp;
his men, who have arrived to apprehend her.&nbsp;

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:10.480
Two weeks later, Natasha reunites with Mason,&nbsp;
who supplies her with a Quinjet. She leaves,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.520
intending to free the imprisoned Avengers.
In a post-credits scene set after Natasha's death,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:23.520
Yelena encounters Contessa Valentina Allegra de&nbsp;
Fontaine at Natasha's grave. De Fontaine assigns&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:30.480
Clint Barton, whom she claims is responsible&nbsp;
for Natasha's death, as Yelena's next target.
