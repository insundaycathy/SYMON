00:00:06.592 --> 00:00:07.872
hey what's up guys

00:00:07.936 --> 00:00:11.776
today I'll show you a science fiction thriller film: "Vivarium"

00:00:12.096 --> 00:00:14.784
spoiler ahead, watch out and take care

00:00:15.296 --> 00:00:18.560
cuckoo is a kind of bird living a parasitic life

00:00:18.688 --> 00:00:22.848
about one-third of the female cuckoos will lay their eggs in other birds' nests

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.584
after the eggs hatch, the baby cuckoos will push other chicks out of the nest on purpose

00:00:27.712 --> 00:00:31.744
making the surrogate mother birds feed themselves as their own children

00:00:31.872 --> 00:00:33.920
by intruding into other birds' nests

00:00:33.984 --> 00:00:38.144
the baby cuckoos grow up disturbingly even larger than their surrogate mothers

00:00:38.464 --> 00:00:41.472
similar stories also happen in human society

00:00:41.792 --> 00:00:43.776
Gemma is a kindergarten teacher

00:00:44.032 --> 00:00:48.640
one day, she sees a girl in the kindergarten crying for two dead little birds

00:00:48.704 --> 00:00:52.800
obviously, those are two chicks pushed out of their nest by baby cuckoos

00:00:53.056 --> 00:00:56.064
Gemma comforts the girl that it's the law of nature

00:00:56.192 --> 00:00:59.904
her boyfriend Tom, is a gardener working in the same kindergarten as Gemma

00:01:00.096 --> 00:01:04.512
he helps bury the birds, trying to make his girlfriend happier in this way

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.712
the couple has a car, but both earn a low salary

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.144
the car is the only property they have

00:01:10.272 --> 00:01:12.256
under the pressure of Gemma's parents

00:01:12.384 --> 00:01:16.480
the young couple decides to buy a house, preparing for their future life

00:01:16.736 --> 00:01:21.664
one day after work, they drive to a real estate agent to ask about buying a house

00:01:21.856 --> 00:01:25.312
the real estate office is full of strange identical subjects

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.320
in which the agent greets them with a fixed smile

00:01:28.448 --> 00:01:31.776
though the couple shows no interest in the recommended properties

00:01:31.904 --> 00:01:35.168
the agent insists on taking them to see a sample house

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.800
following the agent, Gemma and Tom drive to a large housing estate called Yonder

00:01:40.992 --> 00:01:44.192
the couple are shocked by the seemingly endless identical green houses 

00:01:44.448 --> 00:01:46.048
when entering the community

00:01:46.304 --> 00:01:48.992
the uniform houses and lawns make them puzzled

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.424
the agent takes them to the number 9 house

00:01:51.744 --> 00:01:54.688
which is fully equipped and ready to welcome its new owner

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.440
there are even food and drinks in the fridge

00:01:57.824 --> 00:02:01.152
while showing them around, the agent asks if they have kids

00:02:01.408 --> 00:02:06.528
when Gemma replies to him "No. Not yet", he mimics her words strangely

00:02:06.784 --> 00:02:11.392
the agent seems quite satisfied with the house and highly recommends it to the couple

00:02:11.584 --> 00:02:16.256
he even says the couple can live here until the day they die and buried together

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.032
feeling offended, the couple leaves him alone to look around the house

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.784
however, they return to find the agent is gone

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.112
angry at the bad service, the couple decides to leave

00:02:26.432 --> 00:02:29.696
they try to drive out of the community but can't find the way back

00:02:30.016 --> 00:02:32.192
there are thousands of streets in the community 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.688
and each street looks exactly the same

00:02:35.008 --> 00:02:39.808
driving around and around, they're depressed to find themselves at house number 9 again

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.975
in the evening, they have lost mobile signal and run out of gasoline

00:02:43.975 --> 00:02:46.225
but they can't find anyone around

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.344
so they have to sleep in the number 9 house for the night

00:02:49.472 --> 00:02:52.672
they have some food left in the fridge but find it tasteless

00:02:52.864 --> 00:02:56.768
the next morning, the couple decides to escape from this strange place

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.624
they find a ladder from the house

00:02:58.944 --> 00:03:00.928
Tom climbs up the roof using the ladder

00:03:01.056 --> 00:03:03.232
hoping to get a general view of the neighborhood

00:03:03.488 --> 00:03:06.752
but he's desperate to see thousands and thousands of identical roofs

00:03:06.944 --> 00:03:09.056
stretching as far as his eye can reach

00:03:09.248 --> 00:03:13.920
frightened to be trapped here, Tom and Gemma run on foot toward the way the sun sets

00:03:14.112 --> 00:03:18.016
they keep climbing over the railings but still can't find the way out

00:03:18.208 --> 00:03:22.432
when night falls, Gemma suddenly notices there's a house  with the light on

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.120
it means that there must be people living in it

00:03:25.312 --> 00:03:27.552
the couple runs over to the house excitedly

00:03:27.616 --> 00:03:31.712
however, they're disappointed to find they have been back to the number 9 house again

00:03:31.904 --> 00:03:36.000
what's more puzzling is that there's a box full of packaged food in front of the house

00:03:36.192 --> 00:03:38.880
it seems someone has treated them as "prisoners"

00:03:39.264 --> 00:03:41.568
in order to force the man hiding behind to show up

00:03:41.696 --> 00:03:46.368
Tom sets fire to the house angrily and lets the smoke send a distress signal

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.352
they sleep on the road that night

00:03:48.672 --> 00:03:51.104
however, the next day when they wake up

00:03:51.232 --> 00:03:54.368
they're surprised to find the house remains in perfect condition

00:03:54.496 --> 00:03:57.952
and there's another box containing a newborn baby in front of the door

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.576
with a note "Raise the child and be released"

00:04:00.768 --> 00:04:05.184
the two are confused a lot by that, but to accept the fat baby as their own

00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:08.213
it seems it is the only way for them to do.

00:04:08.533 --> 00:04:13.589
98 days later however, the baby has grown to be like a primary school student

00:04:13.717 --> 00:04:18.197
who speaks like an adult and always mimics the couple's voices in a strange manner

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:20.693
the boy calls them mother and father

00:04:20.821 --> 00:04:23.189
however, they don't like the child at all

00:04:23.253 --> 00:04:26.773
as he always lets out creepy screams when he is unhappy

00:04:26.837 --> 00:04:28.373
Tom gradually gets mad

00:04:28.437 --> 00:04:32.149
as their life here is boring and they have to raise a freak boy

00:04:32.341 --> 00:04:33.685
during the time they live there

00:04:33.749 --> 00:04:36.949
Tom consistently leaves messages for help on the roof

00:04:37.077 --> 00:04:39.381
but no one ever finds his message

00:04:39.445 --> 00:04:42.389
there will be a box that appears in front of the house every morning

00:04:42.517 --> 00:04:44.501
bringing them their daily supplies

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:48.469
before the day ends, they put their life wastes in the box to be collected

00:04:48.661 --> 00:04:53.397
bored of his life, Tom does nothing every day but sits in the garden with Gemma

00:04:53.525 --> 00:04:56.213
waiting to find who sends and collects the boxes

00:04:56.341 --> 00:04:58.197
but they never see anyone

00:04:58.325 --> 00:05:01.269
the boxes just show and disappear in a second

00:05:01.397 --> 00:05:06.005
suddenly, a small area of the lawn burned by a cigarette attracts Tom's attention

00:05:06.261 --> 00:05:08.821
he finds the soil under the lawn unusual

00:05:08.885 --> 00:05:11.701
thinking that there must be something hiding underground

00:05:11.957 --> 00:05:13.941
so he starts to dig a hole in the garden

00:05:14.069 --> 00:05:16.437
hoping to escape from there through the tunnel

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:20.213
ever since he starts digging, Tom's life has been changed

00:05:20.405 --> 00:05:22.901
during the day, he always hurries to finish his meal

00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:25.845
then starts to dig the hole in the garden until night

00:05:26.037 --> 00:05:28.341
he communicates less and less with Gemma

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:31.413
sometimes he even sleeps at the bottom of the hole

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:33.397
it's another ordinary day

00:05:33.589 --> 00:05:35.701
Gemma sits on the ground of the living room

00:05:35.765 --> 00:05:38.517
watching the freak boy run over and play himself

00:05:38.773 --> 00:05:42.357
after a while, the boy turns on the TV and starts watching 

00:05:42.485 --> 00:05:45.301
the television shows bizarre and fractal-like patterns

00:05:45.429 --> 00:05:47.669
but the boy is totally absorbed in it

00:05:47.861 --> 00:05:49.205
when it comes to the night 

00:05:49.333 --> 00:05:52.853
Gemma and Tom spend their rare free time sitting in the car together

00:05:53.045 --> 00:05:56.565
luckily, there is still some power left to turn on the car radio

00:05:56.693 --> 00:05:58.613
being away from their world for long

00:05:58.741 --> 00:06:02.581
they're pleased to hear such beautiful music and can't help dancing to it

00:06:02.709 --> 00:06:06.357
however, life in the house has become an unbearable torment to Tom

00:06:06.485 --> 00:06:09.045
as the freak boy always bursts out screaming

00:06:09.173 --> 00:06:13.397
one morning after breakfast, the freak emits a high-pitched scream again

00:06:13.589 --> 00:06:17.173
Tom can't stand it anymore, so he locks the damned boy in the car

00:06:17.301 --> 00:06:19.221
leaving him alone to starve

00:06:19.349 --> 00:06:22.037
the boy shouts and struggles for help in the locked car

00:06:22.165 --> 00:06:24.213
arousing Gemma's maternal instincts

00:06:24.405 --> 00:06:26.133
in spite of Tom's opposition

00:06:26.261 --> 00:06:29.397
she takes the boy out of the car and brings him back to the room

00:06:29.525 --> 00:06:31.445
continuing to care for him

00:06:31.573 --> 00:06:33.575
upset about Gemma and his life

00:06:33.798 --> 00:06:37.446
Tom spends all day digging the hole and seldom talks to Gemma

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:39.942
the couple gradually alienates from each other

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:44.166
the only thing that makes Gemma's life better is to take care of the boy 

00:06:44.422 --> 00:06:46.214
she plays games with him every day

00:06:46.598 --> 00:06:49.222
sometimes they will have picnics together on the grass

00:06:49.286 --> 00:06:51.718
staring at the clouds in identical shapes

00:06:51.974 --> 00:06:54.534
one day however, the boy is missing

00:06:54.726 --> 00:06:58.246
Gemma looks for him anxiously but can't find him anywhere

00:06:58.374 --> 00:07:00.230
at night, the boy comes back alone 

00:07:00.358 --> 00:07:03.686
with a book full of strange patterns and terrifying words

00:07:03.814 --> 00:07:05.862
Gemma asks him who gave him the book

00:07:05.926 --> 00:07:09.766
the boy suddenly makes strange sounds and inflates his throat sacs

00:07:09.894 --> 00:07:11.878
acting like a toad monster

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:15.718
Gemma cries out in despair, for she can't stand it either 

00:07:16.166 --> 00:07:18.790
soon another 98 days pass by

00:07:18.982 --> 00:07:21.414
the boy has grown to resemble a young man

00:07:21.606 --> 00:07:23.590
Gemma has become afraid of the freak

00:07:23.782 --> 00:07:27.238
she weeps out her regret to Tom that they should have killed the boy

00:07:27.366 --> 00:07:31.142
at this time, Tom has become too weak to speak aloud and wash himself

00:07:31.334 --> 00:07:33.275
his back is covered with bruises

00:07:33.415 --> 00:07:35.911
Gemma has to figure out a way on her own

00:07:36.103 --> 00:07:39.175
she follows the freak when he leaves the house during the day

00:07:39.303 --> 00:07:41.351
but she gets lost before long

00:07:41.479 --> 00:07:43.207
while Tom is working on the tunnel

00:07:43.335 --> 00:07:46.023
he finds a corpse in a body bag from underground

00:07:46.151 --> 00:07:49.287
with his shit scared out, Tom climbs out of the hole 

00:07:49.415 --> 00:07:51.783
and happens to hear Gemma's call for help

00:07:51.911 --> 00:07:54.791
he guides Gemma to find the way back with his sound

00:07:54.983 --> 00:07:56.647
the couple finally finds each other

00:07:56.775 --> 00:07:59.271
but they're locked outside of the house by the freak

00:07:59.463 --> 00:08:01.319
so they have to sleep in the car

00:08:01.575 --> 00:08:05.799
after days without food, Tom becomes sicker and is close to death

00:08:05.991 --> 00:08:07.911
when the freak comes out during the day

00:08:07.975 --> 00:08:10.023
Gemma pleads with him to save her lover

00:08:10.151 --> 00:08:13.415
but he replies indifferently that it's time for Tom to be released

00:08:13.607 --> 00:08:16.743
the poor Tom dies in Gemma's arms, eventually

00:08:16.871 --> 00:08:20.647
the freak brings back a box, in which there's another vacuum bag 

00:08:20.775 --> 00:08:23.079
he zips Tom's dead body into it

00:08:23.207 --> 00:08:28.711
Gemma can do nothing but watch the freak throw Tom's body into that hole dug by Tom

00:08:28.903 --> 00:08:32.679
she loses her mind in anger and ambushes the freak with a pickaxe

00:08:32.871 --> 00:08:35.367
however, she can only hurt him a little

00:08:35.559 --> 00:08:38.247
the freak injures and makes strange noises 

00:08:38.375 --> 00:08:43.687
he opens the street as if throwing back a sheet and crawls into a maze underground

00:08:43.879 --> 00:08:45.671
Gemma follows him into the maze 

00:08:45.927 --> 00:08:48.103
she is surprised by this underground world

00:08:48.231 --> 00:08:50.407
it's like a colorful haunted house

00:08:50.471 --> 00:08:54.311
where she sees others repeat a similar miserable life in a similar house 

00:08:54.439 --> 00:08:56.487
with a similar freak boy

00:08:56.679 --> 00:09:00.071
Gemma sees all of the familiar scenes as a fast-forward movie

00:09:00.199 --> 00:09:02.887
ending with the death of those poor people like her

00:09:03.015 --> 00:09:05.511
Gemma is so depressed to fall downstairs

00:09:05.575 --> 00:09:08.583
and finds herself back in the number 9 house again

00:09:08.839 --> 00:09:13.275
Gemma finally realizes that they have been imprisoned since they enter this community

00:09:13.275 --> 00:09:15.650
she has never felt so weak and hopeless

00:09:15.879 --> 00:09:18.439
in desperation, she closes her eyes

00:09:18.823 --> 00:09:22.791
the last thing she knows is that the freak puts her body into a new vacuum bag

00:09:22.855 --> 00:09:26.375
and says indifferently that mothers should die after raising their children

00:09:26.631 --> 00:09:30.343
Gemma says with her last reserves of strength that she wants to go home

00:09:30.471 --> 00:09:34.695
the freak however, replies thrillingly that this is her home and resting place

00:09:35.079 --> 00:09:39.239
after Gemma dies, the freak buries her with Tom and fills the hole

00:09:39.367 --> 00:09:43.399
the hole then disappears in a moment as if nothing has ever happened

00:09:43.911 --> 00:09:48.839
after the couple dies, the freak repaints the number 9 house to its original condition

00:09:49.095 --> 00:09:50.759
he fills the couple's car with gas

00:09:50.887 --> 00:09:54.215
then drives out of the community easily to the real estate office

00:09:54.407 --> 00:09:56.263
where Tom and Gemma once went

00:09:56.519 --> 00:09:59.783
the agent who met the couple lies in the chair, waiting for him

00:10:00.103 --> 00:10:03.431
however, he seems very old and is about to die

00:10:03.687 --> 00:10:07.399
the freak gets the agent's name tag to take over his responsibilities

00:10:07.527 --> 00:10:13.223
he then moves the dying agent's body into a bag, folds it up, and puts it into a drawer

00:10:13.479 --> 00:10:16.743
finishing all this, the freak sits down behind the table 

00:10:16.871 --> 00:10:20.327
now he has become the new agent waiting for his clients

00:10:20.519 --> 00:10:22.695
at this moment, the doorbell rings

00:10:22.823 --> 00:10:27.047
as another couple walks into the office, the new agent stands to welcome them
