00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.640
You have just been tricked into entering&nbsp;
the ultimate gambling tournament only to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.160
find out that this is a death game and&nbsp;
you'll need to outsmart your opponents,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.440
nab anyone in the back and risk everything just&nbsp;
to stay alive. What do you do when you're gambling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.680
with your life and a single mistake will turn you&nbsp;
into a wage slave. I'm going to break down the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.960
mistakes made, what you should do and how to beat&nbsp;
every death game in Kaiji: The Ultimate Gambler.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.040
This kid has no luck. Kaiji here just spent the&nbsp;
last of his money on a losing lottery ticket,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:36.160
but it's only the beginning of a no good, very bad&nbsp;
day. He walks past several Mercedes in the parking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.640
lot and starts kicking them out of jealousy. Two&nbsp;
other guys get out of the car, and he realises&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.360
he's made the biggest mistake of his life. Chasing&nbsp;
him through the street, he's caught and held down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.440
until this loan shark arrives. They take him to&nbsp;
an office where the loan shark tells him that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.240
his friend borrowed her money and disappeared and&nbsp;
since Kaiji here signed a guaranteed payment on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.240 --> 00:01:00.160
a loan for 300,000 yen, he's now responsible for&nbsp;
paying back over 2 million in interest. He doesn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.800
have the money and starts to break down crying.&nbsp;
Alright, if this guy still has his death note then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.200
now would be a really great time to use it because&nbsp;
his day is getting worse by the minute, but he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.120
actually had a way out of this and overlooked&nbsp;
something really important. In Japan, it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:18.800
illegal to charge more than 20% interest annually,&nbsp;
and if he owes 2 million, that's a rate of 160%.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.240
If I were him, I would have taken the documents as&nbsp;
evidence to report the extortion and pay the 20%.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.000
It's still a lot of money, but it's&nbsp;
better than gambling your life away.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.320
The loan shark tells the kid, there's a gambling&nbsp;
ship that's leaving in four hours and if he wins&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.960
the game, that he can start a new life and she'll&nbsp;
erase his debt. He takes the deal and goes to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.440
the harbor where this massive ship is docked.&nbsp;
He has one last chance to make things right,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.240
but he has no idea he'll be gambling with&nbsp;
his life. Kaiji here is taken to a room full&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.880
of other competitors who are just as desperate as&nbsp;
he is and willing to do whatever it takes to win.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.520
An announcement is made welcoming the players&nbsp;
as this man, Tonegawa, tells them that in order&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.680
for them to play they'll be loaned three of&nbsp;
these stars which are worth 1 million yen each,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:05.600
however, the interest rate is a brutal&nbsp;
1% per minute. Okay, this is sketchy,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.320
nobody takes you off the street and puts 3 million&nbsp;
yen in your hands, unless you are the actual&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.320
commodity here and not the player, where you are&nbsp;
being bought and sold for something larger here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.160
and we need to keep that in mind if we want to&nbsp;
survive, because with this much money on the line,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.800
you have next to no control over what happens to&nbsp;
you, and that makes for a very dangerous game.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.760
Theyâ€™re all given three stars and a hand of 12&nbsp;
cards and will be playing rock paper scissors.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.680
They have to pair up and play a card,&nbsp;
laying it down on the table. For each win,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.440
they gain a star from the loser, and whoever&nbsp;
still has three or more stars after all 12&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.000
cards are played will win and go back home&nbsp;
debt-free, but they only have 30 minutes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.760
As the host leaves the game begins&nbsp;
and the players start going nuts.

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.960
Okay, while everyone is scrambling, we should&nbsp;
take a moment to observe our competitors. First,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.040
we need to pick out the most insecure and&nbsp;
predictable person in the room. This guy here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.120
seems pretty desperate, so I would choose him&nbsp;
to play. Now, it would be normal to assume that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.440
this is a game of chance, but it's not. Patterns&nbsp;
of this game have actually been studied and they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.760
found that when a player wins one round they're&nbsp;
more likely to play the same thing again. This is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.880
called a win-stay lose-shift strategy, and I would&nbsp;
use it to beat them. If you lose the first round,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.560
the best thing to do is switch to the card that&nbsp;
beats what your opponent just played, this will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.800
take advantage of your opponents most probable&nbsp;
game strategy and you're more likely to win.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.400
There's also another element of human&nbsp;
psychology here that we can exploit.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.640
It's a very natural instinct to wanna keep your&nbsp;
options open, so I would expect that the last&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.360
three cards in anyone's hands are going to be&nbsp;
all three options of rock paper and scissors. As&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.280
soon as they play one, I know what the other two&nbsp;
cards are and have better odds of beating them.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.360
Everyone is gambling their stars away without&nbsp;
any strategy when Kaiji hears someone screaming.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.520
This guy begs to be let go and they all watch&nbsp;
as this player gets dragged away by one of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:49.200
guards and taken into a dark room. It's only been&nbsp;
three minutes and he's already lost all his stars.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.000
The door slams shut, and all they can hear are&nbsp;
his screams. That's when this man Funai grabs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.080
Kaiji here and tells him he has a strategy to&nbsp;
beat this game. If they work together and only&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:02.160
play the same cards at the same time, it will&nbsp;
be a draw. This lets them use all their cards&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.720
and keep their stars. So they shake on it and&nbsp;
start playing. Alright, if we're here to win,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.880
he's just given you the best chance you'll get all&nbsp;
night. I would play a winning card in the first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:15.680
play, take his star and walk away. I'm not here&nbsp;
to make friends, I'm here to make money. The man&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.480
instructs Kaiji here to play rock scissors paper&nbsp;
in that order, and the first turn is a draw. They&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:25.200
keep this pattern going and the plan is working&nbsp;
until Funai here suddenly plays a winning card.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.680
He apologises for the mistake and tells him to&nbsp;
use rock next so that he can get his star back,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.520
but on the next turn, the guy play&nbsp;
scissors, and Funai here wins again.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.440
He takes Kaiji's star and the kid is&nbsp;
not happy. He shoves him to the floor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.680
and punches him as both men notice that&nbsp;
some blood has landed on Kaiji's last card.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.680
He gets restrained by the staff and he tells&nbsp;
them what happened, but they don't care,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.960
no rules were broken, and he's only&nbsp;
got himself to blame for being tricked.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:55.120
Okay, this was a great con. Now, Kaiji's only got&nbsp;
one star and one card left, but there's a silver&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:59.440
lining here because the staff were totally fine&nbsp;
with them abusing the rules and playing all draws.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.760
I would start to reconsider every rule we were&nbsp;
told and what wasn't said. So I would look for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.840
two types of people to take advantage of, the&nbsp;
first are those who have three stars and want&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.920
to get rid of their cards but are too scared to&nbsp;
play and lose. This guy here gets caught trying to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:16.080
flush them down the toilet, which is against the&nbsp;
rules, but giving them to another player isn't.

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.760
And he would definitely give us his cards if we&nbsp;
offered to take them. Then the second type of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:24.000
victim is someone with two stars but has no cards&nbsp;
left because they'll be desperate to win a third&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000
star. Now, if we just got a bunch of spare cards&nbsp;
from this guy then we can sell them to that guy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
for one star and he would buy them because it's&nbsp;
his only way to win. As long as we're discrete&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
with our trades and find the right victims, we&nbsp;
could repeat this several times back and forth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.280
and get rich without playing a single game. With&nbsp;
15 minutes left, Funai here reveals to everyone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:45.600
that Kaiji's last card is scissors, anyone&nbsp;
who has rock can beat him, but then the kid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:50.400
reveals that Funai's last card is rock and they&nbsp;
should all beat him instead. The other players&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:54.800
are skeptical, so Funai here suggests everyone&nbsp;
re-shuffle. They all agree and rush in to join,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.480
but Kaiji here notices this helpless man&nbsp;
on the ground and comes up with a plan.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:03.360
Funai re-deals everyone new playing cards, but&nbsp;
Kaiji sees a man save one card for himself.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:07.680
After the shuffle, the man approaches and asks&nbsp;
to play a second time, offering two of his stars,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:12.320
but Kaiji here raises it to three stars, betting&nbsp;
both his and this guy's stars combined. So the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:16.320
man agrees to play. With three minutes&nbsp;
remaining Funai puts down his last card,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:21.280
teasing Kaiji for being tricked again, but this&nbsp;
time Kaiji has the last laugh when he plays paper.

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:24.400
He won and takes three of his stars,&nbsp;
giving one of them to his partner.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:29.440
Okay, this was a brilliant gamble, but it only&nbsp;
worked because Kaiji was being highly observant&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:34.240
here. He knew Funai saw the blood on his card and&nbsp;
organised a shuffle just to clear his suspicion,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:38.160
so that he could play Kaiji using the same&nbsp;
winning card, but Kaiji secretly wiped the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:42.400
blood off and traded it for this guy's paper&nbsp;
card, putting blood on it to trick Funai.

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:47.120
With only 30 seconds left, Kaiji and the old man&nbsp;
split up the remaining cards and play each other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:51.680
in one final game. They draw each time getting&nbsp;
to keep their stars and use all their cards&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:56.320
just as time runs out, but the old man forgets he&nbsp;
had one last card in his pocket and he's not going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:00.880
to be able to pass. The kid decides to do the&nbsp;
honorable thing and takes mutual responsibility&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:04.720
for the loss. He's brought into the back room&nbsp;
where they inject the microchip into his arm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:10.080
and brand him. Alright, the obvious thing to&nbsp;
do here is throw this guy under the bus, it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:14.400
just not right to make two players lose from a&nbsp;
single card, but if we insisted on being a loser,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:18.320
then at the very least, we should claim that&nbsp;
the card belongs to us and to let this guy go,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:22.560
otherwise, it's an incredible waste of opportunity&nbsp;
here, and they're both gonna pay for this mistake&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:27.280
very soon. Kaiji along with all the other&nbsp;
losers are moved underground and forced to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:31.920
work as slaves in a labor camp for 15 years&nbsp;
to pay off their debts, there's no way out,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:36.160
and they're being monitored 24/7. They go back&nbsp;
to their dormitory where Kaiji here receives&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:39.680
his first paycheck. This underground&nbsp;
labor camp uses a different currency,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:43.840
and is only worth a tenth of a yen, he'll never&nbsp;
be able to save up enough money to get out.

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:49.840
Okay, the first problem I see is too much&nbsp;
individuality. So far they only seem to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:54.000
controlled by the foreman here and a few staff&nbsp;
members, there must be more security down here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.240
but they're still outnumbered by the labor force.&nbsp;
If things are this hopeless and they have no&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:02.720
chance of saving up enough money to earn their way&nbsp;
out, then I would start planning for an uprising.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:07.120
We need to make friends with the other work crews&nbsp;
and figure out who the leaders are. If we convince&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:11.280
them to join the rebellion, they can use their&nbsp;
influence over their crews and start gathering&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:16.000
equipment, scouting locations for possible escape&nbsp;
routes and figure out the guards' routines.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.960
We also need to know which way the&nbsp;
construction vehicles come from and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:23.280
the layout of the underground tunnels, there&nbsp;
must be an elevator or ramp system big enough&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:27.680
to bring these vehicles down here directly. We&nbsp;
should coordinate a day where we all rebel then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:32.480
hijack the construction vehicles and drive them&nbsp;
out of here to the surface. As in any revolution,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:36.480
many of us will die, but I'd rather die&nbsp;
on my feet, than keep living on my knees.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:40.720
He gets back to work when an explosion goes&nbsp;
off and shakes the entire underground network,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:44.400
he takes his injured friend to the medic, but&nbsp;
when he sees other workers here left untreated,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:49.200
he realises these patients don't have enough&nbsp;
money to buy medicine. The air is so bad down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:52.800
here that they're all getting sick, but the&nbsp;
boss is tempting workers into spending their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:57.360
money so that they never get healthy or pay off&nbsp;
their debt. They need to escape this place for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:01.440
any hope to survive, but they're in luck as&nbsp;
the doctor points to a message in the corner,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:05.520
written in blood and tells them there's only&nbsp;
one way out, and it's called brave men road.

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:10.080
Okay, brave men road sounds too brave for&nbsp;
me, but there's something here that Kaiji&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:14.240
is not considering yet, this medical area has&nbsp;
something way more valuable than everywhere else,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:17.520
and that's medicine. It's pretty clear&nbsp;
that honest labor will get us nowhere,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:21.920
so I would plan on stealing all the medication&nbsp;
I could. First, observe which drugs are being&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:25.040
sold to which conditions and figure out&nbsp;
which of these drugs are the strongest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:29.120
and most profitable, then come back and&nbsp;
admit yourself by faking that condition.

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:33.200
The medication will be brought out of storage&nbsp;
to be sold, and we can steal enough of it with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:36.960
a distraction to then sell to our co-workers&nbsp;
and undercut the rates. They would all want&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:40.560
to buy it for the cheaper price, so they'll&nbsp;
keep it a secret for us as well, and we can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:45.440
make money a lot more quickly than before. Later&nbsp;
that day, Kaiji here considers what he's learned,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:49.360
and when the foreman comes by to extort him&nbsp;
for an advance on his salary, he flips out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:53.440
Making a scene, he calls the foreman a crook&nbsp;
for manipulating them, but Kaiji is interrupted&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:57.360
when some guards announce that this man has&nbsp;
been chosen to compete on the brave men road,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:01.600
and they learn that whoever wins will go back&nbsp;
to the surface. Hearing this, Kaiji decides to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:06.000
volunteer and take back his freedom even if&nbsp;
it kills him. Joining several other workers,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.160
they're taken up an elevator to the 50th floor&nbsp;
of a skyscraper where they're told the rules of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:14.560
this new game. All they have to do is deliver&nbsp;
these cash vouchers to a designated location&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:19.040
at the Starside hotel and exchange them for cash,&nbsp;
but to get there, they must cross this crane that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:22.880
leads to the building next to them and make it&nbsp;
to the other side. They'll get 10 million cash&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:27.120
if they do, but the men are too scared to cross&nbsp;
it until Kaiji here volunteers. The others are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:31.840
inspired to join him until the host reveals that&nbsp;
their bridge to freedom is electrified as well.

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:35.680
Inside the building, a table of rich guests&nbsp;
are watching the event for entertainment,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:38.560
so the workers aren't allowed to use&nbsp;
their hands when they cross the beam.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:43.360
Okay, this one would defeat me because I'm super&nbsp;
scared of heights, but if we can move past the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:47.360
fear factor here, then there might actually be a&nbsp;
way to do this without falling. Now we can't touch&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:50.800
the beams with our hands, but we also learned in&nbsp;
the first game, that they're totally fine with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:55.440
you bending the rules to your advantage as long as&nbsp;
you accomplish the task and entertain the guests.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:59.120
What we need here is more stability, and if we&nbsp;
can add more points of contact with the bridge,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:02.640
then we'll have a better chance at this. This&nbsp;
building is pretty high up, and if you've ever&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:06.960
been to the top of a skyscraper, it can get pretty&nbsp;
windy. If the wind is catching on your clothes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:10.480
it adds drag and can throw you off&nbsp;
balance. So if we minimise our frame,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:15.040
then there will be less resistance. Now tightrope&nbsp;
walkers use giant poles to lower their center of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:19.920
gravity and spread out their mass to decrease the&nbsp;
rotational inertia, unfortunately, all these guys&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:24.160
have are the clothes on their backs, so that's&nbsp;
what we need to use to achieve the same goal.

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:28.160
I would tie all my clothing together in a long&nbsp;
rope and swing it under the bridge, then catch it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:32.400
on the other side, now we have added two points of&nbsp;
contact with the bridge and lowered our center of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:36.800
gravity, like a tightrope walker so this will let&nbsp;
us shuffle ourselves forwards with more stability.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:40.560
If we lean too forward in any direction, we can&nbsp;
simply pull in the cloth rope and correct our&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:44.960
balance. The rich viewers might not like this, but&nbsp;
it's definitely worth trying if it means we won't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:50.080
fall to our deaths. Kaiji here has a big idea,&nbsp;
he pulls this marker out of thin air and draws&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:53.840
a line on everyone's shoes to help them align&nbsp;
themselves to the bridge and keep their balance,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:58.080
they all feel more confident to make it across now&nbsp;
and start walking out onto the bridge one by one.

00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:03.280
Okay, Kaiji here is doing some great thinking,&nbsp;
unfortunately, it's the wrong strategy,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:07.600
drawing a line down the middle of your shoe seems&nbsp;
like a good idea, but the problem is if your foot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:11.840
is perfectly centered, then you have to balance&nbsp;
yourself with the most narrow part of your foot,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:16.320
this makes it extremely difficult to adjust&nbsp;
your balance if you start leaning left or right.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:20.560
The better strategy here is to angle your foot&nbsp;
sideways so that if you begin to sway, you have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:25.040
more width across the walkway, and can use more of&nbsp;
the muscles in your feet to maintain your balance.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:29.120
We can take a lesson from skateboarders here, they&nbsp;
don't face forward or line their feet straight,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:33.920
they angle themselves, and it gives them extremely&nbsp;
good balance, so we should use the same strategy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:38.240
Kaiji here almost falls and manages to catch&nbsp;
himself, but that's when they see storm clouds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:42.880
flash in the distance. Player one starts to&nbsp;
lose his balance out of desperation, he jumps&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:47.680
forward onto the electrified bridge and falls&nbsp;
to his death, that's one down and nine to go.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:52.400
Player six here tries to hold on to the bridge&nbsp;
and shocks himself causing him to fall off. Player&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:56.960
five chickens out and turns back, grabbing the man&nbsp;
behind him, and they both plummet to their deaths.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:00.320
Eventually, there's only three players&nbsp;
left in the game, as it starts to rain.

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:03.920
They all continue to make their way across&nbsp;
the bridge, but the old man tells Kaiji here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:08.480
he can't continue. He asks him to take his money&nbsp;
voucher and exchange it for his daughter before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:14.560
falling off the bridge. Okay, if I'm being honest,&nbsp;
this old man, never had a chance. He's too old and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:19.040
unstable to survive this walk and helping him,&nbsp;
will only put us at risk. If he wants to save&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:23.520
his daughter, he needs to walk towards me to hand&nbsp;
it over because I'm not changing my direction and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:29.440
walking backwards on a slippery metal pole in the&nbsp;
rain 200 meters above the ground, it's also highly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:33.840
unlikely that this slave driving corporation,&nbsp;
will let me redeem both coupons for a combined&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:38.800
20 million yen. So the best move here is to let&nbsp;
this guy Ishida die and keep walking forwards&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:43.840
to focus on surviving. The remaining players&nbsp;
continue crossing and make it to the other side,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:47.520
they're just about to win, but Kaiji senses&nbsp;
that something is not right about this.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:51.840
He warns the other player, but it's too late, the&nbsp;
door suddenly flies open and they're blown away&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:56.400
by a wind blast. There was one last trick&nbsp;
the organisers of the death game set up.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:56.400 --> 00:14:01.040
While Kaiji here is left hanging, his friend&nbsp;
falls to his death. Climbing back up the ledge,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:05.280
he crawls into the building and finds the members&nbsp;
of the corporation applauding his performance.

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:09.520
The chairman of the company walks in and&nbsp;
Kaiji here chews them out for their cruelty.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:13.920
He demands they pay him his 20 million, but&nbsp;
the host refuses, deducting nearly all the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:18.640
money from Kaiji's voucher to pay off his debt.&nbsp;
He yells at the host that the old man who fell&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:23.120
proved he wasn't a loser because in his last&nbsp;
dying moments he was thinking of someone else.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:27.600
The chairman here finds the kid interesting&nbsp;
and decides to set up one last game for him.

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:31.120
Okay, these guys are obviously horrible&nbsp;
people and most of them should be shot,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:35.360
but it's hard to stay mad when we're definitely&nbsp;
better off right now than we were days ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:39.920
This poor guy keeps ending up in apocalyptic&nbsp;
scenarios, and at this point, maybe the best&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:44.160
thing for him to do is move out of the country.&nbsp;
There aren't any battle royales in Brazil,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:49.120
which hold the largest Japanese community outside&nbsp;
of Japan. The government promoted immigration as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:54.720
a national policy until the late 1960s to get rid&nbsp;
of poverty and over-population and Kaiji here fits&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:58.880
the bill. As soon as he walks free, he's going&nbsp;
to remember how miserable his life was and will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:02.480
fall into the same bad decisions, and he'll&nbsp;
probably blow all his money on scratch cards,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:07.280
so there's no point going back without a boatload&nbsp;
of cash. Kaiji sits down and they tell him he will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:12.960
be playing e-card against the host, Tonegawa.&nbsp;
There are two sets of five cards, one plays as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:18.320
the emperor and the other plays as the slave.&nbsp;
The game is simple, they'll play three rounds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:23.280
and each player picks a card and puts it down on&nbsp;
the table, two citizens will result in a draw,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:28.480
which means the round continues, while a citizen&nbsp;
beats a slave and the emperor beats the citizen,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:32.800
but because a slave has nothing to lose it's&nbsp;
the only card that can beat the emperor.

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:36.800
The host explains that he cannot choose his&nbsp;
cards randomly and must look at the card and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:40.160
make a decision before putting it on the&nbsp;
table. He's offered the choice to play&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:44.880
as the emperor or as a slave, which pays 10&nbsp;
to 1. He decides to take the slave and he's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:49.280
put himself at a disadvantage. The slave&nbsp;
player must go first and Kaiji's opponent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:52.880
will get to see his facial expressions,&nbsp;
so the odds of winning are extremely low.

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:58.880
Okay, this is daunting. Tonegawa here runs this&nbsp;
entire underground gambling empire and has watched&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:03.680
and studied people's gambling habits in life and&nbsp;
death situations for a long time, he has a huge&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:08.320
advantage, and we need to find a way to remove&nbsp;
that if this is going to be a fair game. Now,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:12.320
before we started, he made a point to mention that&nbsp;
we aren't allowed to be random in our strategy,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:17.600
and he also said, that we must look at the card&nbsp;
before we put it down, this is a big deal because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:22.240
it tells us everything about his own strategy. He&nbsp;
needs to read our expressions and body language to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:26.400
make his decision. Now when the stakes are&nbsp;
this high, trying to control or fake your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:31.040
micro-expressions is a lot more difficult than you&nbsp;
might think. When we are under extreme stress, our&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:35.920
emotions tend to leak out so I would simply pull&nbsp;
my shirt over my head to cover my face so that I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:40.080
could still see the cards, but he couldn't see my&nbsp;
expressions at all because it's going to take away&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:44.560
his advantage and help me win, and if the chairman&nbsp;
here thinks it's entertaining he might approve of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:50.080
the tactic. They start the game and Kaiji plays&nbsp;
his first card, but without hesitation, the host&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:55.360
plays his own and they draw. He plays his next&nbsp;
card without even looking, the host plays his,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:59.920
something strange is going on, as the host doesn't&nbsp;
even look up to analyse the kid's expressions.

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:03.440
On the third turn, Kaiji here goes&nbsp;
for the win and puts on a slave card,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:08.240
hoping the host will play the emperor, but the&nbsp;
host can read his mind. He turns over a citizen,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:12.960
taking away any chances of Kaiji winning. The&nbsp;
chairman wants to see more, and gives a loan to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:16.960
Kaiji here so that he can continue playing,&nbsp;
but he's warned that this time if he loses,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:21.920
he'll have to work underground for the rest of&nbsp;
his life. Okay, before playing another round,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:26.080
we have to remember who our opponents are, these&nbsp;
guys have bent the rules either for their own&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:30.800
entertainment or to screw over the players. It's&nbsp;
fair to assume that this game is stacked against&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:35.200
you. So at this point, I will be looking for any&nbsp;
signs of cheating, I would inspect the table and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:39.440
the room for any cameras or sensors as well&nbsp;
as any noticeable markings on the cards. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:43.760
might even have an ear piece, so I would ask&nbsp;
anyone standing behind me to clear the area&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:48.000
so they can't tell him what my cards are, but&nbsp;
even if I didn't find anything, Tonegawa here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.680
has already dropped hints that should make&nbsp;
us suspicious, by telling us he can read our&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:56.560
minds. If this is somehow true, he wouldn't&nbsp;
be letting us know this. The man definitely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:56.560 --> 00:18:00.800
knows how to keep every advantage a secret,&nbsp;
so his opponent doesn't adjust his strategy,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:05.680
and Kaiji here is about to figure out that this&nbsp;
wasn't a careless comment, but a calculated one.

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:10.000
This second time around, Kaiji decides to go&nbsp;
against expectations and play the slave on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.720
first turn, but as he's about to place it, he&nbsp;
notices his opponent isn't even looking at his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:20.000
own cards, the man is looking at something else&nbsp;
entirely. When the host finally plays his hand,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.800
it's a citizen card, and in one turn, he's&nbsp;
ended Kaiji's life. The kid gets dragged out,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:29.200
but as he reaches the elevator, he remembers the&nbsp;
man wasn't wearing the same watch as before and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:34.000
realises it must have been what he was looking&nbsp;
at. He was using the implanted chip in Kaiji's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:39.360
shoulder to monitor his physiological responses to&nbsp;
the game, the whole thing was a setup. He's been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:44.000
tricked into betting his life away, but as he lays&nbsp;
on the floor, he begins to form a plan. Asking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:48.000
to go to the bathroom, he meets the loan shark&nbsp;
and tells her, he's figured out how to win this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:52.560
time and convinces her to give him another loan.&nbsp;
Walking back into the room, Kaiji asks for one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:57.280
final round, and he's got the money to back it up.&nbsp;
Tonegawa resists but the chairman is interested&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:57.280 --> 00:19:02.320
and orders him to play. Okay, we still don't have&nbsp;
the upper hand here, but we can even the playing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:06.560
field. This guy can track my physiological&nbsp;
responses to each card I play, and there are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:11.280
four meters on this watch measuring heart rate,&nbsp;
blood pressure, body temperature and perspiration.

00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:15.520
When people are put in stressful situations,&nbsp;
their body produces adrenaline, triggering&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:19.200
their flight or fight response. This makes&nbsp;
their heart beat faster and increases their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:23.200
blood pressure. If we want a chance at beating&nbsp;
this man, we have to manipulate his meters by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:27.520
keeping our heart rate high, so he can't see any&nbsp;
fluctuation based on my decision-making. If I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:32.400
start taking short rapid breaths, my pulse will&nbsp;
get faster creating a simulated panic response,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:37.840
this will throw Tonegawa off his game, giving me&nbsp;
a better chance to win. Before they begin, Kaiji&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:41.920
slams his head into the mirror and they think&nbsp;
he's gone crazy, but it's all a part of his plan.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:46.160
He takes three of the citizen cards and hides them&nbsp;
on his chair before flipping the remaining two&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:51.280
left on the table. With Tonegawa distracted by&nbsp;
the chairman, Kaiji switches a citizen card for a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:56.640
slave, just as the man turns back around. The host&nbsp;
checks his watch and sees his sensors going wild.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:56.640 --> 00:20:01.120
Fired up, the kid slams his hand on the table,&nbsp;
spilling blood all over his cards. The loan&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:05.840
shark tells him to calm down, so he wipes his&nbsp;
cards, and prepares to play the game of his life.

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:10.320
Okay, he shouldn't be calming down, he's cut&nbsp;
himself pretty well, but his vitals might go&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:14.800
right back to normal after a few minutes. I would&nbsp;
want a guarantee we had a level playing field for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:19.040
the entire game, so I would go once step further&nbsp;
and take one of these glass shards, to cut the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:23.760
microchip out of my arm. They might object, but&nbsp;
this will make it impossible for Tonegawa to cheat&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:28.400
even after my heart rate has calmed down. He lays&nbsp;
down his first card, and the kid's fight heart&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:32.800
rate is affecting his sensors. Nervous, the man&nbsp;
isn't sure what card to choose, but when they flip&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:37.920
their cards, the first turn ends in a draw. Kaiji&nbsp;
confidently plays his next card when the host&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:42.960
notices the blood stain, he remembers that Kaiji&nbsp;
bled on his slave and citizen cards earlier so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:48.160
there's a 50% chance it's the slave. The man puts&nbsp;
on a citizen hoping to win, but the turn ends in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:52.640
yet another draw. The next card he plays doesn't&nbsp;
have a blood stain, so it should be a citizen,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:57.360
but he's not sure, so he decides to play it safe&nbsp;
and it's another draw. With two cards remaining&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:01.840
Kaiji here places another card with a blood stain&nbsp;
and Tonegawa here thinks it must be the slave,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:06.080
but realises that this could be a trick. If&nbsp;
the kid might have switched his slave for a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:11.120
citizen card at the beginning of the match, then&nbsp;
both blood stain cards were actually citizens.

00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:15.840
Tonegawa here plays his emperor card confident&nbsp;
that he's won, but Kaiji here has outplayed him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:20.640
he's just won the game and it's taken Tonegawa&nbsp;
here completely by surprise. He tricked the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:24.800
man into thinking he swapped his card when he&nbsp;
actually never changed them. Having lost the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:28.880
match, the host is sentenced to a lifetime of&nbsp;
working underground like all the other losers,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:33.440
and Kaiji receives all the money he was promised.&nbsp;
Later he goes out to celebrate with the loan shark&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:37.760
over dinner and he gives her the money he owes,&nbsp;
but as they toast to his new and improved life,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:42.720
he suddenly blacks out. Okay, this woman should&nbsp;
not be trusted because she's already tried to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:46.160
screw you over and now that you have lots of&nbsp;
money, there's an even greater chance of that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:50.480
happening. If you're going to let a woman take&nbsp;
this much money away from you then at least make&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:54.800
her do it through an alimony settlement after&nbsp;
a long and unhappy marriage. When he wakes up,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:58.480
he finds the loan shark is gone and she's&nbsp;
stolen all his money, the only thing she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:02.640
left him is a loose change with a message&nbsp;
saying she's cleared his debt with interest.

00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:07.360
Kaiji walks the city a free man, but he's&nbsp;
got no idea that the games have only begun.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:11.120
