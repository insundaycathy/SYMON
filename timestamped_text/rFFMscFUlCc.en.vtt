00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:01.470
Welcome to Moviecaps.

00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:07.279
Today I will show you a Drama, Crime, Biography
film from 2016, that's based on a true story,

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:08.570
titled Snowden.

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:10.269
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:12.280
Watch out and take care.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.000
It is 2004.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.170
Edward Snowden is doing military training
in Fort Benning, Georgia.

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:21.060
One morning when jumping out of bed he breaks
his leg.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.020
The doctor explains that he has been walking
on 2 broken legs for weeks and that his bones

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.120
are filled with microfractures.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:31.180
Ed asks when he would be able to resume training,
but the doctor says that if he ever lands

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.450
on those legs again his bones will turn to
powder and says that he will authorize administrative

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:36.980
discharge.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.140
Fast forward to 2006.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:44.140
Since he cannot do field work, Ed decides
to join the intelligence division of the CIA.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.690
He is assessed by the Senior Instructor, Corbin
O'Brian.

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.260
Ed explains that most of his family has worked
for the government and that he truly wants

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:52.960
to serve the people.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.540
Seeing that Ed is highly intelligent and motivated,
Corbin accepts him into his class at "The

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.370
Hill", a CIA training center in Virginia.

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.259
While searching for his class, he meets Hank
Forrester, who is working on an encryption

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:08.880
machine called Sigaba, which is a successor
to Enigma and has never been cracked.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.060
Hank is an engineer, instructor and counselor
for the trainees on the base.

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.130
The two have a geeky banter between them before
Hank sends him off to class.

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.080
In the first lesson, Corbin has the class
take a proficiency test to create a covert

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:26.450
communications network to be deployed in their
hometown, backed up, destroyed and restored.

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.240
The average completion time is 5 hours and
if you take more than 8 hours, you fail.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.069
Ed finishes the test in 38 minutes and Corbin
is impressed.

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:39.610
At a coffee shop in Washington, Ed finally
meets his online girlfriend Lindsey.

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.109
The two go for a walk and along the way she
takes a few photos.

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:46.249
When asked, Ed says he works for the State
Department.

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:50.670
She says they do not have an office in Virginia,
which is where he always visits her website

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:51.670
from.

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.399
She understands that he cannot disclose where
he works.

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:57.130
He's surprised she knows how to do an IP trace.

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.539
During the afternoon, they exchange political
views as they walk through a peaceful protest

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:04.959
against the policies of President Bush and
the recent explosions.

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:08.479
They seem to have opposing views, but still
get along well.

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.489
Back in class, Corbin shows a newspaper article
that says, "Bush lets US spy on callers without

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:14.569
courts."

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:17.700
He asks if it's constitutional to bypass the
courts.

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.110
One student says that the 4th Amendment prevents
searches and seizures without a warrant.

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.750
Corbin reasons that sometimes the warrants
have to be issued by secret courts so they

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.120
don't tip off the suspects.

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.120
After class, Hank tells Ed that he used to
be a top NSA operative.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.480
He managed to develop an algorithm for only
3 million dollars which analyzes terabytes

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.140
of data that would take a human hundreds of
years.

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.200
It distinguishes between domestic and foreign
threats and encrypts the irrelevant information

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.180
so people can keep their privacy.

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.040
They did not use it and instead developed
a program modeled after his without filters

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.739
or automation that cost 4 billion dollars.

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:56.850
Later, he asks Corbin if all intelligence
programs are specifically targeted, and he

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.000
confirms.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.359
Corbin believes that the biggest threats will
come from foreign hackers and that without

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:05.349
minds like Ed's, the country will be torn
apart and that sending him to fight wars over

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:07.549
sand and oil would be a waste.

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:11.900
Ed is taken aback by his honesty and Corbin
says that you do not have to agree with politicians

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.280
to be a patriot.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.290
The year is 2007 and Ed is now working in
Geneva with diplomatic cover to maintain CIA

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.480
's computer security network.

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.050
His supervisor is not pleased that he hacked
their HR website.

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:27.200
Ed reasons that it is his job to find vulnerabilities.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.920
The man says that he was not asked to do this
and that Ed now has a derog on his file.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:37.049
Later, as he is shredding some disks, Gabriel
approaches him and takes him into his office.

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:40.920
Ed is hesitant because he's only allowed to
see the finished file, but Gabriel reasons

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.219
that it doesn't make a difference if he sees
how it's put together.

00:03:44.219 --> 00:03:49.099
He logs into X keyscore and types in some
keywords and receives messages in return.

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:53.439
Ed asks how this is possible, and he explains
that the system works like Google, but also

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:58.139
searches everyone's private data like emails,
chats and text messages.

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:02.189
Ed is at a high-level lunch with an undercover
CIA Agent who informs him that Corbin has

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:06.340
given him clearance to begin field operations
and that he is tasked with spotting potential

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.540
targets for illegal activity.

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.749
His social skills are not the best so he fails
miserably.

00:04:11.749 --> 00:04:14.989
Lindsey sees this and sets him up with a banker
named Marwan.

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:20.120
Later, Gabriel looks up Marwan and says he
is the cleanest Pakistani he has ever seen,

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.950
with no shady connections.

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:25.150
Ed asks if they could check his family and
Gabriel clicks on his sister-in-law.

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:30.330
A video pops up and Gabriel says it's live
from her laptop, which was turned off, but

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.680
the camera and microphone were activated by
the program.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.720
Ed is shocked and says to stick with the family
in Geneva.

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.420
Gabriel looks up Marwan's daughter, he does
not need a warrant and can look up anyone.

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:45.160
He looks at her Facebook account and finds
out her boyfriend is cheating on her and he

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.420
and his mother are here illegally.

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:52.000
The CIA agent says that Marwan's bank handles
Russian and Saudi money, and Ed is shocked

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.090
that things are moving so fast.

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:57.970
Marwan says that his daughter's boyfriend
has been deported and she took too many sleeping

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.100
pills but she's alright.

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:04.580
When they leave, Marwan is drunk and the CIA
Agent instructs Ed to call the police and

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:08.470
tell them he saw Marwan driving so he can
be put in jail for a week.

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:12.680
They will then offer him a deal he can't refuse
because he needs to be with his family.

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:16.840
Ed refuses and the CIA agent says he will
call the police himself.

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.580
Ed tries to stop him but gets threatened.

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:24.000
Some time later, Ed has put tape on every
webcam and when Lindsey asks why, he says

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.500
some Russian hackers might be watching them.

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:30.230
She takes it off and says it's creepy, but
it does not bother her because she has nothing

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:31.380
to hide.

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:35.560
He also tells her that he resigned from CIA
due to personal differences.

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:36.690
It is 2009.

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:41.290
Ed works for the NSA at Yokota Air Base in
Tokyo, Japan.

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:45.160
He is working on a backup system called "Epic
Shelter" in case some of their facilities

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:46.360
get destroyed.

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:50.900
When Japanese officials show up, he shows
them the live drone feeds which they love.

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:54.930
The NSA asks for their help to spy on the
Japanese, but it's against their laws so they

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:56.320
don't approve.

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:59.050
The NSA tapped the entire country anyway.

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:04.420
They also slipped malicious code into their
power grids, dams, hospitals, and other infrastructure

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:08.230
so they can just shut everything down when
they are no longer allies.

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:12.710
They did the same thing in Mexico, Germany,
Brazil, and Austria.

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:17.350
They also spy on world and industry leaders,
tracking their business deals and sex scandals

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:20.320
to give the US leverage in negotiations.

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:24.480
Ed realizes that this is actually about economic
and social control and that they are just

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.730
using radicalism as an excuse.

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:30.230
The only thing he is protecting is the supremacy
of the government.

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:32.340
After that he worked on radical watch.

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:35.900
He watched many Americans and had to keep
reminding himself that he could prevent a

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.840
dirty explosive attack and save thousands
of lives.

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:43.080
He had to watch not only the bad guys, but
also their contacts and everyone they interact

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:44.080
with.

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:48.970
3 steps from anyone with 40 contacts is a
list of 2.5 million people, the vast majority

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:51.200
of whom are regular people.

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:56.360
The NSA tracks every cell phone in the world,
not just those of radicals, but of everyone.

00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:00.760
Japan was difficult for him and Lindsey because
he was not allowed to talk about work.

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:05.420
One day he sees her editing lewd pictures
of herself and says she should delete them.

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:09.370
She asks if it's the Russian hackers again,
but he says it's classified and he cannot

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:12.590
talk about it because it's an issue of national
security.

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:17.310
She feels isolated because he works 12 hour
days and comes home depressed and miserable.

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:19.940
They get into an argument and she goes back
to the US.

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:24.610
3 months later he returns to the US and they
get back together, with him promising her

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:26.160
to change.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:29.730
Ed goes back to work for the CIA as Solutions
Consultant.

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:33.480
He was glad to be back in the States, but
as he kept working he learned more and more

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:38.250
disturbing facts, like when 3 high-ranking
NSA officials filed complaints about the abuse

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:42.360
and overreach of surveillance systems, they
were met with serious backlash such as the

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:44.460
FBI raiding their homes.

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:48.280
And when a whistleblower turned to the press,
seeing that his attempts to change the system

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:52.540
from within were futile, he was charged under
the Espionage Act to send a message to anyone

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:54.070
who would try the same.

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:57.520
The entire intelligence community was shocked
by this.

00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:59.370
Ed is out hunting with Corbin.

00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:03.590
He is told about a new program in Hawaii,
spying against the Chinese.

00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:07.750
When Ed raises concerns about mass surveillance,
Corbin states that there has not been a World

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:11.700
War 3 because they have generally used their
power for the good of the world.

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:15.791
Corbin also says that people already catalog
their lives on the web but Ed says that they

00:08:15.791 --> 00:08:19.860
only share part of it and do not know that
the rest is being monitored.

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:23.820
Corbin introduces him to Jim Lowell, Deputy
Director of the NSA.

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:27.410
Jim praises Ed's work on Epic Shelter and
says it is brilliant.

00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:31.830
As Corbin and Jim talk, Ed learns that Epic
Shelter is already being used to improve drone

00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:33.780
pilot response times.

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:37.340
With this new job in Hawaii he would have
even more access.

00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:39.700
Ed takes another lie detector test.

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:44.710
When asked if he has used programs he's unauthorized
for, she seems to catch him in a lie.

00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:49.010
At home, Ed tells Lindsey about his job offer
in Hawaii and tells her that he will do whatever

00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:50.920
they both deem necessary.

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:54.020
He goes back to the kitchen but collapses
and has a seizure.

00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:58.710
The doctor says it's epilepsy, prescribes
him medication, and recommends him to rest.

00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:03.460
In the parking lot outside the hospital, Lindsey
decides that Hawaii would be good for Ed because

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:06.470
it might be less stressful due to the warmer
climate.

00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:08.030
It is 2012.

00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:11.820
Ed arrives at his new job in Hawaii to counter
spy on the Chinese.

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:14.480
When he walks in, there's a thorough security
check.

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:18.260
Gabriel, who has been working there for 3
years, notices him.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.540
They work in a secret underground base.

00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:25.010
Gabriel leads him into his office and introduces
him to his boss Trevor, and Patrick who will

00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:26.470
be working with him.

00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:29.540
They watch live drone strikes of suspected
radicals.

00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:31.780
Ed's job is to geolocate them.

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:35.540
They track the "bad guys" cellphones, sometimes
just the sim card.

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:39.140
Ed asks how they know the bad guy is carrying
the phone and Patrick says they don't but

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:43.150
Trevor interrupts him and says they get the
information from people in the field.

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:47.090
They say that the program is called Epic Shelter
and Ed says that he built it and that he had

00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:51.710
another use in mind - to create a centralized
database for all the intelligence programs

00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:53.040
called "Heartbeat".

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:57.260
On a hiking trip with Lindsey, he admits that
he hasn't been taking his epilepsy medication

00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:00.570
because it makes him groggy and he needs to
be sharp for work.

00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:04.100
She asks what makes his job more important
than his life.

00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:07.850
One day at work, everyone in the office is
watching a live Congress meeting where the

00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:12.360
subject of government spying and data surveillance
is addressed and lied about.

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:16.640
Ed shows his coworkers the number of emails
and Skype calls Heartbeat has indexed by country

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:17.830
so far.

00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:21.850
They are shocked to find that they are collecting
more data on US citizens than on countries

00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:23.080
like Russia.

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:26.780
Patrick tells him to be careful because he
could be seen as rocking the boat.

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:31.210
Trevor walks in on them and tells Ed not to
let anyone unauthorized in anymore.

00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:36.000
Some time later, Corbin tells Ed he did a
good job tracking down 200 Chinese IPs in

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.610
his first 4 months.

00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:38.790
Also heartbeat.

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:42.850
Corbin knows he lied on the last polygraph
and asks him the same question.

00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:45.790
Ed admits that he checked whether Lindsey
was cheating on him.

00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:49.790
Corbin assures that she hasn't cheated on
him and Ed realizes that his girlfriend and

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:51.780
he are being actively monitored.

00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:55.940
He goes home and tells this to Lindsey and
instructs her to use encrypted email.

00:10:55.940 --> 00:11:00.010
He also suspects the house may be bugged and
suggests for her to go back to Maryland, but

00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:03.410
she decides to stay as it would look suspicious
otherwise.

00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:06.080
The next day he goes to work with a Rubik's
Cube.

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:10.570
He sits down and, while Patrick is distracted,
starts copying all the heartbeat data onto

00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:11.920
an SD card.

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:15.950
Shortly after he finishes, they come back
and he drops the SD card.

00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:19.010
Patrick notices it and steps on it so Trevor
doesn't.

00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:22.710
Ed tells him in sign language that they may
never see eachother again.

00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:25.440
He hides the SD card in the Rubik's Cube.

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:29.530
When he goes through security, he tosses the
cube to a guard and gets it back after being

00:11:29.530 --> 00:11:32.640
scanned so he manages to smuggle the data
out.

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:37.100
He emails a journalist and they arrange to
meet at The Mira Hotel in Hong Kong.

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:41.000
Over the coming days he and a couple journalists
slowly release information about government

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.140
surveillance.

00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:47.190
On June 9th, 2013, he officially reveals himself
as the one who leaked the information to avoid

00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:49.810
a witch hunt among the other employees.

00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:54.090
His passport got revoked while he was in Russia,
on his way to Latin America.

00:11:54.090 --> 00:11:58.590
He got stuck there and Russia granted him
asylum, so he has been living there ever since.

00:11:58.590 --> 00:12:02.750
The US even grounded the Bolivian president's
plane because they suspected Snowden was on

00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:04.000
board.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.400
Snowden is willing to face a fair trial, but
as long as the Espionage Act is used against

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:10.720
whistleblowers, that's not possible.

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:14.880
If he had the chance to do it all over again,
he would, because it has sparked a public

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:19.190
debate, and the ability to question the government
and hold it accountable is one of the principles

00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:25.080
upon which the United States of America was
founded.

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:26.080
The End.

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:27.080
Thank you for watching!
