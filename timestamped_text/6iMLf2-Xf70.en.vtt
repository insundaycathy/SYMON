00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:04.300
Hello everyone, this is Mr. Brain Junkie here,
and today we will be talking about a science

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:10.500
fiction fantasy film called Full Metal Alchemist,
be ready for some spoilers ahead!

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.980
Somewhere far away from the city, a mother
is putting up the blankets for her children.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.240
An assortment of items are combined together
in the transmutation circle by two brothers

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.140
and they rush to their mother, proudly displaying
their achievements.

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.310
The mother hugs them warmly, to show them
her love, but when the boys leave to play,

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.640
she drops to floor suddenly and dies as a
result of an unknown sickness.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.719
Not willing to lose their mother forever,
the brothers plan to transmute the woman into

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:39.999
existence by combining every single element
that makes up the human body.

00:00:39.999 --> 00:00:44.670
They put the materials in the center of the
alchemy circle and begins performing the ritual.

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.120
A large amount of energy begins gathering
inside the house, and the brothers realize

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.960
that something is very wrong.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.980
The house is ripped open by the conjuring
powers and the two are lifted into the air

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.059
one by one, as they scream hopelessly for
each other's name.

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:03.629
Many years later in the city of Reole, The
older brother Edward is chasing after a priest

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.619
with a mysterious red stone.

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:09.920
The magical rock allows him to use alchemy
without drawing any transmutation circles,

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.540
and Edward is force to run away from the rising
stone pillars.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.340
The man then summons multiple monsters using
the stones around him and orders them to attack,

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.350
but the young alchemist conjures a spear and
proceeds to destroy the creatures one by one.

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.630
Another person in full armor rushes in and
kills the creatures using his bare hands,

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.060
as he throws the monsters around and breaks
them into pieces.

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.350
However, the man's helmet gets knocked to
the floor and reveals that the armor is empty

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:36.490
inside.

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.159
Edward also shows that he has prosthetic limbs
after destroying the monsters, and is recognized

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.570
as the famous soldier known as the full metal
alchemist.

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.380
The two chase the man into the population
center, and the main character punches the

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.340
man with his prosthetic arm, knocking the
stone away from the fingers.

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.619
The military led by colonel Mustang arrive
and apprehends both of them in order to control

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:58.990
the situation immediately.

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.149
Edward shouts for the colonel to give him
the rock which is called the philosopher's

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:06.869
stone, but Mustang lights the object on fire
as it melts away, showing that it's no more

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.250
than a fake.

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.110
Edward becomes disheartened as he's been looking
for the stone for a long time, but the suit

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.330
of armor tries to comfort him and reveals
that he's actually the younger brother named

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:17.330
Alphonse.

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.120
The priest takes the opportunity to run away
from the soldiers, as the colonel takes Edward

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.010
back to the headquarter, leaving Alphonse
behind to clean up the mess.

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.910
What the people don't realize is that they
are being watched by three mysterious figures

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.420
who clearly show great interest in in the
fight that just occurred.

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.390
Back at the military headquarters, colonel
Mustang is trying to convince Edward that

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.360
the real philosopher's stone doesn't exist,

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.000
but the young man refuses to accept this as
the object he encountered displayed immense

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.030
powers.

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.970
Mustang argues by saying that the stone was
only an amplifier, not something that can

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.940
achieve human transmutation,

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.370
which is what Edward desires to do as he desperately
wants to regains his brother's body and his

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:55.700
missing limbs.

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.950
Their arguments are interrupted by captain
Hughes as he accompanies general Hakuro to

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:00.950
the room.

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.090
The senior officer greets the young man warmly
as he's heard numerous things about the full

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:10.290
metal alchemist and desires to meet with Alphonse
who's a living suit of armor.

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.790
After the meeting, captain Hughes accompanies
Edward as he advices him to listen to the

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:15.790
colonel,

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.330
but he also reveals that he's sent here from
the central command so that he may conduct

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.810
an inspection, as there are suspicious things
happening in this military base.

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.120
Their conversation is interrupted by Edward's
childhood friend Winry, who rushes over to

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.970
examine his prosthetic arm and complains about
it's damage and how she has to fix it again.

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.310
On the other side, the priest from before
is meeting with the three mysterious people

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.120
and reveals that they are in fact working
together.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.210
He blames his failure on the stone that he
received which is clearly a fake, but the

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:48.820
woman who's name is Lust ridicules him for
believing that there's actually a real philosopher's

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:49.820
stone.

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:54.640
her accomplice, Envy walks towards the priest
and transforms into him, while the woman extends

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.680
her claws and kills the old man immediately.

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.620
The other large man who they call Gluttony
opens his mouth and devours the dead body

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:02.960
in one shot.

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:07.710
At night, Edward begins to dream about his
earlier life when he first attempted to transmute

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:09.110
his mother through alchemy.

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:13.310
He was bought into a dimension in front of
the gate of truth, where all knowledge in

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.370
the universe lies within.

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.441
Edward also meets another entity who claims
to be god, and opens the gate for the young

00:04:19.441 --> 00:04:22.720
man where numerous hands pull him inside the
doorway.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.660
The man begins seeing the truth of the universe,
and eventually his mother from far away, as

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.890
he desperately tries to reach out for her.

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:34.130
Suddenly, he's brought back to the white room,
but now he has obtained vast amounts of the

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:38.200
knowledge about alchemy including the process
of human transmutation.

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:43.030
However, Edward begins noticing one of his
leg disappearing as it transfers onto the

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:47.430
mysterious deity who tells him that this is
part of the equivalent exchange.

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:51.570
He wakes up in the living room missing one
leg, and notices that his brother Alphonse

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:53.190
was taken as well.

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:57.690
He looks over at the alchemy circle and is
shocked to sees the monstrosity that he created

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:00.540
which resembles nothing close to his mother.

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:04.101
Edward knocks over the suit of armor in the
living room and demands to have his brother

00:05:04.101 --> 00:05:06.860
back as he begins to transmute once more.

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:11.000
The deity calls the man a fool for coming
back here as it slowly takes possession of

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.400
his arm as well.

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:17.110
The main character wakes up sweating profusely
as his brother watches over him, revealing

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:20.250
that he's been having the same dream for a
long time.

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:24.920
The next day, colonel Mustang takes the brothers
to meet an alchemist name Tucker at the order

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:26.070
of the general,

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:30.110
as the man believes that this will help Edward
in his quest of searching for the philosopher's

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:31.110
stone.

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:36.060
They arrive at the mansion and meets the scientist
along with the daughter Nina and their dog

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:37.060
Alexander.

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:40.530
Apparently the alchemist is very stressed
right now because of the upcoming examination

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:44.230
from the military which will determine his
usefulness to the organization.

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:49.760
He shows Edward the Chimeras that he created
by fusing different animals into one creature.

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:53.950
Tucker explains that he was able to make a
talking Chimera 2 years ago which gave him

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:58.560
the position as a state alchemist, but the
creature only spoke three words before eventually

00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:59.560
dying.

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:03.360
Through their conversation, Ed reveals that
he sacrificed his arm in order to bind his

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.160
brother's soul into the armor,

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:10.060
but because of that, Alphonse lost his memories
about what happened during the human transmutation

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:12.730
where he also looked into the gate of truth.

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:17.110
Tucker offers to help the young man by promising
to recover his brother's memories and perhaps

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:19.340
finding out a way to restore their bodies.

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:23.970
They leave Alphonse behind with Tucker and
arrives at the train station, after receiving

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:28.120
a lead about a scientist named Doctor Marcoh,
who may know more about the philosopher's

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:29.120
stone.

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.850
They head towards the town where the doctor
was last seen, and the girl was able to spot

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:37.110
a man that resembles who they're looking for,
rushing off the train immediately.

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:41.210
The two follows the trail to a hospital and
enters the building, only to be shot at by

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:44.160
the doctor who thinks that they are from the
military.

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:49.530
Edward reacts quickly, disabling the gun before
anyone got hurt and knocks the man unconscious.

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:53.660
After Marcoh wakes up, Edward demands to know
the truth about the philosopher's stone, but

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:57.699
the doctor refuses to help him stating that
it's for his own good.

00:06:57.699 --> 00:07:01.640
Suddenly, the man notices something wrong
and shoots behind the two, revealing that

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:04.310
lust was spying on them this whole time.

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:08.850
The woman continues to walk towards the doctor
as he fires again, but her wounds heal very

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:11.750
quickly and she pins the man onto the wall.

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:15.500
Edward tries to help but gets pushed back
as the woman throws him onto the wall along

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:17.020
with the girl as well.

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:20.240
She then stabs Marcoh through the heart and
vanishes.

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:24.710
Edward rushes toward the old man to try and
save him, but before the doctor dies, he reveals

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:28.850
that the truth about the stone's origins can
be found within laboratory 5.

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:32.669
The main character rushes to board the train
immediately and gets back to Tucker's house

00:07:32.669 --> 00:07:36.990
the next day, only to find that everyone is
missing inside the building.

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:41.530
He eventually finds the alchemist on the second
floor and the man reveals his newest creation,

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:44.120
a Chimera that's capable of speaking.

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:48.690
Edward examine the creature closely as it
begins talking and realizes the terrifying

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:50.900
truth about it's origins.

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:54.530
Tucker has created the Chimera by using his
own daughter and their dog,

00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:59.040
and it's also revealed that his first Chimera
that spoke was a result of experimenting on

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:02.370
his own wife, who disappeared around the same
time.

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:06.389
Edward charges towards the man and punches
him continuously with anger, but Alphonse

00:08:06.389 --> 00:08:10.910
appears just in time and was able to stop
his brother from killing Tucker.

00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:15.560
The military led by Colonel Mustang arrives
,taking everything in the house for evidence

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:19.440
and apprehends the mad scientist for committing
human experimentation.

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:23.100
Edward laments in the rain with his brother,
feeling extremely powerless.

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:27.540
He questions how he can restore their bodies
if he can't even save the life of the little

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:28.540
girl.

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:32.869
He spends the next three days inside the library
with the help of captain Hughes and his lieutenant

00:08:32.869 --> 00:08:36.469
Ross, trying to figure out the location of
laboratory 5,

00:08:36.469 --> 00:08:40.599
but they are unable to find any clues, nor
the existence of doctor Marcoh.

00:08:40.599 --> 00:08:44.029
The general interrupts their research and
claims that he knows the location that they

00:08:44.029 --> 00:08:45.339
are looking for.

00:08:45.339 --> 00:08:50.180
According to Hakuro, laboratory 5 is a nickname
given to the cannery in the military that's

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:52.009
no long operational.

00:08:52.009 --> 00:08:56.350
Not asking any further questions, Edward rushes
out of the door towards the the facility before

00:08:56.350 --> 00:08:57.999
the captain can stop him.

00:08:57.999 --> 00:09:02.209
They arrive at the building quickly, but the
three are not able to find anything unusual

00:09:02.209 --> 00:09:04.230
about this location.

00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:08.610
At the same time, Captain Huges notices a
pattern on the map regarding the four laboratories

00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:10.540
preceding laboratory 5,

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:14.939
forming what appears to be a transmutation
circle that engulfs the entire city.

00:09:14.939 --> 00:09:19.550
The captain figures out the location of final
laboratory by completing the geometry and

00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:23.060
realizes that it's located in the prisoner
of war camp.

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:27.529
Suddenly he hears someone behind him and slowly
turns around, only to see that lust has made

00:09:27.529 --> 00:09:29.689
it inside the military building.

00:09:29.689 --> 00:09:34.339
He immediately recognizes her tattoos on the
chest, indicating that she's a homunculus

00:09:34.339 --> 00:09:37.290
meaning that she was artificially created
using alchemy.

00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:41.610
The woman plans to kill the captain for knowing
too much, but he's able to survive her attack

00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:43.839
and escape the room just in time.

00:09:43.839 --> 00:09:47.519
The Captain rushes to call the Colonel on
the pay phone, to tell him about the secrets

00:09:47.519 --> 00:09:48.670
of the military,

00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:53.029
but feels a presence approaching from behind
and turns around, only to see that Mustang

00:09:53.029 --> 00:09:54.980
is pointing a gun towards him.

00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:59.399
The man tries to fight back, but the colonel
morphs into his wife which shocks the captain,

00:09:59.399 --> 00:10:01.749
and the assassin shoots him immediately.

00:10:01.749 --> 00:10:06.180
The man turns back into Mustang and walks
away, as the bystanders run away after witnessing

00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:07.180
the murder.

00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:11.390
Luckily, the captain was able to tell the
real colonel through the phone about the location

00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:14.839
of laboratory 5, before finally passing away.

00:10:14.839 --> 00:10:19.540
At the same, Edward leaves the cannery with
the group, only to be arrested by the military

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:23.709
and held captative inside a room where he
finds lieutenant Hawkeye as well.

00:10:23.709 --> 00:10:27.920
She tells the alchemist that the military
is looking to capture the colonel after witnesses

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:32.360
saw him murdering the captain, and they are
held captive for being associated with the

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:33.360
man.

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:36.959
On top of that, the mad scientist Tucker has
somehow escaped as well.

00:10:36.959 --> 00:10:41.139
However, the two are quickly able escapes
the facility by tricking the guards into the

00:10:41.139 --> 00:10:43.079
room and knocking them out.

00:10:43.079 --> 00:10:47.110
Hawkeye reveals that Mustang has told her
about laboratory 5 and is heading there right

00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:48.779
now by himself.

00:10:48.779 --> 00:10:52.509
Edward manages to enter the building with
Hawkeye and sees that the colonel is confronted

00:10:52.509 --> 00:10:55.879
by the military soldiers along side lieutenant
Ross.

00:10:55.879 --> 00:11:00.119
Mustang snaps his fingers and sets the lieutenant
on fire, while everyone looks in shock at

00:11:00.119 --> 00:11:01.389
the burning woman.

00:11:01.389 --> 00:11:05.639
The colonel tells the people to calm down
as the burnt body begins moving again, eventually

00:11:05.639 --> 00:11:08.110
recovering back without any damage.

00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:12.339
It turns out that Ross was impersonated by
Envy, and lust appears with Gluttony along

00:11:12.339 --> 00:11:13.819
side their accomplice.

00:11:13.819 --> 00:11:17.870
She tells Gluttony to take care of the soldiers,
and the big man begins transforming into a

00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:22.069
gigantic mouth, chasing away the the military
as they shoot in fear.

00:11:22.069 --> 00:11:25.800
She then shoots her claws at the colonel and
pierces him right through the stomach, before

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:27.630
leaving the man to die.

00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:32.509
Edward chases after the woman and eventually
enters a room with a giant transmutation circle.

00:11:32.509 --> 00:11:37.540
He notices Tucker pointing a gun towards him
after kidnapping both Alponse and Winry, threatening

00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:39.870
to kill them if Edward tries to attack.

00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:43.449
The man then takes out a philosopher's stone
and tells Edward that the military has been

00:11:43.449 --> 00:11:46.910
secretly making them using the prisoners in
this building.

00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:51.440
In fact, Doctor Marcoh and his team have made
thousands of the stones using human lives,

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:55.220
and if Edward wanted to regain the body of
his brother, he will need the sacrifice of

00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:56.670
other humans.

00:11:56.670 --> 00:12:01.139
Before he can finish talking, Tucker is stabbed
through the stomach by Lust from behind, who

00:12:01.139 --> 00:12:04.379
wants to silence the man before he reveals
too many secrets

00:12:04.379 --> 00:12:09.310
General Hakuro appears as well and was apparently
working with the woman for a long time.

00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:13.740
However, he decides to betray her plan by
attempting to use the stones to create numerous

00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:17.910
artificial humans in order to make an army
to rule this country.

00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:22.059
He begins injecting all the stones into the
lifeless bodies on the ceiling, and the creatures

00:12:22.059 --> 00:12:26.490
begin coming to life one by one, before dropping
down onto the floor.

00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:30.449
Thinking that he's made the ultimate army,
the General walks towards the monsters in

00:12:30.449 --> 00:12:34.709
excitement, but they begin attacking the man
all together and devours him alive.

00:12:34.709 --> 00:12:38.779
The colonel begins attacking the creatures
by engulfing them in flames, and notices that

00:12:38.779 --> 00:12:41.259
you can kill them by destroying their heads.

00:12:41.259 --> 00:12:44.950
He tells the lieutenant to gather the soldiers
and aim for the creatures heads, while he

00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:47.360
chases after the Homunculi.

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:51.420
Alphonse begins to recover the ability to
move as Edward protect both of them by fight

00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:52.839
off the monsters.

00:12:52.839 --> 00:12:57.920
The younger brother apologizes for being taken
hostage, as he hides Winry inside his armor,

00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:01.089
but Edward is glad that no body was hurt in
the process.

00:13:01.089 --> 00:13:05.089
At the same time, Lieutenant Hawkeye gathers
an army of soldiers to kill the monster's

00:13:05.089 --> 00:13:06.480
that are coming this way.

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:10.850
They all begin firing at the creatures and
knocking them onto the floor one by one after

00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:12.569
learning their weakness.

00:13:12.569 --> 00:13:16.950
Meanwhile, Colonel Mustang catches up with
the enemies and sets Envy on fire, but soon

00:13:16.950 --> 00:13:20.209
falls down as he struggles from the pain of
the previous wounds.

00:13:20.209 --> 00:13:24.399
The woman laughs at the man's suffering as
she claims to be immortal and shows him the

00:13:24.399 --> 00:13:28.420
philosopher stone that's within her, giving
her incredible healing abilities.

00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:32.540
She then attacks the colonel by using her
claws, but Edward intercepts and manages to

00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:35.059
hide them behind a stone wall he created.

00:13:35.059 --> 00:13:39.029
The main character realizes that the woman
is boasting about her abilities in order to

00:13:39.029 --> 00:13:44.180
by time for her comrade as he noticed that
Envy is no longer regenerating like before.

00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:48.749
Mustang takes the opportunity to set Envy
on fire again, and this time the homunculus

00:13:48.749 --> 00:13:51.519
dies permanently as he gets turned into dust.

00:13:51.519 --> 00:13:55.619
The woman attacks Edward by pinning him to
the floor, but a stone wall rises between

00:13:55.619 --> 00:13:57.529
them and destroys her claws.

00:13:57.529 --> 00:14:02.420
It turns out that Alphonse can also use alchemy
without a transmutation circle after recovering

00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:04.660
his memory from the gate of truth.

00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:09.299
Seeing that the enemy is wounded, Mustang
begins lighting the homunculus on fire continuously

00:14:09.299 --> 00:14:13.489
and grabs the philosopher's stone from her
chest, killing the woman by turning her into

00:14:13.489 --> 00:14:14.670
dust as well.

00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:18.839
Gluttony sees that all his comrades are dead,
and is forced to hide from the soldiers as

00:14:18.839 --> 00:14:19.839
he mourns.

00:14:19.839 --> 00:14:23.519
The colonel gives the philosopher's stone
to Edward so that he may finally make his

00:14:23.519 --> 00:14:24.639
brother human.

00:14:24.639 --> 00:14:28.269
The main character strikes his palms and sees
the gate of truth once again.

00:14:28.269 --> 00:14:31.970
He turns around and sees Alphonse's body,
no longer a boy anymore.

00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:36.209
The diety walks towards Edward and tells him
to trade, but the man refuses at the last

00:14:36.209 --> 00:14:40.430
moment, not willing to use human lives to
benefit his personal desires.

00:14:40.430 --> 00:14:44.339
He promises to come back for his brother as
he shouts Alphonse's name.

00:14:44.339 --> 00:14:49.269
The alchemist returns to his reality and apologizes
to his brother, but Alphonse forgives him

00:14:49.269 --> 00:14:52.519
as he also rejects using the stone, given
its origins.

00:14:52.519 --> 00:14:57.059
They all stare into the distance as the sun
finally rises once more.

00:14:57.059 --> 00:15:00.749
Edward looks at his brother as they sit inside
the train, promising to find a better way

00:15:00.749 --> 00:15:06.110
to bring back their bodies, as they continue
to venture forth into into their futures.

00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:07.869
