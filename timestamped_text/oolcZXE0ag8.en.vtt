00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:04.000
Welcome back for another 5 minute movie recap.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.600
Today, I'm going to give you an overview of the&nbsp;
2017 Irish horror drama film called 'The Cured'.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.720
There will be Spoilers ahead,&nbsp;
so please proceed with caution.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.240
Previously, a pandemic known as&nbsp;
the Maze Virus spread over Europe,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.760
converting its victims into violent, zombie-like&nbsp;
monsters. Ireland took the worst of the damage.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.560
After a treatment was identified, 75 percent of&nbsp;
individuals who were afflicted and could be caught&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:32.160
were treated and cured of the virus. The remaining&nbsp;
25% have shown to be resistant to the treatment.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.640
The Cured and the Infected are the two&nbsp;
factions. Despite widespread worries&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.800
that keeping the Infected alive may lead to&nbsp;
another epidemic, they are kept in captivity.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.200
Senan and Conor are two Cured patients&nbsp;
who have been placed in the same facility.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.400
Sergeant Cantor, their 'Rehabilitation Officer,'&nbsp;
has little trust in the Cured's ability to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.400
reintegrate into society without additional&nbsp;
bloodshed, and treats them with contempt.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.680
Senan meets up with Abbie, his sister-in-law,&nbsp;
who has a small boy named Cillian.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.320
Abbie inquires about her husband, Luke,&nbsp;
Senan's brother, who remains missing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.720
Though it is revealed in one of Senan's many&nbsp;
flashbacks that Conor infected Senan, who then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:14.240
killed Luke, in the house where Abbie still lives,&nbsp;
Senan claims ignorance of his fate. The Cured have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.880
vivid memories of their experiences when infected,&nbsp;
and many of them suffer from post-traumatic stress&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:24.560
disorder. Conor, a former lawyer with political&nbsp;
ambitions, is unable to find work and is rejected&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.200
by his family as a result of his diseased&nbsp;
behaviour. He creates the Cured Alliance,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.360
an underground movement dedicated to reclaiming&nbsp;
the civil freedoms that the Cured have lost.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.720
Despite the claims of a leading virologist that a&nbsp;
stronger vaccination for the Infected is virtually&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:44.080
created, the government plans to euthanize&nbsp;
the 25% (5,000 patients) who are infected.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.960
Senan gets a job at the hospital where the&nbsp;
Infected are confined and notices that they don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.760
seem to care about the Cured. The never-infected&nbsp;
suspect loudly that the Cured would love to see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.680
another epidemic of the Maze Virus since they&nbsp;
would be mostly resistant to its effects.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.200
This is a source of political&nbsp;
conflict in the society.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.160
Conor tries to persuade Senan to join the&nbsp;
Cured Alliance. Senan first refuses, but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.960
after witnessing society's animosity toward the&nbsp;
Cured, he joins the gang on an arson operation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.720
Conor maintains the targets are empty houses, but&nbsp;
when a soldier is murdered, Cantor accuses Senan&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.520
and Conor. Cantor confronts Abbie at her home&nbsp;
and informs her that the Infected are connected&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.640
telepathically and form groups like predatory&nbsp;
animals. He claims that the vaccination does not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.680
eradicate the Cured's predatory tendencies, and&nbsp;
that they are still dangerous. He shows Abbie a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:37.200
snapshot of Conor and Senan exploring the streets&nbsp;
together before becoming sick. In the photo,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:43.040
Conor looked to be guiding Senan in deadly deeds.&nbsp;
Later, Conor visits Abbie and tacitly acknowledges&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.200
that he and Senan killed her husband when they&nbsp;
were both sick during the outbreak's early days.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.240
Senan is confronted by Abbie, who kicks him&nbsp;
out. Conor has no remorse for what he has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:57.760
done in the past, and what he is doing now,&nbsp;
Senan realises. Senan aids Cantor in a sting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.720
operation to get Conor when he confesses to the&nbsp;
arson in public; however, Conor murders Cantor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.000
and flees. The Cured Alliance devises a strategy&nbsp;
to liberate the Infected from their captivity.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.040
The Infected move to the streets, murdering and&nbsp;
infecting fresh victims while wreaking havoc.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.720
The Irish Army has been sent. Senan comes upon&nbsp;
Abbie, who is desperately attempting to locate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:24.400
Cillian at his school. Senan saves Cillian but is&nbsp;
attacked by Conor, who thrashes him mercilessly.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:30.640
Conor is shot by a soldier, but he manages to&nbsp;
flee. Cillian gets bitten and afflicted as Senan,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.120
Abbie, and Cillian return to their&nbsp;
home. Senan, knowing he is immune,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.600
grabs Cillian and promises Abbie that he will&nbsp;
keep him safe until a new vaccination is ready.

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.520
A news report subsequently states&nbsp;
that order has been restored,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:48.720
despite the fact that 8,000 additional sick&nbsp;
persons have been captured. Promotional posters of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.920
Conor (as the Cured Alliance's voice) may be seen&nbsp;
during the announcement. Some Infected have gone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.320
into hiding, and the government is once again&nbsp;
considering euthanasia for the resistant 25%.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.720
Senan retreats into hiding with&nbsp;
Cillian, who has been infected.
