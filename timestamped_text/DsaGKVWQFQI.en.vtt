00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.520
Welcome back to Movie Recaps.
Today I will show you a thriller&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:08.960
film from 2016, titled The Girl on a Train.
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:14.320
This is a story about three women whose lives are&nbsp;
interconnected in a terrifying circle of lies,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.280
abuse, and death. Rachel has turned into a&nbsp;
sad drunk that lost her job over a year ago&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:24.080
because of her drinking problem. Now, she just&nbsp;
rides the same train every day, looking at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.480
houses along its route, imagining what the life&nbsp;
of one of the women that live in them is like.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.200
That woman is Megan. Rachel sees her life&nbsp;
as an absolute fantasy in which Megan is a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.640
perfect woman in a perfect relationship&nbsp;
and perfectly in love with her husband.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.880
This is not the case, however, as we&nbsp;
will find out in the course of the movie.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.120
Megan is a very troubled young woman&nbsp;
with a difficult past and a husband,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.840
Scott, who's a little bit too jealous when it&nbsp;
comes to her contact with others. But he isn't her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:55.040
only problem. She used to be a successful gallery&nbsp;
director, but now Megan is reduced to work as a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.480
nanny for one of her neighbors, Anna. Megan is&nbsp;
stuck in a situation she despises, infinitely sad&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.520
about what her life has turned into, being forced&nbsp;
into becoming a housewife and a mother. Anna is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:10.240
the image of that woman Megan wants to avoid. She&nbsp;
is the current wife of Rachel's ex-husband with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.280
whom she has a baby. Rachel keeps coming to their&nbsp;
house that she can see on her train ride as well,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.080
with one time even sneaking inside and taking&nbsp;
their baby. She keeps calling both the house and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:25.520
Tom, her ex, constantly. In the present, the&nbsp;
three women live completely different lives,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.200
but all surrounding the same axis in that&nbsp;
boring little town outside of New York.&nbsp;

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.360
Rachel lives with her friend Cathy who's&nbsp;
worried about her drinking and obsessing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.080
over her ex-husband and his new wife and baby.&nbsp;
She tells Rachel to stop calling them while she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.320
apologizes to Cathy for not being able to pull&nbsp;
herself together and move out of her place for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.960
the past two years. The only thing on her mind&nbsp;
is her past with Tom and their difficulty having&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:52.000
a baby which she really wanted. The next day,&nbsp;
Rachel goes back to her train, getting scolding&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.920
looks from her fellow passengers for being drunk&nbsp;
and looking at Megan's house when she sees her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.200
embracing and kissing another man that's not her&nbsp;
husband. He is actually Megan's shrink, Dr. Abdic,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.280
and what Rachel doesn't know about Megan, makes&nbsp;
her assume that she's having an affair with him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.200
and has her entire fantasy about her shattered&nbsp;
in an instant, thinking that she's throwing her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.160
beautiful life away. Rachel gets drunker and more&nbsp;
upset over the course of the day, correlating&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.080
Megan's supposed affair with the one her ex Tom&nbsp;
had with Anna before they even got divorced.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.800
She remembers his emails to her when she talks&nbsp;
to a random woman she gets drunk with at a bar.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.080
Later, she records herself and her newfound friend&nbsp;
cursing Anna out and then explaining how angry&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.000
she feels about Megan cheating on her husband,&nbsp;
making her want to go to her house and confront&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.360
her about it. Rachel eve explains in vivid detail&nbsp;
how she would beat her up if she went to see her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.160
On the train again, Rachel sees Megan's house&nbsp;
and exits the crowded train in a drunken state,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.600
registering one of the passengers she knows&nbsp;
from it, thinking he's following her to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.600
tunnel where she sees someone. She calls&nbsp;
out to the woman, calling her a whore.&nbsp;

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:55.520
Rachel wakes up the next day in a terrible state&nbsp;
after the previous drunken 24 hours. Her room is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.840
an absolute and disguising mess and to make it&nbsp;
even worse she has blood all over her hands,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.560
face, and clothes. She can hear her ex's voice&nbsp;
in her head, being mean to her and saying she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.280
should leave him and Anna alone. Rachel washes&nbsp;
up and tries to remember the previous day by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.440
looking at the recording she made on her phone&nbsp;
and scrambled images pop up into her mind from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.440
Megan in the tunnel and in her house as well&nbsp;
as the passenger from the train. She boards&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.680
the train again and recalls herself hurting Megan&nbsp;
the way she explained doing it on her recording.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:26.640
Rachel's memories are in absolute chaos and she&nbsp;
tries drawing them so she can put them together.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.280
Fearing what might have happened, she goes to&nbsp;
an AA meeting and confesses that this is just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.440
her first day, sharing that when she was married&nbsp;
she had her husband to tell her about the previous&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.400
nights and now no one can help her remember. Going&nbsp;
back on the train she sees Martha, the wife of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.680
Tom's old boss. Rachel remembers herself at one of&nbsp;
Martha's parties years ago when she made a scene,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.760
embarrassing her husband and probably costing&nbsp;
him his job, or at least that's what he tells her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.320
to remember. Her memories flood her mind, from&nbsp;
the time that she was still married to Tom and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:59.520
very violent toward him. Rachel comes back home to&nbsp;
Detective Riley and her partner waiting at Cathy's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:04.080
place for her. Riley asks her where she was that&nbsp;
Friday night and Rachel tells her that she wanted&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:09.920
to visit Tom, but decided that it was a bad idea&nbsp;
and got back home around 11. The detective notices&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.840
a 5-hour gap between the time she says she&nbsp;
got off the train and the time she got home.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:19.280
She shows Rachel a photo of Megan and tells her&nbsp;
that she's gone missing on that Friday. Rachel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:24.240
says that she doesn't know Megan nor has she seen&nbsp;
her. When the detectives leave, Cathy confronts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.560
her about the fact that she hasn't had a job for&nbsp;
a long time and she didn't tell her, but Rachel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.800
tells her not to worry about the rent because&nbsp;
she still has alimony money. The two of them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.880
argue about her getting so drunk that she lost her&nbsp;
memory when Cathy gets it in her mind that when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:42.000
people blackout as she did, they are capable&nbsp;
of terrible things. Suddenly, Rachel recalls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.960
seeing Megan with her shrink and runs off to tell&nbsp;
the detective. Riley, however, isn't impressed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.960
that Rachel now somehow knows Megan and she just&nbsp;
happened to be at the right place to witness her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:55.760
having an affair. Then, she tells Rachel that they&nbsp;
have eyewitnesses stating that a drunk woman was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:00.160
seen in the vicinity of Megan's house that night&nbsp;
and Riley suspects if Rachel might have mistaken&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.840
Megan for Anna because she also knows about&nbsp;
the previous incidents she has had with her.&nbsp;

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:09.520
In a flashback from some months earlier, we&nbsp;
see Megan in a therapy session with Dr. Abdic.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.560
She's telling him that Scott is&nbsp;
possessive and likes to own her,&nbsp;

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:16.560
but in an interesting way of presenting their&nbsp;
dialogue, the filmmakers will have us doubt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:21.440
if anything Megan is saying is true, just how we&nbsp;
doubt if anything Rachel is remembering is real.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.200
The doctor tells her that what Scott is&nbsp;
doing to her is a form of emotional abuse,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.080
but Megan seems to have accepted&nbsp;
it as a normal state of affairs.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:33.600
She, suddenly, confesses to her doctor that she&nbsp;
has feelings for him that are probably misplaced.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:38.320
Rachel, fearing what might have happened to&nbsp;
Megan and abruptly changing her mind about her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:43.120
idolizes her now that she's missing. She gets&nbsp;
the idea to talk to her husband and lies to him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.600
that she's Megan's friend to get through the doors&nbsp;
and get his trust. Rachel tells him that she saw&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:51.840
Megan kissing someone that day from the train and&nbsp;
Scott gets upset so he asks what he looks like.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:56.400
He offers Rachel a drink and she reluctantly&nbsp;
takes it, knowing it would get her right back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:01.360
where she started. Before she leaves, Scott asks&nbsp;
her if she would recognize the man if she saw&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:06.720
him and shows her a picture of Dr. Abdic. Rachel&nbsp;
can't tell at first, but as she thinks about it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:09.360
she says that he was the man on&nbsp;
the porch with Megan that Friday.&nbsp;

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.400
In another flashback about Megan, we see her&nbsp;
sleeping with someone, but with no clue who he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:19.040
actually is. Then, she has another session with&nbsp;
her shrink, talking to him about the subject&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:24.000
of getting a baby, then trying to avoid talking&nbsp;
about it by coming on to him. Back in the present,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.800
Dr. Abdic is getting arrested by the police and&nbsp;
Rachel begins to feel better, finding purpose in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:33.600
the search for Megan. However, Scott calls her and&nbsp;
tells her that the shrink was released after he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:37.360
pointed a finger at him, sharing with the police&nbsp;
everything that Megan had told him about her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:41.680
husband. The police are suspecting him now and&nbsp;
he thinks that they might have every reason to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:46.400
do so considering how he behaved when she went&nbsp;
missing. When Rachel leaves the house she runs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:50.880
into Tom and Anna and has another misinterpreted&nbsp;
flashback when he sees her and asks her to leave.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:55.680
Rachel remembers Anna being in the tunnel and&nbsp;
hitting her, but Tom doesn't want to go in it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:59.840
He tells her that they both know what she is&nbsp;
capable of, hinting at her supposed violent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:04.960
outbursts, and gets very angry when Rachel&nbsp;
mentions Megan. Sometime later, Rachel goes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:09.520
to see Dr. Abdic under the guise of looking&nbsp;
for therapy herself. She tells him about her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:13.840
blackouts and confesses that when someone reminds&nbsp;
her about what she has done during them, she feels&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:17.680
removed and disconnected from what happened&nbsp;
as if it wasn't her that did those things.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:22.720
Without the intention of doing so, Rachel opens up&nbsp;
to the doctor about how her alcoholism began and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:27.600
finally faces her own truth, that she's afraid&nbsp;
of what she might have done. Meanwhile, Anna&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:32.480
is also suspicious of Rachel and her intentions&nbsp;
towards them so she speaks to the police about it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:37.120
Detective Riley, though, doesn't see it the&nbsp;
same way as she does and in return creates&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:41.280
suspicion in Anna about Tom, prompting her&nbsp;
to do little investigations on her own.&nbsp;

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:46.960
One night, Rachel gets a visit from Scott. He&nbsp;
tells Rachel that Megan was pregnant and told&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:51.680
her doctor instead of him. Scott falls asleep&nbsp;
at Rachel's house and it becomes clear that she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:55.840
might have developed feelings for him or misplaced&nbsp;
whatever she thought Megan was feeling like her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:55.840 --> 00:08:01.440
own. In a flashback, we see the moment that Megan&nbsp;
tells Dr. Abdic about her pregnancy, but we also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:06.160
finally find out why she was so apprehensive about&nbsp;
having a child. She tells him that when she was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:10.560
17 years old she gave birth to a little girl and&nbsp;
loved being a mother because she loved her child.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:16.240
Unfortunately, the child drowned in an awful&nbsp;
accident that scared Megan forever. She and her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:20.880
boyfriend buried the baby in front of their house&nbsp;
then he left her with no warning. Rachel goes back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:25.520
to the shrink, probably more for herself than for&nbsp;
Megan, and tells him about the incident with Tom's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:30.320
and Anna's baby. She was drunk when she got inside&nbsp;
their house and when she saw the child she just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:34.560
wanted to hold it for a moment to see what it felt&nbsp;
like because she couldn't have one of her own.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:38.560
Anna, however, saw a different version of&nbsp;
the same story and believed that she would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:43.840
hurt the baby, even though Rachel never would.
Sometime later, Megan's partially decomposed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:49.680
body is found in the woods. The investigation is&nbsp;
no longer a missing person's case, but a homicide.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:54.080
At this point, we get to Anna's story. She&nbsp;
remembers Tom from before they got married&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:58.240
and they were having an affair while he was still&nbsp;
with Rachel. That thought gets her thinking about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:02.640
Rachel's violent tendencies and suspicious&nbsp;
about the possibility of her killing Megan.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:06.800
Tom reassures her that even though Rachel might&nbsp;
be a sad person, that she's completely harmless.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:12.080
Meanwhile, Rachel comes back home to find Scott&nbsp;
at her place, drinking and ready to confront&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:17.920
her about something. He offers her a beer, but she&nbsp;
refuses. Scott goes on to tell Rachel that Megan's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:23.440
baby wasn't his, nor Dr. Abdic's, and asks her if&nbsp;
she knew about a third man, but Rachel naturally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:28.160
doesn't know. Scott suspects as much because the&nbsp;
detectives had told him that she didn't even know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:32.880
Megan at all. He's rightfully upset for her lying&nbsp;
to him so she tries to explain that the reason&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:37.760
for that was only to help in the investigation.&nbsp;
Scott attacks her, then storms out of her place&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:42.240
and Rachel goes to the police to report him.&nbsp;
When she gets there, detective Riley happens&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:46.160
upon her and questions her about everything&nbsp;
instead, confronting her about all of her lies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:51.440
and misdirection. Riley still suspects Rachel so&nbsp;
she keeps asking her what happened that night.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:55.040
Rachel still doesn't know so she runs out&nbsp;
there before she can say anything else.&nbsp;

00:09:55.760 --> 00:10:00.240
In a flashback with Megan on the day that she&nbsp;
died, we see the real version of events that took&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:04.880
place on her porch with her shrink. He was simply&nbsp;
comforting her that she and her baby will be fine.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:09.760
In the present, Rachel goes back to drinking when&nbsp;
she sees the passenger from the train in the bar&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:14.080
that she's in and asks him why he was following&nbsp;
her that Friday because she saw him in the tunnel.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:16.800
The man tells her that he saw&nbsp;
her fall and wanted to help her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:21.440
but she told him to leave her alone. No matter&nbsp;
how much she pushes for answers he doesn't know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:25.680
anything else about what happened that night.&nbsp;
The conversation with him sends Rachel back on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:30.000
the spiral of doubting herself and believing&nbsp;
that she might be capable of killing someone,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.960
capable of killing Megan. She listens to the&nbsp;
recording again and decides to go to the police,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:39.680
leaving a note for Cathy with all her packed-up&nbsp;
possessions. When she enters the train, however,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:44.320
she sees Martha again. The woman is happy to&nbsp;
see her, not how she would expect it to be.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:49.680
Though, Rachel still apologizes to her for&nbsp;
acting the way she did all those years ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:53.840
Martha doesn't understand what Rachel is saying&nbsp;
and tells her the real story of what happened that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:58.880
night. Unlike the story Tom had fed her the next&nbsp;
day, Martha explains that during her party Rachel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:04.720
was drunk, but far from violent. In fact, she&nbsp;
even took a little nap in her room. Furthermore,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:08.880
Martha tells her that Tom was fired from his job&nbsp;
not because she embarrassed him, but because he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:13.760
slept with everyone in the office. Martha even&nbsp;
tells Rachel how sorry she felt for her being&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:19.200
married to him. Rachel suddenly remembers it all,&nbsp;
that Tom was the violent and abusive spouse taking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:24.080
his rage out on his alcoholic wife and making&nbsp;
her feel even worse about herself. That night,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:28.720
Anna continues to investigate Tom's things when&nbsp;
she finds a cell phone in his bag and charges it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:33.040
only to find out that it's a woman's phone. She&nbsp;
reads his texts to her which make it apparent that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:38.160
he was having an affair. When he comes back home,&nbsp;
Anna pretends that nothing is going on with her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:42.000
That night, Anna finds out that the phone&nbsp;
actually belonged to Megan and she throws it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.240
over the fence out of panic when she hears&nbsp;
him coming, Meanwhile, Rachel's memories keep&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:50.160
coming back to her and she remembers seeing&nbsp;
Megan in the tunnel the day she died, but the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:54.160
whole sequence of events is still fuzzy so she&nbsp;
goes back to the place where it all took place.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:59.600
Suddenly, Rachel remembers everything from seeing&nbsp;
Megan there to the man that picked her up. In her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:05.120
flashback, Tom comes over to her, pulls her aside,&nbsp;
and beats her up, then runs back to Megan and they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:10.320
drive off together. She even remembers being mean&nbsp;
to the passenger that was trying to help her.&nbsp;

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:15.120
Rachel has puzzled it all together, so she goes&nbsp;
back to Tom's and Anna's house the next day.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:19.360
Anna is playing with her baby in the yard and&nbsp;
freaks out when she sees her because Tom has also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:24.240
been feeding her the lie that Rachel is violent&nbsp;
throughout the years. She tells Rachel to go away,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:28.880
but she insists that Anna needs to leave because&nbsp;
Tom is dangerous and probably killed Megan.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:32.800
Anna doesn't want to leave him and keeps&nbsp;
resisting what Rachel is trying to tell her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:37.200
Tom appears and she confronts him about Megan so&nbsp;
he pulls her inside where the argument continues.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:41.280
Listening to Rachel recall her memory of&nbsp;
the night, Anna tells them that she found&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:46.640
Megan's phone. She asks Tom about the affair&nbsp;
and he confirms it. When Rachel sees how Tom&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:50.800
is treating Anna and the baby she tries to call&nbsp;
the police but he stops her and drags her to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:55.440
kitchen intending to get her to drink. Rachel&nbsp;
refuses, though he pours her one nonetheless.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.880
She keeps talking about how he&nbsp;
treated her and made her feel,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:03.920
finally getting it into Anna's mind. When Rachel&nbsp;
doesn't drink the vodka, he throws it in her face&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:08.880
then hits he over the head, knocking her out.
At the very end, we see what transpired to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:13.200
Megan after she got in the car with Tom. They&nbsp;
go to the woods together, where they usually&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:17.840
had their meetings and she tells him that she's&nbsp;
pregnant and unsure if the baby is his or not.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:22.080
Megan is actually happy about it after everything&nbsp;
that she's been through, but Tom tells her to get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:27.120
rid of it. However, she's not interested in&nbsp;
doing anything like that and argues with him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:31.520
Tom pushes her on a rock then kicks her and when&nbsp;
he pulls her body to hide it, Megan wakes up,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:36.240
so he ultimately kills her with a rock.
Back in the present, Tom is trying to manipulate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:40.160
Rachel into thinking that it's her fault Megan&nbsp;
died, but she knows better than to fall for his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:45.760
words and tries to run. He grabs her and tries to&nbsp;
strangle her under Anna's eyes. Rachel knocks him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:50.320
over and manages to escape, but when he follows&nbsp;
her out this time, she stabs him with a wine&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:55.520
opener. Anna comes out of the house and finishes&nbsp;
the job Rachel had started. They both killed him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:55.520 --> 00:14:01.120
together. Later in the police station, Rachel and&nbsp;
Anna give detective Riley the same story. Anna&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:06.000
says that Rachel was right about everything. In&nbsp;
the final image of the film, Rachel visits Megan's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.080
grave then rides the train again, sitting in a&nbsp;
different car and looking in the other direction.
