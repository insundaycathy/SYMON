00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:02.220
Hi, Mystery Recapped here.

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.850
Today, I'm going to explain a German-American
psychological thriller mystery film called

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:08.130
"Flight Plan."

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:09.500
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.418
Watch out and take care!

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.230
It is a tough night for Kyle Pratt.

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:22.350
Kyle is an American aircraft engineer recently
widowed by the death of her husband in Berlin.

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.990
She has to take her husband's body on a flight
to the US with her four years old daughter, Julia

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.130
To help her with her anxiety, Kyle takes pills
as prescribed by her doctor.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.380
The next morning, it is snowing outside, a
taxi is waiting for them to take them to the

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:37.690
airport.

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.260
While at the airport, Kyle loses Julia; she
panics.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.989
She sees strangers, couples, foreigners, adults.

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:46.820
But nobody kid-sized.

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.130
She turns again.

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:50.260
There's Julia, over by a sundries stand.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:55.100
With an angry tone, she advises her not to
wander around without her permission.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.100
Kyle and Julia will soon board a plane that
Kyle helped design.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.899
They are the first to enter the cabin.

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.739
Julia looks out her window.

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:06.030
Then she steams that window up with her breath
and draws a little heart in the steam with

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.850
her fingerâ€”a tiny, clumsy heart.

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.640
Then Kyle takes a nap.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.970
Awakening from her nap, she realizes that
Julia has disappeared from her seat.

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.740
Kyle tries to ask other passengers, but none
of the passengers recalls seeing her.

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.890
A flight attendant suggests that Julia might
be playing with children of her age.

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.680
Kyle walks down the aisle, trying to find
her, but still no sign of Julia.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.470
Kyle continues to look around with an unease
that's beginning to grow.

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.409
She rechecks their Row, where they'd fallen
asleep.

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:38.009
She looks under that blanket and finds the
one-armed bear.

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.880
But no Julia!

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.049
That's weird.

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:43.600
Julia wouldn't go anywhere without her bear.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.750
Then she contacts a flight attendant, Stephanie,
to help her find Julia.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.079
Stephanie agrees to help her and makes an
announcement of a missing child.

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:56.040
A moment later, however, to her surprise,
Stephanie tells her there is no record of

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.899
her daughter boarding the flight.

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.540
Kyle is confused.

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.310
She is very sure her daughter was there with
her, so she tries to prove it by showing her

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:04.490
boarding pass.

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.479
However, Kyle is unable to find Julia's boarding
pass.

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.329
And she also finds that her daughter's backpack
is missing from the overhead bin, which is

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:17.459
impossible because Julia couldn't have reached
up here by herself; she's not tall enough.

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:23.670
Seeing this situation, a Sky Marshall, Gene Carson, begins to monitor her while she's searching for her daughter

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.159
Kyle demands to see the captain, Marcus Rich,
to get him involved in the search for her daughter.

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:32.659
Hearing that there's no record of her daughter
boarding the flight, the captain asks if Kyle

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:34.980
is under any medication right now.

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.079
Kyle says that she was taking sleeping pills
to help her with anxiety due to her husband's

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:40.079
death.

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:44.180
Kyle further reveals that her husband died
falling from their roof six days ago, which

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.309
she refuses to believe was suicide.

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:50.529
The captain and the other crew members suspect
that Kyle has become unhinged by her husband's

00:02:50.529 --> 00:02:53.629
death and has imagined bringing her daughter
aboard.

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:57.010
Kyle insists on looking for Julia from nose
to tail.

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.459
Captain Rich reluctantly agrees and orders
the crew members to do a thorough search.

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:03.579
The lights in the cabin are turned on.

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:07.120
An announcement is made to all passengers
not to leave their seats.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.639
Stephanie goes down to the avionics section,
looking around, but still no four-year-old

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:13.120
girls.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.260
While Pratt is busy searching, she sees an
Egyptian.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.239
She confronts him as she recognizes him from
somewhere.

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:22.699
She tries to remember, but her brain's too
scrambled right now.

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:26.569
Kyle then asks the captain to look for Julia
in the cargo hold.

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:30.339
Captain Rich doesn't allow that; and angrily
states that there are hundreds of passengers

00:03:30.339 --> 00:03:34.249
on this flight who are NOT receiving any attention
at the moment because all flight attendants

00:03:34.249 --> 00:03:38.569
are busy conducting a search for a child that
none of them believe was ever on board.

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:40.420
Kyle doesn't take it well.

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.359
She then runs to the Egyptian.

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:46.480
She accuses the man of kidnapping her daughter,
as she now remembers that she saw him last

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.010
night, staring into her daughter's bedroom.

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:53.010
The man is annoyed at being accused; then,
he shows proof of receipt of the hotel where

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.730
he lived, which is nowhere near her apartment.

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.010
Then, chaos ensues.

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:01.069
Kyle forces the man to confess; they fight.

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:05.459
Carson, who is fed up with her behavior, states
that her husband's death makes more sense

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:06.459
now.

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:09.780
A couple of hours with her, and even he is
ready to jump.

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.879
Not long after, Captain Marcus receives a
wire from the hospital in Berlin that says

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:18.120
Julia was with her father when he fell off
the roof and also died of internal injuries.

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.079
Now, the crew believes she is delusional.

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:23.080
Kyle furiously denies it.

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.199
She is very sure that Julia is still alive
and still on the plane.

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:31.289
Carson now feels that Kyle is a threat by
making up such a story, so he handcuffs her

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:32.669
and keeps her in her seat.

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:38.229
A therapist, Lisa, approaches and tries to
console her, causing Kyle to doubt her own

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:39.229
sanity.

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:41.699
She now begins to accept her daughter's death.

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:45.791
However, she then notices that a heart Julia
had drawn earlier on the window next to her

00:04:45.791 --> 00:04:47.259
seat is real.

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:51.400
Kyle becomes increasingly convinced that something
weird is going on.

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.039
She then convinces the therapist to let her
use the bathroom.

00:04:55.039 --> 00:05:00.150
Instead of doing so, she climbs into the upper
compartment and sabotages the aircraft's electronics,

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:03.240
deploying the oxygen masks and interrupting
lighting.

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.669
All passengers and crews start to panic, but
Carson realizes that Kyle is the one behind this

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.470
She uses the chaos to take a dumbwaiter to
the lower freight deck.

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:14.639
She finds her husband's casket there.

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:20.240
She unlocks David's casket, suspecting Julia
is inside, but finds only her husband's body.

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.975
And nothing else.

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:26.900
Carson finds her, puts her in handcuffs, and
escorts her back, announcing that the flight

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:31.960
is making an emergency stopover at Goose Bay
Airport, where she will be taken into custody.

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.009
As she's escorted to her seat, one of the
passengers begins to APPLAUD.

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:38.509
The applause spreads, filling the Deck.

00:05:38.509 --> 00:05:41.330
Some others are staring at her, including
the Egyptian.

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:45.060
Kyle reaches the back row, where she stops
and sits there.

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:49.550
Kyle makes a final plea to Carson that she
needs to search the plane upon landing.

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:52.979
Carson considers for a moment, then decides
to speak to the captain.

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:57.219
However, instead of speaking to the captain,
he sneaks down to the freight deck.

00:05:57.219 --> 00:06:01.499
There, he removes two explosives and a detonator
concealed in David's (Kyle's husband) casket.

00:06:01.499 --> 00:06:05.780
He then climbs down to the avionics section
and attaches the explosives to the side of

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:09.439
the platform, revealing Julia, who is sleeping.

00:06:09.439 --> 00:06:14.250
At this point, it is revealed that Carson
has been the mastermind behind all of this.

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:18.569
Carson and Stephanie have conspired to hijack
the aircraft for a $50 million ransom and

00:06:18.569 --> 00:06:22.699
frame Kyle due to her knowledge of the plane;
they abducted Julia to force Kyle to unlock

00:06:22.699 --> 00:06:27.599
the casket where he placed the explosives
and detonator.

00:06:27.599 --> 00:06:31.590
Carson tells the captain that Kyle is a hijacker
and threatens to blow up the aircraft unless

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:35.470
the airline transfers $50 million into a bank
account.

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:39.180
Carson then tells an unnerved Stephanie that
he intends to blow up the plane, killing the

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:43.370
unconscious Julia, and leave Kyle dead with
the detonator in her hand.

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:47.030
Kyle still couldn't believe everything that
has happened; she anxiously looks out of the

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:49.430
window as the plane is about to land.

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:53.220
Other passengers are confused because of the
emergency landing.

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:55.940
After landing, the passengers exit the aircraft.

00:06:55.940 --> 00:07:00.379
As the captain is leaving, Kyle confronts
the captain, who angrily declares that the

00:07:00.379 --> 00:07:02.270
ransom has been paid.

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:04.020
Kyle is confused by this.

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:07.050
Soon, she realizes that all this is Carson's
doing.

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:12.889
He uses the situation to twist the truth and
makes it look as if Kyle is a terrorist.

00:07:12.889 --> 00:07:16.800
Realizing this truth, Kyle decides to take
advantage of the role of hijacker, commanding

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:19.969
Carson to remain aboard and the crew to leave.

00:07:19.969 --> 00:07:24.159
Carson hesitates, but he realizes that if
he refuses, it would be seen that the charade

00:07:24.159 --> 00:07:25.159
would be his.

00:07:25.159 --> 00:07:30.370
As soon as the plane's door closes, Kyle knocks
Carson unconscious with a fire extinguisher,

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:34.009
handcuffs him to a rail, and takes the detonator
from his pocket.

00:07:34.009 --> 00:07:36.139
Stephanie comes out of hiding.

00:07:36.139 --> 00:07:37.259
Carson regains consciousness.

00:07:37.259 --> 00:07:41.539
He chases after Kyle; shooting until she locks
herself in the cockpit.

00:07:41.539 --> 00:07:45.749
She opens a hatch door to the plane's attic
and throws out a binder to fool him.

00:07:45.749 --> 00:07:48.060
Carson hears the upstairs thud and leaves.

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:51.039
Kyle exits and encounters a guilt-ridden Stephanie.

00:07:51.039 --> 00:07:55.469
She punches her, who panics and immediately
flees the plane.

00:07:55.469 --> 00:08:01.180
Kyle continues to look for her daughter to
the avionics, and she finds Julia there, unconscious.

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:03.710
She immediately hugs her and carries her.

00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:07.900
Carson soon follows, and while searching,
reveals that he murdered her husband to smuggle

00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:12.669
the explosives inside his casket, knowing
that it would not be scanned at the checkpoint.

00:08:12.669 --> 00:08:17.340
Kyle immediately carries Julia into the aircraft's
non-combustible hold, with the detonator in hand

00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:20.900
Carson shoots at her as she closes the door.

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:25.599
With the non-combustible walls of the hold
to protect them, she detonates the explosives;

00:08:25.599 --> 00:08:27.960
exploding the plane, killing Carson.

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:30.930
The passengers and crew watch the explosion
in shock.

00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:34.120
A moment later, Kyle appears with her daughter.

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:38.120
As Kyle carries her daughter out onto the
tarmac, all the passengers are shocked upon

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:41.620
realizing that she had been telling the truth
the whole time.

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:46.000
The next morning, at the airport terminal,
Captain Rich approaches and apologizes to

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.029
Kyle for his skepticism.

00:08:48.029 --> 00:08:52.660
Stephanie is led away by the FBI in handcuffs,
wherein an agent informs them that the Berlin

00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:55.280
mortuary director has also been arrested.

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:59.360
Kyle carries Julia through the crowd of passengers
who realize the truth.

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:02.490
All are stunned and somewhat guilt-ridden
for not believing her.

00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:06.570
Before loading her daughter into a van to
take them away, Julia wakes up and sleepily

00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:10.110
asks, "Are we there yet?" ,as they get ready
to leave.

00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:14.370
The final scene shows the Egyptian passenger
helping to pick up her bag as an act of respect

00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:15.889
and forgiveness.

00:09:15.889 --> 00:09:18.430
That's the ending of the movie "FLIGHT PLAN'.
