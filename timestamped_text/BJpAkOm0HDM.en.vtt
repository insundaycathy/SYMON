00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.320
Welcome back to Mrs Rundown, in todayâ€™s
video I am going to be recapping the events

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:09.450
of Harold &amp; Kumar Go to White Castle, a 2004
Comedy/Stoner film.

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:10.800
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.240
You have been warned.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.320
Now like the video and subscribe to the channel

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.960
The movie starts late on a Friday afternoon
at the investment bank where Harold works.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.460
Two of Harold's co-workers talk about going
out for the night to get laid.

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.800
One, who is heartbroken from a breakup, says
he can't go out because he has to work on

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.780
a project due the next day.

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:34.850
The other suggests giving the work to Harold
because he is "a nerdy little Asian guy."

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.600
When Harold is coerced into doing the work
by threats of being reported to his boss for

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.239
slacking off, he has to call his roommate
Kumar.

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:46.020
Kumar is at a medical school application interview.

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.469
He doesn't want to become a doctor but is
applying to medical school so his father will

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.609
keep paying for his apartment.

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:55.100
Harold interrupts the interview with the phone
call to tell Kumar he can't party tonight

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.950
because he has to work.

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:00.600
Kumar replies--in front of the dean-- "Fuck
that shit, since when has doing your work

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.590
prevented you from getting high?"

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.860
This line of reasoning easily changes Harold's
mind, and the dean's as well.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.240
Though the dean had been on the verge of admitting
Kumar before he took Harold's call, he's appalled

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.930
by Kumar's bad manners and bad attitude.

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.229
The dean throws Kumar out of his office (but
not before Kumar spills a hot drink in his

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:20.820
lap).

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.390
Harold leaves his office where his bad day
gets worse when his briefcase strap breaks

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.320
and he is held up at the exit.

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.720
He drives home.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.580
As he's backing into a parking spot in front
of his apartment building, an Orange Ford

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.610
Bronco steals the space.

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.560
The group of "extreme assholes" in the Bronco
tell Harold, "this is America, dude, learn

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.920
how to drive" and flick him off.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.090
Harold finds another spot, many blocks away,
and walks through the front door of his building

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.680
to see his dream girl, Maria, waiting for
the elevator.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.580
He plays in his head how he wants the next
events to go: he tells Maria that she can

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:57.010
come over his place if she isn't doing anything
else that night, and she agrees.

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.220
Reality sets in and he walks into the elevator
with Maria and forgets to press his floor

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.640
number, which makes him look like an ass.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.270
He is about to say something to Maria but
chickens out and ends up jerking his mail

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:08.580
in his hand.

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.370
The elevator gets to his and Maria's floor
and they go their separate ways.

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.700
Maria tells him bye, to which he replies in
a low voice.

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.460
Harold gets into his apartment and the party
begins!

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:22.850
But first he has to chase Kumar out of his
room and dispose of his nail scissors, which

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.250
Kumar has been using to trim his pubes.

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.460
Then they settle down and get high.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.610
Joint after joint after bong hit Harold and
Kumar get blitzed out of their skulls.

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.160
They see a TV news flash saying that a cheetah
has escaped from the Morestown Zoo.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.700
Now they got the munchies.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.850
They talk about getting some KFC when a White
Castle advertisement comes on the TV and they

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.620
are focused on White Castle and nothing else.

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.240
They ask their neighbours Goldstein and Rosenberg
to go along, but Goldstein and Rosenberg would

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.990
rather have hot dogs.

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:55.320
On the way to Harold's car, they see the yahoos
who took Harold's parking spot; the yahoos

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.720
call Harold and Kumar fags.

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.710
They go to where they think White Castle is,
but it's not a White Castle anymore; it's

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:03.100
a Burger Shack.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.230
They ask the drive-thru worker what happened
to the White Castle.

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:10.020
He informs them that Burger Shack bought that
location 4 years earlier.

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:15.410
He also tells them about a White Castle 45
minutes away that is open 24 hours.

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.100
They head for the restaurant and are about
to smoke some more but Harold being the paranoid

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:23.090
smoker he is throws the weed out the window
because Kumar gets stuck in a toll booth that

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:24.550
isn't working.

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.670
Kumar gets mad at Harold and decides to take
him to Princeton to sweet talk Cindy Kim,

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.370
who has a huge crush on Harold, into getting
them some weed.

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.980
Harold goes to a meeting of Cindy's club while
Kumar goes around the college looking for

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.640
anyone who has weed.

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.690
He finds a huge stoner named Bradley (who
shows him a pound of weed.

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.550
Kumar catches the fancy of two cute girls
in argyle sweaters, who invite him to come

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:47.390
up to their room later.

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.660
Bradley sells a very over-priced quarter of
weed to Kumar.

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.410
Kumar finds Harold and they smoke a joint
on a staircase, which catches the attention

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.440
of a Princeton security guard.

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.050
The guard chases them.

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:02.260
They escape by hiding in the women's bathroom,
where they unwillingly overhear and over smell

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.010
the argyle sweater girls playing a disgusting
game called "battleshits."

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.980
The security guards catch Bradley with his
pound of weed and take him to jail.

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.540
Back on the road to White Castle, Kumar stops
in the middle of nowhere to take a piss.

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:15.540
He goes into the woods and finds a random
bush and starts peeing when a man (Jamie Kennedy)

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:16.540
dressed in a suit comes out of nowhere and
starts peeing next to him.

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:17.540
When Kumar asks him what he is doing, the
man starts flipping out asking him if it's

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:18.540
his special bush and if he is "a fucking tree
hugger."

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:20.290
Meanwhile, a raccoon jumps into their car;
Harold, who's working on his laptop, doesn't

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:21.370
notice.

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.070
When Kumar is done urinating he gets back
into the car and drives off.

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:29.580
The raccoon jumps into the front seat and
bites Harold's neck, making him think he has

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:30.580
rabies.

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.850
He throws the raccoon out the window.

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:36.890
They go to the hospital where they find out
that Harold doesn't have rabies, but Kumar's

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:40.100
father, a doctor, catches them before they
can leave.

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.830
He questions Kumar about the failed medical
school interview and tells Kumar that he has

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:48.000
one more interview tomorrow and if Kumar is
anything less than perfect he will completely

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.510
cut him off.

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:53.520
Kumar then steals his father's ID card in
hopes that it will get them access to the

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.970
hospital's supply of medical marijuana.

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:59.820
Kumar and Harold are then mistaken for Kumar's
dad and brother and they're asked to perform

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.950
emergency surgery on a man who has been shot.

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:06.810
Kumar performs it flawlessly and asks the
man if he knows how to get to White Castle;

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:11.190
he gives them directions and off they go.

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:14.230
Harold and Kumar see Maria leaving a movie
theatre.

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:18.210
Kumar yells to Maria, but Harold doesn't want
her to see him so he leans down and presses

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:19.770
the gas pedal.

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:22.710
Kumar loses control and the car goes down
a steep hill.

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:24.890
The car is undamaged but the tire pops.

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:27.470
Then a tow truck picks them up.

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:31.480
It's driven by an ugly man covered with boils
and sores, Freakshow.

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:34.990
He takes them to his house where he tells
them that he will fix their car and they can

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:37.330
go inside and fuck his wife Liane.

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:39.500
To their surprise his wife is HOT!!

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:43.330
She is a freak and she wants them to fuck
her at the same time, but Harold says he doesn't

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:46.810
want his balls touching Kumar's so they ask
for blow jobs.

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:50.650
Before they get very far, Freakshow comes
in and flips out to see his wife topless and

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:52.840
the guys about to touch her breasts.

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:56.400
Then he lightens up and asks if they want
to have a foursome, which scares Harold and

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.810
Kumar and they run out.

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:04.020
They flee in the car, but they're lost, so
Kumar picks up a hitchhiker, hoping that the

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:06.400
guy will know how to get to the White Castle.

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:09.940
The hitchhiker Neil is tripping off X and
wants to pick up some strippers so he can

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:11.160
get laid.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:12.639
He's no help to them.

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:15.750
They find a convenience store where they hope
to get directions.

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:19.250
They meet back up with the "extreme assholes,"
who give them more shit.

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:22.690
They get directions from a man working at
the store as the "extreme assholes" tear it

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:23.770
apart.

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:28.080
While they are walking back to the car, Neil
takes off with it.

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:32.010
On the way to call the police about the stolen
car, Harold is arrested for getting into an

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:35.730
altercation with a police officer while trying
to cross the street.

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:40.700
While in jail Harold sees Bradley the huge
stoner, stripped down to his BVDs.

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:44.390
Bradley's pound of weed has been confiscated
and his mother takes him home.

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:47.010
Kumar breaks into the jail and lets Harold
out.

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:51.510
Kumar catches a whiff of weed, sees Bradley's
confiscated pound, and takes it.

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:54.020
He and Harold are now running from the police.

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:59.120
They end up in the woods where they see the
cheetah that escaped from the zoo.

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:02.900
To make sure the cheetah doesn't kill them
they toke up and get the cheetah blazed.

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:06.710
They end up riding the cheetah in hopes that
it will take them to White Castle, but Harold

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:08.670
gets knocked off and knocked out.

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:09.670
He has a psychedelic interlude--featuring
walking hamburgers, a white castle, and lots

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:10.670
of marijuana leaves--in which he shoots the
obnoxious cop who arrested him ("Bullets--my

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:11.670
only weakness!

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:12.670
How did you know?") and hooks up with Maria.

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:13.670
He wakes to find that it's Kumar, not Maria,
licking his face; that his laptop has been

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:14.670
smashed; and that the cheetah took them in
the wrong direction.

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:18.120
Now Harold, who has never been as devoted
to the quest as Kumar, decides to give up

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:20.180
and go home, hamburger less.

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:24.150
But just then they catch sight of their neighbors
Goldstein and Rosenberg scarfing down hot

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:26.180
dogs and looking happy.

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:29.370
Harold decides that he craves that feeling
of satisfaction that comes from getting what

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:30.380
you want--in his case, White Castle burgers.

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:34.430
They go back to the convenience store, where
they steal the "extreme" guys' Bronco.

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:37.500
As they speed down the road a cop starts to
chase them.

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:41.910
They turn into the woods to lose the cop and
come to an abrupt stop at the edge of a cliff--where,

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:44.530
looking down, they see WHITE CASTLE!!

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:47.660
Kumar makes a passionate speech about their
whole journey and how it's not just about

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:51.720
hamburgers any more: it's about being in America
and to have any dream you want to have and

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:53.860
their dream is to get to White Castle.

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:57.360
Riding a hang glider they find on the roof
of the Bronco, they jump off the mountain

00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:59.250
just as the sun comes up.

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:02.600
They crash into a tree and land right in front
of White castle.

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:07.380
They go in and each order 30 hamburgers, 4
orders of fries and 4 sodas--only to find

00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:09.310
out that they don't have any money.

00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:12.710
But Neil Patrick Harris sees them and gives
Harold back his car key, says he is going

00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:16.750
to pay for their meals and gives Harold $200
for the "love stains" he made in the back

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:18.020
of his car.

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:20.730
They enjoy a huge, fabulous meal.

00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:24.530
Once they finish, they decide that they are
going to change their lives.

00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:27.560
Kumar will go to med school and to his interview
that day.

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:31.450
When Harold's slacker co-workers walk in,
he stands up for himself and tells them he

00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:34.000
isn't going to do their work for them anymore.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.120
He and Kumar leave White Castle full and changed.

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:41.440
Harold tells Kumar he is going to ask Maria
out and stop being a pussy.

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:45.920
At home, they're getting off the elevator
when Maria gets on.

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:48.230
Kumar makes Harold go back down with her.

00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:52.190
After an awkward start, Harold spills his
guts and Maria ends up making out with him

00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:53.560
and falls for him.

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:55.190
She tells him "now you have to work on your
timing;" she is going to Amsterdam and she

00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:57.230
will be back in 10 days.

00:08:57.230 --> 00:09:02.250
Harold rides the elevator back up where Kumar
meets him and asks if Maria touched his penis.

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:05.570
