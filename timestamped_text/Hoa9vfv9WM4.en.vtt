﻿Hi guys, Scifi Recapped here. Before we&nbsp;
start, WARNING! Spoilers Ahead! Today,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.640
I`m gonna explain a 2019 science fiction&nbsp;
and thriller movie called Butt Boy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.400
This movie has a very unique&nbsp;
concept and storyline.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.680
Make sure to watch it till the end to find out!
The story begins with Chip Gutchel, an IT staff&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.080
in a small corporate company, who seems unhappy&nbsp;
with his current job and unhappy with his life.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.160
While having dinner with his family, Chip&nbsp;
tells his wife that he is going to get his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.600
very first prostate exam tomorrow. It seems like&nbsp;
their current relationship is not that good.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.120
His wife then continues talking to her&nbsp;
friend on the phone leaving and ignoring&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.720
Chip alone with their baby. Moving on to the&nbsp;
next day, Chip meets his doctor. Surprisingly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.880
he begins to feel and discover a new kind of&nbsp;
sensation while the doctor is examining him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.400
Since then, Chip`s weird habit to stick things up&nbsp;
his butt, which he finds unexpectedly pleasurable,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:57.680
begins. The first thing to disappear is a bar&nbsp;
of soap, which he finds while having a bath.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.800
The next day, even a TV remote control&nbsp;
becomes a victim of Chip`s bizarre behavior.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.200
His wife tries to find the missing remote control,&nbsp;
but Chip pretends like he doesn't know anything.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.160
Worse thing happens when he is left alone in&nbsp;
the house, where the poor Rocky, his own dog,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:17.040
becomes the next victim and disappears. Chip&nbsp;
and his wife go to the local park to find the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.360
missing Rocky, but as soon as he sees a woman&nbsp;
carrying her baby while sitting in the park,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.240
suddenly Chip asks his wife to go&nbsp;
home and let him do the finding.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.760
Can you guys guess what he is going to do? From&nbsp;
Chip’s facial expression, we can see that he is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:34.000
thinking about shoving humans up to his butt,&nbsp;
and later on, he carries out his thinking.
&nbsp;

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.520
A few moments later, several cops come to Chip`s&nbsp;
house and question him regarding the missing child&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.240
at the park. Chip plays dumb and tells the cops&nbsp;
that he didn`t see anything strange at the park.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.200
Chip even helps the local community to find&nbsp;
the missing child, before self-disgust almost&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.320
overwhelms him. At some point, He also attempts&nbsp;
to commit suicide, but the rope cuts off.  
&nbsp;

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:00.240
The scene jumps forward nine years, when a local&nbsp;
detective named Russel Fox attends an Alcoholics&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:06.320
Anonymous or AA group. This group is a recovery&nbsp;
support for alcoholic people. There, they gather&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.280
and share about their problems. As a newcomer, he&nbsp;
is linked up with a sponsor who turns out to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.240
Chip himself. Chip and Russel then go for dinner,&nbsp;
where Russel shares that he is not married and has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:21.040
no kids. On the other hand, Chip also admits&nbsp;
that his marriage is not in a good condition.
&nbsp;

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.080
Even after several years have passed, Chip&nbsp;
seems still cannot escape from his bad habit.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.360
While playing monopoly with his family, he is&nbsp;
triggered by a blue plastic cone and can't get it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.880
out of his mind. At night, after some hesitation,&nbsp;
Chip finally takes that piece and puts it into his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.920
butt. On the other side, we discover that&nbsp;
Russel became an alcoholic for a reason.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.000
He stalks a girl with her husband who&nbsp;
seems to be his ex-wife. He even tries&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.320
to call the girl but receives no answer.
Chip`s addiction is now out of control as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:55.200
he keeps inserting random stuff, even a BIG ONE,&nbsp;
into his butt and he seems to enjoy it very much.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.600
He inserts almost everything that is available&nbsp;
in his house without having his wife know what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.880
he has been doing. At work, Chip`s boss wants to&nbsp;
conduct a Take Your Child To Work Day, where all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.680
the employees of the company bring their kids to&nbsp;
work and play together with them. The day comes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.640
and Chip`s boss asks all the children to play hide&nbsp;
and seek, but Chip just keeps working as usual. 
&nbsp;

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.400
After doing so well in his previous missions,&nbsp;
Russel is assigned to investigate a missing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:26.000
kid in the business district an hour ago. Guess&nbsp;
what? Yeah, it's in the company where Chip works.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.880
Russel arrives at the office and learns that&nbsp;
every camera in that office has been wiped.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.240
He starts interviewing the employees&nbsp;
one-by-one until the last one,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:39.280
which turns out to be Chip. Russel suspects&nbsp;
Chip to be the culprit as he is the only IT&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.120
guy who has the capability to edit and&nbsp;
remove any surveillance camera`s datas.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.560
Later, we discover that it was really Chip who&nbsp;
“kidnapped” the child by using his superpower butt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.360
and kept the CCTV recording, but he refuses to&nbsp;
answer Russel and walks away from the interview.
&nbsp;

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.640
Russel then becomes more suspicious towards Chip&nbsp;
as he finds a clue while inspecting his table.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:04.000
After work, Chip`s wife discovers that her husband&nbsp;
has been joining an AA group all this time,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.200
claiming that Chip has been lying all the time.&nbsp;
Feeling stressed, Chip decides to go out at night,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.920
but it turns out that he goes to adopt a new&nbsp;
pet. At the same time, Russel is tailing Chip&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:19.200
to find out about his suspicion. He hides&nbsp;
inside his car, so that Chip won’t spot him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.360
Because of this, he lost sight of Chip.&nbsp;
He then roams around to find Chip,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:28.000
and eventually he finds the cage where Chip keeps&nbsp;
the adopted pet, but strangely, there’s nothing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.360
there. There, he also finds something similar&nbsp;
to the clue he finds in Chip’s office desk.
&nbsp;

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:38.320
The next day, Russel explains to his superior&nbsp;
that Chip is the “kidnapper” by cramming objects,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.960
especially the missing child, up his butt. But&nbsp;
his boss doesn't buy the theory, leaving the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:48.000
detective with no choice but to go rogue. 
After being absent for a week, Chip finally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.120
comes back to the AA`s sharing session. After the&nbsp;
sharing session, Chip invites Russel to come over&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:57.760
to have dinner at his house. The detective tells&nbsp;
Chip`s wife that he is pretty close to finding the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:02.960
“kidnapper”, which makes Chip panic. He tries to&nbsp;
change the topic by asking Russel whether he has a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:08.320
girlfriend or not. Before the detective leaves,&nbsp;
he suddenly asks Chip to borrow the bathroom.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:13.440
Chip seems panicked because he kept the CCTV&nbsp;
recording in the bathroom. Out of nowhere,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:19.040
he starts banging the door, forcing Russel to get&nbsp;
out immediately. But fortunately, Russel manages&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:24.560
to discover the disk before the door is broken. 
While driving home, Russel realizes that he has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:30.240
been tailed by Chip. He stops and both of them&nbsp;
start fighting. Eventually, The detective wins the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:35.440
fight, but suddenly Chip puts down his pants and&nbsp;
starts producing a huge air vortex from his butt,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:40.400
pulling Russel`s car. But somehow, Russel&nbsp;
manages to start the car and drives away.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:45.040
He immediately goes to his former boss’&nbsp;
office to prove his statements before,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:50.480
but sadly, his boss tells him to get lost. 
At some point, Russel is finally brave enough&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:54.880
to visit the girl that was shown in the previous&nbsp;
scene, proving that she is indeed his ex-wife that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:59.920
is currently married to a new guy. Later,&nbsp;
he sneaks into his former office. There,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:03.860
we also discover that the missing baby at the&nbsp;
very first scene of the movie is Russel`s.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.680
That is why he seems to be so desperate&nbsp;
and hopeless throughout the movie.
&nbsp;

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:13.840
Long story short, to celebrate Chip`s son`s&nbsp;
birthday, Chip invites his family and friends&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:19.680
to play “laser battlefield”. Unexpectedly, Russel&nbsp;
also joins the “battlefield”, but with a real gun,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:24.560
aiming his AA sponsor who turns out to be his&nbsp;
baby`s “kidnapper”. He manages to shoot Chip&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:29.920
in the leg. Feeling cornered, Chip unleashes his&nbsp;
ultimate weapon which is the same huge air vortex&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:35.200
from his butt, causing Russel to pass out. Russel&nbsp;
wakes up in a very strange and smelly environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:40.800
There, he meets Andrew, the missing child who was&nbsp;
kidnapped at Chip`s office. He states that they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:46.800
are currently at Chip`s digestive system, to be&nbsp;
exact, rectum. Suddenly, a huge amount of gas is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:52.320
released and it turns out that it is a fart. After&nbsp;
that, Russel and Andrew continue exploring Chip`s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:57.760
digestive system. They manage to find Rocky,&nbsp;
the missing dog, and Russel`s missing baby who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:02.160
has grown into a young boy. They also discover&nbsp;
all the stuff that Chip shoved up his butt.
&nbsp;

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:07.840
One month later after getting shot, Chip`s butt is&nbsp;
being examined by a doctor before being released&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:13.200
to ensure no internal bleeding occurs. Because of&nbsp;
that, Russel manages to find a way out and starts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:18.560
planning a strategy. Chip also gets appreciated&nbsp;
by his AA`s mates and even gets a promotion at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:22.400
his office, because of Chip’s bravery to&nbsp;
escape from a “life or death situation”.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:28.160
Later, Russel`s strategy seems to be working&nbsp;
as Chip starts to discharge the soap, TV remote&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:33.280
control, and even HIS DOG from his butt. To cure&nbsp;
his “stomachache”, Chip drinks a bottle of stomach&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:38.640
elixir, but this liquid drops into Andrew`s&nbsp;
face, leaves burn marks, and a few moments later,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:44.800
he dies. The next day, Chip is invited by Mayor&nbsp;
Cage to celebrate his braveness. While giving&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:49.280
his speech at the podium, he feels something is&nbsp;
wrong with his stomach. Turns out that Russel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:53.600
has been pouring liquid that triggers Chip`s&nbsp;
digestive system to produce a huge amount of gas.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:59.680
After that, he lights up his lighter, causing Chip&nbsp;
to explode and die immediately. In the middle of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:04.720
chaos, Russel and his son manage to survive&nbsp;
and Russel hands over the CCTV recording to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:09.840
his shocked boss. At the end of the movie, Russel&nbsp;
brings his long-awaited son to the hospital where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:15.120
the kid finally manages to meet his mom again.
