00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.510
Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:05.390
Today, I'm going to explain a horror sci-fi
film called "Body Snatchers."

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:06.760
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:08.380
Watch out and take care.

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:11.780
Marti Malone has been looking forward to her
summer vacation.

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.820
But she has no choice but to spend most of
it on the road because her father, Steve,

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.490
has been assigned by the Environmental Protection
Agency to investigate possible contamination

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:21.550
in a military base in Alabama.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.380
Joining them on the trip is her stepmother,
Carol, and her 6-year-old half-brother Andy.

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.779
Carol and Andy are enjoying the road trip,
but Marti feels left out as nobody asked her

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:31.660
what she wanted to do for her vacation.

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:36.450
During a stop at a gas station, Marti is suddenly
attacked by a soldier inside the bathroom.

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.280
The man holds a knife against her throat and
covers her mouth to prevent her from screaming.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.620
When he notices that she's afraid, he slowly
removes his hand from her mouth and warns

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.480
her that "They" are out there, and they get
people when they're asleep.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.960
When he releases Marti, she runs to her dad
and tells him that someone with a knife attacked

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.321
her in the toilet.

00:00:51.321 --> 00:00:54.129
But when Steve enters the bathroom, there's
nobody there.

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:58.100
When they arrive at the base, they are assigned
to a house in sector C. As Marti looks around

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.959
the house, she finds out that there are only
two bedrooms.

00:01:00.959 --> 00:01:03.549
Carol tells her that she'll have to share
a room with Andy.

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:06.799
Instead of helping her father unpack, Marti
wanders around the base and comes across a

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:08.440
restricted area.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.020
Several military personnel approach her, telling
her that she can't stay there without a security

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.130
clearance.

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.590
Before long, a girl in a red convertible arrives
and tells Marti to get inside the car.

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.039
The girl introduces herself as Jenn and tells
her that her father runs the base.

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:25.340
Jenn takes Marti to her home and tries to
introduce Marti to her mother, but she's passed

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:26.730
out on a sofa.

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.830
Jenn discloses that her mother is an alcoholic
as she takes a sip of her mother's vodka.

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.590
That night, Andy wakes up from a nightmare,
so she goes to his parent's bedroom.

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.380
As Carol tries to put the boy at ease, they
hear a man screaming outside while some military

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.200
personnel loads him in a truck.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.420
The next day, Steve meets up with General
Platt so he could start his investigation.

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.520
Platt, who's not enthusiastic about Steve's
presence at the base, tells a captain to assist

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.530
Steve in any way so he could leave as soon
as possible.

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.920
While gathering samples at the river, Major
Collins, head of the base medical corps, approaches

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.420
Steve and asks him about the possible effects
of exposure to chemicals.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.200
Steve informs him that most of the chemicals
stored at the base are toxic.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.319
Collins asks him if there are psychological
effects from chemical exposure because he

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:08.640
has witnessed a few soldiers exhibiting psychosis
and paranoia.

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.090
Some of them are afraid to sleep, while others
are afraid of their own family.

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.420
Steve tells him that he has no idea what Collins
has seen, but he assures him that it's not

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.210
related to the chemicals.

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:20.239
Before leaving Steve to his work, Collins
asks him to keep him up-to-date about his

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:21.739
investigation.

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:25.500
Back at the house, several soldiers arrive
to deliver some equipment for Steve.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.739
Marti lets them in, but she's puzzled when
she finds the soldiers inside her father's

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:29.739
room.

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:33.840
When she asks them what they're doing, they
claim that they're just delivering the boxes.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.230
Meanwhile, Andy is brought to a daycare center,
where children are taught to draw.

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.129
When the teacher tells the kids to hold their
pictures up, they all have drawn the same

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:41.800
artwork except Andy.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.799
When Andy sees the other drawings, he gets
confused and starts to wonder if he's done

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:46.159
something wrong.

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:50.500
Later on, he leaves the daycare center and
runs around the military base on his own.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.360
When a serviceman named Tim asks what he's
doing around the base, Andy tells him that

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.269
he's running away from bad people.

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:00.170
When Tim takes the boy home, Marti points
out that he's still supposed to be in daycare.

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.180
Andy tells her that he hates the place because
they all had the same pictures and tried to

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.620
make him go to sleep.

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.629
When Steve arrives, Marti starts flirting
with Tim and learns that he's a chopper pilot.

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:11.569
Before heading back to the barracks, Tim lets
her know that he usually hangs out at a bar

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:13.299
called Top Gun.

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:16.519
Later that night, Carol is perplexed that
Andy is already having trouble fitting in

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:19.010
at the daycare when he's only been there for
a day.

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.620
Steve tells Carol that they should take him
back there soon so he could make new friends.

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.519
While Marti washes the dishes, Jenn knocks
on the door and tells Marti to come with her.

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:29.560
Before they could leave, Carol sees Jenn and
invites her in.

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.510
When Jenn introduces herself to Steve, he
learns that she's the general's daughter.

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.470
Jenn tells Steve that she stopped by so she
could take Marti out and show her around.

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.790
Steve agrees to let Marti go, but he tells
her to be home by midnight.

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.769
Jenn takes Marti to a bar, where they come
across Tim and a serviceman named Pete.

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:48.469
Jenn notices that the place looks empty, so
she asks Pete where the others are.

00:03:48.469 --> 00:03:51.990
Pete quips that they avoided the place because
they heard Jenn's dad is coming.

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:54.709
When Jenn leaves with Pete, Tim offers Marti
a beer.

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:58.129
As they get acquainted, two military personnel
enter the room and grab a soldier sleeping

00:03:58.129 --> 00:03:59.689
at the other end of the bar.

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:03.189
As one of the officers turns to them, Marti
is struck with fear when she recognizes him

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:05.150
as the man who attacked her at the gas station.

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.810
When they confront him about the incident,
the officer tells them that he doesn't know

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:09.290
what they're talking about.

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.640
The officer advises Tim to take Marti home,
asserting that she might have too much to

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:13.640
drink.

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.260
When the officer leaves, Tim tries to follow
him, but Marti stops him, saying she might've

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:18.900
made a mistake.

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.120
Somewhere near the camp, soldiers are picking
up huge pods from a swamp to load them into

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.120
a truck.

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.640
Meanwhile, Andy gets up from his bed and looks
for Carol in their room, but when he gets

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.760
closer, her body decomposes.

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.670
As he screams in horror, he sees Carol entering
the room, but Andy senses that she's not his

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:33.670
mother.

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:36.280
He runs to his dad, telling him that his mother
died.

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.830
Carol follows him downstairs and tells Steve
that Andy had a bad dream.

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.380
When Carol tries to put him to bed, Andy runs
out of the house, insisting that she's not

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:44.450
his mother.

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:48.010
As Steve runs after the boy, Marti arrives
with Tim and her friends.

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:51.230
Steve tells Marti to take Andy back inside
the house and confronts Tim.

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:53.950
He informs Tim that Marti shouldn't be drinking
because she's underage.

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:58.210
Tim apologizes, but Steve tells him not to
show up at the house anymore.

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:01.430
As Marti tries to put Andy to sleep, he tells
her that the woman that looks like Carol is

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:02.700
not his mother.

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:06.000
Marti thinks that the boy had a nightmare,
so she tells him that she had terrible dreams

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.830
too when she was his age.

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.141
Steve confronts Marti for getting home late
and intoxicated, but Marti argues that she

00:05:11.141 --> 00:05:12.730
only had one beer.

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:15.810
When Steve refuses to believe her, Marti tells
him that she shouldn't bother talking with

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:18.020
him because he never listens to her.

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.460
In the morning, Marti tells Steve that she
can't wait till she turns 18, so she could

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:22.810
leave the house.

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:26.380
Steve tells her that if she wants to leave,
she doesn't have to wait till she's 18.

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:29.740
When Marti goes out, Steve asks Andy whether
he wants to go to daycare or stay with his

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:30.740
mother.

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:33.680
Andy, however, reiterates that his mother
is dead.

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:37.690
When Steve looks at Carol to see how she'd
react, she just stares at him and forces a

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:38.690
smile.

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:42.120
Inside a warehouse at the base, Steve is testing
some toxic chemicals when somebody accidentally

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.300
drops two barrels from the forklift.

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:47.650
One of the crew members gets burned, so Steve
tells them to call an ambulance.

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:51.270
However, another crew member tells Steve not
to worry, saying they can take care of the

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:52.600
injured man.

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:56.080
Steve is horrified to see the injury, but
the crew seems oddly calm.

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.410
When Marti visits Jenn at home, Jenn tells
hints that something might be wrong with her

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:00.410
mother.

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:03.460
She points out that her mother's glass is
usually filled with vodka, but at the time,

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:04.890
there's nothing but water.

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:07.740
Jenn's mother leaves the house, telling them
that she will play bridge at their neighbor's

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:11.010
house, but Jenn stresses that her mother doesn't
know how to play bridge.

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:14.510
Meanwhile, Steve goes back to the warehouse
to take a tissue sample from the suit burned

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:15.510
in the accident.

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:18.780
When he tests the sample, he can't identify
the substance because it doesn't show up on

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:20.340
the list of herbicides.

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:23.270
He calls his office and tells them that he
will send the sample the next day.

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:26.180
That evening, Andy tells Marti that he wants
to go home.

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:30.160
Marti assures him that their father will take
them home as soon as he finishes the investigation.

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:33.870
When Marti tells him that everything will
be fine, Andy suddenly blurts out that "it

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:34.870
happens" when they sleep.

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:37.630
When Marti asks what he means, Andy tells
her, "you die."

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:41.020
Carol then enters their room to tell Marti
that the bathtub is ready.

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:44.260
When Marti goes to the bathroom, Carol urges
Andy to get in bed.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:48.330
The child hesitates, fearing that he'll die
when he sleeps, but he eventually agrees.

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:51.720
As Marti falls asleep in the bathtub, tentacles
start creeping out of a pod hidden in the

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:52.720
ceiling.

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:56.850
Carol notices that Steve's arching his back
in the bedroom, so she offers him a massage.

00:06:56.850 --> 00:06:59.730
Soon, the tentacles reach Marti and creep
into her nose.

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:04.080
In the bedroom, tentacles have also started
entering Steve's body as Carol watches.

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:07.520
As the pod above the ceiling turns into a
human, Marti suddenly wakes up and swiftly

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:09.530
removes the tentacles from her face.

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:12.810
As she gasps for air, the body falls on top
of her.

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:16.370
Horrified from seeing a copy of herself, she
gets up from the bathtub and runs to her father's

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:17.370
bedroom.

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:20.550
When she finds him in bed, she removes the
tentacles and wakes him up.

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:24.080
A hand suddenly grabs her ankle from beneath
the bed, so she pulls away, dragging Steve's

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:25.850
duplicate out in the open.

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:29.070
Not long, the body starts to wither and gets
pulled back under the bed.

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:33.660
Meanwhile, Carol calmly calls someone on the
phone, asking duplicates to go to their house.

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:36.520
When Steve finds Carol, he tells her that
they need to leave.

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:40.150
Carol, however, stresses that there's nowhere
to go because what they just experienced is

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:41.620
happening everywhere.

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:45.080
She warns them that they can't run or hide
because there's no one like them left.

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:48.440
Steve finally realizes that Carol is not the
same person he once knew.

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:51.670
Carol tells him not to be afraid because all
the fear and confusion will soon disappear

00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:52.950
when he sleeps.

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:56.220
As she walks toward Steve, she convinces him
to join them, saying they will be connected

00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:58.690
and he'll feel fantastic when he wakes up.

00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:01.970
When Marti and Andy reach the front door,
Steve shoves Carol away and runs out of the

00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:02.970
house.

00:08:02.970 --> 00:08:07.020
Carol walks outside the door and emits an
ear-piercing wail, calling other duplicates.

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:10.000
People rush outside of their homes to run
after Steve and Marti.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.050
When they get to a corner of the sector, three
men start shooting at the people chasing them.

00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:17.800
Tim is startled by the gunshots and the wailing
outside, so he asks Petey if he knows what's

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:18.800
happening.

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:22.550
As he searches around the house, he comes
across Petey and other M.P.'s in the bathroom.

00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:24.510
Petey tells him to go to sleep.

00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:28.610
When he refuses, they try to subdue him, but
he fights back and manages to escape.

00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:32.219
Meanwhile, Steve takes Marti and Andy to a
warehouse and tells them to wait for him while

00:08:32.219 --> 00:08:33.289
he calls for help.

00:08:33.289 --> 00:08:36.939
As the duplicates continue to search for them,
Steve sneaks into a building and finds himself

00:08:36.939 --> 00:08:38.169
in an office.

00:08:38.169 --> 00:08:41.240
He tries using the phone, but he hears someone
else using it.

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:45.170
When he enters another room, he finds Major
Collins trying to connect to an outside line.

00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:48.550
However, the woman on the other end tells
Collins that all the lines are busy at the

00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:49.550
moment.

00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:52.470
Collins gets hysterical when the woman calls
him by his name even though he never mentioned

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:53.470
it.

00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:56.120
He throws the phone against the wall and takes
some amphetamines.

00:08:56.120 --> 00:09:00.220
When Steve approaches him, the major points
a gun at Steve, telling him to stay back.

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:03.800
Steve asks him if he has a car, but the major
argues that it's too late to run.

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:06.740
Collins tells him that they have to stand
up and fight because the duplicates will just

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:08.589
come after them if they run.

00:09:08.589 --> 00:09:12.079
Collins offers him some amphetamines, advising
him not to fall asleep.

00:09:12.079 --> 00:09:15.209
When Steve hears people arriving, he hides
in the next room.

00:09:15.209 --> 00:09:18.259
General Platt soon enters the room with a
few M.P.s. to convince Collins to allow them

00:09:18.259 --> 00:09:20.020
to replace him with a duplicate.

00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:22.939
The general reveals that there are already
thousands of them on earth, and they have

00:09:22.939 --> 00:09:25.529
grown stronger as they travel across the universe.

00:09:25.529 --> 00:09:29.360
The duplicates contend that the individual
is not essential because only unity can guarantee

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:30.360
survival.

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:33.399
They further stress that the human race is
doomed on its own, so he should join them

00:09:33.399 --> 00:09:35.250
if he wants to survive.

00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:38.709
As the general and the other duplicates approach
him, Collins shoots himself in the head rather

00:09:38.709 --> 00:09:40.990
than let them make a copy of his body.

00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:43.500
Steve gets back to the warehouse and tells
them that he found a way to get out of the

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:44.530
base.

00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:48.620
While driving a jeep out of the camp, Marti
notes that the duplicates are already everywhere.

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:51.541
When Marti asks where they're going, Steve
tells her not to worry because he knows what

00:09:51.541 --> 00:09:52.750
he's doing.

00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:55.269
Steve advises her not to show any emotions.

00:09:55.269 --> 00:09:59.480
Marti watches Steve intently as he drives,
suspecting that he has already been replaced.

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:02.790
When Steve reiterates that he knows what he's
doing, Marti pulls the hand brake and tries

00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:05.130
to take Andy out of the jeep so they could
run.

00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:07.139
Steve, however, manages to grab her.

00:10:07.139 --> 00:10:10.910
As she struggles, Tim arrives and tells Steve
to let Marti go.

00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:14.860
Marti runs toward Tim and asks him to shoot
Steve, saying he's not her father.

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:18.040
Steve calmly tells Tim to put the gun away,
but Marti points it at him while Tim is still

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:19.040
holding it.

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:22.670
Tim tries to take control of the weapon, but
Marti eventually manages to pull the trigger,

00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:24.569
hitting Steve in the chest.

00:10:24.569 --> 00:10:28.139
After Steve dies, they watch Steve's body
disintegrate rapidly, convincing Tim that

00:10:28.139 --> 00:10:29.350
he's a duplicate.

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:33.149
While they drive away, an M.P. wails to alert
the duplicates to their whereabouts.

00:10:33.149 --> 00:10:36.240
Tim drives to the hangar with the entire army
after them and tells Marti to stay at the

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:38.240
jeep while he takes out a helicopter.

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:40.399
He tells Marti to get ready to move when he
lands.

00:10:40.399 --> 00:10:43.890
Marti advises Tim to act like one of the duplicates
to avoid suspicion.

00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:46.860
When Tim reaches the chopper, Petey and his
friends arrive.

00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:51.540
Tim manages to avoid showing any emotion as
Petey observes his reactions to his questioning.

00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:54.760
As Petey continues to probe him, Tim tells
them that they're wasting time because someone

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:56.490
is waiting for light support.

00:10:56.490 --> 00:11:00.370
Before he gets inside the helicopter, Petey
tells Tim that he slept with his girlfriend.

00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:04.399
When Tim doesn't react, Petey tells the M.P.'s
to let him fly the chopper.

00:11:04.399 --> 00:11:07.040
Outside the hangar, the duplicates find Marti
and Andy.

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:09.949
Tim sees them being forced into a truck, so
he follows them.

00:11:09.949 --> 00:11:13.639
Soon, the truck arrives in the infirmary,
so Tim lands the helicopter and looks for

00:11:13.639 --> 00:11:14.749
them inside.

00:11:14.749 --> 00:11:18.389
Tim carefully walks around without an expression
on his face as he witnesses people being replaced

00:11:18.389 --> 00:11:19.649
in the room.

00:11:19.649 --> 00:11:23.339
After looking around the room, Tim finally
finds Marti as she is being replaced.

00:11:23.339 --> 00:11:26.129
While other duplicates are distracted, Tim
tries to wake Marti up.

00:11:26.129 --> 00:11:30.720
Marti's copy soon comes to life, so Tim slowly
removes the tentacles from her face.

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:34.470
When the duplicate begs him to stop, he swiftly
pulls out the tentacles, causing the duplicate

00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:35.860
to wince in pain.

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:38.880
When Marti wakes up, the duplicate starts
to wither away.

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:42.670
Outside, General Platt's duplicate is assigning
trucks to drive to different bases across

00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:43.670
the U.S.

00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:47.029
Meanwhile, Tim and Marti calmly walk out of
the infirmary, trying to blend in with the

00:11:47.029 --> 00:11:48.029
duplicates.

00:11:48.029 --> 00:11:51.550
Marti asks Tim if he's seen Andy, but he tells
her that he wasn't in the infirmary.

00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:55.459
As they walk towards the helicopter, Marti
tells him that she's not leaving without Andy.

00:11:55.459 --> 00:11:58.630
Tim tells her that they'll come back for the
boy, but she insists on finding him before

00:11:58.630 --> 00:11:59.879
leaving.

00:11:59.879 --> 00:12:03.620
As they walk around, they come across Jenn,
so they try to maintain their cover.

00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:06.730
When she asks them where they're going, Tim
tells her they have work to do.

00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:10.930
As they leave, Jenn whispers to Marti, saying
she saw Andy and he's looking for her.

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:14.809
Marti keeps walking, but she soon turns around
to ask Jenn where he saw the boy.

00:12:14.809 --> 00:12:17.550
Jenn starts wailing, so they run towards the
chopper.

00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:21.399
As Tim prepares to fly the helicopter, Andy
arrives and calls out to Marti.

00:12:21.399 --> 00:12:24.759
She takes him inside the chopper and hugs
him, but as they fly away, Andy shoves Marti

00:12:24.759 --> 00:12:26.120
and attacks Tim.

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:28.749
Marti tries to pull Andy away as he covers
Tim's eyes.

00:12:28.749 --> 00:12:31.889
Tim tells Marti to throw him out because he's
no longer her brother.

00:12:31.889 --> 00:12:35.070
After she pulls him away from Tim, the boy
starts strangling her.

00:12:35.070 --> 00:12:38.959
When Marti throws the boy off the chopper,
he wails as he falls to the ground.

00:12:38.959 --> 00:12:42.769
Back at the base, the captain asks the general
if they should go after the helicopter.

00:12:42.769 --> 00:12:45.820
General Platt tells him to let them go because
no one would believe them.

00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:49.529
The next day, Tim blows up the military trucks
that came out of the Alabama base.

00:12:49.529 --> 00:12:53.630
Marti confesses that she felt conflicting
emotions such as vengeance, despair, hatred,

00:12:53.630 --> 00:12:57.100
remorse, and pity at the same time as she
watches the bombs explode.

00:12:57.100 --> 00:13:00.610
When they arrive in Atlanta, they are given
clearance to land at an airbase.

00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:04.019
As Tim lands the chopper, Marti recalls her
stepmother’s words telling them there's

00:13:04.019 --> 00:13:11.430
nowhere for them to run because there's no
one like them left.
