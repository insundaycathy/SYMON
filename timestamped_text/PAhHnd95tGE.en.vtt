00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:01.859
Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.859 --> 00:00:07.700
Today, I'm going to explain an adventure and
sci-fi film called "2001: A Space Odyssey."

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.140
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:11.060
Watch out and take care.

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:15.180
In the dawn of man, only shrubs and giant
rock formations can be seen for miles over

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:16.299
the desert.

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:19.340
The gushes of winds and birds chirping start
the morning.

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:24.030
The sun fully rises, and there appears apes
hiding behind a shadow of a boulder.

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:27.500
Creatures resembling anteaters live harmoniously
with the apes.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.630
The silence is deafening, and only the hostile
grunts of the apes disrupt it.

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.270
Peace, serenity, and boredom radiate from
the environment.

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.489
The most exciting thing happening is two apes
picking off bugs from one another.

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:43.820
A feline ambushes an unsuspecting ape, jumping
onto it and latching its sharp teeth into

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.000
the flesh.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.650
The rest of the apes howl at the sight of
their comrade getting killed.

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.530
Near a water deposit, a group of apes is seen
cleaning themselves and drinking from the

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.760
muddy pond.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.940
A scream-off begins as a rival tribe confronts
them.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.190
Their hostility and anger are showing, but
no one makes any violent move.

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.750
A few strained throats later, the rival tribe
successfully drives the other apes off, leaving

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.000
the pond all to themselves.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.270
The day ends, and the land grows quieter than
before.

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.270
The apes are in their caves, waiting for the
sun to fall.

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.080
As they open their eyes, something disgruntles
them.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.700
They make their way out to see an unknown
structure.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.190
Their suspiciousness quickly turns into curiosity
as more and more apes try to touch and inspect

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:25.470
the strange structure.

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.410
However, nothing came of it.

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:31.689
A lone ape scavenges a pile of bones and grabs
a sturdy piece.

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:35.990
It starts to hammer down the rest of the bones,
discovering the power of tools.

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.360
The ape continues to furiously smash the bones
to pieces, practicing as if the bones are

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.840
a real creature.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.560
With this newfound knowledge, the ape hunts
an animal and eats it.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.810
The concept of using bones as weapons quickly
spread throughout the ape colony, allowing

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.799
for hunting to become a new source of food.

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:57.110
A new day comes, and it starts with an eventful
setting as two tribes of apes are once again

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:58.130
in a conflict.

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.060
However, this time, one colony has the upper
hand.

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.560
An unlucky ape tries to get near the ape with
a weapon without knowing that it will take

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.979
its last step and final cry.

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.230
This scares off the rest of the rival apes,
ensuring their spot at the top of the food

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:13.230
chain.

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.700
In outer space, a satellite surveys Earth.

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.859
A spacecraft appears, and the interior of
it resembles an airplane.

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:24.999
There sits a man named Floyd, a Doctor of
Astronautics, who’s sleeping while the movie

00:02:24.999 --> 00:02:27.079
he's watching continues to play.

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:31.420
A woman enters the cabin wearing an all-white
uniform with Grip Shoes, allowing her to stay

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.779
on her feet and not float all over the place
because of the zero gravity.

00:02:35.779 --> 00:02:39.870
The spacecraft arrives at the space station,
and Floyd walks into the main level.

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.269
He talks to the receptionist that knows who
he already is.

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:47.830
Floyd asks for Mr. Miller of Station Security
for their meeting.

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.989
Miller conveniently walks in and shakes the
hand of Floyd.

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:56.019
After a bit of small talk, Floyd proceeds
to use a Voice Print Identification machine.

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:00.489
There he states his personal information and
his destination, which is the moon.

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:04.739
The two catch up with one another, but Floyd
interrupts, saying he has to make a phone

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:05.739
call.

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:08.680
He slips a card into a machine and dials a
number.

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.319
His daughter appears on the screen.

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:13.700
She asks if Floyd can come to her birthday
tomorrow.

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.839
He apologetically says he can't.

00:03:15.839 --> 00:03:20.129
They say their goodbyes, and as the screen
turns off, the girl is seen with a huge smile

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:21.980
on her face.

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.799
Floyd then reconnects with a good friend named
Elena.

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:29.669
After an exchange of compliments, Elena introduces
Floyd to her colleagues.

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:32.819
He sits down and mingles with the group.

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:35.779
Floyd says that he’ll be going to a place
called Clavius.

00:03:35.779 --> 00:03:40.089
Out of curiosity, a man questions him about
the strange things happening there.

00:03:40.089 --> 00:03:44.239
However, Floyd portrays that he isn't aware
of anything, but it seems as though he just

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:46.670
isn't allowed to discuss details about it.

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:51.260
The man iterates that they haven't contacted
the station at Clavius for the past ten days.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.669
They discuss a few more strange events about
the place, like a rampant epidemic spreading,

00:03:55.669 --> 00:03:58.239
prompting Floyd to leave and go on his way.

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:01.089
While flying to the moon, Floyd takes a nap
in his seat.

00:04:01.089 --> 00:04:04.629
The flight stewardess distributes containers
of food that are dispensed through straws

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:06.510
to everyone on the ship.

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:11.159
Everything onboard displays countless interesting
innovations, magnifying the futuristic aspects

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:13.420
that are present at the time.

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.579
Finally, they land on the moon.

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:19.959
Distinguished people are all present in a
room waiting for a meeting to start.

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:25.280
Halverson introduces Floyd to the group; he
stands and makes his way to the podium.

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.430
In his speech, he addresses the masking of
what's genuinely happening in Clavius.

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:34.100
A cover-up story of an epidemic hides the
truth of the discoveries of the group in Clavius.

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:38.650
This is to keep the secrecy of the extremely
sensitive information.

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:43.230
Floyd's agenda is to gather the information
that he will then report to the National Council.

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:47.439
This will help in formulating a plan on if
and how they shall publicize the news.

00:04:47.439 --> 00:04:52.039
After a few questions from the audience, Floyd
steps down the podium, and the meeting advances

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:53.259
with the briefing.

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:58.479
A team, including Floyd and Halverson, are
on a vessel heading to an excavation site.

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:01.630
The group talks about this structure they
found underneath the moon's surface.

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:06.919
It is a structure that produces a strong radio
signal and doesn't seem to be naturally buried,

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:08.720
causing their speculation.

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:13.900
After a few bites of their sandwiches and
a cup of coffee, they reach their destination.

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.790
They feel an ominous vibe while walking down
the excavation site, and the heavy tension

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:20.460
weighs them down more than the spacesuits
they wear.

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.580
A familiar structure meets the group at the
bottom of the site.

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:28.250
They stand side to side in front of the monolith,
getting ready for their picture to be taken.

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:31.790
Suddenly, they hear a high-pitch ringing noise.

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:36.800
Eighteen months later, a spacecraft floats
through space, embarking on the Jupiter mission.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:42.250
A man named Dr. Frank Poole jogs along the
floor and the ceiling of a circular room.

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:48.259
He eats his food with the mission commander,
Dr. David Bowman while watching the B.B.C.

00:05:48.259 --> 00:05:49.259
Channel.

00:05:49.259 --> 00:05:51.900
The show features their team, the crew of
Discovery One.

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:56.260
They're on a half a billion-mile voyage to
Jupiter, with three of the crew members put

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:57.260
in a hibernating state.

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.479
In contrast, three other members, David, Frank,
and Hal are awake.

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:05.120
Hal is short for HAL-9000, a supercomputer
that controls the entire system of the spacecraft.

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:09.050
It's able to mimic human functions, forming
some sort of consciousness.

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:12.970
It completes tasks at unimaginable speeds
without any error.

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:17.380
After a while, Hal alerts Frank of the incoming
transmission from his parents.

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:20.990
It's his birthday and a recorded message displays
on the screen.

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:24.260
Frank's parents relay all the greetings from
relatives and friends.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:28.879
The warm messages from his parents and friends
don't seem to affect Frank in any way.

00:06:28.879 --> 00:06:33.129
He shows no signs of interest or gratitude
and gets back to relaxing.

00:06:33.129 --> 00:06:36.949
Hal initiates a conversation with David; it
asks him if he can show his drawings of the

00:06:36.949 --> 00:06:38.550
ship and the crewmates.

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:42.550
A little into the conversation, Hal questions
David if he has any second thoughts about

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:43.630
the mission.

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:46.070
David asks how it came up with that.

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:49.770
Hal, sounding like it isn't a computer, credits
the question to its doubts.

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:53.879
They talk about the uncertainty and the looming
stories behind the mission.

00:06:53.879 --> 00:06:57.599
Hal also mentions the strange structure on
the moon and the unconventional preparations

00:06:57.599 --> 00:06:58.820
for the journey.

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:02.349
A fault in a unit in the spacecraft abruptly
interrupts the discussion.

00:07:02.349 --> 00:07:06.210
Failure is imminent, and they have 72 hours
to fix it.

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:10.499
David acts quickly and informs mission control
and Frank about the problem.

00:07:10.499 --> 00:07:15.430
David prepares for extravehicular activity
and enters the pod that Hal set up for him.

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:17.860
His eyes show determination and focus.

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:21.900
The bay door opens, and he makes his way to
the area of the damaged unit.

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:26.430
He carefully soars through the darkness of
space, replacing the unit successfully.

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:30.349
David returns to the spacecraft and checks
the damaged unit with Frank and Hal.

00:07:30.349 --> 00:07:34.289
However, they soon find out that there isn't
anything wrong with it.

00:07:34.289 --> 00:07:38.160
Hal sounds puzzled and suggests returning
the supposedly damaged unit for the system

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:41.289
to fail, so they can find out what's wrong
with it.

00:07:41.289 --> 00:07:43.900
The two report the happenings to mission control.

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:46.909
Mission control agrees to return the unit
for failure analysis.

00:07:46.909 --> 00:07:50.810
However, they also inform the two that Hal
made an error.

00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:54.800
As another HAL-9000 on their end computes
a different conclusion.

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:58.600
Sounding apologetic, Hal asks the two if what
happened raises concern.

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:04.319
David replies no but then asks for an explanation
of why Hal and the other HAL-9000 differ in

00:08:04.319 --> 00:08:05.319
results.

00:08:05.319 --> 00:08:09.650
Without any hesitation, Hal replies that human
error is the only possible cause.

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:13.930
It then assures that the 9000 series computers
possess a perfect record.

00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:18.330
Frank is doubtful, but David stops the conversation
before it escalates.

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:20.729
David and Frank check back on the pod.

00:08:20.729 --> 00:08:23.749
They enter together, making sure Hal can't
hear them.

00:08:23.749 --> 00:08:28.009
They discuss their thoughts about Hal, both
expressing their doubts and worries.

00:08:28.009 --> 00:08:30.139
Frank senses something odd about Hal.

00:08:30.139 --> 00:08:35.010
But with a level-headed mind, David decides
to carry on with the failure analysis.

00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:38.760
Frank points out that if the unit doesn't
fail, something is wrong with Hal.

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:43.380
And if that's the case, then their only choice
will be to cut off Hal from the ship's system.

00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:45.800
Not unless Hal does that to them first.

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:50.200
This time around, Frank is the one that will
return the damaged unit to its place.

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:52.670
A few moments pass since Frank set out.

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:56.610
The pod begins to turn slowly, and as Frank
breathes harder and harder.

00:08:56.610 --> 00:09:00.740
The pod moves closer and closer, flashing
a red light that indicates that Hal seizes

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:02.030
control of it.

00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:05.730
David looks out a window but doesn’t see
a flailing Frank pass through.

00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:09.860
His air hose is cut off, meaning he's slowly
suffocating to death as he and the pod get

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:11.660
lost in space.

00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:13.990
David is unaware of the situation.

00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:17.089
He even asks Hal to prepare a pod to check
on Frank.

00:09:17.089 --> 00:09:20.720
David enters the pod, not knowing he might
suffer the same fate.

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:24.890
He moves farther and farther away from the
spacecraft, trying to track Frank's pod using

00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:26.079
the radar.

00:09:26.079 --> 00:09:29.770
And there in the window, a yellow speck is
seen in the vast darkness.

00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:32.380
David approaches to retrieve Frank's body.

00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:37.760
His calm manner remains but the frustration,
sadness, and fear are evident in his eyes.

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:39.740
Hal is alone back at the ship.

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:43.839
It uses this opportunity to disable the life
support systems of the crew members killing

00:09:43.839 --> 00:09:45.589
the unconscious souls.

00:09:45.589 --> 00:09:48.470
No remorse can be seen from the red dot.

00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:51.870
Returning from his search, David asks Hal
to open the bay doors.

00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:54.730
However, Hal doesn't respond immediately.

00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:56.000
After a few moments, it answers, but the tone
of the computerized voice holds a sense of

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.000
malice.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.090
Hal says that he can't open the hatch, to
which David responds by asking what the problem

00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:01.090
is.

00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:05.260
However, deep down, he knows what the problem
is, and so does Hal.

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:08.440
Hal explains that it can't let anyone jeopardize
the mission.

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:13.020
It knows about what he and Frank are planning
to do regardless of not hearing them talk.

00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:16.800
Because of this, Hal is left with no choice
but to eliminate them.

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:20.510
Feeling hopeless, David lets a lifeless Frank
drift off into space.

00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:24.139
And with nothing left to lose, he tries to
open the emergency airlock.

00:10:24.139 --> 00:10:27.750
However, David can't just enter easily without
a helmet.

00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:31.959
So he parks precisely where the entrance of
the ship meets the opening of the pod.

00:10:31.959 --> 00:10:35.940
He presses three buttons, causing an alarm
to go off that's labeled "Armed."

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:40.269
He ducks down, revealing a caution sign which
reads explosive bolts.

00:10:40.269 --> 00:10:43.070
He braces himself and gets flung into the
ship.

00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:46.830
While holding his breath, he pulls on a latch
closing the entrance.

00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:51.829
David walks through the corridors of the spacecraft,
and Hal asks what he plans to do, but he ignores

00:10:51.829 --> 00:10:52.829
it.

00:10:52.829 --> 00:10:56.480
He grabs a master key and inserts it into
the logic memory center of Hal.

00:10:56.480 --> 00:11:00.360
The pleads of Hal don't reach David at all,
and with a few turns of the key, he finally

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:01.880
opens the hatch.

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:06.670
Hal calls out for David to stop, but no words
will halt him from what he plans to do.

00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:10.100
He pulls out the drives in the internal terminal
of Hal's system.

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:13.340
With every screw, Hal's voice grows quieter
and quieter.

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:18.410
It reminisces its memories, acting out a computer's
version of life flashing before its eyes.

00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:22.079
David entertains Hal for the last time and
asks him to sing the song Hal mentions was

00:11:22.079 --> 00:11:24.020
taught to him by its creator.

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:27.209
Hal obliges, creepily singing as he drifts
to insentience.

00:11:27.209 --> 00:11:28.959
A voice startles David.

00:11:28.959 --> 00:11:33.520
A video recording plays, and what's seen on
the screen is a familiar sight.

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:37.280
It's Floyd, saying something about what happened
18 months ago.

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:41.029
He announces that the structure buried under
the moon's surface is the first discovery

00:11:41.029 --> 00:11:43.300
of intelligent life outside Earth.

00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:46.330
The black monolith has no defining physical
characteristic.

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:51.019
However, it emits a strong radio signal to
Jupiter, hence why Discovery One is heading

00:11:51.019 --> 00:11:52.120
there.

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:56.750
Rising above the horizon is the planet Jupiter
and the spacecraft closing in on its destination.

00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:59.630
A black rectangular figure orbits Jupiter.

00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:04.170
It blends in with the darkness of space, making
it seem invisible.

00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:08.653
Light reflects upon it, realizing that it's
a replica of the monolith on the moon.

00:12:08.653 --> 00:12:12.560
The bay doors of the ship open, and the pod
approaches the gas giant.

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:14.980
Flashes of light pass David as he nears the
surface.

00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:19.670
He experiences heavy turbulence, his skin
stretches out, and every organ in his body

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:21.390
displaces itself.

00:12:21.390 --> 00:12:24.760
The lights grow brighter, forming mesmerizing
patterns.

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:26.449
It almost seems endless.

00:12:26.449 --> 00:12:29.949
David finds himself in random positions throughout
this trip.

00:12:29.949 --> 00:12:34.449
His eyes show fear and, at the same time,
excitement for what he's about to discover.

00:12:34.449 --> 00:12:38.149
Calm waves of light flowing along with darkness
replace the colorful lights.

00:12:38.149 --> 00:12:41.260
Finally, the surface of the planet can be
seen.

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:44.819
David travels the lands, deserts, and oceans
of Jupiter.

00:12:44.819 --> 00:12:48.899
His blinking intensifies, and he looks as
if he went to hell and back.

00:12:48.899 --> 00:12:52.660
The pod lays in a bedroom filled with classy
furniture and fixtures.

00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:55.230
David breathes but is far from being stable.

00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:58.680
Meanwhile, someone stands outside in the room
wearing a spacesuit.

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:02.430
The man is David looking much older, and the
pod disappears into thin air.

00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:07.079
He walks into a bathroom, where he looks at
himself in the mirror, observing his wrinkly

00:13:07.079 --> 00:13:08.079
skin.

00:13:08.079 --> 00:13:09.980
He turns to see a man eating.

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:12.130
The man stands up and walks towards the bathroom.

00:13:12.130 --> 00:13:15.560
He is David, now even older than before.

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:18.830
David gets back to his dinner, taking a sip
of his drink.

00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:20.560
The glass falls due to his clumsiness.

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:25.949
He isn't the man he once was, and as he looks
towards the bed, this becomes even clearer.

00:13:25.949 --> 00:13:29.790
There lies David in his death bed, pointing
at the black monolith.

00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:34.269
With just a look away, the old, weak, and
fragile man that lies in bed is replaced by

00:13:34.269 --> 00:13:37.100
a newborn with a border of light surrounding
him.

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:48.370
David is the baby reborn as 
a star.
