00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:07.747
hey what's up guys

00:00:07.891 --> 00:00:12.883
today I'll show you a horror-action animation film: "Resident Evil-Infinite Darkness" 

00:00:13.171 --> 00:00:16.051
spoiler ahead, watch out and take care

00:00:16.435 --> 00:00:18.355
since the outbreak of the zombie virus

00:00:18.451 --> 00:00:21.763
all countries have worked together to bring the virus under control

00:00:21.907 --> 00:00:24.163
the crisis caused by the virus is settled

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:26.755
but wars among humans break out everywhere

00:00:26.899 --> 00:00:29.251
small countries suffer a lot from the war

00:00:29.395 --> 00:00:30.691
cities are destroyed

00:00:30.787 --> 00:00:34.435
lots of people are forced to leave their hometowns to live in refugee camps

00:00:34.723 --> 00:00:39.139
Claire, who survived the zombie war, now works as a social worker

00:00:39.427 --> 00:00:42.403
she often visits the refugees and brings them supplies

00:00:42.643 --> 00:00:47.779
once during an aid mission in Penamstan, she sees a mysterious painting from a local kid

00:00:48.067 --> 00:00:51.331
the painting depicts zombies attacking humans, which is scary

00:00:51.571 --> 00:00:55.939
meanwhile, agent Shen May is called to attend an emergency meeting in the White House

00:00:56.131 --> 00:01:00.499
besides Shen May, also attending the meeting are agent Leon and the Noodle Hair 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:06.211
the Blonde Guy, a war hero who fought in the civil war in Penamstan, is also in attendance

00:01:06.355 --> 00:01:09.955
the US government provides military assistance to government forces

00:01:10.195 --> 00:01:13.891
a few hours ago, the White House was attacked by a hacking incident

00:01:14.083 --> 00:01:17.395
top-secret presidential documents have been accessed illegally 

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:21.715
since the server uses a LAN, nobody can access it from outside

00:01:21.955 --> 00:01:24.595
the president suspects there is a mole in the White House

00:01:24.739 --> 00:01:27.955
they have checked all the monitors, but find nothing suspicious

00:01:28.195 --> 00:01:32.899
so the president and the defense minister gather the group, hoping they can find the mole

00:01:33.235 --> 00:01:35.443
right then, there is a sudden blackout

00:01:35.635 --> 00:01:37.219
everyone is on high alert

00:01:37.411 --> 00:01:39.715
agents go out to check what is going on

00:01:39.907 --> 00:01:43.507
the Noodle Hair encounters an infected employee, now a zombie

00:01:43.651 --> 00:01:45.763
luckily, Leon comes to help in time

00:01:46.003 --> 00:01:48.547
he shoots the employee and saves the Noodle Hair 

00:01:48.931 --> 00:01:50.131
seeing zombies there

00:01:50.227 --> 00:01:54.019
they return to the office and escort the president to a secret bunker

00:01:54.355 --> 00:01:57.139
the Noodle Hair is responsible for protecting the president

00:01:57.331 --> 00:02:01.939
while Leon, the Blonde Guy and Shen May deal with the zombies outside the bunker

00:02:02.131 --> 00:02:05.299
luckily, there are not many zombies inside the White House

00:02:05.491 --> 00:02:07.795
soon, they manage to kill all the zombies

00:02:08.035 --> 00:02:11.683
the next day, a medical team come and remove all the bodies

00:02:11.827 --> 00:02:16.195
Leon and the Blonde Guy wonder where the zombies came from and who is behind all this

00:02:16.435 --> 00:02:18.115
Leon starts to investigate

00:02:18.355 --> 00:02:21.523
meanwhile, Claire comes to the White House to apply for funds 

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:24.835
so as to build hospitals and schools in the refugee camps

00:02:25.027 --> 00:02:29.011
Claire meets Leon and shows him the painting she saw in Penamstan

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:32.179
according to its clues, she thinks during the civil war 

00:02:32.227 --> 00:02:35.251
somebody has used biochemical weapons in Penamstan

00:02:35.395 --> 00:02:37.603
Leon believes Claire is overthinking it

00:02:37.795 --> 00:02:42.547
the defense minister finds that the secret file accessed by the hacker is related to China

00:02:42.691 --> 00:02:46.819
including the information about a Shanghai-based biological research facility

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:49.651
therefore, he assumes that the Chinese are behind it

00:02:49.795 --> 00:02:52.435
he hopes the president can send Leon to investigate

00:02:52.675 --> 00:02:57.667
later, Leon, the Blonde Guy, and Shen May are sent to China by the newest stealth submarine

00:02:57.763 --> 00:03:02.179
with the mission to break into the research facility to find out if it is all related

00:03:02.323 --> 00:03:05.299
while the Noodle Hair stays behind to protect the president

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:08.755
on the other side, Claire finds there is more behind the painting

00:03:09.043 --> 00:03:12.403
so she researches further and learns that during the Penamstan civil war

00:03:12.547 --> 00:03:14.563
the US sent an army troop there

00:03:14.803 --> 00:03:19.939
the American army was resisted by local people and forced to withdraw from Penamstan

00:03:20.131 --> 00:03:23.347
not long after that, all soldiers killed themselves at home

00:03:23.587 --> 00:03:26.419
only the Blonde Guy and another soldier survived

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:29.059
one night, when Leon is walking around

00:03:29.203 --> 00:03:32.611
he happens to see the Blonde Guy injecting himself in the toilet

00:03:32.899 --> 00:03:34.723
so he asks him what is going on

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:38.851
the Blonde Guy tells him that there was a virus outbreak in Penamstan

00:03:38.995 --> 00:03:41.539
the US worried that the virus would spread

00:03:41.587 --> 00:03:43.939
so they sent the Blonde Guy and a troop there to 'help'

00:03:44.083 --> 00:03:46.435
however, once an American soldier died there

00:03:46.531 --> 00:03:51.235
the US government could use it as an excuse to launch an attack and destroy the whole city

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:54.115
resulting in claiming many innocent lives there

00:03:54.355 --> 00:03:58.147
feeling guilty for that, some of the soldiers chose to commit suicide

00:03:58.243 --> 00:04:01.507
the Blonde Guy has resorted to tranquilizers ever since

00:04:01.843 --> 00:04:04.147
right then, the submarine shakes violently

00:04:04.435 --> 00:04:08.467
they rush to the cockpit, but only to find many dead bodies of the crew

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:11.443
there is a terrifying look and scratches on their faces

00:04:11.587 --> 00:04:14.995
Leon and the Blonde Guy decide to hunt the murderer separately

00:04:15.235 --> 00:04:19.075
Leon is horrified to see some infected rats coming out of a dead body

00:04:19.171 --> 00:04:21.619
he knows it is a military biological weapon

00:04:21.811 --> 00:04:24.931
but he doesn't understand how this thing appears on the submarine

00:04:25.123 --> 00:04:29.635
still in confusion, he sees countless infected rats burst out of the bodies

00:04:30.019 --> 00:04:32.371
the emergency alarm goes off at the same time

00:04:32.467 --> 00:04:37.075
showing that the submarine self-destruction program will be activated in 5 minutes

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:39.139
Leon runs to the rescue capsule

00:04:39.235 --> 00:04:42.403
the Blonde Guy and Shen May are waiting for him there already

00:04:42.595 --> 00:04:46.147
the three of them evacuate the submarine together in an escape pod

00:04:46.339 --> 00:04:50.131
when the US government hears of this, they start an investigation immediately

00:04:50.371 --> 00:04:54.451
and find that when the submarine exploded, a Chinese fleet was nearby

00:04:54.787 --> 00:04:57.907
so the defense minister blames the destruction on the Chinese

00:04:58.195 --> 00:05:03.235
as things get worse, the defense minister decides to raise the national emergency level

00:05:03.427 --> 00:05:07.939
Leon and others land in Shanghai safely and arrive at a safe house

00:05:08.227 --> 00:05:13.075
when Shen May uses a dagger to open the door, Leon spots there is blood on it

00:05:13.219 --> 00:05:18.403
he realizes it was Shen May and the Blonde Guy that actually killed the crew on the submarine

00:05:18.643 --> 00:05:21.091
Leon asks the Blonde Guy why they did it

00:05:21.235 --> 00:05:22.867
the Blonde Guy is very frank

00:05:23.011 --> 00:05:27.667
he tells Leon they are looking for evidence to expose the conspiracy of the US government

00:05:27.811 --> 00:05:31.267
he is full of hatred for America after what happened in Penamstan

00:05:31.363 --> 00:05:33.571
and determined to expose what they did

00:05:33.811 --> 00:05:36.259
suddenly, the Blonde Guy takes out a gun

00:05:36.403 --> 00:05:39.283
Leon shoots him first and fights with Shen May

00:05:39.379 --> 00:05:43.459
Shen May realizes she is no match for Leon, so she escapes out

00:05:43.843 --> 00:05:46.435
then, she comes to meet her grandfather in a manor

00:05:46.579 --> 00:05:50.899
but never expects Leon to follow her there and take a security guard hostage

00:05:51.187 --> 00:05:53.587
Leon also sees her infected brother there

00:05:53.779 --> 00:05:56.563
at this point, Shen May has to tell him the truth

00:05:56.755 --> 00:06:00.979
the defense minister works with a pharmaceutical company making bio-chemical weapons

00:06:01.171 --> 00:06:03.571
and Penamstan was a test-run for the weapons 

00:06:03.907 --> 00:06:06.547
Shen May's brother is one of the bioweapon soldiers

00:06:06.643 --> 00:06:09.139
who was sent to Penamstan to test the weapon

00:06:09.331 --> 00:06:11.779
however, the virus spread by accident

00:06:11.923 --> 00:06:15.331
causing many civilians to be infected and to become zombies

00:06:15.715 --> 00:06:18.499
during the evacuation, they were stopped by the rebels

00:06:18.691 --> 00:06:23.155
when this comes to light, the defense minister sent the Blonde Guy and a troop to Penamstan

00:06:23.251 --> 00:06:27.139
attempting to cover the whole incident and rescue the people working for him

00:06:27.283 --> 00:06:32.323
when the Blonde Guy and his team arrived, Shen May's brother was the only survivor

00:06:32.515 --> 00:06:35.203
they were attacked by zombies during the evacuation 

00:06:35.299 --> 00:06:37.603
as a result, everyone had been infected

00:06:37.795 --> 00:06:42.067
in order to save them, Shen May's brother gave the Blonde Guy the virus inhibitor

00:06:42.115 --> 00:06:44.035
but became a zombie himself

00:06:44.131 --> 00:06:48.595
the Blonde Guy didn't report to headquarters about Shen May's brother after he returned

00:06:48.643 --> 00:06:54.019
instead, he contacted Shen May's grandfather and sent her brother's body to Shanghai

00:06:54.355 --> 00:06:58.195
there is still some virus remaining in the Blonde Guy and other soldiers' bodies

00:06:58.291 --> 00:07:00.067
in order to survive the infection

00:07:00.163 --> 00:07:02.851
they need to get more inhibitors from the defense minister

00:07:03.043 --> 00:07:05.827
the defense minister threatens them with the inhibitor

00:07:05.923 --> 00:07:08.755
directing them to conduct cruel missions for him

00:07:08.899 --> 00:07:11.827
most of the soldiers in the Blonde Guy's team committed suicide 

00:07:11.923 --> 00:07:14.035
because they couldn't stand his control

00:07:14.179 --> 00:07:17.059
as the defense minister desires more money and power

00:07:17.155 --> 00:07:19.795
he takes the inhibitor as his trump card

00:07:19.987 --> 00:07:23.587
he planned the attack in the White House and the destruction of the submarine

00:07:23.683 --> 00:07:26.323
hoping to start a war between America and China

00:07:26.419 --> 00:07:30.835
through all of which, he can take use of his bioweapons and the virus inhibitors 

00:07:30.931 --> 00:07:33.091
to gain more money and power

00:07:33.235 --> 00:07:36.200
Shen May has been looking for evidence to destroy the defense minister 

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:37.650
for the death of her brother

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:41.251
and the Blonde Guy wants to eliminate the defense minister's control

00:07:41.347 --> 00:07:43.219
so they decide to work together

00:07:43.603 --> 00:07:47.575
after 6 years of investigation, they finally gather enough evidence

00:07:47.877 --> 00:07:52.677
all bioweapon soldiers are implanted with a chip to record their vitals and their combat data

00:07:52.965 --> 00:07:56.949
that chip contains information such as who created him and who sent him into battle

00:07:57.045 --> 00:07:59.733
there is also a chip in Shen May's brother's body

00:07:59.877 --> 00:08:02.469
the Blonde Guy didn't report her brother back then

00:08:02.565 --> 00:08:05.973
so the defense minister thought all bioweapon soldiers were dead

00:08:06.165 --> 00:08:08.375
Shen May believes if they go public with the chip

00:08:08.375 --> 00:08:11.075
they could expose the defense minister's conspiracy

00:08:11.325 --> 00:08:14.625
suddenly, the manor is bombed, and the building collapses

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:17.775
Leon struggles hard to save Shen May out

00:08:17.983 --> 00:08:21.151
but her brother and grandfather are buried there forever

00:08:21.487 --> 00:08:24.559
right then, Leon believes that the Blonde Guy is still alive 

00:08:24.607 --> 00:08:28.575
because only he could know this place and should be responsible for the bomb

00:08:28.575 --> 00:08:32.800
in the meantime, Claire finds the other survivor in the Blonde Guy's team 

00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:35.325
according to the information she got from the news

00:08:35.325 --> 00:08:38.911
unfortunately, when she arrives, he has shot himself

00:08:39.055 --> 00:08:43.663
Claire finds a diary where he wrote down every detail that happened in Penamstan

00:08:43.807 --> 00:08:47.215
she goes to confront the defense minister about the conspiracy

00:08:47.359 --> 00:08:50.191
but she is then captured by the defense minister's men

00:08:50.383 --> 00:08:53.263
Leon doesn't agree with making the chip public now

00:08:53.407 --> 00:08:57.439
because he believes that the defense minister's men will retaliate against Shen May

00:08:57.631 --> 00:09:01.375
and also, the Blonde Guy didn't do this for the sake of justice

00:09:01.663 --> 00:09:03.679
he just wants the world to suffer like him

00:09:03.871 --> 00:09:06.895
hearing that, Shen May loses herself in her thoughts

00:09:07.039 --> 00:09:10.687
they decide to return to America to stop the defense minister

00:09:10.783 --> 00:09:15.439
in the meantime, he calls the Noodle Hair and asks him to tell the president the truth

00:09:15.439 --> 00:09:20.050
Claire wakes up in a lab, and the defense minister is standing right in front of her

00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:23.425
he confides to her that he does not only develop bioweapons

00:09:23.425 --> 00:09:26.431
but also makes bioweapon soldiers for future wars

00:09:26.719 --> 00:09:31.519
the president is going to hold a press conference and take a firm stance against China

00:09:31.663 --> 00:09:34.255
just then, the Blonde Guy appears in the lab

00:09:34.351 --> 00:09:38.767
the defense minister still wants to control the Blonde Guy with the virus inhibitor 

00:09:38.911 --> 00:09:40.399
but it doesn't work anymore

00:09:40.543 --> 00:09:44.527
because the Blonde Guy injected himself with the newest virus before he came there 

00:09:44.623 --> 00:09:46.975
and turns into a horrible monster suddenly

00:09:47.167 --> 00:09:49.471
he kills the defense minister easily

00:09:49.663 --> 00:09:53.743
soon the AI system in the base detects that there is biochemical leakage

00:09:53.887 --> 00:09:56.575
and starts the cleansing procedure automatically

00:09:56.767 --> 00:10:01.375
acid pours into the base from all directions to destroy all the bioweapons

00:10:01.519 --> 00:10:05.119
not long after, Leon and Shen May arrive at the lab

00:10:05.263 --> 00:10:09.103
Shen May stands in front of the Blonde Guy, trying to stop him

00:10:09.247 --> 00:10:11.215
she can't bear to see the Blonde Guy

00:10:11.263 --> 00:10:14.335
a good man who saved her brother, has become a monster

00:10:14.575 --> 00:10:17.071
the Blonde Guy doesn't listen and kills her

00:10:17.215 --> 00:10:19.855
he has lost himself and goes on a rampage

00:10:20.047 --> 00:10:24.367
he wants to get out and kill more people, making everyone suffer from the virus

00:10:24.703 --> 00:10:27.775
later, Leon finds Claire and sets her free

00:10:27.919 --> 00:10:32.575
Leon finds a rocket launcher and fires at the Blonde Guy but misses it

00:10:32.767 --> 00:10:36.847
enraged by that, the monster throws an iron bridge at Leon and Claire

00:10:37.039 --> 00:10:40.927
Leon manages to avoid it, but Claire is hit and knocked out

00:10:41.359 --> 00:10:43.951
when the monster is close to escaping through the roof 

00:10:43.999 --> 00:10:45.151
Leon pulls a lever

00:10:45.247 --> 00:10:49.327
causing the whole floor to fall into the sea of acid, including the monster

00:10:49.519 --> 00:10:50.863
who dies in an instant

00:10:51.055 --> 00:10:53.599
while Leon holds onto a chain and escapes 

00:10:53.839 --> 00:10:57.055
moments later, right before making his speech to the public

00:10:57.151 --> 00:11:00.895
the president receives the important message from Leon and the Noodle Hair
