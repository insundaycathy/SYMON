00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.760
hello everyone welcome to film time today&nbsp;
let's watch a fantasy movie the hidden wall&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:11.360
a woman who remained by a calendar began to&nbsp;
record what she encountered in the recent years&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:17.200
however since she has been alone for so long&nbsp;
she gradually loses track of how much memory&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:23.200
in her head is real before the accident the&nbsp;
preoccupied woman was warmly invited by mr&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:29.360
and mrs linda to a cabin in the woods at the&nbsp;
foot of the alps after arriving at 3 pm the old&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:34.480
couple went shopping for some supplies they&nbsp;
wanted to go back before the sky went dark&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.920
however until the woman went to sleep that&nbsp;
night she didn't see the old couple return&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.960
the next day the woman woke up to find&nbsp;
that the old couple left the dog luxe has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.160
been digging up the door she was worried she&nbsp;
took lux towards the direction of the village&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.480
walking along the mountain road the woman&nbsp;
soon heard lux's whale when she called lutz&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.120
to continue she found a transparent wall that&nbsp;
didn't seem to exist on the sunny mountain road&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.160
the woman wanted to move forward but the&nbsp;
wall that she touched made her into confusion&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:12.240
after repeatedly confirming that she could not&nbsp;
leave she decided to temporarily return to the hut&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.400
to her delight she found another inhabited&nbsp;
hut on the halfway she wanted to go ask&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.320
for help but she found that she was still&nbsp;
separated from the hut by a hidden barrier&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.960
the couple in front of the house was as&nbsp;
if they were frozen staying in a strange&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.360
state of stillness such an encounter&nbsp;
makes the woman don't know what to do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.560
in the company of her dog lux she returned&nbsp;
to the mountain trail for confirmation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.920
after finding that the hidden wall still&nbsp;
existed he returned to the cabin in the woods&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.760
with doubt and helplessness she had a nightmare of&nbsp;
being trapped in the cabin by the hidden wall dot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.840
in order to find out the scope of the hidden wall&nbsp;
the woman began to drive on the mountain road&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.680
on the way she saw a jeep&nbsp;
abandoned on the side of the road&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.960
as she drove toward the car with excitement she&nbsp;
hit the hidden wall since she didn't slow down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.000
the impact broke her head in a trance she was&nbsp;
once again swallowed by the emotion of despair&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.680
in order to escape the fear brought by the hidden&nbsp;
wall the woman has been trying to numb herself&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:21.840
with work for the past 10 days after experiencing&nbsp;
conflicts and struggles the woman eventually&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:28.480
decided to live for the dog lux and the cowbella&nbsp;
as mr and mrs linda prepare enough food in the hut&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:34.480
the woman started planting and working for her&nbsp;
future survival before long she found a kitten in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:40.080
the rain with the company of these small animals&nbsp;
the woman began to have a spiritual support&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.360
since the woman did not know how to use&nbsp;
a gun her first attempt to hunt failed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:51.760
and she got knocked on the head by the recoil she&nbsp;
did not get discouraged she followed the dog to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:58.880
the crashed car she found a map in the car the&nbsp;
map led her to a hunting lodge located higher up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.440
after a night of trekking the woman&nbsp;
saw a lumber truck in the woods&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.920
and not surprisingly she was still separated&nbsp;
from the lumber truck by a hidden wall&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.040
after arriving at the hunting lodge in the&nbsp;
mountain the woman generally understood the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:18.800
situation around as far as the eye can see&nbsp;
there seems to be no trace of anyone alive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.160
after packing up the available things in the&nbsp;
hut the woman rested for a while under the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.600
warm sunlight when she woke up again it was&nbsp;
already late and she could only return to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:36.240
the old couple's hut before dark it wasn't long&nbsp;
before the woman began to write through writing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:41.040
she can not only record her life in the hidden&nbsp;
wall but also tried to relieve her depression&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.400
besides her hunting skills were improving and&nbsp;
she was able to catch the prey in the woods&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:52.880
the kitten he took in at first gave birth to&nbsp;
a pure white cub the woman named the new life&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.840
pearl it was pearl's birth that made the&nbsp;
woman realize she must be responsible for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:03.680
these forests which brought her hope she began&nbsp;
to work hard and cultivate more crops and lands&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:09.760
in addition to the fatigue and pain caused by the&nbsp;
work the existence of the hidden wall also let&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:15.680
the woman fell into deep sadness fortunately with&nbsp;
the desire for life and the love for these small&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:21.920
animals the woman became strong again she stocked&nbsp;
up on more supplies and more abundant ingredients&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.840
however there's no one she could communicate&nbsp;
with this unresolved anguish was soon deluded by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:34.080
the optimism and simplicity of the dog luxury the&nbsp;
life in the woods was not as peaceful as the woman&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:40.880
had expected as the winter ends the hot summer&nbsp;
brings more worries the nightly remembrance of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.960
the sound of deer and the death of the kitten&nbsp;
made the woman's nights even more difficult&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:51.280
with winter coming again the woman rethought the&nbsp;
meaning of life in the snowy sky and such thinking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:58.320
changed her perspective on life the belly of the&nbsp;
cow bella gradually became bigger it makes the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:04.400
woman feel hope again unfortunately the woman who&nbsp;
hunted in the cold became ill in the winter days&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:10.560
and once again fell in boredom and helplessness&nbsp;
to the woman's relief bella soon gave birth to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:16.480
a young bull the rotation of life made the woman&nbsp;
more dependent on the presence of the dog luxury&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:22.240
as the season changed the woman packed up some of&nbsp;
her belongings and brought her companions to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:28.160
summer pasture in this wonderful place the woman&nbsp;
felt the joy that nature brought to her again&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:34.480
also the life of a dog a cat and two cows allowed&nbsp;
her to immerse herself in this pleasant time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:40.320
the unpolluted paradise the bright starry&nbsp;
sky and the time that seems to stop all let&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:46.160
the woman felt a sense of peace and happiness&nbsp;
therefore she stopped her daily writing sinking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:51.840
herself into living with this world however this&nbsp;
kind of life didn't stop the change from coming&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:57.440
as she moved back from the summer pasture&nbsp;
she began to keep the diary regularly again&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:01.840
she found that her memory could not&nbsp;
correspond to his previous records&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:08.000
the woman gradually lost track of the changes in&nbsp;
time as she lived day after day and worked year&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:15.440
after year then he suddenly found a flock of crows&nbsp;
on the tree outside the house among these crows a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:20.960
white crow appeared so out of place the woman&nbsp;
seemed to feel some kind of resonance of life&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:27.280
she began to use her own food waste to help the&nbsp;
little guy who was rejected by his peers survive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:33.040
the winter this tacit understanding and the&nbsp;
tranquility of life let her ignore the existence&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:40.240
of the hidden wall however the quiet and peaceful&nbsp;
life was soon broken by an intruder the bull which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:46.480
was already an adult was killed lux also fell in&nbsp;
a pool of blood under the man's frenzied attack&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:52.560
because she hadn't seen any humans for a long time&nbsp;
by the time the woman took up her weapon and shot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:59.120
the intruder dead lux was no longer alive after&nbsp;
carrying lux to the top of the hill for burial&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:05.120
the woman rolled the man's body down the slope&nbsp;
in addition she also pacified the restless bella&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:10.320
the loss of lux not only made the woman's&nbsp;
life lost a certain joy and passion&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:16.400
but her soul also seems to be missing falling&nbsp;
into depression after a long period of pain&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:22.400
the woman finally regained her composure she&nbsp;
chose to continue facing the future life bravely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:27.600
however with all the paper being used up&nbsp;
the woman can no longer record her life&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:33.040
at this time the sky is still bright she&nbsp;
only had a carefree cat in front of her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:38.800
and the silence of the loss of luxury although&nbsp;
the bull pearl and lux had left him once she saw&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:43.600
the group of crows circling outside the house the&nbsp;
woman knew that the white crow that had long been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:48.720
familiar with her would continue to wait for&nbsp;
her under the tree well that's it for today's&nbsp;&nbsp;
