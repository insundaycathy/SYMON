00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:01.740
Welcome to Moviecaps.

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:07.309
Today I will show you a Horror, Mystery, Thriller
film from 2017, titled Get Out.

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:08.790
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.669
Watch out and take care.

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:15.050
Rose arrives at her photographer boyfriend
Chris's apartment with pastries and coffee.

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:18.580
They're getting ready to go away for the weekend
to visit her family and he's concerned that

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.080
they don't know she's dating a black guy.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.860
She assures him that, while they will likely
say some stupid things, they are incredibly

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:26.010
progressive.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.030
Her dad would have even voted for Obama a
third time if he could have.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:34.510
Chris asks if he's the only black guy she’s
ever dated and she says he is, but she's confident

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.000
that her parents will be totally cool.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.720
On the ride to her parent’s home, Chris
goes for a cigarette, but Rose takes it and

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:45.230
throws it out the window, warning that her
parents would hate that she dates a smoker.

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.860
Chris calls his buddy Rod, a TSA agent at
the local airport, and reminds him to take

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.630
care of his dog and not to feed him "people
food."

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:56.940
Rod, disapproving of Chris dating a white
woman, berates him and says visiting the white

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.750
folk is a bad idea.

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.430
He also flirts a bit with Rose, and Rose thinks
it's sweet when Chris gets a bit jealous.

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.460
While they're deep in conversation and not
entirely paying attention to the road, a deer

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.170
darts out in front of the car and gets hit.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.649
They pull over to investigate and call the
police, who ask what they're doing in the

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:14.810
area.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.090
Rose tells them that they're visiting her
family who live nearby.

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.670
The officer asks to see Chris's ID, but Rose
steps in and says that because he wasn't driving

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.240
there's no need for that.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.030
The officer lets them go, and Chris tells
Rose that it was hot the way she stood up

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.509
for him to the racist policeman.

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.350
Chris and Rose arrive at her parent’s home
and are greeted with a warm welcome.

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.850
Her father, Dean Armitage, is a neurosurgeon
who tells Chris that he would have voted for

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.329
Obama a third time if he could have.

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:44.979
Her mother, Missy Armitage, is a hypnotherapist.

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:49.740
While Dean is giving a tour of his house,
he introduces Chris to Georgina, the housekeeper,

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.920
and Walter, the groundskeeper.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.539
Dean acknowledges that it looks bad, two wealthy
white people having two helpers who are black,

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:59.849
but they were hired to take care of his parents
and Dean would have felt bad letting them

00:01:59.849 --> 00:02:00.969
go.

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:03.329
They all get together for afternoon tea.

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.759
Missy stirs her tea and lightly taps her spoon
against the teacup three times.

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:11.489
Chris explains his family situation, that
his father left when he was young and his

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:14.340
mother died after being hit by a car when
he was 11.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.599
Chris is uneasy, that’s when Dean talks
about his smoking addiction and that Missy

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:22.769
can help him with his nicotine addiction through
hypnosis, but he doesn't feel cool with people

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:24.650
tooling around in his head.

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.629
While pouring Chris a drink, Georgina sort
of short-circuits, and Missy tells her to

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:30.129
go get some rest.

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:33.730
The Armitages tell Rose that they're having
their big party tomorrow.

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.079
She's surprised and they remind her that it's
the same day every year.

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:39.250
Rose's brother Jeremy arrives.

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.590
He's an aggressive spoiled rich kid.

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.550
That night at dinner a drunk Jeremy starts
telling stories about Rose, when Missy goes

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:50.549
to get dessert, Chris sees Georgina standing
with a cake in an intimidating pose, he starts

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:52.049
getting unsettled.

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:55.670
Chris and Rose retire to their room where
she apologizes for her family and they go

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:56.840
to sleep.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.859
Chris can’t fall asleep so he sneaks out
for a smoke.

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:03.550
While outside he sees Walter charging at him
in the distance, but at the last moment he

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.969
makes a sharp turn and runs off.

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:10.000
Shortly after he gets frightened by Georgina
staring at her reflection in the glass door,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.569
making him unsettled.

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:15.560
When sneaking back to his room, Missy intercepts
him by turning on a light.

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.640
She reiterates that smoking is a bad habit
and insists on helping him quit.

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.750
He sits down but mocks the notion of hypnotism,
unaware that she is slowly hypnotizing him,

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.180
using her teaspoon as a focus object.

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.249
She brings him back to the night his mom died
when he was 11 and starts asking him questions

00:03:31.249 --> 00:03:35.599
which he is uncomfortable answering but he
doesn't seem to be in control anymore.

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:39.480
Chris is doing the same thing he did back
then, digging his nails into the arms of the

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.590
chair and starts feeling pain and regret,
for not doing more that day.

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.189
She taps her teacup with her spoon three times
and tells him to sink.

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:51.510
Eleven-year-old Chris sinks into his bed,
while present-day Chris sinks into blackness,

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.790
seeing himself and Missy far above.

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.920
His consciousness has left his body, which
is paralyzed in the chair.

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.889
Chris wakes up, thinking that all of that
was a nightmare.

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:04.569
He sees that Rod has sent him a picture of
him pretending to give his dog beer and plugs

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:05.799
in his phone.

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:10.150
He makes small talk with Walter, and gets
weirded out by his responses, he also learns

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.379
that last night wasn’t a dream.

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:16.320
Chris tells Rose that he thinks her mom hypnotized
him last night; he has vague recollection

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.970
of what happened and the thought of a cigarette
makes him want to throw up.

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.010
The Armitages' wealthy friends arrive for
the big party.

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:27.190
It's mostly older white people who keep making
comments about his build and looks.

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.510
He gets uncomfortable and wanders off.

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:33.990
He notices another black guy (Andre), about
the same age as him and Chris tries to bond

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:37.530
with him, but he also acts stiff and unnatural
like Walter and Georgina.

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:42.960
When a lady comes to separate them Chris tries
to fist bump him, instead, Andre grabs his

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.590
hand like a handshake.

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:48.730
The lady brings him to a group of people and
Andre shows himself off.

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:50.950
Something about him feels familiar to Chris.

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:54.820
He then leaves and finds a blind man named
Jim who says that all the people at the party

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.050
are ignorant.

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.140
He's an art dealer and Chris is well aware
of who he is.

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:01.750
Jim says that he's a fan of Chris's work.

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:06.250
He recognizes the irony of a blind art dealer
but tells him that he has a really good assistant

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:08.180
who is great at describing pieces.

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:12.210
Chris feels like this was his first normal
conversation today.

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:16.210
As he enters the house, all the guests are
talking, but when Chris gets up the stairs

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:18.990
they go completely silent and listen to what
he does.

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.790
He goes in the room and finds his phone unplugged.

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:24.810
Chris calls Rod and tells him everything that’s
been going on.

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:29.320
Rod becomes overly suspicious and starts connecting
the dots, like how the other black people

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.340
there are hypnotized and that he needs to
get out of there.

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:34.830
Chris tells him to cut the crap and hangs
up.

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:38.760
Chris tells Rose that someone unplugged his
phone and how weird everything is.

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:42.900
She tells him he's just being paranoid because
he's in an uncomfortable situation and walks

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:43.900
away.

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:48.560
Chris is about to leave, he's blocked by Georgina
who apologizes for unplugging his “cellular

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.640
phone” in an unusual manner.

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:53.760
He says that it's fine and that he didn't
mean to rat her out.

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.430
She doesn't understand.

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:58.430
So he clarifies that he didn't mean to get
her in trouble.

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:01.900
She gets weird and lets out a single tear
while telling him that the Armitages treat

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:03.350
her like family.

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:06.320
He just assumes that Georgina is crazy.

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:10.240
Chris goes back outside and tries to discreetly
take Logan's picture with his phone to send

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.320
it to Rod, but has forgotten to turn off the
flash.

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:17.520
As soon as his phone flashes he goes from
overly prim and proper to gibberish.

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:20.820
His nose starts bleeding and he jumps at Chris
telling him, "Get out!

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:23.590
Get the hell out while you still can!"

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:25.570
Rose is freaked out now too.

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:29.302
She asks her dad what happened and he explains
that the flash just caused the man to have

00:06:29.302 --> 00:06:30.450
a seizure.

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:35.320
The man comes out and apologizes for upsetting
everyone and says he must return home.

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:39.090
Chris and Rose go for a walk and Chris tells
her that he's sure he recognized the guy and

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:41.950
that something strange is definitely going
on.

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:45.460
She agrees by saying that it did not seem
like a seizure at all.

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:48.110
Chris says that he'd really like to go home
now.

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:49.950
Rose reluctantly agrees.

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:52.800
She says she will make up something to tell
her parents.

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:56.750
Meanwhile at the terrace, Dean is holding
a silent auction with his guests, who hold

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:58.510
up bingo cards to bid.

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:00.540
Next to him is a picture of Chris.

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:02.600
Jim wins the auction.

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:06.170
Chris goes to pack his belongings and gets
a call from Rod, who tells him that the guy

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:10.460
in the picture is a guy they knew named Andre,
who used to work at a movie theater but went

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:12.070
missing some weeks ago.

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:13.910
The phone battery dies.

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:16.410
Chris notices that the closet door is open.

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:20.410
He looks inside and finds a red box filled
with photos of Rose posed romantically with

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:22.220
many other black guys.

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:26.250
There are also photos of her with both Walter
and Georgina, who don't resemble the robotic

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:28.020
versions Chris has met.

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:32.070
Apparently Chris isn't the first black guy
Rose has been with after all.

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:36.200
Rose returns and Chris says that he needs
the keys to put their bags in the car.

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:39.750
She looks for them in her purse as they make
their way downstairs.

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:41.790
Jeremy is blocking the front door.

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:43.800
Dean and Missy are there too.

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:47.820
Jeremy aggressively nears Chris, but Missy
and Dean tell him to calm down.

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:50.120
Chris keeps telling Rose to get the keys.

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:53.340
Missy and Dean tell Chris that they don't
want him to leave.

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:57.910
Chris asks for the keys again, and Rose says,
very calmly while holding them in her hand:

00:07:57.910 --> 00:08:00.080
"You know I can't give you the keys."

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:04.050
Chris finally realizes that Rose also is in
on whatever this is.

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:05.540
Jeremy attacks Chris.

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:10.190
Missy clinks the teaspoon on her glass, causing
Chris to sink back into the void again.

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:12.770
The Armitage family drag him to the basement.

00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:16.630
Rod keeps trying to call Chris, but it's going
straight to voicemail.

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:20.090
He looks up the guy’s picture Chris sent
him and sees that he went missing half a year

00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:21.090
ago.

00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:25.390
Rod goes to the police, explaining his theory
of some white folks brainwashing black people

00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:27.350
and making them their slaves.

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:29.050
Police burst out laughing.

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:31.360
Nobody takes him seriously.

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:34.991
Chris wakes up to find himself strapped to
a chair in front of a mounted deer head and

00:08:34.991 --> 00:08:36.479
an old TV set.

00:08:36.479 --> 00:08:40.550
He watches a video made by Dean's father that
talks about immortality.

00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:44.550
The teacup and spoon appear on the screen,
and he blacks out again.

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:47.560
Rod tries Chris's phone again and Rose answers.

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:52.050
She lies by saying that Chris left two days
ago and she's concerned about his whereabouts.

00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:55.560
Rod tells her that he went to the police and
Rose seems concerned.

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:59.900
Rod starts to realize something is wrong,
so he tries to record the call, but when he

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:04.060
starts talking to her again, she tells him
she knows he has the hots for her.

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:06.710
He tells her she's crazy and hangs up.

00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:08.980
Chris wakes up and Jim is on the screen.

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:11.490
He tells Chris that they're going to swap
brains.

00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:15.480
The other people at the party were all about
being black, but Jim couldn't care less about

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:16.480
that.

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:20.080
What he really wants is to be able to see
the world through Chris's eyes.

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:23.200
Dean has perfected the neurosurgery to make
this all possible.

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:27.040
And Missy hypnotizes the body donors to prepare
them for the procedure.

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:31.610
He will continue existing in the void but
will be able to continue as sort of a "passenger."

00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:35.930
The flashing is an unfortunate side effect,
as they saw earlier at the party.

00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:38.920
With a ting of the teaspoon - Chris is out.

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:42.340
Dean and Jeremy prepare Jim for a brain transplant.

00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:43.890
Jeremy goes to get Chris.

00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:45.520
He is unconscious.

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:49.520
Jeremy takes off his restraints, and as he
is getting infusion ready, Chris smashes his

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:51.810
head with a ball, knocking him out.

00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:55.950
Chris stuffed padding from the chair in his
ears to block the sound of the teaspoon.

00:09:55.950 --> 00:09:59.500
Dean calls for Jeremy and goes out of the
lab area to look for him.

00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:03.180
Chris rushes him and impales him with the
deer antlers from the other room.

00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:06.720
He knocks over a candle that ignites the blanket
covering Jim.

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:09.060
Chris goes upstairs and finds Missy.

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:13.590
She goes for the teacup and spoon, but Chris
beats her to them and smashes the cup.

00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:18.080
Instead she attacks him with a knife, impaling
his palm, he turns the blade in his hand and

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:19.770
stabs her to death.

00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:24.000
Chris goes for the front door, but Jeremy
jumps him and puts him in a chokehold.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.270
As Jeremy kicks the door, Chris stabs him
in the leg, breaks his skull with brutal head

00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:30.750
stomps, and takes his keys.

00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:34.170
Rose has earbuds in and isn't aware any of
this is going on.

00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:37.960
While she listens to music, she is googling
images of handsome-looking black men with

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:39.760
good physiques.

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:42.630
Chris runs outside and gets into Jeremy's
car.

00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:45.130
He starts driving but hits Georgina.

00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:47.220
Rose hears this through her earbuds.

00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:51.230
He can't just let Georgina lie there, so he
gets her in the car and continues down the

00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:52.520
driveway.

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:55.480
Rose gets out of the house with a gun and
whispers “grandma”.

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:57.740
Georgina wakes up and attacks him.

00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:02.330
In the process, her wig falls off and he sees
she has a scar across her head from a brain

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:03.470
transplant.

00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:05.750
They crash into a tree and she dies.

00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:09.230
Suddenly, the rearview mirror is blown away.

00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:11.700
Rose is coming after Chris with a rifle.

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:16.640
From out of nowhere, Walter runs past Rose
to pursue Chris, and Rose says, "Get him,

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:18.310
Grandpa," as he tackles Chris.

00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:21.620
They wrestle on the ground, and Chris takes
his picture.

00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:22.650
Flash!

00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:25.460
Walter turns and asks Rose for her rifle.

00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:30.370
She gives it to him, and he shoots her in
the stomach before turning the rifle on himself.

00:11:30.370 --> 00:11:32.360
Rose is on the ground bleeding out.

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:35.750
She puts a hand on his cheek and tells Chris
that she loves him.

00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:37.510
Chris starts to choke Rose but stops.

00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:40.310
A police car pulls up.

00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:44.080
Rose calls weakly for help, knowing how it
looks and that Chris will be held responsible

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:45.430
for everything.

00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:48.030
But it's Rod stepping out of the police car.

00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:49.500
Chris gets into the car.

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:53.920
Rod looks at the chaos and says, "Man, I told
you not to go in that house."

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:54.920
The end.

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:56.560
Thank you for watching!
