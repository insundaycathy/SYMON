00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.310
Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:05.930
Today, I'm going to explain a crime, drama,
and thriller film called "Frailty."

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:07.140
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.960
Watch out and take care.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.679
Agent Wesley Doyle enters an F.B.I building,
passing an ambulance on his way in.

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.880
He makes his way up, and another agent, Griff,
tells him that a man carrying information

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.350
about a case Wesley is working on has arrived.

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:23.170
Wesley enters his office and greets the man
with a handshake.

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.670
The man reciprocates by handing Wesley a picture
of Wesley and his mother.

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.019
Wesley finds it odd that the man was poking
around on his desk, but the man says he has

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:33.340
been waiting for a while, saying he’s been
through Wesley’s plaques and citations,

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.150
as well as crime scene photos.

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.800
The man introduces himself as Fenton Meiks
and reveals that he believes his brother Adam

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.629
is the God’s hand killer.

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:44.200
Fenton begins narrating the events of the
previous night.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.649
Fenton got a call from Adam.

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:48.809
The latter said that demons were taking over
the world, and he could no longer defeat them

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.199
by himself.

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:53.539
Fenton tried to calm Adam down, but Adam said
he needed Fenton to take him back to the rose

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:55.590
garden as Fenton had promised.

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.130
Adam then hanged up, headed to his study,
and shot himself in the head.

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.449
Back in the office, Wesley takes note of everything
Fenton says.

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:04.730
Fenton admits that he buried Adam in the rose
garden.

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.120
Wesley still doesn't think that Adam is the
God's Hand killer as Adam has never explicitly

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.240
said it.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.540
Fenton says that there is a lot more to uncover
and that Wesley will fully understand everything

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.770
by the end of it.

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.570
Wesley calls the sheriff’s office, asking
if they know a man named Fenton Meiks.

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.370
The woman on the other line says Fenton was
present earlier.

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.110
He had apparently stolen an ambulance and
Adam’s body.

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.050
Wesley returns to the room and asks what Fenton
knows.

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.620
Fenton changes the subject, pointing to Wesley’s
photo, telling him that Wesley and his mother

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.020
have the same eyes.

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.180
Feeling frustrated, Wesley again asks what
makes Fenton think his brother is the God's

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:35.490
Hand killer.

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.321
Fenton tells another story of how everything
started in Thurman when he and his brother

00:01:38.321 --> 00:01:40.510
were still young and living with their father.

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.330
The year was 1979.

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.990
A school bus dropped off a young Fenton and
Adam, and they made their way to a place called

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.090
Thurman Rose Garden.

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.330
Behind the garden was their home.

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.720
Fenton reveals that their mother died at childbirth
when she was in labor with Adam.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.300
Due to their mother’s passing, Adam became
Fenton’s responsibility while their father,

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.780
Mr. Meiks, worked as a mechanic.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.720
They lay in their beds, waiting for their
father to tuck them in.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.030
Mr. Meiks comes in and bonds with them for
a while before kissing them good night.

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.880
Fenton stayed awake, looking at the light
in the ceiling, thinking things someone his

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.250
age shouldn't have to.

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.750
Suddenly, the bulb turned on, their father
came into the room and announced that he had

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.000
something to say.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.130
He had a vision from God earlier that night.

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.300
He saw an angel in the form of a bright light
that talked to him about God's special purpose

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.530
for his family.

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.660
He told Fenton and Adam that the world was
ending.

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.730
There’s a war between angels and demons,
and they're the only ones that knew of it.

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.130
Adam voiced out that he's scared, and while
their father comforted him, Fenton silently

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:31.130
judged.

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.200
The angel bestowed upon them the title of
God's hand, and they're tasked to destroy

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.200
demons.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.660
Fenton's reaction indicated that he didn't
believe and spoke out, saying none of it makes

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:39.660
sense.

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.440
Their father further romanticized this idea
of becoming superheroes destined to save the

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:43.850
world from demons.

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.180
They'll be blessed with three magical weapons
to help in killing the demons.

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.070
Adam was quickly captivated, while Fenton
remained doubtful.

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.040
Later, Fenton sat overwhelmed, tightly hugging
his pillow, bracing for impact as his happy

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.280
world turned upside down in a single night.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.420
He felt alone, and the sinister stares of
his family cornered him to this dark state

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:00.620
in his life.

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.610
This haunted him for the following days.

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.710
On his way to work, Mr. Meiks had another
encounter with God.

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:08.010
He saw a ray of light that shined on a barn.

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.710
He made his way in and saw a pair of gloves
and an ax buried on a tree stump.

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:14.810
Days pass and Mr. Meiks brings the last of
the magical weapons.

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.100
He said it's only a matter of time before
the extermination begins, as they would soon

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.750
receive the first list of names.

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.910
While at work, Mr. Meiks checked the undercarriage
of the car.

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.210
He hallucinated, and everything around him
morphed into a cathedral.

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:28.610
An angel wielding a sword on fire approached
him.

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:31.280
He came to his senses and started writing
on a notepad.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.850
The night arrived, Fenton and his father talked
about the mission God gave them.

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.210
As a final attempt to sway his father, Fenton
suggested that maybe all of this was just

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:40.800
a dream and that there was something wrong
inside his head.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.450
Mr. Meiks disagreed and brought out the list
of names.

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.020
At that moment, Fenton finally accepted that
this was his new reality.

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:50.020
Adam approached his father, saying that God
gave him a list as well.

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:53.430
Mr. Meiks read out the name of Adam's bully;
he made Adam tell the truth and taught him

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.450
a lesson about not making things up.

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.700
The frustration in Fenton's eyes was evident
as he's the only one that noticed the irony

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.290
behind all of this.

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.140
Fenton stood near the sheriff's station.

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.250
He felt conflicted because he was close to
waking his family up from the nightmare they're

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:06.250
in.

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.370
However, he chose to run from the responsibility
of putting his father into prison.

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.580
Late at night, the brothers lay down on their
beds, and they talk about their’s fathers

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:14.180
obsession with demons.

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.989
Fenton said it's all make-believe, but Adam
disagrees.

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:19.730
Fenton tried his best to persuade Adam to
run away with him.

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:23.240
Adam smiled at his brother's proposition,
and the conversation ended.

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.169
Fenton woke up in the middle of the night
and saw his father carrying a body bag over

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:27.260
his shoulders.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.490
His bloody father brought home a tied-up woman.

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.540
He invited the two inside the shed to witness
what he was about to do.

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.639
The woman was filled with fear and confusion.

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:38.070
Mr. Meiks gets the ax, and Fenton pleaded
for his father to stop.

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:40.870
However, he was determined to act out the
will of God.

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.639
Mr. Meiks grabbed the woman’s arm and felt
the demon hiding beneath the human facade.

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:47.410
He swung the ax and murdered the woman in
front of his children.

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:50.960
Mr. Meiks and Adam worked together to bury
their victim while Fenton cried.

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.080
Mr. Meiks comforted Fenton by saying that
he would start to understand everything when

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.710
they hunt down more demons.

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:59.670
In the present day, Wesley asks where Fenton's
father is, to which he replies that he's long

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:00.670
dead.

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:03.350
Fenton says that his father believes he’s
liberating the world from the demons and not

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:04.820
committing murder.

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:08.570
Fenton admits that he didn't tell on his father
because he was still a child and was terrified.

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:11.770
To further prove that Adam is the God's Hand
killer, he reveals that he knows where the

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:12.970
bodies are.

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:15.760
Wesley cuffs Fenton before they ride off to
the rose garden.

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.900
They converse more in the vehicle, talking
about how one can carry that heavy a secret

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.310
for so long.

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:23.900
Fenton changes the topic and again brings
up the picture of Wesley and his mom.

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:27.490
This time around, Wesley opens up to Fenton,
saying that a few days after that picture

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.620
was taken, his mom was murdered.

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:34.060
They never found the killer, and Fenton hypothesizes
that this is why Wesley took on the case.

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:38.030
Wesley gets tired of getting questioned and
asks Fenton why he keeps changing the subject,

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:39.419
accusing him of hiding something.

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:41.699
A month passed since the night of the first
murder.

00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:45.050
The brothers acted like normal children again,
but no amount of time could fade the stain

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:46.340
on their innocence.

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:49.050
They entered the house and asked about the
parked van outside.

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:52.520
Their father said they need it for hunting
demons while holding the dreaded notepad.

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.310
They waited outside a store to abduct their
next victim.

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:58.550
Fenton argued that it's too risky to do this
in broad daylight, but Mr. Meiks said God

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:00.850
would blind anyone from seeing what they would
do.

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:04.440
The man exited the store, and they initiated
the plan despite Fenton not wanting to do

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:05.440
so.

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:08.730
Fenton acted out a scene remarkably well,
convincing the man that his imaginary dog

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:10.370
was stuck underneath the car.

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:13.180
The man kneeled, and Mr. Meiks struck him
from behind.

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:16.520
They took him to the shed, where Mr. Meiks
touched the man, and appears to have a vision

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:17.540
of the man’s sins.

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:19.370
He then takes the man’s life.

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:21.800
Fenton revisited the idea of running away
with Adam.

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:25.760
However, Adam still refused, justifying his
father's murders by bestowing him the title

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:27.320
of a demon slayer.

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:30.139
Adam left Fenton and planned to snitch on
Fenton to their father.

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:33.090
Mr. Meiks entered the boys’ room, only waking
Fenton up.

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:35.740
He confronted Fenton about what he and Adam
talked about.

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:38.550
His father invited him outside to try and
change his mind.

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:41.700
He commanded him to dig a hole and expects
him to be done halfway by the time he gets

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:42.700
home.

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:45.580
Fenton argued that's not possible, and his
father said that anything’s possible with

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:46.580
God.

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:48.479
He dug the hole by his own sheer will.

00:06:48.479 --> 00:06:51.810
He despised God and the angels because of
what they did to his father.

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:54.880
Adam gave him a glass of water as he made
good progress with the hole.

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:57.660
The two talked for a while, and they end up
fighting.

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:01.120
Fenton stood there all sweaty and tired, worried
about his brainwashed brother.

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:04.380
This went on for five more days until the
hole became as deep as Fenton's hatred for

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:05.380
God.

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:08.580
In the following days, they constructed a
dungeon underneath the shed.

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:11.980
Fenton still acted coldly even after the time
they spent together working.

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:14.050
Another person became their unfortunate victim.

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:17.970
However, this time, Mr. Meiks instructed Fenton
to kill him.

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:20.250
Fenton ran away and arrived at the sheriff's
station.

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:23.240
The station is unattended, so he ran to the
sheriff’s house.

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.820
He told his story, but the sheriff didn’t
believe him.

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:29.450
As he was about to call Fenton's father, Fenton
shouted out that he had proof.

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:31.500
Mr. Meiks invited the sheriff inside.

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:34.420
His father apologized for the trouble Fenton
had caused.

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:37.290
Mr. Meiks convincingly made up lies to remove
any suspicion.

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:41.020
However, being this close to putting a stop
to his father's murders, Fenton pleaded for

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:42.900
the sheriff to at least check the shed.

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:45.600
His father agreed and looked menacingly in
Fenton's way.

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:49.650
They opened the shed, and Fenton and the sheriff
made their way down the cellar finding nothing.

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:52.520
The sheriff looked at him disappointed and
climbed up the stairs.

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:56.960
Suddenly, Fenton heard an ax hitting flesh,
and down came the sheriff, all bloody and

00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:57.960
disoriented.

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:00.930
His father sinisterly stepped down and swung
his ax, killing his first victim that's not

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:02.020
on the list.

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:03.400
He felt sick and puked.

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:06.590
Mr. Meiks' head was all sorts of messed up
as he claimed that this is the first innocent

00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:07.590
man he had killed.

00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:09.900
He even blamed Fenton for it.

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:14.100
Fenton called him crazy, and the rage built
up inside his father almost cost him his life.

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:16.340
Luckily, Adam stopped him just in time.

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:19.680
The two cry while an unfazed Fenton looked
at his father with disgust.

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:21.800
Mr. Meiks invited Fenton to the shed.

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:24.550
He commanded Fenton to come in and shut the
door behind him.

00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:27.560
He asked Fenton if he's afraid of him, and
he nodded in agreement.

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:30.669
His father said that the angel told him that
Fenton's a demon, but he didn’t believe

00:08:30.669 --> 00:08:31.669
it.

00:08:31.669 --> 00:08:34.979
Mr. Meiks stated that his love for Fenton
is even greater than that of his faith.

00:08:34.979 --> 00:08:38.769
His father then said he's the one that's afraid
of Fenton and opened the cellar hatch.

00:08:38.769 --> 00:08:41.490
Fenton tried to escape, but he got overpowered
easily.

00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:43.679
He left him there and nailed down the hatch.

00:08:43.679 --> 00:08:45.589
Adam entered the shed to wake Fenton up.

00:08:45.589 --> 00:08:49.779
He pleaded for Adam to help him, but his loyalty
to his deranged dad was steadfast.

00:08:49.779 --> 00:08:53.070
Adam said he'll probably be out of there in
a week, leaving a furious Fenton banging on

00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:54.070
the hatch.

00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:58.180
On the seventh day, Mr. Meiks opened the hatch
and asked Fenton if he had spoken to God.

00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:01.100
Fenton's fortitude remained strong as he replied
that there’s no God.

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:03.019
His father locked him in again.

00:09:03.019 --> 00:09:06.829
Time passed, Fenton finally saw a vision from
God, and there he realized what his mission

00:09:06.829 --> 00:09:07.829
was.

00:09:07.829 --> 00:09:09.769
One day, Fenton stopped answering.

00:09:09.769 --> 00:09:12.790
He was unconscious on the steps and got carried
out by his father.

00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:15.709
He gained consciousness and told his father
that he spoke to God.

00:09:15.709 --> 00:09:19.029
Mr. Meiks felt relieved to see his son finally
accepting God's will.

00:09:19.029 --> 00:09:22.779
They apologized to one another and talked
about plans to catch Fenton's first demon.

00:09:22.779 --> 00:09:24.519
The night of the abduction came.

00:09:24.519 --> 00:09:27.429
The two approached their victim’s home,
and Mr. Meiks knocked on the door.

00:09:27.429 --> 00:09:31.779
They asked for a spare tire, but their conversation
got interrupted by the man's wife; he angrily

00:09:31.779 --> 00:09:33.029
cusses her out.

00:09:33.029 --> 00:09:35.839
They followed him to his garage to retrieve
a spare tire.

00:09:35.839 --> 00:09:39.129
Just as his father was about to hit the man,
the man realized what they're doing and struck

00:09:39.129 --> 00:09:40.129
first.

00:09:40.129 --> 00:09:43.699
However, Fenton came to the rescue and hit
the man, allowing his father to knock him

00:09:43.699 --> 00:09:44.699
out.

00:09:44.699 --> 00:09:48.269
At the cellar, Fenton had the ax in his hand
and shared a sentimental moment with his father.

00:09:48.269 --> 00:09:51.569
Mr. Meiks touched the demon and commanded
Fenton to destroy him.

00:09:51.569 --> 00:09:55.850
Fenton lifted the ax, and at the apex of the
swing, he aimed it toward his father's chest.

00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:57.660
Adam rushed to help his dying father.

00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:00.320
He whispered in Adam's ears with his final
breath.

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:02.589
Fenton removed the duct tape from the man's
mouth.

00:10:02.589 --> 00:10:05.459
The man screamed as Adam rushed to finish
him off with an ax.

00:10:05.459 --> 00:10:09.089
Back in the present, Fenton becomes emotional
as he remembers that dreadful day.

00:10:09.089 --> 00:10:11.759
Wesley is the first person he has spoken to
about this.

00:10:11.759 --> 00:10:15.779
They sit in complete silence as Fenton doesn't
want to continue the conversation anymore.

00:10:15.779 --> 00:10:19.570
They arrive at their destination, and Fenton
leads him to where the bodies are located.

00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:22.860
He recoups his calm manner and continues to
share about what happened next during that

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:23.860
night.

00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:26.879
Fenton dug up a ditch and asked Adam to promise
that if he ever kills him, he'll bury him

00:10:26.879 --> 00:10:28.000
in the garden.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.029
Wesley is puzzled; he says it doesn't make
sense as Adam is the one that Fenton buried.

00:10:32.029 --> 00:10:34.749
To his surprise, Fenton reveals himself to
be Adam Meiks.

00:10:34.749 --> 00:10:38.769
He says to Wesley that he'll understand everything
soon enough and leads him to where he buried

00:10:38.769 --> 00:10:39.769
Fenton.

00:10:39.769 --> 00:10:42.879
They arrive at the spot, and Adam kneels to
reminisce about how his father failed to destroy

00:10:42.879 --> 00:10:44.570
the demon that is his brother.

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:48.029
This is why he took the responsibility to
hunt Fenton down himself.

00:10:48.029 --> 00:10:51.529
Fenton took on the alias God’s Hand because
he knew this would catch Adam’s attention.

00:10:51.529 --> 00:10:54.110
He left him notes through his victims, eventually
leading Adam to him.

00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:57.619
It is revealed that Adam entered Fenton's
unlocked home, and Fenton sat as he waited

00:10:57.619 --> 00:10:58.619
for him.

00:10:58.619 --> 00:11:01.249
He uttered Adam's name, prepared to meet his
fate.

00:11:01.249 --> 00:11:04.480
Adam shares to Wesley that he believes everything
his father has ever told them.

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:08.050
He sees the same visions and the actual demons
that reside in the human shell.

00:11:08.050 --> 00:11:10.730
Wesley points a gun at Adam, but he doesn’t
flinch.

00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:14.519
Instead, he taunts Wesley by saying that catching
him won't bring his mother back.

00:11:14.519 --> 00:11:16.920
Wesley attacks Adam but gets overpowered.

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:20.429
Adam gets a hold of him, and Adam sees a vision
of Wesley murdering his mother.

00:11:20.429 --> 00:11:22.980
He then whispers to Wesley that he is on his
list.

00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:26.089
Adam proceeds to uncuff himself and carries
Wesley into his ditch.

00:11:26.089 --> 00:11:29.230
He grabs hold of his trusted ax, crossing
another name off his list.

00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:33.759
Back at the office, the investigation begins,
and officers interrogate Griff about Adam.

00:11:33.759 --> 00:11:36.709
However, Griff seems to have forgotten Adam’s
face.

00:11:36.709 --> 00:11:39.689
All the surveillance footage has problems,
and the only trace they have of Adam is the

00:11:39.689 --> 00:11:41.920
name he gave them, which is Fenton Meiks.

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:45.399
F.B.I. enters the Fenton's home, and Griff
sees a list pinned on the board with Wesley

00:11:45.399 --> 00:11:46.959
Doyle's name crossed out.

00:11:46.959 --> 00:11:49.869
Griff walks into the sheriff's station, and
a woman greets him.

00:11:49.869 --> 00:11:52.949
He asks for the sheriff, and the sheriff is
revealed to be Adam.

00:11:52.949 --> 00:12:04.779
Griff doesn't seem to remember him at all
and proceeds to ask questions about Fenton.
