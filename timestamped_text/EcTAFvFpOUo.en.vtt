Ahead, watch out and take care.&nbsp;

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:17.280
The movie starts with Laura Burney, a&nbsp;
charming woman enjoying her time on the beach,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.560
and her husband Martin Burney, a&nbsp;
successful investment counselor in Boston.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:28.640
They seem like a perfect couple; she is gorgeous,&nbsp;
and he is handsome. They live in his summer house;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:34.480
Laura is getting ready for a social gathering.&nbsp;
Upon arrival, they don’t spend long enough in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:40.000
party and their eyes lock again, they definitely&nbsp;
have a chemistry going on. He then takes her back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.400
to home, he is fond of listening to Berlioz&nbsp;
Symphony Fantastique, which sounds like this&nbsp;

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.120
The next day, martin is working out,&nbsp;
maybe last night’s workout wasn’t enough.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:58.080
He then notices misplaced towels in&nbsp;
the washroom, he then brings Laura&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.800
there, and he reminds her not to do the&nbsp;
mistake again. Afraid from consequences,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.880
she then aligns the canned goods in the cabinet&nbsp;
with utmost accuracy, the way martin likes it. She&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.080
then tells him about the menu for the supper, and&nbsp;
he then leaves. Later, he meets their neighbour,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.560
the neighbour tells him that his wife is&nbsp;
gorgeous, and he keeps looking at her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.720
then they talk about sailing, and how much martin&nbsp;
is fond of sailing and passionate about it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.200
Then the neighbour gives him an invitation&nbsp;
for sailing together but he denies it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:33.680
by saying his wife Laura is afraid of water and&nbsp;
she cannot even swim or go near the water. Later,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.240
Martin gets home, and he is not happy that the&nbsp;
neighbour is having pleasure in seeing his wife,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.720
so he starts beating her, and he kicks her.&nbsp;
Strangely he apologizes quickly, and then he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.360
tells her about the invitation from the neighbour&nbsp;
for sailing that week. He assures her that he will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:56.000
be next to her, and then he leaves while Laura is&nbsp;
in agonizing pain. At this point we can say that,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.880
Martin is an obsessive and controlling person&nbsp;
who has physically and emotionally abused Laura.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.360
Outside, she notices light bulbs,&nbsp;
and she starts taking them down.&nbsp;

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.800
Later that night, Martin returns&nbsp;
to home, and he apologizes again,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:17.120
and he showers her with flowers, then he gives&nbsp;
her a red dress, his favourite color. He then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.440
undresses her and makes her wear that dress;&nbsp;
it seems clear that she is not comfortable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:27.280
with this treatment, and she does not like it.&nbsp;
Sooner, he forces himself on her, and her face&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.800
says everything by now. The next day, they talk&nbsp;
about Laura wanting to do a job in a library,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.080
but she is not allowed to do anything. She&nbsp;
then mentions how she wasn’t even allowed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.960
to visit her mom’s funeral six months ago,&nbsp;
Martin speculates that she is bringing it up,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:48.240
so they get into an argument and cancel the plan&nbsp;
to sail that night. He then tells her that they’ll&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.720
always be together, and nothing can break them&nbsp;
apart, then they get ready to go for sailing.&nbsp;

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.320
Later that night, the weather starts getting&nbsp;
severe and the neighbour assures Laura that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:03.840
nothing will happen, Martin looks at them in a&nbsp;
creepy way. Then the weather gets worse and worse,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:10.720
Laura seems scared and nervous from her fears&nbsp;
of water. Unexpectedly the boat jib opens up,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.840
and both Martin and the neighbour try to&nbsp;
fix it, but the winds are too harsh. Sooner,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:21.120
Martin rolls out of the boat and the neighbour&nbsp;
gets him back. However, Laura is missing, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:27.120
she fell into the water, Martin starts freaking&nbsp;
out since he knows she cannot swim. After an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:32.400
extensive Coast Guard search, they find the safety&nbsp;
vest of Laura, suggesting Laura couldn’t survive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:38.000
the waters. Martin returns home, and he is raging&nbsp;
out and blaming himself for the Loss of his wife.&nbsp;

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:47.360
Few days later, a funeral procession take place,&nbsp;
and Laura is finally gone, a truly sad moment for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:53.040
Martin, and he is in disbelief. However, in&nbsp;
the flashback, Laura swam through the water,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:53.600 --> 00:04:02.880
and she survived the storm, and she says. At this&nbsp;
point, we can say that she had it all planned,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.280
her UNO reverse card was saved till this&nbsp;
moment to save herself from the beginning.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:12.160
Then she goes back to Martin’s house, she&nbsp;
grabs a bag that she had already prepared,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:17.200
she then cuts her hair, and out of rage, she&nbsp;
takes her ring out and she dumps it in toilet.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:25.120
She then leaves the place for good. Laura is in&nbsp;
the bus to Cedar Falls, Iowa. An old lady offers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.840
her some fruit, then they talk a bit, and Laura&nbsp;
reveals that she is going to see her mom, and her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.720
mom is alive, so earlier when she mentioned&nbsp;
that her mom is dead, it was a lie as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.840
She then tells her the story about her abusive&nbsp;
husband, and how she was trapped in the house,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:45.280
and that she faked her own death. She explains&nbsp;
further that she stayed with him for 3 years.

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.840
The greyhound bus brings her to Iowa, and she can&nbsp;
be seen smiling again, as if she was just released&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:57.520
from a prison, enjoying the little things, and&nbsp;
embracing the life. She then rents a house as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:04.080
Sara Waters. Her house rent is 700 dollars,&nbsp;
and she takes it. She then starts organizing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.720
the house and coloring it. She looks at the&nbsp;
sunset and cherishes everything she lost.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:13.600
She takes a shower, and after the&nbsp;
shower, she misplaces the towels,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:20.800
as her sign of freedom. A young man, Ben Woodward,&nbsp;
is outside in the lawn. He is her neighbour, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:26.720
she smiles while looking at him. Back in Martin’s&nbsp;
house, he walks on the shore, and a broken piece&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:32.480
of the lightbulb gets into his feet. He realizes&nbsp;
that they all have been broken. At Laura’s home,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:38.480
she goes outside, and she starts collecting apples&nbsp;
from the yard, Ben shows up and tells her that she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:44.240
can be arrested for stealing. He then says we can&nbsp;
make a deal and she replies, I don’t make deals.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:50.160
Then he comes back to her, and he brings the&nbsp;
apples, and he apologizes, that he didn’t mean&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:55.600
to scare her. He introduces himself and he tells&nbsp;
her that he is a drama teacher at a local college.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:01.360
He wants to know her name, but she wants&nbsp;
him to leave. He asks her for a date,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:06.960
and he leaves. Martin is at work, and he&nbsp;
gets a call from a lady working at YWCA.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.760
She mentions Laura and gives her condolences,&nbsp;
Martin is shocked since Laura never went to YWCA.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:19.040
The lady then reveals that she came there every&nbsp;
morning to take swimming lessons and she became&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:25.440
a very good swimmer. Upon hearing, that Martin&nbsp;
gets out of control. He then drives back to home,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000
and he starts going through her belongings&nbsp;
for hours, he gets a cut while going through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.640
the stuff, and he notices the wedding ring she&nbsp;
dumped earlier, which failed to flush in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:40.320
toilet. He takes it out and he realizes she&nbsp;
might be alive, and she faked her own death.&nbsp;

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:45.280
Laura goes to Ben’s house with the&nbsp;
apple pie she made from his apples.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:51.120
He asks her to play some music while they eat&nbsp;
dinner, she says play any music except Berlioz&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:56.800
Symphony Fantastique, the song that Martin used to&nbsp;
play. He found out that she is looking for a job,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:02.800
and he suggests that he can get her some work, but&nbsp;
she denies it. He then notices a wound on Laura’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:08.320
head, he suspects that she had a troubled past.&nbsp;
She then gives him her new name, Sara Waters.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:14.960
The next day, Martin starts investigating further&nbsp;
about Laura. He goes to a retirement home where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:20.400
Laura’s mother used to live. After talking a bit,&nbsp;
it is revealed that Laura took her mother out of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:26.400
there 6 months ago. Ben helps Laura to get a job&nbsp;
in library, he asks her what her real name is?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:33.600
Since when he calls her name as Sara, she is not&nbsp;
affected. He expresses that he likes her, she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:39.280
denies it and heartbroken Ben leaves. Later, she&nbsp;
calls her mom from a phonebooth to hear her voice.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:45.120
Martin hires a private investigator, and he&nbsp;
offers him 20,000 dollars if he finds her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:51.200
Few days later, the whole town is celebrating&nbsp;
The Independence Day, Ben notices Laura in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:56.800
celebration, he reaches out to her, and they both&nbsp;
are happy to see each other. He apologizes about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:01.760
the other day, but she says we are good. Then&nbsp;
they talk a bit about their personal lives,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:05.840
and Laura reveals that she misses her mom,&nbsp;
and she didn’t see her in the last 6 months.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:12.800
Chloe, mother of Laura is in a nursing home.&nbsp;
Martin located her and he is standing next to her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:18.000
Laura is at home, she hears a knock on the&nbsp;
door, and Ben invites her to a special place.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:22.960
He takes her to a stage, and he showers her&nbsp;
with his love, and he sings a song for her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:29.120
They both have a lot of fun, and they both&nbsp;
are clearly in Love. They both start dancing,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:37.200
they get back to home, and they both start&nbsp;
kissing each other, and almost have a hormone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:42.560
sandwich on the stairs. She resists and she&nbsp;
pushes him away, and she wants him to leave.&nbsp;

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:50.560
The next day, Ben is sad, and disappointed from&nbsp;
being rejected again and again. Laura goes to him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:55.120
and she tells him about her ex-husband that he&nbsp;
was abusive, and she had to escape from him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:55.120 --> 00:09:00.560
he assures her nothing will happen to her. Later,&nbsp;
he helps her in disguising herself as a man,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:05.920
and then she goes to the nursing home. She goes&nbsp;
to her Blind mother Chloe, and she starts singing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:11.280
her a lullaby that her mom used to sing for her,&nbsp;
she then reveals to her that she left Martin, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:17.120
she tells her about Ben as well. Chloe assures her&nbsp;
to be strong and not to let anyone harm her again.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:21.840
Martin is in the same nursing home,&nbsp;
and he is inquiring about Laura.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:26.800
Then he prepares to leave from there and Laura is&nbsp;
drinking water from the fountain, and she leaves.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:32.320
A lady tells him about the visitor that they&nbsp;
had today, and he runs outside to look for her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:39.280
She gets home, and she is filled with joy, and&nbsp;
she jumps in Ben’s arms. Martin goes to Chloe,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:44.160
posing as a private detective, and he tells her&nbsp;
that Martin is in the town, and they need to find&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:49.200
Laura to warn her. She don’t know where to find&nbsp;
her, but she tells him about Ben and the college&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:55.200
he teaches. He is about to kill her brutally,&nbsp;
but he is interrupted by a nurse, and he leaves.&nbsp;

00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:01.920
The next day, he goes to the college, and he&nbsp;
abducts a professor, but he learns it’s not the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:08.800
right person. Ben is teaching his students in the&nbsp;
college; he then spies on him. Later that night,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:14.480
he follows them, and he sees Ben and Laura happy,&nbsp;
and he is in shock and jealousy has taken over&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:19.520
his mind. At this point, we can say that if&nbsp;
he can beat his wife, because the neighbour&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:23.520
was looking at her, then what he will do when he&nbsp;
found her kissing a man and faking her own death.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:28.480
Laura and Ben get back to home,&nbsp;
she is taking a bath and relaxing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:34.320
However, she notices the aligned towels and&nbsp;
she jumps out, she then starts checking the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:40.320
house nervously, after checking the house, she&nbsp;
finds the kitchen towels aligned as well. She&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:44.880
opens the kitchen cabinets, and she is happy&nbsp;
to see it messy, she then walks from there,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:48.640
and she notices an open window and&nbsp;
Ben is seen walking in the house.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:54.640
She is clearly scared, then they both have dinner&nbsp;
outside, and he gives her a kiss before leaving.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:59.840
She goes in the house, and she plays&nbsp;
music, it plays Martin’s favourite song,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:03.680
she then notices that the closet&nbsp;
is open and fire alarm goes on,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:07.600
she breaks it because I think pressing&nbsp;
a button would be too hard for hwe.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:14.000
She then goes to the kitchen cabinets, and she&nbsp;
finds them rearranged to Martin’s exact standards.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.320
She cries and laughs in a disappointing accepting&nbsp;
manner, knowing her fears have come true and her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:24.000
husband chased her till there. He then shows&nbsp;
up and gives her a kiss, Ben knocks the door,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:30.720
he then reminds her the time to meet tomorrow.&nbsp;
Soon after closing the door, Ben breaks the door,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:37.920
and he attacks Martin. However, he overpowers him.&nbsp;
Martin then shows her the wedding ring, then Laura&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:43.360
knees him in his Marbles, making him drop the gun.&nbsp;
She grabs Martin’s gun and holds him at gunpoint.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:47.680
Martin says that even police won’t be&nbsp;
able to protect her, and he loves her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:53.040
She calls the police, by informing them that she&nbsp;
killed an intruder, and then she shoots Martin.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:56.640
She shoots him three times, and&nbsp;
then he falls to the ground.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:02.720
Only to wake up as zombie and he tries to shoot&nbsp;
her, but the gun is empty. Martin finally dies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:07.840
from his wounds, while Laura goes to Ben and they&nbsp;
hug each other, while waiting for the police,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:14.320
