00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.280
Hi, Mystery Recapped here.

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.339
Today, I'm going to explain a horror-thriller
film called "Walled In."

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:07.720
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.314
Watch out and take care!

00:00:13.109 --> 00:00:16.650
The movie begins with a young girl trapped
in between walls.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.560
Not long after, cement begins pouring down
on her from all angles.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.180
The little girl cannot go anywhere else; she
is buried alive.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.140
The scene moves to 15 years later.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.509
A young engineer, Sam, has just graduated
from college.

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:35.200
At her graduation party, her father, an owner
of a demolition company, gives her a gift:

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.860
a job supervising the demolition of a building
in the middle of nowhere.

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.300
If she's successful, she will become his partner.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.791
Her first assignment happens to be this gigantic
unique architectural structure (an apartment

00:00:46.791 --> 00:00:49.660
building) located out in the middle of nowhere.

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.160
The structure is the product of Joseph Malestrazza,
who was an eccentric architect obsessed with

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.020
Egyptian architecture.

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:00.880
Samantha arrives at the Malestrazza building
and is greeted by Mary, the caretaker.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.370
She lives with her son, Jimmy, who is a loner
kid.

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:08.060
Sam tells Mary she will be staying in one
of the apartments in the building.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.010
Jimmy takes her bags to her apartment and
explains the rules of the building.

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.600
She is to stay off the eighth floor because
it is Malestrazza's and the roof because it

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.130
is too dangerous.

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.990
As she is walking to her room, she sees a
room labeled as Julie's.

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.210
She then enters her room, and immediately
takes a bath to clean herself up.

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:30.140
Later that day, she meets Mary and asks her,
how many people still live in this apartment?

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.939
Mary replies that only four people live in
it.

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.999
Mary and Jimmy are in the building to look
after it until its day of destruction.

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:40.650
All the other tenants have been evicted, but
two have refused to leave.

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.619
The next day, Sam prepares to analyze the
structure of the building.

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:48.350
Sam is in charge of providing a report on
how much T.N.T is needed to knock down this

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.499
building; she must determine the best rupture
points and type of explosives.

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:56.859
A few hours later, she goes to a minimarket
to buy some food and drinks.

00:01:56.859 --> 00:02:01.590
Out of curiosity, she borrows a computer to
browse the history of the apartment building.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.909
She discovers that in 1993, there were a series
of missing people.

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.630
When they were finally found, it was horrific.

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:14.250
Sixteen people, men, women, and children,
were sealed in small compartments in the building,

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.690
which were then filled with liquid concrete.

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.440
One of the victims was the architect himself-
Malestrazza.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.830
A construction worker was initially blamed
for the murders, but then found innocent,

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.270
leaving the crimes unsolved, and the murderer
unknown.

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.530
Back at the building, Sam again marks the
best rupture points to knock down the building,

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.040
but she is surprised when a man runs towards
her carrying an ax.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.820
It turns out that this man is one of the tenants
who still lives in this building and refuses

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.040
to leave.

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.500
And he is unhappy about the destruction of
the building.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.910
At night, Jimmy secretly takes Sam to the
eighth floor, the forbidden floor.

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.980
Jimmy tells Sam about Malestrazza, the architect
of the building, who died inside the wall.

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.090
He enters a room and shows her the wall where
Malestrazza's body was found.

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.400
When his body was found, his face was almost
ripped off because of the cement; his face

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.540
was no longer recognizable.

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.860
His mother, Mary, was the one who finally
managed to identify him.

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.850
Jimmy also informs her that out of the 16
victims; there was a small child named Julie.

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.590
She was the child shown at the beginning of
the film.

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.680
She was also the child living in the room
Sam saw before.

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.600
Furthermore, Jimmy tells her that his father
was also one of the victims.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.890
He then proceeds to show her the wall where
his father was found.

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:28.860
The lights go out, and Sam cuts her leg after
panicking in the darkness.

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.890
Later, Jimmy washes her wound and begins to
caress her thigh.

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.981
It becomes obvious that the young guy fancies
her, and he tries to make a move on her, but

00:03:36.981 --> 00:03:39.450
she tells him to stop.

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.780
In the evening, Sam, who is looking in the
mirror, sees the glass behind her shaking

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.030
violently.

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.150
She lifts the mirror and sees blood flowing
out of the hole.

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.480
Suddenly, Sam is immediately pulled into the
wall, and she wakes up realizing that she

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:53.780
is now trapped inside.

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:58.100
A moment later, cement begins pouring down
on her from all angles.

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.030
She cannot go anywhere else.

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.180
As she starts screaming, she wakes up from
her sleep.

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.760
It turns out to be a nightmare.

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.340
As she can no longer sleep, she wanders around
her apartment.

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.970
Suddenly, something appears right in front
of her, shocking her.

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:16.560
However, it's just her boyfriend, Peter, who
wants to give her a surprise.

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.900
Sam takes Peter to look around the apartment.

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.060
They secretly go to the eighth floor.

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.780
While exploring the eighth floor, Sam and
her boyfriend discover a secret passageway

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.229
on the floor.

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:29.360
Sam goes down it, and she discovers a secret
room.

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.909
This room would allow someone to view any
of the apartments secretly.

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:37.660
Sam realizes that Jimmy has been spying on
her while she's taking a bath.

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:43.050
She talks to Mary about it, and Jimmy, who
feels embarrassed, walks away.

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.789
Later that evening, Peter thinks that Sam
should leave tomorrow, and she agrees with him

00:04:47.517 --> 00:04:51.979
As Peter and Sam spend their time together
that night, Jimmy grows jealous of them.

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:55.460
The following day, Sam packs her clothes to
leave the apartment.

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.710
She also prepares a report on how much T.N.T
is needed to knock down this building.

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:04.039
Before parting, Jimmy apologizes to Sam for
spying on her.

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:05.889
He then gives a gift to Sam.

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:10.160
He gives Sam a copy of the journal of Malestrazza,
the building's architect.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.979
Sam realizes from reading the journal that
there must be a large, open space in the center

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:15.409
of the building.

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:18.439
Jimmy goes to the roof to look for an opening
to the hidden space.

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:20.930
However, he does not return.

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:23.249
Sam and her boyfriend follow to look for Jimmy.

00:05:23.249 --> 00:05:26.500
They discover a massive shaft in the center
of the building.

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:30.380
They hear Jimmy calling from down in the shaft,
saying that he is hurt.

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:33.090
Sam has her boyfriend lower her into the shaft
on a rope.

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:37.460
At first, everything goes smoothly, without
any problems at all.

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:40.909
But suddenly, Peter is shot by someone with
sharp iron.

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:45.870
As a result, Peter dies bleeding in front
of his girlfriend, who's shocked seeing this.

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:47.840
Sam falls to the bottom.

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.029
Sam awakens at the bottom of the shaft.

00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:54.189
Surprisingly, she is not alone there; there
is a mysterious person.

00:05:54.189 --> 00:05:59.120
To her surprise, that mysterious man is Malestrazza,
the architect, who she thought has been dead

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.689
entombed in the wall.

00:06:00.689 --> 00:06:03.460
It turns out that he has been trapped there
this whole time.

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:05.969
Malestrazza is holding a radio.

00:06:05.969 --> 00:06:10.219
In the radio recording, there is jimmy's voice
asking for help; in other words, the voice

00:06:10.219 --> 00:06:13.779
that Sam heard earlier is pre-recorded by
Jimmy himself.

00:06:13.779 --> 00:06:16.520
Shortly, Jimmy sends her a letter from above.

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:20.256
In the letter, it is written that Jimmy is
keeping her down there until she learns to love him

00:06:22.139 --> 00:06:26.719
Jimmy then mails Sam's demolition report to
her father and sinks her car into a lake.

00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:30.110
This is all done to create the perception
that Sam hasn't returned home because she

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:32.800
goes on vacation with her boyfriend.

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:36.460
Back in the shaft, Malestrazza tells her a
shocking revelation.

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:40.949
He reveals that he was the mastermind behind
the murders of 16 people (who were found entombed

00:06:40.949 --> 00:06:41.949
in the wall).

00:06:41.949 --> 00:06:46.229
Malestrzza believes that the secret to the
longevity of ancient Egyptian monuments is

00:06:46.229 --> 00:06:50.530
that they conducted rituals during construction
that involved burying living victims inside

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:51.530
the walls.

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:56.400
He wants his buildings to last forever, so
he buried people alive inside its walls.

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:59.469
He further reveals that one of the victims
was Mary's husband.

00:06:59.469 --> 00:07:04.530
So, as an act of revenge, Mary decides to
keep Malestrazza locked up in this shaft,

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:06.229
forever as a prisoner.

00:07:06.229 --> 00:07:10.979
Mary also fooled everybody by identifying
other victim's body as Malestraza's.

00:07:10.979 --> 00:07:14.729
Everyone believed that lie and thought that
Maleztrazza had died, so that she can keep

00:07:14.729 --> 00:07:17.969
Malestrazza herself as her prisoner.

00:07:17.969 --> 00:07:22.899
After this shocking revelation, Jimmy is back
at the hole and sends down a cassette tape.

00:07:22.899 --> 00:07:27.349
Malestrazza plays the tape, and Jimmy says
that he wants to see Sam and Malestrazza dance.

00:07:28.021 --> 00:07:31.370
Malestrazza tells her that they need to obey
Jimmy's order.

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:35.889
If they do what Jimmy wants, Jimmy is nice,
but can be very cruel and imaginative if they

00:07:35.889 --> 00:07:37.830
disobey Jimmy's orders.

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:40.099
So, Sam agrees to dance.

00:07:40.099 --> 00:07:44.139
But, when Jimmy tells them to kiss, she refuses.

00:07:44.139 --> 00:07:46.979
Malestrazza pulls her close and forces her
to kiss him.

00:07:46.979 --> 00:07:51.110
After a few seconds, Jimmy tells them to stop
and threatens Malestrazza not to touch Sam

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:52.370
again.

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:57.423
As a gift for their obedience, Jimmy sends
down a basket with food, water, and a two-way radio

00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:02.050
He tells Sam to keep the radio with her so
that they can talk and be close.

00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:04.830
Later that night, Mary comes to the roof.

00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:07.689
Sam immediately screams to get help from Mary.

00:08:07.689 --> 00:08:11.370
Mary is very surprised to see Sam in the hole
with Malestrazza.

00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:16.000
Mary angrily tells Jimmy that the place was
for the architect, not for anyone else.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.240
She realizes that Sam must stay in the hole
with Malestrazza, or else she'll report this

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:24.960
incident to the police, and they'll take Mary
away, and Jimmy will be an orphan.

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:29.990
In the afternoon, Sam's father and his demolition
team, who have received Sam's report, arrive

00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:31.349
at this apartment.

00:08:31.349 --> 00:08:33.560
They begin to set up the explosives.

00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:37.370
Elsewhere, Sam is still stuck in the hole
with Malestrazza.

00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:41.880
Sam continues to seduce Jimmy hoping that
he will free her and save her from the explosion.

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:44.090
However, her effort is unsuccessful.

00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:48.010
Seeing this, Malestrazza tells her to save
her energy.

00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:52.206
Malestrazza then digs a tomb that he has designed
with several pipes connected to the cement tank

00:08:52.963 --> 00:08:56.860
Malestrazza believes that when the detonation
team tries to knock this building down, it

00:08:56.860 --> 00:09:00.209
will not be destroyed if an additional person
is buried alive.

00:09:00.209 --> 00:09:03.690
He decides to sacrifice himself to save this
building.

00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:05.730
He then asks Sam to kill him.

00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:09.889
She eventually does kill him after some taunting,
and he thanks her after he falls into his

00:09:09.889 --> 00:09:12.329
tomb, and it begins to fill with cement.

00:09:12.329 --> 00:09:17.330
Meanwhile, outside the building, Mary is keeping
Jimmy calm as they set up and begin to install

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:18.790
the explosives.

00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:22.320
As the countdown begins, Jimmy starts to change
his mind.

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:25.160
He screams Sam’s name and runs toward the
building.

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:28.050
Sam's father tells them to stop the countdown.

00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:31.870
At the roof, Jimmy looks down, and her father
asks what they have done.

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:36.240
Jimmy then throws himself over, killing himself,
and lands next to Sam.

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:39.769
Sam is then lifted out of the hole and put
in an ambulance.

00:09:39.769 --> 00:09:43.990
Mary is arrested as she is involved in the
kidnapping of Malestrazza.

00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:48.339
At the end of the film, Sam narrates that
Malestrazza built 27 buildings and that they

00:09:48.339 --> 00:09:50.149
are all still standing.

00:09:50.149 --> 00:09:54.769
He considered this apartment building as his
masterpiece; he didn’t want it to be demolished.

00:09:54.769 --> 00:09:57.420
He even sacrificed himself to save the building.

00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:02.639
So, as a sign of respect, this building will
not be demolished and will remain his legacy.

00:10:02.639 --> 00:10:06.491
And that's how the movie ends
