00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.960
Welcome back to Movie Shortens.

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:05.569
Follow us today to a movie titled: Pet Sematary.

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:08.810
Be aware, spoilers ahead!

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:12.941
The Creeds are on their way from Chicago to
Maine to relocate the family.

00:00:12.941 --> 00:00:19.070
They are doctor Louis, Rachel, two children
Ellie, Gage, and their cat Church.

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.050
Ellie is delighted and begins playing with
the swing in the yard as the parents inspect

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.539
the property, which they adore.

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.430
Just then, the rope snaps and Ellie falls.

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:34.280
At the same time, Louis and Rachel take care
of Ellie, a red truck speeds by, and the infant

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.480
waves hello.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.699
Luckily, Gage is saved by a kindly older man
named Jud, who warns the family that these

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:43.870
trucks can hit quicker than they can scream.

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.710
While getting to know each other, Rachel asks
Jud where the path leads to in front of their

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:49.710
house.

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.940
Jud replies he'll take the family to visit
it once they all settle in.

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.449
While Louis wanders around the new house at
night and still questions the mysterious path,

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.859
Jud calls him over for a beer.

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:05.630
The two talks about how awful the road is
and reveal the walkway lead to a pet cemetery.

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.850
Most dogs and cats that get hit on the road
will end up being buried there.

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.560
The following morning, Jud keeps the promise
to take the Creeds to the path, where they

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.700
visit the pet cemetery.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.450
Rachel thinks it is unfortunate seeing children
upset about their dead pets.

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.359
Jud explains that the road is horrible, making
the children broken-hearted when they lose

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:26.689
their pet friends.

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:31.799
Anyway, they sometimes have to learn about
death, so the pet cemetery's idea is actually

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:32.799
humane.

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:37.649
That night, Ellie asks her father what if
her pet Church dies.

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:42.570
Louis tries to console her by telling her
that the cat has a long life ahead of it.

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.619
The next day, Jud arrives at work for the
first day at the University of Maine.

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:51.480
An injured youngster who others are claiming
was hit by a truck.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.830
They hurry him into the emergency room, covered
in blood, and summon Dr. Louis.

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.479
As Louis sits next to him, the youngster appears
to be dead.

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:04.190
Suddenly, the boy opens his eyes and aggressively
clutches Dr. Creed, peering into his eyes

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.549
and whispering his name, saying his last words
that he'll come for Louis.

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:11.740
The doctor becomes astonished as the patient
figures out his name.

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.940
That night, as Louis is sleeping, he is startled
awake by the young man from earlier in the

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.920
day, who appears in the bedroom doorway, still
bloody from head to toe.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.830
The two start strolling down the pet cemetery
route together, with the boy leading the way.

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.520
He says this is where the dead speaks, but
don't go any farther because this is where

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:32.770
the dead walk.

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.910
Dr. Louis claims that he wants to wake up
before laying down on the ground.

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:42.150
Just then, Louis opens his eyes in bed, but
as he pulls back the covers, he notices that

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.200
his feet are covered in mud, and that grass
has clung to his feet.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.020
It's Thanksgiving Day, and Rachel will be
spending the day with her father's family,

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:55.660
who, we learn, dislike Louis so that he will
be alone at home.

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.370
Louis gets a call from his neighbor Jud, who
says there's a dead cat on the edge of his

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:01.370
lawn.

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.940
Louis discovers that it is Church as he makes
his way across the busy street.

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.730
Now he is concerned that Ellie will suffer
as Church is her best pet.

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.310
Louis says he'll bury him the following day
and that he might lie to Ellie, saying he

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:15.750
hasn't seen the cat.

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:22.050
Jud says that there is a better way and guides
Louis into Pet's Sematary, armed with a shovel.

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:26.290
According to Jud, Louis must follow Jud's
footsteps since he knows the route over a

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.130
massive wooden barricade.

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.800
The two reach a burial place after a long
walk.

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.190
Jud remarks on the shallow dirt and hands
the shovel to Louis, telling him he must do

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:36.430
it independently.

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:41.800
Louis finishes excavating and finally places
the cat in a hole after it gets dark.

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:46.490
Returning home, Jud tells Louis not to tell
anyone about what they did tonight.

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:51.530
The following morning, Louis finds Church
is not dead and comes back.

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.520
While examining the returned dead cat, Church
scratches Louis in his face.

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.470
Louis mentions the cat with Jud later.

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:04.980
Jud also describes how he learned about the
burial area from an Indian after losing his

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.810
pet dog in 1925.

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.180
The dog did reappear after he buried him,
but he was a different dog.

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:17.720
Jud claims that he decided to revive Church
primarily for Ellie because she is too little

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.180
to understand.

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:24.280
Louis inquires about persons being buried
in the cemetery, to which Jud responds that

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.260
no one would do so.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:31.850
During this time, Church continues to act
strange and dark, making Louis worried and

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:32.960
scared.

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.660
When the family returns home, Ellie inquires
about Church.

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:42.970
She tells Louis that she had a dream of Church
being dead and that dad and Jud buried him.

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:46.810
Louis comforts his girl that the cat is totally
fine.

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:51.240
At night, Louis and Rachel start talking about
Rachel's sister, who suffered from severe

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.430
illness years ago.

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.990
Rachel was forced to feed the sister by herself
alone when she was only eight.

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:03.040
The family wanted the sister to die because
she had begun to resemble a monster and was

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.580
never satisfied with Rachel's care.

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.740
Finally, she died, which relieved the family,
including Rachel.

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:14.090
Louis tries to console Rachel, telling her
that it was her parents' fault and Rachel

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:16.550
was too young at the time.

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:20.280
Sometime later, Gage enjoys the picnic time
with Jud and his family.

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:24.750
He chases a kite as it continues to move forward
until it reaches the roadway.

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:30.710
Meanwhile, a massive red truck rushing down
a hill as Gage approaches the road.

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:36.850
The entire family chases after him, but in
the center of the road, Gage is run over.

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:39.270
The whole family is grief-stricken.

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:43.610
When Louis starts drinking and conversing
with Jud, the topic of the burial ground comes

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:44.610
up.

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:46.889
People have been buried there, according to
Jud.

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:51.120
Timmy Bateman was a young boy and died near
the conclusion of World Wide II.

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:56.270
Timmy's father, Bill, placed his son's corpse
into the Micmac burial ground, only to have

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:57.430
it reanimated.

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:03.740
However, when Timmy returned after 4 or 5
days, his mother declared him an abomination

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:09.650
who needed to be dealt with, so Jud and other
men went to the house and set fire while Timmy

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:11.150
was still inside.

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:16.030
Judd resents himself for introducing Louis
to the sour grounds, admitting sometimes it's

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:17.032
preferable to be dead.

00:06:17.032 --> 00:06:21.190
The person being put up there isn't the same
anymore.

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:25.010
Whatever exists outside of the pet cemetery
isn't human.

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:29.160
However, Louis seems firm with his intention

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:34.130
After the funeral, Rachel's family takes Ellie
and Rachel to Chicago to make them feel better,

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:36.400
leaving Louis alone yet again.

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:41.540
Later, Louis arrives in the cemetery with
a tool bag and sitting next to Gage's grave,

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:46.350
where he encounters the bloody Pascow, who
cries and tells him not to contemplate his

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:47.780
dark deeds.

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:52.790
Elsewhere in Chicago, Pascow continues to
haunt Ellie and Rachel in their dreams, attempting

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:54.160
to stop Louis.

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:58.530
However, Louis begins digging Gage's grave
late at night.

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:03.000
Rachel runs home from Chicago, accompanied
by Pascow, attempting to warn her about what

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.449
Louis is planning.

00:07:04.449 --> 00:07:09.900
At the same time, Louis begins his journey
up to the burial ground while carrying Gage.

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:14.410
Louis arrives at the cemetery late at night,
just as Rachel is speeding home in a rented

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:18.660
car when she crashes into some trees on a
dark road.

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:22.080
As Louis finishes burying Gage, he returns
home being exhausted.

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:27.710
Gage's new burial spot begins to move, and
a small hand is seen lifting rocks from atop

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:28.840
his tomb.

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:33.160
During the night, the door is shoved open,
revealing Gage's tiny legs.

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:35.960
Gage is grunting and cooing around the house.

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:40.550
He comes across his father's medicine kit
and opens it to reveal a gleaming silver scalpel.

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:45.980
Jud wakes up on his porch, noticing something
going on at Louis' house, and hurries over

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:47.290
to investigate.

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:52.010
He can hear Gage laughing as he enters the
house, so he looks around and finds the boy.

00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:57.010
Gage's hand appears from under a table clutching
the scalpel, pierces through Jud's achilles

00:07:57.010 --> 00:07:59.680
heel, and straight through his lips.

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:04.250
The evil boy takes a big bite out of Jud's
neck as Church looks on.

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:08.960
When Rachel returns home from her journey,
she notices Church outdoors, licking his injured

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:10.050
paw.

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:15.051
She shouts out for Jud as she walks into the
house, but she hears a voice calling her name.

00:08:15.051 --> 00:08:18.620
Her sister's ghost greets her as she enters
an upstairs room.

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:23.510
She then takes Rachel to Jud's house, where
she finds Gage in an upstairs bedroom.

00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:27.660
Gage says he brought her something and shows
her Louis' scalpel.

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:32.440
Rachel hugs her son in disbelief, and her
fate is unsure.

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:35.419
Louis wakes up the following day and stumbles
out of bed.

00:08:35.419 --> 00:08:40.869
He sees numerous small muddy footprints leaving
the room and the absence of his scalpel.

00:08:40.869 --> 00:08:46.230
Preparing shots of morphine, Louis heads to
Jud's house, running into Church once more.

00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:50.819
He distracts the cat with a raw steak, then
kills him with a shot of morphine.

00:08:50.819 --> 00:08:54.120
As Gage laughs in the background, he uncovers
Jud's body.

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:58.300
He makes his way down the hall, where Rachel's
corpse emerges from the attic with a rope

00:08:58.300 --> 00:08:59.560
around her neck.

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:04.910
Gage then jumps down on top of Louis and cuts
him a few times using the scalpel on the face

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:06.320
and body.

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:10.860
At this point, Louis injects the boy with
a morphine shot, making him ultimately slip

00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:13.509
down and die in the corridor.

00:09:13.509 --> 00:09:17.100
Then Louis pours gasoline all over the house
and sets it on fire.

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:23.350
Louis flees the scene with Rachel's body in
his arms, bringing her to the ground yet again.

00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:27.430
After he buries Rachel, he returns home and
waits for his wife to come back.

00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:31.959
Just then, Rachel does return, and they start
kissing each other passionately.

00:09:31.959 --> 00:09:38.920
Meanwhile, Rachel lunges for a kitchen knife
on the table, followed by a scream from Louis.
