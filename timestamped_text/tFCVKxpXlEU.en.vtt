00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.420
Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:05.109
Today, I'm going to explain a Sci-fi film
called "Demolition Man."

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:06.559
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:08.309
Watch out and take care.

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.330
In 1996, parts of Los Angeles had fallen to
the hands of hardened criminals who protect

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.469
their racket by killing anyone who walks into
their territory.

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:19.050
Somewhere in the city, one gang had just hijacked
a bus with 30 passengers because the driver

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.500
dared to pass through an area under their
control.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.920
The man most keen on stopping the thugs is
John Spartan, who has earned the epithet "the

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.160
Demolition Man" for his habit of leaving a
trail of destruction when he goes after criminals.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.010
On the way to the gang's headquarters, Spartan
tells Officer Zachary Lamb that he has a hunch

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.850
that the gang leader is the maniac named Simon
Phoenix.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.430
Upon their arrival, Spartan jumps to the top
of the building and maims several thugs as

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.280
Phoenix watches him from the monitors.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.559
Phoenix, enraged by Spartan's arrival, punctures
several barrels of gasoline as the police

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:51.260
officer draws closer to his location.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.800
After evading a few more goons, Spartan makes
his way to the room where Phoenix awaits.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.219
He asks Phoenix where the hostages are, but
he refuses to divulge their location.

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.390
When Spartan threatens to shoot the Phoenix,
the criminal warns Spartan that he's standing

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.180
in a pool of gasoline, and he's ready to light
him up.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.500
With Spartan unable to make a move, Phoenix
calmly lights up a cigarette and throws it

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.130
on the gas-covered floor.

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.090
As the gas ignites, Spartan backs away from
the fire and charges Phoenix.

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.260
Spartan asks Phoenix again where he kept the
bus passengers as they strike blows against

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:18.260
each other.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.200
Phoenix, however, still refuses to tell him,
so Spartan knocks him out and carries him

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.940
out of the burning building.

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.250
Spartan and Phoenix barely escaped when the
barrels start exploding.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.750
After the explosion, the police chief scolds
Spartan for going after Phoenix when he wasn't

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.350
even assigned to the case.

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.770
When the captain asks Spartan about the hostages,
he says he had done a thermal scan to search

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.370
for them, but he only saw Phoenix's men.

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:41.050
Phoenix overhears the conversation and contends
that Spartan is wrong.

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.740
A fireman soon informs the captain that they've
found around 30 bodies in the ruins of the

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:45.970
building.

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.020
Phoenix claims that he's tried telling Spartan
about the hostages, but the cop didn't care.

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.840
Spartan begins to worry as the police chief
advises him to contact his lawyer.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.810
Soon, Spartan is convicted of involuntary
manslaughter and sentenced to spend 70 years

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.210
in cryo-stasis.

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.060
As part of the rehabilitation program, Spartan
will be placed under synaptic suggestion in

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.360
his frozen state.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.320
As soon as the warden, William Smithers, finishes
reading the sentence, Spartan is placed in

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:10.660
a cylindrical encasement.

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.820
While the container is filled with liquid,
the warden takes a canister and loads it onto

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:14.820
the cryogenic machine.

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:19.440
A ball of chemical is released onto Spartan's
container, freezing him in an instant.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.160
Thirty-six years later, Los Angeles is now
merged with San Diego and Santa Barbara to

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.410
form the megacity called San Angeles.

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.270
Lieutenant Lenina Huxley gives Smithers a
call to ask about the situation at the cryo-penitentiary

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.260
as she patrols the streets.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.200
The warden assures her that there is nothing
to worry about because the prisoners are frozen.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.290
Huxley drives back to the station, telling
Smithers that she's disappointed by the lack

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:40.820
of activity.

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:45.640
Down in the sewers, Edgar Friendly looks through
his periscope to observe a van as it drives

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.310
away after delivering food to an establishment.

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.520
Friendly surmises that another van will arrive
in twelve hours, noting that the movement

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.850
of goods in the city has become too predictable.

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:53.850
His associate warns him that there will not
be enough of them to rob the vehicle when

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:54.850
it returns, but Friendly argues that they
have nothing left to lose.

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.680
At the police station, Captain George Earle
issues a warning to Huxley, as she seems to

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.550
be longing for some crime to happen so she
could get some action.

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.210
When she enters her office, she whispers an
expletive to describe the police chief, causing

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:08.550
the automated machine to give her a fine of
half a credit for cussing.

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:13.060
Officer Alfredo Garcia follows the lieutenant,
telling her that the encounter with the police

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.930
chief was quite intense.

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.240
Huxley asks Garcia if he doesn't get bored
chasing after people who break curfew or other

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.150
culprits who tell dirty jokes.

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.310
Garcia tells her that he finds his current
job profoundly fulfilling.

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.490
On the other hand, Huxley is getting fed up
with her current situation due to the lack

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:28.470
of challenges on the streets.

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.290
In the cryo-penitentiary, the warden unfreezes
Phoenix for his parole hearing.

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.790
As he is briefed about the proceedings, Phoenix
antagonizes the warden and suddenly utters

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.290
the words, "teddy bear," causing his shackles
to unlock.

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:42.090
Phoenix immediately attacks the guards, who
are left wondering how the prisoner knew the

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.720
password to the cuffs.

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.110
After he kills them, Phoenix takes the warden's
eye and holds it in front of the retinal scanners

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:48.709
to open the door.

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:52.540
As Phoenix makes his way out of the facility,
the police station receives an alert for code

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.280
187 from the central computer L7.

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.250
The cops don't recognize the code, so Huxley
looks it up on the computer.

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.709
They are soon shocked to learn that it's MurderDeathKill,
which they haven't encountered in over 16

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:03.709
years.

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:06.680
They're even more horrified when L7 shows
them live footage of Smithers crawling on

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.430
the floor just before he dies from his severe
injuries.

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.310
Huxley looks up the list of prisoners scheduled
for parole that day and discovers that one

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:13.910
of them is Simon Phoenix.

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:17.680
Huxley tries to find more information on Phoenix
by looking up his access code, but Zachary

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.020
Lamb says he is not coded because he was frozen
before the city implanted chips in the residents.

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:25.940
As Huxley reads about Phoenix's arrest record,
L7 informs them that Phoenix has killed more

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.620
people before leaving the cryo-penitentiary.

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.380
Huxley pinpoints the criminal's location by
tracking the vehicle he stole.

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.310
Phoenix soon learns that he has gained new
skills when he stops by an information booth

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:36.960
to look up Edgar Friendly.

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.160
When he sees Friendly's file, he suddenly
hears a voice in his head, suggesting that

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.810
he should kill Friendly.

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:45.000
Officers soon arrive at the scene while he
uses the computer to find out where to acquire

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000
firearms.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.550
The police, however, have no clue how to deal
with Phoenix due to their lack of experience.

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.840
Phoenix activates the anti-graffiti mechanism
on the wall to incapacitate a cop standing

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:54.900
close to it.

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.990
He then beats the remaining officers with
his bare hands and taunts the police watching

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.090
him from the security cameras at the station.

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:05.150
Dr. Raymond Cocteau, the man who governs the
megacity, soon receives information about

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:07.880
the M.D.K. incidents following Phoenix's escape.

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:12.150
So he calls Earle and tells him to do everything
in his power to apprehend the escaped felon.

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:15.350
Huxley learns Spartan was the only one who
managed to arrest Phoenix, so she suggests

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:18.290
unfreezing Spartan to find and catch the fugitive
again.

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:22.650
Soon, they take Spartan out of cryo-stasis
and reinstate him to the police force, despite

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:24.580
the apprehensions of Captain Earle.

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:28.040
After Spartan regains consciousness, he learns
that his wife has died in the great earthquake

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:31.210
of 2010, and his daughter's whereabouts are
unknown.

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:34.510
Huxley then informs him that Phoenix had escaped
from prison that morning and had already committed

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:35.880
11 murders.

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:39.030
Spartan asks for a cigarette, but Huxley tells
him that it's banned because anything deemed

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:41.250
unhealthy has been declared illegal.

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:44.640
Spartan soon receives a fine from L7 after
he spews out an expletive when he finds out

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:48.060
that alcohol, meat, and contact sports have
been banned as well.

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:51.700
Earle tells him to get ready to find Pheonix,
but Spartan refuses, arguing that he ended

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:54.600
up being frozen when he caught the maniac
36 years ago.

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.590
Earle tells Spartan that he has no choice
but to arrest Phoenix again if he doesn't

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:00.020
want to go back to cryo-stasis.

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:02.760
Huxley informs Spartan that it's hard for
them to track Phoenix down because he doesn't

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.950
have a microchip implant on his hand.

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:08.350
When Spartan dismisses the implant as fascist,
the police chief tells him that he also has

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:09.620
one in his hand.

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:12.810
Earle argues that they don't need Spartan
to catch Phoenix because the computer already

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:14.180
had predicted the criminal's next moves.

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:15.639
L7 has concluded that Phoenix will set up
a drug lab and try to assemble a new gang.

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:18.270
Spartan, however, believes that Phoenix will
go somewhere he can steal firearms, which

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:20.770
are now only found in museums.

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:24.590
Phoenix soon finds his way to the San Angeles
Museum of History, as Spartan had predicted.

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:28.430
The fugitive heads straight for the armory
after finding out its location from the kiosk.

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:33.150
Spartan, Huxley, and Garcia go to the museum,
although Huxley is still skeptical that Phoenix

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:37.230
would succeed in grabbing the weapons because
they're stored in a maximum-security exhibit.

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:40.650
Upon reaching the armory, Phoenix jumps with
glee before trying to break the display with

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:41.750
his fists.

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:46.510
When he fails, Phoenix slams one of the museum's
guards through the glass, causing it to shatter.

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:50.070
Phoenix then grabs a shotgun and uses it to
break the other displays that house more powerful

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:51.170
weapons.

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:54.980
Spartan and his companions approach the museum
armed with a glow rod, which can only stun

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:56.259
its target.

00:06:56.259 --> 00:06:59.100
Spartan tells the other two to wait for him
outside and give him 10 minutes to arrest

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:00.380
Phoenix.

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:03.389
Spartan soon catches up to Phoenix, but the
criminal immediately shoots at him as soon

00:07:03.389 --> 00:07:04.620
as he appears.

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:08.870
As Spartan takes cover, he finds a shotgun
on the floor and uses it to fire back at Phoenix,

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:11.350
causing the felon to fall back to another
room.

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:14.960
As the firefight continues, Spartan notices
that Phoenix is hiding behind a kiosk with

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:16.340
a nearby lamp.

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:19.780
So Spartan shoots the lamp, making it fall
through the glass floor.

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:22.889
Phoenix falls to an exhibit of downtown Los
Angeles that was preserved after the quake

00:07:22.889 --> 00:07:25.070
rocked the city in 2010.

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:29.040
Phoenix soon gets up and shoots back at Spartan,
causing him to fall to the same area.

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:32.440
Phoenix tries a powerful laser gun called
the AcMag on Spartan, but the cop manages

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:34.020
to dodge it.

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:38.380
Phoenix loses his weapon, so he proceeds to
beat Spartan up with his martial arts skills.

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:40.580
Spartan swings an old T.V. at Phoenix to knock
him down.

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:44.830
He then uses the glow rod to electrocute the
felon while he's standing on a puddle.

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:48.350
Phoenix manages to grab hold of the AcMag
again and shoots it at Spartan, causing the

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:49.860
cop to take cover.

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:53.199
Phoenix runs out of the museum and comes across
Cocteau and his assistant Bob.

00:07:53.199 --> 00:07:56.590
The felon tries to shoot Cocteau, but he can't
seem to pull the trigger.

00:07:56.590 --> 00:08:00.590
Cocteau asks Phoenix about the thought repeating
in his brain, ordering him to kill Friendly.

00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:03.979
Cocteau reiterates the command to Phoenix,
but their impromptu meeting is soon interrupted

00:08:03.979 --> 00:08:05.770
when Spartan catches up.

00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:09.350
After Phoenix leaves, Cocteau thanks Spartan
for saving his life and invites him to dinner.

00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:13.300
At the restaurant, Cocteau brags to Spartan
how he restored order to the megacity when

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:15.770
there was nothing but chaos and destruction.

00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:19.169
Spartan tells him that he'd rather live elsewhere
due to the strict rules in San Angeles.

00:08:19.169 --> 00:08:22.710
Cocteau argues Spartan would've been executed
for his crimes, so he should be grateful that

00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:24.930
they opted to put him in cryo-stasis instead.

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:28.710
Spartan, however, tells them that his frozen
state was no picnic because he had nightmares

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:31.020
about the people burning in Phoenix's headquarters.

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:34.839
During their meal, Spartan suddenly sees suspicious
men outside the restaurant, so he goes after

00:08:34.839 --> 00:08:35.899
them.

00:08:35.899 --> 00:08:39.429
Friendly and his gang soon emerge from the
sewers to rob the van delivering food to the

00:08:39.429 --> 00:08:40.429
restaurant.

00:08:40.429 --> 00:08:43.369
Spartan takes down several members of the
gang, so Friendly sends more people after

00:08:43.369 --> 00:08:44.369
him.

00:08:44.369 --> 00:08:47.730
When Spartan sees the mob chasing after him,
he cuts down the rope of a tent, causing the

00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:49.709
canvas to fall on his pursuers.

00:08:49.709 --> 00:08:53.179
While the spectators cheer for Spartan, Friendly
and a few of his people retreat into the sewers

00:08:53.179 --> 00:08:54.600
with some food.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:57.449
Spartan grabs one of the men to attack him,
but he stops when he finds out that they were

00:08:57.449 --> 00:08:59.040
stealing food.

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:02.199
Cocteau explains that those people were known
as "scraps," who had chosen to dwell under

00:09:02.199 --> 00:09:06.029
the sewers and abandoned tunnels instead of
living in comfort in the megacity.

00:09:06.029 --> 00:09:10.610
Bob informs Spartan that the scraps are the
last remaining criminal element in the city,

00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:13.360
and plans are already underway to get rid
of them.

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:16.920
When Cocteau and Bob arrive at their office,
they find Phoenix waiting for them.

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:20.260
Phoenix tells Cocteau that he is happy with
the new skills and knowledge he acquired during

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:21.630
his frozen state.

00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:25.170
Cocteau reminds him that those skills were
given to him so he could kill Friendly.

00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:28.360
Phoenix tells him that he needs more men to
execute his mission, so he provides Cocteau

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:32.290
with a list of criminals he wants to set free
from the cryo-penitentiary.

00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:35.939
Huxley takes Spartan back to her apartment
filled with 20th-century memorabilia.

00:09:35.939 --> 00:09:38.899
Huxley tells him that she was aroused when
she watched him fight the scraps earlier,

00:09:38.899 --> 00:09:41.279
so she invites him to have intercourse with
her.

00:09:41.279 --> 00:09:43.889
Spartan is perplexed by the offer, but he
agrees.

00:09:43.889 --> 00:09:47.389
Huxley goes to another room and comes back
with two virtual reality helmets.

00:09:47.389 --> 00:09:50.640
After putting on the device, she tells him
that they can begin to make love.

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:54.420
As soon as Spartan closes his eyes, he sees
himself being intimate with Huxley, but he

00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:58.069
soon becomes frustrated by the lack of physical
contact, so he breaks it off.

00:09:58.069 --> 00:10:01.490
He tells Huxley that he wants to do it the
"old-fashioned way," but the idea grosses

00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:02.490
her out.

00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:05.660
She tells him that kissing and other fluid
transfer activities have been outlawed because

00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:07.740
of the diseases that they caused.

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:11.379
Spartan tries to kiss Huxley, but she tells
him to leave her apartment.

00:10:11.379 --> 00:10:14.790
Spartan goes to his apartment and loads a
disc that Huxley gave to him earlier.

00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:18.019
The disc contains security footage showing
Cocteau being approached by Phoenix after

00:10:18.019 --> 00:10:20.110
the criminal raided the museum.

00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:23.050
Spartan sees that Cocteau did not seem afraid
of Phoenix even when the criminal pointed

00:10:23.050 --> 00:10:24.440
the gun at him.

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:28.489
The following day, Spartan apologizes to Huxley
by giving her a sweater he knitted the previous

00:10:28.489 --> 00:10:29.489
night.

00:10:29.489 --> 00:10:32.439
Spartan wonders how he had the knowledge to
knit, so Huxley tells him that the ability

00:10:32.439 --> 00:10:35.360
and desire were implanted on him as part of
his rehabilitation.

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:38.769
When they check Phoenix's rehab scheme, they're
surprised to find out that he had been programmed

00:10:38.769 --> 00:10:41.019
to become a more efficient killer.

00:10:41.019 --> 00:10:44.390
Huxley tells Spartan that Cocteau Industries
developed the program, so he decides to stop

00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:47.079
by Cocteau's office to confront him about
Phoenix.

00:10:47.079 --> 00:10:50.629
When Spartan reaches the video conference
room, Cocteau apologizes through the monitors

00:10:50.629 --> 00:10:54.260
that he can't be present physically because
he's dealing with important matters.

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:58.060
Spartan voices out his suspicions that Cocteau
had something to do with Phoenix's escape.

00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:01.809
Cocteau deflects from the issue by suggesting
that Spartan, not Phoenix, probably destroyed

00:11:01.809 --> 00:11:03.069
the museum.

00:11:03.069 --> 00:11:06.579
After shooting down the monitors, Spartan
manages to get to Cocteau's office and point

00:11:06.579 --> 00:11:09.769
a gun to his head, warning him that he wouldn't
be able to control Phoenix.

00:11:09.769 --> 00:11:13.009
Cocteau orders Huxley to return Spartan to
cryo-stasis because he is the one who is out

00:11:13.009 --> 00:11:14.589
of control.

00:11:14.589 --> 00:11:18.200
Instead of going back to the prison, Spartan
asks Huxley and Garcia to help him find Phoenix

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:19.579
below the sewers.

00:11:19.579 --> 00:11:22.869
He argues that they couldn't find the fugitive
because they don't monitor the sewers, and

00:11:22.869 --> 00:11:24.869
cops are afraid to go there.

00:11:24.869 --> 00:11:28.119
Down in the sewers, the trio soon comes across
Friendly while they're gawking at the beauty

00:11:28.119 --> 00:11:30.060
of a 1970 model Oldsmobile.

00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:33.480
They tell Friendly that they are not after
him, but they warn him that Cocteau wants

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:34.639
him dead.

00:11:34.639 --> 00:11:38.819
Meanwhile, Phoenix briefs the gang of men
and women who were just freed from the cryo-penitentiary.

00:11:38.819 --> 00:11:41.869
He tells them that they'll soon be running
the city when they kill Cocteau.

00:11:41.869 --> 00:11:46.699
As a bonus, they also get to kill Spartan,
who had put most of them under cryo-stasis.

00:11:46.699 --> 00:11:50.179
Phoenix and his gang soon come across Spartan
and Friendly while scouring the sewers.

00:11:50.179 --> 00:11:53.689
The goons start shooting at the cops, prompting
them to run for cover.

00:11:53.689 --> 00:11:58.019
Phoenix sees Spartan hiding as he protects
a civilian, so he aims his AcMag at the cop.

00:11:58.019 --> 00:12:01.290
But before he could shoot, Friendly sees him
and fires at the footpath where's Phoenix

00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:04.160
is standing, causing the outlaw to fall to
the ground.

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:08.639
Failing to kill Spartan, Phoenix escapes to
the surface and drives away in Huxley's car.

00:12:08.639 --> 00:12:12.329
Huxley and Spartan chase after Phoenix using
the Oldsmobile from the sewers.

00:12:12.329 --> 00:12:16.139
As they get close to Phoenix, Spartan shoots
down the vehicle's wheels, but Phoenix activates

00:12:16.139 --> 00:12:17.679
the auto-inflate.

00:12:17.679 --> 00:12:21.189
Spartan tells Huxley to take the steering
wheel and jumps onto Phoenix's car.

00:12:21.189 --> 00:12:24.490
Phoenix engages the auto-drive and tries to
push Spartan off the vehicle.

00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:27.989
As they struggle, Phoenix tells Spartan that
he had already killed the bus passengers he

00:12:27.989 --> 00:12:31.329
had taken as hostages in 1996 before the building
blew up.

00:12:31.329 --> 00:12:34.810
As Spartan hangs from the vehicle, Phoenix
punches him several times, but he hangs on

00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:36.899
and throws Phoenix out of the car.

00:12:36.899 --> 00:12:40.610
Spartan tries to stop the vehicle, but the
computer fails to follow his instruction.

00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:43.389
He manages to turn off the auto-pilot, but
the car won't break.

00:12:43.389 --> 00:12:46.540
After the car hits a glass display outside
a building, it starts filling up with foam

00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:48.170
to protect Spartan.

00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:51.379
Huxley arrives at the scene and helps Spartan
out of the vehicle.

00:12:51.379 --> 00:12:54.550
Phoenix pays another visit to Cocteau, who
is delighted that the destruction caused by

00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:56.379
Phoenix has left the people terrified.

00:12:56.379 --> 00:13:00.040
He tells Phoenix that he now has the mandate
to create a perfect society.

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:03.499
Phoenix tries to kill Cocteau again, but he's
still unable to pull the trigger.

00:13:03.499 --> 00:13:07.119
In frustration, he orders one of his men to
shoot Cocteau and throw his body into the

00:13:07.119 --> 00:13:08.389
fireplace.

00:13:08.389 --> 00:13:12.019
Phoenix sees Sparta and Huxley arrive at Cocteau
Industries through the security cam, sending

00:13:12.019 --> 00:13:13.880
two of his men to attack them.

00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:17.199
After dealing with the two gang members, Huxley
and Spartan find out that Cocteau has been

00:13:17.199 --> 00:13:18.199
killed.

00:13:18.199 --> 00:13:21.579
They also learn that Phoenix intends to unfreeze
more criminals, so they immediately prepare

00:13:21.579 --> 00:13:23.610
to follow him to the cryo-penitentiary.

00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:28.209
However, Spartan stuns Huxley with the glow
rod so he could deal with Phoenix on his own.

00:13:28.209 --> 00:13:32.249
At the prison complex, Phoenix is starting
to unfreeze the criminals with Bob's help.

00:13:32.249 --> 00:13:35.300
After learning that the process is already
in the final stages, he kills the remaining

00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:37.260
personnel at the facility.

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.889
Spartan soon arrives and engages Phoenix in
a shootout.

00:13:39.889 --> 00:13:43.489
While hiding from Spartan, Phoenix takes control
of a large mechanical claw and moves it toward

00:13:43.489 --> 00:13:44.949
Spartan to grab him.

00:13:44.949 --> 00:13:48.800
As Spartan hangs from the crane, Phoenix toys
with him by moving the claw around as he shoots

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:50.029
Spartan.

00:13:50.029 --> 00:13:53.470
Phoenix soon hits a pipe on the claw, causing
the freezing agent to leak out.

00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:56.839
Spartan then grabs the leaking pipe and directs
it to the crane so he could smash it after

00:13:56.839 --> 00:13:57.839
it freezes.

00:13:57.839 --> 00:14:01.269
After Spartan breaks free, Phoenix fires a
laser gun at him, but it soon runs out of

00:14:01.269 --> 00:14:02.449
energy.

00:14:02.449 --> 00:14:05.799
Phoenix engages Spartan in hand-to-hand combat
and gains the upper hand due to his acquired

00:14:05.799 --> 00:14:07.939
skills during cryo-stasis.

00:14:07.939 --> 00:14:11.379
Spartan fights back and manages to knock him
down once, but Phoenix quickly recovers and

00:14:11.379 --> 00:14:13.609
sweep kicks him to the ground.

00:14:13.609 --> 00:14:17.249
Phoenix tries to drop a barrel on Spartan,
but he dodges it and grabs a vial of the cryogenic

00:14:17.249 --> 00:14:18.709
chemical on the ground.

00:14:18.709 --> 00:14:22.119
As Phoenix approaches to attack him, Spartan
breaks the vial to release the chemical and

00:14:22.119 --> 00:14:23.329
freeze Phoenix.

00:14:23.329 --> 00:14:25.470
Spartan grabs onto a moving crane to avoid
getting frozen.

00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:29.470
When the crane reaches Phoenix, he kicks his
head off, causing it to fall to the ground

00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:30.800
and shatter.

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:34.350
Spartan runs out of the prison as the uncontrolled
freezing triggers a series of explosions throughout

00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:35.639
the facility.

00:14:35.639 --> 00:14:40.410
Outside, Spartan informs Earle that Phoenix
is dead and the cryo-prison is no longer functional.

00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:43.660
Earle worries that they won't be able to keep
peace and order in the megacity after Cocteau's

00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:47.019
death, but Spartan assures them that they'll
figure it out somehow.

00:14:47.019 --> 00:14:49.930
Huxley sarcastically tells Spartan that she
appreciates being knocked out to keep her

00:14:49.930 --> 00:14:50.930
safe.

00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:54.389
When she complains that they're supposed to
work together, Spartan agrees and kisses her.

00:14:54.389 --> 00:14:57.540
After breaking off the kiss, Huxley hears
that other fluid transfer activities feel

00:14:57.540 --> 00:15:07.559
even better, so she kisses Spartan again.
