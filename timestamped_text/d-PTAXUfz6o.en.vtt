00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:06.800
Welcome to Cinema Summary, ladies and
gentlemen everyone has birthdays:

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.020
Some good some bad.

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:10.060
It's all fun and games until it isn't.

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:12.010
This is THE GAME

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:15.879
The movie begins of a flashback to a family
photo (film) of an extravagant birthday party

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:19.180
a playful time for our protagonist
Nicolas van Orton now a wealthy

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.840
investment banker, in control and always
cool who on his birthday is told he got

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.100
a call from Mr. Seymour Butts he makes a
reservation at an upscale restaurant where

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.820
we meet Seymour Butts who is actually
his younger brother Conrad who seems to

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.969
be a troubled young man
Conrad comes to wish him a happy 40th

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:38.079
birthday and gives Nicholas an unusual
gift a voucher for a game offered by the

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:41.469
company Consumer Recreation Services (CRS for short)

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:44.530
Conrad tells him it will change his life
and then has a staff singing my happy

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.000
birthday much to his chagrin.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.550
Nicholas heads home and while he drives he has a

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.569
flashback to when he was a boy coming
back home only to see a person stand on

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:53.885
top of the roof of his house.

00:00:53.885 --> 00:00:56.199
At home he eats alone with the only company being a

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:59.739
phone call from his estranged ex-wife
Elizabeth who checks in on him since

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:03.249
Nicholas dad was 48 just like Nicholas
now, when he committed suicide

00:01:03.249 --> 00:01:06.880
it becomes strained after that and
Nicholas ends the call early but it gets

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.780
Nicholas thinking about the CRS's game
and he's a flashback once more this time

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.930
we see that the man on the roof is
Nick's dad who jumps to his death

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.220
Nicholas has doubts about CRS but he
makes a hesitative decision to have a

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.720
look at CRS's offices to apply for The Game.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.600
He meets Jim Feingold who takes

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.930
into his office to introduce him to The 
Game where he finds out his brother was

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.140
a client there but first he has to
take a bunch of long time consuming

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.740
psychological and physical tests that
take him all day to complete.

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.490
Just so he can qualify for the game and even after the
tests are complete he has to wait for

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.060
the results be processed. He's reluctant
because he has no idea of this so-called

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.750
game is but Jim tells him that it is
different for everyone and that he can

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.340
always quit if he doesn't like it so
Nick agrees;

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.160
after an afternoon playing squash

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.560
he overhears two businessmen talk
in the locker room about their

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.400
experiences with CRS and their game he
joins them later in a bar and asks them

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.610
what the experience of the game to which
the two businessman

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:58.800
are evasive and cryptic but recommended it.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.330
Before leaving one of the guys references a passage in the Bible

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.320
"Where once I was blind now I
see."

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.560
All thanks to the Game to which Nicholas is left stunned

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.960
The next day at a board room meeting Nicholas gets a phone

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.930
call from CRS and finds out that his
application was rejected and he can't

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.640
join to play the game

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.080
that night he arrives home where he sees a

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.440
body laying the ground in the same way
his dad was laying after he jumped

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.949
though one closer inspection it's
actually a clown doll

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:24.120
bringing it in inside

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.900
he pulls out a card of a key attached at
the end of it bearing the letters CRS

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.480
back in his study with a clown doll
seated he fiddles with it when the TV

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.500
begins glitching out and the newscaster
talks to Nicholas the newscaster on the

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.920
TV welcomes Nicholas to the game telling
him that he must find him many other Keys

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.800
like the one Nick just found and that
they'll help him later though he will

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.820
never know how a conversation between
the newscaster Nikolas ensues with the

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:49.150
newscaster admitting that he can see
exactly what Nikolas is doing because of

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.406
a little camera that's in his home the
eyes of the clown doll

00:02:52.406 --> 00:02:53.260
He also mentions

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.310
one more rule if Nick needs help he can
call the CRS hotline and ask for help

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.760
but only in emergencies
though he can't ask what the goal the Game

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.484
is with that the TV goes back to normal
and the game begins

00:03:04.484 --> 00:03:06.020
at the airport, the next day

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.500
Nicholas looks around him every
little thing could be part of the game

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.910
he gets paranoid but tries to focus and
after a few suspicious run-ins he meets

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.050
of his colleague Sam who sees him off to
his flight he arrives at the office of

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.890
Ansem a failing publisher who mentions
Nicholas's father while begging not to

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.360
be fired after a few choice words
Nicholas fires Ansem and demands Ansem

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:30.070
to sign some papers as he struggles to
get his briefcase open Nicholas tries the

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:33.520
CRS key to unlock it but it
doesn't work unable to get it open or

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.840
get Ansem signature he leaves Ansem
before he returns home as Nicholas waits

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.930
in a restaurant for Conrad a waitress
named Christine spills her tray full of

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.360
wine glasses
Nicholas a brushes off her attempts at

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.325
helping him and after she disrespects
her boss she is fired

00:03:46.325 --> 00:03:48.060
Nicholas is moved to another table

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.120
where he is shocked by
a bill from a mysterious waiter

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.240
Nicholas leaves the restaurant trying to find
Christine

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:54.920
who he thinks is part of the Game

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.960
coincidentally a man collapses in
front of them while Christine tries to help

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.000
Nicholas wonders if he's real

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.700
Nicholas gets help from a nearby police car and
an ambulance arrives to save the man

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.630
with Nicholas being forced to go of
Christine to the hospital lest he be

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:09.300
detained by the police

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.920
in the ambulance Nicholas shows Christine the bill which

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.700
bears the words don't let her get away
they arrived at the hospital parking lot

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.810
which suddenly becomes empty of people
after lights blackout Christine has no

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.960
idea what's going on to which Nicholas
helpfully tells her about the Game

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.260
wanting nothing to do with it Christine
leaves with Nicholas travelling after

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.440
her they try to take an inactive
elevator which only activates after

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.640
Nicky uses his CRS key on their way up
the elevator stops and blacks out with a

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:37.150
little choice they attempt to get out of
the elevator through the roof hatch they

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.930
climb their way out only to find
themselves on the CRS offices were they

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.680
trip the burglar alarm. They run away
avoiding cops and security and escape a

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.730
guard dog by going on to a fire escape
the ladder breaks so they are forced to

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:52.000
jump and land into the dumpsters below
to get away they make their way to

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.810
Nicholas's office where Nicholas calls a
cab and Christine takes a shower just

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:58.750
before she leaves Christine confesses
that someone paid her to spill drinks in

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:00.400
the attractive guy in this flannel suit

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.470
At home Nick is awoken by a phone call

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:05.860
from his secretary who tells him that
his missing American Express card was found

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:10.270
at the hotel Nico before he hangs up he
asks his secretary to check the taxi

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:14.110
company to find out where Christine was
dropped off at afterwards he calls the

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:17.290
hotel Nico where a receptionist
helpfully informs him that he has a room

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:20.260
with flowers in it and the woman he
invited there will be late

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:24.010
going there he bumps into a man before
approaching the receptionist signing off

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:27.310
in the room and after asking the
receptionist about a key he finds a key

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:30.920
card in his pocket he presumes it was
put there by the man he bumped into earlier

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:35.140
The room is mostly neat except
for a bedroom that's absolutely trashed

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:38.830
there are polaroid photos and coke and
on the table a porno plays in the

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:42.430
background and a bill signed in his
names of their alongside his missing

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:49.060
briefcase opening the case he finds a
pile of explicit photos when he hears a

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:51.880
knock at the door
Nicholas fiercely gets rid of this orgy

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.540
of evidence and cuts his hand doing so
he leaves of his briefcase in hand

00:05:55.540 --> 00:06:00.640
oblivious to the person following him
confused and stressed Nicolas spots the

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:05.680
car and confronts the driver who is a
sketchy man with a revolver, a photo of

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:10.750
Nicolas, and some files the man reveals
that he's a private investigator paid to

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:14.350
keep tabs on Nick but runs off before
Nicolas can ask more questions

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:18.550
a furious Nicolas drives to meet Sam at
the Ritz-Carlton where they go to meet

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:22.960
Ansem Nicolas chose out Ansem believing
him to be part of the game but then

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:27.700
Ansem tells him that he's accepted
Nicholas's deal; embarrassed Nicolas

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:32.169
apologizes before leaving for his office
where he asks Sam to investigate

00:06:32.169 --> 00:06:35.740
Consumer Recreation Services here
Nicolas gives Sam the limited liability

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:40.180
waiver that he signed but it's just a
blank piece of paper Sam leaves before

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:42.710
Nicholas opens up a black envelope and
pulls out

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:46.970
winch this might seem odd but it'll come
in handy later back home with lis

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:50.270
revolver in his briefcase
Nicholas finds something is wrong:

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:53.240
His security system has been tampered with
and his phone is off the hook

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:57.470
Nicky walks deeper into his home gun in
hand the lights turn on graffiti has

00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:01.070
been sprayed everywhere and lights
reveals secret messages in his bedroom

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:05.120
the clown doll sits with a message in
his mouth. In a panic Nicholas calls the

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:07.880
police when suddenly Conrad shows up! The duo

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:12.740
drive off with Conrad babbling on and on
about how CRS ruined his life and and no

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:14.860
matter what he pays them they won't
leave him alone

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:16.320
They get a flat tire

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:20.180
and while Nicholas goes to change it
Conrad pops the glove box open where CRS

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:24.410
keys spill out Conrad accuses Nicholas
of working with CRS

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:28.370
which Nicholas denies but Conrad walks away in
disbelief and he and Nicholas have an

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:32.330
angry heart-to-heart with Conrad calling
Nicholas out on his jealousy and his

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:36.950
desire to control everything before
Conrad runs off. Near the subway stairs a

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:40.430
phone rings and after picking up the
phone Nicholas hears the argument he

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:43.500
just had with Conrad minutes ago
playback.

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:44.750
Nicholas catches a cab when he

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:49.040
realizes something's wrong: he's missed
his turn and the driver is a CRS agent

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:53.210
the driver locks the passenger door and
speeds off driving into the bay the

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:56.960
driver jumps out before the cart sinks
with Nicky trapped inside.

00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:57.823
Inside Nicholas panics!

00:07:57.823 --> 00:08:00.110
"It's just a game! It's
just a game! There has to be a way out!"

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:05.700
when he remembers the winch from earlier
and he uses it to open the window and escape!

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:09.760
The next day, Nick is thoroughly
fed up with The Game and contacts the police

00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:15.230
and together with Sam visit the CRS
offices only to find it abandoned. The

00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:18.650
investigators reveal that the CRS has
never rented the building and the floor

00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:22.340
has never been rented out. The case
against the CRS is weak without any

00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:25.970
other leads and with little choice
Nicholas heads home where he gets a call

00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:29.990
from his secretary who found out where
Christine lives with that information in

00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:33.740
mind he drives to her home where he
shows her the lewd photos and asked if

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:38.000
the woman in the photos is her; she asks why
he thinks that and he points out the bra

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.680
she wears is red. The same bra that she
was wearing in his office. While she goes

00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:44.870
to change her clothes
Nicholas fiddles around her apartment

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:49.490
and soon discovers that she is a CRS
employee and that her apartment is a

00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:52.460
stage. Christine tells Nicholas
"they're" being watched from the smoke

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:56.139
detector and Nicholas, just absolutely
fed up attacks the

00:08:56.139 --> 00:09:00.189
because he just wants some answers
suddenly armed CRS gunmen begin to swarm

00:09:00.189 --> 00:09:04.120
the house and fire upon them and Nicholas
and Christine are forced to drive away

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:07.870
during which Christine tells Nicholas
that the CRS has drained his financial

00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:11.709
accounts by using the answer to the
psychological tests he took, to guess his

00:09:11.709 --> 00:09:16.180
passwords! In a panic Nikolas calls his
bank and while he's on the phone he

00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:19.140
spells out his password code to check his
account balance

00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:22.780
Blue 2\9690D

00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:26.180
Only to find out that his balance
is zero! They drive to Nicholas's

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:29.980
summer home where Nicky presses
Christine for information about CRS and

00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:33.459
her work with them over a cup of coffee
and just as he begins he gets a phone

00:09:33.459 --> 00:09:36.339
call: it's Sam, who reveals that his accounts have been

00:09:36.339 --> 00:09:40.600
untouched and just as he begins to trust
Christine he realizes that she has

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:44.680
drugged him. As he loses consciousness
and collapses Christine brags that we

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:50.290
didn't know your password but we do now
Blue 2\9690D

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:51.300
Goodbye Nicky!

00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:54.850
When Nicholas wakes
 up he finds himself entombed alive in a

00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:58.449
cemetery in Mexico. He staggers around
the city until he reaches the Embassy

00:09:58.449 --> 00:10:01.689
there he sells his gold watch to the
immigration officer to escape and

00:10:01.689 --> 00:10:05.889
returns home to find his mansion sold
and most of his belongings removed. There

00:10:05.889 --> 00:10:09.339
he retrieves a hidden revolver and then
goes to the hotel where Conrad was

00:10:09.339 --> 00:10:12.550
staying at where the consiegliere tells
him that Conrad had a nervous breakdown

00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:14.740
and is now hospitalized.

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:17.199
While talking with Elizabeth of his ex-wife he sees a

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:20.560
familiar face on TV: that's Jim Feingold

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:25.200
the guy who represented CRS in their first meeting.
It turns out he's just an actor!

00:10:25.209 --> 00:10:29.649
Nicholas using this information calls
Jim's agency and finds him at the zoo

00:10:29.649 --> 00:10:34.569
and forces him to take them to the CRS's real office. There he takes Christine

00:10:34.569 --> 00:10:39.220
hostage and demands to be taken to the
leader of CRS when he's attacked by CRS

00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:42.850
guards. Nicholas takes Christine to the
roof and bars the door behind him and

00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:46.629
the CRS guards begin cutting through the
door. When Christine realizes the

00:10:46.629 --> 00:10:49.660
Nicholas's gun is not a prop she
fearfully tells Nicholas that the

00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:53.589
conspiracy is fake just another part of
The Game and that his finances are

00:10:53.589 --> 00:10:56.589
intact and that his family and friends
are waiting on the other side of the

00:10:56.589 --> 00:11:00.759
door he refuses to believe her. The
door bursts open and Nicholas shoots the

00:11:00.759 --> 00:11:06.189
first person to emerge and is shocked to
find it's Conrad who dies and everyone

00:11:06.189 --> 00:11:11.440
are shocked and with all hope lost
he jumps off the roof. Just like his

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:12.300
father.

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:15.670
Nicholas's life flashes before
his eyes as he falls and he smashes for the

00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:19.510
roof but lands on a giant air mat. EMTs
carefully remove him and he finds

00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:24.260
himself in a ballroom full of his
friends, family, and every person involved in his game

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:27.190
Conrad is alive and explains
that he started the game to get his

00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:31.510
brother to embrace life and not to end
up like their father. Nicholas bursts

00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:35.410
into tears and begins to enjoy the party
once he's over his shock. When he sees

00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:38.920
that Christina's left the party; he
follows her outside to her cab and asks

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:42.160
her to dinner she offers to share a
coffee with him before her flight takes

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:44.480
her to her next game assignment in
Australia.

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:45.580
