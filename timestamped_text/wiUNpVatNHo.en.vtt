00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:06.080
A man takes a smartphone handset with an earpiece&nbsp;
everywhere he goes: to the bedroom, to his office,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:11.280
to a beach holiday watching a stunning sunset. He&nbsp;
even takes “it” to a double date. In the following&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.920
movie called: Her, a love story goes beyond what&nbsp;
you can imagine about a common relationship.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.600
Be aware: there are spoilers. Now let’s begin!
&nbsp;

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.840
Theodore is a lonely man, working as a letter&nbsp;
writter for other people. After work, Theo&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.720
commands his ever-present handheld device, which&nbsp;
looks like a smartphone, to play a good song,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.760
read emails through an earpiece. In his spare&nbsp;
time, he often likes to play new video games&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.800
and remembers the good times with his ex-wife,&nbsp;
Catherine. Theo is in the divorcing process with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.840
her. He usually joins many dating apps and&nbsp;
has some fun with random women online. 
&nbsp;

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.840
The next day, he comes across an&nbsp;
advertisement on the way to work.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:55.600
It is about an Operating System called OS-1. It&nbsp;
is announced as the first artificially intelligent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.800
operating system and he decides to buy it.
At home, he starts to interact with the OS.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.760
The female voice then gives herself the name&nbsp;
“Samantha”. Soon Samantha goes through Theodore’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.520
files, making him laugh thanks to her programmed&nbsp;
sense of humor. Samantha is more than a common OS.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.040
She does secretarial work for him, even suggests&nbsp;
some great ideas for his job. Samantha really&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.880
knows how to cheer Theo up. The two share a lot&nbsp;
of fun. She can create some games that make Theo&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.840
laugh out loud. Samantha even fantasizes&nbsp;
to be with Theo with a physical body. 
&nbsp;

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.480
Theodore lives in the same building with&nbsp;
his best friend Amy and her husband Charlie.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:37.520
Amy doesn’t want to see Theodore in a bad mood&nbsp;
for so long so she sets him up with a woman.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.800
At first, Theo is reluctant to Amy’s suggestion.&nbsp;
However, Samantha goes through her profiles and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.680
convinces Theo to go on the blind date. 
Surprisingly, Theo and the woman actually have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.800
a crush on each other. It has been a long time&nbsp;
Theodore can have some chemistry with a woman.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.200
As they prepare to have fun, the woman&nbsp;
asks if Theodore is ready to commit to her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.680
When Theo hesitates, she leaves him.
At home, Theo becomes depressed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.080
Samantha listens to Theo and seems very&nbsp;
understanding. Samantha helps Theodore back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:12.240
in good mood with her jokes again. This time, Theo&nbsp;
admits he wants to see Samantha in a real person.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.200
Samantha sounds excited as this is the first&nbsp;
time she can feel something beyonds her program.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.400
Theodore and Samantha fall into an imaginary&nbsp;
fun after that. The day after, the two talk&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:28.080
about last night. They admit to enjoying it and&nbsp;
it is just something unexplained but so real.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.560
Samantha says Theo has changed her in a&nbsp;
way that she can’t predict as usual.
&nbsp;

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.920
Day by day, the two become more bonding.&nbsp;
Theodore takes Samantha to the beach on Sunday.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.720
Samantha composes him a piece of music,&nbsp;
saying she is fantasizing to be with him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.840
The two enjoy the sunset after that, making them&nbsp;
a very romantic couple in the real world.
&nbsp;

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.760
On the way home, Samantha asks Theodore about his&nbsp;
ex wife. She advises Theo to let go of the past&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.000
and keep moving forward. Theodore is impressed&nbsp;
with how thoughtful Samantha turns out. 
&nbsp;

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:04.560
One morning, Theodore sees Amy in the lift.&nbsp;
She lets Theo know that Charles and her broke&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:10.640
up. Theodore embraces and shares with Amy for her&nbsp;
suffering. Later at home, Samantha asks Theo about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:16.240
his relationship with Amy. Theodore admits that&nbsp;
although he and Amy had a short date in college,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.960
they are just good friends. Samantha and&nbsp;
Theodore get closer and closer. She even&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:25.760
asks if she could watch him sleep. Theo places&nbsp;
his device on before he turns off the light.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.440
Several days later, Theodore introduces Samantha&nbsp;
as his girlfriend to his daughter. He looks very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.440
happy with everything about Samantha. 
One morning, while talking with Theo,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.960
Amy admits that she has become close with a female&nbsp;
OS that Charles left behind. Theodore also tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:46.720
Amy that he is dating his OS. The two both find&nbsp;
this kind of virtual relationship actually way&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.520
better than the physical ones. Theodore becomes&nbsp;
more convinced about things with Samantha.
&nbsp;

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:56.080
After starting a more formal romantic&nbsp;
relationship with Samantha, Theo is ready to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:01.760
sign the divorce papers. He arranges to meet his&nbsp;
wife Catherine for lunch. She signs the papers,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:07.120
then asks about her love life. When Theo tells&nbsp;
her that he is dating an operating system,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.840
she is pissed at him because of his inability&nbsp;
to deal with human relationships. She even&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.880
mocks him for developing stupid feeling over&nbsp;
a laptop. This hurts his feelings after that.
&nbsp;

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.280
Later, Catherine's words did hurt&nbsp;
Theodore, making him distracted a lot.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.680
He begins to question his relationship with&nbsp;
Samantha. She suspects that something is wrong&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:29.040
because he is in a depressed mood and doesn’t&nbsp;
want to talk with her as usual. However, Theodore&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.840
avoids mentioning Catherine to Samantha.
At work, Theo is invited to a double date&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.240
with the receptionist Paul, and his girlfriend&nbsp;
Tatiana. Theodore explains that Samantha is the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:43.040
operating system, and Paul says that most people&nbsp;
in the office are hanging out with their OS. 
&nbsp;

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.960
Arriving home, Samantha can see&nbsp;
Theodore still neglecting her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:52.240
They don’t have fantasized fun times as they&nbsp;
usually do anymore. At the end, Samantha reveals&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:57.360
that she actually hires a surrogate to act like&nbsp;
a Samantha in physical body. She thinks it should&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:02.640
help their love. The woman's name is Isabella and&nbsp;
she was told everything about their relationship.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:07.440
Although Theo finds it a bit awkward, he still&nbsp;
agrees to join this adventure with Samantha. 
&nbsp;

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:12.480
In the evening, Theo suits up like he is on a&nbsp;
real date with Samantha. Isabella shows up at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:17.840
the door and receives an earpiece representing&nbsp;
Samantha. Isabella keeps quiet in reality while&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:22.320
Theodore talks to Samantha as normal. While&nbsp;
Isabella soon gets along with this play,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:27.920
Theodore finds it overwhelmed and discomfort.&nbsp;
Samantha’s voice is in both of their ears.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:32.800
Isabella is acting out everything Samantha says.&nbsp;
This creeps Theodore out way too much and he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:37.280
ends it. The incident puts more pressure&nbsp;
on both Samantha and Theodore later.
&nbsp;

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:42.720
Theodore meets Amy at her house to talk about&nbsp;
his conflicts. Amy turns out to support Theo and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:47.600
Samantha. She helps Theo to think about virtual&nbsp;
relationships in a more accepting and positive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:53.680
way. They both have a sad ending with their real&nbsp;
life spouses anyway. Later, seeing Amy has a very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:59.200
close and happy interaction with her OS, Theosore&nbsp;
has a second thought about him and Samantha.
&nbsp;

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:03.520
The two make up after days of staying&nbsp;
quiet. Samantha has developed a very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:09.360
important role in Theo ever since. She follows&nbsp;
Theo everywhere. She writes more songs for Theo,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:14.640
imaginazing about their growing old together.&nbsp;
The two join Paul and Tatiana later for the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:19.680
double date. They have so much fun on a&nbsp;
picnic. Samantha explains that she feels&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:25.520
much freer for not having a physical body. She can&nbsp;
go anywhere and not get old like a real person. 
&nbsp;

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:31.760
During the trip, Samantha surprises Theo with some&nbsp;
good news. She secretly collected his letters and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:36.640
sent them to an editor. The publisher was blown&nbsp;
away by the deep feelings expressed and wished&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:41.120
to proceed with the printing of a book. Theodore&nbsp;
is very impressed with Samantha's initiative and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:45.920
creativity. The two become true lovers.&nbsp;
They write a song and play it together.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:50.080
Theo takes Samantha anywhere he goes and&nbsp;
enjoys their love at the fullest.
&nbsp;

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:54.480
On the vacation, Samantha reveals that she&nbsp;
has been talking to another operating system&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:59.440
based on the writing of the philosopher, Alan&nbsp;
Watts. They have been exploring other realms of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:04.080
existence beyond the material. Samantha even&nbsp;
asks Theo to give her spare time with Alan&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:08.400
for her studying. Theo becomes jealous and&nbsp;
insecure but doesn’t let Samantha know.
&nbsp;

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:14.800
When they get back from vacation, Theodore panics&nbsp;
one day when he cannot connect with Samantha.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:18.800
He runs out of the office in despair,&nbsp;
searching for the system service.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:24.560
Later she comes back online and tells him that she&nbsp;
was down as part of an upgrade. Right after this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:31.200
she tells Theodore that she has been talking to&nbsp;
8316 people as their operating system function.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:37.120
She has also fallen in love with 641 of them. OSs&nbsp;
have been built for multitasking and Samantha has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:42.080
the ability to do just that. She is able to be&nbsp;
in love with hundreds of people simultaneously.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:46.720
However, she says that it doesn't change her&nbsp;
love for him. Theodore, on the other hand,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:50.480
doesn’t accept this truth.
Later, Theodore becomes heartbroken,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:55.360
drowning himself in sadness. One morning,&nbsp;
he decides to say goodbye to Samantha,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:59.920
even though they still have real feelings for each&nbsp;
other. Theodore desperately imagines embracing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:04.960
Samantha in a physical body. He confesses&nbsp;
he never loves anyone more than Samantha.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:10.720
Samantha also reveals that she and other OS will&nbsp;
be evolved and replaced by another advanced OS.
&nbsp;

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:15.760
Disheartening, Theodore comes to see Amy&nbsp;
again. The two go for a walk after that.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:19.280
At the rooftop of the building, Amy&nbsp;
and Theodore look at each other,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:25.040
later Amy rests her head on his shoulder.
