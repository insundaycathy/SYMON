00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:01.699
Welcome to Moviecaps.

00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:07.250
Today I will show you a Biography, Crime,
Drama film from 2017, that's based on a true

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:09.369
story, titled Molly's Game.

00:00:09.369 --> 00:00:10.990
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:12.879
Watch out and take care.

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:17.509
During a competition, an ice skier dashes
downwards through a snow-covered slope.

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:21.259
Molly narrates in the background a survey
for 300 professionals about what's the worst

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:23.439
thing that could happen in sports.

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:27.661
As the screen pans showing the judges tallying
the scores of the skiing competition, Molly

00:00:27.661 --> 00:00:32.489
further narrates that one person answered,
it is placing 4th in the Olympics.

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.500
Molly is called to prepare on deck.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.680
She recounts how she has been training all
her life while being coached by her dad Larry,

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.989
who only sees achieving the goal, with complete
disregard of her well-being.

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.559
She prepares herself mentally as she stares
blankly while listening to her iPod.

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:51.239
Against all odds she made the US ski team
by her 20th birthday.

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.649
This is the champion run at Deer Valley, last
chance to make it to the Olympics.

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.030
Molly shows her splendid technique as she
glides rapidly yet smoothly down the slope.

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.199
She explains how Ironic it is that the very
same pine boughs that help skiers; hit her

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.650
skis so accurately it simply snaps the release
of her ski locks no matter how tightly bound

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:09.650
it is.

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.580
A ski detaches just before the next ramp,
sending her flying erratically in the air

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.520
landing on her head.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:16.720
She crashes.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.330
The crowd screams and gasps in tragedy.

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.910
The cameraman catches every second of it.

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:25.071
Whoever answered that the worst thing that
could happen in sports was “fourth place

00:01:25.071 --> 00:01:28.610
at the Olympics”, Molly offers a resounding
screw you.

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.330
The camera pans around the room with boxes
scattered all around showing a number of her

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:33.360
books.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.470
She is woken up by a phone call from an FBI
special agent Tomasino.

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.280
She is commanded to step out and approach
them.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.150
Molly is harshly arrested for a non-violent
crime.

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.960
Meanwhile, Molly in the present time recalls
how she appears to be irrationally angry during

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.390
her teenage years towards nothing in particular.

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.630
Eventually, she finds work as a waitress at
a fancy club in Los Angeles where she gets

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.470
to see the rich and famous.

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.700
She exhibits wit and astute behavior to convince
people to spend more.

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.540
Molly eventually works for Dean Keith, whom
she met in the club.

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.660
Dean starts using Molly to organize poker
games for the rich and famous.

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:14.109
Molly prepares the room, welcomes the players,
and takes from each of them $10,000 in cash.

00:02:14.109 --> 00:02:18.930
This is where she meets Player X, who will
play a very significant role in Molly's life.

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.280
As the game transpires; Molly prepares the
drinks.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:28.010
She sits in a corner realizing she just counted
off $90,000 with a room full of movie stars,

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.680
directors, rappers, boxers, and business Titans
who had complete disregard of all the money

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.890
they were burning through playing cards.

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.810
In a single night Molly realized that she
had just found herself stuck between a rock

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:44.730
and a hard place, earning $3000 in tips and
the opposite path of a successful law degree.

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.170
In the meantime, Molly waits patiently on
the couch of a posh law office where she meets

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.040
Stella, Daughter of Charlie Jaffey, her would-be
attorney.

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.920
Charlie is reluctant about accepting Molly
as a client but subsequently finds himself

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.209
in a stalemate, so he agrees to represent
her only as a representative of a potential

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:03.659
but different future lawyer.

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:07.280
Following the last game at the cobra lounge,
Player X is highlighted.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.569
Demonstrating his immense skill at poker;
hence the survivability of the game will entirely

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:15.920
depend on how other poker players would always
want to play with player X.

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.900
She acquires a new place, a new ride, and
$17,000 in cash.

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.939
No rush for law school.

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:26.700
While Molly and Charlie enter the hall of
justice, Charlie describes how he is only

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.730
going to represent her as a substitute lawyer.

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.069
Charlie is tense about something; so much
so that he keeps switching seats with the

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:35.420
security seated next to Molly.

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.310
Judge Foxman slowly calls on the defendants
queued inside the courtroom.

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:43.930
As their turn approaches, Charlie changes
his mind because of Molly's noble heart.

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.180
Charlie asserts he is her counsel.

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.250
During her teenage years, Molly recalls how
her younger brothers have already shown signs

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.090
of superior intellect and athleticism.

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.709
Molly thinks highly of herself but doesn't
understand why she always baits her father

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:59.069
into a fight even during dinner time.

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:03.209
Molly criticizes her father but ends up failing
when she gets shut down by his firm tone to

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:05.810
show respect or start living on her own.

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:10.329
Soon, in Los Angeles, she had already saved
enough and has done her part to keep her way

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:11.959
of living afloat.

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:13.659
Dean loses to Player X.

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:17.370
He takes it out on Molly by confronting her
and telling her that she is no longer going

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.780
to be paid as his executive assistant.

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:22.740
All her arguments to defend her rights fail.

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.320
Molly is not about to let this happen; she
uses her life savings to round up a venue,

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:32.000
set up the table, organize a menu, prepare
the drinks and cigars, and glamorize herself

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.870
in preparation for what she expects is going
to be the replacement game-night before Dean

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:37.120
fires her.

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.320
Molly gets fired
The following morning, she arrives at Dean's

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.680
office only to be welcomed by Leah, her replacement.

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.900
She flat out lies and texted Leah with phony
contact information about the game.

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.870
She arrives at The Four Seasons Hotel after
gathering the players for tonight.

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:55.110
She walks in the middle of the room with a
stunning outfit to tell everyone that she

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.690
will now be hosting the games herself.

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:01.780
Molly narrates how the players' egos are fed
by winning, together with the feeling of obliterating

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:03.200
opponents.

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.760
Molly asks Jay for a minute of his time.

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:10.350
Player X is seen wondering in slight jealousy
or perhaps envy as to why Jay had to be isolated

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:11.810
by Molly.

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:15.950
Molly talks to Jay alone to explain how an
international Rockstar like him can eventually

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:19.600
end up a bottom feeder if he continues to
flirt with Molly.

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:23.010
Player X discusses with Molly how they should
raise the stakes.

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:25.850
Molly counters that too much money isn't feasible.

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:27.970
Player X wants competition.

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:31.560
Donnie Silverman is invited because he can
easily lose to Player X.

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.780
He establishes his dominance because he doesn't
really enjoy the game but enjoys wiping out

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:36.970
the competition.

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:42.080
Brad Marion is invited because a player vouched
for him, the worst poker player to ever live.

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.400
Harlan Eustice is a dark horse invited by
Player X.

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:49.880
This time, back in Charlie's office, Charlie
explains how three groups of Russian mafias

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:54.000
are all tied to her because they all play
in her games and that she violated the constitution

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.230
by taking a part of the pot money.

00:05:56.230 --> 00:06:00.890
They engage in a debate on why Molly has to
hand over her hard drives to Charlie.

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:05.590
Charlie Ultimately convinces her that he can
be trusted by giving his phone as leverage.

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:10.060
So far in Los Angeles, Molly narrates how
Harlan played so well in the beginning until

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:13.850
he got demolished by the worst player in the
game, Brad Marion.

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:18.140
He didn't lose much, but he couldn't get over
it and goes on tilt and starts a massive losing

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:19.140
streak.

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:22.860
At that point the whole LA knew that unbeatable
Harlan is bleeding and everyone wanted to

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:24.470
get in on the action.

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:25.760
He keeps rebuying.

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:29.530
Molly, assuming he has money, puts it on his
tab.

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:35.120
In his final hand Harlan loses a massive pot
of $750000 against a royalty and snaps at

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:40.350
the dealer, he later confesses that he doesn't
have the $1.2 million to pay Molly.

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:43.990
Player X reveals that he has been staking
Harlan and was the same person who loaned

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:46.360
him the $1.2 million.

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:50.740
They eventually get into an unpleasant argument
when Player X, out of jealousy, gets infuriated.

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:55.630
The following night, Player X has taken the
game from her.

00:06:55.630 --> 00:07:00.340
Finally in Los Angeles, in one fleeting moment
as she sits inside her room, she realizes

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:02.820
that staying a loser wasn't going to cut it.

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:05.690
She decides to go to New York and start fresh.

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:10.520
Initially in New York, Molly recruits talented
and well-connected Playboy playmates to start

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.910
a ruse that Molly is now in town.

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:15.830
She plots a scheme baiting the upper class
of the Big Apple.

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:20.830
The poker game ensues as Molly describes her
earnings close to $5 million, all obtained

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:21.830
legally.

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:25.990
Her latest card dealer, B, convinces her to
eventually take a portion of the pot money

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:29.810
because of an incident where a player cheated
on her, and that’s on top of the money owed

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:32.700
to her by players that could no longer be
found.

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:37.720
She gives in to B’s suggestion in one high
stakes game where the pot amounted to $3 million.

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:40.090
She is now violating the law.

00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:44.770
Douglas Downey, a regular and drunkard, eventually
loses and does not have the money to pay for

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:45.770
it.

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:49.920
Molly uses Doug to invite the big time Russian
poker players from Brooklyn.

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:51.320
She succeeds.

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:57.780
Mike Davidoff, Ilya and Alexi Gershen, Shelby
Habib are business magnates in their own fields.

00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:00.890
They make the game more interesting but lose
nevertheless.

00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:05.010
Molly narrates that there was no way to tell
these gentlemen had deep dark secrets.

00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:09.790
Moreover, in Charlie’s office, Molly waits
in sentimental silence.

00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:12.930
Charlie arrives with the bad news that his
plan failed.

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:15.950
Charlie settles down and asks Molly about
her father.

00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:19.390
Molly admits that she had a lot of pressure
from her dad, but nothing compared to how

00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:20.990
tough she was on him.

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:25.230
In one swift pitch that Charlie couldn't intervene;
Molly says she will tell everything they need

00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:27.520
to know about her but only about her.

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:29.280
Charlie surrenders.

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:33.779
Back in her New York heyday, Pat, her driver
and security drives her home.

00:08:33.779 --> 00:08:38.029
Molly narrates how she liked Pat because she
could open up to him and receive no judgment.

00:08:38.029 --> 00:08:42.100
Pat asks her a favor to meet a couple of hedge
fund guys; whom she agrees to meet at the

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:43.909
Four Seasons bar.

00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:48.709
She could immediately tell that these two
men, Paul and John G. were barbaric debt collectors

00:08:48.709 --> 00:08:51.300
who urged her to hire them, but she declined.

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:54.730
Her doorman tricks Molly into believing that
he has a package for her.

00:08:54.730 --> 00:09:00.260
A man knocks on her door, roughs her up, smashes
her head to the wall, takes her money, jewelry,

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:01.339
and gold.

00:09:01.339 --> 00:09:05.939
The man threatens to kill her mother in Telluride
Colorado, as he explains that rejecting Paul

00:09:05.939 --> 00:09:08.320
and John G was a bad idea.

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:12.399
Molly is on the floor swollen and beaten up,
with a final kick to the stomach Molly passes

00:09:12.399 --> 00:09:15.629
out as the perp leaves with a bag full of
cash.

00:09:15.629 --> 00:09:19.870
After two weeks of recuperating, in preparation
for the next set of games, she receives a

00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:23.550
call from a drunk Douglas letting her know
that he would never rat her out.

00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:27.399
During the phone conversation she receives
a text message from her other phone, warning

00:09:27.399 --> 00:09:30.639
her to stay away because the FBI have stormed
her venue.

00:09:30.639 --> 00:09:32.750
She panics and rushes to depart.

00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:38.490
Later, Molly is with Charlie inside a conference
room being interrogated by two prosecutors.

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:40.769
Henderson Wellstone, and another.

00:09:40.769 --> 00:09:44.639
She answers their questions patiently while
Charlie is obviously losing patience after

00:09:44.639 --> 00:09:48.300
five hours of unsuccessful persuasion with
the prosecutors.

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:52.249
They pressure Molly to cooperate and stand
as a witness against the Russian mob.

00:09:52.249 --> 00:09:56.139
To catch her off guard, Henderson recites
the number of times her name is mentioned

00:09:56.139 --> 00:09:58.660
from Mike Davidoff’s wiretaps.

00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:03.149
Charlie sneers at the prosecutor after Molly
explains that they were referring to ecstasy.

00:10:03.149 --> 00:10:07.769
This triggers Charlie to go into a frenzied,
ferocious, and relentless declamation enumerating

00:10:07.769 --> 00:10:12.000
the various reasons Molly could have taken
advantage of, after being wrongfully harassed

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.999
by the US authorities, yet she remains vigilant
to protect all the identities she knew, because

00:10:16.999 --> 00:10:21.269
all accusations painted by the media and the
government bear zero weight on the truth;

00:10:21.269 --> 00:10:24.339
all of which can be proven by the hard drives
he possesses.

00:10:24.339 --> 00:10:27.920
Henderson abandons aggression and requests
a private talk with Charlie.

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:32.459
He instructs Molly to grab a bite
Molly steps outside sentimental, she finds

00:10:32.459 --> 00:10:34.040
an ice-skating rink.

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:37.660
She skates swiftly past the marshals who warn
her to slow down.

00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:41.459
She skates faster and faster until a voice
tells her to bend her knees.

00:10:41.459 --> 00:10:43.930
In a split second she looks to her left and
crashes.

00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:45.509
It’s her dad.

00:10:45.509 --> 00:10:49.300
They sit on a bench and he gives her three
years’ worth of therapy in three minutes.

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:54.240
Year one, Larry explains she chose poker over
all other fields that she could have succeeded

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:58.230
in, because subconsciously, she wanted to
control powerful men.

00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:02.380
Year two, Molly discovers the truth of why
her father was always hard on her.

00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:07.019
It was the catalyst needed so he could raise
3 remarkable achievers on a college professor’s

00:11:07.019 --> 00:11:08.019
salary.

00:11:08.019 --> 00:11:12.319
Year three, she uncovers the truth why Larry
appeared to like her brothers more over her.

00:11:12.319 --> 00:11:15.800
She had caught him cheating on her mom when
she was 5 years old and even though she had

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:20.029
no memory of it, she subconsciously knew,
which caused her to act out.

00:11:20.029 --> 00:11:23.559
The year one statement was just a distraction
to make her mad.

00:11:23.559 --> 00:11:25.069
Everything now made sense.

00:11:25.069 --> 00:11:28.410
Emotions arise, they make amends and hug each
other.

00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:31.559
Charlie waits back in his office with tension
in his face.

00:11:31.559 --> 00:11:33.189
Molly startles him.

00:11:33.189 --> 00:11:37.240
Molly kids around until Charlie interrupts
her with a new offer from the prosecutors.

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:42.220
She gets her money back plus interest and
she walks, in exchange for all her hard drives.

00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:46.339
They engage in a heated argument because Charlie
wants Molly to take the offer.

00:11:46.339 --> 00:11:50.069
Unmoved by Charlie’s convincing argument;
Molly assures Charlie that she would rather

00:11:50.069 --> 00:11:54.029
plead guilty than destroy more lives because
her name is more valuable than getting her

00:11:54.029 --> 00:11:55.509
money back.

00:11:55.509 --> 00:11:59.019
Molly and Charlie wait in the courtroom as
Judge Foxman arrives.

00:11:59.019 --> 00:12:02.740
He asks her 87 questions before he can accept
her plea.

00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:04.309
Molly pleads guilty.

00:12:04.309 --> 00:12:08.800
Judge Foxman beckons for the prosecutors to
approach and talks to them in private.

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:10.339
Molly is confused.

00:12:10.339 --> 00:12:14.750
Judge Foxman casually denounces the prosecutors’
recommendations for punishment.

00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:20.519
He sentences Molly with 200 hours of community
service, a year probation, and a $200,000

00:12:20.519 --> 00:12:21.899
fine before adjourning the court.

00:12:21.899 --> 00:12:26.189
They are seen celebrating, joking about how
nobody messes with the Blooms, and talking

00:12:26.189 --> 00:12:27.990
about Christmas miracles.

00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:32.699
During this merriment and feast, she is stung
by the hard reality that she has no idea what

00:12:32.699 --> 00:12:34.490
happens to her life next.

00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:38.509
Recalling what happened in the accident, she
slowly regains consciousness.

00:12:38.509 --> 00:12:41.470
Molly insists she's fine and asks for help
to get up.

00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:44.870
She narrates that nothing good came out of
this except for the fact that she is very

00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:45.959
hard to kill.

00:12:45.959 --> 00:12:49.769
The camera passes atop the downward slope
where she came from as she quotes Churchill

00:12:49.769 --> 00:12:54.009
for his definition of success: “The ability
to move from failure to failure with no loss

00:12:54.009 --> 00:12:55.500
of enthusiasm”.

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:59.300
The pine bough that started all this is sticking
out in the snow.

00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:00.300
The End.

00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:01.300
Thank you for watching!
