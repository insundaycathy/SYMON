00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:06.640
story recapped here today i'm going to show you&nbsp;
a drama horror sci-fi film called circle spoilers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:12.960
ahead watch out and take care a group of strangers&nbsp;
finds themselves in a dark chamber standing in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:19.600
a circle at the center they see a sphere the&nbsp;
group seems composed of a random mix of age race&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:26.560
sex gender professions and beliefs they're all&nbsp;
confused having no idea where they are or why&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.120
they're there they soon discover that touching&nbsp;
another person or stepping off their designated&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:35.760
spot will get them killed instantly they hear&nbsp;
an ominous humming that sounds like a countdown&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.960
and when it stops a person gets zapped by the&nbsp;
sphere at the center and dies they soon realize&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.760
that they are being forced to vote on who gets to&nbsp;
die their theories range everything from an alien&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.640
invasion to a secret government project or even&nbsp;
the biblical apocalypse they discover that they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.840
can use their hands to vote and that nobody in the&nbsp;
group can see who everybody is voting for to stop&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.560
the process they first try voting for a woman&nbsp;
who's already dead but it ends with one person&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:06.000
getting killed by random next they try to vote for&nbsp;
themselves but that also ends with a random person&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.840
getting killed one person a relatively young&nbsp;
college kid suggests voting for older people first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:17.280
this he rationalizes is for them not to waste&nbsp;
their time deciding who dies next so they can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.240
figure a way to stop or get out an older man says&nbsp;
he has every right to live like all of them but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.840
nobody listens so they vote for him and he dies&nbsp;
the group tries to figure out how they got there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.880
and one man tells the group he remembers being&nbsp;
stuck in a traffic jam to leave the city he says&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.200
people then started getting out of their cars and&nbsp;
running and then he recalls being pulled up and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.160
sucked into the sky he remembers waking up inside&nbsp;
some sort of ship and seeing a large number of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:48.160
bodies piled up three more older people get voted&nbsp;
off and they soon have to decide who dies next&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.720
the college kid suggests killing a 50 year old&nbsp;
woman but is met by a protest by the whole group&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.480
they reckon that without logic they'd soon get&nbsp;
to people who are 40 then 30. the college kid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:03.840
stands as ground and gets zapped next a soldier&nbsp;
suggests talking about themselves to find clues&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.720
why this is happening a lady with a hat agrees&nbsp;
saying maybe they weren't selected at random&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:14.400
and that maybe there's a reason for all this&nbsp;
a lady beth begins by sharing things about her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.640
she tells the group where she grew up where&nbsp;
she went to school her job and her family&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.400
unfortunately she still gets voted out and dies&nbsp;
they then decide not to reveal names to keep the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:30.400
process less personal another guy craig speaks&nbsp;
and introduces the woman next to him as his wife&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.400
they then try to figure out who's related&nbsp;
in the group and a black man and black woman&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.640
tell everyone they knew each other but one in the&nbsp;
group figured they were probably having an affair&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.800
another older person dies and they continue a&nbsp;
middle-aged mexican man talks next but he can't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.520
speak english some members think he should go&nbsp;
next as he can't contribute to the discussion&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:55.280
and waste time a woman steps in and says she can&nbsp;
translate a man wearing a tie and suspender says&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.680
it's a waste of time and even points out that the&nbsp;
mexican might even be an illegal immigrant but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.480
the rest of the group thinks it doesn't matter&nbsp;
he continues by saying the mexican man probably&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.960
stole jobs from americans and keeps rambling&nbsp;
about how immigration is destroying the industry&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:16.640
the asian woman dies next a police officer speaks&nbsp;
and says he recognizes the tattooed man he tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.280
the group that the tattooed man was charged with&nbsp;
domestic abuse for beating up his girlfriend&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.640
the tattooed man denies this at first but later&nbsp;
admits he then adds that he also remembers the cop&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.840
for shooting his friend when they were teenagers&nbsp;
the cop retorts back saying they were criminals&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.080
the tattooed man then says his girlfriend&nbsp;
deserved the beating and gets voted out and dies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.960
a blonde woman then suggests maybe they have&nbsp;
to figure out who is good and evil in the group&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.760
one of the members points out they can't do it as&nbsp;
the world is filled with grey not just black and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.640
white the blonde woman maintains that maybe they&nbsp;
had to kill off certain bad people for all of this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:56.160
to stop a black person suggests sarcastically&nbsp;
that they should perhaps kill black people next&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.640
the rest of the group disagrees saying they don't&nbsp;
want to bring race into the argument but the black&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.520
man says race is always considered the man wearing&nbsp;
a tie says he's just saying it so that they won't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:10.800
vote for him but he argues that the race card&nbsp;
won't help an asian man speaks up saying he's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.360
not counting how many asians are in the group&nbsp;
and says being black won't help him in the circle&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:21.120
the black man retorts telling them being black has&nbsp;
never helped him anywhere anyway the cop speaks up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.200
saying he's been sick of black people constantly&nbsp;
going on about struggling more than everyone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.840
else and saying they want things handed to them&nbsp;
everybody sees his prejudiced views and votes him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:35.120
out they then attempt to force a tie voting for&nbsp;
the person to their right forcing all of them to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:41.280
have one vote each and it still doesn't work one&nbsp;
person still dies at random one guy sees a man&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:46.480
voting for a pregnant woman and the vote ends up&nbsp;
being a tie between the pregnant girl and the man&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:51.840
and the man dies a guy later confesses that he saw&nbsp;
the man voting for the pregnant girl and he voted&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.480
him out he deduces that he probably voted for the&nbsp;
pregnant girl because the group would eventually&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:00.880
end up having to decide the last remaining person&nbsp;
alive could potentially be between the pregnant&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:05.280
woman and a little girl the group sees this and&nbsp;
some of them argue that they should kill the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.680
little girl and the pregnant woman to eliminate&nbsp;
the need for them to be the last people alive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.600
claiming they'll have an equal chance if they&nbsp;
eliminate both of them others think that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:18.000
pregnant woman and little girl should be the&nbsp;
last people to survive and decide to protect them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:24.080
they then end up staring at the soldier he gets&nbsp;
angry telling everyone he spent years risking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:29.920
his life to keep everyone safe a woman volunteers&nbsp;
to die next and a minister tries to comfort her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:35.040
saying god is watching over her a man wearing&nbsp;
black calls him out saying god doesn't exist&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:40.080
because if he does this shouldn't be happening&nbsp;
and calls everyone idiots for believing in god&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:45.120
he then ties with a woman but it's the woman who&nbsp;
gets voted out the man in black then proceeds to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:51.040
tell everyone that the blonde woman is a porn star&nbsp;
shaming her they then vote him out quickly they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:56.000
then consider people with children and families&nbsp;
the man wearing a tie quiz a woman and she tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.040
him she has a wife the man then asks the group&nbsp;
if a lesbian is worth dying for clearly trying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:06.000
to signal that homosexuals have no place in the&nbsp;
world the woman then asks him if he thinks she's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.360
the only homosexual in the group the man then gets&nbsp;
voted out they then bring up the choice of who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:16.480
would survive between the pregnant woman and the&nbsp;
little girl a man in glasses says that some people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:21.680
contribute more to society and that their decision&nbsp;
should be based on that the translator woman dies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:26.480
next and one of them points out that the mexican&nbsp;
should die next as there's no one to translate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:30.480
a man then suggests that they should team up&nbsp;
against the others who want to kill off a pregnant&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:36.240
woman and little girl the group split in two and&nbsp;
one side wants to kill the girl and pregnant woman&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:40.640
so they all have an equal chance of survival and&nbsp;
the other side wants the pregnant woman or child&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:45.760
to be the last one alive a tie happens and the guy&nbsp;
in glasses who thinks they should eliminate the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:51.280
pregnant woman and kid dies they continue arguing&nbsp;
about who they should let survive but most of them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:57.200
maintain their decisions the one armed guy then&nbsp;
dies next thinking they're losing the soldier&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:01.120
who says they should protect the girl and the&nbsp;
pregnant woman decides for their side to vote for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:06.880
the husband so the wife changes sides it works and&nbsp;
the wife and husband switch voting for the black&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:12.000
guy the bearded long-haired man then questions&nbsp;
the truthfulness of the couple being married&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.120
citing the impossibility of chance they quiz them&nbsp;
and they end up admitting they aren't married&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:22.400
the husband tells everyone to vote for the phony&nbsp;
wife but he dies instead the long-haired man who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:26.560
wants to kill the kid and pregnant woman then&nbsp;
goes around talking to everyone getting them on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:32.880
his side again but a five-way tie happens between&nbsp;
the alleged actress lesbian soldier a lady with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:38.400
a hat and a long-haired man the long-haired&nbsp;
man miraculously wins the tie after another&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:43.760
man sacrifices himself refusing to vote and only&nbsp;
six remain they decide to tie the phony wife and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:49.360
the kid but a middle-aged man doesn't vote and the&nbsp;
phony wife dies they realize that the middle-aged&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:54.640
man has never voted a single time the long-haired&nbsp;
man is determined to kill the middle-aged man but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:59.040
he doesn't notice the other man signaling the&nbsp;
pregnant woman to vote for the long-haired man&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:04.320
the long-haired man realizes it but it's too&nbsp;
late and he dies the remaining are left with no&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:10.720
choice but to vote for the middle-aged man three&nbsp;
people a guy the pregnant woman and a little girl&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:15.280
remain they then contemplate the implications&nbsp;
and why they are being put through all of this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:20.560
the guy theorizes that the aliens probably want&nbsp;
to learn about humanity and our morals and ethics&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:24.960
the guy then says that somebody will have to&nbsp;
step off their spot once he dies and that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:30.560
two remaining girls will decide the little girl&nbsp;
volunteers to sacrifice herself for the baby&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:35.040
he tells the little girl katie that&nbsp;
they'll both step off the platform together&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:39.680
as katie steps off the guy quickly moves&nbsp;
his hand and votes the pregnant girl out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:44.960
the girls die and the guy remains he sees the&nbsp;
baby still consider the baby inside the pregnant&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:49.920
woman as part of the decision and he doesn't&nbsp;
hesitate to vote for the baby the guy awakens&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:55.200
outside and sees a group of random people who are&nbsp;
probably also survivors of their circles he joins&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:55.200 --> 00:09:00.000
them and they all stare off at a distance where&nbsp;
they see a giant flying disc lifting into the sky&nbsp;&nbsp;
