00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:25.840
creature close by so he tells them to run toward&nbsp;
the truck the father stays behind to protect them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:31.920
suddenly the creature appears and before he can&nbsp;
hit it throws him on the side the boy screams&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:36.480
as the mother is seeing it all play out on the&nbsp;
monitors the creature follows the scream and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:41.360
attacks the truck but fortunately the father&nbsp;
is still alive he sees that the children are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:46.400
defenseless inside of the vehicle and after saying&nbsp;
goodbye screams to attract the attention of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:51.440
creature the boy pushes the truck into gear and&nbsp;
as it rolls away the creature gets to the father&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:56.720
as dusk breaks the children are reunited with&nbsp;
their mother but the creature has followed them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:01.520
she takes the children to the basement and the&nbsp;
daughter sees what the father has been working on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:11.360
the creature has found them and as it's coming&nbsp;
down the mother aims at it with a shotgun all the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:16.240
electronics glitch and disturb the creature the&nbsp;
daughter figures out that devices like her hearing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:21.280
aid are its weakness and she turns hers on before&nbsp;
the creature can get to the newborn crying the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:26.480
girl puts her aid to the radio and incapacitates&nbsp;
it a second later it rises but the mother shoots&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:31.920
it dead the lights start flickering again they&nbsp;
see on the monitors that more creatures are coming&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:36.800
