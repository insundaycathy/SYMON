00:00:50.184 --> 00:00:52.749
and her husband is named Steven.

00:00:52.749 --> 00:00:54.909
they are getting ready to attend a party,

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:57.149
Emily doesn't seem to like her husband,

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.974
because she doesn't love him. when they arrives at the party, they are greeted by important people.

00:01:02.974 --> 00:01:06.880
in the party, Emily also sees her mistress named David.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.726
then she signals to him that her husband is here.

00:01:09.726 --> 00:01:14.587
when her husband is busy talking. Emily goes to see David and going to kiss him.

00:01:14.587 --> 00:01:17.847
Suddenly, Steven comes and surprises them.

00:01:17.847 --> 00:01:21.632
Emily who is shocked, immediately introduces David to her husband.

00:01:21.632 --> 00:01:26.496
Emily says that David is a talented painter who had studied art at a well-known faculty.

00:01:26.496 --> 00:01:32.086
So Steven is interested and asks for David's phone number,
maybe he is interested to buy some painting.

00:01:32.086 --> 00:01:39.157
The next day, Emily comes to visit David's house, David is enjoying her bottom cave until Emily feels satisfied.

00:01:39.157 --> 00:01:45.785
On the other hand, Steven gets into a problem where his stock investment decreases which makes his company lose a lot.

00:01:45.785 --> 00:01:48.974
back to Emily, when She is making love with David,

00:01:48.974 --> 00:01:52.683
suddenly, Steven calls David, They are very shocked.

00:01:52.683 --> 00:01:55.290
It turns out that Steven wants to meet with David.

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.693
When David meets Steven at the bar,

00:01:57.693 --> 00:02:00.881
Steven accidentally drops a white envelope on his chair,

00:02:00.881 --> 00:02:03.716
so what's in the envelope? we don't know yet.

00:02:03.716 --> 00:02:07.737
Then David takes Steven to his house which looks shabby and uninhabitable.

00:02:07.737 --> 00:02:09.927
When Steven sees David's painting,

00:02:09.927 --> 00:02:12.627
He immediately insults David's painting.

00:02:12.627 --> 00:02:16.199
David is confused about why Steven insulted his painting ?

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:20.900
even Steven bluntly says that David's house was really ugly because it didn't have a seat.

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.946
There is also Emily's wedding ring which she forgot,

00:02:23.946 --> 00:02:27.040
so Steven is even more sure about his wife's infidelity.

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.052
Steven also says that he was jealous of David's affair with his wife.

00:02:31.052 --> 00:02:33.859
David replies by saying that he loved Emily,

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:40.841
This makes Steven even angrier and reveals all David's secrets Where David lies that he was an art graduate at a well-known faculty,

00:02:40.841 --> 00:02:44.080
it turns out that his painting skills he got while in prison.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:49.006
David also cheated on a widow in San Francisco and currently David is still a fugitive.

00:02:49.006 --> 00:02:54.213
Now Steven offers David 500,000 dollars on the condition that David has to kill Emily,

00:02:54.213 --> 00:02:56.611
at first, David refuses it,

00:02:56.611 --> 00:02:59.449
but he is threatened by Steven with reporting to the police,

00:02:59.449 --> 00:03:02.017
because David does not want to go back to prison,

00:03:02.017 --> 00:03:03.749
so he accepts the offer,

00:03:03.749 --> 00:03:08.380
Steven also tells all his plans so David can easily enter his house to kill Emily.

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.354
So here the question arises,

00:03:10.354 --> 00:03:13.899
why does Steven want to kill his wife?

00:03:13.899 --> 00:03:20.134
Then Steven returns home and puts the white envelope which turns out to contain a photo of David and Emily's affair,

00:03:20.134 --> 00:03:22.689
the letter is made as if it is sent by David,

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:24.500
Damn Steven is really cunning.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.510
on the other hand, Emily meets her friend at a bar,

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.636
she says that she didn't love Steven,

00:03:29.636 --> 00:03:31.869
so she wants a divorce and tells her affair.

00:03:31.869 --> 00:03:36.064
Here Emily realizes that her wedding ring was left at David's house.

00:03:36.064 --> 00:03:41.252
When Emily comes home, Steven says that he had come to David's house and made a deal with him,

00:03:41.252 --> 00:03:43.977
Emily is confused and curious about the deal.

00:03:43.977 --> 00:03:47.182
The next day, Emily immediately calls David,

00:03:47.182 --> 00:03:50.780
and asks him about the deal, but David doesn't want to tell her.

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.823
David instead changes the topic by taking Emily to lunch the next day.

00:03:54.823 --> 00:04:00.124
After that, David goes to Steven's house which looks luxurious with expensive things.

00:04:00.124 --> 00:04:02.755
Steven explains his plan to kill Emily,

00:04:02.755 --> 00:04:06.520
From how to get in the entrance,
until how to unlock the house.

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.864
At first, David isn't sure that the plan would work,

00:04:09.864 --> 00:04:13.885
but Steven convinces David by paying him 100,000 dollars first,

00:04:13.885 --> 00:04:18.363
if David succeeds, the 400,000 dollars will also belong to David,

00:04:18.363 --> 00:04:20.589
David is excited to see that much money.

00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:24.704
The next day, when Emily wants to keep her lunch appointment with David.

00:04:24.704 --> 00:04:29.580
Suddenly, he meets Steven on the street, Steven also invites her to lunch.

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:34.579
After lunch, David sees Emily with his husband whereas David is waiting for her,

00:04:34.579 --> 00:04:37.815
David becomes jealous and destroys Emily's face painting.

00:04:37.815 --> 00:04:42.866
Suddenly, Emily calls him and says that she wanted to tell Steven about their affair.

00:04:42.866 --> 00:04:46.989
When she comes home from work, Emily puts the key in the place as usual,

00:04:46.989 --> 00:04:49.494
then she approaches Steven to ask him to talk,

00:04:49.494 --> 00:04:51.255
Emily wants to be honest,

00:04:51.255 --> 00:04:53.401
but Steven refuses on the grounds,

00:04:53.401 --> 00:04:55.996
that he was going to play cards with his business friend.

00:04:55.996 --> 00:04:57.814
Emily goes into the room,

00:04:57.814 --> 00:05:00.651
Steven takes the key that Emily had placed earlier,

00:05:00.651 --> 00:05:04.941
then keeps it under the pipe so that later David can enter the house.

00:05:04.941 --> 00:05:10.379
Steven also says goodbye to Emily, as if his wife will die by saying goodbye.

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:14.210
When Steven leaves the house, a masked man enters his house.

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:22.110
While Emily is getting ready to take a shower, then the masked man takes the key and goes straight into the house.

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:27.318
On the other hand, Steven is waiting for 10 o'clock.
at exactly 10 o'clock,

00:05:27.318 --> 00:05:32.004
he makes an automatic call to his house.
Emily who hears the phone keeps ringing,

00:05:32.004 --> 00:05:33.418
She goes to pick it up,

00:05:33.418 --> 00:05:35.495
suddenly the masked man attacks her.

00:05:35.495 --> 00:05:37.900
Emily is strangled almost to death,

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.125
she tries to fight but fails.

00:05:40.125 --> 00:05:42.566
Emily doesn't want to give up so easily,

00:05:42.566 --> 00:05:44.665
she takes the meat thermometer immediately,

00:05:44.665 --> 00:05:47.168
then she stabs the masked man's neck.

00:05:47.168 --> 00:05:52.436
Emily who is shocked because she has killed someone,
finally she faints.

00:05:52.436 --> 00:05:57.397
Steven thinks that Emily is already dead, so he resumes his card game.

00:05:57.397 --> 00:06:02.084
When Steven comes home, he is shocked to see a lot of blood and Emily is still alive.

00:06:02.084 --> 00:06:04.790
Steven sees the body in the kitchen immediately,

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:07.851
he uses gloves then takes the key in the man's pocket,

00:06:07.851 --> 00:06:09.894
he puts it back into Emily's key.

00:06:09.894 --> 00:06:16.527
after that, the police come and ask Emily. Emily says that she only took calls, then someone was coming.

00:06:16.527 --> 00:06:23.104
After that, the detective asks Steven a question, because the detective sees Steven's footprints near the body.

00:06:23.104 --> 00:06:26.790
Steven answers him nervously, so the detective suspects him.

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:31.289
When the mask is opened, it turns out that it wasn't David, but someone else.

00:06:31.289 --> 00:06:37.869
Steven is very surprised, then Steven hugs Emily, so the police don't suspect him.

00:06:37.869 --> 00:06:42.744
when the black bag is brought out, David looks sad because he thinks Emily is dead.

00:06:42.744 --> 00:06:47.198
because of the trauma, Emily wants to stay at her mother's house temporarily.

00:06:47.198 --> 00:06:53.024
Steven asks Emily to sleep, but instead of sleeping, Emily calls David who is frustrated,

00:06:53.024 --> 00:06:58.861
David doesn't have time to pick it up, and instantly David is excited again after knowing that Emily was still alive,

00:06:58.861 --> 00:07:01.709
when he re-calling her, it’s Steven who picks it up.

00:07:03.905 --> 00:07:08.917
Then David and Steven are meeting somewhere, Steven feels that David was playing a joke with him,

00:07:08.917 --> 00:07:12.695
because David hired someone to kill Emily, why not himself?

00:07:12.695 --> 00:07:17.047
David asks what is the next plan, but Steven doesn't want to tell his plan,

00:07:17.047 --> 00:07:23.312
Emily who is feeling better, comes back to her house, but it turns out that she can't enter because her house key doesn't match,

00:07:23.312 --> 00:07:29.082
so she asks the receptionist for a spare key, she also asks, Does Steven has changed her house key?

00:07:29.082 --> 00:07:31.359
the receptionist says, no,

00:07:31.359 --> 00:07:37.325
Emily comes in and sees her house, suddenly Steven comes, which make Emily very surprised,

00:07:37.325 --> 00:07:40.560
then Emily says that she no longer wanted to live with Steven.

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:43.504
In the present, Emily lives at her friend's house,

00:07:43.504 --> 00:07:46.139
In the house, they discuss about her marriage,

00:07:46.139 --> 00:07:48.621
So Emily is a woman who is very rich,

00:07:48.621 --> 00:07:51.005
She has a wealth of 100 million dollars,

00:07:51.005 --> 00:07:54.617
which is if Emily dies then her wealth will be inherited by her husband,

00:07:54.617 --> 00:07:58.830
But Emily's husband is also rich, so Emily doesn't suspect her husband,

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:03.086
The next day, Emily is told that her husband is in danger of going bankrupt,

00:08:03.086 --> 00:08:05.489
because of his messy stock investment,

00:08:05.489 --> 00:08:09.454
Now, Emily becomes suspicious that her husband is the one who wants to kill her,

00:08:09.454 --> 00:08:12.643
He also goes to the detective who takes care of the case,

00:08:12.643 --> 00:08:16.068
She gets the address of the masked man,

00:08:16.068 --> 00:08:19.094
Emily rushes to the masked man's apartment immediately,

00:08:19.094 --> 00:08:23.339
In the apartment, Emily is very surprised because of the key she had,

00:08:23.339 --> 00:08:25.031
can open the door of the apartment,

00:08:25.031 --> 00:08:27.753
so it turns out that the key that Steven took that night,

00:08:27.753 --> 00:08:29.666
it was the key from the masked man.

00:08:29.666 --> 00:08:35.074
on the other hand, David meets with Steven and asks for the remaining 400,000 dollars,

00:08:35.074 --> 00:08:39.202
otherwise he will distribute the sound recording of Emily's assassination plot,

00:08:39.202 --> 00:08:44.410
Well, to be safe, Steven agrees to give the remaining 400,000 dollars.

00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:49.762
when Steven and Emily meet, she asks Steven that why the killer's key was in my lock string?

00:08:49.762 --> 00:08:52.620
Steven gives her a photo of her affair immediately.

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:55.809
Steven also lies and makes up a story for Emily.

00:08:55.809 --> 00:08:59.906
He says that David asked him for money to break his relationship with Emily.

00:08:59.906 --> 00:09:03.022
Steven also says that David lied about himself,

00:09:03.022 --> 00:09:07.091
David is a fugitive from the police and just wants to take Emily's property.

00:09:07.091 --> 00:09:10.774
After Hearing that, Emily regrets and apologizes to Steven,

00:09:10.774 --> 00:09:12.858
Wow, Steven is really cunning.

00:09:12.858 --> 00:09:16.664
Steven goes to bring 400,000 dollars to David's house,

00:09:16.664 --> 00:09:19.574
but there David only left a note and Emily's ring.

00:09:19.574 --> 00:09:22.214
The note then takes Steven to a place.

00:09:22.214 --> 00:09:26.485
When Steven meets David, he gives David 400,000 dollars.

00:09:26.485 --> 00:09:29.939
David runs away immediately as far as possible by train,

00:09:29.939 --> 00:09:32.959
but it turns out that Steven was really sneaky,

00:09:32.959 --> 00:09:35.877
he already knew that David booked a ticket to Canada,

00:09:35.877 --> 00:09:39.032
so suddenly Steven appears and kills David,

00:09:39.032 --> 00:09:40.919
and then he takes the money back,

00:09:40.919 --> 00:09:45.956
there he also finds that David had sent a voice recording his assassination plan.

00:09:45.956 --> 00:09:49.608
Steven is very panicked and rushes home.

00:09:49.608 --> 00:09:53.546
Fortunately, Emily has not had time to check the mail,

00:09:53.546 --> 00:09:58.089
finally Steven takes the tape and puts it in the safe along with the 400,000 dollars.

00:09:58.089 --> 00:10:01.125
Emily realizes that Steven was already home,

00:10:01.125 --> 00:10:03.592
Steven feels very relieved now.

00:10:03.592 --> 00:10:05.343
When Steven goes to the bathroom,

00:10:05.343 --> 00:10:09.332
Emily sees the bag that should have been given to David

00:10:09.332 --> 00:10:14.293
Emily also tells Steven that she wanted to change the house key because she couldn't find the key.

00:10:14.293 --> 00:10:20.494
Steven is surprised by what Emily said, So Steven takes the key in the pipe and intends to return the key again,

00:10:20.494 --> 00:10:22.911
but Steven is caught,

00:10:22.911 --> 00:10:25.924
Emily plays Steven's voice recording immediately,

00:10:25.924 --> 00:10:29.977
so now it is revealed that Steven had planned to kill Emily.

00:10:29.977 --> 00:10:33.222
Emily tries to run away but Steven blocks it,

00:10:33.222 --> 00:10:35.795
Steven is annoyed then slams Emily,

00:10:35.795 --> 00:10:40.646
and until finally Steven dies because he is shot by Emily.

00:10:40.646 --> 00:10:44.110
so Emily gets the gun and the tape from Steven's safe box.

00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:49.952
And when the detective comes, Emily plays the tape then explains what happened during the fight with Steven,

00:10:49.952 --> 00:10:52.684
the detective says "What else can you do?"

00:10:52.684 --> 00:10:55.371
which means Emily is not guilty of this murder

00:10:55.371 --> 00:10:57.402
and the movie of a perfect murder is,

00:10:57.402 --> 00:10:58.891
