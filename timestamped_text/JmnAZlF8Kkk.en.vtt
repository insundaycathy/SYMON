00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.510
Detective Recapped here.

00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:05.200
Today, I'm going to explain a sci-fi thriller
film called "Archive."

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.569
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:07.770
Watch out and take care.

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:14.100
In 2038, a scientist named George Almore is
designated in Japan, working and living alone

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.289
in the middle of a forest at a massive Artisan
Robotics compound.

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:24.840
His only companions are his two robotic creations,
J1 and J2, who also serve as his helpers.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.900
The second prototype, J2, watches her favorite
cartoon and tells George about a dream she

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.460
had of them driving a car.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.400
She doesn’t remember much of the dream,
but she tells him that she felt sad when she

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.400
woke up.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.440
J2 also informs him that someone wants to
talk to him.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.530
George seems to know who she’s talking about.

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.730
Later that day, George talks to a woman named
Jules Almore, who happens to be his wife.

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.420
While they are having the conversation, Jules
has a hard expression on her face.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.080
She tells him that she can’t talk to him
anymore, and she hopes that he’s happy there.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.750
The signal weakens, and Jules bids him goodbye.

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.370
George remains baffled for a couple of minutes,
and then he suddenly finds himself in an autonomous

00:00:58.370 --> 00:00:59.370
car with Jules.

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.559
They get into a playful mood, and Jules asks
him to set the car in self-driving mode.

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:06.880
George disapproves, saying that he doesn’t
trust the car’s automatic driving feature

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.430
since he didn’t design it.

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.500
Meanwhile, at present, George is on a call
with his boss, Simone.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.750
She notices that it has been two years, and
he still hasn’t shown them anything except

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.000
for two unsuccessful robots, referring to
J1 and J2 as “two horrible things.”

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.790
She reminds him that he only has three years
to develop and finish his research.

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.640
Simone ends the call by ordering George to
back up the system and secure the place.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.250
After the call, George and J2 share their
sentiments towards his boss.

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.810
He tells J2 that it’s better if they limit
Simone’s knowledge about the two prototypes,

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.390
or else she’ll have them shut down.

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.780
J2 agrees and reassures J1 that she isn’t
horrible, contrary to what the boss said.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.670
A little while later, George continues work
while a video memory of his wife plays in

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:46.780
the background.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.150
He is working on another prototype, which
he names J3.

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.740
J3 looks vastly different from J1 and J2,
and she is the only one to have an actual

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.000
human form.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.210
Unbeknownst to George, J2 peeks through his
laboratory to see what he is up to.

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.210
When George and J2 go out to fix their reception
system, he notices that J2 is unusually quiet.

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.230
She then asks him why he won’t let her help
him with his work, reminding him that they

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:09.840
used to be a team.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.460
George reassures her that he’s not replacing
her with the new prototype.

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:16.760
J2 still feels unsure, seeing that the new
robot is similar to her but only better.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.980
However, she notices a pattern and realizes
that she’s better when compared to her sister,

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:21.980
J1.

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.270
George tries to escape the conversation and
orders J2 to get back to the house since it’s

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.580
cold outside and the prototype might get wet.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.160
George returns to his station to continue
assembling his third prototype.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.940
He successfully installs the artificial intelligence
into her brain, but her system cannot fully

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.610
process it yet as she is suddenly able to
recollect Jules’s memories as well.

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.860
George comforts her and puts her into hibernation
to adjust and help her feel better once she

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.270
wakes up.

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.980
When George heads out the next morning, he’s
surprised to see a dog at their entrance.

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.930
He sends the dog away and voice commands their
system to shut the entrance.

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.160
Unfortunately, it doesn’t work.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.850
J2 pretends that she knows nothing about it,
but she seems delighted when George asks for

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:57.100
her help.

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.410
George and J2 are fixing the system outside
when a vehicle stops.

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:07.330
Mr. Sinclair and Mr. Melvin, who are representatives
of the Archive company, approach them.

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.570
George immediately commands J1 and J2 to stay
in their station until the visitors are gone.

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:14.690
The two have come to inform George that they
received the notifications of his wife’s

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:15.819
transition to somnolence.

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:18.660
They also want to check the condition of the
archive machine for their client, George’s

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:19.660
remaining optimal usage.

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.030
Mr. Sinclair casually talks to him, but George
seems distracted by Mr. Melvin’s operation

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:24.270
on the machine.

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.740
Mr. Melvin finds out that someone patched
the security seals and the environmental systems

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:31.000
of the unit, but George reluctantly denies
it and asks him to recheck the system for

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.160
errors.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.250
Mr. Melvin grows suspicious and reminds George
that the home use of the archive legally constitutes

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.570
storage of the deceased user's remains.

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:41.770
Once it is used for personal reasons, they
have a legal obligation to remove the unit

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:43.560
and prepare it for burial.

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.290
George causes an outburst as he doesn’t
want his wife to leave yet.

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.160
However, Mr. Melvin warns him that they are
obliged to act under the Post Death Internment

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.240
Act with force if they find out that he acting
against the rules.

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:56.120
George claims that he has never done anything
wrong and that the archive company can't do

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.130
anything because they don't have proof.

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:01.620
When they leave, George knows they'll quickly
find evidence, so he works around the clock

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.490
to finish J3.

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:06.380
George returns to his station to examine J3’s
condition.

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:09.690
He puts off the hibernation mode and brings
J3 back to her senses.

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.210
However, she seems upset and tired.

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:15.220
George comforts her and clarifies that he
did that to minimize her trauma before bringing

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:16.690
her back online.

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.500
She is confused as she cannot remember anything,
but George explains that her software is finding

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.320
patterns, and trying to piece things together.

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.840
He assures her that the process might not
be tidy, but it is working.

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.500
The following day, once J3 calms down, George
starts examining her taste buds by introducing

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.040
her to different flavors such as vanilla and
lime.

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.960
He also examines her memory by letting her
read different words.

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.130
He also takes her under the empathy test.

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:41.700
When J3 asks the point of the tests, George
simply responds that those tests will give

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.860
him a lot of information about her personality.

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:48.060
Suddenly, J3 notices the scar on George's
face, and he then reveals that he got it from

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.280
an accident.

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.341
After several more tests, George asks her
to keep talking so her throat won’t feel

00:04:52.341 --> 00:04:53.341
numb and tight.

00:04:53.341 --> 00:04:56.860
J3 then tells him that she has been dreaming
a lot lately, but she is not sure if it is

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.320
dreaming or remembering.

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.310
Eventually, J1 walks in and introduces herself
to J3.

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.340
George informs her that J1 has problems with
her mobility and that he didn’t have enough

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:09.270
time back then to fabricate her any arms,
which makes J3 ask if he is going to finish

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:10.270
her.

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:13.730
He replies that he is working on it, and hopefully,
she will be fully independent.

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:17.410
He also shows J3 their cognitive ability and
reveals that J1 stopped developing at age

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:18.790
five to six.

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:22.540
He then used it as a template for version
two, which is J2, and her brain stopped developing

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:24.450
around fifteen to sixteen years old.

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:28.630
Then, he shows her a fully functional brain
figure which is hers, unaware that J2 is watching

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:32.830
them in the CCTV, witnessing everything, including
the revelations she never knew.

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:37.330
A feeling of envy takes over her, encouraging
her to potentially sabotage J3.

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:41.330
One night, while George is sleeping, J2 destroys
the devices in the basement.

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.780
At the same time, George seems to be remembering
his wife in his dreams.

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:47.970
George shares a piece of good news with Jules,
telling her that his company is offering him

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:51.740
a three-year contract job, where he would
do three years of solid research with a deliverable

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:53.300
prototype at its end.

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:57.150
Jules seems very happy, congratulating him,
and keeps on telling him that she is so proud

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:58.150
of him.

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:01.710
However, George also tells him that he would
be in Japan if he accepts the offer, and Jules

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:05.530
seems surprised about it, then suddenly there
is an awkward silence between them.

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:08.340
George assures Jules that he will not take
it if she doesn't want him to, but there’s

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:09.840
still tension in the air.

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:13.460
All of a sudden, a car appears and crashes
straight into them, leading to a vehicular

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:14.580
accident.

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:17.380
George wakes up from the nightmare by the
loud alarm in his station.

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:20.150
He finds their window shattered, and J3 is
missing.

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:23.140
His first thought is that someone might have
stolen her, so he sneaks into the basement

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:24.610
and looks for her.

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:28.320
The next day, George still can't find J3,
but he doesn't give up.

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:32.170
He scours the entire forest with two aerial
searching devices but finds nothing.

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:33.510
Then suddenly, Jules appears.

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:37.229
They have an essential conversation about
the new technology, called archive.

00:06:37.229 --> 00:06:40.690
George explains to her that archived clients
can expect up to 200 hours of face-to-face

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:44.760
interaction with the deceased loved one.s
She asks why he wants to talk to a dead person,

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:47.280
and he replies so that he can say goodbye
properly.

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:48.940
He then adds that he misses her.

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:52.270
However, Jules seems to disagree, stating
that she doesn’t want to be trapped dead

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:53.630
in a machine.

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:56.930
Jules disappears, and George still can't find
J3.

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:59.180
George returns to the base in the late afternoon.

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:03.169
As he opens a drawer to look for another searching
device, J3 falls onto him, appearing weak

00:07:03.169 --> 00:07:05.320
and frail, and calls him a monster.

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:08.750
It takes him a while to calm her down, but
he does his best to explain to J3 what is

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:10.509
going on to gain her trust again.

00:07:10.509 --> 00:07:13.759
He tells her that he has data that the computer
managed to pull out of the archives.

00:07:13.759 --> 00:07:16.770
However, it never managed to connect to a
computer before.

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:20.590
He explains that J3's brain is not a computer,
but there is a biochemical element in it which

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:24.030
he could extract an analog signal from and
put it into a piece of pattern recognition

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:25.130
software.

00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:27.949
After one year of trials, he finally saw Jules'
signals.

00:07:27.949 --> 00:07:31.450
He then created a personality template and
then started creating a physical version,

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:34.770
which resulted in J1, then J2, now J3.

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:37.270
He assures her that he won’t make a fourth
prototype.

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:41.169
After talking for a while, he discovers that
J2 secretly brought J3 into the documents

00:07:41.169 --> 00:07:42.410
room the night before.

00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:45.780
J2 even told her that she will be George's
wife's replacement in the future and that

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:49.800
George will manufacture more advanced robots
to replace her, just as J3 has now replaced

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:50.800
J2.

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:53.470
In the end, J2 locks her in the drawer.

00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:57.950
After knowing J3’s side, George now confronts
J2, who is feeling guilty and sorry.

00:07:57.950 --> 00:08:02.169
J2 explains that she only wants J3 to know
the truth and not hurt his feelings, but George

00:08:02.169 --> 00:08:05.180
is so enraged that he turns off J2 and leaves.

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:08.320
George receives a call from Simone, telling
him that the archive company wants to talk

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:09.729
to him about his wife.

00:08:09.729 --> 00:08:13.210
The company suspects that he based the two
robots on their archive technology and that

00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:15.870
they want to take a good closer look at the
two inventions.

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:18.139
Simone assures him that their research is
confidential.

00:08:18.139 --> 00:08:21.640
However, the company is still threatening
legal actions against him.

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:24.610
She also informs him that their lawyers are
looking into the case against George since

00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:28.030
he breached his confidentiality agreement
by letting outsiders into the house, which

00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:30.000
might be grounds for termination.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.930
A few days later, George visits J2 in her
station.

00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:37.509
J2 notices something is not right with her
legs and suspects that he gave it to J3.

00:08:37.509 --> 00:08:40.789
George denies it and tells J2 that there was
technology in there that is essential for

00:08:40.789 --> 00:08:42.050
his work.

00:08:42.050 --> 00:08:45.810
On the days that J2 was shut down, George
was actually working on completing the third

00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:49.040
prototype, where he dismantled J2's legs and
modified them to be better.

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:52.800
Once they were improved, he gave them to J3
and coated her body with a white skin-like

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:53.800
medium.

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:59.529
J3 now has a complete human form; on the other
hand, J2 feels depressed, used, and worthless.

00:08:59.529 --> 00:09:03.259
She occasionally visits the waterfalls and
takes long walks, causing it to lose its power

00:09:03.259 --> 00:09:04.519
and eventually shut down.

00:09:04.519 --> 00:09:08.329
Fortunately, J1 is there to inform George
about what happened to J2.

00:09:08.329 --> 00:09:10.959
But when he examines J2, he sees no damage.

00:09:10.959 --> 00:09:14.860
J2 tells him that having no physical damage
doesn’t mean that she’s okay.

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:19.439
Feeling annoyed, George leaves and tells her
that they should talk once J2 is less dramatic.

00:09:19.439 --> 00:09:22.509
George continues hanging out with J3, and
they seem to have a good time as they are

00:09:22.509 --> 00:09:24.220
laughing and dancing together.

00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:27.990
On the other hand, J2 peeks through the wall
and sees their love growing stronger, a sight

00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:29.940
which she could not bear anymore.

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:33.100
Feeling hopeless and worthless, she goes to
J1 and pats her as if she is saying goodbye

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:34.589
for the last time.

00:09:34.589 --> 00:09:36.279
She even leaves a goodbye letter.

00:09:36.279 --> 00:09:39.550
She goes outside in the middle of terrible
weather, then suddenly, she is in front of

00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:40.550
the lake.

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:44.290
She heads down and slowly approaches the water,
causing self-damage and losing its signals

00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:46.279
until she is completely soaked.

00:09:46.279 --> 00:09:49.589
George impatiently searches everywhere until
the computer announces that it lost its connection

00:09:49.589 --> 00:09:51.079
with J2 as well.

00:09:51.079 --> 00:09:53.059
He almost collapses with the loss.

00:09:53.059 --> 00:09:56.470
Even though he cannot find her body, he buries
J2’s things and holds a funeral for her

00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:57.910
in the evening.

00:09:57.910 --> 00:10:01.529
That night, J3 has a breakthrough because
she is given a portion of Jules' memory data

00:10:01.529 --> 00:10:03.499
to feel the love between Jules and George.

00:10:03.499 --> 00:10:08.019
J3 lays on George's bed, and George mistakes
her for Jules, so he kisses her, but when

00:10:08.019 --> 00:10:12.269
he opens his eyes, he sees the person in front
of him as J3, so he kicks her out.

00:10:12.269 --> 00:10:16.089
The following day, George continues finishing
his final touches with J3.

00:10:16.089 --> 00:10:20.050
While J3 is unconscious, flashes of Jules’s
memories keep appearing in her mind, such

00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:23.930
as memories from a car accident, where a police
officer announces it needed one archive machine

00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:25.369
for a deceased person.

00:10:25.369 --> 00:10:28.290
J3 also recalls Jules being pregnant.

00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:30.970
Later that day, Simone angrily calls George.

00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:34.500
It turns out that the archive company discovered
J2 at the bottom of the lake, which is proof

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:36.600
that George stole the company's data.

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:40.860
Simone decides to fire George right away while
George turns off all of the base's systems.

00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:44.069
Because J3 believes Simone is the bad guy,
she smashes the screen with the thought of

00:10:44.069 --> 00:10:45.389
helping George.

00:10:45.389 --> 00:10:49.050
While he is away, J3 takes the call from Jules
in the archive machine and says he cannot

00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:52.290
come to the phone right now and that she will
take care of him once Jules is completely

00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:53.290
gone.

00:10:53.290 --> 00:10:56.769
On the other line, Jules seems so confused
as she doesn’t understand what J3 is trying

00:10:56.769 --> 00:10:59.999
to say, but what J3 meant is when Jules' archive
expires.

00:10:59.999 --> 00:11:03.459
George comes back, and he gets the phone from
J3 and says he cannot explain everything right

00:11:03.459 --> 00:11:06.319
now, but he reassures her that he will see
her very soon.

00:11:06.319 --> 00:11:07.899
Then, the call ends.

00:11:07.899 --> 00:11:11.829
J3 is astonished by what she has heard, and
it makes sense to her now that George is going

00:11:11.829 --> 00:11:13.689
to put Jules' archive into her.

00:11:13.689 --> 00:11:17.649
Finally, George discloses J3 that he intends
to erase her consciousness and replace it

00:11:17.649 --> 00:11:18.850
with Jules's.

00:11:18.850 --> 00:11:20.730
He tells her that it is the only way.

00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:24.980
J3, like any other living being, does not
wish to die and out of frustration, she yells

00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:26.899
at him that Jules is already dead.

00:11:26.899 --> 00:11:29.860
Suddenly, she breaks down and gets the gun
from a case.

00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:32.949
She points it at him to interrogate him more
about what is really happening and what the

00:11:32.949 --> 00:11:34.189
archive company wants.

00:11:34.189 --> 00:11:37.459
He says they want to examine her and look
further at what he has already done.

00:11:37.459 --> 00:11:40.259
She is perplexed as to how she suddenly has
all of this knowledge.

00:11:40.259 --> 00:11:43.699
While feeling hopeless, J3 tells him that
she never stood a chance.

00:11:43.699 --> 00:11:47.480
George apologizes, saying that he built J3
because it is his fault why Jules is dead

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:50.889
and that he built her so they could have a
life like they are supposed to have together.

00:11:50.889 --> 00:11:55.269
In this instance, J3 becomes aware that George
is dead and is fading within the archive.

00:11:55.269 --> 00:11:58.170
It is that aspect of George's consciousness
that refuses to vanish.

00:11:58.170 --> 00:12:02.029
J3 wishes for George's consciousness to depart
in the belief that he ends up happily with

00:12:02.029 --> 00:12:05.879
Jules that is why J3 finally gives George
the consent to put the archive into her, which

00:12:05.879 --> 00:12:08.860
he immediately does since there’s no more
time left.

00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:13.050
After a short coma, J3 regains consciousness
and acts as if she is now Jules.

00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:15.429
George is delighted for a moment until the
phone rings.

00:12:15.429 --> 00:12:19.090
The company's recovery team, which is on its
way to retrieve George and his robots, after

00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:22.549
he chose to run his secret sub-project, mysteriously
vanishes.

00:12:22.549 --> 00:12:25.800
Regardless of how hard his subconscious tries
to keep him from confronting the truth about

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:29.519
his death, George eventually walks toward
the ringing phone which J3 warns him not to

00:12:29.519 --> 00:12:31.290
pick up because the truth is bitter.

00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:34.209
Still, he picks up the phone and hears Jules’
voice.

00:12:34.209 --> 00:12:37.439
She bursts into tears and tells George that
the archive company people told her that his

00:12:37.439 --> 00:12:40.630
consciousness is about to vanish completely,
maybe this is the last time she could call

00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:41.630
him.

00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:45.679
George realizes he's been dead, and Jules
is making his final call before he fades.

00:12:45.679 --> 00:12:48.509
She summons the courage to convince their
daughter to speak with George and exchange

00:12:48.509 --> 00:12:50.199
their final farewells.

00:12:50.199 --> 00:12:54.199
George's eyes well up with tears as he confronts
the truth and he eventually vanishes.

00:12:54.199 --> 00:13:06.009
Jules eventually hangs up the phone and walks
away while carrying their young child.
