00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.320
Daniel Craig's run as James Bond&nbsp;
is finally coming to an end,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.480
so if you need a recap of everything he&nbsp;
got up to in his history as James Bond,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.480
don't worry this video has you covered.&nbsp;
This is everything that you need to know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.280
about the previous James Bond movies before&nbsp;
you see No Time to Die. Let's get started.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:31.360
Daniel Craig’s run as James Bond began in 2006’s&nbsp;
Casino Royale. Bond has just been promoted to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:36.720
a “double-o” agent, a top secret branch of&nbsp;
agents in MI6’s Secret Intelligence Service.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.600
On his first mission as 007, Bond thwarts a&nbsp;
terrorist attack on the Skyfleet airliner.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.400
The head of SIS, “M”, informs Bond that the&nbsp;
mastermind behind the attempted terrorist&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.600
attack was Le Chiffre, a private banker to&nbsp;
terrorists. He shorts successful companies'&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.280
stocks and stages terrorist attacks to tank the&nbsp;
stocks and reap the financial benefits. But after&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.160
Bond thwarts the Skyfleet attack, Le Chiffre&nbsp;
is left on the hook for a huge financial loss.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.960
And so, Le Chiffre stages a high stakes poker&nbsp;
tournament at the Casino Royale in Montenegro&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.200
with the hopes of recouping his losses. Bond&nbsp;
is sent to the tournament to beat Le Chiffre,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.520
with MI6 hoping that a defeat would force&nbsp;
a cash strapped Le Chiffre to aid them in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.200
taking down his terrorist creditors&nbsp;
in exchange for their protection.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.240
Bond’s allies on this mission include MI6&nbsp;
agent Rene Mathis and a foreign liaison&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.400
named Vesper Lynd. The tournament is&nbsp;
not an especially fun one for Bond,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.840
as throughout his stay in Montenegro,&nbsp;
he’s forced to murder a rival,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.880
is nearly killed himself by poison, and even LOSES&nbsp;
the tournament. Fortunately for that last one,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.200
Bond befriends a CIA operative named Felix&nbsp;
Leiter who buys Bond back into the tournament&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.440
with the promise that the CIA would be&nbsp;
the ones who get to arrest Le Chiffre.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.520
Eventually, Bond manages to successfully win&nbsp;
the tournament and along the way strikes up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.480
a romantic relationship with Vesper. Le Chiffre&nbsp;
has Vesper and Bond captured, and tortures Bond&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.720
to give up the password to the account holding&nbsp;
the tournament winnings. And that’s when the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:04.000
mysterious Mr. White shows up. White is a leader&nbsp;
of the secret organization “Quantum” who lost&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.760
a lot of money due to Le Chiffre. White kills Le&nbsp;
Chiffre and his men and sets Bond and Vesper free.

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:14.160
Vesper confesses her love for Bond and&nbsp;
he resigns from SIS to run off with her.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.240
On vacation in Italy, Vesper betrays&nbsp;
Bond and delivers the Casino Royale&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.640
winnings to Quantum. Bond fights off the&nbsp;
Quantum agents, but Vesper drowns herself.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.240
A distraught Bond calls M to return to&nbsp;
service and is told that Vesper had a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.880
boyfriend being held by Quantum and the&nbsp;
money was meant to secure his release.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.680
When Bond checks Vesper’s phone, he discovers&nbsp;
she’s left Mr. White’s phone number for him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:41.200
And so, Bond tracks down Quantum leader Mr. White,&nbsp;
shoots him in the leg, and takes him into custody.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.960
The story continues in Quantum of Solace, a…&nbsp;
sleepier affair. Mr. White’s Quantum agents&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:52.160
manage to rescue their leader from Bond and&nbsp;
SIS. Bond then discovers another Quantum leader&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.720
in Dominic Greene who is attempting to help&nbsp;
overthrow the Bolivian government and install&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:02.400
General Medrano as the new president. And so Bond&nbsp;
makes it his new mission to take down Greene.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.360
M thinks Bond is too close to this mission and&nbsp;
is fueled by revenge for Vesper, which is true,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.000
and calls Bond out of the field. But he continues&nbsp;
on his own, and thus doesn’t have the support of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.800
MI6. He teams up with Greene’s former flame&nbsp;
Camille Montes, whose family was killed by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:22.000
Medrano. Along the way, Bond also gets help from&nbsp;
old friends Rene Mathis, who is killed by corrupt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.760
cops working for Medrano, and Felix Leiter, who&nbsp;
tips Bond off to Greene’s location and the CIA’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:33.680
pursuit of Bond. Eventually, Bond and Camille&nbsp;
take down Greene and Medrano before parting ways.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.440
As Quantum of Solace comes to a&nbsp;
close, Bond tracks down Yusef Kabira,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.880
the boyfriend of Vesper Lynd. Turns out, Yusef was&nbsp;
also a member of Quantum, who seduced high-ranking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:48.000
women and staged his own kidnappings so they’d&nbsp;
pay his ransom. Bond decides to spare Yusef and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.560
has MI6 arrest him. With all of these loose&nbsp;
ends tied up, M has Bond reinstated into SIS.

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.600
And that brings us to Skyfall. James Bond is&nbsp;
sent on a mission with Eve Moneypenny to stop&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:04.000
a mercenary from stealing a hard drive&nbsp;
containing a list of names and details&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.720
of undercover agents currently in the field. If&nbsp;
the wrong people got their hands on that intel,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:14.080
it would be disastrous for MI6, which is why&nbsp;
M gives Moneypenny the go ahead to take a shot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:18.000
at the mercenary even though Bond&nbsp;
was also in the line of fire.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.920
Moneypenny accidentally shoots Bond&nbsp;
instead and the mercenary escapes.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:25.440
Following the debacle, M is pressured&nbsp;
by the chairman of the Intelligence and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.160
Security Committee of Parliament, Gareth&nbsp;
Mallory, to resign. Following this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.800
MI6’s servers are hacked and their headquarters&nbsp;
are blown up in a terrorist attack.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.000
James Bond, who was presumed dead&nbsp;
and was now living in retirement,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.280
spending his days drinking and having sex, returns&nbsp;
to London after seeing the attacks on the news.

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.800
Bond fails his physical, medical&nbsp;
and psychological exams, but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:52.320
M approves him to return to the field anyway.&nbsp;
Bond meets with MI6’s new quartermaster, Q,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.040
who equips him with a gun and a radio transmitter,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:59.760
and then heads off on his mission to track&nbsp;
down the mercenary and uncover their employer.

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:03.120
Eventually, Bond discovers that the&nbsp;
man behind the attacks was Silva,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.680
a former MI6 agent who now dealt in&nbsp;
cyberterrorism. Silva has become obsessed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.400
with his vendetta against M, who had sold him out&nbsp;
to the Chinese government while under her employ,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.997
in exchange for the release of several&nbsp;
other agents. Knowing that M had made a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.997 --> 00:05:15.120
similar decision in regards to Bond’s life,&nbsp;
Silva feels a certain kinship with 007.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:20.080
To put a stop to Silva’s terrorism, Bond has&nbsp;
Q and M’s chief of staff Bill Tanner leave an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:26.880
electronic trail for Silva to follow. The trail’s&nbsp;
destination? Skyfall, the Bond family home. Bond,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:32.880
M, and Skyfall’s gamekeeper Kincade prepare&nbsp;
the estate for Silva’s attack. In that attack,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.800
M is wounded, but Bond manages&nbsp;
to kill Silva once and for all.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:42.160
But then, M succumbs to her wounds and dies in&nbsp;
Bond’s arms. Following M’s funeral, Moneypenny&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:48.160
retires from fieldwork to become secretary&nbsp;
for Gareth Mallory, the newly appointed M.

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:53.360
And that brings us to Spectre. The&nbsp;
recently deceased M left Bond a message,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:57.360
sending him on an unauthorized mission&nbsp;
to kill terrorist Marco Sciarra.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.480
Bond takes Sciarra’s ring&nbsp;
for further investigation.

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:05.840
The new M is angry at Bond’s unauthorized mission&nbsp;
and suspends him from field duty. But, of course,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:11.120
Bond disobeys M’s orders and uses Sciarra’s&nbsp;
ring to infiltrate a secret meeting for whatever&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:16.240
shady organization Sciarra belonged to. At the&nbsp;
meeting, Bond learns of the organization’s leader,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:22.080
Franz Oberhauser, and of a hit to be taken out&nbsp;
against a former member known as the Pale King.

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.440
Bond has Moneypenny look into&nbsp;
Oberhauser and the Pale King.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:30.080
When Bond finds the Pale King, he discovers&nbsp;
that it is actually an ailing Mr. White,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:34.640
the former head of Quantum. Mr. White&nbsp;
then urges Bond to protect his daughter,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:40.720
who can help lead Bond to Oberhauser. White kills&nbsp;
himself and Bond hurries off to find his daughter.

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:45.040
White’s daughter is Dr. Madeleine Swann,&nbsp;
who tells Bond that the organization’s name&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:48.560
is Spectre, and it’s revealed that&nbsp;
previous Bond villains Le Chiffre,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:52.560
Dominic Greene, and Raoul Silva were all members.

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:57.200
As James Bond is out in the field learning&nbsp;
of Spectre, his boss M has his own problems&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:02.480
to deal with. The General Director of the new&nbsp;
Joint Intelligence Service, Max Denbigh, aka C,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:04.560
wants Britain to join the Nine Eyes global&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:08.320
surveillance initiative and shut&nbsp;
down the “00” program for good.

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:13.680
After defeating Spectre assassin Mr. Hinx, Bond&nbsp;
and Madeleine are brought to Oberhauser’s Spectre&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:18.960
base, where the villain tortures Bond and reveals&nbsp;
his evil plans. It is actually Spectre that is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:23.440
funding the Joint Intelligence Service and was&nbsp;
staging terrorist attacks to create a need for the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:28.320
Nine Eyes surveillance program, which would allow&nbsp;
Oberhauser to spy on the government and anyone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:33.760
looking to stop his evil plans. He also reveals&nbsp;
himself to be James Bond’s stepbrother who became&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:38.400
jealous of his father’s relationship with James.&nbsp;
Oberhauser killed his father, took on the name&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:43.840
Ernst Blofeld, founded Spectre, and set in motion&nbsp;
plans to ruin his brother James Bond’s life.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:49.920
It was Blofeld that was personally responsible&nbsp;
for the deaths of Vesper Lynd and M.

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:54.640
Bond and Madeleine manage to escape and blow&nbsp;
up the Spectre base. Upon returning to London,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.640 --> 00:08:01.440
they team up with M, Q, Moneypenny, and Tanner to&nbsp;
stop C from taking the Nine Eyes program online.

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:06.400
Blofeld has Madeleine kidnapped, and Bond must&nbsp;
save her from an imminently detonating building as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:11.120
M and Q shut down Nine Eyes and fight&nbsp;
C, who eventually falls to his death.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:15.040
Bond and Madeleine escape the building just&nbsp;
in the knick of time and Bond shoots down a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:18.640
fleeing Blofeld’s helicopter. Ultimately,&nbsp;
Bond decides to spare his brother,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:22.960
who is taken into custody by M. Bond&nbsp;
then decides to turn away from M and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:28.240
the “00” program to be with Madeleine and&nbsp;
pursue a quieter, simpler life in love.

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:32.880
And that's everything that's happened so&nbsp;
far in Daniel Craig's run as James Bond.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:36.960
What have been your favorite moment so far?&nbsp;
How do you hope his story ends? And who do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:41.120

Bond? Let me know in the comments below.&nbsp;&nbsp;
