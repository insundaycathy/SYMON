00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:02.120
Hi, Mystery Recapped here.

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:06.740
Today, I'm going to explain an American drama
thriller film called “The thinning.”

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:08.120
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:09.221
Watch out and take care!

00:00:13.215 --> 00:00:16.499
It is 2039, and the Earth has become overpopulated.

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:19.380
The human race is on the verge of dying.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.755
The United Nations declares that all nations
must annually cut their populations by 5%.

00:00:24.755 --> 00:00:28.636
Following those orders, the United States
implements a rule called "The Thinning."

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.950
In the thinning, the students must attend
a standardized test every year.

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.370
In the test, whoever fails is executed by
injecting them with a drug.

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.927
The movie starts as Laina Michaels is tutoring
a high school kid named Simon.

00:00:41.459 --> 00:00:46.179
Simon seems to have a hard time solving the
equations, so he asks Laina for something.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.480
She takes out a box of lenses, and hands it
to him.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.579
As soon as Simon wears them, he is able to
solve all the math problems.

00:00:53.122 --> 00:00:58.234
Elsewhere, we are introduced to Edward Blake
Redding, the son of Texas governor, Dean Redding.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:03.540
He sneaks out of his house at night and meets
his girlfriend, Ellie Harper, in his car.

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.300
Blake starts talking about the test they have
the next day.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.330
Ellie is very nervous about it... but Blake
assures her that she will pass.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.920
Just then, Blake’s father’s guard finds
them, and brings Blake back to Dean’s office.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.360
Dean is disappointed in Blake for sneaking
out the night before such an important test.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.420
He thinks that Ellie is a distraction for
Blake.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.250
The following day, it is the day of the test.

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.770
Many students lined up outside the school.

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.950
They have to go through an intense security
check before entering.

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.450
Blake asks Laina for one of her study lenses...but
she is out of them.

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.880
Laina and her friend, Kellan Woods, stand
in the line to get inside.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.520
One of the students had cheats written in
his arms.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.900
When he is caught, he tries to run away.

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.520
The guards capture him.

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.840
No one has ever been able to escape the exams
or cheat on it.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.240
Inside the school, Blake and Ellie hug for
the last time...before entering the exam hall,

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.410
and soon, the exam starts.

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:57.860
They have 2 hours to complete the test.

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.730
Everyone starts solving the problems on their
tablets.

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:04.410
Laina solves all of them without any problem
and is the first to complete it.

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.400
Her friend, Kellan, seems to be struggling.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.610
When the exam is over, they immediately get
the results.

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.510
The teacher in the class is calling several
names who fail the exam.

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.340
Students are anxious...hoping this will be
over soon.

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.520
Those who fail are taken by the guards.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.450
They cry, resist the guards, and some even
try to run away.

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.799
The guard would beat up those students who
resist.

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:29.129
Luckily, Laina, Kellan, and Blake pass.

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:33.959
However, at the last moment, Blake’s girlfriend,
Ellie, is called by the teacher, so the guards

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:34.959
take her away.

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:38.400
He quickly calls his father,
and asks him to help Ellie.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.299
However, his father doesn’t agree... saying
that the law is the same for everyone.

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:46.030
Frustrated, he runs to save her himself.

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.812
He attacks the guards and asks Ellie to run
away...but to no avail.

00:02:49.812 --> 00:02:51.629
No one would be able to escape.

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:55.640
Blake keeps trying to help Ellie, but there
is nothing else he could do.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.319
It is now a year later, and 24 hours
before the thinning test starts.

00:02:59.603 --> 00:03:02.694
It is Laina’s little sister Corrine’s
very first thinning test.

00:03:03.042 --> 00:03:04.412
The doorbell rings.

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.950
It is Laina’s teacher, Ms. Birch, who has
been taking care of Laina and Corrine like

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.540
her own children since their mother's death.

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.389
She tries to calm Laina down...because tomorrow
is Corrine's first test and Laina worries

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:19.139
about her sister; but she assures them that
everything will be fine.

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:22.219
Meanwhile, Blake records a video in his room.

00:03:22.219 --> 00:03:26.579
He intends to write all wrong answers in the
test to teach his father a lesson.

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:28.250
Cut to the day of the test...

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.540
Laina drops Corrine to her kindergarten.

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.433
In Corrine's class, they are presented with
a video animation...showing the current state

00:03:34.433 --> 00:03:39.450
of the Earth, so all nations must annually
cut their populations by 5%.

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.579
Some countries implemented rules like allowing
couples to have only one child.

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:45.590
While others executed the older generation.

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:51.130
In America, however, the government decided
to keep only the smartest ones and execute the others

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.050
These children are no exception.

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:56.209
The children’s test then starts.

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:59.590
Their teacher is saddened because some of
the children are going to be executed.

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.099
Thankfully, Corrine passes the test.

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:06.159
Laina and Kellan enter the school for their
test as well.

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:08.780
The test starts and finishes in no time.

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.639
Meanwhile, governor Dean finds Blakes’s
recording and is agitated.

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:17.451
He calls the test manager, Mason King, and
orders him to pass Blake regardless of his score

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.590
Mason switches his score with Laina, making
Laina fail.

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:26.270
The test results are in..but to everyone’s
surprise, Laina’s name is called too.

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:27.980
She has failed the test.

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:32.020
Ms Birch stops the guard as they take her....claiming
that she is her best student and there must

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:33.930
be something wrong with the system.

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.280
However, the results are final and cannot
be changed.

00:04:37.116 --> 00:04:40.246
She hands Laina a keycard so she can unlock the doors and escape.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.040
Blake is surprised to not have failed.

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:47.450
The students who pass, arrive at a school
party to celebrate their results.

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:51.660
Elsewhere, Dean is giving a speech as the
governor...to declare his presidency for the

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.770
president of the United States.

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:55.840
He boasts about their education system.

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:01.270
As a result of their system, they manage to
be the best in education among 196 countries;

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.070
the crime rate is decreasing by 26%.

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:08.080
Blake listens to his father’s speech while
at the party...then sneaks out of it.

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.930
He sneaks into the hallway and beats one of
the guards.

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:13.130
He then goes into the control room.

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:17.881
Meanwhile, Laina and the students who have
failed...are taken into a room and put against a wall

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:21.570
They are forced to remove all of their clothing
for decontamination.

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:25.760
Then, Laina and the others are taken to a
room where the guards are about to execute

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.410
them by lethal injection.

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:32.000
Suddenly, Blake cuts the electricity off...making
the whole school go dark.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.169
Taking this chance, the students who are about
to be executed, free themselves and try to

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:37.429
run away.

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.390
But none of them succeeds, except for Laina.

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:43.990
She uses the keycard her teacher had given
her, and gets out of the room.

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:47.810
Soon after, Mason comes to the room and asks
for a head count.

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:51.650
They find out that Laina is missing ,and start
looking for her.

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:54.900
Blake finds Lana and helps her fighting one
of the guards.

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:59.050
While talking, they realize that something
was done to Blake and Laina’s results.

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:03.041
They both enter into a vent and hide; they
follow the network cables to go to the server

00:06:03.041 --> 00:06:05.540
room where they can look at the results through
the computer.

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:10.450
Meanwhile, the school is still in complete
lockdown due to the power failure.

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:13.940
The news gets outside and is being broadcasted
all over the state.

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:16.301
The parents outside are getting concerned.

00:06:16.301 --> 00:06:18.935
Governor Dean calls Mason to ask him about
the situation.

00:06:19.826 --> 00:06:24.245
Meanwhile, the vents below Blake breaks, making
him fall into the swimming pool below.

00:06:24.713 --> 00:06:26.433
Laina jumps after him.

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:29.670
She brings him out of the water, but he is
not breathing.

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:33.150
Laina gives him CPR and somehow manages to
save him.

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:36.800
Blake and Laina change to some clothes they
find in the pool’s lockers.

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.710
They then continue to go through the vents
and reach the server room, but a guard stands

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:42.030
in front of the door.

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:45.720
Moreover, Laina’s keycard falls down the
vent in front of the guard.

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:49.460
He doesn’t notice the card but now she has
to get it back somehow.

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:53.330
Her plan is to go to the science lab and join
a string with a magnet to fish the key through

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:57.000
the vent, so they head down to the lab to
retrieve the equipment needed.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.620
However, in the lab, they make a slight noise
causing the guard to approach the lab.

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:05.650
They quickly try to escape; Laina manages
to get back to the vents but Blake is stuck

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:07.220
hiding in the lab.

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:09.530
Laina moves through it to fish the keys.

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:14.330
She successfully manages to get it up halfway,
when suddenly...a guard catches it.

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:17.360
But it turns out that it is Blake disguising
as the guard.

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:19.820
He had beaten the guard and put his clothes
on.

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:24.170
Shortly, the guard the two of them had attacked
earlier tells Mason about them.

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:26.400
He reveals that Laina had a keycard with her.

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:31.390
Mason gathers all the teachers together...suspecting
that someone has given it to their students.

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:35.300
When Ms Birch is in the room with other teachers,
she flirts with another teacher and manages

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:37.060
to take his key card.

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:40.990
Mason continues checking the teachers for
their keycards and ID cards.

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:43.750
Birch saves herself by showing them the card.

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:47.578
Since the other teacher doesn’t have his,
Mason threatens him to tell them where Laina is.

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:51.920
However, he insists he doesn’t know anything
as Mason beats him.

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:54.300
Laina finally gets to the Server room.

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:58.950
She opens the computer using the key card
but Mason has it protected with a password.

00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:02.780
She then texts Kellan who is good at hacking
to provide her with the access.

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:05.690
After some time, Kellan receives Laina’s
text.

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:08.340
He helps her to get through Mason’s computer.

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:12.935
Laina then searches for her results and finds
out she got 98% but still failed, while Blake

00:08:12.935 --> 00:08:15.175
got 15% and passed.

00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:19.941
She does more research and finds out...that
Ellie too had gotten 88% and failed, while

00:08:19.941 --> 00:08:22.320
others who had less marks than her passed.

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:25.980
Laina realizes that the grading system is
rigged, and the governor has been failing

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:28.090
whoever he wishes to.

00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:31.010
Laina sends a file with the rigged grades
to Kellan.

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:35.659
But soon, the power is back on, and Mason
sees that she is in the server room.

00:08:35.659 --> 00:08:37.849
Laina realizes this and runs out.

00:08:37.849 --> 00:08:40.599
However, Mason catches her almost immediately.

00:08:40.599 --> 00:08:44.240
Blake, on the other hand, is still in disguise.

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:46.370
He is with the students who have failed...

00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:50.259
He orders the guard to take them to the recreational
hall with the other students.

00:08:50.259 --> 00:08:53.060
But the guard refuses, so they get into a
fight.

00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:55.740
The guards restrain him and find out his identity.

00:08:55.740 --> 00:09:00.189
Just then, Kellan receives Laina’s message
and is surprised to see the rigged results.

00:09:00.189 --> 00:09:04.610
Kellan is friends with a news anchor, so he
quickly emails it to the news channel.

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:09.180
The reports broadcast the news showing the
receipts of the altercation in the results.

00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:12.600
After the photos are leaked, the governor
is called by his party head who threatens

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:15.170
to take his presidential candidacy back.

00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:19.660
Unwilling to let that happen, Dean Redding
throws all the accusations at Mason, and pretends

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:21.089
that he is innocent.

00:09:21.089 --> 00:09:25.860
He tries to prove this, so he has no choice
but to execute all of those who actually failed,

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:28.140
including his own son, Blake.

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:32.576
At the school, Mason and the guards take Laina
to the thinning room to execute her and the others

00:09:33.175 --> 00:09:34.466
Blake is there too.

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:38.670
Mason calls Dean to ask him if they should
proceed to execute the students.

00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:40.519
But Dean tells him to stop.

00:09:40.519 --> 00:09:45.420
He wants the students who have actually failed
to be executed, including his own son.

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:49.329
The guards free Laina and other students who
have actually passed the test.

00:09:49.329 --> 00:09:53.050
Laina kisses Blake, but the guards take him
and the rest who have failed.

00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:56.029
They execute them by injecting them with a
drug.

00:09:56.029 --> 00:10:01.240
As the lockdown ends, Laina is reunited with
her younger sister, Corrine, and Ms. Birch.

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:05.809
Cut to a few hours later, we see the bodies
of the executed students being taken underground

00:10:05.809 --> 00:10:07.149
in an elevator.

00:10:07.149 --> 00:10:11.501
The students start to move...revealing that
the drug they were injected to be a sleeping drug

00:10:12.269 --> 00:10:14.910
They stop when they reach a factory-like place.

00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:18.819
It is filled with goods being produced by
the tech company Assuru Global.

00:10:18.819 --> 00:10:20.779
Many people work in the factory.

00:10:20.779 --> 00:10:25.860
Just then, Blake is surprised to notice that
one of them is actually Ellie, his girlfriend.

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:29.999
This indicates that the students who are supposed
to be executed are actually brought underground

00:10:29.999 --> 00:10:32.460
to work as slaves for a multi-million company.

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:36.839
This was all planned by the government as
a strategy to get free labour.

00:10:36.839 --> 00:10:40.810
