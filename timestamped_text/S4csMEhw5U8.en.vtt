00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:02.650
Hi, Mystery Recapped here.

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:07.129
Today I’m going to explain an American science
fiction thriller film called “The Island.”

00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:08.580
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.142
Watch out and take care!

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.610
At the beginning of the movie, two people
are in the middle of the boat on the ocean.

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:21.220
As the male protagonist clasps his hand with
the female, he is drowned by three other creepy-looking

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.090
persons into the ocean.

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.693
Suddenly, Lincoln Six Echo snaps awake and
realizes that it was just a dream.

00:00:27.693 --> 00:00:32.399
A slick LED display above the bed greets Lincoln
with a good morning message.

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.730
Subsequently, another display on his wall
requests his presence at the tranquility center

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.890
for a wellness evaluation.

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.370
As Lincoln pees, the toilet recognizes that
his urine has excessive sodium and recommends

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.000
nutrition control.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.350
He has a bracelet wrapped in his wrist, which
automatically opens a drawer filled with his clothes

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.060
When Lincoln steps out of his room, we see
plenty of others in there who wear the same

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.210
clothes as him.

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.410
Lincoln and others wearing white stroll together
and enter the lift.

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.970
As the lift continues down, holograms play
along the walls showing snapshots of a beautiful

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.859
tranquil island among sparkling blue ocean.

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:11.479
The residents are told that the outside world
has become too contaminated to support life,

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:14.119
with the exception of a pathogen-free island.

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:17.890
Each week, one resident gets to leave the
compound and live on the island by way of

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:19.470
a lottery.

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.210
Just then, this week’s lottery winner is
announced.

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.439
The winner is Starkweather Two Delta.

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:28.590
An image of Starkweather Two Delta appears,
speaking joyfully about how it was always

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.789
his dream to go to the island.

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:35.389
As the lift reaches its destination, Lincoln
continues to walk along the compounds.

00:01:35.389 --> 00:01:40.509
In the background, various people engage in
various chores like yoga activities, fitness

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:45.209
exercise, and swimming; all seem content,
but black-tracksuited supervisors are shown

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:47.329
keeping close watch all throughout.

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:52.090
The citizens of the compound, all of whom
wear white tracksuits, are treated well, but

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.220
their lives are strictly regimented and regulated.

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:00.189
At the cafetaria, Lincoln swipes his bracelet
and asks for bacon; however, the nutritionist

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:03.299
advises him against it...for health purposes.

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.299
Seeing this, Lincoln’s best friend, Jordan
Two Delta tells him to "watch and learn”;

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:10.390
she pleases the nutritionist and cheats her
way with bacon.

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.299
They talk for a while, but the guards alert
them of engaging in far too much proximity.

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:18.829
She slides the bacon into Lincoln’s plate
as they separate.

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:23.159
Lincoln arrives at the office of Dr. Merrick,
the presiding doctor for the compound.

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:26.950
He inquires him about his friendship with
Jordan; and explains that there are proximity

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.740
rules against regular close-up contact.

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.049
He is further questioned about the nightmare.

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:34.159
He explains to the doctor his nightmare.

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:38.000
When he is probed, he confesses that he has
begun to question the regimentation of life

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.180
at the compound; why is Tuesday night 'tofu
night?'

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.690
He wants some bacon for his breakfast, and
he wants to wear different colors other than

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.360
white for his clothes; and there should be
more to life at the compound than just waiting

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.620
to go the Island.

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.079
Dr. Merrick calmly tries to explain that he
is lucky to have survived the contaminated

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:57.409
earth, and how the island is the only clean
place left.

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:02.030
He further explains that he himself, and all
other staff and supervisors at the compound,

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.190
are ineligible to win the Lottery, and cannot
ever go to The Island, as they are needed

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.909
to keep the compound facility operating smoothly.

00:03:09.163 --> 00:03:13.814
Then, Dr. Meerick wants to run some tests
on Lincoln and has him tied on a reclining seat.

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.030
He places some devices on Lincoln’s cheek
that crawl into his eye.

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.069
He assures Lincoln that these micro-sensors
will upload data for twenty-four hours, and

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:24.439
then pass out through his urine.

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:26.890
Lincoln then arrives at the work center for
work.

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:31.239
He and a citizen named Jones Three Echo are
using infuser tools to feed nutrients into

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:34.579
tubes that lead to where the citizens' meals
are prepared.

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:38.469
Lincoln is bored with the job, although Jones
finds it satisfying.

00:03:38.469 --> 00:03:44.000
The calm of the work center is suddenly broken
as a female citizen, Lima One Alpha, collapses.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.239
Lima One Alpha is heavily pregnant, and it
appears she's gone into labor.

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:52.030
The other women near her are ecstatic for
her, as she is now destined to go to the Island

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:53.780
with her baby.

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.459
Lincoln then illicitly visits a power-plant
basement where his friend, technician James

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:58.609
McCord works.

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:03.560
There, he discovers a live moth in the ventilation
shaft; he captures the bug and hides it inside

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.219
a matchbox.

00:04:05.219 --> 00:04:09.780
In the evening, Lincoln tells Jordan about
the flying bug he found...leading him to realize

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.719
that the outside world might not be contaminated.

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:15.150
He has a feeling that something is wrong.

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.250
Jordan however is baffled at how Lincoln Six
Echo is convinced of bad things being hidden..

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.680
behind the seemingly good life at the compound.

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.470
Soon after, the walls in the social center
light up with holographic displays as the

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.410
Lottery begins.

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.910
Citizens all around the compound stop and
begin watching nearby monitors and screens.

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:36.970
The Community Announcer begins the usual speech
about the Lottery and a lucky winner heading

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:38.490
to the Island.

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.210
The spin soon begins.

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:44.900
As it stops, Jordan’s name is shown in the
hologram; cheer and applause erupt.

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.370
She is frozen.

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.860
Lincoln seems unhappy at the thought of losing
his best friend, and at the chance of going

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.410
to the Island slipping away one more time.

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:55.850
To congratulate her, he touches her arm and
says goodbye.

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:00.370
The supervisor halts their brief union as
it breached the proximity rule.

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:02.930
That night, Lincoln sees the same nightmare
again.

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:06.760
He awakes suddenly, leaning up to look at
the flying insect and his face lights up with

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:07.980
an idea.

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:11.490
He sneaks along the compound into Sector Six
and releases the insect.

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:16.400
It flies, and he follows; he ends up in a
hallway in a medical sector.

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:21.130
He ducks through a door, finding a utility
closet with a number of blue medical lab coats;

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:22.700
one of which he puts on.

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:26.640
As he navigates his way through the medical
center, he looks through the window of a medical

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:30.070
room, and sees Lima One Alpha delivering the
baby.

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:34.640
Suddenly, the doctor injects something into
her body, and she starts trembling and then dies.

00:05:35.225 --> 00:05:38.986
Meanwhile, the nurse carries the baby into
another room and presents the newly-born girl

00:05:38.986 --> 00:05:40.075
to a couple.

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:43.760
The woman looks exactly like Lima One Alpha.

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.150
Lincoln is shocked and goes into the nurse
station.

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:50.540
He finds Starkweather Two Delta lying on an
operating table in the surgery room.

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:54.430
As they are about to make an incision through
his chest, Starkweather Two Delta wakes up

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:56.020
and starts to run.

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:59.770
He is chased by several guards and is finally
hounded by a gun.

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:01.600
Lincoln hides in a corner watching this.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:05.950
Dr. Merrick comes into the security room to
ask about the incident.

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:10.770
Upon close surveillance, the doctor realizes
that the disguised Lincoln had seen everything.

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:13.680
He rings the alarm bells and wants Lincoln
captured.

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:18.890
Meanwhile, Lincoln heads towards the compound
where girls reside to try and rescue Jordan.

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:22.230
Lincoln finds Jordan and tries to make her
understand that there is no Island and that

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:24.560
she will soon be killed for organs.

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:26.290
She is beyond surprised.

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:30.490
He convinces her, and they both run to escape
from the establishment.

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:34.300
Several guards chase them; but they escape
through a series of underground corridors,

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:36.620
and finally emerge into the outside world.

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:41.260
Outside, they continue to run while staring
in wonder at the world around them.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:45.630
Although the terrain is rocky, and looks barren,
they are very able to breathe the air.

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:48.240
There's no trace of any contamination.

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:52.490
As they see a living snake, they now believe
that the earth is not contaminated and the

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:54.440
Island is just a lie.

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:58.650
Back in the compound, the Community Announcer
delivers fabricated news that Lincoln has

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:02.620
been quarantined due to the exposure to the
contamination, while Jordan has been safely

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:04.540
transported to the Island.

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:09.640
Elsewhere, the truth about this compound is
revealed as Dr. Merrick makes a sales presentation

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:10.710
to potential clients.

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:15.857
It is revealed that this facility is in fact
a bio-engineering facility where Agnates are grown.

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:21.080
An Agnate is a clone of a regular person;
grown directly into adulthood, matching the

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:25.860
biological age of the client; its DNA completely
identical to the client's.

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:30.280
An Agnate is meant as a source of replacement
body parts for an ailing client.

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:34.250
Female Agnates can also serve as surrogate
wombs for a female client who cannot carry

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:35.520
a baby herself.

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:40.160
However, Dr Merrick falsely claims that the
Agnates are kept in a vegetative state, never

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:46.330
achieving consciousness; never think, or feel
anything; they are products; and not humans.

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:51.190
After the presentation, Dr. Merrick hires
Burkinabé mercenary, Albert Laurent, to find

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:53.330
and return Lincoln and Jordan to the compound.

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:58.190
Dr. Merrick explains that the world doesn't
know that the Agnate products are alive.

00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:03.209
If knowledge of this becomes public, the Institute
will be shut down for ethical violations.

00:08:03.209 --> 00:08:07.599
Dr Merrick explains that locating Jordan Two
Delta is particularly paramount.

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:12.450
Her sponsor, the person she’s cloned from,
is Sarah Jordan; she is comatose following

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:13.950
a car accident.

00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:17.730
Without multiple organ transplants, she'll
die within three days.

00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:22.950
This explains the "Lottery"; an Agnate "wins"
when their sponsor requires body part harvest.

00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:27.690
Elsewhere, Lincoln and Jordan reach a bar
where they manage to find McCord. and he takes

00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:29.390
the two of them to his home.

00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:33.800
There, he explains to them about their existence;
how they are human clones meant to serve as

00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:36.800
sources of body parts for the people they're
cloned from.

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:40.669
The memories they have of their respective
childhoods, families, and lives before the

00:08:40.669 --> 00:08:43.550
contamination are basic memory imprints.

00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:48.410
McCord also explains their names: Lincoln
and Jordan are the surnames of their sponsors.

00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:53.070
Echo means that Lincoln has been alive for
three years, while Delta means Jordan is four.

00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:57.650
The Two in Jordan's name is a regional code
for New York, where Sarah Jordan livz; Six

00:08:57.650 --> 00:09:03.000
is a regional code for Los Angeles, where
Lincoln's sponsor, Tom Lincoln livz.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.700
Lincoln and Jordan decide that they must locate
their sponsors and spread the truth of their

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:08.620
existence and the Institute.

00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:13.520
McCord assists them with maps, credit cards,
cash, and one crucial piece of advice; to

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:15.200
not trust any human.

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:19.890
Meanwhile, Laurent and his team locate Lincoln
and Jordan through the micro-sensors inside

00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:20.970
Lincoln’s body.

00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:22.670
The men arrive there and kill McCord.

00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:26.730
But the other two somehow manage to board
the train to Los Angeles.

00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:29.470
They expect to meet Lincoln’s sponsor there.

00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:33.420
After a lot of struggles, they finally arrives
at Tom Lincoln's estate.

00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:37.460
Lincoln peeks into a security camera near
the door; it reads his retinal prints, which

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:41.390
are a match for his sponsor's; the door unlocks
and opens for them.

00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:44.700
The two of them go inside and find photos
of Tom Lincoln.

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:48.990
At that moment, Tom Lincoln comes up from
behind, mistaking them for intruders, and

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:50.430
swings a golf club.

00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:54.680
Soon, he freezes in shock and amazement when
he sees Lincoln's face.

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:58.790
They converse for some time, and Tom reveals
that he is suffering from liver damage and

00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:01.140
that Lincoln is his insurance policy.

00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:05.410
The two agnates reveal to him the reality
of the institute and beg for his help.

00:10:05.410 --> 00:10:09.120
Tom assures them to take them to a television
news channel to flash the truth.

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:13.030
Tom asks the two of them to stay there while
he goes up to get a pair of shoes.

00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:17.470
In his room, Tom Lincoln secretly calls the
Merrick Institute, and asks them what his

00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:19.990
insurance policy is doing at his home.

00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:24.520
He comes downstairs, and as they are about
to move, Jordan sees Tom’s eyes and alerts

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:26.220
Lincoln that he is lying.

00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:30.000
Tom plans to trick Lincoln to go with him
to bring him to an ambush.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.010
They travel in Tom’s car when suddenly,
Laurent and his team approach them and start

00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:35.790
shooting at the vehicle.

00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:39.710
Lincoln drives as fast as he can, while engaging
in a fight with Tom.

00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:43.691
As the both of them flung out of the vehicle,
Laurent is holding his gun, aiming to shoot

00:10:43.691 --> 00:10:45.060
the clone.

00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:49.730
Lincoln copies Tom’s Scottish accent making
the two indistinguishable; Laurent is baffled.

00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:52.410
He doesn’t know who the real Lincoln is.

00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:56.260
Lincoln performs a sleight of hand and adjusts
his bracelet in Tom’s wrist.

00:10:56.260 --> 00:11:00.460
Laurent then realizes that the clone would
be wearing a bracelet, and upon seeing one,

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:01.890
he shoots at Tom.

00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:05.290
Tom is dead, and his body is sent to the institute.

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:09.440
Lincoln returns to Tom’s estate, and Jordan
and he make love to each other.

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:13.640
Back at the institute, Dr. Merrrick and the
incubation chief find out that the four newest

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:17.060
generations of agnates have shown interesting
neural patterns.

00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:19.850
They inherit memory imprints from their sponsors.

00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:24.040
Because of this, many agnates have shown the
ability to question, which can be harmful

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:25.060
to the establishment.

00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:30.280
Dr. Merrick believes the only solution is
a recall: the termination of half the agnates,

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:34.240
and the disposal of almost 200 million dollars
worth of products.

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:38.290
The mechanism for the recall is already in
place; a large numbers of Agnates will all

00:11:38.290 --> 00:11:42.910
be chosen simultaneously as "Lottery winners"
to "go to the Island” for termination.

00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:47.880
One such Lottery is shown, and Jones Three
Echo is one of the ones chosen.

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:51.690
Technicians and medical personnel are seen
going to the Incubation room, and prematurely

00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:55.260
extracting incubating Agnates from the incubation
pods.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:59.080
Meanwhile, Lincoln and Jordan plan to save
the living agnates.

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:03.210
Lincoln believes that the holographic control
room is the main base of the establishment.

00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:07.360
If he destroys it, all the agnates can see
the reality that the holograms have been hiding

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:08.390
from them.

00:12:08.390 --> 00:12:12.839
He dresses like Tom Lincoln and heads towards
Merrick Institute in a chopper.

00:12:12.839 --> 00:12:16.980
On the other hand, Jordan allows herself to
be caught by Laurent and taken to the institute

00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:18.320
as well.

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:22.280
In the car, Laurent looks thoughtfully at
the thermal implant under the skin of Jordan's

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:25.760
wrist, as she anxiously runs her fingers across
it.

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:30.200
As they arrive, Laurent meets Dr. Merrick
in his office, who expresses his gratitude

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:31.839
for Laurent's services.

00:12:31.839 --> 00:12:36.830
However, he learns that Sarah Jordan may not
survive even with the organ transplants.

00:12:36.830 --> 00:12:40.821
He now has moral qualms about the clones'
treatment after witnessing their fight for survival.

00:12:41.083 --> 00:12:45.510
Elsewhere, Lincoln injures the institute rep,
and heads towards the holographic room, while

00:12:45.510 --> 00:12:49.960
Jordan is in bed waiting for her organs to
be taken out for her sponsor, and suddenly,

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:52.160
she opens fire at one of the guards.

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:55.620
She goes out and meets Lincoln and gives him
a key she has stolen.

00:12:55.620 --> 00:13:00.440
Meanwhile, the doctors investigate Tom’s
dead body, and realize that it is the client’s

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:01.440
dead body.

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:04.702
They inform Dr. Merrick who hurriedly issues
a warning to find Lincoln.

00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:10.010
Some agnates are guaranteed a trip to the
Island but in reality are being taken to be terminated.

00:13:10.664 --> 00:13:14.579
Jordan sees that the agnates are being escorted
to a section of the building, and follows them.

00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:19.310
Lincoln finds the reactor and tries to shut
down the hologram power grid, but is shot

00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:20.870
by Dr. Merrick.

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:22.280
The two fight.

00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:26.650
Meanwhile, as the agnates are being loaded
into a lift, Jones is suspicious and tries

00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:27.950
to resist.

00:13:27.950 --> 00:13:31.170
But they are locked in what turns out to be
an incineration chamber.

00:13:31.170 --> 00:13:34.620
The security activates it, and just then,
Jordan arrives.

00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:38.350
Laurent soon follows and threatens the security
to deactivate it.

00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:40.820
The guard has no choice but to comply.

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:46.410
The agnates gasp for breath, while the reactor
fan overloads and is surging out of control.

00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:50.120
Lincoln is being strangled to death by Dr.
Merrick, but he manages to get hold of the

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:52.410
gun and shoots at the doctor’s neck.

00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:56.160
The reactor fan spirals out of control and
destroys everything it meets.

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:57.980
Dr. Merrick is dead.

00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:00.610
The holographic illusion is now shattered.

00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:04.620
All the agnates can see that there is no contamination
in the outside world.

00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:08.580
In surprise, all the agnates walk out of the
establishment and wander through the world

00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:10.630
they had never seen.

00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:13.680
Lincoln and Jordan kiss each other as Laurent
smiles at them.

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:18.110
The movie ends with Lincoln and Jordan sailing
away in a boat together toward an island,

00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:21.290
fulfilling their dream of one day going to
such a place.
