00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.500
Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.060
Today, I'm going to explain a Sci-Fi film
called "Westworld."

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:06.340
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:07.740
Watch out and take care.

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.170
A high-tech amusement park called Delos has
attracted the attention of many thrill-seekers

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.450
due to its promise to send their guests on
an adventure of a lifetime for an extravagant

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:16.600
price of $1,000 a day.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.539
Ed, a public relations officer working for
Delos, interviews several people who just

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:22.010
came from the resort.

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.470
One guest excitedly tells Ed that he shot
six people during his visit to Westworld,

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.970
but Ed clarifies that the people shot were
robots.

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.990
Ed explains that these androids were programmed
to look, act and talk like human beings.

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.510
Moreover, the robots also bleed just as humans
do to enhance the experience.

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.810
John, a returning guest at the amusement park,
has decided to take his friend, Peter, to

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:43.690
Westworld to help him unwind.

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.799
On their way to the resort, Peter asks John
about what he should expect.

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:50.639
John patiently answers his questions and informs
him that theyâ€™ll use real firearms.

00:00:50.639 --> 00:00:55.030
Soon, an announcer asks the guests to put
on their earphones to listen to the orientation.

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.910
John ignores the announcement, noting that
he's already heard the orientation before.

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.139
The orientation video points out that guests
are given a choice to visit three distinct

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:04.640
worlds that cater to their specific fantasies.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.369
In Westworld, guests can re-enact the gunfights
in the Wild West with the resort's android

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:09.369
inhabitants.

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:12.439
The guests are also given the opportunity
to rub shoulders with the kings and queens

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:15.119
of 13th century Europe during the medieval
era.

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.119
As the monitor displays images of the area,
the man sitting behind Peter smiles in anticipation

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:20.829
of living out his medieval fantasies.

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:25.229
In another option, guests can indulge in diverse
worldly pleasures available only in the ancient

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.049
Roman city of Pompeii at the height of its
Golden Age.

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.439
After hearing about the attractions available
in the Roman world, the man behind Peter starts

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.870
pondering whether or not it's a good idea
to send his wife there.

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.999
After getting off the hovercraft, Peter wonders
if the attendants guiding them to the cars

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:39.149
are androids.

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:42.479
John notes that the only way to distinguish
androids from humans is to look at their hands

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.049
because the robots have imperfect extremities.

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:49.100
After wearing the appropriate costumes, they
ride a stagecoach to the Westworld hotel.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.860
Upon arrival, Peter notices the lack of amenities
in the room assigned to them, but John points

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.890
out that it's supposed to be that way to give
them an authentic experience.

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.130
Peter mentions that his wife would have loved
visiting the shops in Westworld, but John

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.249
interrupts him, saying he should forget about
her because she only took him for a ride.

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:05.789
Soon, John and Peter leave their room to visit
the bar.

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:09.369
Peter orders a vodka martini, but John orders
whiskey for both of them instead.

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.650
He urges Peter to have fun, assuring him that
there's no way to get hurt at the resort.

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.319
When their drinks arrive, Peter chokes on
the liquor.

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:20.319
Not long after, a gunslinger arrives and starts
taunting Peter, saying he needs to come home

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:22.569
to his mother because he can't handle his
drink.

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:26.489
John sees the situation as an opportunity
to start a duel, so he urges Peter to confront

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:27.920
the gunslinger.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.640
Peter hesitates, but with some encouragement,
he faces the gunslinger.

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.500
As Peter reaches for his gun, the other patrons
scramble to find a hiding place.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.260
When the gunslinger urges him to make a move,
Peter draws his weapon and shoots before the

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
gunslinger could even point his firearm at
him.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.739
As the gunslinger staggers around, Peter shoots
him two more times.

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:48.180
After the other patrons drag the gunslinger's
body away, Peter asks John if he's sure that

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.879
the gunslinger was an android.

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:53.500
John assures him that there's no way he would
be able to kill a human at the resort.

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.040
In their hotel room, John urges Peter to try
shooting him with his weapon.

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.350
Peter pulls the trigger, but the gun doesn't
fire.

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.549
John points out that the weapon has a sensor
that prevents it from firing at anything with

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:04.240
a high temperature.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.700
After dinner, John and Peter visit the saloon
looking for sensual entertainment, so Miss

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:14.470
Carrie introduces them to Cindy and Arlette.

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.790
Peter asks John if the girls are androids,
but John doesn't give him a straightforward

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:18.790
answer.

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.440
On their way to their rooms, they suddenly
hear gunshots outside.

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.150
Carrie tells them that men are robbing the
bank across the street.

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.689
Peter suggests joining the robbers, thinking
that it might be fun, but John argues being

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:30.489
with the girls at the saloon would be much
better.

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:33.799
Upon entering the room, Peter and Arlette
slowly undress and get ready to be intimate

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:34.940
with each other.

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.140
Peter struggles to disclose that he's never
slept with a stranger before, but Arlette

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.189
ignores him and continues undressing.

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:43.719
As the gunfight continues outside the saloon,
Arlette approaches Peter in bed and starts

00:03:43.719 --> 00:03:44.719
making love to him.

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:47.890
When they finish, Arlette's eyes emit a silvery
glow.

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.989
After the female android leaves the room,
Peter tells John that he's having fun at the

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:52.250
resort.

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.410
While the guests are asleep, the resort's
employees arrive to pick up the android bodies

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:56.620
from the streets.

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.010
The men load the androids into a conveyor
belt that leads to the lab, where technicians

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:01.700
perform minor repairs.

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.409
The chief supervisor calmly guides the technicians,
but he's suddenly bothered when he hears about

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:07.840
a central malfunction on one of the androids.

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.739
During a meeting, he reports that breakdowns
have been occurring throughout the amusement

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:13.569
park for six weeks, and it has since doubled
in the past week.

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:17.560
In addition, central malfunctions in androids
continue to rise despite the corrections they've

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:18.560
already made.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.170
He points out that the pattern of the breakdowns
is similar to an infectious disease, spreading

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:24.000
from one area to the next.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.570
Other scientists are skeptical that androids
are contracting electronic diseases.

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.940
The chief inspector points out that the robots
are highly complicated machines, and they

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.130
still don't know exactly how they work.

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:36.570
Despite the problems they discovered, the
technicians prepare to reactivate the androids

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:38.780
in the morning before the guests wake up.

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:42.470
While Peter takes a bath, the gunslinger knocks
on the door and threatens John.

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:46.160
As Peter returns to the room, he hears John
pleading with the gunslinger, so he prepares

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.830
to confront the android.

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.730
Suddenly the housekeeper yells at him for
standing in the hall half-naked.

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:54.700
The housekeeper screams upon seeing his gun,
so Peter decides to barge in and shoot the

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:56.500
gunslinger to take him by surprise.

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.070
After being hit four times, the android falls
through the window and dies.

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:03.380
The sheriff arrests Peter and locks him up,
saying he'll have to stand trial for killing

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:04.390
the gunslinger.

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:07.860
John explains that the shooting was self-defense,
but the sheriff ignores him.

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.060
The sheriff warns John not to bother trying
to save Peter because the judge likes to hang

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:12.060
offenders.

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:15.350
Outside, John asks a woman to deliver some
food to Peter.

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:18.600
After the sheriff inspects the food, the woman
shows Peter that there's an explosive hidden

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.330
underneath the sheet covering his food.

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:24.010
Peter prepares two horses and positions them
outside the sheriff's office.

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:27.830
Not long after, an explosion occurs, and Peter
emerges from his cell.

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:31.720
The sheriff goes out to stop them from escaping,
but John shoots him twice, making sure that

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:32.720
he's dead.

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:36.240
John and Peter immediately flee from the town
and make their way to the desert to hide.

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.500
Later, John remarks that they can go back
to town and do anything they want because

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.690
there's no one to stop them anymore.

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:45.090
In the Medieval World, a guest playing as
a knight enters the Queen's room for a tryst,

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:48.370
but she tells him that the Black Knight is
looking forward to a swordfight with him.

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:51.460
The Queen tells him that the knight has the
strength of ten men, but his sight is weak

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:52.720
in the left eye.

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.700
She assures him that he will win the battle
if he stays to the knight's left.

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:59.040
The technicians take note so they could reprogram
the Black Knight with lateral weakness in

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:00.940
the left eye for the next day.

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:04.620
As Peter and John rest in the desert, a rattlesnake
slithers in their direction.

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:07.100
John tries shooting the snake, but he misses.

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.810
The snake lunges at him and bites him in the
arm, so he shakes it vigorously until it releases

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:11.860
its bite.

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:15.250
When the snake hits the ground, they both
shoot it until it stops moving.

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:18.990
John notes that the snake is not real, and
it wasn't supposed to attack him.

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:22.740
The chief supervisor hears about the snake
attack in the control room and tells the technicians

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:24.470
to take the android snake to the lab.

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:28.490
While inspecting the android snake, the technicians
discover that its logic circuits failed to

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:30.960
respond, but its mechanisms appear to be intact.

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:34.740
Due to the malfunction, the resort's administrators
decide to stop accepting new guests at the

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:37.760
resort, but they still refuse to shut the
park down.

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:41.360
Later that night, the technicians in the control
room start a bar fight in Westworld while

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:43.350
Peter and John are playing cards.

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:46.570
When one of the patrons drops at their table,
John decides to join in.

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:50.150
Before Peter could get up, a man grabs him
and flings him across the room.

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:53.120
They gleefully drink and participate in the
riot until they pass out.

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:56.720
Meanwhile, the lab technicians install an
upgrade on the gunslinger to improve his vision

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:58.040
and hearing.

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:01.620
In the Medieval World, the guest posing as
a knight tries to seduce a female servant,

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:03.980
but she rejects his advances and slaps him.

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:07.530
The chief inspector tells the technicians
to send the servant to the lab for central

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:10.180
repair, noting that she's not supposed to
refuse a guest.

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:13.080
However, the technicians couldn't find anything
wrong with the android.

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:16.700
Later on, the Black Knight confronts the guest
at the Medieval World as he was looking for

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:17.750
something to eat.

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:20.722
The guest tries to plead with the Black Knight,
but the knight is bent on engaging him in

00:07:20.722 --> 00:07:21.850
a sword fight.

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:25.650
The knight then starts striking him, but the
guest manages to block his attacks.

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:29.110
Due to the force of the knight's blows, the
guest loses his shield, leaving him with only

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:31.390
a sword as a means to defend himself.

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:34.580
When the knight cuts the guest's arm, the
chief supervisor tells the technicians to

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:36.030
shut down the androids immediately.

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:40.250
However, the knight continues his assault
and stabs the guest in the stomach with his

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:41.250
sword.

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:44.250
After waking up at the bar, John and Peter
head back to their room, but before they could

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:46.140
enter the hotel, the gunslinger confronts
them.

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:50.390
In the control room, the chief supervisor
orders the technicians to shut all the power

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:51.390
down.

00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:54.790
Meanwhile, John tells Peter that he will handle
the gunslinger this time.

00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:58.230
He urges the gunslinger to make the first
move, so the android draws his gun and shoots

00:07:58.230 --> 00:07:59.520
John in the chest.

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:02.460
John stumbles, confused by the sudden gunshot
wound.

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:05.090
He gets up and tells Peter that he's been
shot for real.

00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:07.720
The gunslinger fires another shot, killing
John.

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:11.820
The gunslinger asks Peter to draw his gun
as Peter tries to make sense of the situation.

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:15.130
Back in the control room, the technicians
tell the supervisor that they've lost control

00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:16.670
of the androids.

00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:20.040
Terrified by the idea that he could die at
the hands of the android, Peter decides to

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:21.910
run from the gunslinger instead of engaging
him.

00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:25.290
The gunslinger pursues Peter as he gallops
away on a horse.

00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:28.770
The chief supervisor notes that the androids
are running on stored charge.

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:32.120
Some robots will only last about an hour,
but some can still function for as long as

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:33.159
12 hours.

00:08:33.159 --> 00:08:36.430
Meanwhile, the androids at the Roman World
have begun their rampage, killing most of

00:08:36.430 --> 00:08:37.789
the guests in the area.

00:08:37.789 --> 00:08:41.389
The chief supervisor tells the technicians
to turn the main grid back on, but they fail

00:08:41.389 --> 00:08:42.889
to get their power back.

00:08:42.889 --> 00:08:46.100
They soon realize that they are locked inside
the control room because the doors are powered

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:47.319
by electricity.

00:08:47.319 --> 00:08:50.500
The chief supervisor tells the technicians
to get the doors open before they run out

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:51.910
of oxygen.

00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:54.459
Peter runs to the desert to get away from
the gunslinger.

00:08:54.459 --> 00:08:58.019
As he rides his horse along the hill, the
gunslinger sees him and shoots his hat.

00:08:58.019 --> 00:09:01.000
Peter leaves the horse and decides to lie
in wait for the gunslinger.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.329
However, the gunslinger spots him and fires
his gun at him repeatedly.

00:09:04.329 --> 00:09:08.310
Fortunately, Peter doesn't get hit, so he
runs back to his horse and flees.

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:12.330
Meanwhile, the oxygen level starts to drop
inside the control room with no way of opening

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:13.399
the doors.

00:09:13.399 --> 00:09:17.160
In the desert, Peter comes across a technician,
who appears to be on his way out of the resort,

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:18.759
but his car had broken down.

00:09:18.759 --> 00:09:22.550
The technician hides from him, fearing that
Peter is an android, but after realizing that

00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:26.740
Peter is a guest, the technician informs him
that the androids have started to malfunction.

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:30.160
Peter tells him that the gunslinger is after
him and asks for advice on dealing with the

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:31.160
robot.

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:34.290
The technician tells him that his only chance
is to use acid to impair the robot's vision

00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:36.310
and create noise to disrupt its hearing.

00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:40.190
However, the technician warns Peter that his
chances of defeating the robot are low because

00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:42.740
the android will always be one step ahead
of him.

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:46.470
Soon after Peter leaves, the gunslinger arrives
and kills the technician.

00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:50.129
Peter keeps going until he leaves Westworld
and crosses into the Roman world.

00:09:50.129 --> 00:09:53.760
When he comes across a manhole, Peter goes
down and finds himself in the resort's underground

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:54.760
complex.

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:58.019
Peter soon finds the locked control room,
but he discovers that the technicians have

00:09:58.019 --> 00:10:00.110
all died due to a lack of oxygen.

00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:03.999
In one of the monitors inside, he sees the
gunslinger arriving in the Roman World.

00:10:03.999 --> 00:10:07.510
Although Peter is nowhere to be seen, the
android still manages to track him down using

00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:09.230
his infrared vision.

00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:12.760
Peter soon comes across the lab where other
androids are kept for repairs.

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:16.319
He notices a beaker filled with Hydrochloric
acid and recalls the technician advising him

00:10:16.319 --> 00:10:18.020
to use it against the android.

00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:21.529
The gunslinger soon reaches the lab, but he
doesn't see Peter around.

00:10:21.529 --> 00:10:25.079
Peter lies down on a table, pretending to
be a robot, and waits for the android to pass

00:10:25.079 --> 00:10:26.160
him by.

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:30.449
When the gunslinger reaches his table, Peter
gets up and throws acid in the android's face.

00:10:30.449 --> 00:10:33.760
He watches the gunslinger react to the acid
burn for a while before finally deciding to

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:35.459
make a run for it.

00:10:35.459 --> 00:10:39.140
Despite the damage to his eyes, the gunslinger
continues to chase after Peter.

00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:42.860
He shoots Peter when he senses him close by,
but his gun runs out of batteries, so he throws

00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:43.899
it away.

00:10:43.899 --> 00:10:46.880
Peter continues fleeing and soon ends up in
the Medieval World.

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:50.230
When the gunslinger catches up to him, Peter
ends up beneath a flaming torch and learns

00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:52.680
that the android cannot detect him due to
the heat.

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:56.420
As he turns to run, he accidentally steps
on a piece of metal armor, alerting the gunslinger

00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:57.420
to his presence.

00:10:57.420 --> 00:11:01.589
In a panic, Peter immediately grabs a torch
and sets the android on fire.

00:11:01.589 --> 00:11:04.800
He watches the robot as it flails around the
room in flames.

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:08.390
While trying to find his way out of the castle,
he hears a woman yelling for help in the dungeon,

00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:10.199
so he releases her from her shackles.

00:11:10.199 --> 00:11:13.139
Peter tries to give her some water, but she
refuses.

00:11:13.139 --> 00:11:16.980
When Peter pours out some water into her mouth,
sparks suddenly bursts out of her head.

00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:20.870
Peter backs away in shock, realizing that
he encountered another android.

00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:24.740
As Peter prepares to leave, he runs into the
scorched gunslinger, still trying desperately

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:25.740
to attack him.

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:30.110
The android, however, has totally lost its
ability to see, so it falls down the stairs

00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:31.330
while trying to grab Peter.

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:34.980
The gunslinger tries to get up one more time,
but the robot finally breaks down due to the

00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:36.980
severe damage to its circuits.

00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:40.930
Exhausted from his ordeal, Peter sits down
on the steps, recalling the resort's advertisement

00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:43.370
offering him a vacation that he won't forget.

00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:46.470
The tragedy that happened in Delos highlights
the hidden dangers of bestowing sentience

00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:48.240
to inanimate objects.

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:51.589
Programming androids to act exactly like humans
for the purpose of entertainment seems like

00:11:51.589 --> 00:11:55.779
an innocuous endeavor, but problems become
apparent as system malfunctions start to occur.

00:11:55.779 --> 00:11:59.820
Even though the administrators of the park
had put some precautionary measures in place,

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:02.170
they didn't anticipate the androids misbehaving
on their own.

00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:06.070
The initial investigations conducted by the
technicians didn't find any problem with the

00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:09.970
circuits, which could mean that the androids
somehow learned to reject their programming.

00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:13.339
Due to the errors, the android seemed to act
even more like humans.

00:12:13.339 --> 00:12:16.730
The female servant in the Medieval World slapped
the guest trying to seduce her, as any other

00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:17.870
woman would.

00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:21.540
The Black Knight ferociously killed the very
same guest just to impress his Queen.

00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:25.070
In Westworld, the gunslinger relentlessly
pursued Peter in a seeming attempt to seek

00:12:25.070 --> 00:12:27.529
revenge after being killed twice before.

00:12:27.529 --> 00:12:30.560
Some would say that such a catastrophe is
bound to happen with humanity's continuous

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:41.449
pursuit to produce more realistic entertainment.
