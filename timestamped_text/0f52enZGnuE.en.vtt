00:00:00.919 --> 00:00:03.139
Welcome to Cinema Summary, ladies and gentlemen.

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:07.509
Today, I’ll be taking you through Polaroid
by Lars Klevberg, a movie about a young girl

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:12.700
who gets an old polaroid camera with a dark
secret and darker past.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.110
Now just so you know I’ll be first be going
through the movie’s plot before talking

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:21.780
about the movie’s monster, Harvey Weinstein,
the #MeToo movement, ghosts, and sort of how

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:26.280
you could beat the monster because 
 believe it or not all these things tie together.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:31.890
Just so you know: Spoilers ahead, and without
Further ado: This is Polaroid (2019)

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.420
Now as I said before its all about this young
girl named Bird Fincher, who for whatever

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.089
reason has 2 bird names who one day gets
this inscribed old polaroid camera from her

00:00:41.089 --> 00:00:46.760
friend, Tyler, along with a case and some film.
They work in this old antique shop in somewhere like

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.220
Nova Scotia or something, anyways

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:53.199
She tries it on Tyler who comes on to her
but she runs home to prepare for a costume

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:58.210
party because her friend, Kasey, that’s
her by the way, is all like “You know Connor?

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.079
Y'know, Connor's gonna be there, right?” and Bird’s all
like “....You know I’m usually awkward,

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:06.950
a loner, and not really social but I’ll
come just this once…” and so she does.

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.090
Going with her 2 other friends, Devin and
Mina, but as they get ready to leave, she

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.909
sees the photo of Tyler she took from earlier
suddenly gain this shadow in it.

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:21.390
So at this party, hosted by this nice...ish
girl named Avery, Bird runs into Connor, they

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.360
talk, particularly about a creeper shot Bird
took of Connor who shrugs it off as no big

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.200
deal. He's 'nice' like that

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.500
And then they get to talking about the camera
and Bird takes a photo of her friends and

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:36.140
Connor but as she takes it, she feels this
sense of foreboding, like something’s wrong

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.630
even though the photo is perfectly 
fine and this feeling only gets worse after

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.829
Avery grabs the camera and takes 
an unimpressed selfie with it.

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:49.900
And Avery's got this real attitude problem which only 
gets exacerbated by the fact the police are here

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.860
and they want to talk to Bird

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.619
Because as Bird finds out, Tyler has died
in the shop, all alone and there

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.630
are no suspects that the police can finger.

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.639
Which I think brings me to a good place to
talk about the actual beginning of the film.

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:07.259
Y’see the first characters we see and actually meet
are these two teenagers whose only purpose

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:12.180
in the flim is to introduce the camera, the
weird shadow in the photos, and the fact that

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.849
after taking a photo, you can get killed by
a something.

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:20.599
This girl’s camera had been sold off at
a yard sale where Tyler bought it, and brought

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:25.409
it to the antique shop where he and Bird hang
out before ultimately giving her the camera.

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:28.040
we actually see how Tyler died as he was at the antique

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.910
shop testing out this projector only to get
killed by a bed sheet -- well a something under

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.920
the bed sheet, a something that was trying to 
spook him in the photos that he was projecting

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.140
These details themselves are actually a big
hint towards what this movie’s monster is

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.900
and how it works though I’ll elaborate on
that later.

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.819
So back home, Bird looks at the photos she
took to find the dark shadow is in the background

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:54.799
of Avery’s selfie and she almost calls
Avery to tell her about it but doesn’t.

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:59.740
And unfortunately for Avery, she’s next
and we see how this monster terrorizes her

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:02.820
in her own house before it gets to her.

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:08.010
The next day, Bird hears that Avery died falling
down some stairs, in a freak accident but

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.010
Bird knows better.

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.739
When she checks the photos again, she finds
the shadow has moved to the group photo taken

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:18.319
at the party and she throws the camera against
the wall which doesn’t break it and instead

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.720
unleashes this shockwave that knocks her to
the ground.

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.220
And she tells her friends and Connor who kinda
just shows up at their lunch room table, about

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:30.569
her idea: showing them the photos, pointing
out the shadow and theorizes that the shadow

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:35.730
moving from photo to photo means that everyone
here at this lunchroom table is in danger.

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:42.280
All because of this camera, which Bird believes
will kill whoever is in a photo taken with it

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.027
And of course they don’t believe her, because

00:03:45.027 --> 00:03:46.380
1) That’s a crazy idea,

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.980
2) This is just how these kinds of movies go down,

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.680
and 3) Bird is a weirdo in general so whatever she

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:56.190
says just doesn’t vibe well with anyone
except for Connor whose just a sweetheart.

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.319
So Devin decides to burn the photos, thinking
that if they’re burnt then the shadow will

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:02.230
be gone, they won’t die, and everyone lives
happily ever after.

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.629
Which honestly is a great idea but as the
flames reach deeper into the photo, Mina’s

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:12.610
arm catches on fire as if by magic along with
Kasey who begins to smoke up like a bonfire and

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:16.660
to make matters worse: not even
a fire extinguisher can put out the flames.

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.820
But with some quick thinking, Bird slaps the
fire on the photo away which causes the magical

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.260
fire to stop and the photo heals itself.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:28.460
After dropping off Mina at the hospital to
get her burns checked up and leaving behind

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:29.850
Devin and Kasey.

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:34.690
Bird and Connor head to the antique shop where
the camera’s film and case were left with Bird

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:39.090
sneaking inside as Connor waits in the car
with the camera which begins to emit this

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:45.660
loud ringing noise and after shutting the
camera, he looks at the group photo and realizes

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:50.720
somethings wrong just in time as Bird manages
to get the case and the film from the shop

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.110
but runs into the shadow from the photo.

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:57.450
Who for some reason is attacking her and once
she and Connor get away, she freaks out trying

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:00.720
to understand why she’s being attacked if
she’s not in the photo.

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.580
She wasn't in the photo, right?

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.540
Well actually, she was!

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:10.110
Y'see her reflection was reflected
in a window in the group photo.

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:13.840
So now much like highschool
musical they are now all in this together

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.140
and, when Bird and Connor come back to the hospital

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:20.740
they find out that Mina was killed and
her death is supposedly a suicide

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:24.780
But the group knows better and don’t take
the news well, especially Devin who lashes

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:28.000
out against Bird who is
already blaming herself for everything.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.080
And like in a way, yeah everything is her
fault but she didn’t know something like

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:37.020
this would happen so she’s sort of innocent
which is basically what Connor tells her.

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:38.360
It’s not your fault,

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.230
you didn’t mean to do this.

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:45.410
Which gets Bird opening up about her dad who
was a reporter before he died in a car accident

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:50.040
that she had survived. So she
has survivor's guilt which sucks!

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:54.550
but thankfully they have their next clue:
An evidence locker tag dated back

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:57.280
to October 1974.

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:01.200
So the duo head to a library and
bring back some boxes from that date

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:05.040
where they find old newspaper articles dated back then

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:09.940
about 3 teens who were abducted and murdered by Roland Joseph Sable, a local photography

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:13.790
teacher and who has the initials
RJS just like the camera.

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:18.090
The same camera they now have which
Roland used to take photos of his victims

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:21.790
before he killed them in a
local school’s darkroom.

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:22.840
What a guy.

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:27.230
So the kids meet up and talk about the Thing
that attacked Bird who proposes that since

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:31.700
it was blurry and only encountered in the
darkness, it may be linked to the camera and

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:35.990
the photos in a more literal sense: that is
to say it might be weak to light and fire

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:38.440
much like polaroid photographs are.

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:42.620
This would explain why it hasn’t shown up
yet to kill them in this well lit restaurant

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:46.670
and Kasey proposes that ghosts showing up
in photos has been a thing for a long time

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:51.310
and that things become cursed after being
near bad things like murderers for example.

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:56.580
So maybe this Thing is the ghost of Roland
which actually has some historical or at least

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:59.080
alleged basis.

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:04.740
Now to go on a tangent, what I mean by that there are allegedly things that are haunted or cursed in reality

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:08.920
One that might come to your mind is the infamous Annabelle doll that you might know of from the movie

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:15.780
series which is based off an actual doll that’s
kept in a display case at the Occult Museum

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:21.620
Another cursed item that’s actually associated
with a murderer, is the Busby Stoop Chair.

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:27.430
It traces its history back to father-killer named
Thomas Busby who supposedly cursed the chair

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:29.950
to kill whomever would sit in it.

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:33.510
Since then, it’s had a history of killing
those who had sat in there as it was kept

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:38.710
in a pub though its since been hung at the
Thirsk museum since 1978.

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:40.240
As for why, well

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:45.130
Mostly to stop people from sitting on it although
supposedly it was inspected by a furniture

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:49.700
historian who said that the chair was made
138 years after Busby was hung.

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:53.360
So the story is pretty full of it, but its
fun to think about.

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:55.800
Though one final thing I want to talk about
is ghost photography.

00:07:55.800 --> 00:08:00.390
Historically, this has been a thing for a
while now wherein people spot wisps of an

00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:05.070
outline or a shadowy spectre in the background
of a photo and the one defining image of a

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:10.130
ghost being captured on film that comes to
my mind is that of the Brown Lady of of Raynham

00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:15.080
Hall that haunts the eponymous building in
Norfolk, England who is said to be the ghost

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:21.280
of Lady Dorothy Wadpole, the Sister of Robert
Wadpole, who died in the house due to smallpox.

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:27.730
Though usually in older photos they look a
bit different, looking more wispy than shadowy.

00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:32.909
But if Roland is haunting the camera, the
question is why?

00:08:32.909 --> 00:08:36.700
Devin throws a hissy fit and gets photographed
which causes him to be the next victim

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:41.840
and later he does get killed, and shortly after gets arrested by the local sheriff, who Connor and Bird

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:46.680
try to tell him about the whole Sable thing but the Sheriff
tells them to drop the case which doesn’t work

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:51.370
and the duo head to the house of Roland’s
widow, Leena Sable who tells them that the

00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:56.940
camera belonged to their daughter: Rebekah
Jane Sable, who was a victim of bullying and

00:08:56.940 --> 00:09:05.529
was traumatized and humiliated by 4 teenagers
at school who took photos of the deed which

00:09:05.529 --> 00:09:07.720
led to her taking her own life.

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:12.721
So Roland went on a killing spree and killed
3 out of 4 teens who tortured Rebekah but

00:09:12.721 --> 00:09:16.750
he was discovered by the police and killed
in the dark room of the local school, with

00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:18.649
the camera in hand.

00:09:18.649 --> 00:09:22.519
So it’s all coming together: Roland is haunting
the camera and trying to find the last surviving

00:09:22.519 --> 00:09:24.760
teenager who tortured his child.

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:27.520
So, Bird and Connor go to school

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:32.790
to find a match for the face in the photo that was given to them by Leena Sable and discover

00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:37.220
that Sheriff Pembroke was the teenager who
got away.

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:40.319
But they’re discovered by Sheriff Pembroke
with Kasey in cuffs.

00:09:40.319 --> 00:09:44.879
So to finally put Roland to rest and avenge
Rebekeh they take a photo of the last survivor

00:09:44.879 --> 00:09:50.139
who plot twist reveals that he and the teens
didn’t take those photos of Rebekah.

00:09:50.139 --> 00:09:54.940
Roland did, he had been abusing her for years,
and the 4 teens were trying to get her away

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:59.839
from him but Roland snapped and came after
them which lead to Rebekah taking her life

00:09:59.839 --> 00:10:04.379
as she couldn’t’ deal with the guilt of
what happened to her friends.

00:10:04.379 --> 00:10:10.300
So Leena was lying which isn’t surprising
since she let Rebekah get abused but this means

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:11.600
they got the wrong guy.

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:16.850
And that’s when the Thing arrives looking
more like a human skeleton who brutally rips

00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:22.339
Sheriff Pembroke in half before chasing the
teens though Bird manages to come up with

00:10:22.339 --> 00:10:24.300
a solution to deal with the Thing.

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:27.529
She runs downstairs into the school’s dark
room where she manages to get a photo of the

00:10:27.529 --> 00:10:32.019
thing and burns the photo, exorcising the
ghost at the cost of the two fingers that

00:10:32.019 --> 00:10:37.459
were in the photo and the film ends with Kasey,
Connor, and Bird surviving with our heroine

00:10:37.459 --> 00:10:40.470
tossing the camera into the drink.

00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:44.791
So before I begin to delve into explaining
what just happened and bouncing around some

00:10:44.791 --> 00:10:51.310
ideas I want to talk about the movie from
a more meta perspective very briefly. So hang on

00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:58.379
You see this movie was supposed to be released
in 2017 by Lars Klevberg, who based the movie

00:10:58.379 --> 00:11:03.510
off the short film of the same name
that was also directed by himself

00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:08.209
As for why it didn’t come, well it involves
the New York Times running their expose on

00:11:08.209 --> 00:11:12.149
Harvey Weinstein which made things difficult
for The Weinstein Company or TWC.

00:11:12.149 --> 00:11:16.499
You see, the Weinstein Company was releasing
the movie under their production company,

00:11:16.499 --> 00:11:20.820
Dimension Films, but they had to deal with
the whole MeToo movement which led to the

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:25.870
film being removed from release schedules
and ending up in limbo as Weinstein’s company

00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:28.840
went bankrupt in 2018.

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:33.259
So now, the film’s rights have been acquired
by Lantern Capital who entered an all-rights

00:11:33.259 --> 00:11:38.290
acquisition deal with Netflix which has finally
led to Polaroid seeing the light of day.

00:11:38.290 --> 00:11:42.920
With Polaroid theatrically releasing in Germany,
the UK, and the US in 2019.

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:48.360
Now moving on to your more regular explained section:
The Thing in the Photographs or the Specter

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:50.580
Or the ghost as you’ve probably figured out

00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:53.410
is heavily implied to be the ghost of Roland Sable.

00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:57.569
The murderous, psychotic, abusive, manipulative,
and all-around bad dad of the story.

00:11:57.569 --> 00:12:00.920
Who was haunting the polaroid camera due to
his spirit being linked to the gizmo as at

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:02.790
the time of his death,

00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:07.439
Thereby cursing it with his evil spirit which
we think is out of a desire for vengeance

00:12:07.439 --> 00:12:11.459
but by the end its confirmed that he’s just
a murderous jerk who much like Krombopulous

00:12:11.459 --> 00:12:15.389
Michael from Rick and Morty:
Just love killing, and photography.

00:12:15.389 --> 00:12:19.899
Unfortunately, he gets killed before finishing
his business so he sticks around to get that

00:12:19.899 --> 00:12:25.160
one last kid who got away and, y'know later, 
just killing people in general.

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:29.139
As for why he takes on that form, it’s
linked to the way he died: in the darkroom

00:12:29.139 --> 00:12:33.990
chemical tub which affected his spirit as
we see: he develops much like a polaroid photo

00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:38.279
and he is weak to the same things that polaroid
photos are weak to: fire and light.

00:12:38.279 --> 00:12:42.639
And of course, we learn that there’s this
sympathetic bond, this physical connection

00:12:42.639 --> 00:12:46.960
with the subjects of a photograph and the
photograph itself kinda like how voodoo dolls

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:51.399
can be used to hurt people as we see in the
lunchroom or the end.

00:12:51.399 --> 00:12:55.630
Now one last thing, I had some ideas someone
could use to try and deal with the monster.

00:12:55.630 --> 00:12:58.580
Not beat per say but use as a stop gap measure

00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:03.460
from dying or just protecting yourself long 
enough for a permanent solution

00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:05.900
So the first idea goes like and it's really simple:

00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:08.759
it's just to go one of those places where the sun never sets

00:13:08.759 --> 00:13:12.470
such as Norway, Canada, Sweden, or Alaska.

00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:15.399
The logic being that if the monster can’t show
itself in the light, then during those times

00:13:15.399 --> 00:13:19.080
of the year when the sun doesn’t set, you
effectively have a way to protect yourself

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:21.360
for 70 days give or take.

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:24.639
Though it might not be financially possible
for Bird’s family as they are noted as being

00:13:24.639 --> 00:13:26.050
financially unstable.

00:13:26.050 --> 00:13:30.329
Another idea that's kinda silly
but could work is to set up a bunch of night

00:13:30.329 --> 00:13:34.509
lights that all run on their own batteries
so that if the monster tries to knock out

00:13:34.509 --> 00:13:38.829
the power in the house, you still have those
other lights on, which should keep you guarded

00:13:38.829 --> 00:13:40.410
for a little while longer.

00:13:40.410 --> 00:13:45.019
This is especially true if you had a backup
generator of some sort or lit a bunch of candles.

00:13:45.019 --> 00:13:49.819
But that might, again, be a bit pricey to
employ or might not even work at all since

00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:53.380
Roland might be able to knock out power in
even a flashlight.

00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:57.040
I mean, if could knock out power in a 
house, surely he could do it to a flashlight

00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:01.100
Then there’s this final idea that is completely
completely unethical but a bit more practical

00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:05.199
for BIrd and that is to take photos
of just people. Anyone.

00:14:05.199 --> 00:14:09.189
We saw that the ghost would attack people
in a group photo but would single out a target

00:14:09.189 --> 00:14:14.970
in a more recent photo so you could theoretically
take a group photo and just keep on doing

00:14:14.970 --> 00:14:19.470
that as the monster hunts everyone down one
by one until you can make it to Norway or

00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:20.470
Alaska.

00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:24.869
Though the obvious problem would be that sooner
or later you would run of film which could

00:14:24.869 --> 00:14:29.540
easily be solved by having new film delivered
to your house, though in Bird’s case the

00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:32.840
only thing stopping her there would probably be money

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:38.500
although there are also other problems that 
do make this rather impractical.

00:14:38.519 --> 00:14:39.730
But what do you guys think?

00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:41.519
Got any ideas for beating the monster?

00:14:41.519 --> 00:14:43.079
Think my ideas are stupid?

00:14:43.079 --> 00:14:44.879
What did you think of the movie?

00:14:44.879 --> 00:14:49.379
Let me know with a comment down below, and
with that said thank you so much for watching
