00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:01.480
Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:05.910
Today, Iâ€™m going to explain a drama, horror,
thriller film called, "Cadaver."

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:07.180
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:08.400
Watch out and take care.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.240
A nuclear disaster left the world without
food and power, with the remaining survivors

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.240
losing hope.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:18.040
A young girl named Alice hears someone choking
from the neighbor's apartment.

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.289
She picks up a white rabbit doll on the floor
as the door creaks open.

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:29.070
Her parents, Jacob and Leonora, stop her from
entering.

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.439
Leonora opens the door to find their neighbor
hanging in the darkness.

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:35.090
That evening, Leonora wakes up, startled.

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.640
She goes to Alice's bedroom but finds the
bed empty.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.360
Her mind runs in terror, calling for Alice
desperately before she wakes up from the nightmare.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.920
Wanting to make sure, Leonora goes to Alice's
room.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.110
Alice draws her blanket down, shaking in fear.

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.600
A sound woke her up and asks her mother to
drive the monsters away.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.649
Leonora pretends to banish the monsters, assuring
Alice that they are not real.

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:56.739
Men start yelling and banging at their door.

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:00.020
Leonora sings a lullaby to calm Alice down
until the men leave.

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.890
Later that night, Jacob admits to losing hope,
but Leonora reminds him that they must endure

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:05.170
for Alice.

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.520
Before she sleeps, Leonora stares at her poster
of Macbeth, where she played the lead role.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.220
She hears the audience's cheers as she falls
asleep.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.960
The next day, Leonora scrapes the bottom of
a can for food, but it's not enough for her

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:16.960
family.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.220
Outside, a vehicle pulls up, and a man announces
a show where meals will be served.

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.520
Hearing this opportunity, Leonora hurries
outside.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.710
On the streets, Leonora asks the announcer,
Arnold, how they have food to spare.

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.330
He answers that the host is a kind man who
wants to entertain people in these harsh times.

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.570
Desperate, Leonora buys tickets for the show.

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.371
At home, Jacob thinks the show is too good
to be true, but Leonora believes that it's

00:01:39.371 --> 00:01:42.330
an opportunity for Alice to see a show and
get a proper meal.

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.250
With Jacob convinced, the family wears their
finest outfits and heads to the hotel.

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.000
There, Arnold stops them, insisting that the
show is not for kids.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.049
The owner, Mathias Vinterberg, interrupts
them and allows Alice to join the show.

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.729
Inside, the guests are in awe at the hotel's
pristine condition.

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:01.020
Lights filled the room, and servers wait on
them courteously.

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.140
Each one receives a meal, which they happily
eat.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:14.169
After the meal, Leonora and Jacob share stories
with another family: Lars, his wife Katherine,

00:02:14.169 --> 00:02:17.139
and their daughter Susanne.

00:02:17.139 --> 00:02:20.950
While they're talking, the room dims, directing
their attention to the stage.

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.650
On the stage, Mathias delivers a piece about
how humans' need to feel something separates

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:25.659
them from animals.

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:29.200
Leonora watches the presentation in awe, remembering
her times on stage.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.430
Mathias explains that the hotel will stage
multiple presentations while the guests are

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.060
given gold masks to separate them from the
actors.

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.760
The stage darkens, and a spotlight presents
a woman named Rakel approaching a table.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.040
She argues with a man named David, who scolds
her for being too busy for her daughter's

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.249
birthday while she mocks his alcoholism.

00:02:47.249 --> 00:02:50.301
The scene ends with the actors walking to
separate halls, opting for the guests to wear

00:02:50.301 --> 00:02:52.060
their masks and follow.

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.749
Along with other guests, Alice and her parents
climb up the stairs to follow Rakel, passing

00:02:55.749 --> 00:02:59.389
by the kitchen, where they're surprised to
see meats and vegetables around.

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:02.809
As they walk down the hall, they see other
performances in different rooms.

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:06.480
The family reaches the office where Rakel
and Mathias argue, ending with Mathias breaking

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.480
her heart.

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.409
Rakel walks out in tears, and the family follows.

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:14.120
Leonora assures Alice that it's all an act,
seeing the child worried about Rakel.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.760
David walks to Rakel, telling her that her
room is ready.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.489
Rakel leaves, leading the family forward.

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:22.010
At the end of the hallway, they've lost sight
of Rakel.

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.439
A door creaks loudly, starting Alice.

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:28.199
A woman in a red dress runs in panic, leading
Jacob and Leonora to question if it's part

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:29.199
of the play.

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:32.280
But when they see Alice scared, they assure
her that it is.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.010
Heading up, Jacob notices that the hotel is
empty.

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.349
Leonora assumes that the guests have followed
other actors like what they're doing.

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:41.909
When they hear Alice calling for Rakel, they
rush upstairs, warning her that it's the wrong

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:42.909
floor.

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:45.299
There, the hallway is much darker than the
others.

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:48.079
When they reach Alice, Jacob scolds her for
running off.

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:51.739
Leonora interrupts them, encouraging Alice
to find Rakel's room.

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:54.949
Alice walks ahead, counting up the room numbers
while her parents discuss.

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:58.980
Jacob disagrees in allowing Alice to continue,
but given their situation, Leonora wants to

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.260
let Alice be a kid for a change.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.040
When Alice stops counting, they realize that
she's gone.

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.760
They drop their masks, searching the rooms
for Alice.

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.069
They reach a locked room and hear Alice's
scream.

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:12.760
Jacob forces the door open, but the room inside
is empty and quiet.

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.030
Jacob curses; his suspicions about the hotel
are coming true.

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.039
A frantic voice comes from down the hall.

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:21.979
The couple braces themselves, only to see
Katherine searching for Lars and Susanne.

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:25.730
Leonora suggests checking Rakel's room as
Alice was looking for it before she disappeared.

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:29.250
They head to the fourth floor and reach Rakel's
room, but it's empty.

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:33.030
Jacob notices the bars on the window, worried
that it's meant to keep them imprisoned.

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.700
From the other side of the room, they hear
Katherine's scream and the sound of heavy

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:36.949
doors closing.

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:39.130
The two follow the sound, but Katherine is
gone.

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:42.530
Jacob checks the rest of the room, but Leonora
is drawn to a painting of a goat's head on

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:43.530
a plate.

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.020
She stares at the goat's eyes, seeing it blink.

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.640
She recoils in shock, but Jacob checks the
painting and sees nothing wrong.

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.849
On the carpet, Leonora finds one of Katherine's
earrings.

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:55.560
Coming down the stairs, Leonora finds a man
fleeing.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.069
She asks him if he's seen Alice, but he demands
they prove that they're guests.

00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:02.669
Since they lost their masks earlier, the man
doesn't trust them and leaves.

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:07.800
They reach another hallway and follow a thump
from a dressing room, where a man, Hans, talks

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:08.800
to himself.

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.020
They plead for his help, but he ignores them.

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:15.039
Instead, he rambles on about how turning into
something he refuses to be, his voice shaking

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:16.110
in grief.

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:19.169
He sweeps the contents of the table and reveals
a razor in hand.

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:22.740
Leonora and Jacob back away in fear as Hans
tells them to trust no one before taking the

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.180
razor to his own throat.

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:27.969
Jacob pulls Leonora out of the room, telling
her to forget what she saw and focus on finding

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:28.969
Alice.

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:32.750
Rakel finds them and mistakes them for new
actors, telling them to head to the ballroom.

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:36.900
She passes by the dressing room and tells
Hans to stop the act.

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.930
Hoping to find answers, Jacob and Leonora
follow Rakel.

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:43.960
On their way, they find Alice's doll on the
floor, seeing it stained with blood.

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:47.150
They enter the room nearby and find mounds
of clothes and other items.

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.919
Lars walks out from the darkness, searching
for his family.

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:53.319
Upon seeing a bag of fake blood on the floor,
Jacob asks for the doll and dips his finger

00:05:53.319 --> 00:05:54.610
on the bloodstain.

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:56.720
He tastes the liquid and notes that it's sweet.

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:00.569
With the blood being fake, they conclude that
everything they've seen is part of the show.

00:06:00.569 --> 00:06:03.919
The three head to the upper deck of the ballroom
to watch as numerous hooded figures bow before

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:04.990
Mathias.

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:08.099
He dictates their purpose, telling them to
trust him to survive.

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:11.430
Lars suggests following the workers wearing
aprons and masks, who are transferring items

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:12.990
out of the ballroom.

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:16.259
The three hide behind walls to watch the workers
dispose of the items.

00:06:16.259 --> 00:06:19.310
Leonora sees a worker open a painting like
a door and disappear.

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:22.469
Jacob and Lars inspect the painting but see
nothing behind it.

00:06:22.469 --> 00:06:25.849
They reach the kitchen, seeing the workers
load items into a dumbwaiter.

00:06:25.849 --> 00:06:28.650
They crawl across them to get to the other
side of the building.

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:31.919
In the basement, they see the dumbwaiter open
with clothes stuffed inside.

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:35.340
At the end of the path, they find an incinerator
filled with burning clothes.

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:38.980
Panicked and confused, Jacob walks away, believing
that the others are dead; that's why they're

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:40.919
burning the clothes from the other guests.

00:06:40.919 --> 00:06:44.939
Leonora refuses to believe this; otherwise,
she'd lose hope for their daughter.

00:06:44.939 --> 00:06:48.080
A waiter comes up from behind Jacob, holding
a knife to his neck.

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.610
It's Hans, revealing that his stunt earlier
was also fake.

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:54.009
Jacob asks Lars for help, but Lars escapes
to find his family.

00:06:54.009 --> 00:06:57.560
Out of options, Jacob twists Hans' arm to
allow Leonora to escape.

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:00.419
She runs back to the stairs but is blocked
by one of the workers.

00:07:00.419 --> 00:07:03.600
She climbs into the dumbwaiter, pushing the
button and closing it before Hans reaches

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:04.600
her.

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:07.710
Back in the kitchen, she runs and knocks one
of the meats from the hooks.

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:09.979
It clatters on the floor as if made of plastic.

00:07:09.979 --> 00:07:13.430
With the illusion broken, she sees that the
fresh vegetables and jars of food in the kitchen

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:16.210
are fake, made out of cardboard and plastic.

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:18.449
She escapes and heads to the office to hide.

00:07:18.449 --> 00:07:21.020
When Hans arrives, the room is empty.

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:24.189
Inside a cabinet, Leonora watches Hans through
the crack between the doors.

00:07:24.189 --> 00:07:27.830
There, she spots newspaper clippings about
a famous director who buys a hotel where his

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:29.029
daughter died.

00:07:29.029 --> 00:07:32.770
Hans reaches for the cabinet door but stops
when he's called back to the ballroom.

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:35.319
With Hans away, Leonora exits the cabinet.

00:07:35.319 --> 00:07:38.130
She sees the envelope that Rakel left during
the play.

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:41.069
Inside is a photo of Mathias and a little
girl who looks like Alice.

00:07:41.069 --> 00:07:45.360
Based on the newspaper clippings she saw earlier,
she wonders if it's Mathias' daughter.

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:48.870
Leonora heads back to the balcony above the
ballroom, seeing the tables set.

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:52.699
Mathias welcomes recruits to their show, telling
them to scatter the audience by creating scenes

00:07:52.699 --> 00:07:54.249
and characters to lure them.

00:07:54.249 --> 00:07:59.120
After delivering his instructions to the recruit,
he criticizes Rakel, reminding her that she'd

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:01.840
be out in the cold, desolated world without
him.

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:05.469
Rakel apologizes and promises to be whoever
he wants her to be.

00:08:05.469 --> 00:08:08.730
Another actress waltzes in, complaining that
someone moved the trigger, causing her to

00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:10.349
fall and lose an earring.

00:08:10.349 --> 00:08:13.520
Leonora pulls Katherine's earring out of her
pocket, realizing what could have happened

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:14.590
to her.

00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:17.309
Leonora hides in the darkness while following
the actors.

00:08:17.309 --> 00:08:19.370
She catches a glimpse of Alice crying.

00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:23.669
Overcome with tears, Leonora squeezes her
eyes shut, forcing the images away.

00:08:23.669 --> 00:08:26.729
The actress who lost an earring demands it
from one of the workers, but the actors aren't

00:08:26.729 --> 00:08:28.090
allowed in the basement.

00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:31.569
Leonora hears Arnold welcome new guests from
outside, terrified that the horrors will happen

00:08:31.569 --> 00:08:33.160
all over again.

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:36.320
She reaches Rakel's room, finding the trigger
in the goat painting.

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:40.789
She presses the button, and the floor beneath
her opens, dropping her into a dim crawlspace.

00:08:40.789 --> 00:08:43.490
Leonora hides as a worker climbs down from
above.

00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:47.110
She checks where the worker came from, seeing
a room full of discarded props.

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:50.730
On the floor, she finds a golden lock of hair,
similar to Alice's.

00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:53.160
Leonora follows the worker down a narrow pathway.

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:56.830
A trapdoor opens, letting her hear the actress
from earlier tell a recruit to push guests

00:08:56.830 --> 00:08:59.380
into the trapdoor if they don't fall instantly.

00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:02.850
When the trapdoor closes, she moves forward,
finding a peephole that looks into one of

00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:04.530
the hotel's hallways from a painting.

00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:08.190
Hearing ominous grinding and squealing, she
peeks inside and sees butchers carrying human

00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:10.320
corpses and processing body parts.

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:13.949
The horror has Leonora backing away until
she bumps into a figure in the dark.

00:09:13.949 --> 00:09:17.519
Lars slams her on the wall to knock her out
and drag her to another room.

00:09:17.519 --> 00:09:21.120
Leonora wakes up, hanging upside down in a
storage room full of corpses.

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:24.630
Mathias approaches her, commending her for
surviving the show the longest.

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:27.810
Knowing that she was an actress, Mathias offers
her to join his group.

00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:31.220
Leonora asks if the actors know that they're
eating the guests, but Mathias returns by

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:34.200
asking what she would do to keep her family
alive.

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:39.880
Seeing no hope in her, Mathias turns to Lars,
offering an upgraded room for his family.

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:44.080
Mathias hangs Alice's red dress on a meat
hook, apologizing for taking her away.

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:47.490
When Leonora calls him a criminal, he claims
that they're survivors, saying that Jacob

00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:48.790
understood.

00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:51.790
With Mathias gone, Lars cleans her neck in
preparation.

00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:55.830
Leonora cries and sees Jacob coming in, asking
Lars to leave him with his wife.

00:09:55.830 --> 00:09:58.639
Jacob kneels in front of her, convincing her
to join them.

00:09:58.639 --> 00:10:01.660
He reminds her that nothing is left for them
outside the hotel, and they can start all

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:02.800
over here.

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:05.710
But Leonora refuses to join the people who
hurt Alice.

00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:09.839
Jacob asks Lars for the scalpel, wanting to
prove his loyalty by doing the deed himself.

00:10:09.839 --> 00:10:12.660
Leonora begs for her life, but Jacob has decided.

00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:15.670
He kisses her on the forehead before swinging
back to knock out Lars.

00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:19.520
Jacob hurriedly frees Leonora just before
Lars stabs him in the chest.

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:22.790
Leonora runs, using the hanging corpses to
shield Lars from her.

00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:25.759
She grabs Alice's dress, but Lars pins her
to the wall.

00:10:25.759 --> 00:10:29.079
Seeing the meat hook behind him, Leonora gathers
her strength and pushes Lars, leaving him

00:10:29.079 --> 00:10:30.769
dangling on the hook.

00:10:30.769 --> 00:10:33.860
Leonora crawls back to her husband, cradling
him on her lap.

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:36.040
He mourns for Alice as he struggles to breathe.

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:39.089
Leonora cries, seeing the light in his eyes
go out.

00:10:39.089 --> 00:10:42.990
With her husband gone, she inspects Alice's
dress, wondering what happened to her.

00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:45.139
She finds blood on the dress then tastes it.

00:10:45.139 --> 00:10:47.860
Hope fills her eyes as she confirms that the
blood is sweet.

00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:49.360
Alice could still be alive.

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:52.540
She looks at the gold masks on the table and
forms an idea.

00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:56.079
With the play starting, Leonora heads back
up the hotel and joins the guest, wearing

00:10:56.079 --> 00:10:57.190
a mask.

00:10:57.190 --> 00:10:59.750
She sees the guests getting captured but ignores
them.

00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:04.490
When she's distracted, Hans grabs her and
throws her to the wall.

00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:06.440
He chokes her as a painting opens up.

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:09.490
Thinking quickly, Leonora puts her gold mask
on Hans.

00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:13.420
The butcher walks in, mistaking Hans as a
guest, and snaps his neck, carrying his body

00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:14.620
away.

00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:18.710
In the ballroom, Mathias puts on a show for
a small audience when Leonora confronts him.

00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:22.170
He tries to neutralize the situation, but
Leonora threatens to expose him if he doesn't

00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:23.420
return Alice.

00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:26.350
When Mathias doesn't comply, she reveals to
the guests that they will be butchered and

00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:27.790
served as food.

00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:32.199
Seeing the audience's confusion, Mathias laughs,
pretending that Leonora is part of the play.

00:11:32.199 --> 00:11:35.480
Mathias slams the table and tells her that
her family would still be alive if she accepted

00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:36.839
his offer.

00:11:36.839 --> 00:11:40.330
With nothing left to lose, Leonora realizes
what she needs to do.

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:43.269
She acts out the scene she plays for Alice
to rid of her monsters.

00:11:43.269 --> 00:11:45.820
The audience become captivated with her performance.

00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:49.480
Leonora deliberately leaves the ballroom,
realizing that the audience would follow suit,

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:51.260
curious on how her story continues.

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:54.430
Panicked, Mathias orders the actors to stop
her.

00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:58.880
Leonora marches down the hotel with the guests
in tow.

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:02.819
She leads them to the large painting, revealing
the secret passage to the crawlspace.

00:12:02.819 --> 00:12:06.199
She takes the guests and actors into the butchery,
revealing the truth.

00:12:06.199 --> 00:12:09.220
The guests scramble away in fear while the
actors are frozen in shock.

00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:12.649
Mathias tries to control the chaos as Leonora
meets him at the foyer.

00:12:12.649 --> 00:12:15.360
The actors thought that they were only stealing
from the guests and are horrified that they'd

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:19.079
eaten human flesh.

00:12:19.079 --> 00:12:25.269
Rakel walks in, stabbing Mathias in the chest
with hatred in her eyes.

00:12:25.269 --> 00:12:28.529
On the brink of death, Mathias finally confesses
that he took Alice because she looks like

00:12:28.529 --> 00:12:29.589
his daughter.

00:12:29.589 --> 00:12:32.149
But he still refuses to reveal her location.

00:12:32.149 --> 00:12:35.550
The actors take him away, leaving the grieving
Leonora alone.

00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:38.110
Her cries stop when she hears Alice's voice
again.

00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:41.720
She finds Alice on the grand staircase but
thinks her mind is playing tricks again.

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:44.829
Leonora begs for it to stop, looking away
from the confused girl.

00:12:44.829 --> 00:12:49.660
Finally, Leonora realizes that it's not her
imagination; she finally found her daughter.

00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:52.889
Leonora cries, hugging her child and admiring
her face.

00:12:52.889 --> 00:12:57.009
Alice asks where her father is, but Leonora
answers that it's just the two of them now.

00:12:57.009 --> 00:13:01.069
When morning comes, the hotel is abandoned,
leaving Mathias hanging among the corpses.

00:13:01.069 --> 00:13:03.840
Leonora and Alice go back to their desolated
home.

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:06.819
Seeing death everywhere, Leonora shields Alice
from the horrors.

00:13:06.819 --> 00:13:19.650
She looks back at the hotel, pristine and
brimming with hope in comparison.
