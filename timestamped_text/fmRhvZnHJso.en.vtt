Hey everyone.

00:00:03.093 --> 00:00:05.111
Welcome back to Movie Recap.

00:00:05.111 --> 00:00:07.185
Today I'm gonna show you a movie called,

00:00:07.185 --> 00:00:08.559
Dangerous Lies.

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:10.829
It is a 2020 American thriller film,

00:00:10.829 --> 00:00:14.167
directed by Michael Scott, starring Camila Mendes.

00:00:14.167 --> 00:00:17.478
The movie is about a woman is drawn into a web of lies and murder

00:00:17.478 --> 00:00:21.311
after a wealthy elderly man dies and leaves his estate to her.

00:00:24.166 --> 00:00:27.626
In Chicago, Katie Franklin is a waitress at a Chicago diner

00:00:27.626 --> 00:00:30.788
who wakes up a sleeping customer, her husband Adam Kettner,

00:00:30.788 --> 00:00:33.476
who has fallen asleep over his sociological theory

00:00:33.476 --> 00:00:35.471
and corporate analysis textbooks.

00:00:35.471 --> 00:00:38.002
They go make out in their car on Katie's break,

00:00:38.002 --> 00:00:40.248
wishing they could spend more time together

00:00:40.248 --> 00:00:44.351
but both so busy with their work and studies, trying to make ends meet.

00:00:44.351 --> 00:00:47.808
Adam says he can't wait to provide for her the way she deserves.

00:00:47.808 --> 00:00:51.971
When they return to the diner, they witness the diner being robbed at gunpoint.

00:00:51.971 --> 00:00:55.991
Adam grabs a frying pan and subdues the man, being called a hero.

00:00:55.991 --> 00:00:59.336
The robber, who killed a busboy, is sent to prison.

00:01:01.192 --> 00:01:05.002
Four months later, Katie is working as a caretaker for Leonard Wellsley,

00:01:05.002 --> 00:01:09.013
a wealthy and kind older man who lives alone in a very large house.

00:01:09.013 --> 00:01:11.708
Meanwhile, Adam has stopped taking classes

00:01:11.708 --> 00:01:14.939
in order to find a job but hasn't had luck yet.

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.992
Student loans and credit card bills are piling up.

00:01:17.992 --> 00:01:19.889
Katie is stressed and frustrated,

00:01:19.889 --> 00:01:21.857
and Adam assures her he'll take care of it,

00:01:21.857 --> 00:01:24.173
but it does nothing to make her feel better.

00:01:24.173 --> 00:01:27.091
Katie admits she hasn't been the same since the robbery.

00:01:27.091 --> 00:01:30.223
She told Adam not to go in there and he could have been killed,

00:01:30.223 --> 00:01:32.624
and she feels like he never listens to her.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.107
Katie goes to Leonard's house to think after her fight with Adam,

00:01:38.107 --> 00:01:41.973
and Leonard approaches with a baseball bat, suspecting an intruder.

00:01:41.973 --> 00:01:44.514
He says he keeps thinking he's hearing someone walking

00:01:44.514 --> 00:01:46.718
around in the house but never finds them,

00:01:46.718 --> 00:01:49.180
but Katie assures him no one is in the house.

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.112
She tells Leonard about her problems,

00:01:51.112 --> 00:01:53.894
and he offers to help her out with her situation.

00:01:53.894 --> 00:01:56.271
She tells Leonard, Adam needs a job,

00:01:56.271 --> 00:02:00.374
and Leonard hires Adam to do some work tending to the lawn and gardening.

00:02:00.374 --> 00:02:02.358
Katie is at Leonard's when Mickey Hayden,

00:02:02.358 --> 00:02:04.714
a real estate agent, comes to the door

00:02:04.714 --> 00:02:08.322
and tells Katie he represents a client who wants to buy the house.

00:02:08.322 --> 00:02:11.522
Katie tells him that Leonard has lived in the house his whole life

00:02:11.522 --> 00:02:15.440
and has no interest in moving, but promises to relay the message.

00:02:17.231 --> 00:02:21.040
Later, Mr. Calvern from the caretaker agency comes by the house

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.899
to do a drop-in on Katie and meet with Leonard.

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:26.623
He tells the agency Katie is doing a great job,

00:02:26.623 --> 00:02:29.384
and when Katie opens her next paycheck from Leonard,

00:02:29.384 --> 00:02:33.176
she finds that it is wildly over what she is supposed to be paid.

00:02:33.176 --> 00:02:37.348
She realizes Leonard must have done it after hearing about her money problems.

00:02:37.348 --> 00:02:39.054
She feels she can't accept it

00:02:39.054 --> 00:02:41.841
and wants to go back to Leonard's and return the check,

00:02:41.841 --> 00:02:44.322
but Adam convinces her, despite her reluctance,

00:02:44.322 --> 00:02:46.330
to cash the check, pay their bills,

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.565
and then write Leonard a check to make up the difference.

00:02:49.565 --> 00:02:53.455
As they return home, Hayden appears to be watching them from his car.

00:02:56.635 --> 00:02:59.936
The next day, Katie goes to Leonard's and finds him dead,

00:02:59.936 --> 00:03:03.071
sitting in a chair in the attic next to his record player.

00:03:03.071 --> 00:03:04.676
Adam comes over to comfort her,

00:03:04.676 --> 00:03:07.371
and he begins looking through the things in Leonard's attic,

00:03:07.371 --> 00:03:10.183
finding a padlock unlocked to a large chest.

00:03:10.183 --> 00:03:13.044
Inside there are old photos of Leonard and a woman

00:03:13.044 --> 00:03:15.454
and underneath a hidden wealth of pure cash.

00:03:19.711 --> 00:03:22.442
Since Leonard had no family, Adam tells Katie

00:03:22.442 --> 00:03:26.070
that Leonard wanted to help her and would have wanted her to have the money.

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.923
Katie and Adam decide to take the money for themselves,

00:03:28.923 --> 00:03:32.679
where it could make a difference, rather than letting it go into the system.

00:03:32.679 --> 00:03:36.700
Katie tells Adam they will have to be careful, and he assures her he will be.

00:03:39.114 --> 00:03:42.066
Detective Chesler arrives to investigate Leonard's death,

00:03:42.066 --> 00:03:44.132
but everything seems routine.

00:03:46.118 --> 00:03:49.401
Katie decides to go back to the agency to get another job,

00:03:49.401 --> 00:03:51.881
even though Adam thinks she shouldn't need to.

00:03:51.881 --> 00:03:55.583
When she tries to get another assignment, she s told by her Mr. Calvern

00:03:55.583 --> 00:03:57.908
that until the police finish their investigation,

00:03:57.908 --> 00:04:00.565
he can't put another client under her care.

00:04:00.565 --> 00:04:01.922
While Katie is interviewing,

00:04:01.922 --> 00:04:04.455
Adam goes to Leonard's house to collect the money

00:04:04.455 --> 00:04:06.352
but hears someone downstairs.

00:04:06.352 --> 00:04:08.860
He goes to check and sees a broken window,

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.240
and someone violently hits him from behind.

00:04:12.265 --> 00:04:14.212
When he awakes, he calls Katie,

00:04:14.212 --> 00:04:16.249
who admonishes him for not being careful

00:04:16.249 --> 00:04:18.919
and going to Leonard's home like he belongs there.

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:20.571
He tells her he counted the cash,

00:04:20.571 --> 00:04:23.096
and it's close to one hundred thousand dollars.

00:04:25.471 --> 00:04:28.734
Katie and Adam try to figure out who the person who broke in was

00:04:28.734 --> 00:04:30.306
and wonder what they knew.

00:04:33.148 --> 00:04:35.267
Fearful the person could return to Leonard's,

00:04:35.267 --> 00:04:39.005
they take the cash to the bank and put it into a safety deposit box,

00:04:39.005 --> 00:04:41.479
all while Hayden is still watching them.

00:04:43.607 --> 00:04:45.090
Chesler brings Katie in.

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.323
Katie had mentioned that Leonard wanted to be cremated,

00:04:48.323 --> 00:04:52.080
but Chesler tells her that since Leonard had no family and no will,

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.058
they don't know who will cover the costs.

00:04:54.058 --> 00:04:56.417
Katie says she will pay for everything.

00:04:56.417 --> 00:05:00.484
At Leonard s funeral, Katie and Adam are approached by Julia Byron-Kim,

00:05:00.484 --> 00:05:02.623
who tells them she was Leonard's attorney.

00:05:02.623 --> 00:05:06.157
She tells them that a few weeks ago Leonard called her out of the blue

00:05:06.157 --> 00:05:10.297
and hired her to handle his will and that Leonard left everything to Katie.

00:05:10.297 --> 00:05:13.101
They are shocked, and Julia offers to stay on

00:05:13.101 --> 00:05:16.862
and help Katie through the transition since Leonard had her retainer paid.

00:05:16.862 --> 00:05:21.068
Julia makes sure to tell Katie that she alone makes the decisions for the house,

00:05:21.068 --> 00:05:24.366
not Adam, and warns her that money changes people.

00:05:26.417 --> 00:05:29.307
Katie and Adam begin moving into Leonard's old house.

00:05:29.307 --> 00:05:33.530
Adam wants to immediately buy cars and go on fancy vacations,

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:35.939
but Katie tries to get him to calm down.

00:05:35.939 --> 00:05:37.995
Adam then gets a phone call from the police

00:05:37.995 --> 00:05:40.966
asking him to come down to the station to make another statement

00:05:40.966 --> 00:05:43.589
about the diner robbery, but when he gets there,

00:05:43.589 --> 00:05:45.645
no one has any record of calling him.

00:05:45.645 --> 00:05:50.370
He runs into Chesler, who had no idea he was involved with the diner incident.

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:52.698
She tells him the assailant from the diner robbery

00:05:52.698 --> 00:05:55.066
was killed in his cell a few weeks prior.

00:05:55.066 --> 00:05:56.951
Hayden comes to the house and again tries

00:05:56.951 --> 00:06:00.048
to get Katie to sell the house, and she refuses.

00:06:00.048 --> 00:06:02.011
When he gets aggressive and won't leave,

00:06:02.011 --> 00:06:04.275
she tells him she owns the house now.

00:06:04.275 --> 00:06:06.130
He accuses the will of being fake

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:09.508
and she tells him she will call the police if he doesn't leave.

00:06:11.844 --> 00:06:15.418
Katie tells Adam she wants to call Julia, but Adam dissuades her,

00:06:15.418 --> 00:06:19.224
and then, Katie finds a brand new, expensive watch in the bathroom.

00:06:19.224 --> 00:06:22.825
Adam tells her it's a knockoff, but she doesn't believe him.

00:06:24.863 --> 00:06:27.859
Meanwhile, Chesler finds the situation suspicious,

00:06:27.859 --> 00:06:29.679
going to check out the diner.

00:06:29.679 --> 00:06:32.466
She goes to talk to Adam but runs into Katie.

00:06:32.466 --> 00:06:35.074
When she finds out Leonard left Katie everything,

00:06:35.074 --> 00:06:37.306
she becomes even more suspicious.

00:06:37.306 --> 00:06:40.764
She asks Katie if Adam always came to pick her up at the diner,

00:06:40.764 --> 00:06:43.522
and Katie tells him he came early and was studying.

00:06:43.522 --> 00:06:47.072
She then tells Katie the truth that no one from the police called Adam,

00:06:47.072 --> 00:06:48.874
which Adam never told her.

00:06:51.353 --> 00:06:53.488
When Adam sees Katie talking with Julia,

00:06:53.488 --> 00:06:57.302
he becomes angry and says they agreed she wasn't going to talk to her.

00:06:57.302 --> 00:07:01.094
Katie tells Adam that he decided, but she said no such thing.

00:07:01.094 --> 00:07:04.336
Katie confronts Adam about not telling her about the phone call,

00:07:04.336 --> 00:07:07.332
and he tells her he's pretty sure he's being followed.

00:07:07.332 --> 00:07:09.508
Katie asks him if he went to the bank,

00:07:09.508 --> 00:07:12.645
and realizes Hayden probably called him down to the station

00:07:12.645 --> 00:07:16.601
so that she would be alone and he could come over and try to intimidate her.

00:07:16.601 --> 00:07:18.977
She theorizes he must know about the money.

00:07:18.977 --> 00:07:21.968
She tells Adam she warned him he needed to be careful.

00:07:24.149 --> 00:07:26.565
After talking with Julia, Katie tells Adam

00:07:26.565 --> 00:07:30.837
that if the police find out they did something illegal, they could lose everything.

00:07:30.837 --> 00:07:33.003
She says they need to put the money back,

00:07:33.003 --> 00:07:36.491
and Adam tells her he won't go back to the way things were before.

00:07:36.491 --> 00:07:39.263
Chesler interviews Mr. Calvern at the agency,

00:07:39.263 --> 00:07:42.899
who tells her Katie kept meticulous notes on Leonard's medications.

00:07:42.899 --> 00:07:46.010
He is shocked when Chesler shows him the much higher value

00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:48.901
check Katie deposited from Leonard the night before he died,

00:07:48.901 --> 00:07:52.042
and also had no idea Leonard also hired Adam.

00:07:54.158 --> 00:07:56.660
Katie goes into the gardening shed looking for Adam,

00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:58.858
but when he isn't there begins looking around.

00:07:58.858 --> 00:08:02.720
She moves a shelf away from the wall and finds another room inside.

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:05.825
Inside she finds uncashed checks written out to Ethan,

00:08:05.825 --> 00:08:08.471
and then a rotting corpse and a bag of diamonds.

00:08:10.729 --> 00:08:13.429
She tells Adam that Leonard had a gardener named Ethan

00:08:13.429 --> 00:08:15.699
who he said stopped showing up one day.

00:08:15.699 --> 00:08:18.648
Mr. Calvern shows up angrily shouting at Katie

00:08:18.648 --> 00:08:22.384
for taking advantage of an old man and tarnishing his company's name.

00:08:24.759 --> 00:08:27.013
Adam comes home with two brand new phones,

00:08:27.013 --> 00:08:29.603
and Katie tells him to return them and the diamonds.

00:08:29.603 --> 00:08:31.760
Adam says that Ethan stole the diamonds,

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:35.090
got shot, and died alone and no one knows.

00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:39.389
Katie wants to call Detective Chesler, but Adam says they could lose everything.

00:08:39.389 --> 00:08:42.730
Katie says as long as they have each other, they'll be alright,

00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:46.250
but Adam refuses, saying he will never go back to how it was,

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:48.678
and resolves to take care of everything.

00:08:48.678 --> 00:08:51.210
He gets rid of Ethans body and burns the checks,

00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:55.021
which they suspect Ethan never cashed to avoid creating a paper trail

00:08:55.021 --> 00:08:57.491
after hiding out after stealing the diamonds.

00:08:59.775 --> 00:09:02.241
That night, Adam hears an intruder in the house,

00:09:02.241 --> 00:09:05.459
grabs a gun, and jumps out to confront the intruder,

00:09:05.459 --> 00:09:07.626
who turns out to be Mr. Calvern.

00:09:07.626 --> 00:09:10.902
Shocked, he falls backward down the stairs and dies.

00:09:13.057 --> 00:09:14.414
Chesler comes to the scene

00:09:14.414 --> 00:09:16.819
and tells Katie she knows none of this is her

00:09:16.819 --> 00:09:19.169
and explains that everything is suspicious.

00:09:19.169 --> 00:09:23.157
Leonard dying and being cremated and then a will be found only after

00:09:23.157 --> 00:09:26.859
so she can't determine if Leonard died of natural causes.

00:09:26.859 --> 00:09:29.209
She asks if Adam mentioned a Ray Gaskin,

00:09:29.209 --> 00:09:32.415
the name of the diner robber who she tells Katie was a janitor

00:09:32.415 --> 00:09:34.501
where Adam was taking classes.

00:09:34.501 --> 00:09:37.315
She tells Katie not to let Adam take her down with him,

00:09:37.315 --> 00:09:39.191
and urges Katie to come to her.

00:09:41.293 --> 00:09:44.784
Katie meets with Julia and tells her about the whole situation;

00:09:44.784 --> 00:09:48.473
they go to the deposit box and find the cash is missing.

00:09:48.473 --> 00:09:52.102
Julia tells Katie that Adam is going to leave with the money and diamonds

00:09:52.102 --> 00:09:53.933
and throw her to the cops.

00:09:53.933 --> 00:09:56.192
Julia says she will try to hold off Chesler

00:09:56.192 --> 00:09:58.150
from getting her search warrant for the house,

00:09:58.150 --> 00:10:00.941
and that Katie needs to make sure Adam is still here

00:10:00.941 --> 00:10:02.908
so that everything doesn't fall on her.

00:10:03.648 --> 00:10:07.245
Meanwhile, the police find Ethan's body and alert Chesler.

00:10:07.245 --> 00:10:09.260
Katie goes home and confronts Adam,

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.595
who is packing up their things and the money.

00:10:11.595 --> 00:10:15.463
He tells her he looked up Hayden and that he s not a real estate agent,

00:10:15.463 --> 00:10:18.474
but an ex-con just released for robbing a jewelry store,

00:10:18.474 --> 00:10:20.087
three million in diamonds.

00:10:20.087 --> 00:10:23.512
His partner, Ethan, who he shot, was never caught.

00:10:23.512 --> 00:10:27.774
Katie wants to call the police, but Adam says they need to flee right away.

00:10:27.774 --> 00:10:31.681
Katie is relieved that Julia was wrong and Adam wasn't leaving her,

00:10:31.681 --> 00:10:36.070
and calls her to tell her that, but Hayden appears and holds Katie at gunpoint.

00:10:38.302 --> 00:10:41.154
Hayden holds Katie hostage as Adam aims a gun at him.

00:10:41.154 --> 00:10:45.027
Hayden shoots Adam multiple times and then knocks Katie to the ground,

00:10:45.027 --> 00:10:49.857
but before he can do more, Adam manages to fire a few shots at him, killing him.

00:10:52.648 --> 00:10:56.547
Katie holds Adam, crying as he says something about the garden and dies.

00:10:56.547 --> 00:10:59.676
Julia arrives and tells Katie they need to find the diamonds

00:10:59.676 --> 00:11:02.893
before the police get there or else she will be implicated.

00:11:02.893 --> 00:11:06.480
Katie realizes Hayden must have read her book on Leonard's medications

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:08.310
and killed him with an overdose.

00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:10.325
She wonders why Hayden shot Ethan,

00:11:10.325 --> 00:11:13.579
and Julia begins ranting about how stupid you would have to be

00:11:13.579 --> 00:11:15.806
to do that with three million in diamonds.

00:11:17.883 --> 00:11:21.493
When Katie realizes she never mentioned how much the diamonds were worth,

00:11:21.493 --> 00:11:23.199
Julia grabs Hayden's gun

00:11:23.199 --> 00:11:26.486
and tells her she was a public defender who got Hayden's case

00:11:26.486 --> 00:11:28.349
and pled him down to two years.

00:11:28.349 --> 00:11:31.267
Together, they worked to track down the diamonds to Leonard

00:11:31.267 --> 00:11:33.188
but weren't able to locate them.

00:11:33.188 --> 00:11:36.405
She tells Katie she had no idea Hayden would kill Leonard,

00:11:36.405 --> 00:11:39.848
having grown impatient, so when that happened she had to think fast.

00:11:39.848 --> 00:11:42.007
Katie realizes the will isn't real.

00:11:42.007 --> 00:11:44.945
Julia says Leonard would have given her the house anyway

00:11:44.945 --> 00:11:47.652
and begs Katie to tell her where the diamonds are.

00:11:47.652 --> 00:11:50.386
Katie says Adam hid then and she doesn't know,

00:11:50.386 --> 00:11:52.680
but wouldn't tell her even if she did.

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:55.721
Julia aims the gun at Katie, but Chesler enters.

00:11:55.721 --> 00:11:58.951
Julia tries to shoot Chesler but Katie shoves her,

00:11:58.951 --> 00:12:01.439
and Chesler shoots Julia, killing her.

00:12:01.439 --> 00:12:03.608
Chesler helps Katie out of the house.

00:12:05.905 --> 00:12:09.165
Four months later, Katie is working in her garden and pregnant

00:12:09.165 --> 00:12:12.365
when Chesler comes to visit her to let her know the case is closed

00:12:12.365 --> 00:12:15.159
and that Adam was cleared of being a suspect.

00:12:15.159 --> 00:12:18.897
Chelser says they searched high and low but never found the diamonds.

00:12:18.897 --> 00:12:21.815
Katie turns on the sprinklers and heads inside.

00:12:21.815 --> 00:12:25.697
The water from the garden begins washing, revealing the diamonds.

00:12:28.111 --> 00:12:29.137
Thanks for watching.

00:12:29.137 --> 00:12:31.265
