and it's best not to dwell on them too
 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.710 align:start position:0%
and it's best not to dwell on them too
much<00:01:08.880><c> as</c><00:01:09.280><c> we</c><00:01:09.520><c> simply</c><00:01:09.840><c> don't</c><00:01:10.000><c> have</c><00:01:10.159><c> the</c><00:01:10.320><c> time</c><00:01:10.560><c> to</c>

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:10.720 align:start position:0%
much as we simply don't have the time to
 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.310 align:start position:0%
much as we simply don't have the time to

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 align:start position:0%
