they try to get madison to remember her childhood&nbsp;
connection to gabriel they know now that dr weaver&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:33.120
and her team had madison or emily as a case study&nbsp;
madison remembers that gabriel would speak to her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:37.760
as a child and do bad things that she would get&nbsp;
blamed for like putting his finger through a cake&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:42.640
or even going as far as to get madison to hold&nbsp;
a knife and nearly killed her adoptive parents&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:47.600
madison starts freaking out saying that&nbsp;
gabriel was always making her take the blame&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:52.480
but she is snapped out of it moments later&nbsp;
the captured woman breaks free from her bonds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:58.000
but as she tries walking away she falls through&nbsp;
the floor and lands in madison's living room&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.240
the woman is taken to the hospital and&nbsp;
madison is taken into custody for kidnapping&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:07.440
shaw and moss interrogate madison where she&nbsp;
gets angered at the accusations to the point&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:13.600
where she yells and causes all the lights to break&nbsp;
shaw's phone then rings and gabriel's voice speaks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:18.880
to taunt them this shows madison innocence&nbsp;
sydney gets the simeon hospital's address&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:23.120
where madison was adopted and goes out to&nbsp;
find the place is now an abandoned building&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:28.960
she breaks in and manages to find tapes on emily&nbsp;
she brings them home so she and jean can watch&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:34.720
they learn that madison's biological mother serena&nbsp;
had given up her children to the hospital because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:39.760
she was 15 and they were the product of rape&nbsp;
which jean didn't know about since the hospital&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:45.520
told her that madison's mother died they see&nbsp;
dr weaver doing a test with madison as she says&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:50.960
that gabriel speaks to her and the camera pans&nbsp;
over to reveal the truth gabriel is a formerly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:57.360
conjoined parasitic twin akin to a teratoma tumor&nbsp;
in the back of madison's head dr weaver and her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:02.640
team surgically removed gabriel from her body but&nbsp;
fearing that they might accidentally kill madison&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:06.880
they took out only as much as they could while&nbsp;
the rest of gabriel remained dormant in her head&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:11.680
the visions that madison had seen were gabriel&nbsp;
projecting images into her mind that made her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:16.880
think she was living normally in her house when&nbsp;
in reality he was taking over her body and using&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:21.680
it to carry out the murders when derek smashes&nbsp;
madison's head against the wall that brought&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:26.720
gabriel back out and explains why madison always&nbsp;
wakes up with her head bleeding after seeing what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:32.320
gabriel did as this happens shaw learns from&nbsp;
sydney that the captive tour guide is serena&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:38.320
madison is in a prison cell with other women who&nbsp;
quickly antagonize her and two of them begin to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:43.280
assault her gabriel proceeds to take over&nbsp;
revealing his hideous face from the back of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:49.280
madison's head gabriel slaughters all the women in&nbsp;
the cell one by one and breaks free when a guard&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:54.640
comes by to stop him he recovers his signature&nbsp;
suit and weapon before he rampages through the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:59.840
station and murders other guards sean and moss&nbsp;
get to the scene to subdue gabriel but later get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:05.120
knocked out with a chair gabriel then proceeds to&nbsp;
the hospital where serena is admitted on the other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:11.120
hand sydney is in the hospital to meet serena once&nbsp;
she gets there gabriel kills one guard by frying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:16.720
his pacemaker and shoots him gabriel makes it&nbsp;
to serena's room while trying to kill sydney for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:22.320
madison choosing her over him as sibling serena&nbsp;
wakes and apologizes to gabriel for giving him up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:27.600
at the moment shaw appears behind and shoots&nbsp;
gabriel in return he hurls his weapon at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:34.080
shaw's chest and wounds him sydney tries to stop&nbsp;
gabriel from killing serena he throws a hospital&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:39.680
bed at her and appears to crush her as she tries&nbsp;
telling the subconscious madison that gabriel was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:45.440
responsible for her miscarriages as he was feeding&nbsp;
off the fetuses to regain power gabriel shoots&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:51.200
sydney in the head before going after serena she&nbsp;
begged for her life but still kills her saying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:56.080
that it's her fault that he's a monster suddenly&nbsp;
the whole scene turns dark then madison's voice&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:56.080 --> 00:10:01.280
calls out saying that gabriel was always a monster&nbsp;
it turns out that she has now learned his mind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:07.120
manipulation skills and forced gabriel to see what&nbsp;
she wants meaning he didn't kill sydney or serena&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:13.360
madison regains control of her mind and body and&nbsp;
creates a prison for gabriel to be trapped in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:19.120
never to allow him to hurt anybody ever again all&nbsp;
he can do is screen in futility from behind bars&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:23.360
madison helps take the bet off&nbsp;
sydney and she embraces her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:27.520
saying that she has always been her true&nbsp;
sister thanks for watching please don't&nbsp;&nbsp;
