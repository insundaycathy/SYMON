to the maternity ward dressed as a nurse.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.160
She passes a security guard, who asks for&nbsp;
identification. She ignores him, and takes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.600
the elevator. She then grabs a baby, and tries to&nbsp;
leave, only to be stopped by the security guard.&nbsp;&nbsp;

having a birthday party for her husband,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.400

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.266
married couple Treshawn and Gina Jackson.

00:00:48.662 --> 00:00:51.680
Meanwhile, three brothers, Ike, Addley, and Johnny&nbsp;Koffin

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.280
 are on the run from&nbsp;
the law after a bank robbery gone wrong.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.280
Johnny, the youngest, has been shot,&nbsp;
and has his brothers panicking.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.280
The brothers decide to head for home, so that&nbsp;
their mother can provide them with a getaway.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.440
Back at the house, Dave Lowe and his&nbsp;
fiancee, Annette Langston, George&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.120
Barnum and his girlfriend, Melissa&nbsp;
McGuire, and Daniel's co-worker,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.440
and friend, Julie Ross arrive&nbsp;
and are also celebrating Daniel's birthday.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.440
The news reports a tornado is heading their&nbsp;
way, and the basement is tornado proof.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.160
The three brothers reach their mother's home, and&nbsp;
find that their mother is nowhere to be found and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:33.520
that their stuff has been replaced. Addley begins&nbsp;
to freak out. Daniel, thinking it's his friend,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.560
Charlie, who has found a way in, goes upstairs to&nbsp;
greet him, only to be attacked by the brothers.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.400
They learn that Beth and Daniel now own the&nbsp;
house, after their mother lost the house on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.800
a foreclosure. As they are ready to flee&nbsp;
the home, Beth appears from the basement.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.440
Confused, and not knowing what she is seeing,&nbsp;
Beth flees but only reaches the front lawn,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.160
before Ike drags her back inside. Addley and&nbsp;
Ike begin to bicker, and Beth tells them that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:01.040
George is a doctor. Ike makes her bring George&nbsp;
upstairs, and threatens to kill Daniel if she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.920
tries to trick him. Without alerting her friends,&nbsp;
Beth asks George for help, who is quickly forced&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.320
to help Johnny. Ike gets a phone call from his&nbsp;
sister, Lydia who informs him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.560
that she and their mother are now living in&nbsp;
an RV and will be on their way to the house.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.120
Just as Ike hangs up, Julie emerges from the&nbsp;
basement and is chased back down by Addley,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.160
who forces them down on the ground. Julie tries to&nbsp;
run out the basement doors but Addley pulls her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.680
and she knocks herself out. Ike brings Beth and&nbsp;
Daniel downstairs and tells Addley to stay calm.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.840
As Ike begins to assist George, Addley&nbsp;
stays downstairs harassing the hostages,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.640
by pretending to rape Annette, and taking&nbsp;
Dave's wig. After a while, Lydia pulls over,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.680
and the brothers' "Mother" Natalie Koffin&nbsp;
appears and is angry&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.840
at Ike for losing their emergency phone.&nbsp;
She also tells him that she has someone who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.789
will cross them across the border to Canada,&nbsp;
but it will cost them ten thousand dollars.

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.880
Natalie is taken to the basement and meets the&nbsp;
hostages. Initially, she is nice to the hostages,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:02.240
thanking George for saving her son and even tells&nbsp;
Lydia to assist him. She also apologizes to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:06.960
hostages for her children's mistake, explaining it&nbsp;
is all a misunderstanding and she will be leaving&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:11.040
in the morning after Johnny gets better. She&nbsp;
learns that her sons have been sending her money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.320
every month, since she lost the house. She tries&nbsp;
to ask Beth and Daniel politely for the money,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.240
but after they tell her that they have no idea&nbsp;
of what she is talking about, she thinks that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.960
they are hiding it, and tries to get them to cave,&nbsp;
by forcing Addley and Ike to break Daniel's hand.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:38.480
ATM, Beth tries to get Vicky's attention and warns&nbsp;
her to leave, but before the two girls can, Ike&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:44.080
realizes what is going on, and holds them hostage.&nbsp;
Ike then teaches Beth a lesson by giving the girls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.880
one knife, and telling them that whoever kills the&nbsp;
other, will get to live. Vicky picks the knife up,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:54.480
but quickly drops it after Jenna pleads. Ike then&nbsp;
decides to kill them both, so Jenna kills Vicky.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.127
Jenna hears an ambulance, and runs towards&nbsp;
it, but is shot down by Ike in the process.

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.920
Back at house, Annette tries to get the others&nbsp;
to listen, as Natalie is only helping her sons,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.720
only to be ignored by Treshawn. In the dump,&nbsp;
two sanitation workers pull over, and find a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.520
whimpering Melissa behind the dumpster, and call&nbsp;
the police. Lydia is in the restroom, trying to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:20.560
wash off some blood from her shirt, when George&nbsp;
walks in. He finds her pills on the floor, and she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.440
informs him that she must take them because of her&nbsp;
sensitive skin. George tells her that the pills&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.320
are sugar, and learns she never saw a doctor, and&nbsp;
was also home schooled. He then tells her that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:35.040
her mother lied to have Lydia cover herself up,&nbsp;
so that boys don't notice her. He gives her his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:40.320
shirt, and she takes it, just as Natalie walks in&nbsp;
on them. She warns George to stay away from her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.800
As they hear the news, police officer Skay 
pulls over and Natalie forces Daniel to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.920
send the officer away, threatening to hurt Beth.&nbsp;
Daniel co-operates with the officer, and sends&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:55.600
him away. After being sent downstairs, Natalie&nbsp;
realizes Daniel is a good liar, and tells Lydia to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:00.560
look for the money downstairs. There, Lydia finds&nbsp;
a Valentine's Day card to Julie, from Daniel.

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:07.280
Meanwhile, Ike tells Beth that they don't&nbsp;
have enough money, so Beth tells him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:12.240
how Treshawn owns a dry cleaner's. Ike gives&nbsp;
Beth the phone, and calls Treshawn to ask him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:17.280
for the safe's pass code. Treshawn does so, and&nbsp;
also tells Beth he has a gun in the cabinet.

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:23.360
As Johnny begins to bleed, he breaks down&nbsp;
to his Mother, and tells her he doesn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.840
want to die a virgin, breaking his Mother's&nbsp;
heart. George, who asked to get cleaned up,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:32.960
finds Lydia, and asks who Queenie is, a name he&nbsp;
heard earlier. A scared Lydia tells him the story&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:37.840
of Queenie, a monster who her mother says lives&nbsp;
in the woods, and punishes bad kids. Although&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:42.080
she doesn't believe the story, she is still&nbsp;
traumatized by the sounds she hears outside.

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:49.120
Down in the basement, the hostages are trying&nbsp;
to keep calm, when Addley comes down the stairs,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.520
and tells them that one of the women is getting&nbsp;
lucky by popping his younger brother's Joystick.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.680
As he asks who they choose to send upstairs,&nbsp;
everyone turns their back on Julie,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.560
so Addley drags her upstairs. An angry Treshawn&nbsp;
grabs a pool stick and runs after them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:07.760
but Mother quickly brings Julie back downstairs,&nbsp;
stating she is not worthy of her son, and quickly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:12.960
lays her eyes on Gina, after Treshawn tries to&nbsp;
be the "strong man". She finds Gina perfect,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:18.000
and tells Addley to take Gina upstairs, who breaks&nbsp;
down, and tells them that Dave works at a bank,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.880
and he and Annette are not friends of hers, nor&nbsp;
Treshawn's. Mother Natalie, not knowing who to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:28.320
pick, forces Treshawn and Dave to fight, and the&nbsp;
loser's woman will be forced upstairs. As the two&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:33.920
men decline, she threatens to take both women.&nbsp;
As Addley plays the song "Whack-A-Doo", Dave and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:39.120
Treshawn fight, as their women cheer for them not&nbsp;
to give up. Treshawn ends up winning, and Annette&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:44.320
is dragged upstairs by Addley. Back upstairs,&nbsp;
Johnny has stopped breathing, and George is trying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:48.960
to convince Lydia to change her mind, as she is&nbsp;
not like her family, but Lydia shows she loves&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:54.000
her family, and will not turn against them. As&nbsp;
Johnny is revived, Addley walks in with Annette,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.360
and calls his mother. Lydia notices what is going&nbsp;
on, and warns her Mother that what she plans to do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:03.440
is not right, but Mother tells Lydia that they&nbsp;
are lying to them, and are hiding the money.

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:10.240
At the dry cleaner's, Beth mixes the combination&nbsp;
numbers to buy some time at getting Treshawn's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:15.040
gun. After Ike opens the safe, and gets the&nbsp;
money, Beth gets the gun, and points it at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:19.760
Ike. As he gives her the cellphone, Ike reaches&nbsp;
for the gun, and Beth hits him in the head with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:25.280
an iron. She runs and hides in the clothes, after&nbsp;
finding the doors locked. Ike begins taunting her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:29.840
while she is on hold with the police. As&nbsp;
she reaches the police, Ike catches her.

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:35.680
Back at the house, Mother is makes Annette&nbsp;
change into something more "decent".&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:40.080
While looking through a box which contains&nbsp;
pictures of a boy, and various newspaper articles,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:44.320
it is concluded Daniel and Beth have been&nbsp;
having problems after their son was run over.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:49.040
Annette pleads that she believed Mother that no&nbsp;
one would be hurt, but Mother ignores her pleads,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:53.840
and takes her to Johnny. As George tries to&nbsp;
protect Annette, Lydia is forced to take him away,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:17.560
He tricks Ike by confusing Beth and Daniel's&nbsp;
last name, "Sohapi" and "so happy". Ike falls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:28.560
watches in horror, not being able to do anything,&nbsp;
as Lydia points a gun at her the whole time.

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:36.720
Back at the storm, Skay gets up, being slightly&nbsp;
injured, and goes to Beth's aide. Beth is injured,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:42.000
and lets Skay know that Ike is not moving. As&nbsp;
Skay approaches to help Beth, Ike opens his eyes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:50.520
angering Mother, who continues to burn all of&nbsp;
his stuff. Mother then turns to Julie, and makes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:55.240
Addley drop liquor on her head, before burning&nbsp;
her head. Mother then quickly goes to Julie,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:55.240 --> 00:09:00.360
and puts the fire out, stating that "Marriage is&nbsp;
sacred". As she goes upstairs, Mother begins to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:04.680
question whether she was doing wrong, torturing&nbsp;
an innocent, so she begins to look around for the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:10.040
money. Gina, now tied up with plastic wrap on&nbsp;
the floor, finds a way to get up. She turns on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:15.240
the chimney, and puts her bound hands through it,&nbsp;
burning the plastic wrap off. She unties herself,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:20.360
and quickly goes to Treshawn. At the hospital,&nbsp;
Melissa is able to wake up during operation,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:29.920
She orders Addley to bring Daniel upstairs. Addley&nbsp;
goes to the basement and finds Treshawn missing,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:34.880
but before he can react, Daniel attacks him,&nbsp;
and Gina puts plastic wrap over his face.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:39.840
Daniel and Annette then take turns stabbing him,&nbsp;
as he apologizes for what he has done. Julie is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:45.840
also about to stab him, but drops him, showing&nbsp;
remorse. Treshawn, now half deaf and blind, grabs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:51.280
Addley's gun, and goes upstairs to try and kill&nbsp;
Mother. Gina goes after him, trying to stop him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:56.400
but Treshawn does not hear her. She surprises&nbsp;
Treshawn, who reacts quickly, and shoots her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:01.360
in the side. As he realizes what he did, Mother&nbsp;
shoots him dead. Mother goes to the basement,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:06.880
and finds Addley dead. She calls Ike, and makes&nbsp;
Daniel say goodbye to Beth. As he lets Beth know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:12.400
he is sorry, Mother shoots Daniel dead, as Beth&nbsp;
listens, and breaks down. Mother then tells Ike&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:17.229
that Addley is dead, and to bring Beth home.&nbsp;
Ike then begins to grieve his brother's death.

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:23.360
Back at the house, Lydia ties Julie&nbsp;
and Annette with plastic wrap again.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:27.360
George begins to tell Mother that none of her&nbsp;
kids look like one another, and look nothing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:32.720
like her. Mother, enraged, threatens to kill him,&nbsp;
but Lydia convinces her that they need George.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:36.720
Ike and Beth then burst through the front&nbsp;
door, and Mother lets Ike know Beth and Daniel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:41.200
had the money all along, and makes George&nbsp;
and Lydia help Ike take Johnny to the RV.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:45.440
Mother reveals to Julie and Annette that Beth&nbsp;
was the one who hid the money and is the one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:49.520
responsible for all their friend's deaths.&nbsp;
Beth then reveals that she was hiding the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:53.920
money for the baby that she will have. She&nbsp;
also reveals she knew Daniel was cheating,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:58.320
and wanted to leave him. Mother, now&nbsp;
enraged, makes her take a pregnancy test.

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:05.360
In the RV, Ike tells George he must now&nbsp;
shoot George, as they don't need him anymore,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:10.640
but Lydia pleads that he can come with him.&nbsp;
Ike agrees, and turns to Johnny. As George is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:14.880
going to thank Lydia, Johnny shoots him dead,&nbsp;
stating that he knows George will somehow find&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:20.720
a way to tell the police. Lydia exits the RV,&nbsp;
and breaks down. Beth takes the pregnancy test,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:25.520
and it comes out positive. Mother tells Beth&nbsp;
that she is lucky to have life in her belly.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:29.680
As she turns, Beth grabs the toilet lid,&nbsp;
and knocks out Mother, before going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:33.840
Annette and Julie. She unties Annette,&nbsp;
and tells her about a rifle in the garage,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:39.840
while Beth unties Julie. Ike exits the RV, and&nbsp;
goes looking for Lydia. After Beth unties Julie,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:44.640
who reveals to Beth she was Daniel's mistress,&nbsp;
Annette gets the rifle, but finds it to be empty.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:49.200
Beth runs to the garage, while Julie says they&nbsp;
should run for it. She goes to the front door,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:54.560
finds Lydia, and closes the door, before running&nbsp;
after Beth. Julie runs into Ike, who is aiming a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:59.600
shotgun at her. She closes the door and tries to&nbsp;
run away, but half her face is blown off as Ike&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:04.560
shoots her. In the garage, Beth and Annette try&nbsp;
looking for bullets, but are forced to hide when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:09.520
they hear Ike coming. Ike begins to look for them,&nbsp;
but they attack him. He is able to grab Beth,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:14.000
but Annette shoots him in the face with a nail&nbsp;
gun. They make a run for it, but Ike attacks them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:19.120
again. They begin to choke him, before filling his&nbsp;
face with Drano, and then dropping a television on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:24.429
his face. The two hear Mother coming. Annette&nbsp;
goes looking for help, while Beth faces Mother.

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:32.080
Mother, now filled with raged that her oldest&nbsp;
son is dead, goes after Beth. The two fight,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:36.960
and Mother is able to knock Beth down. Mother&nbsp;
begins filling the house with gasoline, and lights&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:42.160
it on fire, just as Beth wakes up. She grabs a&nbsp;
cutting board, and knocks out Mother with it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:46.800
She goes outside, just as the firefighters&nbsp;
reach the house. She hugs Annette, just as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:51.920
the firefighters find a survivor. They find&nbsp;
Gina, who is severely injured. Beth tells the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:57.491
firefighters that Mother is still inside, but the&nbsp;
firefighters find no one, as the house burns down.

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:03.600
Months later, Beth's water has broke, and&nbsp;
she is taken to the hospital by Annette,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:09.440
Gina, and Melissa. That night, Beth wakes up to&nbsp;
the emergency alarms going off. She gets up, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:14.735
goes to check on her son, who is now missing. Beth&nbsp;
screams in horror that her infant son is gone.

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:21.600
In the final scene, Mother Natalie is revealed&nbsp;
to be alive and well and was in fact the woman&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:25.520
at the beginning who broke into the maternity&nbsp;
ward, and Johnny was the unseen doctor who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:30.080
killed the security guard. Lydia is driving&nbsp;
the RV, while Mother Natalie sings Beth's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:34.000
baby a lullaby and telling Lydia and Johnny&nbsp;
that they have a new member to the family...&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.560
implying that she has gotten her final twisted&nbsp;
and cruel back-at-you revenge against Beth by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:43.491
abducting her baby and will raise it as her own...&nbsp;
in a life of crime, murder and other debauchery.

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:50.000
