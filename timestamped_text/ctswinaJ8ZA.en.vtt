00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:02.090
Welcome back to Movie Recaps.

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:07.579
Today I will show you a drama film from 2019
based on true events, entitled Dark Waters.

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:08.680
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:10.420
Watch out and take care.

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.200
A car can be seen driving in the middle of
the night.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.160
It stops next to a tall fence and a few teenagers
come out, immediately jumping over the fence.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.040
They find a lake, where two of them skinny
dip.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.630
Suddenly they are told to get out of the water
by two men in a boat, that are spraying the

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.060
water with some kind of substance.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.330
More then 20 years later and a few states
over, a group of partners in a law firm gather

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.780
in a conference room to welcome a new partner,
Rob Billot.

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.530
Meanwhile, two farmers walk into the offices
of the firm and demand to speak to him.

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.550
His secretary goes to fetch him out of the
meeting and takes him where the men are waiting.

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.120
They explain that they are acquaintances of
his grandmother, who told them that Rob is

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.220
an environmental lawyer and they really need
his help.

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.090
One of the men tells him to watch the tapes
they've brought.

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.180
But Rob refuses them, explaining that he defends
big corporations.

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.690
The men leave and he returns to the meeting.

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.269
His boss, Tom Terp, asks about the trouble,
but Rob brushes it off.

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.330
That night, Rob is back home with his wife
and child, having dinner.

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:09.909
He seems troubled.

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:14.440
The next day he drives to West Virginia to
see his grandmother and investigate the case.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.020
They talk about the farmers that came to see
him in his office and she tells him that she

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.580
used to take him and his sister over to their
farm when they were little.

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.860
He drives over toward the farm and on the
way sees a landfill, named Dry Run.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.740
The man takes him inside of his house and
immediately starts showing him abnormal organs

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.250
taken from his cattle, which show sickness
and deformations.

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.909
Next, he takes him to a creek where his animals
drink the water, showing him strange white

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:42.600
rocks inside, saying those are some kind of
chemicals that are poisoning his cattle.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.159
Rob turns around and sees only two cows.

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:48.759
The man takes him to the rest of cattle buried
in an adjacent field.

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:50.740
He's lost hundreds of cows.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.870
Rob is concerned to learn that DuPont, the
chemical company which owns the landfill,

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.950
hasn't explained anything to the man, nor
reacted to any of his worries about the chemicals

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.259
in the creek.

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:03.900
Rob attends a work dinner with the president
of the DuPont company, which his firm has

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.340
been a friend off for a long time.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.860
After dinner he goes up to the president and
asks him about the landfill.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.909
The president diplomatically ends the conversation,
saying he will surely look into the matter.

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:19.510
Some time later, Rob comes back to the man's
farm and brings him an evaluation.

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.609
The report of the farm and cattle says that
the animals had died from inadequate care,

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:26.530
which angers the farmer, who's convinced otherwise.

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.889
As they argue, one of the cows starts behaving
strangely and is about to charge on them.

00:02:30.889 --> 00:02:33.329
Rob gets in the truck and the man stays back.

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:35.549
The cow charges and he shoots her.

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:39.689
Later, Rob drives back through the town and
notices that the entire place is owned by

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:41.370
the chemical company.

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.650
Back at the office, he shows his boss the
video tapes the farmer left there and explains

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.870
the situation, asking to take the case for
free and help him out, because the local lawyers

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.629
are afraid of the company.

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:55.569
His boss reluctantly agrees, but tells him
to keep the case on point.

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:59.239
That day Rob has a telephone call with the
president of the company, telling him that

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:02.510
he's suing them and asking for more reports
on the landfill.

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.769
He's told that he'll get the reports.

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:05.769
The president doesn't sound too concerned
about the case and tells Rob he forgives him

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:06.769
for suing.

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:07.769
The report arrives one year later.

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:10.579
Rob is missing a party at his own house going
through the documents.

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:14.809
He finds different things inside that look
suspicious, with the acronym PFOA showing

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:16.489
up multiple times.

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:20.219
He searches for its meaning back at the office,
with no results.

00:03:20.219 --> 00:03:23.239
One of his colleagues comes in and they talk
about the case.

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:27.099
Rob is worried that the company is doing something
illegal and hiding it, dumping chemicals which

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:30.609
they are not disclosing to the Environmental
Protection Agency.

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:33.730
His colleague doesn't know what P.F.O.A. stands
for either.

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.109
Meanwhile, the president starts dodging his
calls.

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:41.809
Later that night, Rob attends the Ohio Chemical
Alliance Awards dinner with his wife.

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:45.669
He looks for the president of DuPont throughout
the event and when he finally sees him, he

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:47.389
goes over to confront him.

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:51.329
The man is angry and makes a scene that doesn't
go well with Rob's wife, who's concerned if

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:53.669
Rob knows who he's going up against.

00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:58.119
The next day, Rob's boss is furious with him
for making the case a big deal.

00:03:58.119 --> 00:04:01.040
Court ordered documents for the case arrive
at the office.

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.159
DuPont is trying to burry Rob in materials
and reports, but he's determined to find out

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:08.569
what is going on, so he starts going through
them alone.

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:12.659
He finds the acronym PFOA again, with the
addition of C8.

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:16.829
Meanwhile, the farmers are getting slack back
in their town for suing the chemical company,

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:19.419
because it's the top employer in the area.

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:22.560
Rob meets with a chemist to ask him about
the things he's found.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.689
The chemist tells him that he hasn't heard
of PFOA, but something similar.

00:04:26.689 --> 00:04:29.910
It stands for a synthetic compound made in
a lab.

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.659
When Rob asks him what would happen if the
compound is ingested, the chemist can't believe

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:37.979
the question, saying that's like asking what
would happen if you ingest a tire.

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:42.470
One more year later, Rob is getting deeper
in the case, as he realizes that DuPont isn't

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:45.310
just poisoning cattle, but the people as well.

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:48.500
The chemical he's found on the document is
in the town's water.

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.990
He finds documents that confirm the suspicion.

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:55.720
Meanwhile, back in West Virginia, the farmer
that called Rob is seeing a doctor, because

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.750
he's been sick for a long time.

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:01.690
When he gets back home with his wife, they
find out that their documents have been ransacked

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:03.949
and the samples from the cattle stolen.

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:07.939
DuPont is threatening them and the farmer
is desperate to protect his family.

00:05:07.939 --> 00:05:11.660
Soon after, Rob makes an even more terrifying
discovery.

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:16.889
Rob is back home and he tells his wife that
DuPont is poisoning everyone, their baby included.

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:20.139
His wife doesn't want to accept it, but he
explains it to her.

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:25.240
The chemical he's been investigating was created
during the Manhattan project in WW2.

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:29.930
After the war, some companies realized that
they can use the same chemical in other products.

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:31.490
DuPont was one of them.

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:36.189
They took the chemical, renamed it C8 and
made a coating for pans called Teflon.

00:05:36.189 --> 00:05:40.419
The coating is made in a factory in West Virginia
and the company knew it was poisonous dating

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:42.229
back from the 60s.

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:46.009
Rob tells his boss the same information about
DuPont and the way in which they tried to

00:05:46.009 --> 00:05:49.090
cover up the toxic C8 sludge over the years.

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:52.870
He's discovered that the company not only
knew, but made experiments that had shown

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:56.310
deformations in monkeys and rats, as well
as their offspring.

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:59.990
DuPont knew the same thing was happening with
their workers and their babies, but covered

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:01.050
that up as well.

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:05.499
The company knew what the product and byproducts
were doing, not just to their workers, but

00:06:05.499 --> 00:06:07.930
to the consumers of the products as well.

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:11.379
And the product was everywhere, from pans
to paints and fabrics.

00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:15.699
Rob's wife goes into labor and when the baby
is born, he asks the nurses if it has any

00:06:15.699 --> 00:06:19.699
visible deformations, like the ones he's read
about in the files.

00:06:19.699 --> 00:06:21.680
They tell him the baby is perfect.

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:25.460
After some time, Rob and his boss confront
the president of DuPont.

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:29.680
He tells him he knows everything about C8
and how far the contamination has gotten.

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:32.800
Later, he informs the farmer about it as well.

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:36.319
The farmer doesn't want to settle in a civil
case, thinking that the world needs to know

00:06:36.319 --> 00:06:38.230
what the company has done.

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:42.460
Rob tells him that there is no way to fight
the company in court since they're too powerful.

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:46.370
They argue and the farmer tells him that both
him and his wife have cancer.

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:50.009
Nevertheless, Rob convinces him to take the
settlement and they sign the papers with the

00:06:50.009 --> 00:06:51.389
president of the company.

00:06:51.389 --> 00:06:56.349
But, in the meantime Rob has leaked all the
information about DuPont to the relevant institutions

00:06:56.349 --> 00:07:00.080
and has signed up to testify in the case that
those governmental departments have filed

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:01.580
against the company.

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:05.370
His boss is furious with him, but wishes him
good luck in Washington.

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:09.610
Later, Rob is seen testifying there, asking
the departments to do something about the

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:12.199
situation with the contamination.

00:07:12.199 --> 00:07:16.690
One year later in 2001, Rob, his wife and
one of his colleagues are called in the home

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:19.590
of the Kigers, who've gotten a letter from
DuPont.

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:22.990
The couple tells them about their family members
that have worked for the company and died

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:27.249
of cancer, but also about other people they
have known suffering the same fate.

00:07:27.249 --> 00:07:31.520
The latest information prompts Rob to present
his law firm with a potential Class Action

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:35.830
Case, in which they would be representing
the people directly hurt by the company.

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:40.009
He bases the case around a legal loophole
that DuPont have set themselves, based on

00:07:40.009 --> 00:07:42.370
self-regulation and medical monitoring.

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:45.740
The partners in the firm are divided with
some thinking that the company isn't in the

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:48.250
wrong and others staying on Rob's side.

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:52.169
The boss of the firm defends Rob and the case,
arguing they should do the right thing and

00:07:52.169 --> 00:07:54.360
nail DuPont for their crime.

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:59.400
The next year, the case finally goes to court,
together with Harry Dietzler on Rob's side.

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:03.770
DuPont files a motion to dismiss the case,
since new regulations about contamination

00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:08.479
have been put in place over night, changing
the course of Dietzer and Rob's legal case.

00:08:08.479 --> 00:08:12.229
The official that's there to testify is seen
sitting next to the president of the company

00:08:12.229 --> 00:08:16.539
and later is accused by Dietzer that she might
as well be working for them.

00:08:16.539 --> 00:08:21.900
One more year later, Teflon becomes a popular
topic on the news in America and in the world.

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:25.680
With more and more alarming information coming
to light about the substance.

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:29.260
The Kigers also get threatened, when one of
their houses gets burned down.

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.930
They were lucky enough that was the empty
one.

00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:34.099
Another year later the battle continues.

00:08:34.099 --> 00:08:38.149
The chairman of the DuPont company is being
deposed by Rob for the case.

00:08:38.149 --> 00:08:43.120
Rob confronts him with the evidence about
C8 from the 70's, listing diseases like cancer,

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:46.800
infertility and many others that have been
shown to be caused by the chemical.

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:50.790
He continues to show him documents about their
own experiments they've been trying to hide

00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:53.019
and deny doing in the first place.

00:08:53.019 --> 00:08:56.959
The defendant's attorneys are ready to leave
the deposition, when Rob shows the chairman

00:08:56.959 --> 00:08:59.240
a picture of a deformed child.

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:03.029
Rob leaves the office and starts going toward
his car, panicking.

00:09:03.029 --> 00:09:07.269
He starts the car slowly, terrified that it
might have been rigged with a bomb.

00:09:07.269 --> 00:09:12.330
Some time later, DuPont has been fined by
the EPA to pay 16 million in damages.

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:16.140
But the damages the company needs to pay to
the Class Suit members is being mediated by

00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:20.889
a third party, which implements an independent
science panel to determine the medical monitoring

00:09:20.889 --> 00:09:22.710
aspect of the lawsuit.

00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:25.949
That day, Rob and his two colleagues are celebrating.

00:09:25.949 --> 00:09:29.920
One of them is very suspicious about the outcome
from the science panel, thinking the people

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:33.769
from the case won't show up for their examinations
and will take money from a settlement with

00:09:33.769 --> 00:09:35.050
DuPont.

00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:38.680
Rob comes up with the idea to check their
blood first and give them their money after

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:43.199
that, so they can show what the company has
done and stop their actions in the future.

00:09:43.199 --> 00:09:48.300
Some years later, the blood tests are ongoing
as Rob drives into the West Virginian town.

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:51.750
Many people have gathered to be tested at
a mobile laboratory.

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:56.230
Rob walks inside and is greeted by the doctor,
who tells him that his plan worked.

00:09:56.230 --> 00:10:01.449
Interestingly, a woman who is getting a test,
still believes that DuPont haven't done anything.

00:10:01.449 --> 00:10:04.699
It's Christmas and Rob is celebrating with
friends and family.

00:10:04.699 --> 00:10:09.340
He gets a call from his colleague, informing
him that 69 thousand people have been tested,

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:12.070
gathering an insane amount of data they needed.

00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:16.250
Eleven years since the beginning of the case,
the farmer has died and Rob attends his funeral

00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:17.759
with his family.

00:10:17.759 --> 00:10:21.980
After the funeral, they go to a local diner,
when a man approaches them and tells Rob that

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:24.449
his brother has also died from cancer.

00:10:24.449 --> 00:10:28.779
They leave and drive by the unemployment office,
where many people can be seen, some of them

00:10:28.779 --> 00:10:30.230
angry with Rob.

00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:34.040
Later, the Krigers call him to tell him that
they have trouble with the locals blaming

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:37.820
them for being part of the case, angry that
the case seems endless.

00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:41.700
The wait for the results of the analysis of
the data is taking forever.

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:46.040
One more year later, Rob is seen having breakfast
with his wife and three sons.

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:50.269
The kids leave for school and he wonders if
they can still afford their catholic school.

00:10:50.269 --> 00:10:54.089
His wife gets angry with him because he has
been obsessing with the case for so long and

00:10:54.089 --> 00:10:57.180
has no idea what has been going on with their
family.

00:10:57.180 --> 00:10:58.610
She storms out.

00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:01.899
Later that day, Rob argues with his boss about
the case.

00:11:01.899 --> 00:11:05.600
He explains that all the other governmental
instances have given up on the problem with

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:09.519
DuPont and that this case is the only thing
left that can fight the company.

00:11:09.519 --> 00:11:14.269
As they argue, Rob starts shaking uncontrollably,
while his boss informs him that he will receive

00:11:14.269 --> 00:11:15.870
another pay cut.

00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:18.290
Rob gets a seizure and falls on the ground.

00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:21.110
They take him to a hospital and are performing
tests.

00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:24.470
Later, his wife and boss are there waiting
for the results.

00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:28.990
A doctor comes in and explains that he has
had some kind of neurological problem.

00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:32.839
When she leaves, Rob's wife and boss have
a conversation in which she tells him that

00:11:32.839 --> 00:11:36.480
he needs to start treating him properly, because
he has been fighting in a way none of the

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:38.440
two can understand.

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:41.350
One more year later, the family is seen in
a church.

00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:46.259
After, they go to a gas station when Rob finally
meets Bucky, the deformed child from the pictures

00:11:46.259 --> 00:11:48.300
he's been seeing all these years.

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:50.750
The next day, he goes to the office.

00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:51.790
He looks devastated.

00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:53.170
Defeated even.

00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:57.570
He's seen sitting on his desk, when he hears
his phone ringing and answers.

00:11:57.570 --> 00:12:02.100
The call is from the doctor from the science
panel, instituted seven years before.

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:06.079
She informs him that the data has finally
been analyzed and it shows the precise link

00:12:06.079 --> 00:12:09.660
of the DuPont contamination to six categories
of serious illness.

00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:14.740
Thanks to his work, the people that might
get sick can seek compensation from the company.

00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:16.410
Rob appears to have won.

00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:18.480
He drives home and tells his family the news.

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:22.779
They are seen celebrating in a restaurant,
when Rob gets another call.

00:12:22.779 --> 00:12:24.500
The news he gets is terrible.

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:27.699
DuPont is fighting against the findings of
the science panel.

00:12:27.699 --> 00:12:30.290
He thinks it's over, that he's lost.

00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:33.940
Companies like DuPont always win and the little
people always lose.

00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:35.889
So it's those people he needs to protect.

00:12:35.889 --> 00:12:37.160
It's 2015.

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:40.820
A court adjourns and the judge takes his seat.

00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:43.529
Rob stands up to plead the case of his clients.

00:12:43.529 --> 00:12:55.069
After wining 3 and settling 3,535 cases, Rob
Billot is still fighting.
