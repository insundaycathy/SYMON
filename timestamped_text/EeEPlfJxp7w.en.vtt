00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:05.060
Welcome back to Movie Recaps.Today I will
show you a crime, thriller, horror film from

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.590
2016, entitled Don't Breathe.

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:08.680
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.150
Watch out and take care.

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:14.870
An old man is dragging a young woman by the
hair trough a street that seems to be part

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:16.700
of an abandoned neighborhood.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:21.480
A group of young people, two men and a woman,
unlock a door from a fancy house.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.020
One of them stops the alarm before it can
go off.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:28.029
The same person, who looks the most nervous,
repeats their rules as they enter the house

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:32.410
- about not taking any cash and grabbing only
things that are below 10G's.

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:34.660
They are in and out of the house fast.

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.480
Before they leave, they switch the alarm back
on and break the front door window, which

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.920
activates the alarm sound as they escape.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.690
Later, they're driving in their car, smoking
pot, chatting.

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.399
The nervous guy starts telling the other two
about another of their friends that's leaving

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:49.399
town.

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:51.899
They don't seem phased, saying everyone leaves
Detroit.

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.680
Even they were planning to leave for California
after the next robbery, with no plans of coming

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:57.680
back.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.690
The girl tells the nervous guy to come with
them, but he says he can't leave his dad.

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.719
They drop him of at his house, he goes in
and heads straight to his dad's study room,

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:09.670
where he opens a drawer and returns the key
from the house they just robbed.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.659
His dad works in home security.

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:15.770
The third guy, called Money, goes to fence
the things they got in the robbery and doesn't

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.429
get as much as he hoped.

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:20.829
He argues a little with the guy that buys
the things from him, but the guy tells him

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:23.549
that if he wants money, he should steal money.

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.950
He gives him a tip about a new job.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.920
Money tells his friends all about it.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.130
It's a house that belongs to a loner veteran,
secured by the nervous guys' dad, and is in

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.340
a part of the city that's abandoned.

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.869
That doesn't raise to much confidence in the
other two, so Money explains why they should

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:38.959
rob it.

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:43.119
Apparently, the vets daughter was ran over
by a rich girl and her family gave him a huge

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:45.469
settlement of at least 300K.

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:49.810
The girl goes along with the idea much easier
than the nervous guy, Alex.

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.450
He's worried about the consequences of grabbing
such a large amount, to both them and his

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:54.810
dad's company.

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.099
He walks away.

00:01:56.099 --> 00:02:00.689
Later that day, the girl - Rocky, sends Alex
a text message begging him to do the job for

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.850
her so she could get someone out.

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.849
While Alex researches the vet, Rocky is at
home with her little sister, her mom and her

00:02:06.849 --> 00:02:08.429
mom's new boyfriend.

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.289
Him and her mom are horrible.

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.431
It becomes apparent that the message Rocky
sent Alex was clearly about her sister, when

00:02:14.431 --> 00:02:17.840
she starts asking her if she wants to go to
California with her.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.230
She want to get her sister out of their terrible
family situation.

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.350
Alex, Rocky and Money go to steak out the
vets house and neighborhood.

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.069
Alex and Rocky remain in the car alone.

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:31.660
She shares a story from her childhood with
him and Alex tells her that he will come with

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.459
them to California when they finish the job.

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:38.500
Money comes back in the car and confirms what
they knew about the house, when a Rottweiler

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.700
dog jumps at the girls window.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.409
An old man calls for the dog and Money tells
them that that is the vet.

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:48.770
They realize he's blind and have a small argument
about how unethical it would be to rob a blind

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:49.939
guy.

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:52.329
That night, they come back to the neighborhood.

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:54.319
The lights are off in the vets house.

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:58.209
They take care of the dog first by feeding
it meat with some kind of drug.

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:01.840
When they go to open the front door, they
realize that the keys Alex had taken from

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.159
his dad's security company don't work.

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:08.379
They check for a side door or a window, but
find only a small window which only Rocky

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:09.829
can go trough.

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:14.239
She enters the house and manages to stop the
alarm with a remote that Alex gives her.

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:17.239
She sees framed pictures of the vets dead
daughter on the mantle.

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:20.909
Meanwhile, Alex and Money are waiting for
her to let them in.

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:24.870
Once inside the house they start going trough
it, looking for the safe with the money.

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.930
Rocky looks trough the closet.

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.040
Money goes on the next floor to chloroform
the old vet, so he doesn't wake up.

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.879
He finds him sleeping in his room with the
sounds of a video of his daughter playing,

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:36.340
when she was a child.

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.909
The vet wakes up and turns off the TV, but
Money manages to set of the gas.

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:44.849
He comes down and the three of them find a
bolted door, thinking the money must be stashed

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:46.370
somewhere behind it.

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.010
Money takes out a gun and thinking that the
vet is sleeping, blasts the bolt from the

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:51.010
door.

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.510
Alex, frightened about how having a gun there
changes things, decides to leave.

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:58.049
He takes his shoes from the stack and goes.

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:02.670
Money and Rocky open the door, but the vet
appears out of nowhere, asking who's there.

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:06.470
The two of them fall silent, but he hears
Money and starts following his voice as he

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:09.659
tries to first lie to and then reason with
the old man.

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:12.880
He shoots at him once to scare him, but that
doesn't stop him.

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.959
Alex hears the shot outside.

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:18.310
The vet grabs the gun from his hands and shoots
him in the head.

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.449
He doesn't know the girl is there too.

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:21.989
She hides in the closet.

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:25.780
Alex walks into the house and almost bumps
into the vet, nevertheless dodging him as

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.890
he runs around the house bolting the doors
and the windows.

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:31.430
He hides in the bathroom and texts with Rocky.

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:34.610
She tells him where she's hiding and he goes
after her.

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.610
Before Alex gets there though, the vet comes
into the closet, takes a part of the dry wall

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:43.080
to reveal the safe, enters his code, which
is fully visible to Rocky, and checks if the

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.630
money's all there.

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:49.170
After he finds out that it hasn't been taken,
he closes the safe and walks of, still unaware

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:51.550
that Rocky is inside the closet too.

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.970
Alex comes in the closet and suggests they
should call the cops.

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:56.470
Rocky disagrees.

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:59.630
She opens the safe and takes the money, to
his surprise.

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:02.210
Alex thinks there are a million dollars there.

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:05.580
They decide to leave trough the door that
was bolted, thinking it would lead them trough

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.650
the basement and to a hatch that leads to
the yard.

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:12.199
Before they could go trough the door, the
vet appears from inside and begins dragging

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:15.030
Money's body to a different part of the house.

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:19.099
After a little scare, he continues doing what
he was doing, which gives them ample space

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:20.770
to run trough the door.

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:24.510
At this point he still doesn't know that they're
there, until moments later when he finds their

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:25.510
shoes.

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:28.610
He goes to check on the safe and realizes
the money is gone.

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:31.880
Meanwhile, Alex and Rocky are going trough
the basement.

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:34.830
They are shocked to find a girl roped up with
army cords.

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:38.900
The moment she moves, a ring attached to her
notifies the vet that there is something going

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:39.900
on in the basement.

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:44.080
While there, Alex and Rocky find out that
the girl is the same one that ran over his

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:45.080
daughter.

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.039
Rocky decides to help her, no matter what
she had done.

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:51.510
They try to go trough the basement hatch,
but the vet is waiting for them in front of

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:53.110
it and starts shooting.

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:55.410
He kills the girl that killed his daughter.

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:59.430
As Alex and Rocky are running, the vet is
calling to his baby, saying that his baby

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:02.410
is dead, while holding the body of the dead
girl.

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:06.940
He then chases after them in the huge basement,
after he turns off the electricity.

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:11.680
Since they are also blinded in a way, he almost
manages to catch them and strangle Alex, but

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:14.340
the guy escapes with Rocky again.

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:18.740
Outside of the basement, the Rottweiler, who
is now fully awake, is waiting for them.

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:23.100
The dog chases after them on the second floor
and corners them in one of the rooms.

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:26.360
The windows there are barred and it seems
that they have no way to escape.

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:30.300
Meanwhile, the vet catches up to them and
is outside of the room with his dog and a

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:31.349
gun.

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:35.479
Rocky and Alex try to find a way to escape,
when she sees a vent on the wall.

00:06:35.479 --> 00:06:38.660
He tells her to go trough it and that he will
keep the door safe.

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:43.389
As she enters the vent, the old man and the
dog break trough the doors and attack Alex.

00:06:43.389 --> 00:06:47.289
He falls trough the window onto a celling
window, one level down.

00:06:47.289 --> 00:06:51.189
Back at the room, the dog follows Rocky in
the vent by her smell and chases after her

00:06:51.189 --> 00:06:52.729
trough the shaft.

00:06:52.729 --> 00:06:55.449
She jumps into a vertical shaft to escape
it.

00:06:55.449 --> 00:06:59.610
The vet realizes where Alex is and shoots
the window, hurling him down on the first

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:00.610
floor.

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:04.580
Alex runs again, but he catches up to him
in the room where he keeps his gardening tools

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:06.870
and where he had stashed Money's body.

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:10.669
He beats Alex unconscious and stabs him with
giant gardening scissors.

00:07:10.669 --> 00:07:13.680
Rocky wakes up in the shaft, hurt and in pain.

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:17.650
She starts crawling trough the vents again
when she spots two openings - one going down

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:20.250
in the house and the other outside the house.

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:24.069
As she tries to break trough the bars at the
opening leading outside of the house, the

00:07:24.069 --> 00:07:25.960
vet grabs her from the other one.

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:27.950
Rocky wakes up in the basement.

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:30.629
She's tied up the same way as the other girl
was.

00:07:30.629 --> 00:07:34.690
The vet is there and she begs him to let her
go, saying she won't tell anyone about the

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:35.690
girl.

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:40.039
He explains, however, that holding the girl
in the basement wasn't about torture or punishment

00:07:40.039 --> 00:07:42.039
for what she had done to his daughter.

00:07:42.039 --> 00:07:46.110
It was his crazy idea that, since she took
his child from him, it would only be fair

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:48.490
she should give him a child in return.

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:51.810
He'd been holding her there because she was
pregnant with his baby.

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:56.009
With his insane logic, he comes to the conclusion
that Rocky is to blame for her death and she

00:07:56.009 --> 00:07:57.810
should be held accountable.

00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:00.060
In the meantime, Alex wakes up.

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:02.810
The vet hadn't stabbed him, but Money's body.

00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:04.810
He tricks the dog into the room and locks
it in.

00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:07.830
Then, he unlocks the front door.

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:10.669
Back in the basement, the vet is heating something
up.

00:08:10.669 --> 00:08:14.380
He tells Rocky that she would now have to
bear his child in the girls stead.

00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:18.780
But since his not a rapist, he wouldn't force
himself on her, just his sperm.

00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:22.819
It's revealed that he was heating up his sperm,
so he could inject it in her.

00:08:22.819 --> 00:08:26.469
Fortunately, Alex bursts into the basement
at the right moment and the vet is unable

00:08:26.469 --> 00:08:28.610
to do what he wanted to do to Rocky.

00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:32.810
Alex chains the vet up and releases Rocky,
who kicks the heck out of the old man, among

00:08:32.810 --> 00:08:33.980
other things.

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:37.900
Alex tells Rocky that calling the police now
is out of the question, that they should just

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:40.290
leave the vet chained up in the basement.

00:08:40.290 --> 00:08:44.020
The two of them take the money and leave the
basement, going to the front door.

00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:48.880
The moment Alex opens the door he gets shot
by the vet, who succeeded in breaking free.

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:52.250
It's already daylight outside, as Rocky starts
to run.

00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:54.850
The vet sends his Rottweiler after her.

00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:57.610
After a long chase, she finally gets to Money's
car.

00:08:57.610 --> 00:09:01.930
But when the dog catches up to her she drops
the bag with the money outside.

00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:05.880
Moreover, once in the car she realizes that
she doesn't have the key.

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:10.320
Rocky traps the dog inside the car in a clever
way, but as soon as she is out and grabs the

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:14.740
bag, the vet grabs her again and starts pulling
her toward his house by her hair.

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:18.290
When they get there, Rocky finds the remote
for the alarm and activates it.

00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:23.130
The sound completely disorients the vet and
she manages to push him down in the basement.

00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:26.800
Thinking that he's dead, she grabs the money
and runs, as the police is pulling over to

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:28.150
the house.

00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:31.480
Rocky is sitting with her little sister in
the bar of an airport.

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:35.890
She hears the news on the bar TV, with the
news anchor talking about what had happened.

00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:37.800
The vet had survived the fall.

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:41.960
However, he didn't mention the fact that she
was involved in the robbery as well, or that

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:43.350
the money was missing.

00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:51.770
Rocky is free to live her best life with her
sister 

00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:53.430
in California.

00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:55.010
Maybe.
