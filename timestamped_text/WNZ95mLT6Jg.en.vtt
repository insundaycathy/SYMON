the film opens by describing the&nbsp;
legend of the tears of the moon&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.920
they are magic petals that come from a&nbsp;
special tree that comes with healing powers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.800
sometime in the mid-sixteenth century spanish&nbsp;
conquistadors led by don lopez aguirre made a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:30.720
voyage to the amazon to seek the tree out aguirre&nbsp;
loses most of his men and is left on his own the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.480
legend states that he was found by local villagers&nbsp;
and later condemned to be a prisoner of the jungle&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:44.800
london 1916 mcgregor houghton is attempting&nbsp;
to convince a royal society of explorers to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.600
fund an expedition to find the tears of the&nbsp;
moon for research and medicinal purposes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.200
but the group sees it as a waste&nbsp;
of time and is only based on a myth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.600
mcgregor's sister lily sneaks out while he stalls&nbsp;
the group as she goes to the archives of the group

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:14.160
she manages to find a crate containing a special&nbsp;
arrowhead that is the key to finding the tears&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:19.840
of the moon but also seeking it is german&nbsp;
aristocrat prince joachim someone got to it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:27.600
before me lily almost makes it out until joachim&nbsp;
calls her out she tries to escape on a ladder but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:39.840
joachim almost causes her to fall until mcgregor&nbsp;
stops a bus to let her drop and make her get away

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.520
after they get away joachim kills the other men&nbsp;
in the room when his identity is revealed and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:03.440
the curator of the archives tells him who lily is&nbsp;
is that woman i don't know who that was meanwhile&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:09.600
lily and mcgregor make plans to find the tears&nbsp;
of the moon or lagrimas del cristal on their own

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.960
in south america a tour guide named frank wolf&nbsp;
is taking a group of people on a ride across&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.680
the river in his boat named l'aquila which&nbsp;
is comprised of a bunch of tricks that frank&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:30.880
had set up he also engages in many lame puns to&nbsp;
the chagrin of the passengers only two can play

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:41.040
and play not one but two can play the boa&nbsp;
constrictor right there is capable of eating&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.160
up to 500 pounds per sitting personally i&nbsp;
find that very hard and don't interrupt me&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.640
like that again i will feed you to the boat&nbsp;
she is a small child he loves small children&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:58.800
i hope those aren't the deadliest hunters in&nbsp;
the hemisphere they hunt humans please go faster

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.600
frank manages to steer them&nbsp;
clear of the danger in the waters

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.120
lily and mcgregor arrive nearby&nbsp;
to seek out nilo nemolato&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.360
a harbour master that will provide them with&nbsp;
the boat that they need to take their voyage&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:23.760
based on a map that lily has carried that will&nbsp;
take them to the tree nilo finds frank who owes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.960
him money and when he doesn't have enough he&nbsp;
takes the engine from frank's boat as collateral&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.160
frank sneaks into nilo's office when he&nbsp;
is out to try and get the engine back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.800
and lily goes up to the office thinking she&nbsp;
is talking to nilo i have a lot of money

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.720
but frank tricks her and attempts to convince&nbsp;
her to hire him for the expedition to the tree&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:54.320
to turn back first out of the rapids well i look&nbsp;
forward to disappointing you this almost works&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.320 --> 00:04:01.280
until mcgregor appears with the actual nilo and&nbsp;
lily starts to make her leave the bar they are in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:13.840
is then terrorized by a jaguar which frank manages&nbsp;
to get to leave the building with a piece of meat

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.160
this convinces lily and mcgregor to join frank

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.400
frank leads lily and mcgregor to his boat&nbsp;
as he attempts to put the engine back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:44.160
lily is captured by bird poachers hired by&nbsp;
joachim but she manages to pick a lock and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:49.920
free herself just as his henchmen pursue&nbsp;
her frank and mcgregor attempt to outrun&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:56.320
nelo's men as they start to ride the boat out they&nbsp;
managed to catch up with lily and get her onto the

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:14.240
how nice boat you to join us but joachim&nbsp;
learns that the heroes are getting away&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:23.840
so he emerges from his submarine and attacks them

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:30.800
what did i just

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.040
he fires a torpedo at them but&nbsp;
frank drives the boat through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:39.920
an old building as the torpedo passes under them

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:47.120
frank gets them out of there while the&nbsp;
submarine trashes nilo's other boats&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:51.840
and nilo watches his business literally go under

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:05.680
on the boat ride frank cracks jokes at the&nbsp;
siblings expense but he spends more time with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:12.080
them lily shows him a video camera while they pass&nbsp;
through the river with mythical dolphin creatures&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:18.640
later the siblings discover that the jaguar&nbsp;
from earlier is frank's pet named proxima&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:24.960
which he used as a pawn to convince&nbsp;
them to hire him lily is upset and angry

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:33.280
joachim and his men find an underground&nbsp;
cavern where aguirre and his men are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:39.040
imprisoned within the earth of the jungle&nbsp;
using river water joachim frees the snakes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:43.600
that are part of aguero's body to request&nbsp;
his services in seeking out the arrowhead&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:50.720
aguirre agrees and joachim's men flood the cavern&nbsp;
with river water to reawaken the conquistadors

00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:00.160
the trio come across rough waters&nbsp;
and nearly go over a huge waterfall&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:15.840
but frank manages to get them on a path to safety

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:42.720
they make it to land and stop for a moment lily&nbsp;
goes through frank's quarters while he talks with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:48.640
mcgregor who reveals to frank that he was disowned&nbsp;
by his family and from society because he is gay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:53.680
and lily was the only one who stood by his side&nbsp;
even if she can come off a bit rough around the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:59.760
edges at times lily comes across several&nbsp;
maps of the tree among frank's belongings&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:04.080
leading to a confrontation where she&nbsp;
accuses him of seeking the tree for himself

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:13.040
not for a long long time okay yes moments&nbsp;
later the three are knocked out by darts

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:30.000
the three find themselves captive to a native&nbsp;
tribe frank speaks their language and attempts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.200
to deal with them as they request the arrowhead&nbsp;
what did you say i said that they should let you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:40.080
and your brother mcgregor go lily refuses&nbsp;
to give it up and tries to make a run for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:45.200
it but it is then revealed that the tribe&nbsp;
know who frank is and take part in his ruse&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:54.160
lily is infuriated with his constant deception and&nbsp;
mcgregor follows suit in punching him in the face&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:54.160 --> 00:09:00.400
after cooling down lily talks to the tribe leader&nbsp;
trader sam to figure out how to decipher the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:05.120
arrowhead which gives them the location of&nbsp;
the tree and explains that the tree blooms&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:10.800
in a blood moon the tribe is then attacked&nbsp;
by aguirre and his men who have been bound&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:15.760
to the jungle for so long that they have become&nbsp;
monsters that manipulate creatures like bees and

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:21.840
snakes

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:38.000
get it hold on come on i don't got it

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:46.640
just leave me alone that was a disaster you're too&nbsp;
heavy they nearly get the arrowhead but frank gets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:52.160
his hands on it at the expense of being impaled&nbsp;
by aguirre's blade and thrown from a great height

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:05.040
lily runs away with it and makes it&nbsp;
far enough because the conquistadors&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:07.840
are pulled back since they&nbsp;
cannot go beyond the river

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:20.400
in the morning lily finds mcgregor and frank alive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:27.200
if you're alive i'm never leaving kensington&nbsp;
again yeah little something in your bag

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:37.920
it is then that he reveals to lily that he is&nbsp;
nearly 400 years old out the back it's like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:45.840
like that no no no no no no no no no gosh&nbsp;
that hurts no it doesn't how do you nervous

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:54.480
he was previously known as francisco and was the&nbsp;
cartographer on a wirey's voyage as they had grown&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:54.480 --> 00:11:00.320
up together like brothers aguirre sought out&nbsp;
the tears of the moon to cure his sick daughter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:05.600
after most of their men were lost on the&nbsp;
voyage they were found by the villagers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:12.240
who used the petals of the tree to heal frank&nbsp;
and aguirre and the remaining men aguirre became&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:17.600
impatient and demanded the tribe's chief tell&nbsp;
him where to find the tree but he was deemed not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:24.000
worthy and killed the chief in retribution frank&nbsp;
helped the chief's door to secure the arrowhead&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.360
and in the chief's dying breaths he curses&nbsp;
the conquistadors and dooms them to be bound&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:35.120
to the jungle and never able to leave&nbsp;
throughout the decades frank and aguirre&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:40.160
encountered each other repeatedly and fought&nbsp;
countless times so frank set up a trap to lure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:44.960
the men into the cavern away from the water&nbsp;
keeping them trapped in stone for centuries

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:53.200
frank would set up the nearby town and&nbsp;
meet many people that he would outlive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:56.480
and so he has been seeking the&nbsp;
tree to finally die in peace

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:04.640
frank and lily make the journey themselves to&nbsp;
the tree while mcgregor stays behind with sam&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:11.680
since he is injured unfortunately they are found&nbsp;
by joachim who takes mcgregor hostage and forces&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:17.200
him to help lead them to lily's location since&nbsp;
the conquistadors bees have also given them clues&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:22.720
frank and lily find the sight&nbsp;
of the tree in la luna rotor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:26.320
and lily must overcome her fear of&nbsp;
swimming to make her way underwater&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:37.840
and fit through a passage to pull a&nbsp;
switch that gets them closer to the tree

00:12:52.800 --> 00:13:05.840
after doing so the waters go down but&nbsp;
joachim arrives with mcgregor in tow

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:14.400
he makes them enter the passage and they try to&nbsp;
decipher the scripture frank and lily discover&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:19.840
that the arrowhead is meant to be a heart&nbsp;
and inside is a jewel that acts as a key

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:33.840
it brings the tree to life as&nbsp;
the moon is rising overhead

00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:01.120
joachim and his men attempt to&nbsp;
secure the petals from the tree&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:07.120
but they are thwarted by lily aguirre and his&nbsp;
men arrive and attack joachim with his snakes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:12.720
while lily runs to grab one petal as the moon is&nbsp;
passing through and the other petals quickly die&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:18.880
but she grabs the one she needs aguirre fights&nbsp;
frank on the boat as he steers it toward a wall&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:24.160
to block the river but he first tells mcgregor&nbsp;
to tell lily that she is world enough for him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:29.840
joachim comes back to attack but mcgregor&nbsp;
fights him and knocks him against a wall&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:35.520
causing a pillar to fall and crush&nbsp;
joachim not exactly what i intended&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:41.040
the boat crashes into the wall and stops the&nbsp;
water from flowing permanently imprisoning&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:48.000
aguirre and his men but frank as well lily brings&nbsp;
the petal to frank to revive him and it doesn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.840
appear to work at first but proxima raws as&nbsp;
she sees that the stone around frank crumbles&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:54.640 --> 00:15:01.760
he is alive but his immortality is gone and he&nbsp;
can now live normally he and lily share a kiss

00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:08.880
you can take the trio return to london&nbsp;
where mcgregor tells off the royal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:14.160
society to their face that he rejects&nbsp;
their application lily takes frank on a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:18.880
tour across london as she shows him how&nbsp;
to drive but he is not very good at it
