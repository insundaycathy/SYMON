Welcome back for another 5 minute movie recap.

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:05.840
Today, I'm going to give you an&nbsp;
overview of the 2020 American&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.800
supernatural horror film called 'Fantasy Island'.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.920
There will be Spoilers ahead,&nbsp;
so please proceed with caution.

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.960
Gwen Olsen, a businesswoman, Patrick&nbsp;
Sullivan, stepbrothers J. D. and Brax Weaver,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.680
and troubled Melanie Cole converge at the&nbsp;
intriguing Fantasy Island, a tropical resort where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:27.520
imaginations appear to come true, after winning&nbsp;
a sweepstakes. Mr. Roarke, the island's landlord,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.840
informs the visitors that they will each be&nbsp;
granted one dream and takes them to their wishes:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.080
J. D. and Brax are distinguished guests at&nbsp;
a mansion rave, Patrick gets enrolled in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:40.960
military in honour of his late father, Melanie&nbsp;
seeks vengeance on a childhood bully, and Gwen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.440
accepts her ex-boyfriend Allen Chambers' marriage&nbsp;
proposal, which she had previously refused.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.640
Melanie finds that her bully, Sloane Maddison,&nbsp;
was abducted and transported to the island to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.480
execute the fantasy against her will while&nbsp;
tormenting her by releasing an internet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.440
video of her cheating on her husband. They flee&nbsp;
when she protects her from a disguised surgeon.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.200
Gwen is disappointed when she discovers she&nbsp;
had a kid with Allen the following morning.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.720
Roarke comes and says that he is experiencing his&nbsp;
own fantasy of reuniting with his departed wife,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.040
and that it will be realised as long as the&nbsp;
visitors' wishes are met. Roarke is persuaded&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:18.240
by Gwen to modify her fantasy. Meanwhile,&nbsp;
Patrick is apprehended by American soldiers,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.240
who present him to Lieutenant Sullivan,&nbsp;
their commander. Although Sullivan does&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.720
not recognise him, Patrick knows that he is his&nbsp;
father, on his final assignment before dying.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.000
As night falls, the surgeon attacks Melanie and&nbsp;
Sloane once more before being murdered by Damon,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.760
an island private investigator.&nbsp;
Damon leads them to a cave,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:40.240
explaining that the fancies are caused by&nbsp;
spring water beneath a shining rock. Damon&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.560
explains that he came to investigate until Roarke&nbsp;
granted him a wish to see his dead daughter,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.600
but the fantasy turned into a&nbsp;
nightmare, trapping him on the island.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.080
The three collects some spring water before&nbsp;
proceeding to the resort to seek assistance.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.200
However, as J. D. and Brax are kidnapped by a&nbsp;
drug gang linked to the mansion's owner, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.520
Gwen is sent back to the night she inadvertently&nbsp;
set a fire that killed her neighbour Nick Taylor,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.560
Fantasy Island begins to transform the other&nbsp;
dreams into nightmares. Except for Melanie,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.280
she discovers that all of the other visitors were&nbsp;
there on the same night. Gwen attempts but fails&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.640
to save Nick, and she is saved by Julia, Roarke's&nbsp;
personal assistant. Sullivan's troops are also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:22.000
dispatched to save some captives, who turn out&nbsp;
to be J. D. and Brax. The cartel reanimates as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.440
zombies after being killed, attacking the troops.&nbsp;
J. D. is killed in the subsequent pandemonium,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.360
and Sullivan sacrifices himself so that&nbsp;
his son and Brax can return to the resort.

Melanie and Sloane are assaulted by the zombified&nbsp;
surgeon until Damon saves them by leaping over a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.760
cliff beside him. The remaining guests reunite&nbsp;
at the resort, but are confronted by Roarke,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.880
who explains that they are all being&nbsp;
slaughtered as part of someone else's dream.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.920
The visitors assume that this is Roarke's dream,&nbsp;
believing that he and Julia are Nick's parents,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.720
after realising that everyone was complicit in&nbsp;
Nick's killing. The guests flee to the pier in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.840
hopes of being rescued by an aircraft dispatched&nbsp;
by Damon's colleagues, but the plane is shot down.&nbsp;&nbsp;

With a grenade carried by Patrick, the gang&nbsp;
rushes to the cave to blast the glowing rock.

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.360
Melanie stabbings and wounds Patrick before&nbsp;
kidnapping Sloane. She confesses that this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.840
her actual fantasy, having staged the tournament&nbsp;
in order to get revenge on the guests for Nick's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.400
murder, with whom she was meant to be on a date&nbsp;
the night he died; Julia is also revealed to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.840
Roarke's wife. When Julia begins to deteriorate,&nbsp;
she persuades Roarke to assist his visitors in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.880
escaping the island before she vanishes. Sloane&nbsp;
drinks the spring water she collected earlier&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.520
and fantasises about Melanie and Nick being&nbsp;
together. Melanie is dragged into the sea&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:38.560
by Nick's zombified body as a result of this.&nbsp;
Melanie detonates the device against the guests&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.960
before drowning, but Patrick makes the ultimate&nbsp;
sacrifice by falling on it to save the others.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.920
Gwen, Sloane, and Brax wake up at the&nbsp;
resort, where Roarke offers to let them go.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.000
Brax asks for J. D. to come back to&nbsp;
life and return home as the three&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.280
survivors board a plane to leave&nbsp;
the now-purified Fantasy Island.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.840
Roarke says that in order for Brax's fantasy&nbsp;
to come true, he must remain on the island.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.440
Roarke wants Brax to be his new personal assistant&nbsp;
and to have a moniker when Gwen, Sloane, and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:11.360
now-resurrected J. D. board the plane. Brax adopts&nbsp;
the moniker 'Tattoo' after remembering a nickname&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.680
