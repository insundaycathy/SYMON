00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.680
Story Recapped here. Today, I'm&nbsp;
going to explain an adventure,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:08.480
sci-fi, thriller film called “War of the&nbsp;
Worlds.” Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.040
Ray works as a loading dock crane operator&nbsp;
in New York. He's a carefree man, enjoying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.760
his life free of responsibilities. Unfortunately,&nbsp;
Ray is also a deadbeat divorcee and the father to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.840
a teenager and a young girl. Ray heads home&nbsp;
from work and finds his ex-wife, Catherine,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.400
and her new husband waiting impatiently&nbsp;
in front of his house. It seems that Ray&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.200
has forgotten that their teenage son,&nbsp;
Robbie, and young daughter, Rachel,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.840
would be staying with him for the weekend.&nbsp;
Robbie is rude to Ray, calling Ray by his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.400
first name. Rachel is a little more excited to&nbsp;
see Ray hugging him. Catherine and her husband&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.920
accompany the kids and see that Ray's house&nbsp;
is disorganized, having no food in the fridge.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.080
Robbie and Rachel settle in their old room, and&nbsp;
Catherine informs Ray about the kids' schooling.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.880
Ray then walks Catherine out, and she informs&nbsp;
him they'll be in Boston at her parents' house.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.040
Ray assures Catherine that she&nbsp;
has nothing to worry about as he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.240
can handle a weekend with the kids.&nbsp;
Catherine leaves, and Ray listens to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.600
news reports about strange lightning storms&nbsp;
happening in different countries worldwide.

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.320
Ray invites Robbie outside to play catch, trying&nbsp;
to connect with him, but the game gets heated&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.800
when Robbie tells Ray he hates visiting him. Ray&nbsp;
accidentally breaks a window, and Robbie heads in.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.520
Rachel asks for food, but Ray decides to head to&nbsp;
bed, telling Rachel to order anything she wants.

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.400
Ray awakens a few hours later and eats with&nbsp;
Rachel. He calls out to Robbie, but Rachel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.120
tells him Robbie took Ray’s car and drove out.&nbsp;
Ray rushes outside and sees his car gone. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.400
looks around and sees people on the street&nbsp;
all staring at a swirling vortex in the sky.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.120
Ray talks to the neighbors, saying they’ve never&nbsp;
seen anything like it, especially as it’s summer.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.120
They head to the backyard to get a better look.&nbsp;
The wind starts blowing, and Ray notes that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.280
the wind is oddly blowing towards the storm.&nbsp;
Rachel joins Ray when the wind suddenly stops,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.920
and everything goes silent. Lightning then starts&nbsp;
hitting the ground. Rachel begs Ray to head back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.920
inside, and Ray takes her in as soon as he notices&nbsp;
the lightning strikes getting more frequent.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.440
They hide under the kitchen table, and Ray&nbsp;
notices they haven’t heard any thunder.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.000
The lightning keeps striking,&nbsp;
hitting the same spot every time.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.560
The lightning finally stops, and Ray looks around&nbsp;
the house to check for any damages and sees the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.880
power has gone out. He also sees his cellphone no&nbsp;
longer working, and even his watch has stopped.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.480
Ray steps outside and sees dozens&nbsp;
of cars all stopped in the middle&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:14.320
of the road. A neighbor tells Ray all of the&nbsp;
electronics are either dead or shorted out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:19.120
He runs into Robbie, apologizing, but Ray tells&nbsp;
him to head home as soon as possible. Robbie says&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.000
he was near the place where the lightning&nbsp;
hit and counted over twenty-six lightning&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.040
strikes on one spot. He passes by a mechanic shop,&nbsp;
and his mechanic friend tells him the same thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.560
Ray then suggests replacing a specific part&nbsp;
on one of the older cars to get it to work.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.920
Ray proceeds to the center of town&nbsp;
and sees a crowd gathering at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.040
place where all the lightning hit. Ray&nbsp;
joins the crowd and sees a hole on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.800
ground surrounded by cracked asphalt and&nbsp;
concrete. They hear rumbling from below,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.880
and police officers note that there are no&nbsp;
pipes, subways, or any underground infrastructure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.040
that would cause a rumble. The rumbling&nbsp;
intensifies until cracks form on the ground.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.040
The crowd steps back, but the rumbling&nbsp;
continues, and the ground begins cracking.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.960
People start running away as windows break and&nbsp;
buildings start shaking. The shaking continues&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.960
until the cracks form a massive circular disk in&nbsp;
the middle of the street. The disk rotates and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.360
implodes with a loud roar. A gigantic mechanical&nbsp;
tentacle reaches out from the smoke and rubble,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.680
stepping out of the hole. Ray narrowly escapes,&nbsp;
crawling out of the way before the tentacle drops.

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.640
The shaking pauses, and the crowd regathers at&nbsp;
the edge of the disk. A loud mechanical whirring&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.720
sound fills the air, increasing in intensity&nbsp;
until a massive machine rises from the hole.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.720
The machine erects itself on three legs,&nbsp;
towering several hundred feet. The people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.320
stare in awe as the tripod looms over them,&nbsp;
but a deafening siren comes from the machine.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.440
Appendages appear on the tripod, and a lethal heat&nbsp;
ray beams onto the people below. The crowds start&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.880
panicking and running in different directions,&nbsp;
but the machine continues its onslaught,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.160
illuminating the humans with its powerful&nbsp;
heat ray, vaporizing them in an instant.

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.680
Ray runs as fast as he can, dodging the heat ray,&nbsp;
swerving left and right. He manages to steer clear&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.920
of the tripod’s path of destruction, watching it&nbsp;
make its way through the city. Ray arrives back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.720
home in complete shock, unable to process what had&nbsp;
happened. Robbie asks Ray, but Ray remains silent.

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.120
He washes in the bathroom and composes&nbsp;
himself. He then orders Robbie to collect&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.720
as much food as possible and heads to his&nbsp;
bedroom to retrieve a gun. They head out to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.280
the mechanic shop and find a working car. They&nbsp;
get in, and the mechanic tries to stop them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.880
Ray asks his friend to get into the car with&nbsp;
them, but it appears that the mechanic has no idea&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:13.680
of what had happened. The tripod appears in the&nbsp;
distance, and Ray starts the car and speeds away.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.000
Ray drives away as the tripod&nbsp;
wreaks havoc behind them.

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.040
Ray manages to reach the highway, swerving through&nbsp;
parked cars and pedestrians. He tells Robbie that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:25.360
they’re being attacked, but Ray is in disbelief,&nbsp;
unsure how to refer to whatever is attacking them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.800
He explains the tripod came from the ground and&nbsp;
theorizes the lightning strikes could have been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.600
a means to activate the machines. Ray plans to&nbsp;
drive back to Catherine’s house but sees it empty.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.160
Ray tells them Catherine is in&nbsp;
Boston at their grandparents’ house.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.160
They head to the basement, thinking it&nbsp;
would be a safer place for them to sleep in.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.440
They try to get some rest but are awakened by&nbsp;
strange sounds and lights coming from the window.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.520
Suddenly, a loud whirring sound is&nbsp;
heard, and the ground starts trembling.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.200
They all run into a lower part of the basement,&nbsp;
closing the door as fire engulfs the basement.

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:55.600
Morning comes, and Ray goes out to see what&nbsp;
has happened. He discovers the house had been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.520
destroyed, and a massive flaming airplane&nbsp;
engine sits in the living room. He walks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.680
out and finds a massive plane crash. He sees&nbsp;
someone dragging an airplane food closet out,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.520
and a news media camera crew appears to&nbsp;
help collect the food. The reporter tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.200
Ray they were with the military, tasked&nbsp;
to document the army fighting the tripods.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:15.200
She says the tripods have a shield, rendering&nbsp;
bombs and missiles useless against them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:18.400
They’ve lost communication with cities all&nbsp;
around the world, and she shows Ray footage&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.240
of dozens of tripods decimating a city. She&nbsp;
then shows him slowed-down footage of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.960
lightning strikes revealing metal pods&nbsp;
digging into the ground every time the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.720
lightning hit. The news crew then prepares to&nbsp;
depart, leaving Ray to tend to his children.

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:33.440
Ray decides to use back roads and country&nbsp;
roads, avoiding big cities and main highways,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.360
hiding what appears to be the only working car&nbsp;
in miles. Robbie thinks they should head back and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.280
fight the invaders. They stop for a bathroom&nbsp;
break, and Rachel heads deep into the woods&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:45.200
to pee. She ends up at a riverbank where she&nbsp;
sees scores of bodies floating down the river.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:49.040
Ray arrives just in time to shield her&nbsp;
eyes, but she had already seen too much.

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:54.320
Military trucks pass by, and Robbie begs to be&nbsp;
picked up, eager to join the fight. Ray shouts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:59.040
at him, trying to dissuade him, but Robbie ignores&nbsp;
him. Robbie then gets angry with Ray, telling Ray&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:02.400
that they’re only going to Boston so that Ray can&nbsp;
leave them with Catherine, saying Ray wants to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:07.040
abandon his responsibilities as a father again.&nbsp;
Robbie finally stops when Rachel starts crying,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:10.800
asking her brother who would take care of her&nbsp;
if he leaves. They then drive away in silence.

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:15.360
They reach a ferry town, and people start&nbsp;
banging on their car, begging to be let on.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:19.280
The crowd gets more aggressive, some of them&nbsp;
getting on the car’s hood. One person throws a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:23.840
rock at the windshield, causing Ray to crash into&nbsp;
a pole. The crowd immediately swarms the vehicle,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:27.600
and Robbie and Ray get dragged out, but Rachel&nbsp;
gets trapped inside. Ray starts fighting the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:31.360
crowd and gets the upper hand when he pulls&nbsp;
out his gun and fires several warning shots.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:34.880
The crowd backs away, and Robbie steps&nbsp;
out from the crowd with a bleeding nose.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:38.560
Another man points a gun at Ray, and Ray&nbsp;
drops his gun, agreeing to give up the car.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:43.440
Ray, Robbie, and Rachel leave, but a man picks&nbsp;
up Ray’s gun and eyes the car’s new owner.

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:48.000
The three seek refuge at an abandoned diner,&nbsp;
and as the car passes, the man who had picked&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.400
up Ray’s gun shoots the man driving. Rachel sobs&nbsp;
into Robbie’s arms while Robbie watches the crowd&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:56.640
disappear with the car. The family then continues&nbsp;
on foot to the ferry docks, planning to cross the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:01.200
Hudson River to Boston. They reach a queue for&nbsp;
the ferry when one of Ray’s old friends calls him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:04.560
She’s glad to see Ray and tells him she’s&nbsp;
also trying to get her daughter to safety.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:07.920
As they talk, Rachel spots several&nbsp;
flocks of birds flying away.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:11.360
In the distance, Rachel sees the&nbsp;
trees swaying. Ray notices the crowd&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:14.400
all staring behind them, and he sees a&nbsp;
massive tripod looming over the town.

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:19.120
People start forcing their way into the ferries,&nbsp;
but the captain decides they need to leave.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:23.440
The soldiers hold people back as the ferry&nbsp;
detaches from the dock. More tripods appear,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:27.760
and people pour into the docks, desperate to&nbsp;
board the ferries. Ray sneaks past the guards, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:32.400
they board the ferry, but Ray’s friend gets left&nbsp;
behind. The ferry casts off, its engines straining&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:36.480
to accelerate. The captain thinks they’re&nbsp;
safe, but he sees lights from under the water.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:41.600
The water starts swirling, and a tripod rises from&nbsp;
the river. The tripod capsizes the ferry, dumping&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:45.680
cars and people into the river. Ray manages to&nbsp;
hold onto Robbie and Rachel, and they make their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:49.840
way to the riverbanks. As they swim away, they&nbsp;
see people getting snatched up by the tripods.

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:54.080
They reach the far end of the river and watch&nbsp;
helplessly as several tripods snatch humans up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:58.400
from the river. Then, on the opposite side,&nbsp;
more tripods appear using their heat rays&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:02.080
to vaporize the escaping civilians. The&nbsp;
family continues running into the woods.

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:06.720
The following day, they walk through the&nbsp;
countryside, joining other refugees. They&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:10.240
see explosions in the distance, and Robbie&nbsp;
hurries to get a better look. The rest of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:15.440
crowd runs to witness the fight, and fighter jets,&nbsp;
military trucks, and tanks roll in. Ray calls out,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:20.240
but Robbie ignores him. Soldiers hold Robbie and&nbsp;
other people back, and Ray catches up to him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:24.080
The soldiers are shouting orders at each&nbsp;
other, saying their firepower is ineffective.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:27.280
They resort to holding the tripods back&nbsp;
enough for civilians to get to safety.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.920
Ray tries knocking sense into Robbie, but Robbie&nbsp;
doesn’t listen, mesmerized by the gunshot and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:36.640
explosions. Rachel, who Ray left near a fallen&nbsp;
tree, watches as attack helicopters and missiles&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:41.600
dart across the sky. Ray pins Robbie down, and&nbsp;
Robbie pleads with Ray to let him go. Robbie says&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:45.600
he needs to see and be part of the initiative&nbsp;
to fight back. Ray sees Rachel approached by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:50.000
strangers and realizes he needs to let Robbie&nbsp;
go. Robbie and Ray share a look before Ray runs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.560
after Rachel. Robbie runs into the firefight&nbsp;
while Ray retrieves Rachel from the strangers.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:58.400
He then sees a massive fireball enveloping the&nbsp;
hillside before tripods rise from the inferno.

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:02.400
Ray sees a man with a shotgun inviting&nbsp;
him in for shelter and hurries.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:06.960
They take refuge in the man’s basement, escaping&nbsp;
the tripod onslaught. Ray tries to get Rachel to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:11.520
sleep, but Rachel has trouble sleeping. Ray then&nbsp;
decides to sing her a short lullaby, and Rachel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:17.600
dozes off with tears in her eyes. Ray talks with&nbsp;
the man who introduces himself as Harlan. Harlan&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:21.840
says he’s lost his whole family and tells Ray&nbsp;
he has enough water and food to last them weeks.

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:26.080
Ray then begins monologuing about how the invaders&nbsp;
had prepared for the invasion for a long time.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:29.520
The tripods had been buried thousands,&nbsp;
possibly millions of years ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:33.280
He doesn’t consider the invasion a war but&nbsp;
an extermination. Harlan says he’s not one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:37.360
to back down and tells Ray he wants to fight back.&nbsp;
Harlan reveals that he called Ray into his house&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:41.360
not to provide shelter but as an invitation&nbsp;
to join him in his fight against the tripods.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:45.040
Ray realizes he has made a grievous mistake,&nbsp;
seeing that Harlan has developed delusions,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:48.400
turning suicidal. Ray is terrified&nbsp;
that he may have accidentally brought&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:51.520
himself and Rachel into a situation&nbsp;
just as worse as facing the tripods.

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:56.240
Ray hears loud noises coming from outside and&nbsp;
sees the tripods digging through the soil.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:56.240 --> 00:10:00.400
Not long after, he notices strange red roots&nbsp;
forming all around the walls of the basement.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:04.000
He sees Harlan talking to Rachel, telling Rachel&nbsp;
he’ll take care of her if something happens to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.280
Ray. Ray takes Rachel away immediately, but before&nbsp;
they start arguing, the tripods stop making noise,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:13.280
and Ray sees an alien probe enter the basement.&nbsp;
The probe looks like a massive floating snake with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:17.360
lights at the end. Ray takes Rachel, and they&nbsp;
creep around the basement, keen to avoid the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:22.240
tripod probe. They change location multiple times,&nbsp;
hiding in different spots, and Ray sees Harlan&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:27.280
wielding an ax, ready to strike at the probe. Ray&nbsp;
begs him not to do it, and Harlan hesitates. They&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:31.840
end up hiding in a corner, using a mirror to trick&nbsp;
the probe. Finding nothing, the probe leaves.

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:36.320
Ray, Rachel, and Harlan think they’re safe,&nbsp;
but they hear something descending from above.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:40.720
Finally, they lay eyes on the creatures&nbsp;
operating the tripods. The aliens look&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:44.640
nothing like any creature on Earth, walking&nbsp;
on three legs and having smaller mandibles.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:48.560
They have big triangular heads, large&nbsp;
eyes, and are built thin and bony. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:52.080
aliens move around the basement, seemingly&nbsp;
behaving like explorers rather than hunters.

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:56.400
Harlan loads his shotgun and aims it at the&nbsp;
aliens, but Ray comes in just in time to stop him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:00.400
The two struggle, Ray is determined to keep their&nbsp;
presence hidden, and Harlan is similarly motivated&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:05.200
to kill the aliens. The booming sound of a&nbsp;
tripod siren sounds and the aliens hurry back up.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:08.400
Harlan then threatens Ray, calling&nbsp;
him a coward. He teases Ray,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:11.360
saying Ray might even prefer becoming&nbsp;
the aliens’ pet rather than fight back.

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:16.080
Not long after their close call with the aliens,&nbsp;
Harlan calls Ray, and they witness a man getting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:20.160
the blood sucked out of him. Ray realizes that&nbsp;
the strange red roots and the loud continuous&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:23.360
sound they’ve heard come from the tripods&nbsp;
using human blood to terraform the ground,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:26.720
turning it similar to whatever planet&nbsp;
they came from. Harlan runs away,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:30.000
frantically trying to dig a tunnel, shouting&nbsp;
how he’d never let the aliens get his blood.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:34.000
Ray is concerned Harlan is making too&nbsp;
much noise, but Harlan gets more frantic,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.880
shouting louder. Ray grabs Harlan, but Harlan&nbsp;
hits him with a shovel. Ray realizes Harlan&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:42.320
won’t stop screaming and decides to resort&nbsp;
to more drastic actions to keep him quiet.

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:46.640
Ray places a blindfold on Rachel, telling&nbsp;
her to hum a song and cover her ears before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:50.000
he returns to Harlan. Struggling and&nbsp;
grunting are heard from the other room,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.280
and Rachel tries her best to drown&nbsp;
out the noise. Things quiet down,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:56.720
and Ray emerges triumphant but looks as if he&nbsp;
had suffered the greatest defeat of his life.

00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:02.240
That night, Rachel has trouble sleeping. She sits&nbsp;
up and is in complete shock, going face to face&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:07.040
with the alien probe. Ray begins hacking at the&nbsp;
probe with the ax, and Rachel runs up the stairs.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:11.760
The probe retracts, but Ray discovers Rachel is&nbsp;
missing. He runs up after her, leaving the house,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:15.760
and sees the landscape covered in red tendrils&nbsp;
and roots. He heads up a hill and sees the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:19.760
tripods have terraformed a massive expanse of&nbsp;
land as far as he could see, all bathed in red.

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:25.600
A tripod appears, and Ray runs, finding cover in a&nbsp;
car. The tripod flips the car over before leaving&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:30.480
Ray and targeting Rachel instead. The tripod&nbsp;
snatches Rachel up and starts walking away. Ray&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:34.960
chases it, shouting. He finds a bundle of grenades&nbsp;
in a military car and starts throwing it at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:39.280
tripod. The grenade detonates upon hitting the&nbsp;
tripod’s shield, but it has successfully grabbed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:43.440
its attention. The tripod turns and picks up&nbsp;
Ray, depositing him in a pod with other captives.

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:48.080
The tripod appears to be carrying dozens of&nbsp;
people in pods, snatching people up at intervals,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:52.640
using their blood as fuel for the massive&nbsp;
machine. Ray finds Rachel, but she is in shock.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:56.800
A tentacle reaches down from the machine,&nbsp;
picking out another human, and it grabs Ray.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:01.280
Ray gets pulled up, but he takes the grenades&nbsp;
with him. A soldier jumps, grabbing Ray’s arm,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:05.520
trying to pull him back down. The rest of the&nbsp;
captives help, and they successfully save Ray.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:09.680
Ray spits out the pins from the grenades, and the&nbsp;
soldier tells everyone to brace for an explosion.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:13.120
The grenades detonate, causing a&nbsp;
chain of explosions inside the tripod.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:15.680
The massive machine topples&nbsp;
down, dropping its captives.

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:20.880
Ray and Rachel continue walking until they reach&nbsp;
Boston. At the city, they discover a tripod that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:25.280
had fallen, resting on the side of a building. Ray&nbsp;
asks a soldier what had happened, and according&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:29.360
to him, the tripod started moving erratically in&nbsp;
circles before falling on itself and ending up on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:33.600
the building. Ray also sees the roots covering&nbsp;
the streets have started withering and dying.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:38.080
The refugees all take caution when they hear a&nbsp;
tripod walking near. The civilians keep walking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:42.320
as the soldiers anticipate a fight. Ray spots&nbsp;
a flock of birds resting on the tripod, and he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:46.720
calls out to one of the soldiers, telling them the&nbsp;
tripod has no shields. The commander sees this and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:51.520
orders his troops to begin firing at the tripod.&nbsp;
To their surprise, the missiles hit. They start&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:56.640
firing at the tripod, giving it all they have.&nbsp;
More missiles hit, and the tripod falls. Soldiers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:56.640 --> 00:14:00.720
approach the fallen tripod, and a hatch opens&nbsp;
to reveal its dying occupant, its limbs frail.

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:03.520
Ray finally arrives at Catherine’s parents’ home,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:07.840
and he finds everyone safe. Rachel runs&nbsp;
to her mother, and, to Ray’s surprise,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:11.920
Robbie steps out of the house, unharmed.&nbsp;
The two embrace, finally reunited.

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:16.560
The invaders arrived with every intent to&nbsp;
eliminate and enslave humans, using their superior&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:20.880
technology and weaponry to bring humanity to its&nbsp;
knees. After all the weapons of man had failed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:24.240
the invaders’ end came at the hands of the&nbsp;
smallest creatures on the planet, bacteria.
