00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.179
Hi, Mystery Recapped here.

00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:07.299
Today, I'm going to explain an American psychological
thriller film called "Sightless."

00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:08.299
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:10.000
Watch out and take care!

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:17.689
The film starts with a young girl who is depressed
and alone.

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:21.210
She then decides to jump off of her apartment
balcony.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.210
The scene shifts to a month earlier, showing
that same young woman named Hellen..

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.810
Hellen used to be a famous violinist.

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.540
One night, she is brutally attacked in a car
park by an unknown attacker wearing a gas

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.250
mask, spraying chemicals on her eyes.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.150
She is then immediately brought to a hospital
and wakes up on a hospital bed, with both

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:40.750
of her eyes covered in bandages.

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.620
Soon, a nurse named Omar comes to take the
bandages off.

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.910
As the bandages are taken off, she realizes
she can't see anything.

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.550
Shortly after, a doctor named Katsuro enters
her room.

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.860
He explains that the chemicals she was exposed
to.. left her optic nerve intact, but seared.

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.560
In simple terms, the damage is irreversible,
and she is now completely blind.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.500
Having lost her eyesight forever, Ellen is
distraught and only reluctantly accepts her

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:07.650
altered situation.

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.520
Then, a detective named Bryce comes and asks
her questions about the incident.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.580
She explains to Detective Bryce what she knows.

00:01:15.613 --> 00:01:20.390
A few moments later, Ellen talks to her brother,
who is in Tokyo, on the phone.

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.090
He tells her..he has organized a hidden apartment
close to the city center for her to live in,

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.700
and a caretaker who specializes in helping
people like her who are 'adjusting to their

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.430
new lifestyle.'

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:36.180
The next day, Ellen wakes up in her new apartment
and meets her new caretaker, Clayton.

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.280
She has no memory of the trip home from the
hospital, which Clayton explains away by saying

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.680
that the drugs she is on are powerful.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.270
Clayton tells her that he is a professional
caretaker, and he will assist Ellen in her

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.560
daily activities and slowly assist her transition
as a blind person.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.240
He will come to her place every day at 11
am and leaves at 2 pm He adds that she is

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.119
now in her new apartment on the 9th floor
of the building, and he explains the layout

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.049
of the apartment to Ellen.

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.450
After Clayton leaves, Ellen tries to call
her friend, Sasha, and her brother.

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.930
But both of them do not pick up her calls.

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:11.720
She feels so empty as she has neither family
nor friends to talk to during this difficult

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:12.730
period.

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.360
The next day, Clayton brings Ellen a pet budgie
in a cage.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.440
She asks him what color it is.

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.370
Clayton tells her it's baby blue.

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.480
Afterward, Ellen notices that when she stands
next to one of her windows, she can hear the

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.440
noise from the busy street below, but when
she stands near another window, she can't

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.890
hear anything.

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.620
Clayton explains that the glass there is thicker,
so she won't be able to hear anything.

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.920
They both then talk to each other about their
lives, slowly forming a close bond between them

00:02:38.474 --> 00:02:42.970
Ellen then asks permission to touch Clayton's
face, to which he agrees.

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.160
That night, Ellen hears a woman crying while
being abused by someone; she initially believes

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.122
the woman is in her apartment, but it turns
out that the crying sound comes through the vent

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.550
The next day, she decides to invite her neighbor
for tea, so she walks out into the hallway

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.530
and leaves a post-it note on the door of the
apartment next door, asking the woman to join

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:01.849
her for tea.

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:06.290
That night, the woman named Lana knocks on
Ellen's door and comes in for tea.

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.660
She acts strange though, she knows Ellen used
to be a violinist and lost her sight.

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.970
She seems to know a lot about Ellen, even
though they just met.

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.470
Ellen touches her face, and to her surprise,
she feels a fresh scar on Lana's face.

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.610
Lanna reacts by warning her not to trust anyone.

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:23.750
And she runs out of the apartment.

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.970
Ellen becomes convinced that Lanna's husband
is being physically abusive to Lanna.

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.000
So Ellen reaches out to Detective Bryce, telling
him about the abuse her neighbor is getting

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.414
from her husband.

00:03:33.414 --> 00:03:37.170
Detective Bryce sends over Officer Nieman
to talk to her neighbor and make sure everything

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.170
is alright.

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.780
Later, he confirms she is okay, and the scar
was just a birthmark.

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.390
The next morning, she notices a strange thing
about the place.

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:51.050
She explains to Clayton that a car alarm goes
off every other day at precisely 11 am (the

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:53.659
time Clayton arrives at her place daily).

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:56.830
The same car, same alarm, same time.

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:00.739
Clayton dismisses the oddities, and tells
Ellen that it is a big city; it's got lots

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:02.010
of alarms.

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.550
Later that night, Ellen thinks Lana comes
into the apartment again.

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:10.810
However, when she touches her shoulder,
it turns out to be Lana's abusive husband.

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.500
He threatens her to leave his wife alone and
stop being paranoid.

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.269
Feeling threatened, Ellen immediately asks
Clayton to come to her place.

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:19.820
Clayton arrives and comforts her.

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:23.479
At that time, Clayton tells her that he has
feelings towards her.

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:27.910
However, Ellen rejects the interest by stating
that she needs a caretaker more than a boyfriend

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:29.050
at the moment.

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.210
Broken-hearted, Clayton leaves the apartment.

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:35.550
Soon after Clayton leaves, she is attacked
again by the person in the gas mask.

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:41.699
Ellen manages to dial 911 before she passes
out as the attacker pushes a syringe onto her neck

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:46.073
Later, the paramedic tells her that there's
no apparent injury and not a needle mark on her neck

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:51.210
When Detective Bryce comes in, he tells her
that the CCTV also shows no one enters the

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.139
apartment after Clayton.

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:58.229
After hearing that, Ellen feels distressed;
she can no longer believe her own perceptions.

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:01.890
Feeling isolated from everyone in her life
and believing someone is after her, Ellen

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:03.820
decides to end her own life.

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:08.230
And that is when we jump back to the beginning...and
watch as she writes a suicide note, and then

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:11.310
climbs up onto the balcony railing...and jumps
off.

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:18.040
However, instead of dying, Ellen falls 6 feet
and is just fine.

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.650
She quickly discovers that she's in a soundproofed
room.

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:22.220
A room without a door.

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:25.410
A room with speakers that play the sounds
of the city.

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:28.340
A fictional city, and a fictional high-rise.

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:32.479
She quickly realizes the apartment she was
staying in was fake, and all of the noises

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:34.990
"outside" were coming from a speaker system.

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:39.450
She hears the 11 am car alarm go off and climbs
back into the "apartment."

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:43.060
After climbing back into her "apartment,"
she explores the hallway only to find she

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:44.250
cannot escape.

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:47.270
So, she heads out and knocks on Lana's door.

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:51.050
And Lana tells her that this is home…that
there is no leaving.

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:53.259
Clayton then arrives to cook Ellen's dinner.

00:05:53.259 --> 00:05:57.540
When they sit down to eat dinner, Ellen hears
Clayton knock on the table twice.

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:01.750
Ellen recognizes this double-tap knock and
realizes that everybody else she's interacted

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:04.040
with since the attack has the same knocking.

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:08.419
That's when she realizes everyone she's met
since she woke up in the hospital - the nurse,

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:14.370
the doctor, the police detective, the paramedic,
Lana's husband - were all Clayton.

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:17.759
Realizing this truth, she pretends to drop
her drink, and hits him on the head with the

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:18.940
knife block.

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:23.130
She immediately takes his key and a taser,
and escapes down the hallway into the "apartment"

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:24.130
next door.

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:29.110
However, it is actually a weird empty storage
area... where Clayton keeps all his costumes

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:32.480
and everything else he needed to pull off
this ruse.

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:35.650
Clayton has been using various disguises to
play everyone.

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:40.030
Even more surprising, Ellen finds her assailant's
"outfit," which reveals that Clayton was the

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:43.970
one who attacked Ellen to make her blind,
and took her directly to this fake apartment

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:45.540
to keep her captive.

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:49.229
She then finds Lanna, who is actually real,
in a hidden room.

00:06:49.229 --> 00:06:53.419
This room is the fake hospital room she was
brought to at the beginning of the film.

00:06:53.419 --> 00:06:57.210
She reveals she is Clayton's sister, and she
helped him kidnap Ellen.

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:02.090
She then tells Ellen their only hope of escape
is by using the hidden vent in Clayton's room.

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:06.710
As Ellen is trying to escape, Clayton catches
up to her, knocks her out, and drags her into

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:07.910
his room.

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:11.680
It's the room that Lana had previously mentioned
contains the only way out through a vent in

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:12.920
the wall.

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:17.479
Ellen feels the air from the vent and realizes
that she has yet another chance to escape.

00:07:17.479 --> 00:07:20.410
Clayton launches into a monologue explaining
his actions.

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:25.130
When he was a kid, his father had locked him
and his sister, Lana, up in the basement,

00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:28.509
holding them captive for three years after
their mother had died.

00:07:28.509 --> 00:07:33.430
The only way Clayton had survived was by making
up characters in his head, giving them backstories,

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:35.020
and pretending to be them.

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:38.940
But what had truly saved him was the music
that Lana played for them in the attic.

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:43.080
The music he heard was Ellen's, who was a
child prodigy violin player.

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:45.560
He refers to her as his light in the dark.

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:48.380
So now, he wanted to be the same for her.

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:52.360
As he relays his story and motives, Ellen
grabs a chance to decapacitate him with the

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:57.080
taser and opens the vent; but discovers that
it's too small for her to crawl through.

00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:01.389
Taped inside the vent, Ellen finds a small
vial of the same substance that had blinded

00:08:01.389 --> 00:08:02.389
her.

00:08:02.389 --> 00:08:06.590
When Clayton comes around again, she sprays
the substance in his eyes, effectively blinding

00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:07.750
him too.

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:11.030
As Clayton writhes in pain, Lana arrives on
the scene.

00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:16.430
Upon seeing Clayton disabled, she frees Ellen,
sending her out into the real world.

00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:20.830
Six months later, Ellen prepares to go on
stage to the sound of an elated crowd.

00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:22.100
And that's how the movie ends.

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:24.290
Now, for the explanation.

00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:28.289
When watching this movie, we may notice that
Ellen is in every single scene from the very

00:08:28.289 --> 00:08:30.090
beginning to the very end.

00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:34.669
The reason for this...is that this entire
film is told from Ellen's perspective.

00:08:34.669 --> 00:08:38.099
Everything we see in this film is what Ellen
assumes is there; we see what ellen thinks

00:08:38.099 --> 00:08:39.550
she would be seeing.

00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:44.239
The only things we can trust as viewers.....is
what ellen hears ,and when ellen touches.

00:08:44.239 --> 00:08:48.110
This is best signified by the bird at the
beginning, which changes from green to blue

00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:51.100
as Clayton describes to Ellen that the bird
is blue.

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:54.610
If Ellen thinks the bird is blue, we see the
bird as blue.

00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:58.489
This is why when anyone shows up in front
of Ellen, we always see the person that Ellen

00:08:58.489 --> 00:09:00.230
assumes the person is.

00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:04.660
But once the person speaks or once Ellen touches
them, we realize who they actually are....because

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:08.740
Ellen is realizing who they actually are,
and this perspective is used throughout the

00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:10.360
entire film.

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:14.329
As we also see in the movie, Ellen has been
trying to contact her best friend, but she

00:09:14.329 --> 00:09:17.110
hasn't been picking up or returning her calls.

00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:21.069
This is because...Clayton has disconnected
her from the outside world.

00:09:21.069 --> 00:09:23.689
Ellen's friends and family had no idea she
was missing.

00:09:23.689 --> 00:09:27.699
No one had any clue where she was or what
she was going through.

00:09:27.699 --> 00:09:31.879
As the movie comes to a close, Clayton explains
to Ellen...he wants to be "the light in the

00:09:31.879 --> 00:09:33.339
darkness" for Ellen.

00:09:33.339 --> 00:09:38.070
Here, we can assume... he blinded Ellen in
hopes that she would be so helpless that she

00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:39.320
would need him.

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:43.819
In this way, his character resembles someone
with Munchausen by proxy, which is a mental

00:09:43.819 --> 00:09:48.019
health problem in which a caregiver makes
up or causes an illness or injury in a person

00:09:48.019 --> 00:09:49.529
under his care.

00:09:49.529 --> 00:09:52.680
Clayton also explained to Ellen, he would
also create various personalities…while

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:55.939
in the attic to have his own
imaginary friends.

00:09:55.939 --> 00:10:00.819
He uses the talent he learned in the attic of playing multiple
characters.....to fool Ellen into believing

00:10:00.819 --> 00:10:03.209
she is interacting with multiple characters.

00:10:03.469 --> 00:10:05.289
. He even imitates the voice of Ellen's brother.

00:10:07.039 --> 00:10:11.309
In the end, the movie cuts to six months later,
with Ellen back playing the violin on stage

However, it isn’t entirely clear if she
has her sight or not; it could be that Clayton

00:10:16.709 --> 00:10:20.779
wasn't lying when he was pretending to be
the doctor.....who told her it was "irreversible."

00:10:20.779 --> 00:10:25.110
However, since he was even lying about the
color of the bird in her apartment, we might

00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:29.509
not even be able to trust him about this ;and
it’s very possible she was only temporarily

00:10:29.509 --> 00:10:33.470
blind
That’s my explanation for the movie “Sightless”.
