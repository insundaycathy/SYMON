00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.600
Welcome back to Movie Recaps.&nbsp;
Today I will show you a horror,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.200
drama film from 2020, titled The Invisible Man.
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.480
Cecilia wakes up in the middle of the night.&nbsp;
She gets out of bed, trying not to wake her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.480
husband Adrian, then she reaches under&nbsp;
the bed for the drug she's hidden there.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.560
As she's leaving the bedroom, he moves a little&nbsp;
in his sleep and completely startles her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:27.280
Cecilia moves silently and deliberately to&nbsp;
the dressing room, where she gets a duffle&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:32.640
bag full of clothes and adds the medicine inside&nbsp;
as well. Next, she points the hallway camera to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.360
her sleeping husband and checks if it's working,&nbsp;
so that she can keep an eye on him. She walks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.120
into a room that looks like a laboratory&nbsp;
and disables the house cameras and alarm.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.880
Any noise she makes terrifies her and she checks&nbsp;
the camera if he's awake. She gets dressed quickly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.520
and quietly leaves the house through the garage.&nbsp;
Zeuss the dog follows her out and scares her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:56.960
at first. She takes his electric collar off,&nbsp;
when suddenly, the dog activates the car alarm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.680
and Cecilia runs toward the fence. The light&nbsp;
in the bedroom turn on, as she climbs over.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.400
She runs through the woods and gets to a road,&nbsp;
waiting for her sister Emily to pick her up.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.760
More than a moment passes and she looks&nbsp;
terrified. Finally, her sister arrives and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.560
Cecilia gets in the car. All of a sudden,&nbsp;
her husband appears behind her, screaming&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.280
after her and breaking the window. They drive&nbsp;
away, but he finds her diazepam on the ground.&nbsp;

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.520
Two weeks later, Cecilia is at a friend's&nbsp;
house, James. She's still afraid to go outside,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.440
but he convinces her to go out to the&nbsp;
mailbox. When she goes to open it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:37.120
a man jogging scares her and she runs back inside.&nbsp;
The next day, her friend is doing some home reno&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:42.480
and Cecilia is covering her computer camera, when&nbsp;
suddenly the doorbell rings. Emily is at the door.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.080
Cecilia is upset that she's there, thinking that&nbsp;
her husband might have followed her there. But,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:54.160
her sister has some news. She shows her an article&nbsp;
on her phone, saying her husband is dead. Cecilia&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:59.360
doesn't understand how. She tells james and Emily&nbsp;
about the way he would control her, from the way&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.480
she looked to the way she spoke and thought. His&nbsp;
abuse didn't just stop with physical violence.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:09.680
The next day, Cecilia is able to walk out of&nbsp;
the house more easily. She gets the letters by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:15.280
herself and is congratulated by her friend and his&nbsp;
daughter, Sydney for her efforts. James finds one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:21.600
of the letters is addressed to her. Later, Cecilia&nbsp;
and Emily are in a law office. Adrian's brother,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:27.360
who's also a lawyer, reads the final wishes of the&nbsp;
deceased, who has left Cecilia 5 million dollars,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.320
under the condition that she's never brought up&nbsp;
on criminal charges or declared mentally unstable.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:37.040
That night, she surprises Sydney and James with&nbsp;
a present, thanking them for taking good care of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.840
her. James gets a giant ladder and Sydney a bank&nbsp;
account with enough money to go to fashion school.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.000
They celebrate and then Cecilia&nbsp;
goes to her room. She keeps having&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.320
the feeling that someone is watching her.
The next morning, James leaves for work and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:55.920
asks Cecilia to wake Sydney up. She does just&nbsp;
that, while leaving the stove on. The breakfast&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:01.600
catches fire and the girl puts it out with a fire&nbsp;
extinguisher. Later that day, Cecilia is alone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.240
at the house, but she senses something strange&nbsp;
and goes to investigate. She looks through the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:10.240
entire house and finds nothing, when suddenly&nbsp;
she hears the front door of the house open.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:16.160
Cecilia checks the entrance. There is no one&nbsp;
there, but she still feels strange. Suddenly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:21.600
a second breath can be seen next to her. The same&nbsp;
night, Cecilia and Sydney are sleeping in Sydney's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.080
room. Suddenly something pulls their covers off&nbsp;
and starts playing with the light in the room,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.960
waking Cecilia. She thinks she sees someone&nbsp;
in the room briefly, but realizes it's just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:35.280
Sydney's manikin. Then she goes to pick up the&nbsp;
covers from the floor and thinks that there is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.600
someone sitting in the chair next to her, so&nbsp;
she throws the covers at it. There's no one.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.720
She pulls on the covers, but they don't move.&nbsp;
When she looks at them, it's as if someone is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:50.160
standing on them. Cecilia calls for James, waking&nbsp;
Sydney in the process and he rushes into the room.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.720
Since neither him nor his daughter see&nbsp;
anybody, he calms her down a little bit,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:00.480
saying not to let the memory of Adrian haunt her.
Cecilia has a job interview. The interviewer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.560
flirts with her as they sit down, but when he&nbsp;
sees that she's nervous asks to see her work.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:11.200
Cecilia opens the bag and her work isn't there.&nbsp;
She gets really upset and passes out cold. James&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.520
is sitting with her in the hospital as the doctor&nbsp;
tells her to basically keep it easy until her lab&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:20.960
results are done. Cecilia is taking a shower&nbsp;
and hears the phone ring. She picks up and it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:25.680
her doctor telling her that the reason for her&nbsp;
fainting is high levels of diazepam in her system.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:31.680
Cecilia sees a bottle of diazepam on the bathroom&nbsp;
sink. It has a bloody finger print on it. Later,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.920
Cecilia has taken James with her to see&nbsp;
Adrian's brother. She tells them about the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:41.360
bottle of diazepam, saying it was put there by&nbsp;
Adrian, but the brother dismisses her. Then she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.360
says that she doesn't believe he's dead, saying&nbsp;
that he's figured out a way to be invisible and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:50.720
that she's sure his brother knows about it. James&nbsp;
is shocked and Adrian's brother is unimpressed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:55.280
He says that his brother tortured him by getting&nbsp;
inside his head too. He shows her a picture of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.280
Adrian's dead body and tells her that he&nbsp;
was also relieved when his brother died.&nbsp;

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.760
Cecilia goes to see Emily and they have an awkward&nbsp;
conversation in which her sister tells her that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:08.640
she read her awful email about how she feels about&nbsp;
her. Cecilia tells her that she didn't send the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:14.400
email, but that Adrian did. Emily doesn't believe&nbsp;
her and tells her to get help. That night Cecilia&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:19.280
checks the sent items on her email and finds&nbsp;
the one sent to Emily. Sydney walks in to find&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:24.720
her crying on the floor. After a few comforting&nbsp;
words, they decide to go out. Sydney stands up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:30.000
and something hits her. She immediately calls&nbsp;
for her dad, thinking Cecilia did that to her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.920
As much as she tries she can't convince the two&nbsp;
of them that it wasn't her that hit the girl,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:38.480
so they leave her alone in the house. Cecilia&nbsp;
knows that Adrian is somehow there and starts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:43.440
calling for him. She grabs a bag of coffee and&nbsp;
spreads it all over the floor in one of the rooms,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:48.160
sitting herself down on the opposite end to the&nbsp;
door. Firmly believing that Adrian is there she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:53.200
talks to him, begging to be left alone. She gets&nbsp;
the idea to call his phone and when it rings,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:58.160
she can hear it in the celling. Celia climbs in&nbsp;
the celling and starts looking for him, but sees&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:03.200
no one. She calls the phone again and goes in&nbsp;
it's direction, where she finds Adrian's keys,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:08.160
a knife and her design work. There's a noise&nbsp;
behind her, so she grabs a paint and throws it at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:13.200
the opening of the celling, suddenly showing the&nbsp;
contours of a man. She gets down from the celling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:18.160
and looks for him, when she hears the water&nbsp;
running in the kitchen. The sink is full of paint.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:23.200
An invisible hand grabs and lifts her abruptly.&nbsp;
It throws her around the house, they fight,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:27.520
it chases after her and tries to strangle her,&nbsp;
but she fights it off and runs out of the house.&nbsp;

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:32.640
Cecilia manages to get an Uber and asks him to&nbsp;
take her to the house where she lived with Adrian.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:38.960
They get to the house and she asks the Uber to&nbsp;
wait. Cecilia walks inside and is joined by Zeuss.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:43.200
The dog follows her to the basement laboratory,&nbsp;
where she heads straight to one of the gadgets.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:47.760
She tries to figure out what it is by looking&nbsp;
at a tablet strapped to the wall and succeeds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:53.120
in deactivating the gadget, slowly revealing an&nbsp;
invisibility suit. Cecilia is taking the suit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:56.960
of the manikin, when the dog barks and runs&nbsp;
toward something, alerting her that there's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:01.200
someone else in the house. Cecilia goes to&nbsp;
hide in the dressing room in the bedroom,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:06.640
but is followed by the invisible man. He opens the&nbsp;
door, but ironically doesn't see her immediately.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:10.400
She runs away as the dog barks&nbsp;
at him. While in the Uber,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:15.040
she calls Emily asking to meet her that night.
Cecilia waits for her sister in a restaurant,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:20.000
nervously looking at the empty chair. When Emily&nbsp;
arrives, she tells her about what she found in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.120
Adrian's house, that would prove that he's still&nbsp;
alive. Suddenly a knife is floating mid air,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:30.000
killing Emily. In the next moment it's in&nbsp;
Cecilia's hand. A patron in the restaurant&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.920
screams and everyone freaks out, moving away from&nbsp;
her. Cecilia is pinned down and arrested. She's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:40.960
taken to an asylum, screaming that she didn't&nbsp;
do it. Staring at the empty corners of the room,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:43.840
she says that Adrian killed her&nbsp;
sister and that she knows he's there.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:49.200
She's sedated and left alone. Footsteps are heard&nbsp;
heading toward her and the words "surprise".&nbsp;

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.120
James and another detective are interrogating&nbsp;
Cecilia. She says she has proof about Adrian,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:59.040
but that she can't tell them what it is because&nbsp;
he's in the room and they can't see him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:03.920
The other detective leaves and she asks James&nbsp;
if he believes her. She says she feels guilty,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:09.360
but James feels guilty in his own way too. Later,&nbsp;
Cecilia is talking to a doctor who tells her that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:14.240
she's pregnant and that it happened sometime in&nbsp;
the last month. The next day, Adrian's brother&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:18.160
comes to see her in the asylum. He's there&nbsp;
to tell her that since she's been brought&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:22.400
up on criminal charges and potentially ruled&nbsp;
mentally incompetent, she's lost the right to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:28.000
Adrian's money. She belittles him, comparing him&nbsp;
to his narcissist sociopath brother. He tells her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.800
that she has two options, to sign the document and&nbsp;
forfeit the money, or to have the baby and go back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:38.560
to Adrian. He offers her a new life with Adrian&nbsp;
in one phone call. She refuses and steals one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:43.280
of his pens when he isn't looking. He tells her&nbsp;
he'll come back in 3 days for her final decision.&nbsp;

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:48.480
Later that night, after the orderly checks&nbsp;
Cecilia's room thoroughly and leaves, she goes in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:53.200
the shower. She takes the pen and as she starts to&nbsp;
cut into her veins says "you won't get the baby".&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:58.800
Suddenly the invisible man grabs her hand and&nbsp;
she stabs him with the pen, repeatedly. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:04.000
security guard walks in, but sees the damaged&nbsp;
suit. He goes to shock the invisible man,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:09.840
but the he turns the stun gun back on the guard.&nbsp;
Cecilia runs but is quickly stopped by two guards.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:13.200
They're taking her back to her room and&nbsp;
the man appears again, killing them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:18.560
More keep coming and suffer the same fate, one&nbsp;
by one, completely unaware of what's happening&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:23.840
to them. After killing the last guard on that&nbsp;
floor, the man drops the gun. Cecilia runs after&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:29.280
him and takes it. She chases him to the stairwell&nbsp;
and shoots after him. They both leave the facility&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:34.960
and go outside in the pouring rain. Cecilia is&nbsp;
looking for him, with the gun on hand. She hears&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:40.160
a noise and goes after it, while security guards&nbsp;
are after her too. Close to her is an open trunk,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:45.360
so she approaches it, assuming he's hiding there.&nbsp;
He grabs her suddenly and starts strangling her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:49.920
telling her that if she doesn't comply he'll&nbsp;
hurt the ones she loves, like Sydney. Cecilia&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:54.880
goes after him again, but when she gets outside&nbsp;
of the fence, the invisible man speeds toward her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:59.920
with his car while she shoots at him, causing&nbsp;
another car to crash. Cecilia steals that car&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:05.040
and goes after him again, relentlessly. While&nbsp;
driving she calls James and tells him to go back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:09.920
to the house and protect Sydney. The invisible&nbsp;
man arrives at the house and goes into her room.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:15.680
She wakes up and gets the pepper spray out of her&nbsp;
bag. Since she can hear him moving, she sprays him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:21.120
and he falls over. She runs away screaming, but&nbsp;
the man grabs her. At that moment James arrives&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:25.840
at the house so the man just starts attacking him&nbsp;
instead. Sydney begs him to stop beating up her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:31.840
dad, when suddenly, Cecilia arrives and blasts him&nbsp;
with a fire extinguisher, then shoots him dead.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:36.320
She goes over to the body and takes off the mask&nbsp;
, only to reveal that it was Adrian's brother.&nbsp;

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:41.200
A tactical police unit is seen going through&nbsp;
Adrian's house as cries for help are heard&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:46.640
from inside. The police tear down a wall in&nbsp;
the basement and find Adrian tied up. Later,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:50.960
James tells Cecilia how he was found, but she&nbsp;
doesn't believe that he was his brother's victim.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:55.360
James tries to convince her, but she&nbsp;
believes that Adrian set his brother up,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:55.360 --> 00:11:00.240
making her feel like she's the crazy one.
That night, she goes back to the house. He's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:05.280
waiting for her, pleased to see her. She's not&nbsp;
as pleased to see him though. They sit down for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:10.000
dinner and he's trying to be vulnerable with her,&nbsp;
apologizes to her, saying his learned his lesson.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:14.480
She wants him to admit to everything that he&nbsp;
did, but he keeps swearing that his brother was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:19.600
controlling him. Cecilia persists in asking for&nbsp;
his admission and meanwhile James is outside the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:25.040
house, listening to every word the two are saying.&nbsp;
As she's crying, Adrian comes over to comfort her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:29.920
but falls back to his controlling ways again.&nbsp;
Cecilia goes to the bathroom to clean herself&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:33.920
up and he's seen waiting for her at the&nbsp;
table. After she's been gone for a while,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:39.520
he becomes restless and suddenly kills himself.&nbsp;
After a moment, Cecilia comes back and immediately&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:44.400
calls the emergency services. She pulls away&nbsp;
in the blind spot of the security camera,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:48.720
sits down and watches him die. James comes&nbsp;
running toward the house after he heard&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:53.600
what's happened and finds Cecilia leaving.&nbsp;
She tells him that Adrian had killed himself,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:57.760
but James sees the suit in a duffle bag she's&nbsp;
holding and asks if she planned it all along.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:03.520
Cecilia doesn't answer the question directly. She&nbsp;
walks out of the house, leaving everything behind.
