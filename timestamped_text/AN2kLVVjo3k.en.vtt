00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:06.640
Hi, Mystery Recapped here. Today I’m going&nbsp;
to explain an American science fiction&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:15.920
action film called “Elysium,” Spoilers&nbsp;
ahead! Watch out and take care! 
&nbsp;

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:22.720
The premise of the movie is set in the year&nbsp;
2154, when the earth is overpopulated and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:29.200
polluted beyond rehabilitation. Many new diseases&nbsp;
have evolved, making half of the population sick.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:34.480
What once used to be beautiful cities have&nbsp;
turned into slums. Society has divided into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:40.080
the higher and lower classes, and the financial&nbsp;
gap between the two is exponential. The wealthy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:45.120
and powerful people have created their own&nbsp;
new place to live, far away from the poor.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.480
They live in a space station that lies on the&nbsp;
earth’s orbit called the Elysium. Elysium is a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:56.960
utopian city with no sadness or sickness. It has&nbsp;
all kinds of luxurious resources, and among them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.240
the most important is the facility of “medbay”.&nbsp;
Medbays are privately owned medical chambers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:07.760
that can instantly heal any disease known to&nbsp;
humanity or any form of physical injury. 
&nbsp;

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.800
While life on Elysium is magical, life on&nbsp;
the earth is the exact opposite. People&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:18.400
are governed by mindless robots police who beat&nbsp;
them in the name of the zero-tolerance policy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.680
At the beginning of the movie, a little boy&nbsp;
named Max Da Costa and his friend Frey Santiago&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.880
read the stories about Elysium and its lavish&nbsp;
life. Max promises Frey that he will take her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:34.000
to the Elysium one day. The little boy lives in&nbsp;
an orphanage that is run by a nun whom he loves&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.440
a lot. His ambition in life is to visit the&nbsp;
Elysium one day. However, many years later,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.960
Max has grown up to be a criminal. He and Frey&nbsp;
have lost contact while his mother-like nun&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.000
is no more. Max is trying to recover from&nbsp;
his criminal past and is doing a normal job&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.840
at Armadyne corporation, a factory where weaponry&nbsp;
for Elysium and robots police are manufactured.
&nbsp;

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.960
One day while going to work, some robot&nbsp;
police approach Max and break his wrist&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.840
for being disobedient. He goes to the hospital&nbsp;
and is surprised to see his old friend Frey,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:11.600
who has grown up to be a nurse. The two catch up&nbsp;
while Frey treats Max’s injuries. Max tries to ask&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:21.040
her out, but she leaves to tend to another patient&nbsp;
before he can. We see that the hospital is packed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.680
with people, which is considered normal because&nbsp;
of the overpopulation and diseases. Max then goes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.880
to his work, where half of his pay is deducted for&nbsp;
being late. The CEO of the Armadyne corporation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:36.240
is a resident of Elysium named John Carlyle. He&nbsp;
stays on earth to look after the factories and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:41.600
only cares for the company’s profit. He has no&nbsp;
sympathy for his worker’s problems at all. 
&nbsp;

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.720
A criminal named Spider has formulated an&nbsp;
illegal emigration operating system for the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:52.320
people on the earth to enter Elysium. But the&nbsp;
process is very risky as only some who depart&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.800
make it to the Elysium without harm. First,&nbsp;
they acquire the Elysium identification&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.920
brands on their wrist, which allows them to&nbsp;
access any facility on Elysium. After that,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.240
the people board three rustic-looking&nbsp;
spaceships and head for the space station.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:11.600
As the ships get closer, the Defence Secretary&nbsp;
of Elysium Jessica Delacourt is alerted about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:17.520
the breach. She contacts C.M. Kruger, a rogue&nbsp;
sleeper agent and her right-hand man on Earth. 
&nbsp;

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:22.800
Kruger immediately obeys Jessica’s orders and&nbsp;
fires an air missile launcher to the ships.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.680
Two of them get shot but the missile misses the&nbsp;
third ship. In the two ships that are destroyed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:33.440
forty six people are killed. Fortunately, the&nbsp;
last ship lands on Elysium. However, before the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.640
people aboard the ship can run away, Jessica&nbsp;
orders the guards to apprehend everyone in it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.200
The police choppers and robots chase the&nbsp;
Earthers and arrest them. The only two&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:48.080
people able to make it to a medbay are a mother&nbsp;
and her sick daughter. The daughter is healed in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.840
the medbay because of her identification&nbsp;
band. When she gets out of the machine,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:57.280
the mother is delighted to see that she can walk&nbsp;
properly. Right then, the robot police attest the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.600
two. The Earthers who resist are killed while&nbsp;
the others are deported back to the earth. 
&nbsp;

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:07.840
Back on earth, Max is at his work when a door at&nbsp;
his workstation jams. His supervisor asks him to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:13.520
go inside to fix it, even though it is extremely&nbsp;
dangerous. Max obliges but as he goes inside,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:23.520
the door shuts close and he is blasted with a wave&nbsp;
of lethal radiation. A while later, he is dragged&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.480
from the chamber and sent to a medical unit. He&nbsp;
is then told by another robot that he will soon&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:35.840
experience catastrophic organ failure and has&nbsp;
only five days to live. CEO John comes sees Max&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:41.200
lying on a bed but cares more about the bedding&nbsp;
being ruined than Max’s health. A robot gives&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:46.080
Max some pills to help him with the pain and will&nbsp;
keep him physically functional until he dies. 
&nbsp;

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:52.080
Right after the last mission, Jessica is summoned&nbsp;
by Patel, the President of Elysium. He isn’t fond&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.880
of Jessica’s methods and doesn’t support the&nbsp;
irresponsible killing of people. But Jessica&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:01.520
claps back by saying that she won’t allow&nbsp;
the homes of their future children, Elysium,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:07.200
to be raided by the Earthers. Patel, however,&nbsp;
threatens Jessica to fire her if she causes more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:12.480
casualties and orders her to stop using Kruger&nbsp;
immediately. Back on the earth, Kruger is told&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:17.840
to return all his weapons because his service&nbsp;
isn’t needed anymore. He is enraged and feels&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:23.600
betrayed by Jessica. Meanwhile, Max's criminal&nbsp;
friend Julio sees him limping back from work&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:28.960
and goes to help him. After Julio helps him to&nbsp;
take his medicines, Max asks him to find Spider.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:34.480
He is now desperate to go to Elysium as soon as&nbsp;
possible and use the medbay to heal himself. 
&nbsp;

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:39.760
Max and Julio go to meet Spider and ask him to&nbsp;
send Max to Elysium in turn for a favor Max did&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:44.640
to him three years ago. Spider, on the other&nbsp;
hand, offers him a task to plug into the brain&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:50.320
of one of Elysium's high-ranking officials and&nbsp;
obtain passcodes and other secret data. Spider&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:55.680
wants to use the information to acquire money from&nbsp;
the official’s bank account. If Max can do that,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:00.880
Spider will make sure Max gets to Elysium and&nbsp;
gets his treatment. Max has no other way to save&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:05.920
his life, so he accepts the offer. It turns out&nbsp;
the high-ranking official that Max has to get the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:12.000
information from is John, the man who cared about&nbsp;
bedsheets more than Max’s life. However, Spider&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:18.000
knows that Max cannot fulfill his mission in his&nbsp;
physical condition. So, he performs a procedure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.200
on him to attach a third-generation powered&nbsp;
exoskeleton to his body and connect a neural&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:33.840
chip to his brain. The exoskeleton gives Max&nbsp;
the strength that is equal to a police robot.
&nbsp;

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:39.280
In the following scene, we see CEO John meet&nbsp;
Jessica who is fed up with the president’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:44.480
ideologies. She wants John to reboot&nbsp;
and override Elysium's computer core&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:50.080
and reinstate her as the new president. John&nbsp;
agrees to do the job and goes back to the earth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:55.680
to reboot the computer program as per her demand.&nbsp;
He also programs a denial system that would kill&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:00.000
anyone attempting to download data from his&nbsp;
brain. He then boards a shuttle for a flight&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.800
to Elysium but the shuttle is shot by Max and&nbsp;
his team before it can leave earth. They find&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:09.920
the CEO and are about to extract the required&nbsp;
information from him but a droid confronts them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:15.280
and a shootout ensues; John is shot in the&nbsp;
process. They manage to defeat the droid and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:20.560
get the required information from John’s brain.
Jessica is altered about John’s situation and she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:25.360
immediately sends Kruger to get the people who&nbsp;
attacked John. Kruger and his men arrive at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:32.000
location and start firing at Max and his team. All&nbsp;
of his teammates, including his best friend Julio,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.840
are killed but Max manages to flee from the scene.&nbsp;
Jessica is now stressed knowing that someone has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:43.360
access to her top-secret mission to overthrow the&nbsp;
president. She jams all the signals in the area&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:48.480
so no other spaceships can leave. Meanwhile,&nbsp;
Kruger also gets his hands on the data that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:53.200
was extracted from John’s brain. He realizes&nbsp;
the data is actually Jessica’s secret program&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:57.920
and encourages his men to retrieve more&nbsp;
of it, presumably for his own benefit. 
&nbsp;

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:03.600
In the meantime, a heavily injured Max goes to ask&nbsp;
for help from Frey. She brings him to her house&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:08.320
and dresses his wounds. He wakes up the following&nbsp;
day to see a little girl in front of him. It turns&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:14.000
out that she is Frey’s daughter who is ill from&nbsp;
leukemia and has very little time to live. Frey&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.440
asks Max to take her to Elysium but Max claims&nbsp;
that he is being pursued by very dangerous people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:24.640
and if they are associated with him, they will&nbsp;
be killed too. After he leaves, Kruger and his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:30.000
men arrive looking for Max. They take Frey and her&nbsp;
little daughter hostage when they find out Max was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.800
treated there the previous night. After a while,&nbsp;
Max goes to Spider with the code he retrieved from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:40.000
John’s brain but is disappointed to find that&nbsp;
all air spaces have been jammed by Jessica.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.280
This means that Spider cannot keep his end of&nbsp;
the offer and Max cannot be sent to Elysium. 
&nbsp;

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:50.480
Spider goes through the code in Max’s brain and is&nbsp;
beyond surprised to see that it is code to reset&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:56.080
and reboot the whole Elysium. If they can&nbsp;
manage to rewrite the codes and make everyone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:56.080 --> 00:09:00.880
the citizen of Elysium, all humans could enjoy&nbsp;
the medbay facility, leaving no more diseases&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:06.000
in the world. Spider tries to convince Max to&nbsp;
wait until they can override Elysium’s system&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.280
which might take five days. But with hours to&nbsp;
live, Max wants to sell the data to Jessica in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:15.840
turn for a chance to use the medbay and&nbsp;
save his life. Max realizes that Kruger&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:21.600
needs him alive so when he comes to get him, Max&nbsp;
simply turns himself in. Inside Kruger’s ship,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:26.720
he is surprised to see Frey and her daughter&nbsp;
abducted. Kruger tells Jessica about them finding&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:31.840
the code and Jessica lifts the air space jam,&nbsp;
allowing Kruger’s ship with Frey, her daughter,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:38.560
and Max to come to Elysium. This also gives Spider&nbsp;
and his men a chance to pursue Max. They get into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:43.920
a spaceship with the intention of finding Max and&nbsp;
using the code for the benefit of humanity.
&nbsp;

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:49.520
Back in Kruger’s ship, he misbehaves with Frey&nbsp;
which angers Max. As Max retaliates, their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:55.280
little argument turns big and a shootout occurs&nbsp;
inside the ship. Max throws a grenade at Kruger,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:55.280 --> 00:10:00.000
blowing half of his face off. The ship’s&nbsp;
control system is damaged and it crashes onto&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.960
a lavish house in Elysium. Jessica orders for&nbsp;
everyone aboard the ship to be brought to her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:09.040
Frey brings her daughter out of the destroyed&nbsp;
ship and goes inside the nearest house looking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:13.840
for a medbay. She finds one and tries to use it&nbsp;
on her daughter but it doesn’t work since she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:18.320
doesn't have citizenship. The guards eventually&nbsp;
catch all of them and take them to Jessica.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:24.320
Kruger’s men put Kruger in a medbay and fix his&nbsp;
face. Meanwhile, Jessica puts Max on a machine to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:29.120
extract all the information from his head but&nbsp;
the extraction is sure to kill him. She asks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:33.760
her men to go ahead with it because Max’s life&nbsp;
is worth nothing to her. After Jessica leaves,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:38.640
Kruger’s men take Frey and her daughter back. 
The doctors are about to extract the information&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:44.560
from Max’s brain and kill him, but, he manages to&nbsp;
free himself in time. At the same time, Jessica&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:49.200
belittles Kruger for crashing his spaceship&nbsp;
and threatening the life of Elysium’s citizens.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:54.880
As she insults him, an enraged Kruger stabs her&nbsp;
in the neck. He plans to rewrite the code and make&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:54.880 --> 00:11:00.160
himself the president of Elysium. Kruger’s men set&nbsp;
off to kill all the politicians in the facility&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:04.320
while he goes to rewrite the code.
Meanwhile, Spider and his men also land on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:09.520
Elysium looking for Max. They are in the facility&nbsp;
tracking his location. Max, on the other hand,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:13.680
is looking for Frey when he sees that&nbsp;
Spider is in the facility through a screen.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:18.480
He contacts him and tells him to go forward with&nbsp;
the plan of making everyone Elysium’s citizen,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:24.080
and thus eradicating all diseases from the earth.&nbsp;
Max then rescues Frey and meets Spider at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:29.440
same time. He sends Frey to the nearest medbay&nbsp;
and asks her to wait until they recode everyone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:34.880
as Elysium’s citizen so her daughter can be&nbsp;
healed. After that, Max, along with Spider make&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:39.680
their way to recode the system but are caught&nbsp;
by Kruger on the way. Max and Kruger get into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:45.120
an intense fight but Max is easily overpowered.&nbsp;
However, the course of the fight changes when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:50.320
Max manages to take off Kruger’s neural chip&nbsp;
and thus dismantling his whole system.
&nbsp;

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:54.880
After defeating him, Max and Spider get to the&nbsp;
mainframe and get ready to extract the code from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:54.880 --> 00:12:00.240
Max’s brain. However, since CEO John had coded&nbsp;
that anyone who extracts the code would be killed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:05.520
the only way to save everyone else in the&nbsp;
world is for Max to die. In his limited time,&nbsp;&nbsp;
