00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.680
Story Recapped here. Today,&nbsp;
I'm going to explain a fantasy,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:08.320
thriller, mystery film called "Let Me In."&nbsp;
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.&nbsp;

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:14.000
In 1983 at Los Alamos, New Mexico, police cars&nbsp;
escort an ambulance to a Memorial Hospital with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.800
sirens blaring. They're carrying an unidentified&nbsp;
50-year-old man with acid burns on his face.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.920
The attendants place him on a respirator&nbsp;
since the acid's toxic fumes seared his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.120
lungs and compromised his breathing.&nbsp;
A Detective then approaches him at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:29.680
hospital. Since the man cannot speak, he hands&nbsp;
him a pen and a notepad to write his answers.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.480
The detective then asks him to identify himself,&nbsp;
wondering if the old man is a Satanic cult member.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.720
He receives no response. A nurse directs the&nbsp;
detective to the front desk to take a call from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.320
the lobby receptionist, who informs him that the&nbsp;
man's daughter has inquired about her father.&nbsp;

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.320
The man’s respirator starts beeping&nbsp;
and a nurse returns to the man's room.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.680
A loud scream reverberates through the hospital&nbsp;
when the nurse witnesses the man jump from the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.600
tenth-floor window to his death. The detective&nbsp;
immediately rushes to the room to see what is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.840
going on. He looks through the window and&nbsp;
sees the man’s body. Feeling hopeless,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.080
the detective heads back to grab his notepad and&nbsp;
sees a note written that says, "I'm sorry, Abby."

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.040
Two weeks earlier, twelve-year-old Owen is&nbsp;
sitting alone while singing to himself in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.720
their apartment's snow-covered courtyard until&nbsp;
his mother called him for dinner. He then puts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.640
his hands inside his pockets, gets tons of candy&nbsp;
wrappers, and throws them, burying them into the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.440
snow. While having dinner with his mother, the&nbsp;
phone suddenly rings. It turns out Owen's parents&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.680
are going through a divorce, so he frequently&nbsp;
entertains himself by playing alone in his room.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.600
Owen points a knife in front of the mirror while&nbsp;
wearing a mask as if he's threatening someone.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.640
He then grabs his telescope to peek&nbsp;
through their neighbors, and then suddenly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.080
he notices a girl his age and her father&nbsp;
moving into the apartment next door.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.160
She's not wearing any shoes, which is unusual.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.680
The following day at school, a bully named Kenny&nbsp;
throws a snowball at Owen while they're having a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.760
ceremony inside the classroom. Owen simply wipes&nbsp;
it off while Kenny gives him a stern look.&nbsp;

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.960
Meanwhile, during a swimming class, Kenny keeps&nbsp;
on tripping Owen and his other classmates as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.880
He naughtily unties a swimsuit of his&nbsp;
classmates, causing their teacher to punish him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.200
Kenny seems upset and sees Owen smirking at&nbsp;
him. Owen immediately rushes into his locker,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.960
but Kenny and his friends interrupt him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.520
teasing him that he's a little girl. As Owen tries&nbsp;
to escape, the bully puts him down on the floor,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.280
punching and kicking him, and even gives Owen&nbsp;
a wedgie, causing him to urinate on himself.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.120
Owen doesn't fight back out of fear, and the&nbsp;
bullies leave him miserable on the floor.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.680
On his way home, he stops by&nbsp;
a convenience store to grab&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.880
some of his favorite "Now and Later"&nbsp;
candies. While paying for his sweets,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.840
he notices a swiss knife at the counter,&nbsp;
wondering if he would buy it as well.&nbsp;

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.040
That evening, he notices that the new girl,&nbsp;
Abby, is watching him as he rehearses knife&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.560
attacks on a tree in the courtyard. She's not&nbsp;
friendly and tells him right away that they're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.280
not going to be friends. Abby leaves while Owen&nbsp;
is alone again, practicing his knife skills.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.400
Owen later sees Abby's father walk&nbsp;
through the yard, carrying a duffel.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.120
Later that evening, Abby's father meticulously&nbsp;
stalks a high school kid at a local supermarket&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.200
and breaks into the kid's car. Unbeknownst to&nbsp;
the presence of a man in his back seat, the kid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.520
casually drives his vehicle until he stops by a&nbsp;
railroad as he waits for the train to pass by.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.280
Abby's father knocks him out as the train&nbsp;
passes. He then drags him into the woods,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.440
ties him up by his ankles, and slices his&nbsp;
throat open, draining his blood into a jug.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.600
When he's about to leave, Abby's father then trips&nbsp;
in the snow and spills the blood on the ground.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.680
He immediately packs his&nbsp;
things as a truck approaches.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.120
When Abby's father returns home, Abby seems upset.&nbsp;
Through the walls, Owen hears the father saying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.760
that he's getting old, weak, and slow, and maybe&nbsp;
even wanted to get caught. Abby then walks out.&nbsp;

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.520
The following day, Owen's school announces&nbsp;
the death of one of their students,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:24.240
advising everyone to keep safe. That night, Abby&nbsp;
and Owen cross paths again in the courtyard.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:29.280
He notices Abby isn't wearing shoes again, and she&nbsp;
stinks. Despite this, Owen shares his Rubik's cube&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.440
with her and demonstrates how to use it. Owen&nbsp;
feels weird around her, so he returns home,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.320
leaving Abby alone with the Rubik's cube. As her&nbsp;
stomach growls, she drops the cube and leaves.&nbsp;

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.560
Later that night, Abby hides, sitting in the&nbsp;
shadows beneath a bridge. A young man hears&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.720
Abby's pleading on his way to get his motorcycle&nbsp;
parked under the bridge. Abby pretends to be sick&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.640
and asks a passing man to assist her. The man&nbsp;
then picks her up and promises to take her home&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.720
when suddenly she grabs him and bites his neck.&nbsp;
The man tries to resist her attacks, but she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.760
is too strong. Once satisfied with drinking his&nbsp;
blood, she breaks the man's neck and runs away.&nbsp;

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.000
When Abby returns home, she tells her father what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.680
she's done, making him furious. Owen&nbsp;
overhears their argument once again.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:10.000
Still, the father cleans up Abby's mess by&nbsp;
dumping the man's body into a small lake.&nbsp;

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.560
One night, Abby is waiting for Owen in&nbsp;
the yard. She's friendlier this time,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.880
and she takes the time to explain how she solved&nbsp;
the puzzle to Owen. Abby also smells better,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.960
but it's strange that when Owen asks for her&nbsp;
birth date, the girl can't recall it. Abby doesn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.960
celebrate her birthdays or receive gifts because&nbsp;
she doesn't know her birthday, so Owen offers her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.960
the Rubik's cube as a present. They seem to be&nbsp;
closer as they smile candidly at each other.&nbsp;

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.600
The next day, while the rest of the class blushes&nbsp;
while watching Romeo and Juliet, Owen is pretty&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.680
busy studying Morse code symbols. Kenny and his&nbsp;
friends confront him in the restroom later and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.080
inquire about what he was working on in class.&nbsp;
When Owen refuses to show him, Kenny hits him with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.800
a metal wire, causing a gash on his left cheek.&nbsp;
At dinner, Owen later informs his distant and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.960
inattentive mother that he fell during recess. His&nbsp;
mother tells him to be more careful next time.&nbsp;

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:58.160
After dinner, Owen meets Abby in the yard, as&nbsp;
is customary. Owen tells her the truth about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.840
what happened when she notices the band-aid on&nbsp;
his cheek. She warns him that if he hits them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:07.040
hard enough, they will stop. Abby even promises to&nbsp;
assist him if they continue hurting him. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.640
Owen tells her about the Morse code he learned&nbsp;
so that they can communicate through walls.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:13.760
Abby wonders if Owen hears them, to&nbsp;
which he responds only sometimes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:17.200
prompting him to ask more questions about&nbsp;
her. When she returns to their unit,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.040
she commands her father to&nbsp;
move away from the wall,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:22.400
so she and Owen can practice tapping Morse code&nbsp;
on the wall that divides their apartments.&nbsp;

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.240
The following day, Owen enrolls in&nbsp;
the weight-lifting program at school,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.440
hoping he can beat his bullies.&nbsp;

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.760
Later that day, Owen sneaks through her mom's&nbsp;
room to steal twenty dollars while gazing at a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:37.280
sacred photo. He later takes Abby to an arcade. He&nbsp;
hands her his favorite candy bars. She initially&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:41.920
refuses but then tries one. Upon eating the&nbsp;
candy, she heads out as she tries to vomit it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:46.640
Owen follows her, and Abby apologizes. Feeling&nbsp;
bad, Owen then hugs her to comfort her. While&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:50.880
hugging, Abby inquires if he would still like her&nbsp;
if she weren't a girl, to which Owen responds, "I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:55.360
guess so," not entirely realizing what Abby means.&nbsp;
They walk home, and while nearing the apartment,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:00.080
Abby holds his hand, but suddenly Owen's mother&nbsp;
calls his name, asking him to go home. Feeling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:04.080
disappointed, he talks her out for a second,&nbsp;
but she's gone when he comes back for Abby.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.440
However, they meet in the corridor, smiling&nbsp;
at each other while saying good night.&nbsp;

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:11.520
While preparing his duffel bag, father&nbsp;
greets Abby as she walks in the door.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:15.520
Abby slowly approaches him and caresses his&nbsp;
face. The father holds her hand and tells her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:19.840
not to meet Owen again as he becomes envious&nbsp;
as Owen and Abby's friendship grows stronger.&nbsp;

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:23.120
During the night, Abby's father makes&nbsp;
another attempt to get blood for Abby.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.960
He finds another target and hides in the&nbsp;
back seat of their car once again. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:31.440
the target's friend named Greg ruins Abby's&nbsp;
father's plans as Greg suddenly asks for a ride.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:36.000
The target pulls over for gas, leaving Greg alone&nbsp;
inside the car. When the kid gets reaches for his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.560
bag in the backseat, Abby's father assaults him.&nbsp;
The struggling kid causes them to crash into a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:45.040
barrier and flip over, trapping Father beneath the&nbsp;
vehicle and killing Greg instantly. Abby's father&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:49.520
knows that the police find him soon, so he pours&nbsp;
acid on his face so he couldn’t be identified.&nbsp;

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:53.360
While Abby is on her bed, comforted by the fact&nbsp;
that Owen is on the other side of the wall, she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:56.960
suddenly learns through a radio report that her&nbsp;
father is in the hospital and under investigation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.800
She goes to the hospital and heads to&nbsp;
its front desk to ask for her father.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:05.280
However, the front desk officer tells her to&nbsp;
wait as she calls for assistance. Abby refuses&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:09.840
and heads out of the hospital. The front desk&nbsp;
officer follows her out, but she's suddenly gone.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:13.840
It turns out she’s climbed up the building until&nbsp;
she reaches her father's window. The burnt-face&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:18.080
father welcomes her in and extends his neck to&nbsp;
her. After she drains his blood, Father falls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:22.480
to his death, while Abby hides from the dark. The&nbsp;
detective, taking a call from the receptionist in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:26.880
the lobby, hears the nurse scream and arrives in&nbsp;
the father's room. As soon as the detective leaves&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:30.640
the window after peeking through what happened,&nbsp;
Abby jumps off the building, escaping the scene.&nbsp;

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:34.880
Abby then returns to the apartment building a&nbsp;
little while later and knocks on Owen's window,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:40.480
requesting entry. Owen is almost asleep when she&nbsp;
enters the room. Still, he tells her to come in.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:43.920
Abby crawls into bed with him after&nbsp;
removing her bloody clothes. When Owen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:47.040
asks if she wants to be his girlfriend,&nbsp;
Abby responds that she's not a girl,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:50.560
but that doesn't seem to bother Owen,&nbsp;
so they decide to be in a relationship.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:54.640
Abby returns to her unit the following day, but&nbsp;
she leaves Owen a note saying she has to go away.

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:59.040
One afternoon, during a school outing to a&nbsp;
local pond for ice skating, Kenny and his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:02.800
friends confront Owen again, threatening&nbsp;
to push him into an ice hole. This time,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:06.560
Owen stands up for himself and summons the courage&nbsp;
to strike Kenny with a big stick in the head,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:11.520
causing Kenny's ear to bleed. At the same time,&nbsp;
other students notice a body frozen in the ice.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:13.520
The cops arrive and take&nbsp;
the body out of the lake.&nbsp;

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:16.880
Later that night, the detective&nbsp;
knocks on their unit at home,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:20.160
asking a few questions about the killing&nbsp;
incident that happened in their neighborhood.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:23.280
The detective knocks on Abby’s&nbsp;
apartment, but she refuses to open it.

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:29.360
The next day, Owen happens to see Jimmy, Kenny's&nbsp;
older brother, tripping him about his ears. Owen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:33.280
is delighted to see Kenny experiencing what he&nbsp;
had gone through. When he goes home, he tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:37.280
Abby about fighting back against his bullies,&nbsp;
doing what Abby advised her. They seem happy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:42.400
and satisfied. Feeling proud of him, Abby kisses&nbsp;
his cheek. Owen then takes Abby to a secret room&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:46.080
in the basement of the apartment building that&nbsp;
night. When Abby asks why they're in the basement,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:50.400
Owen asks her to close her eyes. He then pulls&nbsp;
out a knife and cuts his palm, offering a pact&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:54.480
by mixing blood with her. As she watches Owen's&nbsp;
blood drip on the floor, Abby can't stand the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:58.880
hunger she's feeling. She collapses to the ground&nbsp;
and begins licking Owen's blood off of the floor.

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:02.480
Abby finally transforms into her actual&nbsp;
vampire figure with white cataract eyes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:06.880
unappealing facial warts, and sharp teeth. Abby&nbsp;
hisses at Owen to leave, and when he doesn't,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:11.680
she runs away. She climbs up a tree while overcome&nbsp;
with blood lust, waiting for the next victim.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:17.360
Meanwhile, Virginia is arguing with her boyfriend,&nbsp;
Larry, when suddenly Abby pounces. Fortunately,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:22.160
Larry manages to stop Abby from killing Virginia,&nbsp;
and he immediately rushes her to the hospital.&nbsp;

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:26.720
Later that day, the detective comes to question&nbsp;
Larry at the hospital. Unfortunately, the nurse&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:31.680
transfuses Virginia with six pints of blood. While&nbsp;
the detective talks with Larry, Virginia wakes up,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:35.920
gazing at her blood from the injection. When the&nbsp;
nurse opens the curtains, Virginia is drinking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:39.840
her own blood from her arm and then bursts into&nbsp;
flames, burning Virginia and the nurse alive.

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:44.240
Meanwhile, Owen seems confused and&nbsp;
surprised by what he recently learned.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:48.720
He looks for someone to talk to, so Owen heads to&nbsp;
see her mother, but it turns out she's sleeping.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:52.480
Meanwhile, Owen desperately calls his dad,&nbsp;
who doesn't take him seriously after Owen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:57.120
asks about evils. Owen starts to cry when his dad&nbsp;
shrugs off his ideas, wondering what he would do.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:00.960
His father hangs up the phone, and Owens&nbsp;
sobs harder with the phone in his hands.

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:06.240
Still, Owen tries to confront Abby. He knocks on&nbsp;
her unit and asks for permission to let him in.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:10.480
When he asks if she is a vampire, she appears&nbsp;
to be oblivious to the term and says she needs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:14.640
blood to survive He inquires as to her actual&nbsp;
age. She admits to being twelve again but says&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:18.560
she's been twelve years old for a long time.&nbsp;
He then asks about her father's whereabouts,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:22.480
to which she responds that he was not her&nbsp;
biological father. Owen came across an old&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:26.240
photograph of Abby and Father when the old man&nbsp;
was around twelve years old, while Abby appears&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:30.320
to be the same as she is now. Owen returns&nbsp;
home, fearful of what she might do to him.&nbsp;

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:35.360
The next day, Abby knocks on the door. She&nbsp;
asks if he could let her in, but Owen refuses.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:38.960
He inquires as to what would happen if he&nbsp;
didn't let her in. She responds with nothing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:43.520
and enters quietly and uninvitedly. However,&nbsp;
her skin begins to bleed almost immediately,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:46.320
telling him that that happens&nbsp;
when vampires are not invited.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:49.600
Feeling worried, Owen greets her with a hug&nbsp;
and finally gives her permission to enter.&nbsp;

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:54.000
Later on, Abby takes a shower while Owen&nbsp;
fixes her clothes covered with blood.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000
He dumps them into the garbage after washing&nbsp;
off the bloodstains. Owen cheerfully dances&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.120
while waiting for Abby in the shower, and&nbsp;
he even offers his mother's old dresses&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:05.360
for her to wear. When Owen's mother arrives&nbsp;
unexpectedly, Abby dashes across the window&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:08.080
from Owen's apartment to hers, even&nbsp;
though they are two stories apart.

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:12.240
The following day, Owen finds a note from Abby&nbsp;
asking him whether he would like to hang out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:16.480
with her that evening. He is lying on the&nbsp;
floor inside Abby's apartment. Meanwhile,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:19.840
based on Larry's description of Virginia's&nbsp;
attacker, the detective manages to trace&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:24.720
it to Abby, leading to her apartment. He breaks&nbsp;
in and carefully examines the place. Owen hides&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:29.120
immediately as the detective continues his search&nbsp;
for Abby. Finally, the man finds her asleep in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:34.320
bathtub. Because he can't see in the dark, he rips&nbsp;
open the foil covering the windows. Immediately,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:38.720
Abby's skin begins to crack when exposed to the&nbsp;
sunlight. Owen screams, giving Abby sufficient&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:42.560
time to jump on the detective and drink his&nbsp;
blood. As the man lies dying on the floor,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:46.480
he reaches out to Owen for help, but Owen closes&nbsp;
the bathroom door and leaves the man to his fate.&nbsp;

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:51.360
After feeding, Abby heads out of the bathroom&nbsp;
and hugs Owen from behind. Abby informs him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:54.800
that she must go away before the rest of the&nbsp;
police show up looking for the detective.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:58.960
With blood on her mouth, she kisses Owen&nbsp;
on his lips. Feeling down, Owen leaves her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:03.120
unit and enters the next door. That night, Owen&nbsp;
looks out the window to see Abby getting into a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:07.360
taxi to move away. The detective lies beneath&nbsp;
the basement where Owen took Abby for a pact.&nbsp;

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.760
Meanwhile, after Abby is gone, Owen returns&nbsp;
to his regular boring routine of going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:16.880
school and going home. One evening, he starts his&nbsp;
swimming lessons with Mr. Zoric. As he gets into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:20.720
his swimsuit and begins his swimming lesson, Kenny&nbsp;
and his friends gather Owen's things and start a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:25.520
fire in the dumpster behind the gym, forcing Mr.&nbsp;
Zoric to leave the pool area unattended. When Mr.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:29.200
Zoric goes to put out the fire, they lock him&nbsp;
out of the gym and go back into the pool, where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:33.520
Kenny's older brother Jimmy kicks everyone out of&nbsp;
the pool and makes Owen get back in. Jimmy asks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:37.600
Owen to either stay underwater for three minutes&nbsp;
or have one of his eyes poked out using his knife.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:43.040
Then Jimmy slams Owen into the pool. A minute&nbsp;
goes by, and the chaos begins in the gym.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:46.800
Owen hears his bullies screaming, then Jimmy's&nbsp;
severed head falls into the water, following&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:52.240
more body parts. Nearly drowned, Owen emerges from&nbsp;
the water and crawls out. When he raises his eyes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:56.640
he sees Abby's bloody feet standing in front&nbsp;
of him. Apparently, she crashed into the pool&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:56.640 --> 00:13:00.880
area through a skylight window and dismembered all&nbsp;
four bullies in a matter of seconds to save Owen.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:06.160
Upon seeing Abby, Owen smirks. They leave the&nbsp;
bloody pool with body parts all over the gym.

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:10.320
Later, Owen is sitting on a train bound for&nbsp;
an unknown destination while snowing outside.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:13.520
In front of him is a large trunk,&nbsp;
and Abby is tapping from the inside.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:16.880
Owen responds with a Morse Code tap,&nbsp;
telling her that the train started to move,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:20.480
and he then chews his favorite candy while&nbsp;
humming, eat some now, save some for later.&nbsp;

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:24.320
From the beginning, the story implies&nbsp;
Owen's fate as he is singing the tagline&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:27.840
of his favorite "Now And Later" candy.&nbsp;
He's singing the lines "eat some now,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:30.800
save some for later," which will&nbsp;
later become his responsibility.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:34.480
To provide blood for Abby, for her to feed&nbsp;
and save some, for him to have some supplies.&nbsp;

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:39.680
The story focuses tightly on Owen and Abby. Both&nbsp;
characters are sexually threatened or insecure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:43.840
in some way. Bullies refer to Owen as a "girl,"&nbsp;
and they seem obsessed with seeing his genitals&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:48.960
to confirm his sexuality. Abby, on the other hand,&nbsp;
feels insecure because she is limited to do usual&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:53.920
things. They immediately feel a bond with one&nbsp;
another. However, as Owen and Abby come closer,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:56.960
they are both afraid of intimacy and&nbsp;
contact due to their personal reasons,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:59.600
and their only sensual moments&nbsp;
are tender hugs and kisses.&nbsp;

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:03.440
Towards the ending, it's clear that Owen has&nbsp;
taken the role of Abby's protector and handler,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:06.080
and the two of them are on their&nbsp;
way to start a new life together.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:09.680
Abby will also look after him and save him from&nbsp;
growing up and functioning as a normal male.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:14.400
She'll be in charge of everything, which will&nbsp;
later become Owen's desire to surrender control.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:18.480
In the end, the price of not being a victim is to&nbsp;
be a servant, who Abby's former lover selflessly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:23.360
demonstrated. In the last part of the story, Owen&nbsp;
is still humming the tagline, "Eat some now, save&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:27.280
some for later," while eating his favorite candy,&nbsp;
implying the consequences of the choice he made.
