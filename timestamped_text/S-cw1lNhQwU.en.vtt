00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:01.829
Welcome to Moviecaps.

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:08.120
Today I will show you a crime, drama, history
film from 2008, that is based on a true story,

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:09.610
titled 21.

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:11.070
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.539
Watch out and take care.

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:19.680
Ben, an MIT mathematics major, is accepted
into Harvard, but cannot afford the $300,000

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:20.740
tuition.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.820
He applies for a scholarship that would cover
the entire cost, but is informed that only

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.400
1 of the 76 applicants will get it.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.390
Despite having high grades and test scores,
he faces fierce competition.

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.039
He needs to write an essay and is told by
the director that the scholarship will only

00:00:35.039 --> 00:00:37.300
go to whichever student dazzles him.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.469
Ben works at a men's clothing store with his
best friend Miles and is promoted to assistant

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:43.890
manager which makes $8 an hour.

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.789
He tells Miles about the essay and that he
has no idea what to write about, because he

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.949
hasn't done anything remarkable.

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:54.030
Ben is frustrated because even though he has
crushed exams, taken extracurriculars and

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.149
given up everything, the one thing stopping
him from going to Harvard is money.

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:00.719
They meet up at a bar with Cam to celebrate
Ben's birthday.

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.960
The 3 of them are trying to win a science
competition by building a self-driving car.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:11.070
Back at MIT, a professor, Micky Rosa is giving
a lecture on nonlinear equations.

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.790
He asks the class to explain Newton's method.

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.680
Ben mentions that Newton actually stole the
method from Joseph Raphson, who published

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.050
the same method 50 years earlier.

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.950
The professor is impressed and gives him a
chance for extra credit so he challenges Ben

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.230
with the Monty Hall problem, which he solves
successfully.

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:31.520
As class ends the professor checks Ben's most
recent test result to see 97%.

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.410
Ben, Miles and Cam are at a gym, playing basketball.

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:38.220
He notices a girl he likes- Jill.

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.490
She waves and he waves back, but turns out
she's waving at someone behind him.

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.311
Later that day as Ben is studying a fellow
student comes up and asks to follow him, he's

00:01:46.311 --> 00:01:48.410
a bit confused, but does so.

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:52.010
He's brought to a room that has some students
sitting at a blackjack table and professor

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:54.170
Rosa standing at a blackboard.

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.630
He tells Ben to call him Micky and invites
him to join the MIT Blackjack Team.

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.380
Ben is introduced to the team consisting of
Kianna, Fisher, Choi and Jill.

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.230
They explain that blackjack is beatable and
that they go to Las Vegas every weekend and

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:11.021
holiday and that a spot on their team has
opened up, because a previous member got a

00:02:11.021 --> 00:02:12.440
job at google.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.890
Ben is hesitant because he’s afraid to step
out of his comfort zone.

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.890
Jill says: “C’mon Ben, it'll be fun!”.

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.069
They go back and forth, Ben coming up with
excuses as to why he can't do it, and Micky

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.770
trying to convince him, but Ben ultimately
declines.

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:30.690
The next day Jills shows up at his job and
says she's looking for a tie.

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.780
Ben tries to help her pick one, but she's
actually there to try to convince him further,

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.730
saying that he should experience more things
in life.

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.670
Ben finally shows up at the blackjack club
and starts learning the system.

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:47.190
High cards have a value of -1, neutral cards
have no value and low cards are +1.

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.970
He practices counting cards and memorizes
the words that the team has assigned to each

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.130
high count.

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.440
Later, at a bar they explain the roles of
every member of the team.

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.990
Kianna, Choi and Jill are the spotters, they
sit at various blackjack tables only betting

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:02.240
the table minimum and keeping count.

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.710
When one of the tables reach a “hot” count
the player has an edge over the dealer so

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:09.800
they signal Ben or Fisher who are the big
players, who then stumble over to the table

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.380
like some drunk rich kid and bet big.

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.569
When the deck cools down, the big player leaves
the table.

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:18.650
Ben shows up to a dodgy alleyway for a trial
run.

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.090
He goes inside an underground casino where
his spotters are already sitting at tables.

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.970
Choi signals him that the deck is hot and
Ben sits down at the table.

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.849
Choi then uses the word “magazine” in
a sentence to inform Ben that the count is

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:33.730
+17 and he starts making big bets.

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.380
He's winning a lot and is exhilarated, smiling
constantly, when suddenly a bag is thrown

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.890
over his head and he's dragged into a back
room.

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.990
A deep voice keeps asking him: “what's the
count”.

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:48.020
He acts clueless but eventually gives in and
tells them it's +18.

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:51.440
Turns out this was a test whether he can keep
the count under pressure and is officially

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.060
welcomed to the team.

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.220
The next day they fly to Las Vegas.

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:00.160
They enter a hotel suite where Micky gives
each member a new identity and a disguise.

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.110
He further instructs Ben to act like they
dont know eachother and always order water,

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.700
tonic and lime and appear a little drunk.

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.770
At the Red Rock Casino, Kianna signals Ben.

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:13.140
He looks to the right and sees Fisher and
Choi at the next table.

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:18.090
He sits down and exchanges $10000 for chips
and after taking a sip of her drink, Kianna

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.050
exclaims “Too sweet”, which indicates
that the count is +16.

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:27.310
Ben doubles down on eights on his first hand,
the dealer goes over 21 and Ben wins, profiting

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:29.190
$4000 already.

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:33.070
On the next hand he gets a blackjack and wins
another $3000.

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:37.660
He goes on playing at the casino on different
tables, stacking chips along the way.

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.220
Seeing Ben winning so much, Fisher stares
in disbelief.

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.770
Come morning, Choi signals it's time to leave
and they head out.

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:48.270
The next day Ben is woken up by Jill, who
throws him his cut.

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:52.770
She tells him he did good- came in quick off
the count, wasn't afraid to play big, got

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.860
out when he was supposed to and made more
money than Fisher.

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.210
He tells her that he was pretty nervous at
first, but after a while it felt easy.

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:02.340
They are called for a team meeting.

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:03.530
Fisher shows up drunk.

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:08.050
Micky is pissed, because on 3 occasions, Fisher
played into a cold deck even when spotters

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:09.449
let him know that.

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:12.360
Micky tells Ben he did good and to keep it
up.

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.389
Fisher utters: “Beginners luck”, and denies
that he played wrong, but Micky puts him in

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:17.620
his place.

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:24.130
Ben is back at the dorm and stashes his cut
from the weekend- $16700 in the ceiling tiles.

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:27.699
Suddenly Miles and Cam walk in and he pretends
he's just jumping on the bed.

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:32.139
Miles asks where he was this weekend and says
he called like 15 times.

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:36.460
Ben makes up a lie about helping a cousin
move and says that he forgot his cell phone.

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:39.270
All 3 decide to go to a bar for some drinks.

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:42.430
Ben sees Jill at the counter and offers to
buy her a beer.

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:45.180
His 2 friends are stunned and keep staring
at them.

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.790
He goes to tell them to stop acting weird
to not freak her out, but they say that they

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:51.460
are probably more freaked out than she is.

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.270
Ben and Jill are on a train.

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:56.680
He asks her whether she came into the store
to ask him to join the team because Micky

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:58.110
asked her to.

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:01.620
She says that he's the smartest guy she knows
and that's why he's on the team and that's

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:03.020
why she went to the store.

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.790
He tries to kiss her but she pulls back.

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:09.850
He is embarrassed and starts apologizing,
but she tells him to not worry about it and

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:13.330
that she just doesn't want to complicate things
because they work together.

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:16.199
She says it's her stop so she gets off the
train.

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:20.460
Over the coming weekends, the team is flown
to Las Vegas Valley and Ben comes to enjoy

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:25.620
his luxurious life as a high roller, but there's
still 1 thing he can't get off his mind.

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:29.070
Every trip he makes more money than in 5 years
at his old job.

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:33.710
In Boston he is just Ben Capmpell, but in
Vegas he can be whoever he wants to be.

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:37.030
It was too good to be true and felt like it
was never going to end.

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:41.720
The head of security, Cole Williams, has been
monitoring the team and begins to focus on

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:44.820
Ben, suspecting that he may be counting cards.

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:49.200
Turns out he is also a card counter, but prefers
to be on the other side of the hustle.

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:53.160
For the first time, life was easy for Ben,
nothing cost too much and nothing was out

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:54.259
of reach.

00:06:54.259 --> 00:06:58.280
College parties with frat dudes were upgraded
to something more interesting.

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:02.850
Fisher becomes extremely jealous of Ben's
success and one day, while drunk, sits down

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:06.340
at Ben's table and starts dropping hints that
they know each other.

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:10.550
Meanwhile Williams is watching them on tape
and notices that Kianna only bets table minimum

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:13.590
and that Ben only appears after she gives
him a signal.

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:17.590
He goes to confront them, but Fisher has caused
a commotion and they leave before Williams

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:18.960
can get to them.

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:22.030
At a bar, Micky removes Fisher from the team.

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:26.380
He informs the rest that the casino is changing
their chips in 24 hours, which means that

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:30.880
they need to exchange them for cash, which
they can't do because of Fisher's antics.

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:34.470
Ben suggests they use the dancers to exchange
the chips for them.

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:36.430
Micky calls him a genius.

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:41.020
Later that day Jill invites Ben to her suite
and they have a romantic night and make love.

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:44.871
Ben's new secret life causes him to neglect
his role in the science competition, which

00:07:44.871 --> 00:07:46.530
estranges him from his friends.

00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:50.699
He shows up late to a meeting with them and
gives them the wrong part for their project.

00:07:50.699 --> 00:07:53.900
They are disappointed and tell him that he
isn't as committed to the project as they

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:56.340
are and decide to keep going without him.

00:07:56.340 --> 00:08:00.110
During the next trip to Las Vegas, he is emotionally
distracted.

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:02.650
He gets an unlucky outcome on a big hand.

00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:06.229
He lets his emotions get the better of him
and fails to walk away from the table when

00:08:06.229 --> 00:08:07.990
signaled by Kianna.

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:10.910
Jill steps in and tries to get him out, but
fails.

00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:14.320
He ends up losing an extra $200,000.

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:18.840
Micky is furious and even when Ben apologizes,
saying that this is his first mistake and

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:22.770
others try to back him up, Micky leaves the
team and says that Ben will have to pay the

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:26.069
$200,000 he lost one way or another.

00:08:26.069 --> 00:08:29.850
Ben and the remaining team decide that they
will continue to play blackjack without Micky

00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:33.670
who took a 50% cut, reasoning that they don't
even need him.

00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:38.169
Jill is against the idea, reminding Ben that
he only did this to pay for Harvard, but even

00:08:38.169 --> 00:08:41.550
though he had made enough money, he now wants
to keep going.

00:08:41.550 --> 00:08:45.410
They go back to the tables and are winning,
but Micky is lurking in the shadows and tips

00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:47.089
off security.

00:08:47.089 --> 00:08:50.620
Williams takes Ben to a backroom and beats
him up while explaining that all casinos will

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:54.589
soon have face recognition software so his
days were numbered anyway.

00:08:54.589 --> 00:08:57.560
Ben is also told that Williams and Micky go
way back.

00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:02.060
He used to chase and beat him up too, which
is why Micky doesn't play himself anymore.

00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:06.410
Ben goes back to MIT and reads a letter saying
that he is ineligible for graduation because

00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:11.040
one of his courses, taught by an associate
of Micky's, is marked as incomplete.

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:13.830
He goes inside and finds his dorm room trashed.

00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:16.320
The money he's been stashing away is missing.

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:17.840
He has lost everything.

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:22.240
He visits Jill and says he doesn't want to
lose her too, and apologizes for his actions

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:23.899
back in Vegas.

00:09:23.899 --> 00:09:28.770
Miles and Can manage to win the robotics competition
even without Ben, who is there watching.

00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:32.610
He apologizes to Miles for letting him down
and explains everything he's been up to and

00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:33.860
they make up.

00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:37.810
Ben goes to see Micky and persuades him to
make a final trip to Vegas before the casinos

00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:42.200
install biometric software, but this time
they will all use disguises and Micky will

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:44.990
be the second big player to make a big return.

00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:49.610
They're in a casino, making big bets, stacking
chips and enjoying themselves.

00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:54.360
They manage to profit $640,000, before Williams
shows up.

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:58.060
Jill signals them and they scramble, throwing
chips in a bag and taking off.

00:09:58.060 --> 00:09:59.880
A chase ensues.

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:04.350
They run around slot machines and enter the
staff area, where Micky convinces Ben to throw

00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:06.750
him the chips and says they should separate.

00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:09.740
Micky manages to get out and hops into a limo.

00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:13.921
He's ecstatic, thinking he got away with all
of the money, but as he opens the bag, he

00:10:13.921 --> 00:10:16.190
realizes that the chips are fake.

00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:19.540
Ben switched the real chips with fake ones
while they were running.

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:23.170
Turns out that Williams has always held a
grudge against Micky, because the last time

00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:25.600
he saw him he got away with massive gains.

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:29.290
So he made a deal with Ben to lure Micky back
to Vegas to catch him.

00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:33.180
In turn Ben would be allowed to keep whatever
they make that day, but when Ben and Jill

00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:37.660
exit the casino Williams walks up and explains
that he needs the money for retirement, and

00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:41.680
Ben being as intelligent as he is will figure
out a way to succeed, so he takes the bag

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:42.680
at gunpoint.

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:43.680
The limo Micky got in was set up by Williams
and he is brought to the same room where Ben

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:44.680
was held.

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:47.170
Turns out that Ben's long time friends are
also pretty good at card counting and the

00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:50.620
6 person team makes a lot of money despite
Williams' robbery.

00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:55.330
As Ben is recounting this story to the scholarship
director, he looks pretty damn dazzled.

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:57.260
The End.

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:58.830
Thank you for watching!
