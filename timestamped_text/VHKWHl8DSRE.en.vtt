00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.520
Story Recapped here. Today, I'm going to explain&nbsp;
a supernatural horror film called "It Follows."&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.560
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.120
In a peaceful neighbourhood, Annie storms&nbsp;
out of her home as if running for her life.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.480
The sound of the door opening causes her to stop&nbsp;
in the middle of the road. She slowly backs away&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.720
while her eyes trail at something. Her father&nbsp;
comes out of the house and calls out to her. Annie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.440
lies to her neighbour and her&nbsp;
father, saying that she's okay.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.080
Finally, she circles back to her home&nbsp;
with her father following inside.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.400
But she frantically exits again, now with&nbsp;
her car keys in hand, and drives away.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.640
Even as she's driving, she keeps&nbsp;
looking over her shoulderâ€”panic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.800
in her eyes and ignoring her ringing phone.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:44.720
That evening, Annie parks her car by the beach.&nbsp;
Shaken and crying, she finally answers her phone.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.040
With her eyes focused on the space around&nbsp;
her car, she apologizes to her father and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.200
tells him that she loves him. Annie is tired&nbsp;
of running and waits for what lies ahead.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.840
Annie is found at the beach in the morning,&nbsp;
dead with her leg morbidly bent and broken.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.120
In another part of the suburbs, Jay&nbsp;
relaxes in the pool. Her sister, Kelly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.080
invites her to watch a movie with her friends,&nbsp;
but Jay refuses. She has a date later that day.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.040
After Kelly leaves, Jay smiles and calls out&nbsp;
the boys next door who are watching her swim.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.840
Inside their home, Kelly is watching a&nbsp;
movie with her friends, Paul and Yara,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.560
while their mom is at the dining table. Jay heads&nbsp;
up to her room, quietly preparing for her date.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.680
At the movie theatre, Jay teaches Hugh, her&nbsp;
date, a game that she and her sister play.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.920
Hugh chooses a person in the theatre he&nbsp;
wants to trade places with, and Jay has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.040
to guess who he chose. When it's Hugh's turn to&nbsp;
guess, he points to a girl in a yellow dress.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:44.480
But Jay doesn't see her. Dread fills Hugh. He&nbsp;
immediately urges Jay to leave the theatre with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:49.600
him. He claims that he didn't feel comfortable&nbsp;
being there. They continue the date with dinner,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.640
and everything seemed to be going well&nbsp;
despite what happened in the theatre.

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.960
The next day, Jay walks with her&nbsp;
sister. They talk about Hugh.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.440
Jay is giddy about him but is still&nbsp;
concerned about his behaviour in the theatre.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.000
Even though she accepted his story that he wasn't&nbsp;
feeling well, Jay is still suspicious that he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.480
was hiding something. Before reaching their&nbsp;
house, Kelly waves to their neighbour, Greg.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.320
During their next date, Hugh takes Jay out to a&nbsp;
secluded area. The two spend a passionate night&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:21.360
in his car for the first time. Afterwards, Jay&nbsp;
reminisces about her views on love until Hugh&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.560
chloroforms her. Jay tries to fight him back,&nbsp;
but Hugh overpowers her, and she passes out.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.680
Jay wakes up tied to a wheelchair&nbsp;
in an abandoned building.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.840
Hugh apologizes and assures her that he won't&nbsp;
hurt her--that he only needed time to explain&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.240
things to her. An entity will start to follow&nbsp;
her, and it will kill her if it catches her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.800
It used to follow him, and now he passed it on&nbsp;
to her. It can look like anyone, even someone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.680
that she knows. The dazed Jay starts screaming&nbsp;
for help, still in disbelief of what he said,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.720
until Hugh reels her to the edge of the&nbsp;
building to show that it was coming.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.160
Jay sees a strange woman slowly walking towards&nbsp;
the building. Hugh instructs her that she has to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.000
sleep with someone else to pass it along and&nbsp;
that if it kills her, it will come after him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.960
next. Confused and afraid, Jay cries as Hugh&nbsp;
takes her back in his car and drives away.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.880
Kelly and her friends play cards back&nbsp;
at their house when they witness Hugh&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.560
dropping off Jay in the middle of the&nbsp;
road. The three rush to her aid and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.840
calls the cops, who interrogate the&nbsp;
distraught Jay about what happened.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.320
The police try to track down Hugh, but they&nbsp;
couldn't find him since he had used a fake name.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.640
Days later, Jay is still struggling&nbsp;
to make sense of what happened.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.680
While in the bathroom, a ball bounces off the&nbsp;
window, startling her. She looks out the window,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.480
not seeing the boy from next door&nbsp;
peeking at her from the window.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.680
At school, Jay attends a class. She&nbsp;
sees an old woman outside the window,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.640
seemingly heading towards her.&nbsp;
The old woman looks out of place,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.480
but no one else seemed to mind her. Hugh's&nbsp;
warnings about the entity come back to her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.000
and she hurriedly leaves the class.&nbsp;
The entity gets close to her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.960
and she confirms that the students around don't&nbsp;
see it. Scared, she gets into her car and leaves.

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.240
Jay heads to the ice cream shop where Kelly&nbsp;
and Paul work. She tells them the story Hugh&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:03.040
told her. None of them could believe it, not&nbsp;
even Jay. But Paul offers to stay at their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.440
house for the night nonetheless to watch over&nbsp;
them. Yara joins them to sleepover as well.

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:12.640
That evening, Jay couldn't sleep and joins&nbsp;
Paul in the living room to watch a movie.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.040
Paul sees Jay's unease and tries to comfort her.

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:20.320
While reminiscing about their childhood, they&nbsp;
hear the kitchen window breaking. Paul goes to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.280
investigate but claims that no one was there.&nbsp;
He heads upstairs to wake up Kelly, leaving Jay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.680
alone. She walks into the kitchen nervously&nbsp;
and sees a woman there, limping towards her.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:35.200
Jay screams and rushes upstairs to her&nbsp;
room. Kelly and Paul beg her to let them in,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.400
still convinced that there's&nbsp;
no one else in the house. Jay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.560
who's starting to believe Hugh's story about&nbsp;
the creature, collapses in fear and panic with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:47.120
Kelly comforting her. A still sleepy Yara&nbsp;
knocks on the door, and Kelly opens it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.480
despite Jay's warnings. Jay is relieved that&nbsp;
Yara is alone, standing at the doorway. But a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.720
tall man appears behind Yara. Jay screams&nbsp;
and climbs out of the balcony to escape.

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.800
Outside, Greg spots Jay riding away on a bicycle,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.840
with her friends and sister yelling for her. Jay&nbsp;
stops at a nearby playground and sits on a swing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:08.320
set. She looks around, wary of every sound,&nbsp;
thinking that the entity will catch up to her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.800
When she sees movement in the distance,&nbsp;
she freezes until Paul calls her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:18.640
The others try to calm her down. Greg catches up&nbsp;
to them, curious about what happened. Jay decides&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:23.840
that she needs to find Hugh to figure out what&nbsp;
was really happening. Greg offers to help them.

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:27.200
They visit the address Hugh gave Jay when&nbsp;
they were dating and sees that it's an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:32.080
abandoned-looking house. They investigate the&nbsp;
items littered in the place, hoping to find clues&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.880
that Hugh might have left behind. Paul finds a&nbsp;
high school photo of Hugh with a girl. Recognizing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:41.920
the school's logo, they track him down and&nbsp;
discover that his real name is Jeff Redmond. Kelly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:46.880
suggests telling the police, but Jay decides not&nbsp;
to. She wants to get answers from him directly.

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:52.400
They visit Jeff's real address, where Jay meets&nbsp;
his mother. She recognizes her face, realizing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:57.360
that the entity had taken Jeff's mother's form&nbsp;
during the first night she saw it. Jeff apologizes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:02.080
to Jay and tells her more about his story. He&nbsp;
says that the curse was passed down to him after&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:07.040
having a one-night stand with a girl from a bar.&nbsp;
Jeff insists that it's real and Jay should pass&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:11.280
it to someone else, but her friends are still&nbsp;
sceptical about it, thinking it's just a trick.

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:16.400
Greg invites them to his family's&nbsp;
lakehouse to get away. While Jay sleeps,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.840
Paul watches over her, considering Jeff's&nbsp;
suggestion of Jay passing the curse.

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.720
The following day, Greg teaches Jay how&nbsp;
to use a revolver to protect herself.

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:30.480
While hanging out by the shore with Paul, Kelly,&nbsp;
and Yara, the entity takes in Yara's form and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:35.280
attacks Jay. Paul grabs a lounge chair and hits&nbsp;
it despite not being able to see the entity.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:40.560
It releases Jay but shoves Paul back. They run&nbsp;
into the shed, where Jay grabs the revolver and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:45.520
starts shooting the entity. It collapses but&nbsp;
gets back up immediately, seemingly unharmed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:49.920
Jay shuts the door, realizing that she&nbsp;
can't harm it with a gun, and recoils back.

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:55.680
The entity bangs on the door until it creates&nbsp;
a hole. Jay stares at the spot, expecting the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:01.200
entity to crawl inside. But instead of it, Greg&nbsp;
looks inside, asking what's going on. He still&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:06.080
refuses to believe the entity is real, having not&nbsp;
witnessed Jay getting attacked. When he leaves,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:11.360
Jay crawls slowly towards the door, wondering if&nbsp;
it was safe. But the entity looks into the hole,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:14.375
now looking like the boy who lives next door to&nbsp;
their house. It screeches as it goes inside the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:14.375 --> 00:07:19.040
shed. Jay rushes to open another exit and takes&nbsp;
Greg's car, the entity still following behind.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:22.880
Panicked and distressed, Jay crashes&nbsp;
the vehicle into a cornfield.

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:27.200
She wakes up in the hospital with a broken&nbsp;
arm and her friends asleep at her side.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:31.920
Jay looks out to the open door, listening to&nbsp;
the sound of footsteps with a shaky breath.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:37.440
She waits for the entity to walk in, but&nbsp;
instead, a doctor walks past her room. Relieved,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:42.400
she turns to Greg. Tired of her situation,&nbsp;
Jay finally decides to do as Jeff suggested,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:46.800
passing down the curse to someone. Greg and Jay&nbsp;
have intercourse that evening in the hospital.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:52.160
Days later, Greg goes about his life normally&nbsp;
without seeing the entity. Despite this, Jay still&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:57.920
confines herself in her room, scared. She watches&nbsp;
Greg's house one night from her window vigilantly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:03.040
in case it comes back. She spots a person&nbsp;
walking to Greg's house. It breaks the window&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:07.840
as Jay starts calling Greg. He doesn't answer&nbsp;
the phone, and the entity has entered the house.

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:12.960
Jay runs to Greg's house to warn him, but the&nbsp;
creature is already in his bedroom, banging&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:17.760
on his door while looking like his mother. Jay&nbsp;
watches the entity attack Greg. She's too late.

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:22.480
Knowing that she's next, she drives away in&nbsp;
grief and fear of what she just witnessed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:24.960
She stops near the beach and falls asleep.

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:28.720
In the morning, she spots three men on a boat. She&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:31.440
begins to undress and swims into&nbsp;
the water to meet with the men.

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:36.240
Back in her home, Paul visits Jay and&nbsp;
offers to let her pass the curse to him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:40.000
but she refuses. Paul confesses&nbsp;
that he likes her and questions why&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.800
she chose to pass it on to Greg. Jay thought&nbsp;
he'd be okay because he wasn't scared.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:50.240
She regrets having done so. Looking around her&nbsp;
room, Paul gets an idea on how to stop the entity.

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:55.520
As they drive away from her house, Jay spots&nbsp;
the entity, looking like her grandfather,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:59.920
on the roof. The entity has killed the men she was&nbsp;
with at the boat and is now back to hunting her.

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:04.880
Jay, Paul, Kelly and Yara go to a closed&nbsp;
pool to prepare to face the entity.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:09.520
They set up electrical items around the pool while&nbsp;
Jay goes in the water, waiting for it to arrive.

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:13.040
A thunderstorm rages outside while they wait.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:17.120
Jay finally spots the entity entering.&nbsp;
Hearing the fear in her voice,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:22.000
Kelly asks her what it looked like, but Jay&nbsp;
refuses to tell her. Jay freaks out, wanting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.480
to get out of the pool. But Paul encourages her&nbsp;
to stay until the entity goes in the water with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:29.360
her. But instead of going in the water, the entity&nbsp;
starts throwing the electrical items at her.

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:34.480
Jay points at the entity to help her friends&nbsp;
attack it as it continues to hurl items at her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:38.240
causing her to sink in the water. She&nbsp;
resurfaces and looks at the entity,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:40.880
who now wears the face of her deceased father.&nbsp;
This is why she didn't want to tell her sister.

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:46.160
Paul grabs a gun, relying on Jay's directions to&nbsp;
shoot at it. With the entity invisible to him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:49.120
he gets too close, nearly getting caught by it. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:51.680
takes a shot, seeing the floating hairdryer in&nbsp;
front of him, but accidentally hits Yara's leg.

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:56.400
It continues throwing things at Jay, hitting&nbsp;
her on the arm. Kelly grabs a blanket and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:01.200
throws it over the entity to help Paul. When&nbsp;
she finally cloaks the entity, Paul shoots the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:05.760
entity on the head before it collapses into the&nbsp;
water. Jay hurriedly swims to the side, but the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:10.800
entity grabs her by the leg, pulling her down.&nbsp;
Paul continues to fire the gun into the water,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:15.280
estimating its position. He finally shoots&nbsp;
it on the head again, and Jay is free.

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:16.880
Kelly helps Jay get out of the pool.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:22.080
Paul asks her if the entity was still alive.&nbsp;
Jay carefully takes a peek at the pool to see.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:26.720
When she looks into the water, blood is&nbsp;
spreading, turning the pool completely red.

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:30.960
After the event, Paul and Jay&nbsp;
spend an intimate night together.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:35.360
When Jay is asleep, Paul drives around&nbsp;
and spots a couple of prostitutes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:39.120
An idea forms in his head: a way to&nbsp;
divert the entity if it was still alive.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.720
Jay and Paul walk together, hand-in-hand.&nbsp;
They enjoy the little peace that they have,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:47.280
not noticing the figure walking&nbsp;
behind them in the distance.
