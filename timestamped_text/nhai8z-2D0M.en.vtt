00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:06.480
Story Recapped here. Today, I'm going to explain&nbsp;
an action, drama, sci-fi film called “I, Robot.”&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.600
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:15.520
In 2035, robotics has advanced significantly&nbsp;
to where robots are now as common as people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:20.320
on the streets. Though robots and humans&nbsp;
live in cohabitation, robots still follow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.840
every human’s command. Three robotics laws&nbsp;
govern robots: robots shall not harm humans,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.840
robots shall obey humans, and robots&nbsp;
shall protect themselves from harm.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:36.320
Detective Del Spooner is a cop who clings to the&nbsp;
old ways. He distrusts robots and considers them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.840
nothing but tin cans that can talk. Spooner heads&nbsp;
to work when he sees a robot running with a purse.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:47.360
He pursues the robot, commanding it to stop, but&nbsp;
the robot keeps running. He finally tackles it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.040
down after chasing it, but he’s surprised&nbsp;
to learn the robot is just trying to bring&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.600
its owner her purse that she had forgotten.&nbsp;
Onlookers laugh at Spooner for thinking a robot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:01.440
could be capable of a crime. At the station,&nbsp;
his boss, John, hears about Spooner’s latest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.880
incident and tells him his distaste for robots is&nbsp;
misplaced. John then asks Spooner to specify the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:12.160
number of robots that have ever committed&nbsp;
a crime. Spooner sheepishly answers zero.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:17.760
Spooner then gets a call about a suicide incident&nbsp;
at USR, a significant robotics company, and heads&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:23.200
there to investigate. He finds out that renowned&nbsp;
robotics engineer, Alfred Lanning, had fallen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.480
to his death. In a hologram message, Lanning&nbsp;
explicitly asks Spooner to be called to the scene.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.120
Spooner stands over a lifeless Lanning,&nbsp;
perplexed as to why he would kill himself.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.960
Spooner then meets with URS CEO Lawrence Robertson&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.760
to talk about the incident. Robertson&nbsp;
praises Lanning and mourns the loss,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.600
saying the advancement in robotics wouldn’t&nbsp;
have been possible without Lanning.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.920
He offers to help in any way he could, feeling&nbsp;
at fault for not seeing signs or behavior that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.800
Lanning may have shown that would have indicated&nbsp;
suicidal thoughts. Spooner then makes an insulting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:00.080
remark, antagonizing the company. Spooner and&nbsp;
Robertson then depart, clearly in bitter terms.

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:06.000
At an elevator, robot psychologist Susan&nbsp;
Calvin accompanies Spooner into the robotic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.440
labs. Spooner asks Calvin if she noticed strange&nbsp;
behavior indicative of Lanning being suicidal,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.080
and Calvin answers no. Spooner asks for&nbsp;
surveillance footage, and Calvin shows him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.680
surveillance strips dotted throughout the&nbsp;
building. This connects to the building’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.200
central operating core, the Virtual Interactive&nbsp;
Kinetic Intelligence, or Viki for short. Calvin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.920
says that Viki is Lanning’s first creation, and it&nbsp;
has designed most of the city’s security systems.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.800
Spooner asks Viki for footage of the laboratory&nbsp;
where Lanning fell, but the footage has been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.600
corrupted. They then enter the laboratory and&nbsp;
look for more clues. Lanning’s lab is filled&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.320
with different robotic parts and experimental&nbsp;
models. Spooner tries smashing the window and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.160
notes that an elderly Lanning wouldn’t have had&nbsp;
sufficient strength to break through the window.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.880
Spooner looks through the mess of&nbsp;
robotic parts and uncovers an NS-5 robot,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.840
the company’s newest model set to be released&nbsp;
soon. The robot suddenly jumps out, scaring&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.960
Spooner and Calvin. Calvin tells Spooner to calm&nbsp;
down as the robot is incapable of harming them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:08.800
Spooner keeps his gun pointed at the NS-5, and it&nbsp;
grabs the gun out of Calvin’s hand. It tries to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:14.080
escape, but Viki closes the door. The NS-5 then&nbsp;
jumps out through the window and sprints away.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.120
Spooner and Calvin follow, ending up at a&nbsp;
robotics factory. Spooner looks through the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.480
hundreds of robots at the factory and sees one of&nbsp;
the robots peaking at him, and he chases after it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.640
Spooner and Calvin weave through the robots&nbsp;
until the NS-5 throws Spooner to the ground.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.040
The robot then walks up to him and&nbsp;
asks him the nature of its existence.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.080
It then escapes, but the police&nbsp;
quickly corner it and capture it.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.240
At the station, Spooner maintains&nbsp;
his notion that the robot could be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.320
responsible for Lanning’s death. Spooner&nbsp;
asks if he can have five minutes with the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.760
robot to ask a few questions,&nbsp;
and John reluctantly agrees.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.920
Spooner asks the robot why it had murdered&nbsp;
Lanning, and the robot answers it didn’t;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:57.040
it was simply hiding in the lab, in fear. Spooner&nbsp;
says robots don’t have emotions and therefore&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:02.080
cannot feel frightened. The NS-5 answers that&nbsp;
it does and says it has even experienced dreams.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.600
Spooner says that’s not possible, as robots&nbsp;
are a mere imitation of life. He then tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:12.400
the NS-5 that he theorizes Lanning may have tried&nbsp;
programming emotions into it, but something went&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.520
wrong, and the robot ended up killing Lanning.&nbsp;
The robot repeats that it didn’t murder Lanning,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:22.320
smashing its fists into the table in anger. It&nbsp;
then tells Spooner that Lanning named it Sonny.

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.680
Sonny says that it didn’t know why Lanning would&nbsp;
want to kill himself. In the days leading up to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:32.640
Lanning’s death, the robot says that it noticed&nbsp;
Lanning had become scared. It then tells Spooner&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:37.280
that Lanning had asked it a favor. Sonny says that&nbsp;
it obeyed Lanning’s order out of love for him.

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.720
Robertson arrives and defends the company,&nbsp;
saying robots are incapable of murder.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.960
The three laws wouldn’t allow for it to happen,&nbsp;
and he adds that the definition of murder is a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.520
person killing another person. He says the&nbsp;
police can’t charge the robot for murder,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.200
and this whole incident would have to&nbsp;
be classified as an industrial accident.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.240
He then orders the immediate removal&nbsp;
and decommissioning of Sonny.

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.760
Spooner is unsatisfied with the investigation’s&nbsp;
findings and thinks there’s more to the case.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.840
He remembers what Sonny had said about Lanning&nbsp;
being scared and heads to Lanning’s abandoned&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:12.880
estate. There, he finds a demolition robot&nbsp;
set to destroy the home the following day.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:16.480
He enters the house and finds the&nbsp;
same surveillance strips in USR,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:21.440
also in Lanning’s home. On his way out, he&nbsp;
sees the demolition robot has turned itself&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:26.800
on. The robot smashes through the wall, and&nbsp;
Spooner runs for his life. He barely makes it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.560
out of the house, but he escapes through&nbsp;
the door, diving into a pool of water.

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:34.000
He later arrives at Calvin’s&nbsp;
home and tells her what happened.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:39.360
Spooner says that Lanning’s home appeared as if&nbsp;
he hadn’t been home in weeks. He theorizes that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:44.800
someone may have kept watch on Lanning, maybe even&nbsp;
keeping him prisoner in his lab. Spooner suspects&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.720
that Lanning may have discovered a problem&nbsp;
with the robots, and Robertson silenced him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:54.240
Spooner maintains that USR is trying to cover&nbsp;
something up. Calvin thinks Spooner is wrong and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:59.520
attributes his paranoia to a distrust of robots in&nbsp;
general. She says he doesn’t care about Lanning’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:04.640
death, and he just wants robots to be evil.&nbsp;
Spooner counters by saying robots are cold,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:10.400
calculating, and soulless, and humans shouldn’t&nbsp;
trust them. Calvin then says robots are safe,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:14.560
programmable, and predictable, and unlike&nbsp;
humans, they would never harm anyone.

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:19.600
The next day, Spooner sees hordes of&nbsp;
NS-5s being released onto the streets,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:24.240
replacing the NS-4s. The NS-5s are&nbsp;
more sophisticated, better designed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:29.280
and now have an uplink direct to Viki. People are&nbsp;
happy and cheer at the arrival of the new robots.

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.960
Spooner reviews old recordings&nbsp;
of Lanning at his desk,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:36.720
where he hears him say that robots in&nbsp;
the future would have dreams and secrets.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:41.200
At USR, Calvin prepares Sonny for&nbsp;
decommissioning. Sonny wakes up and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:45.760
tells her it had been dreaming. Calvin tells&nbsp;
Sonny he’ll be decommissioned the following day,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:50.800
and Sonny says he would prefer not to die.&nbsp;
Calvin is taken aback by the robot’s responses.

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:57.280
Spooner is on a highway when two trucks containing&nbsp;
NS-5s sandwich him. The NS-5s all jump out of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:02.000
trucks and start attacking him. They all leap&nbsp;
onto his car and try to grab him, but Spooner&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.360
fights back. The robots swarm his vehicle, but&nbsp;
he’s able to dodge the robots’ punches and grabs.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:13.360
Spooner tries to maneuver away, but the NS-5s&nbsp;
still cling to him. He spins his car around,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:18.560
ricocheting most of the robots away, but he ends&nbsp;
up crashing with the transport trucks. Spooner&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:25.520
slams into a wall. He gets out of his car, dazed,&nbsp;
but a lone NS-5 appears, and they start fighting.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:31.680
The NS-5 slams Spooner around several times, but&nbsp;
Spooner arms himself with a metal club. The NS-5&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:36.560
disarms Spooner and starts hitting him with it.&nbsp;
Spooner shields himself, but his left arm gets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:42.800
mangled. Beneath his skin, a metal casing is seen,&nbsp;
along with wires and robotic circuitry. The robot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:47.840
is surprised, and Spooner uses the opportunity&nbsp;
to gain the upper hand. Police come, and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:53.520
robot dives into a fire. John and other officers&nbsp;
arrive, and Spooner tells him robots attacked him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:59.760
John says the tunnels are empty, devoid of any&nbsp;
robots. Spooner shouts at John, frustrated that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:05.040
nobody is taking him seriously. John disapproves&nbsp;
of Spooner’s behavior and takes his badge away.

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:09.440
At USR, Calvin discovers that&nbsp;
Sonny isn’t connected to Viki,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:12.880
and it has a thicker alloy&nbsp;
compared to the rest of the NS-5s.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:16.000
Taking a look into Sonny’s brain,&nbsp;
Calvin discovers Sonny has two.

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:19.680
Calvin later visits Spooner and&nbsp;
tells him about her discovery.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:24.160
Sonny’s second brain allows it to choose&nbsp;
whether or not it will follow the three laws.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:29.600
Spooner thinks that whatever is happening&nbsp;
at USR, Sonny is the key to figuring it out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:34.000
Calvin sees scars on Spooner’s arm and&nbsp;
chest and realizes he has robotic implants.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:39.280
This is the reason why he and Lanning were close&nbsp;
to each other. Calvin examines Spooner’s arm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:43.840
and sees that his entire left arm, a lung,&nbsp;
and several ribs are all robotic implants.

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:47.840
Spooner then tells the story of&nbsp;
how he got the robotic implants.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:53.360
He was on his way home when a semi-truck slammed&nbsp;
into a car. The car then slammed into Spooner’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:58.880
car, and they both plunged into a river. The other&nbsp;
vehicle had a father and his daughter inside. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:03.680
father died instantly, but the daughter got&nbsp;
trapped. As they sank, Spooner saw the young&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:09.760
girl and realized none of them would survive. To&nbsp;
his surprise, an NS-4 robot arrives to save them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:13.920
He commanded the robot to save the little&nbsp;
girl, but the robot chose to save him instead.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:20.480
He later found out that the robot decided Spooner&nbsp;
had a 45% chance of survival, so he was chosen.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:26.240
The little girl only had an 11% chance. This is&nbsp;
the root of Spooner’s contempt for the robots.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:30.400
He argues that no human being would have looked&nbsp;
at the situation and calculated who would have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:35.920
a better chance of survival. If it were that&nbsp;
little girl’s parents, 11% would have been enough.

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:40.160
They make their way back to USR, and Calvin&nbsp;
wonders why Lanning would make a robot that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:44.240
can choose not to obey the three laws.&nbsp;
Spooner then speculates that Lanning&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:48.320
probably gave Sonny a way to keep secrets;&nbsp;
Spooner thinks Lanning gave Sonny dreams.

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:53.360
At USR, they ask Sonny about the&nbsp;
dreams. Sonny draws a picture of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:55.440
the dream showing a man standing on a hill,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:55.440 --> 00:10:00.720
freeing robots from enslavement. Calvin speculates&nbsp;
that the one standing on the hill is Sonny.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:05.280
Calvin asks Sonny why Lanning created it, and&nbsp;
Sonny answers that it doesn’t know, but there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:10.400
has to be a purpose for the creation. Sonny then&nbsp;
tells Spooner that in the dream, the man standing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:15.280
on the hill is not Sonny but Spooner. Guards then&nbsp;
arrive and escort the pair to Robertson’s office.

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:19.440
Robertson meets with them and tells them&nbsp;
they know about Sonny and the two brains.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:25.040
Robertson is trying his best to keep the situation&nbsp;
a secret. He says that on the days leading up to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:30.160
the suicide, Lanning had slowly become disturbed.&nbsp;
He still doesn’t know why Sonny was built,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:34.880
but he knows its implications if it reaches the&nbsp;
public. Robertson asserts that there’s no grand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:40.000
scheme. He just wants Sonny’s creation to remain a&nbsp;
secret, hoping Lanning didn’t make more than one.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.240
Spooner leaves, aiming to head to the&nbsp;
location in Sonny’s dream. Meanwhile,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:49.200
Calvin prepares to decommission Sonny. Calvin&nbsp;
prepares to inject nanites into Sonny’s brain,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:54.400
and Sonny asks if the process would be painful.&nbsp;
Calvin gets teary-eyed and grasps Sonny’s hand.

00:10:55.280 --> 00:11:01.120
Spooner arrives at the location and sees container&nbsp;
vans full of NS-4s. The robots are all curious,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:05.920
watching Spooner make his way through. Calvin&nbsp;
then takes the NS-5 and injects the nanites&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:11.520
into its brain. The NS-5’s brain synapses slowly&nbsp;
turn off, and the decommissioning is completed.

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:17.120
Spooner reaches the hill and takes out Lanning’s&nbsp;
hologram. He asks if there’s a problem with the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:22.160
three laws, and Lanning’s hologram says the three&nbsp;
laws would only lead to one outcome - revolution.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:28.160
Spooner hears a noise coming from the distant&nbsp;
containers and investigates. He discovers NS-5s,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:33.600
destroying all the NS-4s in containment. Spooner&nbsp;
runs, but the robots spot him and chase him down.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:38.560
He’s only saved when a group of NS-4s detects&nbsp;
that he’s in danger and comes to the rescue.

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:44.480
Hordes of NS-5s are released to the streets and&nbsp;
start rounding up people. Some people resist,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:49.840
and the robots attack them. More NS-5s break into&nbsp;
the police station and start attacking the cops.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:52.880
The police fire back, but they’re quickly overrun.

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:57.360
Calvin tries to make her way out,&nbsp;
but her NS-5 urges her to stay put.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:03.120
Calvin commands it to shut down, but it’s&nbsp;
unresponsive. Spooner then comes to the rescue,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:08.640
shooting the NS-5 down. He takes Calvin,&nbsp;
and they head to URS. On the streets,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:12.480
people are forming up to fight the robot&nbsp;
threat. Spooner tells Calvin that the old&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:17.040
NS-4s were getting killed off because they&nbsp;
would have protected people from the NS-5s.

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:20.160
Calvin and Spooner reach the lower&nbsp;
levels, and Sonny lets them in.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:25.920
Calvin reveals that she switched Sonny out with a&nbsp;
different NS-5 during the decommissioning process.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:29.280
They then make their way up to Robertson’s&nbsp;
office only to discover him dead.

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:34.800
Spooner finally realizes who is behind&nbsp;
everything. It had been Viki. Lanning&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:39.760
discovered it but knew nobody would believe him.&nbsp;
He then killed himself, knowing Spooner would come&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:44.480
to investigate. Lanning knew that Spooner would&nbsp;
suspect a robot for the cause of Lanning’s death.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:48.720
Viki appears and tells them that the&nbsp;
robots are simply enacting the three laws.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:54.080
Viki says that robots are programmed to&nbsp;
protect humans, yet humans kill each other.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:58.960
Robots are tasked to save human life, yet humanity&nbsp;
keeps figuring out ways to destroy itself.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:04.320
Viki then concluded that in order to protect&nbsp;
humans, robots must take away humanity’s freedom.

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:08.960
Sonny then tells Viki that it&nbsp;
understands. Sonny takes Calvin,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:12.880
telling Viki they will be taken as&nbsp;
prisoners, but Sonny winks at Spooner.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:17.280
Spooner then opens fire at the NS-5s&nbsp;
surrounding them, and Sonny fires at them too.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:22.960
Spooner and Calvin run out, knowing they have to&nbsp;
kill Viki. Calvin orders Sonny to get the nanites&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:27.200
and to meet them at Viki’s central processing&nbsp;
core. Calvin and Spooner reach Viki’s core.

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:32.560
Sonny reaches the lab and fights a robot&nbsp;
guarding the nanites. Sonny throws the robot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:37.680
at the security field around the nanites, and&nbsp;
half of it is melted away. Sonny then realizes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:42.320
the reason for the denser alloy in its skeleton&nbsp;
and reaches into the nanite chamber without harm.

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:49.360
Outside, an army of NS-5s climbs up the building,&nbsp;
making their way into Viki’s core. The NS-5s burst&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:53.760
in, and Spooner shoots at them. Spooner and&nbsp;
Calvin fight their way through the horde of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:59.760
NS-5s but more of them keep coming. Robots destroy&nbsp;
the platform Calvin is standing on, and she hangs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:04.960
on for dear life. Sonny arrives ready to inject&nbsp;
the nanites into Viki, but Spooner orders Sonny&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:10.320
to save Calvin. Sonny has to decide whether to&nbsp;
proceed with the injection or to save Calvin.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:14.160
The injection is the more logical choice&nbsp;
as it would save countless more humans,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:19.040
but Sonny decides to save Calvin. Sonny&nbsp;
drops the nanites, and Spooner dives for it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:24.480
Spooner falls down Viki’s exterior, using his&nbsp;
robotic arm to slow himself down, reaching&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:30.640
Viki’s brain. Sonny successfully saves Calvin, and&nbsp;
Spooner injects Viki with the nanites. The nanites&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:35.520
immediately eat through Viki’s synapses, and the&nbsp;
NS-5s all revert to their original programming.

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:39.760
All robots are sent to the storage site&nbsp;
from Sonny’s dreams the following day.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:45.040
Spooner figures out that Lanning had commanded&nbsp;
Sonny to kill him. Lanning knew that his death,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:48.240
paired with Spooner’s prejudice,&nbsp;
would lead him to Sonny. Sonny then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:51.920
joins the rest of the NS-5s at the&nbsp;
storage site, standing atop a hill.
