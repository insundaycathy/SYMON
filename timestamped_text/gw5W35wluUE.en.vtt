Movies in Short here.

00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:07.810
Today, I will summarize the first season of
a 2021 Korean, Drama, Mystery TV-Series called

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:09.260
“Squid Game”.

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:13.320
The series explores the struggles of poor
people in debt who barely make ends meet and

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.320
the lines they are willing to cross to get
high amounts of money.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.930
Sit back, relax and enjoy!

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.840
Seong Gi-hun is down on his luck, having accumulated
enormous debts with loan sharks.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.610
At a train station, he is asked by a well-dressed
man to play a game of ddakji, similar to the

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:32.640
1990s game of Pogs, for money.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.679
The man gives Gi-hun a card, inviting him
to play games with higher stakes.

00:00:36.679 --> 00:00:42.810
Gi-hun accepts, is knocked unconscious, and
taken to a mysterious location with 455 other

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:47.839
players who awaken in a dormitory and are
identified by numbers on their tracksuits.

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:52.839
The location is managed by masked staff in
pink jumpsuits and overseen by the Front Man,

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:54.280
masked in black.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.420
The players are all in dire financial straits
and will be given billions of Won in prize

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.239
money if they win six games over six days.

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:07.409
Gi-hun befriends Player 001, an elderly man,
and recognizes among the players Cho Sang-woo,

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:13.320
a former classmate and businessman, and Player
067, a pickpocket who stole his money.

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.630
The first game is Red Light, Green Light,
a children’s game where one person commands

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.560
those behind them to run by saying “Green
Light” and hold still by saying “Red Light”.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.150
Anyone caught moving during a red light phase
loses the game.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.229
In this version of the game, however, those
who are caught don’t just lose... they are

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:31.229
killed on the spot.

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.890
Gi-hun is saved from falling by Player 199,
a Pakistani foreign worker, and is able to

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.310
complete the game.

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.189
More than half of the players are killed in
the first game, and a few horrified survivors

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:44.930
beg to leave.

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.960
According to the third clause of the game's
agreement, if the majority vote to end the

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.890
games, all players will be sent home, but
no money will be given.

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.149
The players vote, and Player 001's deciding
vote has all of them sent home safely.

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:03.250
Gi-hun goes to the police but no one believes
him except Detective Hwang Jun-ho, whose missing

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.679
brother received the same invitation card
as Gi-hun.

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:11.140
All players are given the chance to return
to the games and many do so due to desperation,

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.660
including Gi-hun, whose mother needs surgery;
Sang-woo, who is about to be arrested for

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:22.470
financial fraud; Player 001, who has terminal
brain cancer; Player 067, who wishes to exfiltrate

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.420
her parents from North Korea and get her little
brother out of the orphanage; Player 199,

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.260
who attacked and gravely wounded his boss
for withholding his wages for months; and

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:37.030
Player 101 (real name Jang Deok-Su), a gangster
on the run from gambling debts.

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.930
Jun-ho secretly follows Gi-hun when he is
picked up by the game staff.

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.810
Jun-ho successfully infiltrates the games
by taking out one of the masked workers and

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.120
using his identity as worker “Number 29”.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.150
It is revealed that the location of the games
is on a remote island.

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:59.350
That night, Player 067 asks to use the restroom
and sneaks through the vents to investigate.

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.490
She sees the masked workers making something
with large amounts of sugar.

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:07.450
The next morning, the players are now more
prepared and start forming alliances.

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:13.400
Gi-hun, Sang-woo, Player 001, and Player 199
team up.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.470
In the second game, the players are to pick
a stamped shape out of Dalgona, a popular

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.180
treat amongst kids that’s made in ladles
over small burners on the streets of many

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.650
Korean cities.

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.840
Sang-woo recognizes the game after learning
about it from Player 067, but doesn't warn

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.100
his teammates and tells everyone to pick different
shapes and then chooses the simplest shape

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.310
for himself.

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.910
Gi-hun ends up picking the most difficult
shape, an umbrella, but is able to complete

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.940
the game by licking the honeycomb to melt
it.

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:46.180
Player 212, a rowdy, mysterious, and manipulative
woman, helps Deok-Su complete the game with

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:47.420
a smuggled lighter.

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:53.040
A scared player takes a masked staff member
hostage and forces him to unmask himself.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.630
Shocked that the staff member is no older
than a college student, the player kills himself

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.430
and the staff member is killed for revealing
his identity.

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.980
Player 111, a doctor, secretly works with
a handful of staff to harvest organs from

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.990
dead players to sell on the black market in
return for information on upcoming games.

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:16.160
Gi-hun realizes that Sang-woo knew what the
Dalgona game was, but remained quiet.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.930
The staff foment discord among the players
to weed out the weak ones.

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:25.620
Deok-Su kills another player over food, which
results in the prize money being increased.

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.031
Player 111 asks to join Deok-Su’s group
after revealing that he has knowledge of the

00:04:30.031 --> 00:04:31.750
next game.

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.300
After lights out, a riot erupts and numerous
players are killed.

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:40.960
Player 067 joins Gi-hun's team, who protect
her from Deok-Su's gang.

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.750
When Player 001 begs everyone to stop, the
Front Man ends the riot.

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:52.630
Gi-hun's team exchange names to build trust:
Player 199 is Ali Abdul, and Player 067 is

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:54.280
Kang Sae-byeok.

00:04:54.280 --> 00:05:04.400
Player 001, who is suffering from a brain
tumor, has trouble remembering his name.

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:09.510
In the third game, players are told to form
groups of 10.

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:13.220
Sae-byeok recruits Player 240, a girl close
to her age.

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:18.100
Deok-Su, who learned from the doctor that
the upcoming game is tug of war, picks strong

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:23.970
men and rejects Player 212 (real name Han
Mi-nyeo), who joins Gi-hun's team.

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:28.230
Despite having weaker players, Gi-hun's team
is able to win their tug of war match with

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:32.200
Player 001 and Sang-woo's strategies and quick
thinking.

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:36.710
Anticipating another riot, they build a barricade
and spend the night taking turns on guard

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:39.710
but Deok-Su's team doesn't attack.

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:44.121
Jun-ho learns about the conspiracy with Player
111 for black market organ harvesting, as

00:05:44.121 --> 00:05:47.480
the staff member whose identity he stole was
part of it.

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:52.480
The Front Man catches them and executes everyone
involved in the conspiracy, including Player

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:53.940
111.

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:58.130
Their bodies are strung up for all players
to see and the players receive an apology,

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:02.680
as Player 111 had an unfair advantage and
the games pride themselves on treating everyone

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:06.030
as equals no matter their status in the outside
world.

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:11.400
Meanwhile, Jun-Ho’s identity has been compromised
by one of the organ dealers.

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:15.230
Jun-Ho confronts the man using his gun and
asks for information regarding his missing

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:16.550
brother.

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:21.900
He tells him that the man with the black mask
keeps all information of previous players.

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:24.710
Jun-Ho executes the man and leaves.

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:28.700
Some time later, The Front Man finds the dead
organ dealer with a bullet in the head and

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:33.230
he deduces that the bullet came from a Smith
and Wesson M60 revolver, which only the police

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:34.230
force use.

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:39.340
He begins a facility-wide manhunt for Jun-ho,
who later breaks into the Front Man's office

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:43.210
and learns that the game has been running
for over 30 years, and that his brother Hwang

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:46.430
In-ho was the winner in 2015.

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:49.460
For the fourth game, players are told to pair
up.

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:55.700
Sang-woo, who is close with Ali, picks him;
Gi-hun, who has a soft spot for Player 001,

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:59.350
chooses him; Player 240 picks Sae-byeok.

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:02.960
Expecting that they will be working with their
partner, the players are horrified to learn

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:06.840
that they will actually be playing against
their partner in a marble game of their choice,

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:11.070
and whoever gets all their partner's marbles
within 30 minutes will win and survive.

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:16.590
Sae-byeok and Player 240 (real name Ji Yeong)
talk about their lives, and Ji Yeong decides

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:19.130
that Sae-byeok has more to live for.

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:25.200
Ji Yeong intentionally loses in the marble
game and gets killed, leaving Sae-byeok devastated.

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:29.300
Sang-woo tricks Ali into giving up his marbles
and wins, though he is similarly distressed

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:30.750
when Ali dies.

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:36.600
Gi-hun, about to lose, turns the game around
by using Player 001's failing memory against

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:39.070
him, even though doing so unnerves him.

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:43.980
Player 001 reveals that he knew Gi-hun was
tricking him the whole time, but allows Gi-hun

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:47.389
to win anyway as Gi-hun is his GGanbu or trusted
friend.

00:07:47.389 --> 00:07:52.490
Before being killed, 001 remembers his name:
Oh Il-nam.

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:57.330
Gi-hun, Sang-woo, and Sae-byeok are traumatized
by the deaths of their partners.

00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:03.389
Player 069, who defeated his wife in the marble
game, is heartbroken and commits suicide.

00:08:03.389 --> 00:08:08.580
Foreign VIP guests arrive and are welcomed
by the Front Man on behalf of his boss, who

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:10.320
is the host.

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:14.490
The VIPs are wealthy patrons who gamble on
the games and watch them live.

00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:20.510
Jun-ho, now posing as one of the masked servants,
is sexually propositioned by a VIP.

00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:25.760
In a private room, he attacks the VIP and
interrogates him for info, recording the man's

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:29.710
confession about the games and everything
happening on the remote island, before escaping

00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:32.060
the island in scuba gear.

00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:34.939
The Front Man sees him and gives chase.

00:08:34.939 --> 00:08:39.339
In the fifth game, the players have 16 minutes
to cross a high bridge made of panels of either

00:08:39.339 --> 00:08:43.519
tempered glass or normal glass which cannot
support their weight.

00:08:43.519 --> 00:08:47.379
Most players at the front of the line fall
to their deaths as the panels are tested.

00:08:47.379 --> 00:08:52.209
When Deok-Su gets to the front, he refuses
to move, despite the clock ticking.

00:08:52.209 --> 00:08:58.310
Mi-nyeo grabs him and, as revenge for betraying
her, takes him down with her to their deaths.

00:08:58.310 --> 00:09:02.920
Sang-woo angrily pushes Player 017 when he
takes too long, killing him to reveal the

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:04.360
last trick panel.

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:09.990
Gi-hun, Sang-woo, and Sae-byeok are the only
three to complete the game.

00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:14.790
As finalists, Gi-hun, Sang-woo, and Sae-byeok
are given a change of clothes and a fancy

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:16.360
steak dinner.

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:20.610
It is revealed that Sae-byeok was badly wounded
in the previous game, having been stabbed

00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:24.959
by a piece of glass when the bridge shattered,
and is swiftly bleeding out.

00:09:24.959 --> 00:09:28.509
When dinner is cleared, each of them is left
with a knife.

00:09:28.509 --> 00:09:33.490
After lights out, Gi-hun, now realizing Sang-woo
will go to any length to win, plans to kill

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:38.029
Sang-woo in his sleep but Sae-byeok stops
him and tells him he is better than that.

00:09:38.029 --> 00:09:41.350
Gi-hun suggests they team up against Sang-woo.

00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:45.459
A weakened Sae-byeok instead makes Gi-hun
promise that whoever wins the game will look

00:09:45.459 --> 00:09:47.600
after the other's loved ones.

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:52.860
Sae-byeok's injuries worsen, prompting a desperate
Gi-hun to call for help, but she dies before

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:57.970
the staff arrive; it is revealed that Sang-woo
stabbed and killed her when Gi-hun was away.

00:09:57.970 --> 00:10:02.079
Furious and heartbroken, Gi-hun attempts to
attack Sang-woo, but the guards knock them

00:10:02.079 --> 00:10:03.959
both down.

00:10:03.959 --> 00:10:07.579
Jun-ho makes it to the other island but is
quickly tracked down by the Front Man and

00:10:07.579 --> 00:10:08.980
the staff.

00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:13.579
To Jun-ho's shock, the Front Man reveals himself
to be his brother, In-ho.

00:10:13.579 --> 00:10:18.800
He then shoots Jun-ho and lets him fall into
the sea, seemingly killing him.

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:21.929
The final game is the eponymous Squid game.

00:10:21.929 --> 00:10:25.930
After a long and brutal fight in the rain,
Gi-hun defeats Sang-woo but refuses to complete

00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:27.339
the game.

00:10:27.339 --> 00:10:31.660
He invokes the third clause to end the game
so that he and Sang-woo can leave alive, but

00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:35.639
Sang-woo kills himself after asking Gi-hun
to use the prize money to help Sang-woo's

00:10:35.639 --> 00:10:36.639
mother.

00:10:36.639 --> 00:10:41.379
Gi-hun, after suffering an emotional breakdown,
returns home to find that his own mother has

00:10:41.379 --> 00:10:42.899
passed away.

00:10:42.899 --> 00:10:47.410
A year later, Gi-hun is still traumatized
by his experience, which is why he has barely

00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:48.779
touched his prize money.

00:10:48.779 --> 00:10:55.589
One night, he receives a game invitation card;
to his shock, he finds Oh Il-nam (Player 001)

00:10:55.589 --> 00:10:57.260
still alive but sick and dying.

00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:01.920
Oh Il-nam is revealed to be the mastermind
behind the game, which he created to entertain

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:06.119
the bored ultra-rich like himself, trying
to find a way to derive enjoyment from life

00:11:06.119 --> 00:11:10.019
and testing whether humanity had any innate
goodness left in it.

00:11:10.019 --> 00:11:14.119
He reminds Gi-hun that the participants sacrificed
each other for the sake of earning the money

00:11:14.119 --> 00:11:15.860
for themselves.

00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:20.059
The specific games are based on Oh Il-nam's
childhood, and he had participated himself

00:11:20.059 --> 00:11:21.420
for nostalgia's sake.

00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:26.550
Oh Il-nam asks Gi-hun to play one last game
with him, another test to see if humanity

00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:28.370
has goodness left.

00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:32.220
He points at a homeless man on the street
and says that if nobody helps the man by the

00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:37.559
time the clock strikes midnight then he wins,
if somebody helps the man before then, Gi-hun

00:11:37.559 --> 00:11:38.559
wins.

00:11:38.559 --> 00:11:42.230
As the clock is about to reach midnight, a
woman in a police patrol car stops to help

00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:43.619
the homeless man.

00:11:43.619 --> 00:11:48.890
Gi-hun wins and Oh Il-nam dies, presumably
after witnessing his loss.

00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:54.259
Finally snapping out of his stupor, Gi-hun
fulfills his promises to Sae-byeok and Sang-woo.

00:11:54.259 --> 00:11:58.199
He is about to leave the country to reconnect
with his daughter in Los Angeles but sees

00:11:58.199 --> 00:12:02.129
someone playing ddakji with the same game
recruiter who invited him.

00:12:02.129 --> 00:12:06.019
He angrily snatches the man's card away and
tells him to stay away.

00:12:06.019 --> 00:12:11.130
Before boarding his plane, he calls the number
on the card and asks them who they are.

00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:14.259
The Front Man instead curtly orders him to
get on the plane.

00:12:14.259 --> 00:12:18.990
Gi-hun instead ends the call and stays in
Seoul, now fully determined to expose the

00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:21.589
people behind the games.

00:12:21.589 --> 00:12:22.589
Thanks for watching!
