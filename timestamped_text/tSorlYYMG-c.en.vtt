00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.680
Hi, Mystery Recapped here. Today, I’m&nbsp;
going to explain an American science&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:11.680
fiction comedy film called “Meet Dave.” 
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care!
&nbsp;

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:20.000
The movie begins with a small glowing object in&nbsp;
space heading towards earth. On its way to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.960
planet, it knocks into a satellite and enters&nbsp;
the atmosphere. In a New York City apartment,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.320
a young boy named Josh Morrison stares through&nbsp;
his telescope at the object falling from the sky.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.440
The golf-ball-sized metal ball flies through&nbsp;
Josh’s window and lands in his fishbowl. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.880
ball seemingly drains the water along with&nbsp;
the goldfish, as Josh watches in amazement.
&nbsp;

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.600
The movie then fast forwards to three months&nbsp;
in the future. A massive fireball makes its&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.400
way towards the earth, and crashes next to&nbsp;
the Statue of Liberty on Liberty Island.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:55.120
When the flames subside, the fireball is&nbsp;
revealed to be a man wearing a white suit.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.000
He walks awkwardly and takes a ferry back to&nbsp;
the city. The man navigates through the city,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.080
seemingly amused by humans. While crossing a road,&nbsp;
he gets knocked over by a car. The accident twists&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.400
his foot, but he quickly disappears before&nbsp;
the lady driver gets to call an ambulance.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:16.320
In a secluded corner, the man’s right ear opens&nbsp;
like a gate, and out comes a tiny humanoid alien.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.920
The tiny humanoid slides down a rope to the man’s&nbsp;
legs. He opens a tiny window in the man’s leg,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.880
revealing a bundle of malfunctioning wires. The&nbsp;
tiny humanoid then begins to repair the leg. 
&nbsp;

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.000
Another tiny humanoid notes the status of&nbsp;
the leg and returns to the brain of the man.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.240
It turns out the man is a spaceship&nbsp;
controlled by 100 tiny humanoid aliens.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.360
Its Captain pilots the spaceship from the&nbsp;
command deck located in its head, and humanoids&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.640
controlling one body part each send a report back&nbsp;
to the captain. The report reveals that the ship’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.360
impact shields were not activated because of the&nbsp;
unpredicted nature of the collision, but the ship&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:57.360
has survived. However, it will only be able to&nbsp;
run at full capacity for the next 48 earth hours.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.960
The ship’s tracking systems were also damaged.&nbsp;
The captain assembles the crew for a briefing. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.520
reveals that they came from a planet called Nil.&nbsp;
Their planet is on the verge of a catastrophic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.640
energy crisis and the ball-like device called Orb,&nbsp;
which they sent to the earth three months earlier,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:18.480
was lost. They are here to retrieve and deploy&nbsp;
it. Salt from earth could power planet Nil for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:24.160
ages. The aliens plan to use the Orb to take&nbsp;
Earth's salt by draining Earth's oceans. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:30.000
captain has second-in-command named Number 2 and&nbsp;
researcher named Number 3 as advisers by his side.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.240
The spaceship looks like a human, but the&nbsp;
aliens don't know how to make the "ship"&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.560
act like a normal human. They use&nbsp;
Google and Yahoo to learn about humans.
&nbsp;

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.560
Meanwhile, the cops are alerted&nbsp;
about the mysterious fireball.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.680
A superstitious officer named Dooley and his&nbsp;
partner begin investigating the matter. They&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.680
learn from the impression of the man's face in&nbsp;
the dirt on the crash site what he looks like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.560
and orders his search throughout the city.
Elsewhere, Josh notices the human spaceship&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.280
from his window and alerts his mother Gina, who&nbsp;
is the same female driver that knocked it over.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:07.600
Gina rushes downstairs and apologizes to the human&nbsp;
ship. The aliens slightly panic over their first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.160
verbal encounter with a human. Captain attempts&nbsp;
to talk through the ship, but ends up speaking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:17.840
in an extremely high frequency, breaking glasses&nbsp;
nearby. After adjusting the bass and frequency,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.800
the captain manages to respond that he is&nbsp;
okay. Gina sends Josh to school and invites the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:28.720
human spaceship to her home. Captain introduces&nbsp;
himself as Dave Ming Chang, based on a quick scan&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.440
of common Earth names. The crew notices their&nbsp;
missing ball in a photograph in Gina's home.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:39.120
Gina reveals the image is from Josh’s school when&nbsp;
Josh took part in a Science fair. It turns out,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:46.080
Josh presented the Orb as his science project. The&nbsp;
crew quickly locate Josh at 729 East 44th Street&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.960
and Dave excuses himself and proceeds to&nbsp;
leave. However, he mistakes the closet for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.960
the door. He then awkwardly steps out of&nbsp;
the closet and leaves through the door. 
&nbsp;

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:59.760
As Dave walks his way through the city to Josh’s&nbsp;
school, Number 2 gets increasingly agitated by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:05.360
humans' disregard for rule and order. Captain&nbsp;
asks an onboard doctor to keep an eye on Number 2&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.920
due to his increasing eccentricity. Dave&nbsp;
passes through a children's park and kids&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:15.200
mistake him for an ice-cream man so Dave changes&nbsp;
his clothes. To pay for the new clothes, he scans&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:20.240
money and literally prints it out from his arse.
Dave finally arrives at the school looking for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:25.040
Josh’s class. The school principal mistakes him&nbsp;
for a substitute teacher and sends him to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:30.080
class. While teaching, Dave takes Josh outside&nbsp;
the classroom and talks to him about the Orb.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.440
Josh tells him that the ball was&nbsp;
taken from him by his bully, Rich,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:38.480
who will be at a street fair tomorrow. The Captain&nbsp;
decides to go to the fair with Josh the next day&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:42.800
and they then return to Josh's home.
As they spend more time with each other, Josh&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:48.240
grows to like Dave. He is amazed by Dave's video&nbsp;
game-playing abilities. When Gina arrives home,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.960
she asks Dave if he would like to stay for supper.&nbsp;
Number 4 reminds the captain that the longer they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.920
stay in their presence, the greater the danger&nbsp;
of exposure, but the captain decides to stay. 
&nbsp;

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:02.400
After the supper, Dave asks Gina about the&nbsp;
painting on the wall. She reveals she drew&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:08.000
the painting while she was in love and it depicts&nbsp;
passionate love . Dave is intrigued and confused.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:13.120
He asks how do you know when you feel love. Gina&nbsp;
responds that when you feel love, you don’t need&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:18.240
to ask that question. Dave is still not sure&nbsp;
but excuses himself to leave for the night.
&nbsp;

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.000
Dave decides to spend the night on a&nbsp;
homeless man’s spot. The homeless man&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.360
offers Dave his blanket to keep him warm. Dave is&nbsp;
pleasantly puzzled by the man’s act of kindness.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:32.560
The aliens realize that humans are more advanced&nbsp;
than they originally thought. As the ship retires&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.960
for the night, the doctor reveals that an atypical&nbsp;
behavior is spreading throughout the ship.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:41.680
The captain finds Number 3 working late into&nbsp;
the night. She reveals that she has discovered&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:46.880
an interesting file in the alien database that&nbsp;
every human is forced to watch once a year. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:51.840
file is an iconic American Christmas movie. In&nbsp;
the movie, the hero offers to lasso the moon&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:57.280
for his love interest. The captain and number 3&nbsp;
find themselves sobbing after watching the movie.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:02.480
They feel drawn towards each other, but suppress&nbsp;
their urges and go to bed. The next day, with only&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:08.080
20% power left and police looking for him, Dave&nbsp;
goes to the fair with Josh to retrieve the Orb. 
&nbsp;

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:11.920
Dave participates in a hot dog eating&nbsp;
contest and wins it. He receives a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:17.520
soft toy as a prize and gifts it to Gina.&nbsp;
Gina is elated to receive the soft toy. 
&nbsp;

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:23.520
Dave later finds Rich bullying Josh. He lifts the&nbsp;
bully upside down, as Josh is elated to see Rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:28.800
learn a lesson. After Dave retrieves the ball, he&nbsp;
offers to take Gina and Josh to a restaurant to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:33.520
celebrate Gina's birthday. Number 2 protests&nbsp;
and suggests they start deploying the ball&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:38.080
instead. However, the captain argues that Gina&nbsp;
and Josh have helped them retrieve the ball,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:42.320
so it's only fair that they return their favor.&nbsp;
Number 2 storms out of the control room in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:47.520
protest as Dave takes Gina and Josh to a salsa&nbsp;
restaurant where they have an amazing time. 
&nbsp;

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:51.440
Meanwhile, the police have located Dave,&nbsp;
and are on their way to apprehend him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:55.600
After spending so much time on Earth, most&nbsp;
of the crew begin to exhibit new "feelings",&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:59.840
adopting Earth's culture, mannerisms,&nbsp;
and general laid-back attitude.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:05.200
Number 3 learns that Number 4 has turned his whole&nbsp;
room into a dance club. Number 3 then also changes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:09.920
into a salsa dress and goes to the control room to&nbsp;
ask the captain to dance with her, but Gina asks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:16.560
him to dance before her. Number 3, hurt, leaves.
As they dance, the police arrive and apprehend&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:22.320
Dave for questioning. Josh and Gina are puzzled by&nbsp;
the arrest. As officer Dooley interrogates Dave,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:25.760
Number 2 decides that the Captain and&nbsp;
the rest of the crew's changing behavior&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:31.520
is unacceptable and gathers an army of aliens for&nbsp;
a coup d'etat. Captain, enraged, orders the crew&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:36.800
to not comply with Number 2. However, realizing&nbsp;
they are short on time to rescue their planet Nil,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:41.600
the crew, including number 3, oblige with&nbsp;
the new captain. The two cops overhear the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:46.640
conversation inside Dave's control room because&nbsp;
of an open speaker. Officer Dooley's suspicion&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:51.120
of Dave being an alien solidifies and the&nbsp;
two cops leave the interrogation room.
&nbsp;

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:56.560
Number 2 then announces that under his leadership,&nbsp;
a new era has begun and un-Nil-ian behavior will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:01.840
be punished. Dave, the spaceship, then storms out&nbsp;
of the confinement, blasting through the wall.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:06.160
Police officers spray Dave with bullets,&nbsp;
but it barely has any impact on him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:11.600
Seeing the number 2 get out of control, Number&nbsp;
17, a young, fun-loving drunk alien, jumps out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:17.440
of the "ship" to save himself from his fury. On&nbsp;
Dave's way out, number 2 notices Josh and Gina.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:21.680
He berates them for wasting his time with&nbsp;
their emotional pathetic distractions. 
&nbsp;

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:26.080
Finally, he tells Gina that her artwork&nbsp;
is pretentious before leaving. Number 2's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:31.200
craziness worries number 3 and she sneaks back&nbsp;
into the alien quarters and frees the captain.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:35.680
However, number 2 soon catches up to them&nbsp;
and sneezes them out of the Spaceship.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:41.120
As the tiny aliens attempt to avoid being trampled&nbsp;
on by humans and peed on by dogs, Number 3 lets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:45.840
the captain know her displeasure over him choosing&nbsp;
to dance with Gina over her. The two then use a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:51.600
plastic bag as a hot air balloon to fly towards&nbsp;
the spaceship. However, the plastic bag gets stuck&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:56.480
in a bus's windscreen wiper. They then use the&nbsp;
wiper as a launcher to propel themselves on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:56.480 --> 00:09:01.760
spaceship and land on Dave's shoe. The captain&nbsp;
then apologizes to Number 3, telling her that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:06.880
he chose her to accompany him on this mission,&nbsp;
because of her giant heart and kindness. Without&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:11.200
her, he would be nothing. She then asks him&nbsp;
why he never spoke to her like this and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:16.160
captain responds that he was too Nil-ian to ever&nbsp;
express it. He expresses regret that he should&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:21.840
have "lassoed the moon" for her a long time ago.&nbsp;
The duo then makes their way back into the ship.
&nbsp;

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:27.040
Meanwhile, Dave takes a cab to save his energy&nbsp;
to Liberty Island. Josh refuses to believe that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:32.240
it is Dave who is doing these evil things, and&nbsp;
convinces his mom to follow Dave and help him. 
&nbsp;

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:36.880
Back at the police station, Dooley discovers&nbsp;
Number 17 in his coffee and interrogates&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:40.880
him to find out where Dave is going.
At the Liberty Island harbor, as number 2&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:45.360
proceeds to throw the orb into the water to&nbsp;
drain the earth of all its water and salt,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:50.400
Captain overrides his command and stops him.&nbsp;
Number 2 is enraged and orders the crew to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:55.040
apprehend the captain along with the number 3.&nbsp;
However, the captain tells the rest of the crew&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:55.040 --> 00:10:00.160
that the real Captain is in charge again. Wary&nbsp;
of Number 2's unpredictable and eccentric nature,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:05.360
the crew accept the captain as their leader. 
Reinstated, he orders Number 2 to be stuck in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:11.200
the ship's "butt" forever. The metal orb meanwhile&nbsp;
slips out of Dave's hand and rolls into the ocean.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:16.640
The siphoning process starts and the orb begins to&nbsp;
drain the ocean. The Captain attempts to retrieve&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:21.200
the orb but is told that they only have enough&nbsp;
power left to either retrieve the ball or return&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:26.080
home. The captain makes a decision to save&nbsp;
the earth and asks the crew's permission.
&nbsp;

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:31.600
They all agree and Dave reroutes all its energy&nbsp;
to stop the siphoning process. After retrieving&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:36.320
the ball, Dave powers down while Dooley and his&nbsp;
partner catch up and point their guns at him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:41.920
Josh grabs Dooley's taser which he uses on Dave,&nbsp;
recharging him. After David gets fully recharged,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:47.440
The Captain and Number 3 reveal themselves to the&nbsp;
police officers who stand down. The Captain says&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:53.120
goodbye to Josh and Gina saying he now understands&nbsp;
love. The captain resolves to find other sources&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:58.560
of energy on other planets instead of destroying&nbsp;
the earth. Number 17 is then returned to Dave&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:04.880
by Dooley. As Dave proceeds to fly back to his&nbsp;
planet, the FBI arrives and traps Dave in a net.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:09.520
While the FBI agents wrestle the body down,&nbsp;
"Dave's" crew evacuates to one of the ship's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:15.040
"lifeboat" shoes, activates the engines, detaches&nbsp;
the shoe, and heads home to Nil, leaving behind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:20.960
both the ship and Number 2. While in the lifeboat,&nbsp;
the Captain asks for Number 3's hand in marriage.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:26.320
The movie ends as she accepts and they kiss.
