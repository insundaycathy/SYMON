00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.960
This is Ely from binge express and today we&nbsp;
follow a bunch of college students on their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.840
way to a nature cabin in the woods we will&nbsp;
witness an attack of a zombified family the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.920
Buckners and attempt to beat them as&nbsp;
always in exciting and creative ways

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.320
let's start off with the red flags&nbsp;
because once we arrive at the lodge&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.600
there are multiple of those that we should talk&nbsp;
about first of all Holden detects a one-way mirror&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:31.200
in his room connecting his with Dana's which&nbsp;
is definitely a weird feature in a wood cabin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.680
we all know what one way mirrors&nbsp;
are but how do they work exactly

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.880
well mirrors like these typically only&nbsp;
appear reflective in brightly lit rooms&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:46.080
but actually light passes through each side&nbsp;
equally however only those standing in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.720
darker lit room are able to look through it&nbsp;
because the reflected light of the brightly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.840
lit room is pretty much overwhelming the&nbsp;
light shining through from the dark side&nbsp;

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.600
and therefore while the mirror looks&nbsp;
perfectly normal in the bright room&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.760
from the perspective of the person standing&nbsp;
in the darker room the mirror looks more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.720
like a shaded window in case you wonder&nbsp;
where such mirrors are typically found&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:14.880
look no further than interrogation rooms of course&nbsp;
execution chambers and interestingly enough even&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:21.040
teleprompters where text is projected onto glass&nbsp;
directly in front of a film or television camera&nbsp;

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.480
Now discovering something like this would&nbsp;
definitely make me go through the house thoroughly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:31.680
to see what else there is that isn't part of the&nbsp;
standard interior i mean it's just kind of weird&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.920
sometimes being overly paranoid can be actually&nbsp;
helpful who knew to do that as effectively as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.440
possible team up in groups of two and search&nbsp;
one room at a time by doing that chances are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.400
you will find more weird features and conclude&nbsp;
that something must be wrong with this cabin

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.040
"what the hell was that"

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.520
I mean i think the obvious big downside at this&nbsp;
point or once you have arrived at the cabin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.400
is that you are constantly being watched and&nbsp;
controlled by the underground surveillance team&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:07.280
that we will talk about later at this point&nbsp;
though none of our characters knew about the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.560
scheme they are trapped in and well even the&nbsp;
mirror from before doesn't automatically make&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.960
you figure that out for that you must&nbsp;
either find conclusive evidence like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:22.080
actual cameras or you recite an incantation&nbsp;
that revives the Buckners as zombies while&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.520
one of your friends plays with the&nbsp;
apple of eden antichrist edition

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.600
So as Dana unknowingly revives the Buckners&nbsp;
as zombies there are a few scenes where our&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:37.200
characters didn't leverage their potential the&nbsp;
first encounter happens when Curt and Jules are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.560
getting it on outdoor Marvin Gaye would be proud

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.520
geez that hand-pin though that was pretty&nbsp;
neat however the screaming from jewels&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.400
and the punches from Curt aren't helpful&nbsp;
whatsoever you're clearly facing zombies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.520
sure you may be under shock I can understand&nbsp;
that but Curt seemed to be quite in control&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.400
here there were several options he had&nbsp;
to get Jules out of the situation alive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:08.080
first of all we are in a forest and that means&nbsp;
the floor is uneven and potentially wet and it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:13.920
seemed like they weren't far off the lodge neither&nbsp;
my best guess would be around 3 minutes of walking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:19.120
distance which makes it easy reachable in&nbsp;
under a minute when running at full speed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.480
although you might want to adjust your velocity&nbsp;
in relation to the woodiness of the environment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:30.480
the last thing you want is a trip and fall and&nbsp;
perhaps even fracture a bone in this situation&nbsp;

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:36.480
The Buckners also didn't seem to have anything in&nbsp;
common with the zombies of world war z or train to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:42.000
Busan i mean those would have been impossible&nbsp;
to escape from but in our case here these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.600
zombies look more like the slow and bulky types&nbsp;
which is definitely a big advantage to consider&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:53.200
however there were three of them and all of them&nbsp;
were armed they were also capable of teamwork as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:59.440
we can see and so our two unarmed characters&nbsp;
have only little chance to take them head on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:04.880
the single best option is run daddy Buckner&nbsp;
though seems to have a bear trap flail which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:10.880
is a pretty cool thing however it also has quite&nbsp;
a long range so you have to keep this in mind when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:16.960
running away from him particularly Jules does the&nbsp;
exact opposite she mindlessly runs towards curt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:22.080
facing dad Buckner with her back which was&nbsp;
obviously a dumb move she had to pay for in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:28.240
end but you don't have to okay so if you use the&nbsp;
trees to cover he won't be able to snatch you from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:34.240
behind basically the best thing would be running&nbsp;
in slalom around the trees towards the lodge&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:39.440
this way it gives you pretty high chance to&nbsp;
escape and survive the attack successfully&nbsp;

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:44.400
additionally keep in mind that two other&nbsp;
zombies used lengthy albeit close range&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:50.240
knives which are technically less powerful&nbsp;
than the long range flail from daddy Buckner&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:55.840
you would do well to remember these facts as&nbsp;
it will only add to your future combat strategy&nbsp;

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.000
back at the lodge Curt alarms the other&nbsp;
characters and comes up with a pretty&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.400
intelligent plan to avoid the impending threat&nbsp;
he tells the others this "lock down the cabin"&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:14.240
"stay together" and "play safe" it's pretty good&nbsp;
however i would additionally add "arm yourself"&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:18.960
and attack and defend in teams
You see i think we can all agree&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:23.840
that zombies are some of the most difficult&nbsp;
things to kill and often even impossible&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:28.960
if you encounter the immortal ones then you&nbsp;
should always aim at chopping off their heads&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:33.680
arms or legs to cripple them and&nbsp;
lower their ability to threaten you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:38.080
the easiest way this can be attained is&nbsp;
obviously through teamwork and mid-range&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:44.320
weapons like large knives, katanas my personal&nbsp;
favorite and bayonets an additional benefit of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:50.320
using weapons like these is their stealth bonus
I mean let's be honest guys the cringe is real&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:55.840
when you see a character firing a double barrel&nbsp;
shotgun at the slow zombie in an open field

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:01.360
Since we have a fireplace in the lodge burning the&nbsp;
zombies might be a tempting idea i can understand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:07.360
but you should always look for an alternative&nbsp;
because the only thing worse than a zombie is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:12.880
a burning one since zombies don't feel pain and&nbsp;
won't lose consciousness due to carbon monoxide&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:18.160
poisoning a fire wouldn't really cause them&nbsp;
much harm until the body eventually falls apart&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:24.400
and turns into ashes however that takes quite&nbsp;
a lot of time basically a cremation process can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:30.880
take up to three hours and that is in a narrow&nbsp;
heat proof chamber with consistent fire intensity&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:38.800
of 800 degrees celsius or 1470 degrees fahrenheit&nbsp;
for comparison the average household fire burns&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:45.040
only at around 600 degrees celsius or 1100&nbsp;
degrees fahrenheit meaning a burning zombie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:51.920
in an open space would take a very very long time&nbsp;
to finally decay bad idea keep this in mind guys&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:57.120
however if you insist on burning a zombie&nbsp;
i can totally understand however then you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:02.880
might as well use a propane torch or elon musk's&nbsp;
flame thrower i'll link them in the description&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:08.560
now unfortunately in the movie the characters&nbsp;
decide to split up regardless and so each one gets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:14.160
locked up into their individual room suboptimal&nbsp;
but you know let's roll with it Owen Wilson&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:20.320
hold up no i mean Marty of course gets attacked&nbsp;
by one of the knife wielding zombies from before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:25.120
it goes without saying that turning your back&nbsp;
to the window while being threatened by zombies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:30.560
is probably the dumbest thing you could possibly&nbsp;
do even when believing you are in a reality tv&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:35.760
show surprisingly when the zombie snatched&nbsp;
Marty he didn't try to bite him by the way&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:40.160
meaning we can conclude that you won't&nbsp;
be zombified if you are getting bitten&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:46.240
scratched or covered in zombie fluids
still to be sure we should avoid any unnecessary&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:52.240
contact altogether the advantage here was clearly&nbsp;
the one-on-one combat and the mid-range baseball&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:58.160
coffee mug bong from Marty even if that weapon&nbsp;
wouldn't allow him to seriously injure the zombie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:03.360
it could definitely be used to keep the zombie&nbsp;
at the distance for some extra time he decides&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:09.680
to run though which i generally consent to but&nbsp;
he lacked appropriate preparation for an escape&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:14.800
what i mean is since he wore a shirt it would&nbsp;
have been smart and probably easily possible&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:20.240
to take it off and throw it over the head of the&nbsp;
zombie while that may not cause eternal confusion&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:25.360
to the zombie it can definitely help to make&nbsp;
a successful escape without being taken out by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:30.960
a throwing knife once you have gotten out of the&nbsp;
situation congratulations then you want to rejoin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:36.960
your friends as soon as possible because everybody&nbsp;
knows hunting zombies is a team sport meanwhile&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:42.160
Dana and Holden find a way to reconnect by&nbsp;
breaking the one-way mirror from before which was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:48.160
an obvious but nevertheless smart move underneath&nbsp;
the bed they find another trap door leading into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:54.400
an underground chamber now for starters i wouldn't&nbsp;
be so careless in deciding that it's empty i mean&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:59.680
you're fighting zombies here in the very least arm&nbsp;
yourself with anything before hopping down just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:05.520
in case using the lamp to glimpse into the dark&nbsp;
room was clever though down there our characters&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:11.120
explore the chamber very casually they look like&nbsp;
me looking for the milk at Tesco i mean you can't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:16.560
underestimate angry crowds at supermarkets but&nbsp;
it isn't comparable to a zombie threat in tight&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:22.480
environment therefore lowering your guard is a big&nbsp;
no and the first thing you should have done since&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:28.240
you have entered that underground room is to grab&nbsp;
any of the weapons on the table preferably a long&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:34.640
range weapon like i mentioned many times before&nbsp;
and keep your guard up now even if the weapon you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:40.400
choose won't be of any help and i will explain why&nbsp;
you still want to be as effective as possible in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:46.000
both defending and attacking anything is better&nbsp;
than your bare hands especially when fighting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:53.360
zombies so why wouldn't any of the weapons on the&nbsp;
table be of any help well when dana saves holden&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:58.960
from the zombie attack she grabs a knife from the&nbsp;
table and stabs the zombie countless times right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:04.160
afterwards though we see one of the controllers&nbsp;
activates a switch that causes the knife in dana's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:10.320
hand to emit electricity which most likely caused&nbsp;
the muscles in her hand to contract and ultimately&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:15.840
made her drop the knife she doesn't seem to notice&nbsp;
though probably because of the adrenaline rushing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:21.600
through her body which as everybody of you knows&nbsp;
dampens any physical sensation by significant&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:28.240
margin this small detail lets us conclude that&nbsp;
all the weapons on the table are probably rigged&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:33.680
and therefore close to useless however when she's&nbsp;
somehow successfully immobilized steady Buckner&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:39.200
with the knife by the way good for her they&nbsp;
would have done well to grab his bear trap flail&nbsp;

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:44.080
as we have seen this weapon seems to be the&nbsp;
most terrifying use by any of the Buckner family&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:50.640
members so to gain this weapon means to gain the&nbsp;
upper hand here also chances are pretty good that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:56.320
this weapon isn't rigged in any way at the very&nbsp;
very least they should have taken the chains&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:56.320 --> 00:11:01.600
hanging from the ceiling strong chains like these&nbsp;
make excellent ranged weaponry as well as great&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:07.600
tools for immobilizing large strong enemies i&nbsp;
mean look at the guy here the perfect tool in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:13.680
our situation so as they escaped the cabin and&nbsp;
ran to the camper and just like that stormed in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:19.120
i i kind of lost it for a second right there&nbsp;
casually entering this unlocked vehicle amidst&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:24.560
a zombie attack like me stumbling into my&nbsp;
toilet at 2am is kind of risky business i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:29.360
mean you're escaping zombies and not groupies&nbsp;
not that it's worse but i'm just saying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:34.800
while to get to the camper and drive out of the&nbsp;
area is a logical assessment and probably the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:40.000
best way to go here it is also true that none&nbsp;
of the Buckner zombies were quick in movement&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.200
which gives me the impression that our characters&nbsp;
could have afforded a quick break to analyze their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:51.840
situation here in any way storming into a large&nbsp;
unlocked vehicle with comparably vast space where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:58.400
someone or thing could hide is never a good idea&nbsp;
i mean even if you're fleeing from running zombies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:03.120
and have no time to inspect the hideout of your&nbsp;
choice you should at least remain cautious when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:09.200
moving forward deciding quickly and thoughtlessly&nbsp;
in risky situations often leads those to fail and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:17.680
well in this case even death gotta stay calm yep&nbsp;
that's that's exactly what i'm talking about but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:25.760
you know what before we continue let's go back a&nbsp;
little to see what happens to Curt well um i guess&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:32.960
that didn't turn out well either did it but i give&nbsp;
it an A for the effort and the B+ for originality&nbsp;

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:38.480
now if you are surrounded by an invincible force&nbsp;
field well that's that's pretty shitty not gonna&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:44.000
lie about that it's virtually impossible to escape&nbsp;
not that we've already invented this technology&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:49.520
but it does seem like the field into which Curt&nbsp;
crashes resembles nanotube technology and that is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:55.600
a real thing just not very sophisticated yet i'm&nbsp;
not going into full details here because first of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:55.600 --> 00:13:00.480
all i would get probably most of it wrong and&nbsp;
secondly it would take a while but basically&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:06.320
nanotubes are a thousand times stronger than&nbsp;
conventional steel but just about one atom thick&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:12.160
pretty thin i know anyway since the controller is&nbsp;
locked down a tunnel through which our characters&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:17.440
have first arrived we can assume that the force&nbsp;
field is not omni present and therefore can be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:23.280
overcome by digging a tunnel underneath it the&nbsp;
only problem is that's pretty much impossible&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:29.040
for our characters here i mean have a look at the&nbsp;
ground that looks like some solid ass-rock and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:34.960
while i'm no geologist it somewhat occurs to me&nbsp;
that the type of rock looks pretty dense without&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:40.320
sharp tools like giant picks forget digging any&nbsp;
kind of tunnel here even if you had a bunch of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:45.920
kids digging for you but fast forward to when&nbsp;
Dana crashes into the lake with the vehicle in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:51.680
that situation forget about the zombie passenger&nbsp;
the biggest threat here is the sinking and rapidly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:56.480
with water filling camper believe me when i&nbsp;
say this is not a joke you need to get out of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:56.480 --> 00:14:02.320
there as soon as you can no standard vehicles are&nbsp;
airtight meaning this would be a great opportunity&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:08.160
to test out the hyperventilation technique&nbsp;
i explained in our last video now the main&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:14.000
problem with the vehicle underwater is the immense&nbsp;
water load pressing against the doors forget being&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:19.360
able to open any of these your best and pretty&nbsp;
much only chance is to break one of the windows&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:24.880
through which you can fit dana however casually&nbsp;
opens the hatch which is definitely not possible&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:30.160
in real life to escape those circumstances you&nbsp;
need a car safety hammer somewhere in reach&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:35.440
even with fastened seat belts perhaps a knife is&nbsp;
a good choice as well for when you need to cut&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:41.280
through the seat belts first dana survives and&nbsp;
gets back up that poor girl obviously in agony&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:47.040
and despair she seemingly and understandably is&nbsp;
ready to give up just when our favorite bear trap&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:53.040
flail swinging zombie undertaker/Michael&nbsp;
Meyers hybrid appears and attacks at this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:58.160
point i was pretty emotionally invested
as Marty saves her and they finally reunite&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:02.720
after exchanging the latest news about&nbsp;
their lives "what have you been up to"&nbsp;

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:07.520
they go underground to face their&nbsp;
punishers in a pretty epic final combat

00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:11.760
Now i know what you want to see people the&nbsp;
monsters in the cabin in the woods were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:17.520
pretty darn awesome i mean look at this dude right&nbsp;
here i wish we could have seen him more in action&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:20.720
looking at the blades in his&nbsp;
head and the puzzle in his hand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:27.280
he is definitely inspired by the Cenobites of&nbsp;
Hellraiser the 1987 flick which to me at least&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:32.000
are some of the coolest monsters in terms&nbsp;
of background story then we got the angry&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.400
molesting tree and that i would like to&nbsp;
say that i wanted to see him in action too&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:42.560
i'm not sure what it says about me well in any way&nbsp;
whoever came up with this character or whatever&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:47.840
you want to call it has a pretty wild imagination&nbsp;
not sure if i ever want to meet this dude&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:52.640
and while i would love to go on about the monster&nbsp;
references in this flick we have to get dana and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:57.760
Marty out of there first technically they did&nbsp;
an amazing job down there releasing all the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:02.960
monsters and have them perched the whole place&nbsp;
was risky but nevertheless the only option with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:07.920
an at least possible successful outcome it&nbsp;
surprises me that those in charge down there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:13.360
don't run an emergency protocol if all monsters&nbsp;
should be released i mean for some reason they do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:18.880
have those completely useless yet heavily armed&nbsp;
special forces right i could imagine something&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:24.640
like an abandoned strategy if the place should be&nbsp;
overrun by all the monsters like in our case here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:29.120
there should be a way out for all the nine to&nbsp;
five workers down there i mean let's be honest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:33.920
here guys would you work for this organization&nbsp;
without an emergency protocol and have the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:39.360
endurance cover plan i don't think so if i were&nbsp;
in charge of this facility this is what i would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:44.400
have prepared first i would have hidden explosives&nbsp;
at key points throughout the facility just like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:49.920
Switzerland did during the cold war to seal off&nbsp;
the whole nation of its neighbors if necessary&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:55.520
pretty intense but i guess survival is key
secondly i have an emergency escape route for all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:55.520 --> 00:17:00.800
the employees that could be destroyed afterwards&nbsp;
after everyone has left that way everyone could&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:06.800
survive and the monsters would be trapped down&nbsp;
there even if just temporarily and lastly purge&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:13.040
the place of all remaining monsters that can&nbsp;
be killed perhaps acid rain, water flooding or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:18.960
an artificial napalm inferno could be taken into&nbsp;
consideration if you have better ideas let me know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:24.800
them please but anyway let's go back to dana and&nbsp;
Marty first after they run out of the control room&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:29.760
to escape the monster bat they stumble around&nbsp;
the facility not really knowing where to go&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:34.960
if it was me i would have decided to take the&nbsp;
elevator up again because i would prefer some slow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:40.160
bulky zombies like the Buckners instead of the&nbsp;
horror that is lurking in every corner down there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:44.640
back up you can at least enjoy your last&nbsp;
breaths at the idyllic lakeside shore&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:49.040
with decent moonlight and a decadent herby&nbsp;
cigarette all the while spending the last&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:54.640
minutes of the world in companionship of your&nbsp;
child's best friend it's pretty good um well yeah&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:54.640 --> 00:18:00.400
the ancient ones that's that's a good question&nbsp;
people if you wonder how to beat them i guess i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:11.120
guess this is the best solution with that thanks&nbsp;
for watching and i see you guys in the next one
