00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.560
Welcome to Cinema Summary, Ladies and Gentlemen.

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.460
Today we’re discussing a Spanish film called "El Hoyo",

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.490
or "The Platform" as it’s known in English:
A dystopian science fiction-fantasy-ish film about

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.260
humanity, desperation, and what happens in
a worse case scenario.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.980
Now just a heads up, I’ll be going through
a summary of the film’s events.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.330
So that means spoilers ahead, before going
on at length about the film: it’s themes,

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.769
the message, the ideas it discusses and how
you should go about watching this film because

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:30.810
it’s not like most films.

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.120
But with at out of the way!

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:35.570
This is The Platform explained.

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.360
So first thing we see is that of a fancy pants
kitchen where this food inspector guy goes

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.630
about inspecting the kitchen, looking over
prepared dishes and finding it to his liking.

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:50.930
It’s after this that we meet this guy played
by Ivan Massague, named Goreng in this very

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.870
spacious cell block with a rectangular hole
in the ceiling and the floor.

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.700
And as you can see, it gives you a very clear view
of everyone above you and below you.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:05.940
But Goreng's not alone, there’s this older
gentleman named Trimagasi played by Zorion...

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.540
Eguileor.

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.380
Who is a bit stand offish, not very
friendly, and uh... kind of a prick.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.520
Let's be honest.
So we got

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.660
2 strangers in a room together and
they just talk about this place

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:21.920
because ladies and gentlemen, is The Pit, an
underground prison complex with cells that

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.799
are 6 meters tall, the building itself stretching
deep beneath the earth and no one’s really

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:29.780
sure how far it goes down there.

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.549
But what the prisoners do know is
that there are rules here.

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.719
Rule 1: Any prisoner who enters can come in
with a single thing from the outside, Goreng

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:42.789
himself has a copy of Don Quixote to pass
the time and finally getting to read it while

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:45.780
Trimagasi has a self-sharpening knife.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.500
Oh yeah and rule #3: Every month,
the prisoners are gassed unconscious

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.060
so that they may be moved to a different
level and in turn a new cell mate.

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.359
And finally Rule #2: You’re not allowed
to take any food off the platform lest you

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.240
be burned or frozen to death.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.259
You see in this complex, there’s this magically
rising and falling platform that’s stocked

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:09.240
with the food prepped in the kitchen as we
saw in the beginning of the film.

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.560
With the upper levels, starting from 
Level 0--With Level 0 being the kitchen

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.580
getting the first pick and descending from  there on

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.700
And since there are a lot of levels and only
this much food in this prison, food is

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:23.629
like dark humor: Not everyone gets it.

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:28.959
So the lower the prison goes, the less food 
there is for everyone else and because of this

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:32.129
people go a little mad sometimes.

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:36.930
Now mind you there’s this process to enter
the prison voluntarily as people like Goreng,

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:42.909
crazily enough, want to get into the prison
as they can get some social mobility points,

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:47.360
not the exact wording used in the film but
think social credit or certification

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.780
as Goreng himself enters as he
himself wants to quit smoking

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.540
which is just crazy

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.140
But anyway back to the platform, the food
is there in each room, or each level I should say

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.300
for 2 minutes before the platforms descends again

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.379
and of course people get a little
angry with this whole deal.

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:07.660
And you’re anything like Trimagasi,
you’ll spit in it or do much worse,

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.260
which doesn’t make him any friends

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:10.420
with the people down below.

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.830
It’s like the most miserable battle royale
game but instead of trying to kill

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:19.360
people, you’re just trying to just survive
although killing people isn't off the menu

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.650
**wink wink**

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:26.079
Now since Goreng and Trimagasi are on the 48th
floor, the food is not at all hygienic.

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:30.175
I mean it's so nasty that your dog probably 
wouldn’t eat this, I mean I know mine wouldn't eat it

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.040
I know mine wouldn’t eat it because she dead,
but that’s besides the point.

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.400
It's just *Dracula disgust noises*

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.120
And of course when you’re stuck in this situation,
you try to keep to yourself, hold

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.540
out against the hunger and refuse to
eat it which is what Goreng does.

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.420
Since he know’s this food is  disgusting but 
ultimately, hunger wins out and he gives in.

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:53.680
It’s a very difficult dilemma to deal with and this conflict

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.360
In-and-of-itself is a key part of the
narrative and theme of the movie: how do people

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:03.580
deal with being in an extreme situation where
their class or level, determines their privileged

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:04.920
How do we react?

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:05.930
How do we deal?

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:06.930
Do we try to play along?

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.471
Do we try to do what we can to
screw the other guy?

00:04:09.471 --> 00:04:13.459
Or do we try and refuse to partake in the
institution and systems that put us in this

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:15.530
situation like Goreng tries to do?

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.130
And this doesn’t have to be for just
food, you could apply this similar principle

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:25.280
to other things like medicine, fuel, money, weapons,
clothing or shelter as some examples

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.220
And as we see already, it seems that the best
option is to partake in the system for your

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:34.200
own survival, nothing against the other guy,
it's just I'm trying to get by and do what’s

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.470
best for me

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:39.490
A very rational egoist argument.
Now, as I said before

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:44.000
People do what's best for them or what they think is best
for them, so some people toss themselves down the

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.970
hole, some people murder each other which at least
means there’s more food for everyone else

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.590
or sometimes you get people like Miharu.

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:58.310
This crazy mute chick whose obsessed with finding a
child-her child specifically. Whose been kept here in this

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:04.500
prison, and she's been a long time going up and down
the platform searching for her missing child

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:08.700
and who ultimately saves Goreng’s
life after Trimagasi tries to kill him.

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:12.680
Ultimately this goes on for months, with Goreng
losing bits and pieces of his mind to the

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:16.620
savagery and craziness of this whole situation

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:22.000
Especially when he’s taken to Level 252
where food barely arrives

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.500
and is given a different cell mate named Imoguiri
whose name I totally butchered

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:31.480
who was the woman who interviewed 
Goreng before allowing him entry into the prison

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:35.880
and who suffers a grisly fate
in order to save Goreng

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:41.190
Later, Goreng meets his new celly named Baharat,
on Level 6 who initially tries to rope climb

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:45.960
his way out and up to Level 0 but then 
Goreng comes up with a different plan

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:50.380
If a scarcity of food is the problem then they
have to make sure everyone has enough to eat

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:55.978
and to do so,  the two of them ride the platform down together and ration out the food to the prisoners

00:05:55.978 --> 00:05:57.880
and as a prelude to the rebellion.

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:02.611
The two of them [plan to] send up a panna cotta up to
Level 0 as proof that they can change the

00:06:02.611 --> 00:06:05.860
system and have the conviction
to not mess up their plan.

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:09.230
Although this proves waaay more difficult
than expected because there’s more than

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:15.960
300 levels, in fact there are 333 and usually
by floor 100, there’s no more food left

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.800
but the scraps of scraps.

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:22.560
Which still holds true even with the rationing
but when the duo finally arrive to the bottom

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:27.240
they find a child, Miharu's child, to whom they give the cream dessert [edit: NOT CHEESE]

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:30.660
before sending her up
on the platform, back up to Level 0.

00:06:30.669 --> 00:06:35.670
With the film ending with the child rising,
leaving behind Goreng and Baharat.

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:38.199
So with all of that said, it’s very clear that
this movie is very artsy.

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:43.400
It’s not your typical film: there’s a message here
there are fantastical elements here,

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:48.500
there is a clear thesis statement being
made that gives this movie a "character"

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:52.380
And it’s because of these factors that I 
believe you shouldn’t look at this movie like a

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:58.240
strange, unexplainable and twist ending
movie like we usually cover on this channel

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:02.980
Instead you should look at this as a story 
This film is very much a fable or an allegory

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:07.220
like Plato’s Cave with a very
clear takeaway about humanity

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:10.610
what drives us to betray each other
and how do we resolve that?

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:14.620
My takeway is that the big thing that does so 
in the first place, that is to say that divides us

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:18.100
are the systems that are in place:
the film is set in a dystopian future

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:20.760
where resources are scarce and people voluntarily

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:25.560
enter prison because there are net benefits
which is absurd to me

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:29.780
But as we see, the whole things kinda scam
with people set up for failure when a crucial

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:32.380
part of existing is limited a.k.a. food

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:37.180
and so the haves and the have-nots are
divided instantly by their levels

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:41.380
With those in the lower crusts assuredly
despising those on top all the while

00:07:41.389 --> 00:07:48.069
suffering from starvation and insanity brought upon by hunger and in order to have some sense of agency

00:07:48.069 --> 00:07:54.340
These people go to extreme lengths like killing each
other or cannibalizing for the sake of survival

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:57.700
While those up top, have to live with guilt
or apathy of their feasting:

00:07:57.700 --> 00:07:59.440
Do they eat just enough to get by?

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:04.360
Do they eat as much as they can since in a
month’s time they might be able to eat as much

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:07.580
Food anymore? Should we think of me
Or should we think you?

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:10.880
there’s a very clear class warfare theme going
on throughout this movie although this film

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:15.180
doesn't just focus on the ups and downs
of being up and down.

00:08:15.189 --> 00:08:20.199
It also looks at class warfare horizontally,
that is to say, what divides people who are

00:08:20.199 --> 00:08:21.379
in the same boat?

00:08:21.379 --> 00:08:25.620
Tamagasi does whatever he can to screw over
the other inmates because that is as much

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:29.949
power as he can get inside of here
besides simply killing his celly.

00:08:29.949 --> 00:08:31.659
Other than that there’s not much to do.

00:08:31.659 --> 00:08:36.169
Though at the same time, you have someone
like Miharu who does kill Tamagasi out of

00:08:36.169 --> 00:08:40.240
her own moral code, although what
divides her from Tamagasi is

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:48.020
her psychological and intrinsic need and desire which is
the want to find her child in this prison and whether

00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:52.940
Whether she knew it or not but by saving Goreng,
she allows Goreng to fulfill this want for

00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:58.160
her by the end of the film and rescue her child
by putting her on the platform heading up

00:08:58.160 --> 00:08:59.250
to Level 0.

00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:02.640
Conversely, the film also talks
about what drives people together:

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:08.400
familiarity and selflessness like with 
Imoguiri whose name I again butchered

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:13.420
and who as I said before, Goreng knew prior to being imprisoned, because she was his interviewer

00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:17.120
and who ultimately sacrifices her body for Goreng’s survival

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:22.720
Now the thing is the woman herself didn’t know that it
would be this bad in here and as a former interviewer

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:27.170
who sent people to this pit, her sacrifice
would be the first step towards making up

00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:32.279
for potentially sending hundreds to their
deaths and enacting change within through

00:09:32.279 --> 00:09:39.279
Goreng and his stomach, giving Goreng the strength to continue on in this prison and potentially enact change

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:44.660
inside and who ultimately succeeds
by meeting up and working with Baharat

00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:49.080
and together they bond over their
simple and heroic plan.

00:09:49.089 --> 00:09:54.690
Their humane plan to control the system, inversely, for
the betterment of everyone who is controlled

00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:55.890
by said system.

00:09:55.890 --> 00:10:01.240
Throwing away the rational egoism and pessimism
for something more optimistic if utilitarian.

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:05.480
Sort of like an ant colony kept inside a glass
box by a human, there’s not much they can

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:09.040
do to break the glass, so might as well as
start digging in this sand

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:13.060
Much in a similar way, the prisoners have
to exploit the system and do what they can

00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:15.640
with the rules provided and it's very clear that

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:19.010
There’s a big theme and message here about overconsumption and sustainability.

00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:23.880
A society that is constrained and limited
in resource, must be smart with how they manage

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:27.920
their resources. So if the resources
are allocated in such a way

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:32.180
that only a small number of people can 
benefit, you screw over a lot of people

00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:37.690
which morally is wrong and probably isn't 
going to work in your favor in the long term

00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:42.720
Because even then, the film proposes that the
position of those at the top is precarious

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:47.960
and those people won’t always be up there which
is an interesting take on the whole issue

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:53.020
of resources and resource management. Now mind you these resources don't have to strictly be food

00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:54.540
They can also be manpower

00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:58.420
As evidence of this idea, by the end of the film,
we Goreng and Baharat themselves

00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:04.950
become these human resources as rationeers of the
food which is ironic considering that the

00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:10.320
words ‘goreng’ and ‘baharat’ refers
to fried foods and a spice blend respectively.

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:14.829
Kind of like a Dragon Ball Z naming scheme
going on over here but anyway

00:11:14.829 --> 00:11:18.570
In the end, we as people have got to lift each
other up, we have to do what we can with what

00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:23.660
we got, and if possible fight against the injustice
within a system like a knight of a chivalric

00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:27.680
story. Goreng himself goes from "just some dude"

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:33.100
to what could be described as a knight, having a just cause to fight for, a maiden to save, as well as

00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:38.660
his own giants to slay whether they
be a person or a system

00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:44.300
And I think that we have got to do that too:
be humanistic, be empathetic, be hopeful that

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:48.760
we can enact change even if we have to go
out on the frontlines to ration out what supplies

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:52.960
and resources we have even if it's at
our own expense like

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:58.839
skills, talents, experience, or
worst case scenario--our lives.

00:11:58.839 --> 00:12:02.459
Because nothing lasts forever and the carrying capacity
of the planet is only going to decrease until

00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:05.860
solutions are found. Stop gaps or otherwise.

00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:14.620
We have to approach this issue with the hope of Esther
Boserup rather than the cynicism of Thomas Malthus

00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:16.960
And one last thing before I go, ironically, although

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:21.470
Don Quixote was a satire of romantic stories
of dashing knights saving fair maidens and

00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:27.540
being utterly idealistic and lambasting such
ideals: the story, the Don Quijote tale

00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:33.040
a satire, led to a resurgence of the very genre,
Cervantes was trying to make fun of

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:38.160
In the end hope and idealism is the way forward, regardless of where you stand on the political spectrum,

00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:42.910
and in the current political climate, with
the activism, the division, and outspokenness

00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:46.761
of people in many different countries: I think
we should keep in mind that we all live here

00:12:46.761 --> 00:12:51.930
on the planet in a boring neo-cyberpunk corporate
world full of organizations and systems that

00:12:51.930 --> 00:12:56.730
want to keep us at each other’s throats
instead of knocking on the doors of the upper

00:12:56.730 --> 00:13:01.500
echelons. But I digress, what do you guys think?
Do you agree with the points I made?

00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:03.380
Do you think the movie was a
bit too blunt or preachy?

00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:05.420
What is your takeaway from the film?

00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:06.820
