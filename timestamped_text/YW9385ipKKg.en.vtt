00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.920
a few difficulties getting cocaine export to the&nbsp;
country so they decided to try new ideas they want&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.800
to get their drugs into the united states but the&nbsp;
runway for the planes is too risky for most pilots&nbsp;&nbsp;

cell and tells him that his house will get raided&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.800

family moved to a remote town mena arkansas&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.880

them robbing his stuff instead of taking his guns&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.400
barry calls schafer to let him know that&nbsp;
the contras are not interested in the guns&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.640
on his second trip he brings gifts to&nbsp;
the contrast to avoid them robbing him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.840
he meets with the cartel leader again jorge to&nbsp;
negotiate sending the guns to the cartel instead&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.360
barry brings guns to the cartel and ships their&nbsp;
drugs to the u.s and the contras while trying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:54.640
his hardest to avoid being detected by the law the&nbsp;
whole operation got so big barry had to get some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:00.960
help barry gets four other men pete stan cooper&nbsp;
and bob to help him on his trips when he realizes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:06.000

off they fly separate planes on their missions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.280
delivering the drugs schafer then asked barry to&nbsp;

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.400
as barry's business grows he starts to contribute&nbsp;
to the community and provide even more for his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:27.040
family while also shamelessly indulging in his&nbsp;
wealth and setting up fronts in the community&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:33.280
to hide all the money he has over 105 million&nbsp;
dollars saved in trust in banks even some packed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:38.800
in bags at home some buried in the wood behind&nbsp;
his house and 90 pounds of gold in his closet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.920
not to talk of one of the bank and mana that built&nbsp;

eventually he started stealing from barry money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:01.920
he was hiding the hangar using it to buy himself&nbsp;
a new car and to pick up an underage girl the dea&nbsp;&nbsp;

starts to go after the pilots on one mission berry&nbsp;
crash lands and loses a significant portion of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:13.200
drugs meanwhile the cartel runs into trouble&nbsp;
when escobar declares war on the government&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:18.000
and the cartel gets kicked out of colombia&nbsp;
barry must meet with them to sort out the issues&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:23.760
at the same time jb gets arrested by the town's&nbsp;

what's been going on schafer says the contras left&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:58.160

choice so that he can escape his prosecution&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:42.960
they ask barry to get photos that tie the&nbsp;
mendellin cartel to the nicaraguan sandonistas&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:48.000
