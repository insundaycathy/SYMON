00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:06.320
Hi, Mystery Recapped here. Today I’m&nbsp;
going to explain a Horror Sci Fi film&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:16.000
called “Parasyte: Part 1,” Spoilers&nbsp;
ahead! Watch out and take care!
 
&nbsp;

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.400
The movie begins with mysterious aliens called the&nbsp;
Parasites starting their invasion of humans. They&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:28.560
infect humans by entering their brains. One such&nbsp;
parasite enters the brain of a middle aged man&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.200
sleeping next to his wife while another such&nbsp;
parasite tries to enter the brain of a high&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:39.440
school student named Shinichi Izumi. However,&nbsp;
the alien fails to bypass Shinichi’s earphones,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.920
and hence resorts to infecting&nbsp;
his right hand instead. Startled,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.840
Shinichi screams and tries to get it out. After&nbsp;
hearing him screaming, Shinichi’s mother Nobuko&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:55.360
rushes to check up on her son. She checks his hand&nbsp;
but doesn’t find anything wrong. She calls it his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:01.360
imagination and tells him to go back to sleep.
By next morning, the alien in the man’s body eats&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:07.600
his brain and takes over his human consciousness.&nbsp;
It then decapitates the man’s wife and feeds on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:13.440
it. Meanwhile, Shinichi surprisingly retains his&nbsp;
human consciousness, possibly due to the way of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.240
entry of the alien that entered his body. The&nbsp;
alien seems to have taken over Shinichi’s right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.920
hand and makes him do things beyond his control.&nbsp;
Like randomly grabbing Shinichi’s girlfriend&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:29.600
Satomi Murano, extending the length of Shinichi’s&nbsp;
right hand to grab things and throwing a ball into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:38.480
the basket from a distance without even looking.
Puzzled and worried, Shinichi confronts his right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:44.160
hand with a box cutter knife, forcing the alien&nbsp;
to reveal itself. It turns out, the alien can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:49.920
shape shift. It transforms his right hand into&nbsp;
a snake, frightening poor Shinichi. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.040
unlike the other aliens who are ruthless killers,&nbsp;
the alien that has taken over Shinichi’s hand is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:00.080
more friendly. It reveals that it was supposed&nbsp;
to feed on Shinichi’s brain but failed to do so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:06.000
because of his earphones. Now, it has permanently&nbsp;
become a part of Shinichi’s right hand and will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.520
live as long as the boy lives. With no other&nbsp;
choice, Shinichi befriends the parasite and names&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:17.520
him “Migi”. As Migi learns about the Japanese&nbsp;
language, Sword fighting, human anatomy, archery,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.640
the other alien goes on a killing rampage.
While returning from school, Migi senses the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.280
presence of other brain eating aliens and&nbsp;
drags Shinichi to a nearby restaurant. They&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.560
find the main door closed so they sneak into the&nbsp;
restaurant through the back door. To their horror,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:38.720
Migi and Shinichi witness the brain eating alien&nbsp;
feeding on a human. The alien senses Migi’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:44.400
presence and happily welcomes it. However, the&nbsp;
alien soon realizes that Migi hasn’t killed the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.840
human host. The alien then starts walking towards&nbsp;
the boy with a lust in his eyes for his brain.
&nbsp;

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:56.640
Migi warns the alien to back off, knowing that if&nbsp;
Shinichi dies, Migi will die with him. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:02.480
the alien reveals that although two alien brains&nbsp;
can’t reside in one human head, Migi can reside in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:08.480
the alien’s host’s hand. The alien then amputates&nbsp;
its host’s hand and asks Migi to move over, so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:14.800
the alien could feed on Shinichi’s brain. However,&nbsp;
Migi declines and the two aliens fight each other.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.520
Migi makes use of the sword fighting lessons&nbsp;
and decapitates the alien’s host’s body,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:24.000
consequently killing the alien. 
Relieved, Shinichi thanks Migi for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.720
saving his life. However, Migi tells him&nbsp;
that it killed the alien only because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.280
the alien’s transfering proposal was&nbsp;
risky so preferred living in his hand.
&nbsp;

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.600
It is revealed that Migi is able to survive&nbsp;
in its host’s hand because of the nutrients&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.600
it is getting from Shinichi’s diet. Migi&nbsp;
tells him that it will protect him from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:48.240
everything as long as it gets nutrients from him.
Meanwhile Detective Hirama starts investigating&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:52.160
the murders. He suspects that a&nbsp;
cannibalistic killer is on the loose.
&nbsp;

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:02.160
The next day in school, Shinichi’s principal&nbsp;
introduces a new teacher named Ryoko Tamiya.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:07.600
To Shinichi’s dismay, Migi reveals that his&nbsp;
new teacher has been taken over by an alien.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:12.800
They later confront Tamiya. Tamiya assures them&nbsp;
that she means no harm and invites them to talk&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:18.560
after school. They later meet at an aquatic zoo,&nbsp;
where Tamiya introduces them to two other aliens:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:24.320
Shimada Hideo, a high school student and&nbsp;
Mr. A, a police officer. The aliens ask&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.960
Tamiya why she brought them to meet a human. 
Tamiya, who seems more reasonable compared to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:34.560
other aliens, reveals her interest in studying&nbsp;
the humans' way of life. She even had sex with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:39.760
Mr. A for her research. She reveals she&nbsp;
is now pregnant with a normal human baby.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:44.800
Tamiya feels that they all need each other to&nbsp;
survive and find the purpose of their life. She&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.440
is also concerned about the killings being highly&nbsp;
reported in the media and is looking for ways to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:55.760
feed on humans without creating a media spectacle.&nbsp;
She asks Migi and Shinichi to cooperate with them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:00.800
When Shinichi and Migi decline her offer,&nbsp;
Tamiya warns them of dire consequences if they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:07.200
try to get in their way. She reminds them that&nbsp;
Satomi and the entire school is at her mercy.
&nbsp;

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:12.880
Back at home, seeing Shinichi so distant of late,&nbsp;
his mother asks him if he’s okay. She nudges him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:18.080
to open up, but Shinichi only gets irritated&nbsp;
and tells her that he is not a child anymore and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:25.840
doesn’t have to tell his mother everything.
The next day, while returning from school,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:31.840
Migi and Shinichi run into Mr. A. Migi senses&nbsp;
the alien’s intention to kill and asks Shinichi&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:37.600
to avoid him. Shinichi heeds his advice and&nbsp;
runs away but Mr. A follows him into a secluded&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:43.600
alley. With no other choice, Migi decides to&nbsp;
finally confront him and order him to back off.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:48.560
Mr. A warns them that he is not like Tamiya. He&nbsp;
reveals that he heard about the parasite that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:54.800
Migi murdered in a restaurant. He calls Migi a&nbsp;
“dangerous” parasite who must be dealt with. An&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:01.200
intense battle follows. As Migi and Mr. A fight,&nbsp;
Shinichi slowly moves closer to the alien hiding&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:06.480
a metal pipe in his left hand. When he gets close&nbsp;
enough, Migi gives him a greenlight and Shinichi&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:12.560
impales Mr. A with the pipe. As Mr. A collapses&nbsp;
on the ground, a frightened Shinichi runs away.
&nbsp;

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:16.640
Shinichi is shaken after killing&nbsp;
a man but Migi, amused by nature,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:21.200
reminds him that the alien had already killed&nbsp;
the human when it took over the host’s body. 
&nbsp;

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:26.320
Meanwhile, while returning home from the market,&nbsp;
Shinichi’s mother notices the helpless Mr. A&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:30.960
in the alley. She nervously inquires&nbsp;
if he is okay from a distance.
&nbsp;

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:36.000
Back at home, Migi suspects that an alien is&nbsp;
approaching their home. Frightened, Shinichi&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.280
rushes to the kitchen and grabs a knife. The door&nbsp;
opens and it is revealed to be Shinichi’s mother&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:47.200
Nobuko. Migi warns him that Mr. A has taken over&nbsp;
his mother’s body but Shinichi refuses to believe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:52.960
it. Mr. A has separated from his old body and&nbsp;
moved into Shinichi’s mother’s body. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:58.160
the mere suggestion upsets Shinichi and he&nbsp;
threatens to kill Migi if it doesn’t stop talking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:04.560
“nonsense”. However, Shinichi’s worst fear comes&nbsp;
true and Mr. A speaks through Shinichi’s mother,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:10.320
confirming Migi’s claims. Shinichi breaks into&nbsp;
tears and goes into denial. He apologises to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:14.720
his mother for hiding the truth from her and&nbsp;
pleads with her to stop joking with him. 
&nbsp;

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:20.720
Disregarding his emotions, Mr. A then pierces&nbsp;
Shinichi’s heart and mortally injures him. Migi&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:25.600
screams in disbelief as Shinichi collapses&nbsp;
on the ground. Mr. A tells Migi that it is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:31.040
over for both Migi and Shinichi. As Mr.&nbsp;
A leaves, Migi enters Shinichi’s body&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:36.480
through the hole that Mr. A left on his back. 
Two days pass by and Shinichi lays motionless&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:41.440
in his home. He eventually gains consciousness&nbsp;
and gets up. Migi reveals that it used a piece&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:46.320
of itself to cover the hole in Shinichi’s body&nbsp;
and left a part of itself in his heart that had&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:51.120
been destroyed. Migi then returned back to&nbsp;
Shinichi’s right hand. It was an experiment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:56.320
but fortunately, it worked. However,&nbsp;
Shinichi is not so excited about being alive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:01.520
after losing his mother. He tells Migi that it&nbsp;
should have let him die and breaks into tears.
&nbsp;

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:06.880
After collecting himself, Shinichi heads to his&nbsp;
school to confront Tamiya. He asks her about Mr.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:12.640
A but she refuses to disclose his whereabouts.&nbsp;
Angered, Shinichi shoots a knife at her but she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:17.840
effortlessly blocks his attack and leaves.
Meanwhile, Detective Hirama finds Shinichi’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:22.720
finger prints on the iron pipe and restaurant. 
Still grieving, Shinichi wanders around the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:27.600
city and comes across a political rally. Migi&nbsp;
determines that the politician named Takeshi&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:33.040
Hirokawa addressing the crowd has been taken&nbsp;
over by an alien. It speculates that the aliens&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:42.000
want to create a place where they can eat humans.
Later, Detective Hirama drops by Shinichi’s home.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.480
He asks him about the policeman’s murder&nbsp;
but Shinichi denies have any knowlege. 
&nbsp;

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:51.280
The next day, Satomi introduces Shinichi&nbsp;
to Shimada, one of the members of Tamiya’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:56.240
network. Satomi reveals Shimada has just&nbsp;
transferred to their school. She forces&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:00.320
Shinichi to shake hands with the alien.&nbsp;
The alien tries to squeeze Shinichi's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:05.760
left hand but to his astonishment, Shinichi&nbsp;
squeezes the alien's hand with equal force.
&nbsp;

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:10.800
Migi speculates that the cell it used to repair&nbsp;
Shinichi’s heart might be still alive inside&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:16.000
him and is changing Shinichi’s body to become&nbsp;
stronger like the alien bodies. It is also having&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:22.080
perceptible effects on Shinichi’s personality as&nbsp;
once a shy and docile Shinichi keeps insisting on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:27.520
finding and challenging Mr. A. Migi tells him&nbsp;
that he can’t always be there to protect him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:33.440
because he must sleep for 4 hours each day and&nbsp;
unlike humans, Migi can’t choose when to sleep&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:40.240
and also can’t be woken up during those hours.
After a lengthy investigation, the police&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:44.560
determines that the parasites are responsible&nbsp;
for the series of killings in the city.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:49.280
They learn that the parasites can be identified&nbsp;
by their hair. When one pulls out their hair,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:53.440
their hair strand reacts by curling.
The next day, the principal learns about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:58.320
Tamiya’s pregnancy and forces her to&nbsp;
take maternity leave. Migi and Shinichi&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:02.880
are excited by the news but she reminds them that&nbsp;
Shimada will continue to keep an eye on them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:08.480
She reveals that Shimada is going to perfectly fit&nbsp;
in the school environment because just like her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:13.760
Shiramada doesn’t consume human meat.
Meanwhile, Shimada is in the art room volunteering&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:19.040
to be the art model for Satomi and her friends.&nbsp;
While guiding Shimada to find the right pose,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:24.880
Satomi’s friend pulls out his hair. To her horror,&nbsp;
the hair starts curling. The girl and her friends&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:30.080
realize that Shimada is a parasite and start&nbsp;
panicking. She tries to run away but Shimada&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:35.520
drags her back in. He then proceeds towards the&nbsp;
girls but Satomi hurls a bottle of paint remover&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:40.560
into the alien’s mouth. The chemical disfigures&nbsp;
the alien and makes him go out of control.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:45.680
Satomi encourages the girls to run but Shimada&nbsp;
stops them and starts executing the girls.
&nbsp;

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:51.360
Migi senses Shimada’s killing intent and rushes&nbsp;
to the art room. To his horror, he comes across a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:57.200
trail of dead bodies of his classmates causing him&nbsp;
to have a panic attack. Migi helps him calm down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:01.200
and they then continue looking for Shimada.&nbsp;
They eventually spot the alien proceeding&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:06.960
to kill Satomi. Shinichi saves her and confronts&nbsp;
Shimada but suddenly Tamiya appears from behind.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:11.840
Upset with Shimada for causing this mess,&nbsp;
Tamiya scolds him and throws a DIY bomb&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:16.320
towards him. With the bomb seconds away from&nbsp;
exploding, Shinichi quickly grabs an injured&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:20.880
Satomi and jumps out of the building.
After the explosion, the police arrive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:25.600
and confront the alien who has survived the&nbsp;
blast. Shinichi sends Satomi to a hospital&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:30.720
in an ambulance before returning to finish&nbsp;
Shimada. Shinichi shoots a metal rod from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:36.720
another building and kills the alien for good.
Tamiya then appears and tells Migi and Shinichi&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:41.040
that she is going to disappear for a while&nbsp;
until she has her baby. Before departing,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:45.120
she hands Shinichi the location&nbsp;
of the Mr. A-possessed Nobuko. 
&nbsp;

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:51.040
Shinichi finds Mr. A at the address and secretly&nbsp;
follows him into a bridge. However, Migi suddenly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:57.040
tells him that they must return as Migi is feeling&nbsp;
sleepy. Shinichi can’t believe in his bad luck.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:02.560
Migi gives him his good wishes and transforms&nbsp;
into a sword before falling asleep. Mr. A finally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:08.160
notices Shinichi and is stunned to learn that he&nbsp;
is still alive. The alien then launches an attack&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:13.600
but is even more surprised by Shinichi’s speed.&nbsp;
While dodging Mr. A’s attacks, Shinichi starts&nbsp;&nbsp;
