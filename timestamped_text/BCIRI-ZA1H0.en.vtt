to his home kong leads the crew toward the tunnel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:02.800

of kong's ancestors he picks up an axe made from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:55.520
a spike off the back of godzilla's ancestors and&nbsp;
he finds his family's throne room and sits upon&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:02.480
it like a true king the trio also discover a room&nbsp;
with the skull of ghidorah they saw that ren is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:08.560
controlling mechagodzilla using a scenic uplink&nbsp;
connected with one of the skulls of ghidorah the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:14.720
axe activates the energy source in the ground on&nbsp;
the surface godzilla has entered hong kong making&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:20.880
the people run in chaos on every corner godzilla&nbsp;
then finds the source leading to hollow earth he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:27.200
breathes down it and sends a blast making a large&nbsp;
hole to the ground maya then sends out apex spider&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:32.720
drones to take out a sample of the source for her&nbsp;
father to exploit despite protests from nathan and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:40.320
eileen mayu commands his crew to hold up guns on&nbsp;
eileen when kong sees this he got angry from up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:46.800
above bad creatures descend and attack kong and&nbsp;
the crew and kong fights them off in the chaos&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:53.040
mayu and her team try to shoot kong down only for&nbsp;
him to grab their craft and crush it in his paw&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:59.040
kong takes his axe out and he then jumps through&nbsp;
the portal with nathan eileen and gia following&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:05.120
in their craft while in hong kong the trio are&nbsp;
then caught and apprehended by the apex guards&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:12.320
then begins round two with godzilla they trash the&nbsp;
city and demolish skyscrapers but kong comes back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:18.480
with a fury by bringing down the axon godzilla it&nbsp;
was a furious and long fight and both our match&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:25.360
his blue flame doesn't affect the axe and in fact&nbsp;
charges it with the blue energy so kong manages to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:30.640
bring godzilla down hard with one swing the&nbsp;
trio are brought to walter who is planning&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:36.160
to set mechagodzilla onto the real godzilla to&nbsp;
establish humanity's dominance over the creatures&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:43.680
however godzilla gets himself back up and another&nbsp;
long fight again then godzilla able to bring kong&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:49.840
down again with his foot he roars in kong's face&nbsp;
but kong remains defiant and roars right back at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:57.280
him godzilla spares him and starts walking away&nbsp;
unfortunately at the station where mca godzilla is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:03.200
a failure occurred just as ren begins the uplink&nbsp;
to mechagodzilla ghidorah's consciousness takes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:09.040
control mechagodzilla swings its clawed walter&nbsp;
killing him while ren is electrocuted from the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:15.280
override the metal beast rises to the surface and&nbsp;
goes after godzilla beginning to overpower him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:21.920
with its strength and stronger heat blast godzilla&nbsp;
was no match and took the beating meanwhile when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:27.840
jia senses kong's heartbeat slowing down nathan&nbsp;
uses the apex vehicle to deliver a charge powerful&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:34.320
enough to revive kong when he wakes up jia&nbsp;
tells kong that godzilla is not the enemy he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:39.120
understands and charges to fight mechagodzilla&nbsp;
before it can deliver the fatal blow to godzilla&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:45.920
and godzilla joins the fight realizing kong is&nbsp;
on his side they both fight the robot with all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:51.760
their might it was a long fight and kong was&nbsp;
almost killed godzilla charges kong's axe with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:56.720
his blue fire breath and the mighty age starts&nbsp;
chopping mechagodzilla's limbs off before ripping&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:02.880
its head off and showing it off as a trophy&nbsp;
in the aftermath madison reunites with mark&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:09.440
and he meets bernie who wants to have him on the&nbsp;
podcast to discuss more apex and monarch cover-ups&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:14.880
godzilla then rises and looks at kong&nbsp;
who drops his axe to signify their truce&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:19.600
the titans look at each other as worthy opponents&nbsp;
before godzilla goes back into the ocean&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:25.280
nathan and eileen set up a new research facility&nbsp;
in hollow earth which kong has made his new home&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:31.840
he continues his friendship with jia and goes&nbsp;
about the land where he is now once again the king
