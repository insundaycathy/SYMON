Welcome back for another 5 minute movie recap.

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:05.440
Today, I'm going to give you an overview of a 2018&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.880
American post-apocalyptic horror&nbsp;
thriller film called 'Bird Box'.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.600
The film is directed by Susanne Bier and&nbsp;
stars Sandra Bullock as Malorie Hayes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.080
The story follows Malorie, as she fights&nbsp;
to defend herself and two children from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.440
creatures that make anyone who stare at&nbsp;
them go crazy and end their own lives.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.120
There will be Spoilers ahead,&nbsp;
so please proceed with caution.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.560
Okay, let's begin.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.760
Malorie Hayes tells two young,&nbsp;
unidentified children that they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.120
would be rowing along a river in a&nbsp;
rowboat in a post-apocalyptic world.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.640
She warns them that if they remove&nbsp;
their blindfolds, they would perish.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.600
Jessica, Malorie's sister, pays a visit&nbsp;
to a pregnant Malorie five years ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.240
Unprecedented mass suicides are rapidly&nbsp;
spreading across Europe, according to a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:51.200
television investigation. Malorie watches a lady&nbsp;
injuring herself while in the hospital for a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:57.040
regular exam before others panic and pandemonium&nbsp;
ensues. Jessica sees the creature, which causes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.600
her to destroy her car recklessly before stepping&nbsp;
in front of an oncoming truck and killing herself.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.880
A woman invites Malorie inside her home for&nbsp;
protection while she flees on foot. After&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.840
seeing the creature, the lady enters a trance and&nbsp;
sits inside a flaming automobile, which explodes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:17.040
Malorie is picked up off the street by a stranger,&nbsp;
Tom, and they are welcomed inside the house,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.760
where around a dozen other people are seeking&nbsp;
refuge. One is a grocery store employee who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.400
believes that demonic beings have invaded Earth&nbsp;
and are driving humans mad. When they leave the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.200
house, they blindfold themselves and cover all&nbsp;
the windows. The owner of the home agrees to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.600
check the security cameras to keep an eye on the&nbsp;
creatures, but he kills himself while doing so.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.880
Olympia, a new pregnant survivor, arrives,&nbsp;
and owing to dwindling food supplies,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.000
half of the gang heads to a local store. Malorie&nbsp;
receives several pet birds and their belongings,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.800
and the presence of the beings leads the birds&nbsp;
to go insane. A coworker of Charlie's attacks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.120
the group, but Charlie sacrifices himself to&nbsp;
save the others, who make it back to the house.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:01.200
Felix and Lucy eventually take the vehicle and&nbsp;
drive away. Against Douglas' desires, Olympia&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.400
invites Gary, a stranger, inside the house.&nbsp;
Douglas is knocked unconscious and imprisoned&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:11.200
in the garage after threatening Gary with a&nbsp;
firearm. Gary works on several sketches of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.480
entities and goes into a trance before exposing&nbsp;
Douglas to the entities. He knocks out Tom while&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.760
Olympia and Malorie go into labour at the same&nbsp;
time. Gary then goes upstairs and uncovers all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:27.200
of the room's windows putting everyone in danger.&nbsp;
Olympia fails to turn away in time, as a result of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.640
seeing the light, she ends her life by jumping out&nbsp;
the window. Gary overpowers Cheryl and forces her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.400
to look at the creatures, forcing her to stab&nbsp;
herself in the neck with a pair of scissors.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.840
Malorie hides with both of the newborn infants&nbsp;
beneath a blanket. Douglas uses a shotgun to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:47.360
try and stop Gary, but Gary manages to use a pair&nbsp;
of scissors to kill Douglas. While Malorie looks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.920
after the babies, Tom regains consciousness&nbsp;
just in time to overpower and put down Gary.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.720
After five years, Tom and Malorie have moved&nbsp;
in with the children, who are referred to as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.840
'Boy' and 'Girl.' They get a message from a&nbsp;
survivor who tells them of a safe colony concealed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.880
in the woods. They are attacked by a group of the&nbsp;
unblindfolded survivors as they leave their house,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.840
and Tom rushes to distract them so Malorie&nbsp;
and the children may flee. Tom then exposes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.320
his eyes in order to see and kill the attackers,&nbsp;
but he is subsequently afflicted by the entities.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:20.560
Malorie and the children travel along&nbsp;
the river in a boat, blindfolded,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.120
carrying the birds as a warning against the&nbsp;
entities. In the rapids, the boat flips,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.520
but they manage to find each other. When&nbsp;
Malorie slips down a hill, the entities&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.280
attempt to use Malorie's voice to persuade&nbsp;
the youngsters to remove their blindfolds.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.360
Malorie regains consciousness and&nbsp;
tells the kids where she may be found.

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.560
They ultimately arrive at the village, which&nbsp;
is a former blind school. Malorie ultimately&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.200
releases the birds and names the children, Tom&nbsp;
and Olympia, recognising herself as their mother.
