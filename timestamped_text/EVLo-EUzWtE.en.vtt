gives a timid smile and expresses her gratitude&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.760
in her room she looks for an outfit&nbsp;
that she thinks would impress john&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.960
she puts on a blue dress and heads downstairs&nbsp;
to say hi to john as they prepare dinner&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.240
she takes a glimpse of him while he&nbsp;
reaches for something in the cupboard&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.720
michelle notices that libby dressed differently&nbsp;
that evening and compliments her appearance&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.520
out of curiosity libby asks how the both of them&nbsp;
met and her mother explains that on a typical&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.800
day of writing on the porch john just appeared&nbsp;
john explains that he is an aquatic geneticist&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.280
he is part of a research team about freshwater&nbsp;
animals and tries to solve problems in nature&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.560
he continues to demonstrate his study using two&nbsp;
glasses of water and ice as the two women listen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:08.080
attentively she begins to feel attracted to john&nbsp;
finding herself twirling her hair as he speaks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.280
just like her mother john coughs excessively after&nbsp;
eating a piece of vegetable michelle approaches&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.000
him and hugs him after he apologizes while they&nbsp;
embrace he touches libby on the shoulder and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.680
smiles at her this gives her a weird and confusing&nbsp;
feeling she has difficulty sleeping that night&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.640
because john's touch bothers her so much she goes&nbsp;
downstairs to grab a drink from the fridge but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.440
hears noises from her mom's bedroom which sounds&nbsp;
like she is making love with john she takes a peek&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.480
through a small gap at the bottom of the door but&nbsp;
someone approaches so she rushes back to her room&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.600
because of this she even forgets to close her door&nbsp;
john passes by and takes a look at her while she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.560
pretends to sleep the following day libby wakes&nbsp;
up and finds her mother and john in the kitchen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.520
having a moment she disturbs them by entering the&nbsp;
room abruptly michelle tells her that the three&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.720
of them will be going on a hike she reminds her&nbsp;
mom that it is the 28th of august a special day&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.040
for the both of them and they should spend&nbsp;
time together instead they both go outside&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.320
in a nearby tree libby digs a hole using a&nbsp;
gardening shovel she understand cans that are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:14.000
labeled with her family members names she opens a&nbsp;
tin can and slides a note inside after kissing it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.120
she hands over a tin can to her mother but she&nbsp;
does not put anything libby gets sad over this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.280
and tells her that michelle never cared about&nbsp;
anything every year libby makes it a tradition&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.360
to put letters in the cans intended for her&nbsp;
family members michelle explains that she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:33.040
stopped making letters because as a child she&nbsp;
felt unwanted in her family after their argument&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:38.240
libby becomes quiet and decides to go for a walk&nbsp;
upon picking up a rock a centipede crawls on her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:42.960
hand she gets frightened by this and almost steps&nbsp;
on it just in time jon stops her by saying that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:48.720
it is a scala pendra a rare species of centipede&nbsp;
libby tells him that it bit her but jon explains&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.800
that it is just trying to protect its offspring&nbsp;
as he lifts a piece of wood that reveals other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:58.000
centipedes hiding under it she shows him the&nbsp;
bite mark on her hand and he blows it carefully&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.720
he comforts her that she will be okay despite&nbsp;
the bite being venomous they continue to share&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.840
a conversation while taking a walk in the nearby&nbsp;
lake john apologizes to libby for disturbing their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.880
mother-daughter time and suggests that it would be&nbsp;
better if he leaves she disagrees telling him that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:18.240
he should stay back at the house libby goes to&nbsp;
her mother's room who currently has a stomachache&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:23.600
she apologizes to her mother for her behavior&nbsp;
earlier michelle apologizes as well for telling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.920
her too much information about their family&nbsp;
problems they both make up and forgive each other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.200
michelle also breaks big news to libby&nbsp;
she and john are planning to get married&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:39.200
libby says that she wants them to be happy but&nbsp;
she is obviously not thrilled about it one issue&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:45.120
is that john does not know michelle's actual age&nbsp;
he thinks that she is 35 when she is actually 42.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:50.240
libby researches more about scolopendras the&nbsp;
type of centipede she saw earlier on her laptop&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:55.680
from her window she sees john arrive at the house&nbsp;
after jogging she takes a peek at him removing his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:01.200
shirt and warming down after exercising she lies&nbsp;
down on her bed and sees the bracelet from john&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:05.440
she looks at it intently and decides to offer&nbsp;
him a drink she knocks on the basement store&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.920
where john conducts his study and research he&nbsp;
does not respond so she enters and sees the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:15.600
basement completely dark john hears libby and&nbsp;
asks her to turn her flashlight off she finally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:20.400
sees him holding a red light and offers him some&nbsp;
soda he respectfully declines as sodium is bad&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:26.880
for him so he chores her to his workplace instead&nbsp;
big aquariums fill the room john keeps lampreys&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:30.720
these are an ancient extant lineage of jawless&nbsp;
fish that have lived for millions of years&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.920
lampreys are parasitic and can adapt to their&nbsp;
hosts and their survival rate is highly unmatched&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:40.800
he discusses more about the fish with libby&nbsp;
who seems interested both in the topic and john&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:46.560
libby asks about john's marriage proposal to her&nbsp;
mother he responds by saying that michelle is very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:51.360
special to her and that they are very much happy&nbsp;
together both of them plan on getting more samples&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:56.080
from the lake so they ride on an inflatable&nbsp;
raft to go through the river libby asks john&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:01.360
questions about his past as he paddles he tries&nbsp;
to reach for a cage he uses to get samples and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:06.560
asks libby to hold his legs while he stretches his&nbsp;
arms they talk about libby's plans for college and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:11.280
how passionate she is in archaeology when all of a&nbsp;
sudden her period arrives and blood seeps through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:16.960
the raft john reacts quickly by covering it with&nbsp;
his shirt this frightens and embarrasses libby&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:22.240
but john also apologizes for how he reacted&nbsp;
the situation grows extremely awkward and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:27.440
uncomfortable for libby once they got home libby&nbsp;
takes a shower and removes the bracelet that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:32.960
john gave her he knocks and checks up on her&nbsp;
but she does not respond libby is starting to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:37.600
feel a weird vibe toward him she does not mind&nbsp;
his questions until she hears the door open&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:43.280
john enters the bathroom without libby knowing&nbsp;
while she showers john sniffs her from the shower&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:48.160
curtain as if he is craving for her unsatisfied&nbsp;
he also sniffs the shirt that was used to cover&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:53.040
libby's blood in the raft she senses that&nbsp;
someone is inside the bathroom she checks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:57.840
but john makes his way out in time she checks&nbsp;
on her mother to see if she's feeling better&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:02.320
but john is currently massaging michelle on&nbsp;
the back when she enters the room john gives&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:07.920
off an intense stare at her so she closes the door&nbsp;
libby tries to go to the basement but it is locked&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:12.800
she tries to access it from outside the house&nbsp;
but all light sources are blocked and sealed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:18.320
worried that john is hiding something she tries to&nbsp;
contact her best friend marley but the reception&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:24.160
is unstable she tries talking to marley using her&nbsp;
laptop to invite her to come over however marley&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:28.640
says she is unable to go and asks if there is a&nbsp;
problem libby writes back that her mom is marrying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:33.600
a freak of nature libby hears a knock on her door&nbsp;
and finds out that jon prepared a sandwich for her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:38.880
to make up for the awkward situation at the lake&nbsp;
that night a red light wakes her up she walks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:44.160
to her window to find its source she sees john&nbsp;
walking toward the red light coming from the lake&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:48.960
john submerges himself in the water and the light&nbsp;
goes off libby panics and gets confused about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:54.720
what she saw she tries to wake her mom up but&nbsp;
michelle is unresponsive she goes to the lake to

00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:02.400
she investigate him about what she saw he denies&nbsp;
it by saying that he suffers from sleepwalking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:06.720
livy walks out unconvinced the&nbsp;
following day michelle calls her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:12.000
she finds her mother in the bathroom throwing up&nbsp;
at this point michelle looks greatly unwell so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000
she asks libby to drive to the pharmacy and&nbsp;
get her some medicines in a pregnancy test&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:21.040
libby suggests that they call an ambulance&nbsp;
instead because she does not have a license yet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:25.520
libby asks where john is he is out for his daily&nbsp;
jogs and won't be back for at least an hour&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:31.360
her mom experiences more pain so she does not have&nbsp;
a choice but to rush to town at the pharmacy she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:36.560
sees jon walk by with another woman she follows&nbsp;
them but the cashier stops her as she forgot to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:42.080
pay libby gets home and sees marley in the living&nbsp;
room waiting for her she heads directly to her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:47.280
mother to give her some medicine john makes her&nbsp;
extremely uncomfortable while she is in the room&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:52.480
michelle continues to rest and john assures that&nbsp;
she will be taken care of before leaving john&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:57.600
gives her a menacing smile marley tells libby that&nbsp;
he finds jon hot and is thrilled to talk about him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:01.920
libby tells her what she saw last night at the&nbsp;
lake how jon grabbed her and the uncomfortable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:06.400
things she experienced libby asks if marley could&nbsp;
stay the night but she has an event to attend with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:10.560
her father marley gets furious after libby's&nbsp;
confessions she tells her that she will let&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:15.920
michelle know that jon is acting inappropriately&nbsp;
libby tries to eavesdrop on the conversation but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:20.240
she fails to hear anything while waiting for&nbsp;
marley to come down she falls asleep instead&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:25.280
she wakes up and heads to the living room john and&nbsp;
michelle are watching clips of libya when she was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:31.040
young michelle tells her that she is pregnant this&nbsp;
underwhelms libby and michelle gets disappointed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:35.680
in her reaction she gets mad at libby for always&nbsp;
coming up with negative comments about the men&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:41.360
that she dates she calms down when jon tells her&nbsp;
that it is okay as he hugs michelle he grins at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:46.320
libby his eyes deform and she pulls her mother&nbsp;
away from him michelle slaps her daughter out of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:52.320
anger because of this libby tells john the actual&nbsp;
age of her mother it disappoints jon very much&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:57.760
causing him to walk out the door upon exiting&nbsp;
michelle stops him and his body language shifts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:03.120
totally the mother and daughter continue to&nbsp;
argue in the living room that same night libby&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:07.680
guards the house by staying in the living room&nbsp;
after hearing thumping sounds from above she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:12.560
goes outside to check if something is on the roof&nbsp;
she goes around the house as she is very curious&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:17.440
about the noises she also looks over the lake&nbsp;
for any signs of john and points the flashlight&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:23.040
everywhere but finds nothing back inside she hears&nbsp;
john and michelle making love in their bedroom&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:27.600
she takes a peek inside and sees john's body&nbsp;
deform as if something is under his skin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:33.840
she goes to her room walks back to check on&nbsp;
them again but they are nowhere to be seen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:37.840
libby goes to the lake and finds something&nbsp;
in the water that looks like a spaceship&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:42.720
she uses the car's light to take a better look at&nbsp;
it but she forgets to set it to park when she got&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:48.480
out this causes the vehicle to be partly submerged&nbsp;
in water she turns on the light on a high beam and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:53.360
finds out that it is actually where the red light&nbsp;
came from it confirms her theory that jon is not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:58.640
human she tries to call marley for help but here's&nbsp;
a ringtone that seems to come from the basement&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:02.880
because of the blue light she is able to see&nbsp;
symbols on her wrist it came from the bracelet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:07.440
that john gave she sees her mother tied with&nbsp;
half her body submerged in a tank she sees&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:12.000
the same symbols on her mother's wrist and the&nbsp;
basement walls michelle gains consciousness and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.720
freaks out jon comes down but his feet look&nbsp;
entirely like that of a different creature&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:22.960
instantly he returns to his human form he checks&nbsp;
on michelle who is obviously in great pain and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:27.840
screeches in an alien-like manner she gives birth&nbsp;
to what seems to be a creature similar to john&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:34.080
however it does not survive which devastates jon&nbsp;
so he goes outside trying to revive the creature&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:39.120
libby scratches a part of the window to spy on&nbsp;
john she sees him transferring a blue light to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:44.480
the creature using his mouth she continues to&nbsp;
try and untangle michelle from the tank libby&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:49.040
locks the door and hears the creature snarling&nbsp;
outside the basement she sees marley's phone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:54.720
and dials 9-1-1 to ask for help she sees a device&nbsp;
that causes the signal not to work in their house&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:55.280 --> 00:12:00.560
john tries to talk to libby so he could get in&nbsp;
he becomes more agitated and takes his real form&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:05.360
she breaks the device while john smashes the&nbsp;
window using his hand libby is panicking and gets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:10.880
even more scared when she sees marley being eaten&nbsp;
by lampreys while hiding under the desk john grabs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:15.920
and strangles her a long and animal-like tongue&nbsp;
flicks out of his mouth but she manages to fight&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:21.520
back by pouring a bucket of salt on him this seems&nbsp;
to be john's weakness she gets michelle out of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:27.120
tank while john is still unconscious michelle&nbsp;
apologizes to libby for not believing in her as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:32.480
they try to escape and run away her mother falls&nbsp;
to the ground causing them to slow down someone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:37.440

an underground place where she is tied clones of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:42.640
john start appearing and smashing the room walls&nbsp;
revealing other dead bodies in tanks libby screams&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:47.040
out of fear and agony when one of the clones&nbsp;
approach her a blue kind of orb is transferred&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:52.880
to libby from john's mouth she refuses to swallow&nbsp;
it but he forces her to do so this knocks her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:58.000
unconscious again she wakes up with rashes all&nbsp;
over her face and finds that she is trapped in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:04.160
a diamond-shaped tank along with other bodies she&nbsp;
becomes restless as she panics eventually as the&nbsp;&nbsp;
