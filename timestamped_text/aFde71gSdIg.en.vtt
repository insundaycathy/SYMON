00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.969
Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:06.120
Today I'm going to explain a supernatural
drama film called A Ghost Story.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.580
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:12.440
Watch out and take careC and M are husband
and wife that happily live together in a small

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.340
house in Dallas, Texas.

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.080
The spouses are planning their big move and
are looking for a new home.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.880
She tells him that before she moves out from
a place, it is her habit to hide a note for

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.359
herself in there in case she returns.

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.550
While cuddling on their living room couch,
they hear weird and creaky noises.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.110
C looks at the wall and sees refractions of
light forming on the ceiling as well.

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:37.109
C is a talented musician; as he works from
home, M looks at house and apartment listings

00:00:37.109 --> 00:00:39.370
on the internet to plan where they'll live.

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.160
However, C does not seem too keen on looking
forward to leaving home.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.399
That afternoon, C drags some of their belongings
across the yard.

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.049
Without the help of her husband, she struggles
to carry the heavy stuff.

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:55.289
That night while they are sleeping, they hear
a loud noise coming from downstairs.

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.639
It seems like someone or something moved the
piano, which came with the house.

00:00:59.639 --> 00:01:03.839
C and M both come down, clueless about what
could have caused the noise.

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:07.560
After some time of checking everywhere, they
still couldn't find the source.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.369
They go back to bed and continue to share
an intimate moment until they fall asleep.The

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:16.979
following day, smoke fills the air just outside
their houseâ€”two cars collided just in front

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.329
of their yard.

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:19.939
C was the other driver.

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:23.870
The car is completely smashed as his lifeless
body sits still in the car while they wait

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:25.070
for help.

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.330
At the hospital, a doctor accompanies M to
the room where her now late husband is.

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.750
M seems to have an underwhelming reaction
as the doctor reveals the sheet to her.

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.039
Everything seems to be a shock to her still.

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:40.180
The doctor leaves the room to give her some
privacy and space to grieve C's passing.

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:45.679
She stares at her husband, covers his body,
and then leaves.After several minutes, C awakens

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:46.890
as a ghost.

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.539
Based on his demeanour, he seems confused
as to why he is there.

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:55.030
He wanders around the hospital from his room,
still covered in the sheet, but no one notices

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.030
him.

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.500
He walks by different rooms and different
people, but he remains invisible to them.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.549
Near the exit, a door of light takes form
and opens up before him.

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:08.289
He shows no interest in the door and stares
at it, so it closes.

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:12.269
He continues to wander and walk for miles
until he arrives at their home.

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:16.159
He enters the house and goes to different
rooms to observe and look around.

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:20.549
In the kitchen, he sees a photograph of him
and his wife as Linda, their realtor, walks

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:21.950
by the window.

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.819
She enters the house, bringing a homemade
dish, and goes around the house like it's

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:26.819
hers.

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:29.220
C just stares at the woman from a corner.

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.200
The woman leaves after leaving a note for
M to call her if she needs anything.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.510
C reads the note and sees M enter the house.

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.349
This is the first time that he has seen her
since the accident.

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:41.540
At this point, M looks extremely sad and not
her true self.

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.250
She goes through letters sent to her and decides
to eat the pie from Linda.

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.069
M eats the pie at their kitchen counter and
does it disturbingly.

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:50.580
It seems like her will to live is also out
the window.

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.630
As she eats the pie on the floor, C just looks
at her from a distance.

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.849
After just forcing herself to eat, M runs
to the bathroom to throw up.

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:03.840
Without C, the house feels incredibly dull
and empty as his music used to fill the air.

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.730
M looks at their bed in their room and hugs
the sheets that still have C's scent.

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.709
She cries, and C starts to console her by
touching her shoulder.

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:14.659
But this is ineffective because he is invisible
to her.

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:19.030
Eventually, she cries herself to sleep, and
C is just watching over her.

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.159
The next day, he looks through the window
and sees another ghost next door, also covered

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:24.299
in a sheet.

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:26.260
M wakes up to watch the rain outside.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.050
After, she cleans the house, changes the bedsheets,
and gets ready to go out.

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:35.430
Days go by, and C just watches her longingly
whenever she walks out the door.

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.209
He lingers around the home and reminisces
memories of when he was alive.

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:42.970
He sits at their bed and decides to take a
look at the other ghost again.

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.329
This time, it waves at him, and he returns
the gesture.

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:50.580
Somehow, both of them can communicate without
the use of words or signs.

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.819
The neighbour ghost says that he is waiting
for someone; C asks who it replies by saying

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:59.299
that it does not remember who it's waiting
for.One night, C is sitting on the living

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:00.530
room couch.

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.549
Suddenly, M arrives with a man, whom she hugs
and kisses.

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:06.549
She welcomes the man inside.

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:09.640
Even as a ghost, C feels a sense of jealousy.

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.890
Because of this, he controls the lights to
turn it on and off.

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:16.250
He also hurls books from the shelf, leaving
M clueless.

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:21.470
She browses through the pages and sees relatable
phrases that have an impact on her experiences.

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.780
M remembers a flashback of when C used to
make her listen to his songs and compositions.

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.810
On the floor, she listens to the music intently
and longs for him even more.

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:34.520
The memory of her listening to the song for
the first time is very much vivid in her mind.M

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.600
decides to move out and puts their belongings
in boxes while movers arrive.

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.920
The whole house is about to be empty, and
C patiently follows her around while she arranges

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:43.930
things.

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:45.960
She paints the walls a brighter colour.

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.820
The refraction of light that C noticed before
appears by the doorway.

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.100
She comes closer to take a better look.

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:56.270
Just like what she told C, before leaving,
she writes a short note and securely hides

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:57.420
it in the wall's gap.

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:00.270
M takes a final look at the house and leaves.

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:04.950
C stays behind and sees her leave the place
they both called home for a considerable time.

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:09.260
While driving away, M seems ready to build
a new life without her partner, but sadness

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:10.750
still fills her eyes.

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:14.910
Now alone in the house, C tries to pick at
the gap where M left the note.

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:19.130
But all of a sudden, two children enter the
house, and this catches his attention.

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:21.370
He tries to follow the children around.

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:24.090
A family moves and settles into the house.

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:29.840
C watches them share meals, talk, play the
piano, and celebrate Christmas as one happy

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:30.840
family.

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:34.400
There is too much going on at the house compared
to when M was the only one living there.

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.450
This makes C move around more.

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:41.040
Eventually, he becomes more agitated; the
children start to sense his presence and grow

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.520
scared of him.

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.230
One night, the young boy wakes up from a noise
coming from the closet.

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:48.780
He wakes his sister up as well for comfort.

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:52.270
C scares them by opening the closet door and
revealing himself.

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:56.900
However, the young boy points a toy gun at
him, acting like he is not scared.

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:01.130
C scares the family once again when one night,
he sees a family portrait of them and knocks

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:02.130
it.

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:05.800
The frame's glass got broken, but the family
continues to have their meal.

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:10.560
Unsatisfied with their reaction, C lifts a
glass of milk and throws it on the floor.

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:13.610
The mother is shocked to witness the hovering
of the glass.

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:16.810
He carries on with throwing plates around
the house out of anger.

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:20.780
The lights start to flicker as the family
watches in panic and confusion.

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:24.430
After the paranormal incident, the mother
cleans up the kitchenâ€”putting the broken

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:25.970
plates in a box.

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:30.110
Eventually, the family moves out, leaving
C all alone again.

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:34.030
He still tries to scratch and picks the gap
where M left the note but fails.

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:36.770
He comes to the window and sees the other
ghost next door.

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:39.440
It is sitting by the window, looking like
it's waiting for someone.

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:45.100
It asks C who's with him, and he replies that
he is alone in the house.Time passes by, and

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:47.250
new occupants vacate the house.

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:51.860
They throw a party, and the number of people
present and the noise overwhelms C. He moves

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:54.800
around to check on people and the things that
they do.

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:58.140
Almost all the people at the party are drunk
as C just observes them.

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:02.820
He listens to a conversation between middle-aged
men and women who are talking about God.

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:06.960
One of them explains that pieces of the past
will remain forever, including Beethoven's

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:11.550
symphonies, the end of the world, and the
memories that people leave behind after death.

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:16.610
The man's words create an impact on C. He
listens attentively to their conversation.

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:20.860
The man then describes theBig Crunchtheory,
concluding that the entire universe will surely

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:23.160
collapse back into a singularity.

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:25.740
The partygoers notice the lights flickering.

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:31.430
When C starts feeling strong emotions, he
can scare people, which is the nature of ghosts.Again,

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:32.970
occupants move out.

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:35.880
The house is now abandoned and in ruins.

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:39.640
After all this time, C is still trying to
get hold of the note that M left in the gap

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:40.860
in the wall.

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:44.930
He finally manages to get the note out of
the wall, but just as he does, bulldozers

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:48.740
arrive and start to level the house, along
with the one next door.

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:52.190
The house is now being demolished to pieces
while C watches.

00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:56.140
For the first time, C and the ghost next door
see the outside world.

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:59.760
They look at each other atop the wood and
rubble of their former homes, clueless about

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:01.370
what will happen next.

00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:04.910
The ghost next door realizes that there is
nothing left to do.

00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:09.260
It tells C that "they are not coming back",
instantly, it vanishes under the sheet, which

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:13.590
crumples to the ground.A big construction
project takes over the house.

00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:17.250
C watches as the skyscraper is built where
his house once stood.

00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:20.060
He walks around the building, seemingly lost.

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:23.640
It is now a corporate building with multiple
offices inside.

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:26.510
He just observes people going about their
day at work.

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:29.640
He heads to the rooftop that overlooks a great
cityscape.

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:34.250
The area once filled with trees in the middle
of nowhere is now futuristic and modern.

00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:37.069
C gets on the ledge and decides to jump.

00:08:37.069 --> 00:08:39.930
After his fall, he finds himself in an empty
field.

00:08:39.930 --> 00:08:43.789
A man is staking out a claim on which piece
of land to build a house.

00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:47.600
A family arrives on a carriage and settles
at the place while their house is about to

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:49.339
start construction.

00:08:49.339 --> 00:08:53.680
C watches the family's young daughter after
she hums one of his song compositions.

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:57.690
The young girl writes a note on a piece of
paper and hides it under a rock.

00:08:57.690 --> 00:09:00.399
This gives C an all too familiar feeling.

00:09:00.399 --> 00:09:04.160
Because he is in a different era, the family
dies after an attack.

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:09.350
C just sits and watches their corpses decay
over time, causing fields to grow over them.All

00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:12.750
of a sudden, C is inside their original house
again.

00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:16.470
His living self and his wife arrive at the
house with the real estate agent.

00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:20.720
He asks the agent about the piano, which she
says has "it has always been here."

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:24.220
The living C takes a look around the house
and gets a weird feeling.

00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:27.830
As the ghost of C watches the couple when
they move in, he sees the moments that the

00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:29.660
living C and M share.

00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:33.470
He also senses tension in the marriage because
the wife wants to move out, but the husband

00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:34.990
is hooked to the place.

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:39.800
The night before his death, the living C tells
M that he is now willing to move elsewhere.

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:43.870
The ghost of C sits at the piano, striking
the keys that cause the noise that startled

00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:45.520
the couple in the beginning.

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:49.250
He sits in sadness after slightly getting
a glimpse of his past and how he could have

00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:50.950
been a better husband.

00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:54.930
C once again gets a look at his ghost, watching
M leave the house for good.

00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:58.529
He approaches the wall and finally gets the
note without any struggle.

00:09:58.529 --> 00:10:02.959
As he is about to open the note, the sheet
crumples to the floor, and just like that,

00:10:02.959 --> 00:10:09.679
C vanishes into thin air.
