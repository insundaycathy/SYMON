00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.120
Welcome to Slash Forward. In this episode we’ll&nbsp;
be looking at the final film in the Saw series,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:18.560
Jigsaw, and assessing a final set of John Kramer’s&nbsp;
traps. How are these going to stack up to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.960
others? Let’s start by unpacking the storyline&nbsp;
to see what we can learn. Let’s get to it.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.600
We open at the end of a high speed chase.&nbsp;
The suspect dips and bails, running to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:32.800
rooftop of a nearby building searching for&nbsp;
an X. He holds off the bloodthirsty officers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.440
by informing them that if they don’t summon&nbsp;
Detective Halloran within seventeen minutes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.400
five people are going to die. Halloran gets&nbsp;
there and, despite a familiarity between the men,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.400
he can’t help but to try to force the&nbsp;
information from him. With talks breaking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.600
down, Edgar chooses to favor his own life,&nbsp;
triggering the device and starting our games.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.520
We then transition, coincidentally,&nbsp;
to five strangers wearing bucket hats,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.320
waking up in what appears to be a high-rent&nbsp;
industrial complex and chained to a cutting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.800
wall. A familiar voice whispers over the PA&nbsp;
that this group is being offered the chance&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:10.320
to cleanse themselves of their filthy lies. If&nbsp;
they give blood, their lights will go green and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.160
they’ll be allowed to move on. With no further&nbsp;
explanation, they get dragged in toward the wall.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.960
Anna is the first to comprehend the situation,&nbsp;
and ends up squirtin all over the floor,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.560
which releases her magical bucket.&nbsp;
Once the recognition settles in,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.720
they all get to work, but Carly ends up&nbsp;
giving a bit too much as a result of her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.560
struggling against it. The unfortunate&nbsp;
sleeper never got the memo, and we get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.200
an uncharacteristic off-screen death as the&nbsp;
rest of them are pulled into the next room.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.680
At the hospital, the detectives puzzle over&nbsp;
why nothing happened when Edgar pulled that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.280
trigger. And with an overzealous officer&nbsp;
putting a bullet right next to his heart,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.760
he won’t be giving any answers for a while&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.240
or possibly ever. So they hit the streets&nbsp;
to shake down any of his known associates.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.400
Back at the kill shack they try to work some&nbsp;
things out and figure out what up. Anna the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:03.840
optimist points out that there’s an advantage&nbsp;
that they’re playing a game That’s the spirit.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.680
Meanwhile, in the broader world, we get a&nbsp;
cool reveal that these games will impose&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.560
themselves on the public. And, thereby, leave&nbsp;
behind evidence to track. Halloran then rolls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.280
up on Logan, the badass coroner. He and&nbsp;
Elle use their special handheld plasma&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.440
cutters purchased specifically to propel&nbsp;
their department into the 21st century,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.720
and find an entire cross section of ya boi’s&nbsp;
head missing. We then learn that the present&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.600
here is ten years post John Kramer. So,&nbsp;
in technological terms, anything goes.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.960
Detective Hunt then rolls in and we&nbsp;
learn this trio has an interwoven&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:39.120
series of histories together. But we can’t get&nbsp;
into details, because Logan pulls a piece of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.760
evidence confirming this man was intended&nbsp;
to die. They find on the usb drive an audio&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:49.280
message charging them with ensuring that various&nbsp;
sins against the innocent are atoned for. Got it.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:56.320
At the shack, demon Billy rolls out with a simple&nbsp;
message and we are treated to some delightfully&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:00.800
appropriate comic relief. Before they can do any&nbsp;
real reconnaissance, the chains start up again so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:05.280
they all start blurting out whatever they think&nbsp;
may be their most shameful transgressions with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.560
no clear impact. Luckily, Mitch notices a tape&nbsp;
before it’s too late. Just grabbing it disengages&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.880
the pulleys, but they’re horrified to discover&nbsp;
the next stage disappears into the ceiling.

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.680
The tape reveals one of them to be a filthy&nbsp;
purse snatcher. The culprit must fess up and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.520
play the old pick a needle carnival game,&nbsp;
with the options being saline solution,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:28.640
acid or the antidote to the poison they were&nbsp;
injected with. Carly gets noticeably stressed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.120
by this, allowing Ryan to easily out her.&nbsp;
He tries to force them into her when she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:39.360
recognizes a number on one syringe that is the&nbsp;
equivalent of her score from the robbery, $3.53.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.680
Despite this connection, she refuses to&nbsp;
choose, and they all begin to get yanked&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.320
on by their necks. Ryan is determined to save&nbsp;
this, however, and swings over to hit her with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:53.360
all three syringes at once, releasing their&nbsp;
necks while ensuring her demise. Sure enough,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.760
shortly after falling to the floor below, she&nbsp;
begins to leak to death from the ears and eyes.

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.880
Anna is beside herself about his actions, but they&nbsp;
are alive and when they check the special syringe,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.520
there is what appears to be a combination to&nbsp;
the door lock. So, there is some balance here.

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:12.080
Meanwhile, we learn that they used the dental&nbsp;
records to ID the bucket vic. He was a bad&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.640
man who owed some money to the wrong people,&nbsp;
resulting in his wife getting killed. Also,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:22.640
the recording is confirmed to be John Kramer.&nbsp;
So nooowww, they start taking this seriously.

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:27.200
Back at the farm, the combo works, allowing&nbsp;
them to pass into a colonial farmhouse set.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.760
They chat a bit to figure out what makes them all&nbsp;
bad, and Anna has a hard time with this, claiming&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:38.880
her husband was the one responsible. Then Ryan&nbsp;
hits his limit and tries to smash his way out,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.440
falling into a trap that wires up his calf&nbsp;
and slowly tightens down on him. Nearby there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:48.000
is a tape. Mitch takes his time, trying to get&nbsp;
this right, but the pulleys go back and forth,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.240
increasing the risk. Despite this, he&nbsp;
reaches in very slowly and retrieves it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:57.120
The message admonishes the trapster for trying&nbsp;
to take a shortcut, and recommends the handle.

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.680
Back with forensics, Elle notes the distinct&nbsp;
presence of trace amounts of animal fecal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.440
matter on the victim’s body. Then they learn&nbsp;
there is another body, from the same group,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.920
but with no clear connection to the first victim&nbsp;
otherwise. She has the mark of Jigsaw as well,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:14.640
and it gets them all tingly inside. As the&nbsp;
detectives share some backstory, Hunt confirms&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:19.440
that Logan had been tortured in Fallujah, which&nbsp;
causes Halloran to wonder about his mental state.

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.480
Back home on the farm, the way is&nbsp;
revealed to them. Anna and Mitch&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:26.320
enter the silo and use teamwork to get&nbsp;
the remote, which also prevents their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.880
escape before the door closes. Both groups&nbsp;
have a TV where Billy again critiques their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:35.120
selfishness and segues this into the next&nbsp;
twist of the challenge - Ryan has to pull&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:39.600
the lever in order to save them. They then&nbsp;
get to watch each other sort it all out.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:44.480
While that’s going on, Halloran decides to feel&nbsp;
things out, charming Elle with a little casual,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:48.080
sexual banter in the workplace.&nbsp;
This makes his question about her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:51.120
whereabouts when the victim was&nbsp;
murdered positively refreshing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:55.120
Then he confides with Logan that there&nbsp;
is a dark web forum for Jigsaw freaks,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:59.120
and there were a lot of IP hits to the website&nbsp;
from their internal system. They’re trying to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:03.200
get something concrete on Elle, but then their&nbsp;
labs come in and they have to run. They learn&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:08.080
that the blood under the victim’s fingernails&nbsp;
match that of John Kramer’s, a true mystery.

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:12.800
This gives enough time for the silo to start&nbsp;
filling up, but Ryan has settled on just staying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:17.920
put for now. The grain does stop, but then they’re&nbsp;
forced to play human battleship with sharp,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:25.600
metal objects. Anna points out that if they die,&nbsp;
Ryan is definitely going to die, which motivates&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:30.720
him to go ahead and yank that lever, severing&nbsp;
his leg but also opening multiple doors for them.

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:35.600
As the sun goes down, and their shifts come to&nbsp;
an end, Logan finds his assistant at her favorite&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:40.560
bar. Through a bit of talking, he discovers her&nbsp;
alibi was bogus, and she lied because she has a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:44.960
hobby that makes her seem a likely suspect.&nbsp;
He convinces her to show him, so she takes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:49.360
him to her secret studio, with Hunt following&nbsp;
close behind. We see that this is where she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:55.040
goes to unwind and burn off her creative energies,&nbsp;
recreating John’s most beautiful contraptions. She&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:59.920
even has a rare one that was discovered via his&nbsp;
schematics, but wasn’t known to have been used.

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:04.800
They discuss this as Hunt takes some photos with&nbsp;
his old ass camera, while Edgar is woken up by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:10.000
an injection to his IV and as Ryan screams over&nbsp;
the loss of his favorite shinbone. As we enter a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.320
new day, Logan wakes up with Elle and shows off&nbsp;
his nasty back scars from torture. And we get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:18.320
all caught up with new developments as Hunt is&nbsp;
sent off to fulfill the commissioner’s request&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:22.960
to ensure John Kramer is dead while Halloran&nbsp;
learns of Edgar’s disappearance overnight.

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:27.440
At the barn, a tractor comes on. A closer&nbsp;
inspection reveals a tape that’s just for Mitch.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:31.360
He then gets pulled upward as the tape&nbsp;
informs us that his sin was lying about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:35.200
the condition of his bike on cycletrader.&nbsp;
Now he will have to get to the motorcycle&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:38.800
brake handle without getting himself&nbsp;
juiced. Fed up with fear and doubt,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:43.360
Anna Lara Crofts her way over to the blender,&nbsp;
but initially only provides encouragement.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:47.280
When that fails, she jams up the wheel&nbsp;
for a bit so Mitch can continue to fail&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:51.680
even under easier circumstances, which&nbsp;
leads to him getting chewed up and spit out.

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:56.080
Meanwhile, Hunt is on scene at the cemetery,&nbsp;
ready to open the casket to rub it in these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.080 --> 00:08:01.280
reporters’ faces, except the casket contains&nbsp;
Edgar. With that turnabout putting them on edge,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:05.760
they positively burst into Elle’s studio&nbsp;
where they quickly find a secret room&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:10.560
where she keeps all her best Jigsaw&nbsp;
tchotchkes, including Mitch’s body.

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:15.120
Hunt goes for Logan, his old pal, and&nbsp;
Logan is very cooperative in terms of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:19.600
casting aspersions at Halloran. This ends&nbsp;
up working pretty well, because Hunt is IA&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:24.560
and has been investigating Halloran for some&nbsp;
time for non-serial killer related offenses. By&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:29.200
releasing Logan, Hunt is afforded the opportunity&nbsp;
to collect additional evidence from Edgar’s body,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:33.520
including confirmation that the slug that&nbsp;
killed him likely came from Halloran’s gun.

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:36.720
Back at home, Logan gets a spooky&nbsp;
drop in from Elle, but it turns&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:41.280
out her awkwardness is just excitement,&nbsp;
because she’s located the game...somehow.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:44.720
But since Halloran is their suspect,&nbsp;
they can’t call the cops. Plus,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:49.680
she has a huge gun so he won’t stand a&nbsp;
chance. Unfortunately, he’s following them.

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:54.240
At the farm, Anna is trying to work through the&nbsp;
next door. She pops it open, then squeezes her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:58.720
way in and pays for it. When she wakes up, she&nbsp;
finds herself chained in a new room with Ryan&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:03.440
and their abductor - the real John Kramer,&nbsp;
here to administer one final test for them.

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:07.840
Here we have a huge info dump revealing&nbsp;
that Ryan was tangentially responsible for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:12.640
three deaths he never fessed up to, John’s&nbsp;
misfortune was primarily the result of his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:17.840
advanced cancer going unnoticed due to a mixed&nbsp;
up chart, and he and Anna used to be neighbors.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:21.840
From the sounds of her frustration next&nbsp;
door, John surmised that Anna killed her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:26.560
baby in a moment of delirious exhaustion and&nbsp;
set it up like her husband did it on accident.

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:30.880
Elle and Logan then pull up to Tuck’s&nbsp;
pig farm, the birthright of Jill Tuck,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:36.640
closed down due to a transmittable disease that&nbsp;
Elle matched to the traces of animal fecal matter,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:41.840
because ya girl knows her shit! They head in right&nbsp;
as Halloran rolls up and screens Hunt’s call.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:45.760
He had wanted to check in with him about&nbsp;
the flesh puzzle they found in his ice box.

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:49.120
John puts the finishing touches on the set&nbsp;
up. After letting them know they’ve got it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:53.840
all backwards, and that the shell is their key&nbsp;
to freedom, we see the game only consists of a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:57.600
shotgun in the middle of the room. That other&nbsp;
stuff was for something else he’s working on.

00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:01.520
Meanwhile the others have been working their way&nbsp;
through and arrive at that one unique trap. This&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:06.000
causes Logan to become suspicious, but before&nbsp;
she can convince him otherwise, Halloran pops&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.400
in and takes control of the situation. Logan&nbsp;
gets cute, but a pipe wrench evens that out.

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:12.880
As the survivors try to&nbsp;
work out what it all means,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:18.000
Anna takes it to be a mandate to kill Ryan&nbsp;
to set the scales of justice back on balance.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.840
But they’ve been doing things backwards,&nbsp;
and a trick shot rips her face off.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:29.280
Inside the shell? the way out. Proving, once&nbsp;
again, that Jigsaw is a master riddler. Er, wait?

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:34.400
Elsewhere, someone monkey shines Halloran, then&nbsp;
he and Logan wake up with some very fashionable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:38.960
collars. They’re ordered to confess the reason&nbsp;
they deserve to die in order to be released.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:43.680
This one’s a direct feedback as John is&nbsp;
all ears. They pull up, family feud style,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:47.920
and Halloran volunteers Logan, although I’m&nbsp;
not sure that gains him anything. He then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:52.080
confesses that he was the one who messed&nbsp;
up John’s charts all those years ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:56.080
Despite this admission, the lasers turn&nbsp;
inward. Well, hopefully he learned something.

00:10:56.080 --> 00:11:00.080
When Halloran gets his turn, there’s just&nbsp;
too much to choose from, so he lists it all.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:03.280
Somehow, he hit the correct one,&nbsp;
because his collar seems to turn&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:07.520
off. But then Logan arises and we find out&nbsp;
this was all a contrivance to get Halloran&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:12.320
to admit that he killed innocent people on&nbsp;
tape so Logan can blame all of this on him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:16.560
The games that we watched occurred ten&nbsp;
years prior when John was still alive.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:21.520
Logan was the sleepy fellow from the opening&nbsp;
about whom John had a change of heart. He then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:26.400
nursed him back to health, obligating him to take&nbsp;
on the responsibility of being the next Jigsaw.

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:32.000
He recreated the game with perps we only saw&nbsp;
in death, and that would implicate Halloran,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.320
the man Logan blames for his wife’s murder&nbsp;
by Edgar - an informant kept on the streets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:40.720
due to Halloran’s thirst for being fully&nbsp;
informed. Logan had access to everything&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:44.160
he needed to make it look like John&nbsp;
was alive and set up the frame job.

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:52.400
Through further flashbacks we&nbsp;
learn Logan never acquired wisdom,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:56.320
and that he’s been around from the start,&nbsp;
so we should all like him. Then, with no&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:01.440
consideration for how it fits into the overall&nbsp;
plan, he allows Halloran’s cranium to blossom.

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:04.880
Well, I have a lot of thoughts about that&nbsp;
one, maybe we can get to some of them in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:07.920
our examination of the traps.&nbsp;
Overall, this one looked good,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:12.240
but felt a bit sloppy and I’m not sure it&nbsp;
holds up to any sort of closer examination.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:16.400
You have to go brain-off for this one. But&nbsp;
regardless, let’s figure out how to survive.

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:20.560
We started our journey with the bucket head trap&nbsp;
at the beginning. This is another in the series&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:24.800
that relies on providing limited information.&nbsp;
It appears these things were attached to their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:28.320
neck collars with some magnetic pins?&nbsp;
They also set up in the beginning with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:32.320
the plasma torches that this was potentially&nbsp;
going to utilize some sort of future tech,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:37.600
but we then learned this happened in the past. So,&nbsp;
future tech is out. I do wonder if the magnetic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:41.920
pins could have been disengaged by using the&nbsp;
opposite magnet from one of the other buckets,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:45.280
but I’m not sure you would have vision of&nbsp;
it to be able to make that determination.

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:49.280
Regardless, this is another simple one.&nbsp;
The request was to give blood to move on.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:54.240
The first victim does so, blood falls to the floor&nbsp;
and the saws retract. This is actually possible&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:59.440
with modern technology as there is a safety&nbsp;
saw designed specifically to identify skin to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:04.400
blade contact and react within a fraction of a&nbsp;
second. It’s a very simple design that utilizes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:08.880
electrical signals from the metal of the blade&nbsp;
coming in contact with flesh to jam itself up.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:14.320
It doesn’t even distinguish. As an illustration,&nbsp;
the company uses a hotdog to show how it works.

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:18.640
This means that any of them could have just&nbsp;
barely nicked themselves to stop the saw,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:22.640
and they could’ve done it for all of them,&nbsp;
including the sleeper. This is an easy one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:26.880
to pass through if you have the knowledge and are&nbsp;
willing to give it a try, which is better than the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:31.600
alternative. Realistically, how else could it know&nbsp;
that the right person gave blood, or a sufficient&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:36.720
amount of blood or whatever else. Even if John was&nbsp;
watching, that’s still pretty suspect. First off,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:42.560
the fact that we don’t know if this was just the&nbsp;
game master pulling switches is a fault of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:46.240
shoddy writing. I’m going to take advantage of&nbsp;
that, because if you want to create a scenario&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:51.440
with tension and uncertainty, you have to think&nbsp;
your own way through it as well and communicate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:55.920
that visually to us. Otherwise, it fails to&nbsp;
connect. Further, if John was just watching&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:55.920 --> 00:14:00.240
via a camera and making his own choices about&nbsp;
who made a reasonable sacrifice, wouldn’t it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:04.560
then also be possible to just fake it? Move like&nbsp;
you touched the wall and then cradle your arm and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:09.600
double over like you’re in pain? That seems pretty&nbsp;
lame and non-technological for a Jigsaw game.

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:13.600
Next we found ourselves in the barn, which&nbsp;
started out as one thing, but then transitioned&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:17.760
to another. I don’t know why they didn’t spend&nbsp;
as much time as they could searching around&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:21.440
and trying to acclimate themselves to their&nbsp;
surroundings. When we ultimately do finish&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:25.520
up with an actual trap, we’re presented with&nbsp;
another one that seems poorly thought out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:30.240
Carly is to inject one of three syringes.&nbsp;
The choice of the syringe represents the risk&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:34.800
as it could kill her. But then all their&nbsp;
collars release. How does it know when she’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:38.960
done one? It could be there is a transmitter&nbsp;
that registers a plunger making contact,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:42.800
closing the circuit and sending a release&nbsp;
signal. In that case, a syringe just needs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:46.720
to be emptied rather than injected, and they&nbsp;
can all get out of their collars and spend more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:50.720
time inspecting the clues and trying to figure&nbsp;
which of them is the correct combo to get out.

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:54.720
But, she did also have the problem that she&nbsp;
had been injected with a poison. It wasn’t&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:59.280
just that one syringe killed, but also that she&nbsp;
would passively die if she didn’t cure herself.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:03.200
That’s a simple matter of observation.&nbsp;
Squeeze out a little of each one to test.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:08.160
The acid should be easy to identify. The other&nbsp;
two are either saline or antidote, so you could&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:13.120
potentially do a small sniff or taste test to&nbsp;
confirm, then stick that sucker in and live.

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:17.200
The next room felt really contrived, which is&nbsp;
saying a lot. It starts with the porch trap&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:21.920
that locks up Ryan’s leg. This is a contingent&nbsp;
trap. It requires someone to attempt to break&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:26.000
the rules in order to become ensnared. I&nbsp;
do really question why he didn’t try to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.240
quickly pull his leg out when the trap reversed&nbsp;
momentarily, but maybe that was just a surprise.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:34.080
Regardless, it seems like there could be an&nbsp;
implement in here somewhere that could help them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:37.840
pull this thing apart or keep it from&nbsp;
moving. The pulleys had holes in them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:41.840
The wires chopped up the wooden handle, but what&nbsp;
if something more sturdy had been crammed through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:47.040
the holes. Without the chance to gain momentum,&nbsp;
this likely would have had a better effect.

00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:51.040
But it also leads me to wonder, what would have&nbsp;
happened if no one had stepped into it? Or if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:55.920
he had just sucked it up and pulled the lever?&nbsp;
It was the thing that ended the other game that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:55.920 --> 00:16:00.800
got initiated, but that success was completely&nbsp;
contingent on this secondary event that may have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:05.520
never happened or still been underway. Seems like&nbsp;
an odd choice for setting up a trap. Without that,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:10.000
I’m not sure the silo trap is survivable. The&nbsp;
grain part is horrifying, but then it stopped&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.274
while they still had their heads up. The grain is&nbsp;
more terrifying than the sharp objects falling.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:11.274 --> 00:16:14.560
And, since they weren’t buried, they likely&nbsp;
could have avoided the sharp objects by just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:18.480
swimming over to the side of the silo where&nbsp;
the space above them is covered by the TV.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:23.520
This would provide some protection and safety, but&nbsp;
survivability from there is uncertain sans lever.

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:30.560
The next disappointing trap is the motorcycle&nbsp;
blender. This one is confounding. It seems like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:35.280
a trap that could have easily gone wrong at any&nbsp;
initial step, and resulted in not stringing Mitch&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:39.760
up by his ankle. If everything goes to plan,&nbsp;
you probably do need another person nearby,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:44.640
which he had in Anna, and she had the right&nbsp;
idea. The motorcycle gear was fairly thin,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:48.240
and it makes sense to try to knock it off&nbsp;
the rail or get it to stop or get crammed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:52.320
up in some other way. Possibly there is a&nbsp;
control box or wiring nearby that was used&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:56.880
for the remote start? It’s not clear.&nbsp;
The primary factor preventing success&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:56.880 --> 00:17:01.840
is with Mitch’s well-established habit of&nbsp;
reaching for things really, really slowly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:05.760
even when he’s really close to reaching it. He&nbsp;
did it with the tape player and does it again here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:10.080
with the brake lever. Take nothing for granted.&nbsp;
Just because the trap momentarily stopped,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:14.960
don’t presume it will stay stopped. Also, don’t&nbsp;
move, and make yourself as thin as possible. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:19.040
wasn’t reaching any further at the end than&nbsp;
he had been just before, but he got chunked&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:23.440
up when the machine came back on. Why would that&nbsp;
be, unless he used his moment of pause to stretch&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:28.400
out and puff himself up a bit. Huge mistake, as&nbsp;
illustrated by the actual outcome in the movie.

00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:32.640
The last two obstacles are barely worth calling&nbsp;
traps, and we won’t spend too long discussing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:36.800
them. The shotgun was more of a riddle than a&nbsp;
trap. This speaks to the rule we established&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:41.440
in another video of, if nothing’s happening,&nbsp;
do nothing. There’s no timer, John just left,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:45.600
you’re just chained up. Why the sudden urgency&nbsp;
to take action and start bustin? If there are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:49.600
trust issues with leaving the gun there, you&nbsp;
could disarm the gun. This will give time for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:54.400
quiet contemplation without worry or distraction,&nbsp;
and could even lead you to inadvertently figure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:58.400
out the clues completely on accident. Really,&nbsp;
you just have to keep your head on straight. If&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:03.120
you’re both there for killing people, why would&nbsp;
John want you to rectify that by killing people?

00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:07.440
And then the laser collars. This is a bit&nbsp;
of sci-fi fantasy here, but an interesting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:11.600
concept. This was a retributive trap, meant to&nbsp;
kill. And while you’re attached to the wall,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:15.520
the perpetrator is right there. Therefore,&nbsp;
there are very few options open to you. If&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:18.880
the circumstances were different, and we&nbsp;
were just dealing with the collar itself,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:23.280
it seems the weakest part here is it’s frailty.&nbsp;
You have these little knobs here turning around&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:26.960
and pointing lasers all over. I’d start by&nbsp;
just twisting on each of them and stripping&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:31.840
out the gears that control their motion. The only&nbsp;
true equivalent we have for judging future tech&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:36.160
is Sharper Image. If they’re anything like&nbsp;
every item ever sold through Sharper Image,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:40.880
their construction is likely as delicate as a&nbsp;
baby bird. Just break them and let them dangle.

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:46.160
Well then, that was a lot of traps over time.&nbsp;
TOT. I hope a lot of lessons were tucked away&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:50.560
for later. The quest for learning how to beat&nbsp;
various horrendous situations marches on,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:54.960
but likely with fewer opportunities to&nbsp;
directly address these types of elaborate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:58.400
dangers. Until the next episode, I&nbsp;
hope this knowledge serves you well.

00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:09.840
Before we go, I’d like to give a huge thanks to&nbsp;
my donors, memorialized in the hall of headshots.

00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:17.440
