onto the ground without landing on the safety&nbsp;
caution his entire life flashes before his eyes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:42.080
but surprisingly the man is able to wake up after&nbsp;
saving the little girl room being killed he gets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:50.240
up and rushes towards the girl's family trying to&nbsp;
see if the victim is hurt but no matter how hard&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:57.760
he talks no one seems to be responding suddenly he&nbsp;
hears a voice calling his name from offer and sees&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:05.040
two people in suits smiling towards him amidst the&nbsp;
chow hong tries telling them to step away from the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:11.840
falling debris but soon notices the firefighters&nbsp;
trying to save a man who looks exactly like the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:20.080
main character himself the woman named jun&nbsp;
tells hong that he's paragon before he died and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:26.480
they are here to assist him through the seven&nbsp;
trials of judgments the other guardian called&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:33.440
mack tells him that their leader is waiting for&nbsp;
them before the gets towards the trials and they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:40.800
have to go there right now hong has trouble taking&nbsp;
all his information in and slowly walks away while&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:48.240
looking at his comrades moaning over his dead body&nbsp;
he screams that he can't die right now as he wants&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:54.960
to see his mother but the man's body begins&nbsp;
levitating in the air towards the joint portal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:02.640
hong continues shouting about seeing his mother&nbsp;
while the guardians are tortures that he is so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:10.000
caring towards his parents even after death they&nbsp;
arrive in different dimension where thousands of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.560
people are heeding towards the guest of judgement&nbsp;
and home meets the guardian leader called rim&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:23.760
who's helped 47 souls to reincarnate in the past&nbsp;
century when the leader congratulates hong for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:31.280
being a paragon the man looks away and declines&nbsp;
starting that he is not a good person at all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:38.560
they enter through the gates of judgement but&nbsp;
are teleported to a nightmarish place full of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:46.160
lava called the mountain of murder mug is shocked&nbsp;
to see their location and immediately questions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:55.840
hong if he's killed someone in his life but the&nbsp;
man dennis having ever done something so terrible&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:01.440
dim explains that causing someone's death&nbsp;
incredibly true in action is called judged&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:08.800
by the trials which may be the reason that they&nbsp;
are here hong arrives on a stadium where large&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:16.160
doors on the ground opens up revealing a giant pit&nbsp;
field with lava the people who are punished try&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:24.720
desperately to climb out but they continuously&nbsp;
burn inside the sea or flames the prosecutors&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:33.520
begin the trial by accusing hong of not saving on&nbsp;
of his colleagues when he had the chance to do so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:40.400
which eventually led to the man's death the demand&nbsp;
that hong suffers inside the lava pit for five&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:47.440
years in order to atone the scene of not saving&nbsp;
his friend lim defends the man by requesting to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:55.120
closer examine on what really happened at the&nbsp;
incident apparently hong did try to desperately&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:02.560
save his friend at the scene but they couldn't&nbsp;
move the stone that the fire fighter was trapped&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:08.880
under after realizing the hopeless situation his&nbsp;
colleague told him to leave and save the other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:15.760
civilians instead because of hogg's decision&nbsp;
he was able to save eight people that night&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:23.200
reem argues that the man's heroism should be taken&nbsp;
into consideration when judging his decision to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:30.240
leave his friend behind seeing the man's bravery&nbsp;
at helping others the judge decides to exunate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:37.920
him from the charges and allow him to pass on to&nbsp;
the next trials although hong has owned the first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:45.040
hearing he is greatly affected by the reminder of&nbsp;
his colleague's death he demands to know why the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:51.600
guardians are helping him as he doesn't believe&nbsp;
himself to be a paragon it turns out that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:51.600 --> 00:05:00.400
guardians have their own agendas as they made&nbsp;
a deal with the king of hell who's called yamra&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:07.600
if the three are able to help 49 dead souls to&nbsp;
go through the trials and reincarnate within the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:15.440
century they can also become humans as well they&nbsp;
eventually arrive at the trial of indolence where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:22.000
june explains all the levers that hong has&nbsp;
completed the man has never been lazy through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:30.000
out this life and always helped others no matter&nbsp;
where he went this even means knocking over a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:38.480
beehives and subjecting his whole team to terrible&nbsp;
stings or rescuing some grumpy cat on the edge of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:46.320
a building and breaking the owner's lamborghini&nbsp;
with his head the judge was so moved by hong's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:54.320
contributions that she orders the prosecutors to&nbsp;
immediately build a statue in honor of the paragon&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.320 --> 00:06:03.760
however when she inquires about why the man wanted&nbsp;
to live his life so fully hong replied that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:11.680
reason was simply for money upon hearing the man's&nbsp;
answer the judge quickly changes her verdict and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:18.960
tells the prosecutors to send home into the&nbsp;
punishment where a giant machine's chases after&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:26.160
all the people guilty of indolence cursing their&nbsp;
bones and feeding them to the fishes the guardians&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:32.480
try their best to help their defendant and begs&nbsp;
the goddess to look closer at the man's life&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:38.320
the reason hong worked so hard to make money&nbsp;
was because he wanted to support his mother who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:47.600
was sick and his brother who wanted to go to low&nbsp;
school hong worked so much that he often disregard&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:54.800
his own health and his desire for money is&nbsp;
therefore not due to selfishness after realizing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:54.800 --> 00:07:01.920
the man's true motivations the goddess finds that&nbsp;
home is not guilty as he only wanted to help his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:09.840
family the group quickly bought the boat that will&nbsp;
take them to the next location but before they can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:17.600
celebrate they notice that they are being pursued&nbsp;
by numerous monsters the team unleashes their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:24.320
weapon and trials their best to defend against&nbsp;
the creatures they are able to defeat many of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:30.640
enemies by cutting them into pieces but the&nbsp;
captain eventually gets knocked over the ship&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:37.920
and barely hangs on mack is forced to defend&nbsp;
the ship all by himself while giving his leader&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:44.960
the chance to recover in the family moment max&nbsp;
strikes a large stone pillar that causes the rocks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:52.480
to fall finally saving them from the monster's&nbsp;
pursuit the man explains that this can only happen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:52.480 --> 00:08:00.320
because a family of hong has died and became a&nbsp;
vengeful spirit in order to stop other monsters&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:07.760
from pursuing them in the future rim decides to&nbsp;
visit hong's family in order to find out the truth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:15.600
about what happened he goes to hogs resident and&nbsp;
notices that the mother is clearly alive this can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:24.320
only mean that it was the brother so who died and&nbsp;
turned into a vengeful spirit the evil aura tries&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:30.960
to run away while the guardian chases closely&nbsp;
behind rim tries to stop the spirit by catching&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:39.040
it using his weapon but the ghost managed to avoid&nbsp;
the attacks from behind the two eventually clashes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:46.160
together and knocks the guardian away allowing&nbsp;
the spirit to disappear as rim looks disparately&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:54.400
for his prey the guardian follows the trial to a&nbsp;
military base where he noticed the soldier talking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:54.400 --> 00:09:02.400
about so and referring to him as a disaster what's&nbsp;
even more curious is that the captain and one of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:10.080
his fellow soldiers is clearly hiding something&nbsp;
ream these glasses as a colonel of the army and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:17.840
proceeds to question the captain about so accusing&nbsp;
him of killing the man surprisingly the captain&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:24.000
begins blackmailing the guardian out of fear which&nbsp;
further confirms that he is responsible for the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:31.840
brother's death on the other side hong is being&nbsp;
questioned by the goddess of deceit and accused&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:39.040
of writing numerous false wills and test diamonds&nbsp;
for his colleague which he failed to save earlier&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:46.320
he gave this writings to the man's daughter lying&nbsp;
to her by pretending to be the girl's father&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:54.080
the goddess immediately orders the man to be tied&nbsp;
up and prepares to punish him by cutting off his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:54.080 --> 00:10:02.160
tongue luckily reem is able to connect to his team&nbsp;
through telepathy and argus for hong's actions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:10.320
it turns out that he also wrote false letters to&nbsp;
his mother lying about how great his life is and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:18.080
how wealthy he became reem argues that these&nbsp;
are all attempts to comfort the people that he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:24.880
cares about by providing them hope that really&nbsp;
can't offer and allowing them to live on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:33.680
upon realizing that hong did all this in order&nbsp;
to provide others a reason to live on the deity&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:42.080
forgives the man's crimes as the intentions were&nbsp;
never to harm after the trial riem lies to hong&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:51.760
and tells him that his families are doing fine but&nbsp;
quickly informs the team about the truth regarding&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:59.280
hong's brother dream goes back in time to see&nbsp;
what really happened on the off night sue's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:07.200
death and realizes that his comrade dong shot the&nbsp;
man by accident after switching off the safety&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:12.960
dong called their captain right away and instead&nbsp;
of trying to save the dying man the soldier&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:21.120
decides to bury sue and hide the evidence so that&nbsp;
his promotion would not be soiled jim looks at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:28.640
the body of sue and realizes in shock that the man&nbsp;
was actually not dead forcing him to remember the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:35.520
memories from his past where his father was also&nbsp;
buried alive at the same time hong has arrived&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:43.600
the hell of injustice where the people are frozen&nbsp;
for years in order to pay for their crime of not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:50.560
helping others thankfully hong's profession as a&nbsp;
fighter means that he will not be judged here but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:57.760
instead be allowed to move on to the next location&nbsp;
during the ride inside the cable car it's revealed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:05.440
that the guardians all have their memories arrived&nbsp;
except for their leader rim mack tries to stop his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:12.320
teammate for revealing anymore about their&nbsp;
limitations but accidentally informs hong&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:21.040
that his brother is in fact the vengeful spirit&nbsp;
upon realizing the truth the man's unstable psyche&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:27.200
shakes the entire rim and breaks the table&nbsp;
car nearly dropping his guardians below but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:34.320
hong is able to pull himself together in the&nbsp;
last moment and offers to help his teammates&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:41.600
the three eventually arrives in the hill of&nbsp;
betrayal where a beautiful goddess judges the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:48.160
people who betrayed their loved ones by trapping&nbsp;
them in a mirror and shattering the victims&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:55.120
luckily hong was a paragon in his lifetime and&nbsp;
did not betray anyone allowing him to move on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:55.120 --> 00:13:01.920
safely from his location as well at the same&nbsp;
time rim is able to find the vengeful spirit in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:10.000
a night club where he is trying to kill one of&nbsp;
soldiers who buried him alive the guardian chases&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:15.760
after sue right away and they&nbsp;
fight continuously in the air while&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:23.120
flying through the city rim is able to capture the&nbsp;
spirit by setting a trap and trying him onto the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:29.040
building using as a magic group the guardian&nbsp;
tells the spirit that he needs to forgive his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:36.880
killers in order to be reborn or else he will be&nbsp;
destroyed forever but this only served to remind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:44.000
sue about how he was buried alive and betrayed&nbsp;
by his best friends causing him to scream&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:51.280
in rage and break free by creating a massive shock&nbsp;
wave on the other side after drinking numerous&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:59.520
amounts of alcohol dong has decided to give the&nbsp;
location of the body to sue mother unable to bear&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:07.040
with the guilt any longer the woman open the map&nbsp;
and finally sees the location of his youngest son&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:13.520
while sue watches everything from behind&nbsp;
his mother the vengeful spirit goes to him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:19.600
and tells the guardian that he has decided to&nbsp;
forgive dong after seeing the soldier's guild&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:27.520
and how the location of the body was given to&nbsp;
the mother sue begs the guardian to act like a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:34.480
medium so that he may talk to dong for the&nbsp;
last time promising that he will go through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:42.160
the trials afterwards the spirit talks through&nbsp;
the man and tells the soldier that he forgives him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:49.840
and do not waste any more new tears on something&nbsp;
from the past meanwhile hong has reached the hell&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:58.400
of violence and sees a giant hole in which they&nbsp;
must jump into in order to reach the trials the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:05.360
man falls into the massive opening and crashes&nbsp;
into a giant rock but mack is able to catch his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:13.360
teammate and lead beside hong however hong slides&nbsp;
towards the two and knocks them over by accident&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:21.840
causing them to free fall once again towards the&nbsp;
bottom of the pit musk rushes towards the two&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:29.920
while hong is able to grab the girl and tries to&nbsp;
save her from the crash just like before he died&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:37.280
surprisingly their fall is quickly stopped at the&nbsp;
last moment after reaching the bottom the trial&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:44.320
of violence begins and the prosecutors accuse&nbsp;
hong of beating up his brother in high school&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:51.680
this action was especially unforgivable as&nbsp;
the young boy was suffering from malnutrition&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:51.680 --> 00:16:00.160
due to how poor the people was at the time in fact&nbsp;
hong never sought out forgiveness after the fight&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:07.920
as he ran off away from his family the very next&nbsp;
day and never went home ever since the judge&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:15.920
decides quickly that the man is guilty of violence&nbsp;
towards his own family and plans to send him into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:24.320
a pit where people are constantly hit by rocks&nbsp;
as punishment saying that home is about to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:31.200
sentenced june quickly demands the judge to hold&nbsp;
off the conviction and look at the final trial&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:39.280
together with the current one as they are closely&nbsp;
related this play is very risky as it requires the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:47.760
guardians to forfeit their powers in the afterlife&nbsp;
if hong was found to be guilty on the next trial&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:53.680
unfortunately the guardians quickly learned&nbsp;
the truth about what happened on that night&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:53.680 --> 00:17:00.640
of the fight sue woke up after seeing his brother&nbsp;
kneeling before their mom and demands to know what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:09.120
hong was doing but soon finds out that the boy was&nbsp;
trying to kill his own mother using a pillow so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:16.000
tried to stop his brother immediately which caused&nbsp;
hong to eventually drop the pillow and begin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:23.040
punching the young boy continuously with anger&nbsp;
it turns out that hong felt very hopeless&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:30.480
at that time of his life as their family&nbsp;
was so poor and his mother was gravely ill&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:39.040
the only way he believed that can end their&nbsp;
suffering was through death and nothing else this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:45.680
is also why he felt extremely guilty afterwards&nbsp;
and ran away from home never returning to his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:52.400
family ever again after hearing this the guardians&nbsp;
became hopeless as they realized that there is no&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:59.760
way they can win the trials now especially in the&nbsp;
final hell of filial empty at the same time dream&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:08.560

to her son's body the captain of the army says&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:31.040
that the rush is towards the woman ripping her&nbsp;
signs into pieces of pushing her into the ground&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:38.240
causing her to faint in the exertion so sees that&nbsp;
his mother is being attracted by his killer and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:45.440
becomes engulfed in rage quickly turning into the&nbsp;
vengeful spirit that he was before he breaks free&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:53.760
from the restraints and grabs on to the guardian&nbsp;
throwing the man away using tremendous force so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:53.760 --> 00:19:02.240

giant tornado engulfing all the soldiers in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:08.880
