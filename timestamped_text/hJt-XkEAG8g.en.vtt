00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:12.720
Hi guys, Korean Movie Recapped here.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:14.570
Before we start, WARNING!

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:15.740
Spoilers Ahead!

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:21.190
Today, I'm going to recap a 2013 Korean Crime-Thriller
movie called New World.

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:25.949
An undercover police officer goes deep inside
the heart of a Korean crime syndicate.

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.751
When the head of the organization is killed
in a mysterious accident, he is trapped in

00:00:29.751 --> 00:00:31.410
the succession war.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.320
Will he be able to take them down?

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.330
Goldmoon is the biggest crime syndicate in
Korea that operates under the face of a legitimate

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.050
corporate enterprise.

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.080
It runs under the leadership of Chairman Seok,
the man who managed to unite various crime

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.910
clans under Goldmoon.

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.790
He was recently able to escape prosecution
on several charges.

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:55.010
In the process, he realizes that the police
might have a spy inside his organization.

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.850
Ja-sung, a high-ranking player in the organization,
and his men are doing a witch hunt to find

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:00.890
the mole.

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.640
They capture a suspected member and torture
him to get a confession.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.369
They aren't able to get a confession so they
kill him and ditch his body into the ocean

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:09.850
inside a barrel.

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.360
Meanwhile, Chairman Seok is on the way back
from his mistress house.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.220
A truck suddenly appears at an intersection
and rams the car.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.540
The emergency unit manages to arrive on time
and brings Chairman Seok to the hospital.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.580
The news about it quickly spread and the whole
organization gathered at the hospital.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.710
Ja-sung meets with Jong-goo there, one of
the three top leaders under Chairman Seok.

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.880
He then goes to the airport to greet the other
leader, Chung, who just came back from Shanghai.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.620
Chung is a rather eccentric man, but he considers
Ja-sung as his close friend as they have known

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:43.580
each other for a long time.

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.050
On the way to the hospital, Chung gives Ja-sung
a watch as a gift to celebrate his wife's

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:49.210
pregnancy.

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.140
But Ja-sung declines the gift because it's
a knock-off brand and mocks him for buying

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.140
it.

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.521
Being an eccentric person, he lashes his frustration
at his subordinate for telling him that it

00:01:58.521 --> 00:01:59.950
looks real.

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.840
All of the organization leaders have gathered
at the hospital to wait for the operation

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:04.840
result.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.679
The doctors come out from the operation room
and announce that Chairman Seok has passed

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:09.679
away.

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.060
The news makes Jong-goo angry with the doctor
and leaves the others confused as the organization's

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.209
future becomes uncertain.

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:20.640
On the next day, they held a grand funeral
ceremony to give their last respect to Chairman

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:21.640
Seok.

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.490
The police also show up to do surveillance
which angers Jong-goo.

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.190
He confronts them and smashes their camera.

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.890
Chief Kang, a police chief leading the investigation
against Goldmoon, comes to help his subordinate.

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.090
Jong-goo backs out and pays them for the broken
camera.

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.120
Back at the police headquarter, the higher-ups
are discussing the contentious factions vie

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.670
for succession after the death of Chairman
Seok.

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:49.390
Goldmoon is an amalgamation of the Jaebum
Clan, Jeil Clan, and Nothmoon Clan.

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.280
Three candidates will likely fill the open
seat of Goldmoon's new chairman.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.770
The first candidate is Chung, supported by
the Northmoon clan, and has close ties with

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.350
the triads and often manages businesses outside
Korea.

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:06.000
The second candidate is Jong-goo, supported
by the most prominent Jaebum Clan, and was

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.860
close to Chairman Seok.

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.430
These two candidates are the most likely to
fill the vacant seat as they are the most

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.130
influential leaders at the organization.

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.599
The last candidate is Soo-ki, backed by the
Jeil Clan.

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:22.200
But Soo-ki is old, and his power is unlikely
to match the other two candidates.

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.110
The police plan to influence the succession
process to bring them down.

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.660
Ja-sung is playing a board game with an unknown
lady.

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:35.240
He tells her about the upcoming board meeting
held in 2 days to discuss the succession process.

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:39.840
Suddenly he becomes annoyed and heads to an
abandoned building to meet a particular person.

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.290
That person is Chief Kang.

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:46.060
Ja-sung turns out to be an undercover cop
that infiltrates the Goldmoon syndicate, and

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.410
the unknown lady before is his handler.

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:53.060
He has risen through ranks for the past eight
years and has become the 5th rank in command,

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.800
just under the 3 top leaders and Chairman
Seok.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.580
He is mad at Chief Kang because he promised
him that his job would be done once they took

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.360
care of Chairman Seok.

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.500
But his handler told him that now he has to
assist the mission to influence the succession

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:06.750
process.

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:11.000
He is also pissed because somehow Chief Kang
knows that his wife is pregnant and presents

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000
him.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.010
That means that someone is following him without
him knowing.

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.140
He feels frustrated by the situation, but
he has no other choice.

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:22.300
Two days later, they held the board meeting
as planned.

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.099
They decided to fit a voting session next
week to pick the new chairman.

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:30.210
As expected, two opposing factions arise between
Chung and Jong-goo.

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:34.699
Ja-sung is closer to Chung, but he does not
officially support anyone.

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:37.099
He walks back to the car park with Chung.

00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:41.189
Chung tells him that he needs to go back to
Shanghai for business soon and asks him to

00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:45.039
look after his office so Jong-goo can't do
anything while away.

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:48.539
Suddenly, a car appears and almost runs them
over.

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:52.610
It turns out to be Jong-goo, trying to mess
with them and then drives away.

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:57.189
Chung then invites Ja-sung to have a little
feast to celebrate his wife's pregnancy.

00:04:57.189 --> 00:05:00.889
Ja-sung then goes to his handler to relay
more intel.

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:04.849
He asks her about the details of the mission
as his life is in the line, but the handler

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:08.050
can't share the information with him as the
protocol says.

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:11.949
Ja-sung only needs to do as he is told, which
makes him angry.

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:16.300
Even his comrades in the syndicates trust
him more than the fellow police do.

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:20.870
Just before he leaves, he tells her that Chung
will leave the country tomorrow afternoon.

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:25.169
Meanwhile, Jong-goo invites the other leader
to his office and tries to intimidate them

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:26.919
into supporting him.

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:30.340
On the next day, Ja-sung accompanies Chung
to the airport.

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:34.090
He realizes that many undercover cops are
monitoring them there.

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:37.580
He doesn't know what is going to happen, which
makes him nervous.

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:41.759
Just after Chung passes the security gate,
some police officer comes to him and takes

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:42.889
him away.

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:46.499
He meets with Chief Kang in an interrogation
room nearby.

00:05:46.499 --> 00:05:50.430
Chief Kang shows him a file about the Goldmoon
investigation report.

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:54.400
Chang realized that the file includes some
internal data that only can be obtained if

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.839
the police still have some spy inside the
organization.

00:05:57.839 --> 00:06:02.520
But to his surprise, Chief Kang proposes a
plan to take down Jong-goo together so Chung

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:05.319
can easily take the vacant Chairman role.

00:06:05.319 --> 00:06:08.189
Chief Kang tells him to think about it over
his flight.

00:06:08.189 --> 00:06:13.180
Just before Chung leaves, he wonders how the
police know that he will fly to Shanghai today.

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:17.339
On the plane, he tells his lawyer to do a
background check on Chief Kang and hire a

00:06:17.339 --> 00:06:20.869
hitman group to clean the moles inside the
organization.

00:06:20.869 --> 00:06:24.110
After that, Chief Kang takes his men to make
a move.

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:27.830
Jong-goo and his crew are in the middle of
breakfast when suddenly the police barge into

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:29.229
the restaurant.

00:06:29.229 --> 00:06:33.020
Chief Kang shows him the court certified warrant
and takes him away.

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:37.529
Just before they leave, Jong-goo wonders if
Chung has sold him out, which Chief Kang answers

00:06:37.529 --> 00:06:38.599
vaguely.

00:06:38.599 --> 00:06:42.639
Chung receives the news about the arrest and
immediately plans a meeting with Jong-goo

00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:44.650
and flies back to Korea.

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:48.610
When he arrives in Korea, he goes straight
to meet Jong-goo and exchange some heated

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:52.909
conversation which ends with Jon-goo warning
him, But Chung insists that the one leaking

00:06:52.909 --> 00:06:54.830
the information was not him.

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:58.839
Chung then goes to meet with Chief Kang discreetly
in an empty stadion.

00:06:58.839 --> 00:07:02.860
He gives him a box full of mooncakes as a
token of appreciation.

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:06.749
Chief Kang checks the gift and finds bundles
of money inside the mooncake.

00:07:06.749 --> 00:07:10.879
Chung hopes that it can smoothen things up
for his future business with his help.

00:07:10.879 --> 00:07:13.129
He declines it and throws them on the floor.

00:07:13.129 --> 00:07:17.439
Ja-sung brings his wife to an obstetrician
to monitor her pregnancy.

00:07:17.439 --> 00:07:21.159
On the way back, his wife gets a call and
receives it in private.

00:07:21.159 --> 00:07:25.020
It turns out that it's from Chief Kang, asking
her about Ja-sung.

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:28.090
She spies on his husband behind him for Chief
Kang.

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:32.839
Like her husband, she feels that this espionage
mission has put a lot of stress, so she wants

00:07:32.839 --> 00:07:33.960
to quit.

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:37.939
She also feels more loyal to her husband now
since he is the one who helped her out of

00:07:37.939 --> 00:07:39.919
his miserable old life.

00:07:39.919 --> 00:07:44.080
The background check result on Chief Kang
has finally arrived, not only information

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:48.649
about Chief Kang, the Chinese hacker Chung
hired manages to get classified information

00:07:48.649 --> 00:07:50.819
about the whole espionage mission.

00:07:50.819 --> 00:07:52.770
The file he reads shocks Chung.

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:57.069
Meanwhile, the hitman group that Chung employs
has arrived in Korea.

00:07:57.069 --> 00:08:00.830
They are a famous Chinese hitman group called
the Yanbian Hobos.

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:05.249
Ja-sung suddenly calls Chung, asking about
his sudden arrival in Korea.

00:08:05.249 --> 00:08:09.179
Chung acts friendly as usual then tells him
to meet him in a warehouse because he has

00:08:09.179 --> 00:08:10.610
a special surprise.

00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:14.379
Ja-sung has a bad feeling, but he can’t
decline it.

00:08:14.379 --> 00:08:17.080
The Yanbian Hobos make their first move.

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:21.529
From the hacked file, they know the identity
of Ja-sung’s handler and visit her.

00:08:21.529 --> 00:08:25.569
She fights back, but the Yanbian Hobos manages
to get her alive.

00:08:25.569 --> 00:08:30.740
Ja-sung arrives at the warehouse and comes
inside with his trusted subordinate, Suk-mu.

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:34.779
Chung tells him to open a barrel to get the
surprise that Chung promised on the phone

00:08:34.779 --> 00:08:35.779
before.

00:08:35.779 --> 00:08:38.770
Ja-sung cautiously approaches the barrel and
opens it.

00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:43.930
To his surprise, he finds his handler inside,
stripped to her underwear and all bloody.

00:08:43.930 --> 00:08:47.430
Chung explains that the
lady inside the barrel, who Ja-sung routinely

00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:50.630
meets to play chess and relay intel, is a
spy.

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:55.030
Ja-sung sweats heavily as Chung hands him
the mission file with detailed information

00:08:55.030 --> 00:09:00.710
of the involved personnel.

00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:05.640
Chung has one final surprise for him and tells
him to flip the file to the last page.

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:11.280
Just before he manages to read the final page,
Chung grabs a spade and viciously hits Suk-mu.

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:16.070
Unknown to Ja-sung, his most trusted subordinate
in the organization is also an undercover

00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:17.070
cop.

00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:21.090
Chung manages to find all the spies around
Ja-sung and eliminates them as a gift for

00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:22.090
him.

00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:26.230
This confuses Ja-sung because although Chung
has the mission file, somehow he doesn’t

00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:27.930
know his real identity.

00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:32.860
Chung tells the Yanbian Hobos to have some
fun with the handler’s body, making Ja-sung

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:36.990
grab a gun and shoot her to save her from
what the Yanbian Hobos will do to her.

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:40.630
Meanwhile, Chief Kang goes to the prison to
meet Jong-goo.

00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:44.790
He gives Jong-goo photos of Chung and him,
making Jong-goo think that Chung is the one

00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:46.240
who sold him.

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:49.830
Jong-goo then tells his men to do a little
retaliation to Chung.

00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:54.340
On the next day, Ja-sung goes to Chief Kang
to discuss the situation.

00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:58.160
Chief Kang tells him that their system is
hacked, and all of the classified information

00:09:58.160 --> 00:09:59.340
has been leaked.

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:04.350
Ja-sung desperately wants to pull out from
the mission, but suddenly Soo-ki, the organization’s

00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:06.580
third leader, appears.

00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:10.180
Chief Kang has agreed to help him get the
chairman seat so the police can control the

00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:12.350
organization from within.

00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:16.540
Chief Kang threatens to spread Ja-sung’s
identity, making him not have other choices

00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:21.280
besides continuing the plan, although Chief
Kang has promised to pull him out.

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:24.970
Jong-goo’s men make their move and organize
an attack on Chung.

00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:29.280
Despite being outnumbered, he manages to give
the attacker a hard time.

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:32.700
He is trapped inside an elevator full of Jong-goo’s
men.

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:35.890
He takes them down, but it leaves him heavily
injured.

00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:38.420
The police come and bring the wounded to the
hospital.

00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:43.110
Jong-goo’s men also try to get Ja-sung’s
wife, but the police are already waiting for

00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:44.110
them.

00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:47.540
Unfortunately, the shock makes his wife having
a miscarriage.

00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:51.840
The doctor tells Ja-sung that his wife’s
stress level has affected the pregnancy.

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:55.870
Ja-sung hears about what happened to Chung
and goes to the hospital.

00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:57.570
His condition is terrible.

00:10:57.570 --> 00:11:00.770
Chung wants to talk with his best friend for
the last time.

00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:05.340
He tells him to choose a side for his own
good, signaling that he knows Ja-sung’s

00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:06.340
identity.

00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:11.540
Just before Chung passes away, he tells Ja-sung
that he leaves a present in his office safe.

00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:16.250
The organization then held its second funeral
this month, sending off one of the succession

00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:17.250
candidates.

00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:21.200
With Chung’s death and Jong-goo locked in
the prison, Soo-ki succession seems to be

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:22.390
a smooth ride.

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:26.600
Ja-sung goes to Chung’s office and finds
his file inside the safe.

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:31.040
He also finds a watch, a present that Chung
promised, but it is not a knock-off brand

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:32.280
this time.

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:35.510
He realizes that Chung is really his true
best friend.

00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:37.280
But he realizes it too late.

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:42.050
On the voting day, Soo-ki asks Ja-sung to
ride with him to the board meeting.

00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:46.960
But suddenly, they head to a remote location
with a bunch of Soo-ki men surrounding them.

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:52.230
It turns out that Soo-ki plans to betray his
agreement with the police and eliminate Ja-sung.

00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:54.990
But instead of Ja-sung, they beat Soo-ki.

00:11:54.990 --> 00:12:00.040
The absence of Chung and Jong-goo makes Ja-sung
the most influential person in the organization.

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:03.620
Meanwhile, the police released Jong-goo that
day.

00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:07.680
He goes to his office to find out that Ja-sung’s
men are already waiting for him.

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:11.010
They then throw him down the building, eliminating
him.

00:12:11.010 --> 00:12:16.281
Ja-sung also sends the Yanbian Hobo to eradicate
the other leader supporting Soo-ki, and Chief

00:12:16.281 --> 00:12:19.760
Kang, who has repeatedly betrayed his promises.

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:24.020
He is done playing spy for the police, sacrificing
so many things.

00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:28.170
He decides to take his new role as the chairman
of the Goldmoon crime syndicate, living his

00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:31.190
life as a free man under his own will.
