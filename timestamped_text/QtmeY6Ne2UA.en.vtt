00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:06.800
Hi, Mystery Recapped here. Today I’m going&nbsp;
to explain a Thai survival thriller film&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:11.440
called “The Pool.” Spoilers ahead!&nbsp;
Watch out and take care! 
&nbsp;

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.160
At the beginning of the movie, a man named Day&nbsp;
wakes up lying in a drained swimming pool. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.760
has several injuries all over his body. He looks&nbsp;
at his palm to see it is severely wounded as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.760
As Day looks down, he sees a crocodile&nbsp;
biting on his leg. He screams in fear&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:37.120
when the creature drags him. The two struggle,&nbsp;
but Day manages to kick the animal off his feet.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.960
He drags himself away from the crocodile and&nbsp;
hits its head several times with a bucket. A dog&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.560
chained outside the pool barks while watching the&nbsp;
commotion. The crocodile turns around and leaves&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:55.440
Day alone. As the camera zooms out, we see Day is&nbsp;
stuck in a deep pool with no stairs to go out. 
&nbsp;

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.240
Cut to six days ago. The same pool was filled&nbsp;
completely with water. Day is helping with a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:05.920
photoshoot taking place in the pool. A sofa is&nbsp;
dropped into the water where a model in joker&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:12.480
makeup poses. Day’s girlfriend Koi arrives at the&nbsp;
shoot with their dog, Lucky. Day had been told to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:18.240
bring Lucky as a prop for the photoshoot. Day is&nbsp;
diabetic, so goes to a corner to take his insulin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.920
shot, where Koi follows him. She jokes about&nbsp;
being pregnant, which unsettles Day. They take&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.800
the dog to the shoot, which goes extremely well.&nbsp;
The crew takes a picture together and leaves.
&nbsp;

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:34.320
The following day, Day is at the pool with Lucky&nbsp;
again. He is there to clean the aftermath of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:40.000
shoot and seal the place, since no one will be&nbsp;
there for a long time. Before cleaning, he rests&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.920
on his floatie inside the pool. Day’s friend and&nbsp;
the pool’s supervisor, Mayom is also there and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.240
has his luggage packed. He is going out of the&nbsp;
town for the next three months and is there to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.200
say his goodbye. He pulls a lever down to drain&nbsp;
the water from the pool, then ties Lucky with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:01.680
a chain on a pole nearby. Before he leaves, Day&nbsp;
asks him to order a pizza. Mayom agrees and walks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.080
out of the place, while telling Day to come out&nbsp;
of the water quickly because he has drained it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.920
Day mistakenly falls asleep on his floatie, not&nbsp;
noticing the water level in the pool decreasing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:18.080
Sometime later, he is woken up by Lucky barking.&nbsp;
He finally notices the water level and swims&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.280
towards the edge to come out of the pool but&nbsp;
realises he is too deep inside to step out. 
&nbsp;

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.200
Day tries climbing up the pool, but is&nbsp;
unsuccessful. He even breaks one of his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.520
fingernails in the process. He then brings the&nbsp;
floatie to help him climb, but it doesn’t work&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:37.520
either. He yells for help, but the camera zooms&nbsp;
out to show us that no one is around. Day’s cell&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:42.160
phone is right at the edge of the swimming pool.&nbsp;
Suddenly it starts vibrating and moving towards&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.760
the edge. Day happily waits for it to fall, ready&nbsp;
to catch it. But just then, Lucky trips into the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.480
pool and hangs on its edge by the leash. Day&nbsp;
swims over to the other edge and helps Lucky&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.680
get back up with the help of the floatie. His&nbsp;
phone falls but is hung up by the charger. Day&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.400
quickly rushes to get it, but the water level&nbsp;
has gone lower. As he tries to reach the phone,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.840
it falls into the water and stops working. Day&nbsp;
then plans to stop further drawing of the water by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.480
covering the drainage ventilation with his robe.&nbsp;
Just when he goes inside the water to do that, a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:18.640
delivery boy arrives to deliver him his pizza. He&nbsp;
looks around and sees no one. Then, the boy calls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.680
Mayom to ask him what he should do. Mayom advises&nbsp;
the man to keep the pizza there and leave. 
&nbsp;

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.960
Meanwhile, Day’s belt gets stuck to the&nbsp;
ventilation. Before he can come out of the water,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:34.320
the delivery man leaves. Day still believes&nbsp;
that someone will come to look for him soon.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:39.680
Without thinking about it much, he again falls&nbsp;
asleep on his floatie. Sometime later, Koi&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.720
arrives at the pool and doesn’t notice the water&nbsp;
level. She gets on a platform and is ready to jump&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:50.400
into the pool when Day wakes up and asks her to&nbsp;
stop. A startled Koi slips from the platform,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.920
hits her head, and falls into the pool. When Day&nbsp;
brings her out, she is unconscious. He lays her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.880
in the floatie and uses the rob to stop her head&nbsp;
from bleeding. It is now nighttime, and the water&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:06.800
level has gone dangerously low. No one has come to&nbsp;
their aid yet. Day tries inspecting Koi’s wounds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:12.400
and sees a chunk of her flesh on his hands. 
Just then, Lucky starts to bark loudly. A&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.840
crocodile crawls out of the maintenance room and&nbsp;
moves towards the dog. Day notices the creature&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:23.120
and asks Lucky not to bark anymore. Before the&nbsp;
crocodile can reach Lucky, it trips and falls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:29.040
into the pool. Now, Day is stuck in a pool with&nbsp;
a crocodile and an injured girlfriend. The night&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:34.080
passes, and in the morning, the pool is fully&nbsp;
dry. Koi has still not regained consciousness.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:39.520
The crocodile is sleeping with its mouth open on&nbsp;
the other side of the pool. Day suddenly notices&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:45.040
a positive pregnancy test in Koi’s pocket and&nbsp;
figures out that she is pregnant. Surprised,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:49.200
he tells Koi’s unconscious body that&nbsp;
everything will be okay. He inspects&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.840
her injury and sees that it is still bleeding. 
He then approaches the sleeping crocodile, which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:59.280
has a duct tape roll inside his mouth. Mayom had&nbsp;
thrown the duct tape roll to Day before leaving.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.760
Day manages to take the tape out of the&nbsp;
creature’s mouth, but wakes it up in the process.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:09.840
The crocodile growls at Day, but he runs back to&nbsp;
Koi in time. He uses the duct tape and a piece of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:15.120
his robe to cover Koi’s injury and stop it from&nbsp;
bleeding. He had collected a bucket full of pool&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:20.320
water for them to drink. Day then plans to open&nbsp;
the pool’s vent and crawl his way outside through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:25.520
a tunnel. He opens the vent’s cover and goes&nbsp;
back to check on Koi. Before he can return, the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:31.120
crocodile crawls into the tunnel. Day waits for a&nbsp;
long time for it to return, but when it doesn’t,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:36.240
he takes the risk and goes into the vent himself.&nbsp;
He then crawls through the tunnel and finds an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:42.320
exit that is locked from outside. Just then, the&nbsp;
crocodile crawls back to the pool and towards Koi.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:47.760
Day rushes back and drags the creature by its&nbsp;
tail. The crocodile doesn’t attack him back. Koi&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:53.200
finally gains her consciousness back and calls for&nbsp;
Day. She tells Day about the pregnancy as he stays&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:59.120
beside her. It is now nighttime. Koi is resting&nbsp;
on the sofa that was used for the photoshoot. 
&nbsp;

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:03.520
Day notices Lucky eating the pizza outside.&nbsp;
The dog throws the box of pizza inside the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:07.840
pool for his owners. Day and Koi finally&nbsp;
eat for the first time in three days. 
&nbsp;

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:13.360
On the fourth day, they run out of drinking&nbsp;
water. Day falls unconscious and stays like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:18.800
that the whole day. He wakes up at night to Koi&nbsp;
looking at him. Day asks her if the crocodile gave&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:23.680
her trouble. Koi replies that the crocodile&nbsp;
is a female who laid eggs during the day.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:27.600
It starts to rain, giving the couple an&nbsp;
opportunity to gather more water. 
&nbsp;

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.880
The following morning, the crocodile&nbsp;
makes its way to a sleeping Day,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:36.640
but falls into the vent before reaching him. Day&nbsp;
pushes the creature inside and covers the vent.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:42.080
Then, the two try starting a fire with the pieces&nbsp;
of dried grass and Day’s glasses. They boil the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:48.000
crocodile eggs and devour them. At night, the&nbsp;
two mount the sofa and get on top of it in an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.280
attempt to escape, but they cannot reach the top.&nbsp;
They sit together talking about various things,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:58.640
when Day reveals that he wanted Koi to have an&nbsp;
abortion if she got pregnant. A heartbroken Koi&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:03.280
slaps Day as he tries to console her. They&nbsp;
know that they cannot survive in the sun for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:04.160
another day, So, the two decide to bring the&nbsp;
crocodile back and get into the tunnel. 
&nbsp;

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:08.640
The following day, they open the vent and the&nbsp;
crocodile returns to the pool. Koi quickly gets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:13.840
inside as the crocodile goes towards its eggs.&nbsp;
Seeing that its egg has been stolen, it attacks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:18.800
Day. But Day manages to escape into the tunnel&nbsp;
and close it before the creature can get him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:23.280
Day has not had an insulin shot in&nbsp;
several days and is getting sick.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:28.160
They see an insulin injection that Mayom had&nbsp;
placed on a table nearby through the vent. Day&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:33.280
tries using a string of wire to get the injection&nbsp;
near them, but instead, it falls and breaks into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:40.000
pieces. The couple cry in vain with no way out.&nbsp;
Day then notices his case of insulin on the floor.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.720
As it turns out, Mayom had accidentally dropped&nbsp;
it into the vent the last time he was there. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:50.560
injects himself with the medicine. Later, the two&nbsp;
notice a parachute flying over the pool. Day asks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:55.200
Koi to use a barrel to close the entrance of the&nbsp;
tunnel and goes out to call for help himself. 
&nbsp;

00:07:55.200 --> 00:08:00.240
When he gets back to the pool, he sees that the&nbsp;
parachute was just a kid’s toy. He screams for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:04.960
help in the hopes of someone listening to him.&nbsp;
A strong wind makes a wired clothes hanger fall&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:10.000
into the pool. Day tries using it to climb&nbsp;
and is happy when the wire holds his weight.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.800
His palms get injured, but he doesn’t stop&nbsp;
climbing. Just when he is about to reach the top,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:20.640
the wire detaches, making him fall back. An&nbsp;
injured Day falls unconscious. He wakes up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:25.840
on day six and looks at his injured palm. Same as&nbsp;
the very first scene from the movie, the crocodile&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:31.200
drags Day by his legs. He manages to free himself&nbsp;
and crawls to the sofa, but his leg is hurt,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:37.360
so he rests before going back to Koi. At night,&nbsp;
it starts to rain. Since the tunnel is blocked,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:43.120
the place Koi is in starts to flood. She bangs&nbsp;
the barrel to call Day back. Day listens to it and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:47.120
crawls back into the tunnel. This time, he&nbsp;
decides to go to the other end of the tunnel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:52.880
and finds a vent there too. He somehow manages&nbsp;
to break it open and happily steps out. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:59.360
he is soon washed over by disappointment. It turns&nbsp;
out that the facility had two swimming pools,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:04.880
and he just entered the second one. It is just&nbsp;
as deep as the first one and has no way out.
&nbsp;

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:09.680
It is now the seventh day. Two people come to&nbsp;
the pool looking for their parachute-like toy,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:14.400
but both Day and Koi are out of sight. They&nbsp;
enter the pool through a ladder and get their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:19.760
toy. The crocodile is hidden under the sofa, so&nbsp;
they cannot see it. Day hears the men talking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:25.280
and yells for help. When he reaches the top, they&nbsp;
are already gone, but the ladder is still there.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:29.120
It starts to rain again as he limps towards&nbsp;
the ladder. But before he can reach it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:35.040
Day is attacked by the crocodile. The place Koi is&nbsp;
in is almost completely flooded. The crocodile is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:40.560
about to kill Day, but Koi suddenly pops out of&nbsp;
the water and starts whistling. Seeing Koi alive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:45.600
gives Day further fuel to live on and he gets&nbsp;
away from the crocodile just at the right moment.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:50.800
Day walks towards the ladder again, but the barrel&nbsp;
the ladder was attached to rolls away, taking the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:57.920
ladder with it. Day’s last hope for survival is&nbsp;
gone. Just then, Koi’s whistling attracts Lucky&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:04.000
as the same whistle was used to train the dog.&nbsp;
Day warns Lucky not to jump but his efforts go in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:10.640
vain. The poor dog which was tied to a chain tries&nbsp;
to jump into the pool, but hangs by its neck.
&nbsp;

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:17.840
A helpless Day looks on and whimpers in&nbsp;
pain as Lucky slowly dies of suffocation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:24.240
Day then loses his cool and in a&nbsp;
fit of rage, he finally kills the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:29.360
crocodile by stabbing it with a pole. 
Day is left devastated after the encounter,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:35.040
but he still has to save Koi. He gathers a lot of&nbsp;
courage and does the unthinkable by climbing out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:40.800
of the swimming pool using the dead Lucky and his&nbsp;
chain. Day is finally outside the pool after seven&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:46.560
days of struggle. He quickly rushes to the vent&nbsp;
where Koi is and sees it is completely filled with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:51.600
water. He finds a large pipe nearby and
tries to open the vent but as it opens,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:56.800
he loses his balance and almost falls down the&nbsp;
same pool. Luckily, he manages to hang onto&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:02.320
the edge and uses his sheer will to climb up.
He then quickly dives in and brings an unconscious&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:08.560
Koi out. At first, it seems that Koi is dead&nbsp;
but after administering CPR and a lot of effort,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:12.800
he finally manages to save her. The&nbsp;
movie ends as the two finally hug.
