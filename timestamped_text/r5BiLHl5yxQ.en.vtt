Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:05.990
Today, I'm going to explain a 2017 American
psychological horror-thriller film titled

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:07.000
Geraldâ€™s Game.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.270
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:09.970
Watch out and take care!

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:12.740
It is a sunny day for a trip from Portland
to Alabama.

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.100
On the car, a hit from Sam Cooke in 1975 is
playing.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.560
A woman named Jessie turns the stereo off.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.289
Her husband, Gerald, asks if she wants to
switch to another song, but Jessie just wanted

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:23.960
to breathe in the scenery.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.039
Gerald naughtily glides his hands up Jessie's
skirts, but she takes it from her legs and

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:28.630
kisses it tenderly.

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.640
Gerald enters a curve in the middle of the
woods while Jessie is fidgeting.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.500
Jessie gets a sight of a dog in the middle
of the road and warns Gerald, who stopped

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.650
abruptly.

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:38.870
Jessie concludes that the dog is starving
as it was eating a dead rodent.

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.080
Gerald blows a long, loud horn to scare him
away from the road.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.149
Gerald continues driving after clearing the
stray dog off their way.

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.430
Their red car arrives at a house near a lake.

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.990
After getting off their vehicle, Gerald receives
a call from his firm's assistant.

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:54.170
Jessie takes a joyful stroll to the lakeside
around the house.

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.239
Gerald is really prepared for the trip, so
Jessie is absolutely delighted that there

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.360
was enough food in the fridge for the weekend.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.520
She sees a pack of meat and slices it.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.640
After a while, Jessie sits and whistles in
the front yard to call the stray dog that

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.159
they encountered earlier.

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:09.780
While she is waiting outside, Gerald takes
a blue pill of viagra in their room.

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.970
The stray dog appears from the woods.

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.520
Jessie leaves the platter of meat in front
of him, still keeping eye contact to pet him.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.990
The dog almost eats the food, but Gerald appears
from behind her.

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.159
Gerald carefully tells her how expensive the
meat was, but he figured that Jessie's kind

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:25.810
heart would still give it away even though
there were only four slices in the fridge.

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.659
Jessie tries to take the plate from the floor
of the road, but Gerald tells her that it

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:32.130
could be the best meat the dog will ever have
and leaves it for the dog to take.

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.799
The couple gets inside and leaves the main
door open.

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.130
Alone in the room, Jessie takes on her new
silk nightwear and positions herself awkwardly

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.270
in the bed.

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.689
She gives a signal to Gerald that she was
ready.

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:44.680
Gerald walks in with a pair of handcuffs and
draws closer to kiss her.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.500
He pushes her harshly to the bed and naughtily
clicks the cuffs.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.420
He ties her wrists to the pole of the bed.

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.610
He starts to sensually kiss her from the neckline
of her silk dress and remarks how he loved

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:53.630
the slip.

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.259
When he reached the edge of the bed, he pulls
her ankles to tighten the cuff's hold.

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:00.470
Jessie smiled sinisterly when her husband
halted the foreplay.

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.210
Gerald goes to the sink and drinks another
pill of viagra.

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.829
After drinking, Gerald starts changing his
character.

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:08.769
He is now reenacting his long-desired fantasy
as a sex offender.

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:10.819
He clears away the pillows from her head.

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:14.150
Like a sex offender, he warns her that there
is no way anybody could hear her from miles

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.220
away.

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.680
Jessie is panicking internally and calls out
his name to stop his fantasy.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.159
But Gerald denies that he is her husband,
and she would never know the his name.

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:23.939
He asks her to beg for help.

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:26.969
Jessie laughs lightly to calm herself down
and signal him that she was feeling uncomfortable

00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:28.450
with his fantasy.

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.629
Gerald asks her to cooperate to make his fantasy
feel real, but she admits that she feels weird.

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:35.290
He leans to kiss her, trying to ease her fear
away.

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.529
When he lowered down his kisses, Jessie screams
for help, finally playing his fantasy.

00:02:39.529 --> 00:02:42.110
He bites her breast, which made her gasp in
pain.

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.260
He apologizes but proceeds to close her mouth
with his hands.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.169
Jessie stops him as pain and fear are already
taking over her.

00:02:48.169 --> 00:02:51.379
Her aggressive husband gets more aggressive,
concluding that her discomfort and resistance

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:53.199
are still part of their roleplay.

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:55.959
He kneels to grind into her and calls himself
her daddy.

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:57.859
Something inside Jessie snapped.

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:01.230
She shouts angrily to stop him and orders
him to uncuff her, but Gerald still thinks

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.610
she is toying with him.

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.999
She was lost entirely in frustration, but
Gerald still argues that they were taking

00:03:05.999 --> 00:03:08.290
the vacation to add spice to their marriage.

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.829
She tears up and admits that she was trying
to go with his flow, but it isn't working.

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:15.730
She wonders if a kinky bedroom is all he ever
wanted now that they have reached such age.

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.569
She reminds him that Gerald did not touch
her for several months until she gave him

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:20.680
permission to play perverted games.

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.260
Jessie realizes that his fantasy for ravishment
is the reason why he lost pleasure and interest

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:25.519
in her for months.

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:29.339
She begs him to unlock the handcuffs because
it will never be the saviour of their marriage.

00:03:29.339 --> 00:03:31.909
Gerald challenges her that he won't open them
while breathing heavily.

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:34.680
He promises that he will be sweet this time
around and straightens her body in the bed

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:35.680
again.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.900
He leans down, whispering that he will be
doing it sweetly now.

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.790
Knowing that he can't be stopped, she bites
him squarely in the lips.

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.290
The mad Gerald rises up, questioning where
did their marriage go wrong.

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.909
He holds his left shoulder and loses his focus.

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:50.239
Gerald gasps, still looking for support.

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:52.999
Jessie calls out his name while Gerald is
trembling silently.

00:03:52.999 --> 00:03:56.950
He collapses above her, restraining her from
figuring out what is happening to her husband.

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.909
Thinking that he might be scaring her for
not cooperating with his fantasy, she pushes

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:01.669
his dead weight with her legs.

00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:04.719
She manages to take him off with her right
foot, but Gerald's open eyes are not moving

00:04:04.719 --> 00:04:07.290
at all, and the veins in his forehead are
bulging.

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.529
Without much control, she lets him go to the
edge of the bed, but his body rolled helplessly

00:04:10.529 --> 00:04:11.680
on the floor.

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.879
She sits to acquire more view of the floor
where he rolled, begging and screaming at

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:15.879
him to wake up.

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:19.049
She struggles to unlink her cuffs from the
pole, but to no avail, she just sat there

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.609
crying to him that it sounds more realistic
now.

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:24.639
She begs him to come back to the bed to do
anything he wants with her, but her dead husband

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:25.639
is still motionless.

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:27.940
She starts screaming for help.

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.150
The dusk has come, and the shadows started
taking over the sunlight.

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:32.889
Jessie is getting hoarse from shouting.

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:36.060
She finds a little hope after hearing a rustling
sound outside.

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.539
Silently entering the bedroom door was the
stray dog.

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:42.020
She talks to him in despair, hoping that he
would call for rescue in the woods.

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.970
So much to her disappointment, the dog makes
a tentative move towards Gerald's body.

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.389
Jessie tries to shoo him away as the dog's
tongue glides to lick Gerald's arm.

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:52.310
The dog steps back for a brief while but returns
to sniff it.

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:56.210
With its scavenging senses, the dog manages
to bite and wound Gerald's arm.

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:59.069
Jessie gets a hold of a thin book and throws
it towards the dog.

00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:01.360
Jessie cries as the dog backs out to the door.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.530
Now with a clear view of the piece of her
husband's skin in the dog's mouth, she moans

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:06.530
and wails in disgust and sorrow.

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:09.930
She hides her face away while the dog is ripping
the meat with its fangs.

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:13.669
When she looked up, Gerald is already trying
to set himself erect from the floor.

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:16.819
Jessie thankfully mutters that he was alive
and asks him to uncuff her.

00:05:16.819 --> 00:05:19.699
Gerald is holding his right arm with his left
hand and points that his wound was caused

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:21.550
by the dog she fed earlier.

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:24.159
Jessie catches sight of Gerald's figure still
on the floor.

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:27.550
She looks back astounded at her husband, who
was back on his feet, blaming her that she

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:29.169
was the one who fed the dog.

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:31.670
With his wounded arm, he moves around her
vision.

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:35.530
He remarks how she just sat there for hours,
even though his corpse was on the floor.

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:38.990
Like the lawyer he was, Gerald concludes that
Jessie is just having a mental breakdown after

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:41.659
seeing that a dog just started feasting on
his corpse.

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:45.349
He keeps going back to the punchline, saying
Jessie is just an unplugged life support system

00:05:45.349 --> 00:05:47.659
charging low while time is ticking by.

00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:51.289
Gerald leans beside her, leading her questions
to calculate how much time has gone by, and

00:05:51.289 --> 00:05:54.990
soon after, one more figure of Gerald starts
appearing in her window.

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:58.229
The two faces remind her in a chorus that
she has wasted five long hours doing nothing

00:05:58.229 --> 00:06:01.040
but scream for help to neighbours who are
a long-distance away.

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:04.240
The faces are gone for a while, and she looks
over the busy dog at the door and the phone

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.419
over the bedside table on her right.

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:09.439
Gerald warns her that no matter how hard she'd
break her wrist, the cuffs are never going

00:06:09.439 --> 00:06:11.180
to let her go.

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:14.099
Surprisingly, Jessie manages to pull her right
wrist out of the cuff.

00:06:14.099 --> 00:06:17.530
She stands to the left side of the bed and
struggles to break free from the pole.

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:20.699
When the bar cracked successfully, Jessie
walks to the door and proudly tells Gerald

00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:21.699
that it was easy.

00:06:21.699 --> 00:06:24.620
But breaking free isn't that easy, and the
image of Jessie breaking free from the cuff

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:25.960
isn't real.

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:29.850
Gerald tells the chained Jessie that her hands
won't fit the cuffs, and the poles are reinforced.

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:33.330
Her animated self draws to the bed's edge,
telling her never to listen because her condescending

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:35.919
husband is always the reason she is in deep
trouble.

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:39.659
Her inner self belittles his mighty tiny genitalia,
but Jessie retorts that she was chained to

00:06:39.659 --> 00:06:41.520
the bed no matter what she says.

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:45.169
She warns her that if Jessie just runs away
and hallucinate in denial and panic, she will

00:06:45.169 --> 00:06:46.169
die.

00:06:46.169 --> 00:06:49.860
She reminds Jessie that somebody else had
placed Jessie in chains before Gerald did.

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:53.789
Gerald curiously asks who it was, but Jessie
dismisses him with her deep breathing.

00:06:53.789 --> 00:06:56.740
Jessie storms off until the shadows of the
sun disappear.

00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:00.289
When it was finally dark, Jessie stretches
her legs out to reach for the phone, but Gerald

00:07:00.289 --> 00:07:02.490
stops her because it wasn't charged anyway.

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:06.229
The inner Jessie retorts that Gerald didn't
even do a load of laundry during their marriage.

00:07:06.229 --> 00:07:09.770
It was an arduous struggle getting her foot
to the phone, so her inner self suggests that

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:12.600
she should live long enough to let people
know that she needs help.

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:15.199
The dog is still savouring Gerald's meat on
the floor.

00:07:15.199 --> 00:07:19.410
She moans in disgust and hunger, as she can't
remember the taste of her last meal and beverage.

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:22.229
Her head was throbbing in pain when Gerald
appeared beside her.

00:07:22.229 --> 00:07:25.030
He dares her how long she can hold without
water and food.

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:27.350
It's been seven hours since she last drank
water.

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:31.189
To match her husband's audacity, Jessie looks
over his viagra pills in despair and reminds

00:07:31.189 --> 00:07:33.249
him about his erectile dysfunction.

00:07:33.249 --> 00:07:36.740
Gerald recalls how soft it was in a casual
bedroom tone and how it went into a hard pet

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:39.210
with just a hint of dominance and extreme
kink.

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:42.349
Since then, Jessie wondered who her husband
really was after knowing his dirty little

00:07:42.349 --> 00:07:43.349
secret.

00:07:43.349 --> 00:07:46.860
Her inner voice, though, insists that she
loved that he took those little blue pills.

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:49.199
She asks Gerald to take one to prove her right.

00:07:49.199 --> 00:07:53.029
Gerald drinks a drug and walks close to leave
a glass of water on the shelf above the headrest.

00:07:53.029 --> 00:07:54.449
It was a trigger.

00:07:54.449 --> 00:07:57.620
Gerald had always been thirsty ever since
he started taking the viagra months ago, and

00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:00.490
he always made sure he had water with him
anywhere near the bed.

00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:03.770
Jessie shakes the shelf smoothly, with the
slightest control that she has.

00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:06.620
She gasps in hope as the glass appears closer
to the edge.

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:09.600
Her sore left wrist lifts the base of the
shelf until the glass slips through the right

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:10.749
edge of the shelf.

00:08:10.749 --> 00:08:14.840
Finally, she gets a hold of the glass, but
she can't move it closer to her mouth.

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:18.009
Drops of water have been spilt, so Gerald
is smirking upon her.

00:08:18.009 --> 00:08:21.020
Her inner self tells her to put it back to
where she can easily reach it.

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:22.729
She trembles as she follows.

00:08:22.729 --> 00:08:25.939
When she knew the water is reserved, the dog
stands and tears another piece of meat from

00:08:25.939 --> 00:08:26.939
Gerald's body.

00:08:26.939 --> 00:08:30.039
Her inner self consoles her that the dog was
just making a mean to survive, and she should

00:08:30.039 --> 00:08:31.139
do the same.

00:08:31.139 --> 00:08:35.130
She tells her that she will reunite with Gerald
inside the dog if she doesn't hold long enough.

00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:39.469
She agrees with her, but Gerald appears above
her again, complimenting her body in the nightwear.

00:08:39.469 --> 00:08:42.149
Her inner voice interrupts and tells her that
it was brand new.

00:08:42.149 --> 00:08:43.729
An idea popped into her.

00:08:43.729 --> 00:08:46.889
She smiles ridiculously while reaching out
on the shelf overhead for the price tag she

00:08:46.889 --> 00:08:49.269
had torn before she got in bed with Gerald.

00:08:49.269 --> 00:08:52.370
She singlehandedly rolls it with her left
hand and reaches for the glass of water with

00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:53.589
her right hand.

00:08:53.589 --> 00:08:55.220
Her idea is successful.

00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:58.700
She sips from the glass with her make-shift
straw, but she decides to spare a small volume

00:08:58.700 --> 00:08:59.870
for later.

00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:03.510
After returning the glass to the overhead
shelf, she finds herself dozing away.

00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:06.500
She struggles to close her eyes, with the
glimpse of the dog tearing Gerald's limbs

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:07.500
apart.

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:10.649
Gerald appears on her left, challenging her
that she'll be dead tomorrow if no one finds

00:09:10.649 --> 00:09:11.680
her tonight.

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:14.790
Her inner self, though, sympathizes with her
need for strength.

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:18.029
With a more straightforward path to follow,
Jessie leans to her left shoulder and shuts

00:09:18.029 --> 00:09:19.370
her eyes.

00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:22.279
After a satisfying meal, the stray dog bolts
outside.

00:09:22.279 --> 00:09:25.500
In the middle of the night, he starts to bark
from an audible distance.

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:27.190
His bark wakes Jessie up.

00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:28.840
Jessie catches sight of a figure.

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:32.120
It was dark at first, but she continues to
discern what it was when it started drawing

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:33.120
closer.

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:35.209
It was a dubious, terrifying figure.

00:09:35.209 --> 00:09:38.450
She asks for help regardless of how bizarre
he looks, but he opened a bag of ornaments

00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:40.779
and bones instead of giving her a hand.

00:09:40.779 --> 00:09:44.510
Seeing what was inside his load, she convinces
herself that the figure isn't real.

00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:47.920
When she closed her eyes, Gerald whispers
that she just summoned the silhouette of death,

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:49.779
which he called the Moonlight Man.

00:09:49.779 --> 00:09:52.510
Gerald challenges her that the silhouette
was real because the dog went out to avoid

00:09:52.510 --> 00:09:53.510
it.

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:56.240
Jessie opens her eyes, and another Gerald
wearing a collared shirt appears from the

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:57.769
farther side of the bed.

00:09:57.769 --> 00:10:01.680
He warns that the dog will be back soon to
tear her apart and endears her as Mouse.

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:02.959
Jessie dozes away again.

00:10:02.959 --> 00:10:06.810
The 12-year-old Jessie, her younger siblings
and her parents set foot on their family lake

00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:07.810
house.

00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:11.089
Apparently, her mother hated having her on
their boat trip and insisted to her father

00:10:11.089 --> 00:10:14.720
that she does not want her to be on the trip
if Jessie shows no interest to bond with them.

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:17.700
While her mother and younger siblings went
on a boat trip on the lake, Jessie was left

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:19.680
alone at the lakeside with her father.

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:23.730
He gave her an anti-glaring binocular so she
could watch as the solar eclipse unfolds.

00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:26.519
It was supposed to be an innocent eclipse
watch with him until he asked her to sit on

00:10:26.519 --> 00:10:29.440
his lap, just like what she did when she was
a small kid.

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:32.970
When she willingly sat, her father jerked
himself off until the eclipse was complete.

00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:36.230
When she woke up, she winces in pain at how
sore her hands have become.

00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:39.500
There were flies around the room, feasting
upon Gerald's remains.

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:42.149
The dog stands up after hearing that she has
woken up.

00:10:42.149 --> 00:10:43.980
She screams from the bad cramps.

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:47.670
Her inner voice suggests that she should just
keep pedalling to keep her circulation.

00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:51.480
After pedalling, she reaches out for the glass
of water and the straw from the shelf.

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:55.199
Gerald appears beside her, asking her about
the curious bad dream about Mouse.

00:10:55.199 --> 00:10:58.310
Jessie defends that her childhood issue is
nowhere near relevant to her marriage with

00:10:58.310 --> 00:10:59.310
Gerald.

00:10:59.310 --> 00:11:02.070
Her inner voice reiterates that their marriage
only happened because he was just like her

00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:03.070
father.

00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:06.310
She elaborated to the clueless Gerald that
Jessie was taken fresh and ripe by her father,

00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:09.480
and she lived to tolerate all the nights of
Gerald's distance and unfaithfulness, just

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:11.800
like how she put up with her father's assault.

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:14.661
Jessie reveals to the dead Gerald that her
father never touched her carnally, that he

00:11:14.661 --> 00:11:17.199
just fantasized about her by touching himself.

00:11:17.199 --> 00:11:21.130
But her inner voice confidently uncovers that
her father did something to her in the bedroom.

00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:24.160
Jessie admits that she drowned those secrets
long ago in a well, where she saw a woman

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:26.440
in a red dress during the burning eclipse.

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:29.330
Knowing that she won't reveal more, Gerald
teases her to look at the terrifying figure

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:30.560
in the room.

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:33.820
Jessie convinces herself that the figure wasn't
real at all, but there was a bloody footprint

00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:34.880
on the floor.

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:37.779
He warns that the Moonlight Man will be back
tonight, and he'll take her wedding ring with

00:11:37.779 --> 00:11:39.250
him if she dies.

00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:43.200
Jessie warns her inner self and Gerald to
vanish after she finishes counting to ten.

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:46.300
It was the 12-year old Jessie, fidgeting in
front of the mirror.

00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:49.060
She takes her sundress off and puts it in
the middle of the bed.

00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:51.819
Her father calls her again with that traumatizing
endearment.

00:11:51.819 --> 00:11:55.319
Her father sits on the farther edge of the
bed and taps the space beside him.

00:11:55.319 --> 00:11:57.519
She was scared, but she chose to follow.

00:11:57.519 --> 00:12:00.899
Her father apologizes but orchestrates a scheme
shortly so she would shut her mouth to keep

00:12:00.899 --> 00:12:02.460
it a secret from everyone.

00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:06.440
The younger Jessie was forced to stay silent
to steer away from her mother's pain and anger.

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:10.060
When he left, Jessie looks over to see the
obscure figure licking her foot.

00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:12.759
It was the dog, licking its tongue over Jessie's
foot.

00:12:12.759 --> 00:12:14.440
Jessie kicks her foot to shoo him away.

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:18.100
Luckily, the dog backs down and tears Gerald's
limbs instead.

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:21.290
Gerald walks over to her bed again and ridicules
that the dog will be back eventually for a

00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:22.700
lump of fresher meat.

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:26.600
It was afternoon again, and Jessie's lips
were already pale and cracked from dehydration

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:27.610
and exhaustion.

00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:30.940
Just like the functioning Gerald, he throws
her a dozen of dreadful scenarios again while

00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:32.779
she was lying weak and desperate.

00:12:32.779 --> 00:12:35.399
Jessie starts singing a lullaby to drown Gerald's
insults.

00:12:35.399 --> 00:12:38.529
Before storming off, she catches a glimpse
of her father looking down over her on the

00:12:38.529 --> 00:12:39.579
bed.

00:12:39.579 --> 00:12:43.660
While the eclipse is burning, the older Jessie
faces a chained younger Jessie in the bedroom.

00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:47.350
The younger Jessie reminds her that what happened
after the eclipse is her salvation.

00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:49.640
The family was having dinner after the eclipse.

00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:52.279
Her mother and younger siblings were back
from the boat trip.

00:12:52.279 --> 00:12:55.360
While recounting how the day went, her mother
asked her how the eclipse went in the lakeside

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:56.480
for Jessie.

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:58.750
Her father touched her mother's pregnant belly.

00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:01.750
Jessie squeezed her glass too hard that it
made a cut on her palms.

00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:05.069
While her father attended to the younger Jessie's
wounds, the older Jessie realizes what she

00:13:05.069 --> 00:13:06.550
needs to do.

00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:09.720
Her inner voice warns that she must not cut
deep, as she might die.

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:13.110
But she retorts that if she doesn't risk it,
she'll also die of seizures, dehydration,

00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:14.660
or the dog.

00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:18.259
Without so much strength left, she bids goodbye
to the warped visions in front of her.

00:13:18.259 --> 00:13:20.630
She takes the glass and slams it onto the
shelf.

00:13:20.630 --> 00:13:23.410
She squeezes her palms around the glasses
left in her grip.

00:13:23.410 --> 00:13:26.600
She trembles as she positions the best shard
on the shelf and drags the skin of her wrist

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:27.620
against it.

00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:29.970
It was painful, but her plan seems to work.

00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:31.980
The blood made her skin slick as oil.

00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:35.170
She manages to slip her right wrist off from
the cuff, but the skin was awfully peeled

00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:36.170
off.

00:13:36.170 --> 00:13:40.050
She pushes the bed to the right side and slips
over so her right leg could reach the phone.

00:13:40.050 --> 00:13:42.920
Unfortunately, the phone's battery was running
dead low.

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:45.430
She pulls the pole of the bed to the right
so she could hold her wounded wrist to the

00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:46.430
key.

00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:49.470
She frantically grasps for the key beside
the canister of viagra.

00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:52.480
With her trembling right hand, she clasps
the key to her mouth.

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:54.850
She leans close to unlock herself from the
cuff.

00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:58.629
She steps towards the sink and drinks heavily
like it was her first time drinking water.

00:13:58.629 --> 00:14:01.990
After drinking, she opens a few drawers for
a bandage but found none.

00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:04.810
She finds two menstrual napkins and wraps
them around her wrist.

00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:07.900
She gets a blurry sight of where the car key
was, but it was too late.

00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:10.910
She collapses on the floor from dehydration
and fatigue.

00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:12.790
It was already dark when she woke up.

00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:15.639
The dog was grunting while tearing another
piece of Gerald's body.

00:14:15.639 --> 00:14:19.160
It was a gut-wrenching mess, which she thought
might be her last scene with her husband.

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:22.370
She drags herself to the cabinet where the
car key was, but she looks back in horror

00:14:22.370 --> 00:14:24.910
when the dog barked in the middle of their
dark bedroom.

00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:27.199
Just rooms away from her stand the Moonlight
Man.

00:14:27.199 --> 00:14:30.029
She takes small dragging steps to hand him
their wedding ring and leaves the room like

00:14:30.029 --> 00:14:31.490
she was in a race.

00:14:31.490 --> 00:14:34.130
Jessie was steering the wheel of the red car
when Gerald appeared in the dark and bade

00:14:34.130 --> 00:14:35.550
her a wave goodbye.

00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:38.610
She smiles bitterly and proceeds to drive
through the darkness of the night.

00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:41.800
In the middle of her escape from terror, she
dozes off briefly.

00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:43.699
She wakes up with the eclipse above.

00:14:43.699 --> 00:14:47.370
From the rearview mirror, the moonlight man
smiles from the backseat of the car.

00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:49.930
He whispers in her ear, and the car crashes
into a tree.

00:14:49.930 --> 00:14:53.940
A nearby house lights up, and some flashlights
are pointing in her direction.

00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:57.089
Knowing that men were coming towards her,
she honks and goes out of her car.

00:14:57.089 --> 00:14:59.779
Her bloody body collapses before they could
reach her.

00:14:59.779 --> 00:15:03.579
Six months later, Jessie writes a letter to
her younger self with her bandaged hand.

00:15:03.579 --> 00:15:06.670
She was rescued that night, but she kept her
recollection of trauma from the doctors and

00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:07.760
cops.

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:11.319
Gerald's firm hired a coroner who concluded
that his death was due to a cardiac attack.

00:15:11.319 --> 00:15:13.759
The paperwork was fixed, and so was her life.

00:15:13.759 --> 00:15:16.899
But every night, a disfigured visitor reminds
her of the terror.

00:15:16.899 --> 00:15:19.800
Even though he vanishes into the nightlight,
it was still a question why the cops never

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:20.960
found her wedding ring.

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:24.850
To help herself heal, Jessie used some amount
of Gerald's insurance to build a foundation

00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:26.670
for victims of carnal assault.

00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:30.129
When she thought the ordeal was over, she
reads a piece of news about the Crypt Creeper.

00:15:30.129 --> 00:15:34.380
A man named Raymond Joubert is suffering from
Acromegaly and has been strolling around Alabama

00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:38.360
to gather male corpses, eat their faces, steal
and keep a bone or some other possessions

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:39.879
as his souvenir.

00:15:39.879 --> 00:15:42.940
Jessie could not believe he was real, but
the crime perfectly explains why Gerald's

00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:45.819
face was mutilated and why she was left unharmed.

00:15:45.819 --> 00:15:48.889
Raymond has also killed a dozen of living
people aside from the dead corpses and keeps

00:15:48.889 --> 00:15:50.310
their body parts in jars.

00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:53.750
In an afternoon with the eclipse overhead,
the younger Jessie reads the letter while

00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:55.379
sitting with the older Jessie.

00:15:55.379 --> 00:15:58.089
The letter warns the younger her that the
people who are supposed to protect her from

00:15:58.089 --> 00:16:01.000
the monsters turned out to be monsters themselves.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.140
Jessie attends the court for Raymond's sentence.

00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:06.260
When she interrupted, Raymond breaks free
from his cuffs and tells her the same lines

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:08.279
she used to mutter when he appeared in the
lake house.

00:16:08.279 --> 00:16:12.750
In her head, Jessie sees Raymond as her father,
her husband and as the moonlight man.

00:16:12.750 --> 00:16:21.759
She smiles triumphantly and regards him as
