00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.870
Welcome to Moviecaps.

00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:07.150
Today I will show you a Comedy, Crime, Drama
film from 2019 titled Hustlers.

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:08.500
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.450
Watch out and take care.

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:11.750
It is 2004.

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:16.139
Destiny, the newbie at a nightclub, gets ready
for her first shift.

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.130
Just when Justice, a co-worker of hers takes
the stage, Destiny gets her first client.

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.669
But things don’t go as smooth as she thought
they would, as the girls already have their

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:25.829
regulars.

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:29.499
With her insufficient skills, she finds it
hard to win them over.

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:33.940
After paying most of her earnings to the casino
as a fee, she heads back home, where she lives

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.510
with her grandmother.

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.120
She wakes up at 3 pm to get ready for her
shift.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.790
Before leaving, she notices that her grandmother
has sold her necklace, so Destiny gives her

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.010
some cash, to which the old lady responds
with grateful words.

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.719
Once at the club, Destiny is mesmerized by
the main stage performance of Ramona.

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.679
When Ramona walks past Destiny, she whispers
to her, “Doesn’t money make you aroused?”

00:00:56.679 --> 00:01:00.769
After the show, Destiny joins the star at
the rooftop, asking for a light.

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:02.769
They end up having a friendly chat.

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:06.479
The newbie opens up about not having enough
skills and not doing so well on her first

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:07.500
days.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.730
Ramona comforts her and suggests mentoring
Destiny, showing her some of her moves, and

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:13.380
even working together.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.840
Fast-forward to 2014 shows a different version
of Destiny, who is being interviewed for an

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:18.840
article.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.980
The interviewer asks “so when did things
get out of control?”, and Destiny replies

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.619
that Ramona was always in control.

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.689
Back to 2004, on the following day, before
customers barge in, Ramona teaches Destiny

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.250
how to pole dance.

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.630
Destiny once again is in awe of Ramona’s
flawless moves.

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.000
She tries to give it a shot with the help
of her gorgeous mentor.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.600
When they are both catching their breath and
laughing, Diamond gets in.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.479
Ramona introduces her to Destiny and suggests
she teaches the newbie how to give a proper

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:47.890
lap dance.

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.920
Back at the changing room, the girls are getting
ready and chit-chatting about the stereotypes

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.420
people have about strippers and how their
real lives are different from the persona

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.290
they show at the club.

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.380
Destiny recalls the classification Ramona
taught her: the three tiers of wall street

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.380
guys.

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.020
The ones at the bottom who don’t do illegal
work don’t have much money, but the girls

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.290
can get their way around it if they do.

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:12.170
The ones in the middle get their hands a little
dirty but don’t cross limits.

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.680
And finally, there are the ones on top.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.080
They come through the back door, get private
rooms, and spend lots of money, and I mean

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.460
lots, 10-15 thousand a night.

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:26.090
There were no cameras, and they could do whatever
they wanted with no consequences.

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.850
Working with Ramona made Destiny improve,
and she made a lot more money.

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.010
They also tightened their friendship bond.

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.280
Destiny, or Dorothy as her grandma calls her,
treats herself to some fine shopping.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.770
Ramona invites her over and shows her project
of designing a swimsuit line.

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.500
After introducing the future label, Swimona.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.460
We are introduced to Juliet, Ramona’s daughter.

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:52.020
Later that night, Ramona and Dorothy are having
a heartfelt talk about their future aspirations

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:53.470
and goals.

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.290
We are then taken back to the interview where
Dorothy asks how much of her story is going

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:58.860
to be in the article.

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.400
She doesn’t want to give a bad impression
about strippers and reinforce the stigma as

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.550
she was simply making an honest living back
then.

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.990
Back to her stripper days, Destiny is making
money, getting her own place, taking care

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:12.960
of her grandma, and even going back to studying.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:17.870
She was learning at the counter when a man,
Stephen, approached her praising her handwriting.

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.540
Harnessing her sweet talk skills, she tells
him it’s probably because she doesn’t

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:22.800
have a computer.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.980
Later she’s at the girl’s lockers studying
on her new laptop.

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.430
2007 was the best, according to Dorothy.

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.710
She met Johnny, her boyfriend, with whom she
had constantly been arguing.

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:36.550
She was making more money than Wallstreet
guys.

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.580
Even managed to buy her first car.

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.300
The last great night that Dorothy remembers
was when Usher walked in.

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.390
Everyone was dancing on the stage.

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.130
Then 2008 happened.

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.310
The worst financial disaster that happened
in decades.

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.830
Not the best time to get pregnant, but Johnny
promises he’ll take care of her.

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:57.290
Two and a half years later, it’s 2011 and
Dorothy has a daughter, Lily.

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.880
A final argument made the angry mother kick
Johnny out and she was left alone with her

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.280
daughter, no job at hand.

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.970
She tried calling Stephen, the tech guy who
offered her a computer back in the glory days.

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.850
But it turns out he now has a family of his
own.

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:16.510
And so she crossed out the last person on
her ex-clients list that is of no help now.

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.079
Dorothy tries applying for a job at retail
but to no avail.

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:24.389
She falls into the vicious “we want employees
with experience, but we can’t give you that

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:25.430
experience” loop.

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.889
And so she’s obliged to go back to the club
that has changed a lot.

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:31.830
All her friends left, and the new girls are
rude.

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.780
The club is more than empty.

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.659
Even the house mom ended up in customer service.

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:39.870
The customers don’t want to spend money
and the new girls do what they’re not supposed

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.590
to do to get the cash.

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:45.610
Destiny is put in a situation where she abides
by a request for cash.

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:50.349
She feels disgusted with herself, especially
when she realizes that she was scammed.

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:52.639
The client didn’t give her the promised
amount.

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:57.000
Devastated, Destiny leaves the champagne room
and goes back into the club, when she sees

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.550
her best friend she lost touch with years
ago, Ramona.

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.449
The two friends catch up over a cup of coffee
and Ramona tells Dorothy what she has been

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:06.710
up to since the crisis started.

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:09.650
After the financial crash, the club wasn’t
the same.

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:12.909
Mercedes found Ramona a job in a retail store.

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:17.219
She is dealing with her own issues as her
fiancé, Dragon, got arrested, and she can’t

00:05:17.219 --> 00:05:18.219
afford a lawyer.

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:22.361
Ramona’s job at the retail wasn’t going
so well, so she went back to the club, but

00:05:22.361 --> 00:05:25.979
the latter wasn’t pleasant either, so she
came up with a plan.

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:27.900
Spot potential customers.

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:29.099
Get them drunk.

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:30.719
Bring them to the nightclub.

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:33.939
Push their credit card as far as they can
and get a percentage of their spending at

00:05:33.939 --> 00:05:35.110
the club.

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:37.620
But their preys weren’t always so complying.

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:41.090
Some even caught up with their scheme, and
so they ended up losing money instead.

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:44.790
That’s when Ramona thought of giving her
plan a little boost.

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:48.800
Instead of simply waiting for their targets
to get drunk, they would spice their drinks.

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:53.280
Ketamine to lose their memory and MDMA for
them to be happy and have a good time.

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:56.189
And so her plan worked and the cash kept coming
in.

00:05:56.189 --> 00:06:00.760
By the end of her story, Ramona invited desperate
Destiny to join her team.

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.759
She joins them on their next hustle.

00:06:02.759 --> 00:06:04.260
Garry was the pray.

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:08.389
While he is distracted, Ramona spices the
drink, and they get to the club.

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:13.080
Barely conscious, Garry grabs his wallet,
and Ramona swipes his golden card.

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:14.970
The plan was a success.

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:19.939
After a big celebration, to be on the safe
side, they decided to change their recipe.

00:06:19.939 --> 00:06:24.150
After the first "cook" knocked them out cold,
the second one out of the oven was perfect.

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:27.840
They decided not to fish for strangers but
instead call some old friends.

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:30.190
Didn’t take them long to reel them in.

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:33.860
Each day was a new trip to the club, it worked
almost too well.

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:38.310
Ramona got a new place, Destiny paid for her
grandmother’s house, Mercedes hired a lawyer

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:43.090
for her fiancé, and Annabelle is feeling
cozy with her cat in her new apartment.

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:46.419
The girls even decided to outsource and expand
their team.

00:06:46.419 --> 00:06:48.380
They taught the new girls their game.

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:51.069
Hustling became their everyday business.

00:06:51.069 --> 00:06:55.849
Around Christmas time, they gathered at Ramona’s
house, along with Juliet, Ramona’s girl,

00:06:55.849 --> 00:06:58.150
Destiny’s grandmother, and Lily.

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:02.789
Everyone was celebrating and exchanging gifts
- a truly heartwarming moment.

00:07:02.789 --> 00:07:07.599
Back to the initial 2014 interview, Dorothy
is now the one asking questions.

00:07:07.599 --> 00:07:11.630
She asks about Elizabeth’s financial status
growing up to justify their actions since

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:13.310
they were in a bad place.

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:17.050
Dorothy wants to stop the interview since
she didn’t want to be dragged into a situation

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:20.870
that would make her badmouth the girls, who
she considers her sisters.

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:25.020
Just then, Elizabeth told her that Ramona
had said the same thing the previous day.

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:26.590
Dorothy is shocked.

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:29.020
She clearly has a grudge against Ramona.

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:31.770
She decides to continue with the interview.

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:33.129
2013.

00:07:33.129 --> 00:07:36.490
Everything was going well until Ramona’s
greed got the best of her.

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:41.159
She decided that she didn’t need the club
anymore and would meet their clients at hotels.

00:07:41.159 --> 00:07:45.370
In spite of Dorothy’s objections, a new
girl joins the crew, Dawn.

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:48.849
The redhead was reckless, sloppy, and a cokehead.

00:07:48.849 --> 00:07:52.479
An incident happens when Mercedes is with
one of Ramona’s clients.

00:07:52.479 --> 00:07:56.500
The drugged man thinks he can jump into the
pool from the 1st floor, but he ends up falling

00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:57.979
onto the ground.

00:07:57.979 --> 00:08:01.849
While the girls drive him to the hospital,
they try to reach Ramona, but she is busy

00:08:01.849 --> 00:08:03.150
bailing out Dawn.

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:07.509
When Destiny comes back home, she finds out
that her grandmother has passed away.

00:08:07.509 --> 00:08:10.070
Ramona comes to the funeral and comforts her.

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:14.479
She also invites her to a gig that night to
get her mind off things and get some money.

00:08:14.479 --> 00:08:17.969
Dorothy tells Elizabeth that at first, she
thought there was going to be some kind of

00:08:17.969 --> 00:08:21.809
goal, and once she reached that goal, she
would stop and start clean.

00:08:21.809 --> 00:08:24.770
The interviewer then asked if that’s what
happened with Doug.

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:28.770
Dorothy denies knowing someone with such a
name and calls Ramona a liar.

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:32.950
Elizabeth goes further into unraveling what
Ramona said about Dorothy.

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:37.120
Mainly that Dorothy didn’t just do it for
revenge but she was trying to make friends.

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:39.940
Her mom left her at her grandmother’s and
ran away.

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:41.760
This made her have it tough.

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:45.450
When Elizabeth asked what happened between
Ramona and her, she turned off the recording

00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:48.020
tape and showed Elizabeth off.

00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:53.150
Once Elizabeth arrives home, she gets a call
from Dorothy, who starts telling her the story.

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:57.190
Ramona met Doug years ago, he had some family
issues, and his friend brought him to the

00:08:57.190 --> 00:08:58.720
club to feel better.

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:03.030
Destiny had a heartfelt talk with him, but
to Ramona, he was just another target.

00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:06.760
The girls ended up maxing out his company’s
card and so he was fired.

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:11.460
Doug called Destiny asking for his money back
since he can’t afford to pay his mortgage.

00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:16.040
When Ramona notices that Destiny starts showing
compassion, she wrestles her down and snatches

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:18.000
the phone, hanging up.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.200
Doug filed a police report since he had voice
recordings from the reckless Dawn, who spilled

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:23.710
the beans when drunk.

00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:27.550
Dawn was asked to help the cops with a sting
operation by wearing a wire.

00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:31.270
Dorothy sensed that something was off and
when telling that to Ramona in the car, she

00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:33.340
just says she is paranoid.

00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:38.190
Police had no leads because none of the victimized
men wanted to confess, they were ashamed.

00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:43.800
In a newspaper there was an article about
an architect who had racked up a $135000 bill,

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:46.330
after four nights of pleasure he couldn’t
even remember.

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:49.390
Yes, he went back three more times.

00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:51.520
And so the girls were brought to the station.

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:54.080
Ramona, while withdrawing the money.

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:57.250
Mercedes, while visiting her fiance in prison.

00:09:57.250 --> 00:10:00.830
Annabelle, while in her apartment and Dorothy
at her home.

00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:06.350
Dorothy accepted the police’s deal, to guarantee
a safer future for her daughter, Lily.

00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:10.580
Months after the interview, pregnant Elizabeth
receives a call from Dorothy and asks about

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:13.360
Ramona and what she truly said about her.

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:17.120
Ramona’s protegee tears up when she hears
that her mentor kept her picture on her, among

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:19.840
the precious things she carries at all times.

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:23.550
Ramona never spoke ill of Dorothy, she was
always by her side.

00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:26.680
Elizabeth suggests that she should give her
a call.

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:31.750
Destiny pled guilty to grand larceny and attempted
assault in exchange for zero jail time.

00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:34.070
Ramona was sentenced to five years probation.

00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:38.700
Mercedes and Annabelle served weekends in
jail for four months and received five years

00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:39.940
probation.

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:42.800
Ramona ends the movie with a heartfelt comparison.

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:49.670
The whole country is a nightclub, with some
people throwing the money and others doing

00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:50.670
the dance.

00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:51.670
Everybody’s hustling.

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:52.670
The end.

00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:53.670
Thank you for watching!
