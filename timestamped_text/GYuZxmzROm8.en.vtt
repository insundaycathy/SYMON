00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.040
Detective Recapped here. Today, I'm going
to explain a Drama-Thriller film called: "Funny

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.790
Games." Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take
care.

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.320
George and Ann Farber have decided to spend
some time at their lake house with their son,

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.651
Georgie, and dog, Lucky. With their boat in
tow, the family heads to their vacation home

00:00:17.651 --> 00:00:21.560
with smiles on their faces. As they near their
property, the Farbers stop by their neighbor

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.619
Fred's house, asking if he's joining them
for golf the following day. Fred, who is with

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.230
his wife and two young men, says he will.
Ann then asks if he could give them a hand

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.230
launching their boat into the water, and Fred
says he'll meet them in 20 minutes. When the

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.240
Farbers drive away, Ann wonders why Fred seemed
different and who the men with him were. Georgie

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.870
then asks where his friend Jenny is, and his
mother tells him that she's probably at the

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.719
beach. When George suggests that the men may
be Fred's relatives, Ann drops the subject.

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.481
When they reach their house, Ann instructs
her son to take his stuff to his room. George

00:00:49.481 --> 00:00:53.449
enters the house with his golf clubs, and
the family settles in. Ann tells her husband

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:56.789
to take Lucky with him outside, and when he
does, George finds Fred and one of the men

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.539
from his house standing by the gate. As they
get in, George apologizes for their dog's

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.380
behavior, but the guests don't seem to mind.
Fred introduces Paul to George as the son

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:08.940
of one of his business associates. Ann then
calls Lucky, who won't stop barking at Paul,

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.620
before greeting Fred and asking him how Eve
is. Though he's a bit anxious, Fred says he's

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.070
fine, and Ann greets Paul, too.

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.310
As the men launch the boat into the water,
Georgie expresses his disappointment that

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.371
Jenny isn't with them. Georgie is upset because
Jenny has promised to be there with him, but

00:01:22.371 --> 00:01:26.400
George doesn't know what to say to his son.
In an attempt to comfort him, George promises

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.360
that they will ask Jenny's mother about her
the next day. Letting it go, Georgie asks

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.390
his father why Fred is acting strange.

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.360
Meanwhile, in the kitchen, Ann is talking
to her friend, Nancy, on the phone. As she

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.040
does, Georgie comes in and asks for a sharp
knife, immediately leaving after Ann gives

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.940
it to him. Ann then resumes her conversation
with her friend, urging her to drop by their

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.240
lake house. When Georgie comes back, she tells
Nancy to call her if ever she decides to come

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.950
over. Ann asks Georgie why he's back, and
the boy informs her that they have a visitor.

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.540
Ann goes to the door to see who it is, and
she finds the other man from Fred's house,

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.280
Peter. She then lets him in, asking what he
needs, and Peter shyly asks for eggs. He says

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.860
that Eve sent him over to see if Ann could
give her some.

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.780
Without hesitation, Ann prepares the eggs
then asks Peter how he got inside their property.

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.060
Peter says he got in down by the water, and
when Ann points out that he's not wet, he

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.670
adds that he went through the hole by the
fence. Not giving it much thought, Ann gives

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.950
Peter the eggs and asks him to give her regards
to Eve. However, Peter drops the eggs when

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.320
he's about to leave, and while Ann goes back
to the kitchen to get some towels for the

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.460
mess, Peter keeps looking around the house.
Peter apologizes to Ann as she cleans the

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.700
floor before casually asking for four more
eggs. Trying to be nice, Ann prepares the

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.500
other four eggs for Peter, and as she does,
Peter discreetly but purposely drops the house

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.710
phone in the sink. Ann quickly takes it out
of the water, and despite her irritation,

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.120
she just politely asks Peter to leave.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.290
Ann relaxes a little once Peter is gone, but
when she hears Lucky furiously barking outside,

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.150
she decides to check it out. She then discovers
that Lucky is barking at Peter and Paul, who

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.510
are still inside their house. She apologizes
to the young men, asking them if they're hurt,

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.061
and Peter claims that Lucky jumped on him.
Embarrassed, Ann asks if they want her to

00:02:58.061 --> 00:03:01.450
lock Lucky up so they can leave, but Paul
assures her it won't be necessary. He then

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.930
notices George's golf clubs, and when he asks
Ann if he can try using one outside, Ann reluctantly

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:06.980
lets him.

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.850
Outside, George and Georgie both wonder why
Lucky keeps on barking, shouting at the dog

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:15.160
to keep quiet. When the dog finally stops
making noise, George decides to take a look,

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.660
unknowingly dropping Georgie's borrowed knife
on the boat. When Ann goes outside to look

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.730
for Lucky, she bumps into Paul, who thanks
her for letting him use the club. As Ann is

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.280
about to return to the house, Paul asks her
if she's given the eggs to Tom, confusing

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.380
her. Paul then goes back to the Farbers' house
without invitation, and when Ann gets inside,

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:34.400
she tells the strangers to leave her out of
their game. Playing dumb, Paul asks Ann what

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.580
game she's talking about and if they've done
something to upset her. Fed up, Ann ignores

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.770
his question and tells them to leave, but
the guests insist on having the eggs first.

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:47.170
Taken aback by their audacity, she grabs Peter
by the arm just to make him leave. When George

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.390
finally arrives and asks what's happening,
Peter and Paul explain why they're there and

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:54.810
what they want, making Ann seem like the bad
guy. Georgie then arrives, too, and witnesses

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.770
the whole thing. To end the argument with
the guests, Ann retrieves four more eggs from

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:01.880
the kitchen and asks George to give them to
the men. Instead of just handing the eggs

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.880
to Paul, George asks her why she's so upset,
but Ann won't justify herself in front of

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.810
the strangers. When she finally goes into
another room, George apologizes to Peter and

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.760
Paul and nicely asks them to leave. But again,
the men are insistent on getting the eggs

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:19.170
first. Paul then insults George, prompting
George to slap the rude man. In retaliation,

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:21.209
Peter hits George in the legs with a golf
club.

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:24.100
Georgie rushes to his father's side as he
collapses on the floor before attacking the

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.780
strangers. But of course, he hardly causes
them any harm. Paul easily pins the kid to

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.840
the floor, asking him to behave himself before
he gets hurt. When Ann comes out of the room

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:36.900
and sees George down, Paul explains that her
husband slapped him. Ann and Georgie then

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.560
tend to George, and as they help him sit on
a chair, Paul insists on having Peter check

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.900
his leg since he's a medical student. However,
George just wants them gone, and when Paul

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.770
says neither he nor "Tom" will stop them from
calling an ambulance or the cops, Ann informs

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.520
her husband that Peter dropped the phone in
the sink.

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.990
Georgie is crying at this point, and George
demands to know why these strangers are tormenting

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.560
them, to which Paul announces that they'll
be playing a guessing game. He then shows

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.660
them a golf ball, asking them why he has it.
When the family doesn't answer, Peter says

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.060
Paul didn't get to hit it because something
stopped him. Proud of his friend's correct

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:09.440
answer, Paul arrogantly tells them he had
to use the club on something else, making

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.389
Ann realize that he killed Lucky.

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:14.770
Outside, Paul guides Ann as she looks for
Lucky, giving her hints so she'll quickly

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:19.160
find him. When Ann approaches their car, Paul
looks at his imaginary audience and smiles

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:23.840
before giving Ann more clues about Lucky's
location. Finally, Ann opens the car and gasps

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:28.270
when Lucky's body falls to the ground. Suddenly,
Ann's friends arrive at the dock, and Paul

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:32.210
tells her not to alert them. Ann then greets
Betsy and Robert, and Betsy introduces her

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:36.460
sister-in-law to Ann. Ann introduces Paul
to them, too, saying he's staying with their

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:40.460
neighbors, and when Betsy asks about George,
Ann lies and says he's resting after pulling

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:44.140
a muscle from putting up the mast. As Ann's
friends are about to leave, Paul asks them

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:48.180
where their dock is, and after Betsy tells
him where, she bids them goodbye. Back at

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:51.520
the house, Peter asks Georgie to get him some
food from the kitchen, warning him not to

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.330
try anything funny.

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:57.020
When Ann and Paul return, Ann tells them their
friends are coming over in two hours, but

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:01.040
Peter doesn't believe her, saying he heard
her conversation with Nancy in the kitchen.

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:04.540
Ann and Georgie then help George to the couch,
and when Peter and Paul continue hounding

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:08.650
them, Ann begs them to stop. Pleased with
Ann's politeness, Paul apologizes to George

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:12.610
for his behavior as Ann leaves the room to
get some painkillers. He then properly introduces

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:16.940
himself and Peter to George. But George ignores
them, so when Ann returns to give him some

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:20.860
medicine, Peter shoves her to the couch. With
Ann landing on his hurt body, George cries

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:25.530
in pain. Furious, Ann tries attacking Paul,
but he easily subdues her by punching her

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:29.630
in the gut while Peter steps on George's leg.
Georgie tries fighting back, too, but Paul

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:32.550
warns him to stop, threatening to hurt Ann
if he doesn't.

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:35.950
When everybody finally calms down, George
asks the strangers again why they're tormenting

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:40.260
them. Turning to his friend, Paul tells Peter
to answer George's question, but Peter starts

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:44.360
getting emotional and cries. Tired of Peter's
drama, Paul tells everyone that Peter is the

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:48.360
way he is because his mother divorced his
father when he was just a boy. Upset, Peter

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:52.220
says Paul is lying, but Paul keeps talking
about Peter's past, enjoying seeing his friend

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:57.229
in pain. As Paul continues using profanities,
George asks him to stop for his son's sake.

00:06:57.229 --> 00:07:01.080
Paul then complies, saying that none of what
he just said is even true. He then chuckles

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:05.220
when Peter finally smiles. As the Farbers
cry on the couch, Peter goes to the kitchen

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:08.710
to find something to eat. Paul then claims
that he and Peter are drug addicts who like

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:12.420
to rob wealthy families in their vacation
homes to support their habit. Paul asks Peter

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:15.550
for the time as he returns from the kitchen
with snacks, and when Peter tells him it's

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:18.610
already past eight, Paul announces that they
will have a bet.

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:21.870
He tells the Farbers to bet that they will
still be alive after 12 hours, while he and

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:26.920
Peter will bet that they'll be dead. Confused,
Ann looks to her husband, who is equally befuddled.

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:30.580
Paul then looks to the imaginary camera and
talks to the imaginary audience, asking them

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:34.270
if they think the Farbers stand a chance.
Tired and hurt, George tells them to just

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:37.650
get their money and leave, saying Fred and
Eve will eventually come over to check on

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:41.530
them. However, Paul completely ignores him,
while Peter asks Ann to cook some food for

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:45.810
them. Irritated, Paul tells him to watch his
weight, and Peter gets offended, telling Paul

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:49.750
to stop making fun of his body. Their attention
then shifts to Ann's body, and when she gets

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:53.680
offended, she tries to walk out of the room.
Georgie attempts to do the same, but Peter

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:57.780
grabs him. Paul asks for his name, and when
the boy answers, Paul announces that they'll

00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:02.270
play another game. Ann protests, but Paul
ignores her and puts a pillowcase over Georgie's

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:06.199
head. Peter grabs Ann as she tries to stop
them, and while Georgie struggles to break

00:08:06.199 --> 00:08:09.810
free from him, Paul assures them that nothing
bad will happen to the kid.

00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:13.370
To start the game, Paul tells Ann to undress
for them, but when she doesn't, Paul bends

00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:17.990
one of Georgie's fingers, making the boy scream.
George begs Paul to stop, but Paul only continues

00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:22.090
to hurt Georgie. Paul then orders George to
get his wife to undress, and with no other

00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:26.449
choice, George tells Ann to remove her clothes.
While the strangers watch, Ann cries as she

00:08:26.449 --> 00:08:30.520
takes her clothes off. Once Ann is completely
unclothed, Paul compliments her for being

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:35.010
fit before asking her to get dressed again.
Humiliated, Ann does as she's told, while

00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:38.759
Paul tells Peter to take Georgie to the bathroom
after the kid peed in his pants. As Peter

00:08:38.759 --> 00:08:42.419
is about to take Georgie away, Ann and George
attack the men, giving the boy a chance to

00:08:42.419 --> 00:08:46.110
run away. Georgie goes upstairs and escapes
through the balcony while Peter and Paul are

00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:50.050
binding his parents. Paul then leaves to find
Georgie, who tries and fails to climb over

00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:53.679
the gate. Georgie waddles through the waters
and goes to Fred's house, then immediately

00:08:53.679 --> 00:08:57.720
hides inside once he sees Paul coming. When
Georgie notices the water trail he's left

00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:01.790
on the floor, he quickly removes his shoes
and pants to avoid being followed. Georgie

00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:06.029
then hides in one of the rooms, where he notices
a gun in the hallway. As he is about to get

00:09:06.029 --> 00:09:10.089
it, he sees a dead body lying on the bathroom
floor, causing him to panic and hide again.

00:09:10.089 --> 00:09:14.579
However, he returns to the hallway to retrieve
the gun before finally going back into hiding.

00:09:14.579 --> 00:09:17.829
When Georgie decides to leave the room, he
unluckily comes face to face with Paul in

00:09:17.829 --> 00:09:21.920
the hallway. Georgie begs him not to go near
him, but Paul just calmly instructs Georgie

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:25.839
to cock the gun while walking toward him.
Scared, Georgie points the gun at Paul, and

00:09:25.839 --> 00:09:30.600
when Paul tells him to pull the trigger, the
boy obeys. Unfortunately, the gun is not loaded,

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:34.610
leaving Georgie in more trouble. Meanwhile,
with Peter briefly leaving the room, Ann hops

00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:38.649
over to George to get her husband to unbind
her. Unfortunately, Peter quickly returns

00:09:38.649 --> 00:09:42.869
and stops them, dropping the carton of eggs
in the process. Trying her luck, Ann begs

00:09:42.869 --> 00:09:46.269
Peter to let them go, but the young man won't
listen to her and says she's only degrading

00:09:46.269 --> 00:09:47.600
herself.

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:51.570
When Paul and Georgie return, the kid tells
his mother that Jenny is dead. As Paul gives

00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:54.879
Fred's hunting rifle to Peter, he informs
Georgie's parents that their son tried to

00:09:54.879 --> 00:09:59.059
kill him. Paul then asks Peter what time it
is, and when Peter says it's already after

00:09:59.059 --> 00:10:03.110
11, Paul suggests they resume their game.
After they load the gun, Paul starts choosing

00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:07.100
who among the Farbers they will shoot first,
leaving the poor family in tears. Unable to

00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:11.040
decide, Paul goes to the kitchen to fix himself
a sandwich, while Peter continues to select

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:15.300
which of the three he'll kill. The gun suddenly
goes off while Paul is preparing his food,

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:18.660
but he just ignores it and continues what
he's doing. The couple's screams then follow

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:22.459
the sound, and when Paul returns to the living
room, he scolds Peter for not following the

00:10:22.459 --> 00:10:26.269
rules and shooting the wrong person. However,
Peter argues that the person he shot tried

00:10:26.269 --> 00:10:29.740
to run away, but Paul is having none of it.
After learning that it's almost midnight,

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:33.300
Paul decides that it's time for them to leave,
and he casually tells them to have a nice

00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:34.300
evening.

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:38.920
Once the intruders leave, neither George nor
Ann moves. Eventually, Ann gets to her senses,

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:43.041
so she hops around the house to turn off the
television. As Ann kneels on the floor, she

00:10:43.041 --> 00:10:47.000
avoids looking at her son's dead body. She
tells George that the intruders are gone,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.910
but he doesn't answer her. Ann makes her way
to the kitchen by hopping and manages to unbind

00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:54.819
herself before returning to the living room
with a knife. George weeps, and though Ann

00:10:54.819 --> 00:10:58.999
is comforting him, she encourages him to get
himself together before the men come back.

00:10:58.999 --> 00:11:02.279
Despite his pain, George lets Ann help him
get up, only to realize that they're locked

00:11:02.279 --> 00:11:06.660
inside the house. Frustrated, George tells
Ann to just leave him since he's dead weight,

00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:11.709
but Ann opposes, saying the gate is probably
locked, too. Realizing his wife might be right,

00:11:11.709 --> 00:11:15.189
George instructs Ann to get the pliers and
cut through the fence, reminding her to be

00:11:15.189 --> 00:11:18.999
careful. He then tells her to get dressed,
and as Ann puts on her clothes, George informs

00:11:18.999 --> 00:11:21.749
her he'll hide in the cellar and wait for
her to come back.

00:11:21.749 --> 00:11:25.110
Before leaving, Ann realizes that her phone
is already getting a signal, but she fails

00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:29.179
to make a call. With George's phone in the
car, Ann desperately tries to make hers work

00:11:29.179 --> 00:11:33.230
by wiping it with a towel before deciding
to use a hairdryer on it. When George informs

00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:37.759
her that the phone still isn't working, Ann
suddenly throws up, making George feel bad.

00:11:37.759 --> 00:11:41.649
After cleaning herself, Ann tries with the
hairdryer again. With the attempt still ending

00:11:41.649 --> 00:11:45.809
in a failure, George tells her not to waste
any more time. He asks Ann to help move him

00:11:45.809 --> 00:11:50.089
further into the kitchen, and after that,
Ann prepares to leave. George asks for Ann's

00:11:50.089 --> 00:11:53.680
forgiveness before she goes, but Ann only
cries and kisses George, telling him how much

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:55.100
she loves him.

00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:58.629
As Ann cuts her way through the fence, she
tries screaming for help, but nobody hears

00:11:58.629 --> 00:12:02.660
her. She then walks on the road, and when
she sees a car approaching her, Ann decides

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:06.980
to hide behind a tree. When she sees the vehicle
that has just passed isn't the intruders',

00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:11.459
Ann tries calling it back for help, but the
car is already too far away. However, it isn't

00:12:11.459 --> 00:12:16.069
long when another car shows up. Meanwhile,
George finally manages to call 911, but the

00:12:16.069 --> 00:12:20.040
operator can't understand him. Realizing that
it's just useless, George gives up on his

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:23.949
second attempt to make a call. He then goes
to the living room to put a blanket over Georgie's

00:12:23.949 --> 00:12:28.140
dead body, and when he's about to sit, he
notices a golf ball rolling on the floor.

00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:32.239
Peter and Paul return with Ann, who is once
again bound and gagged. After beating up George

00:12:32.239 --> 00:12:36.110
and learning that he has managed to call 911,
Paul reminds Peter to shoot the right person

00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:37.110
in their next game.

00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:40.720
Paul then removes Ann's gag and tells her
the rules of their new game, but George instructs

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:44.689
his wife not to cooperate and just let the
men do whatever they want with them. Annoyed,

00:12:44.689 --> 00:12:48.410
Paul asks the audience if they think the Farbers
have already had enough, only to proceed with

00:12:48.410 --> 00:12:52.009
the game anyway. Paul wants Ann to decide
which person will die next and whether that

00:12:52.009 --> 00:12:56.410
person will die by a gun or knife. When Ann
doesn't answer, Paul orders Peter to hurt

00:12:56.410 --> 00:13:00.779
George, pushing Ann to spit at Paul. Crying,
Ann asks Paul what to do, and the young man

00:13:00.779 --> 00:13:05.350
tells her to say a prayer. However, Ann doesn't
know any prayers, so Paul asks Peter to teach

00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:09.639
her one. When Paul repeats the prayer to Ann
and asks her to kneel, Ann finally recites

00:13:09.639 --> 00:13:13.920
the short prayer while sobbing. Impressed,
Paul asks Ann to say the prayer backwards,

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:17.889
but Ann sees an opportunity to grab the gun.
She immediately shoots Peter, leaving Paul

00:13:17.889 --> 00:13:21.249
to scream as his friend gets shot. He then
takes the gun from Ann before hitting her

00:13:21.249 --> 00:13:25.189
with it. Paul frantically searches the living
room for the remote control, and upon finding

00:13:25.189 --> 00:13:29.139
it, he presses the rewind button. He fully
breaks the fourth wall with this, and they

00:13:29.139 --> 00:13:32.989
go back in time to prevent Peter's death.
Back to when Ann attempts to grab the gun,

00:13:32.989 --> 00:13:37.410
Paul easily gets it first. He's annoyed now
that Ann broke the rules, so he shoots George

00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:38.470
without remorse.

00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:42.850
The next day, Peter and Paul take Ann to the
boat, where she remains bound and gagged.

00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:46.249
Once they sail, Ann notices the knife that
George has dropped earlier and tries to cut

00:13:46.249 --> 00:13:50.620
herself free. Unfortunately, the men quickly
notice what she's doing, and Peter takes the

00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:54.839
knife away from her before tossing it away.
He then helps Ann sit between him and Paul,

00:13:54.839 --> 00:13:58.499
and as he talks about being inside a black
hole, Paul asks him for the time. When Peter

00:13:58.499 --> 00:14:02.519
tells him it's already after 8, Paul kisses
Ann before casually pushing her overboard.

00:14:02.519 --> 00:14:06.649
Surprised, Peter asks why Paul did it since
Ann still has some time left, and Paul just

00:14:06.649 --> 00:14:10.620
chuckles, saying he's getting hungry. The
intruders then sail to Betsy's place, where

00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:14.079
Paul tells Betsy that Ann has sent him, and
he reminds her that they met the previous

00:14:14.079 --> 00:14:18.249
day. Paul then asks Betsy for eggs, saying
that Ann needs them, and the clueless woman

00:14:18.249 --> 00:14:28.540
lets him inside the house. As Betsy goes to
the kitchen to get the eggs, Paul looks around

00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:32.980
the house before creepily staring into the
camera.
