00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:15.920
In Istanbul, MI6 agents James Bond and&nbsp;
Eve Moneypenny pursue mercenary Patrice,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:22.000
who has stolen a hard drive containing details&nbsp;
of undercover agents. As Bond and Patrice fight&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.760
atop a moving train, M orders Moneypenny to&nbsp;
shoot Patrice, despite not having a clear shot;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.600
Moneypenny inadvertently hits&nbsp;
Bond, who falls into a river.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.440
Bond is presumed dead and Patrice&nbsp;
escapes with the hard drive.&nbsp;

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.560
Three months later, due to a public inquiry&nbsp;
into M's handling of the stolen hard drive,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:45.280
she is pressured to retire by Gareth Mallory,&nbsp;
the chairman of the Intelligence and Security&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.960
Committee of Parliament and a former SAS&nbsp;
officer. Although she claims she is still useful,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.000
MI6's servers are hacked, and M receives&nbsp;
a taunting computer message moments before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.240
the MI6 building explodes. Bond, who used his&nbsp;
presumed death to retire, learns of the attack and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:09.200
returns to service in London. He fails a series of&nbsp;
physical, medical, and psychological examinations,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.240
but M approves his return to the field,&nbsp;
ordering him to identify Patrice's employer,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:20.560
recover the hard drive, and kill Patrice. He&nbsp;
meets Q, MI6's new quartermaster, who gives&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:26.800
him a radio beacon and a Walther PPK pistol.
In Shanghai, Bond follows Patrice but is unable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:32.240
to prevent him killing a target. The two fight and&nbsp;
Patrice falls to his death before Bond can learn&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:38.080
his employer's identity. Bond finds a casino token&nbsp;
Patrice intended to cash in for the assassination,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:44.560
leading him to a casino in Macau. There, Bond&nbsp;
is approached by Sévérine, Patrice's accomplice.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:50.400
Recognising her tattoo, he concludes she was a sex&nbsp;
slave "rescued" by a criminal who now employs her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.360
a man Bond wishes to meet. She warns him he&nbsp;
is targeted by her bodyguards, but promises&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:01.040
to help if Bond kills her employer. Bond thwarts&nbsp;
the attack and joins Sévérine on her yacht, the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:06.320
Chimera. They travel to an abandoned island off&nbsp;
the coast of Macau, where the crew captures and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:14.000
delivers them to Sévérine's employer, Raoul Silva.&nbsp;
Once an MI6 agent, Silva turned to cyberterrorism&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.480
and orchestrated the attack on MI6. Silva kills&nbsp;
Sévérine, but Bond alerts MI6 reinforcements&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:26.160
who capture Silva for rendition to Britain.
At MI6's new underground headquarters,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.760
Q attempts to decrypt Silva's laptop, but&nbsp;
inadvertently gives it access to the MI6 servers,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:37.600
allowing Silva to escape. Q concludes Silva&nbsp;
wanted to be captured as part of a plan to kill M,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:43.600
whom he resents for disavowing and betraying him&nbsp;
to the Chinese government in 1997, leaving him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:49.680
to be tortured and disfigured. Bond chases Silva&nbsp;
through the London Underground and thwarts Silva's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:55.760
attack at a Parliament inquiry where M is present.
Instructing Q and Bill Tanner to leave an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:02.560
electronic trail for Silva to follow, Bond&nbsp;
uses his Aston Martin DB5 to take M to Skyfall,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.920
his childhood home in the Scottish Highlands.&nbsp;
They meet Skyfall's gamekeeper Kincade,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.920
and together the trio set up a series&nbsp;
of booby traps throughout the house.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:19.520
When Silva's men arrive, Bond, M, and Kincade kill&nbsp;
most of them, but M is wounded. Silva arrives by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:25.440
helicopter with more men and heavy weapons, so&nbsp;
Bond sends M and Kincade through a priest hole&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:31.520
to hide in a nearby chapel, and rigs propane tanks&nbsp;
to explode. As the house and the helicopter are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:37.200
destroyed, Bond escapes down the same tunnel.
Silva survives the destruction of the house,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.640
following Kincade and M to the chapel.&nbsp;
Confronting M, Silva forces his gun into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:48.160
her hand and presses his temple to hers, begging&nbsp;
her to kill them both. Bond arrives and kills&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:54.320
Silva by throwing a knife into his back. M then&nbsp;
succumbs to her wounds and dies in Bond's arms.&nbsp;

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:58.640
Following M's funeral, Moneypenny&nbsp;
formally introduces herself to Bond&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.960
and tells him she is retiring from&nbsp;
fieldwork to become secretary for Mallory,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:10.640
the newly appointed M. Bond meets with Mallory,&nbsp;
and tells him he is ready to get back to work.
