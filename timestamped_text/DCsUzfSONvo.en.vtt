to his van but he didn't start his van for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:48.800
very long and he stayed in his van for quite&nbsp;
a while the girl inside the car realized that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:56.320
something was wrong and doubted him but before&nbsp;
she could start her car the man came to her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:12.240
with him when the girl woke up she discovered&nbsp;
herself in another place the man took her as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:19.760
a hostage she realized he was about to kill&nbsp;
her she told him i'm pregnant and i have a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:28.160
baby inside my belly but still he didn't show any&nbsp;
mercy to her and killed her so brutally some days&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:36.000
later the police found pieces of her dead body&nbsp;
actually her father was a detective for the past&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:44.720
30 years and he became very sad about it even&nbsp;
through he was working as a detective for 30 years&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:52.480
he still could not save his daughter's life then&nbsp;
he said to kim soo forgive me i couldn't save&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.480 --> 00:03:00.560
her kim so was her finance and loved her very much&nbsp;
kimsu was very depressed and broken after his wife&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:09.280
died he had tears in his eyes but he didn't let&nbsp;
anyone notice his tears he was very calm and it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:17.520
was like the calm before the storm he takes two&nbsp;
weeks of vacation from this job actually kim su&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:25.600
was an agent of the national intelligence agency&nbsp;
and one of his colleagues came to meet him then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:34.000
he gave him a capsule and told him whoever has his&nbsp;
capsule with them you can see their exact location&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:42.240
on your phone and you can also hear everything&nbsp;
around them but if someone gets to know about it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:48.880
then both of us will be in huge trouble kim su&nbsp;
said don't worry nothing's going to happen and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:56.160
then kimsu left kim so went to his father-in-law&nbsp;
to talk about his murdered finance hang joo yoon&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:03.360
then her father who was a detective told him that&nbsp;
we have already arrested four people for this kind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:10.000
of case then he gave him their photos and detail&nbsp;
schemes who left with the details and photos&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:17.040
then he tortured two of them so brutally but then&nbsp;
he realized that none of them were the killer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:25.200
then he went to third suspect's house and he had&nbsp;
already left his house and his kids his parents&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:33.280
don't know where he is when kim soo was leaving&nbsp;
the house he saw the son of that third suspect and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:39.920
his son was suspicious as well then he asked&nbsp;
him do you know where your father is right now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:47.920
he told him his location kim su went to that place&nbsp;
where the suspect lives when he was searching his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:57.440
whole room he found a lot of girl stuff in his&nbsp;
dryers then he searched the whole house and found&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:05.760
the ring in the drain this was the ring which&nbsp;
kimsu gave to his finance kim so got so emotional&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:14.160
to see his ring and realized it was the house of&nbsp;
murderer who killed his finance on the other side&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:21.520
we saw zhang kyung chul the psycho killer who&nbsp;
killed his finance he was going somewhere with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:28.640
girl in his bus in the bus there was a girl and&nbsp;
jong kyung chul was creepily looking at her he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:35.840
has already killed another girl and at night we&nbsp;
saw that one girl was missing from the school bus&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:43.200
and jong kyung the psycho killer had kidnapped&nbsp;
this girl he took her to his house while young&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:50.400
was sexually assaulting her someone called his&nbsp;
name from the back and young stopped then he went&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:58.960
outside and turned the lights on then he saw that&nbsp;
kim su was standing in front of him young asked&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:05.840
him are you alone kim soo didn't answer him&nbsp;
young told him maybe you are a police officer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:15.520
i am surprised that the police found me so early&nbsp;
but you don't have any idea about who i am and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:23.120
then young started running toward kimsu and he had&nbsp;
a knife in his hand but before he could attack him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:31.200
so he got saved from his knife and then beat him&nbsp;
so badly even though young attacked him too many&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:38.720
times kim was so trained he beat him so badly and&nbsp;
then wrapped his face with plastic as a result he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:46.240
started choking but kim soo didn't let him go&nbsp;
but when young was about to die he let him go&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:54.400
then kim so found a big rock in front of him&nbsp;
and he was about to kill him with that rock&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:54.400 --> 00:07:03.440
but he didn't and then kim soo put that capsule&nbsp;
in young's mouth so that he can track and listen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:12.400
to everything of young but young didn't notice it&nbsp;
because he was unconscious and just like that kim&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:20.640
su saved a girl's life then young woke up he found&nbsp;
an envelope in his hand inside that envelope there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:26.480
was a lot of money he laughed at the money&nbsp;
and said this police officer was a psycho&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:34.880
and then he left while walking on the road he&nbsp;
found a taxi and asked for a lift there were two&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:41.600
other main inside the taxi on the other side kim&nbsp;
soo was watching his location because he can see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:48.160
every action of yang in his phone what he is doing&nbsp;
what he is talking about kim su can track all of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:55.120
this and kim so also started to follow him the&nbsp;
other two men who were in the taxi young killed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:55.120 --> 00:08:02.160
them and then he opened the trunk then he saw that&nbsp;
there was already a dead body inside the trunk&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:08.960
which means these two were also criminals like him&nbsp;
they were driving through the highway to through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:14.800
someone's dead body after killing him young left&nbsp;
these three bodies on the road and left with a car&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:22.880
young was injured so he went to a doctor then he&nbsp;
saw a nurse there and he was so too har when the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:30.000
nurse went into an isolated room young was already&nbsp;
there then he closed to the door from inside and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:37.360
the nurse got so scared he told her last night&nbsp;
i was about to have fun with a girl but a guy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:45.920
came there and destroyed all of my plans and now i&nbsp;
don't want to lose my chance to have fun with you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:53.680
the nurse requested him to let her go but young&nbsp;
was a psycho so he does not care about anything or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:53.680 --> 00:09:02.400
anyone he has no mercy he is an animal in a human&nbsp;
body but before he could sexually abuse her kimsu&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:09.840
came there and then kimsu hit his head from the&nbsp;
back with a cylinder and then he beat young so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:18.400
badly when young was like half dead the nurse was&nbsp;
trying to get away from him but kimsu told her to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:26.800
stay she needs to treat him and bandage his owns&nbsp;
then he said to young this is the just beginning&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:35.120
it won't stop soon and this will cost you so much&nbsp;
and then kim soo cuts one of his legs so badly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:43.040
that his soul also got scared of it he was&nbsp;
screaming so loudly in pain in the next scene we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:52.240
saw young was getting out of his car by dragging&nbsp;
his body his leg was injured so badly and his hand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:59.840
was also broken he cannot walk properly and he&nbsp;
doesn't know why kim su is doing this to him and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:08.000
he was so confused about how he always gets his&nbsp;
exact location he thinks he has some transmitter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:16.240
device in his body he checked his shoe and his&nbsp;
whole car but he found nothing and then he starts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:24.320
driving on the highway now he wants to change his&nbsp;
car because he thinks there's something in the car&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:32.160
that was giving kimsu his exact location he&nbsp;
stopped another car but it was the army's car&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:39.600
so he didn't do anything in the next scene we saw&nbsp;
that kim su gets a call from his father-in-law&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:46.320
and told him now you should stop following yang&nbsp;
you have punished him enough now the police will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:52.320
punish him but kim su doesn't want to stop&nbsp;
he wants to hurt him so badly like he hurt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:52.320 --> 00:11:00.000
his fiancee and others on the other side we saw&nbsp;
the young was in a room with two of his friends&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:06.880
one of them was a girl and the other was a&nbsp;
boy and they were so psycho like young young&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:15.600
told them his story how a man was torturing him&nbsp;
and leaving him as well young's friend said he is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:23.120
hunting you he must be one of someone's family&nbsp;
members whom you killed and then young goes to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:31.360
a room and starts thinking about who is this man&nbsp;
is then he remembered that kim soo had a ring on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:39.040
his finger he also remembered whose ring it was&nbsp;
now young understood why he was being tortured&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:46.160
so much on the other side we saw that young's&nbsp;
friend died the owner of that house they were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:54.960
staying in he look that girl to the kitchen and&nbsp;
before he could kill her kimsu comes their young's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:54.960 --> 00:12:02.560

came inside without making any noise and then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:10.320
kim soo beat out of him and then young also came&nbsp;
there all of them started fighting but kimsu beat&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:18.160
them so badly that they were almost dead and&nbsp;
they were so injured that he could never kill&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:24.880
anyone in the future and then he again beat&nbsp;
out of young and young was screaming loudly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:32.400
in pain the next morning we saw that the police&nbsp;
came into the house and arrested all of them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:38.720
all of them were injured so badly that's why&nbsp;
they took them to the hospital kim so was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:46.080
also injured a bit then his friend came there&nbsp;
to meet him he asked him why don't you just hand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:55.120
over this man to the police kim su said no not now&nbsp;
i will not leave him until i get my revenge on him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:55.120 --> 00:13:01.840
for his crime then his friend told him the capsule&nbsp;
will keep working until he gets constipated&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:10.000
kimsu told him to stay quiet because young&nbsp;
so beside him kim soo went to him and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:17.760
pulled the cover from his face yang was totally&nbsp;
unconscious but actually young was not unconscious&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:26.080
at all he was just acting like he was unconscious&nbsp;
and he heard everything he realized that he had a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:34.080
transmitter in his body and that's how kim su&nbsp;
was getting his exact location every time and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:40.800
then kimsu left young in a very quiet place&nbsp;
so that he could try to commit another crime&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:48.960
and he can teach him a lesson once again but now&nbsp;
young knows everything he knows who kim su was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:57.440
he knows why he was taking device on him and he&nbsp;
also knows that he has a transmitter in his body&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:04.960
and he can still listen to him then say to him i&nbsp;
know you can hear me i have never played any game&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:12.400
like this in my whole life now it will be more&nbsp;
fun i know you are taking revenge on me because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:20.000
of the girl and i know the location of her house&nbsp;
too now you will regret your whole life because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:26.640
you didn't kill me when you had the&nbsp;
chance i forgot to tell you one thing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:34.320
when i was killing your fiance she told me she&nbsp;
was pregnant maybe you didn't know this kim soo&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:42.320
actually didn't know about it yang told him she&nbsp;
begged me to spare her life but i didn't spare&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:49.920
her you should have been with her to save her&nbsp;
and then young went to chemist and brought&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:56.240
some medicine for loose motion then he took out&nbsp;
the capsule from his body he put the capsule in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:56.240 --> 00:15:03.280
someone else's body before kimsu went there young&nbsp;
had run away from there now young doesn't know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:11.280
anything about where he is and what he is doing&nbsp;
then kimsu went to his psycho friend and asked him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:17.680
where young was he told him you don't understand&nbsp;
young he will give you back the pain you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:26.640
gave him which means now he will kill the whole&nbsp;
family of your fiance once he kills them all then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:33.920
you will have no regret if you catch him then&nbsp;
kim soo left the hospital and then kim su's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:41.200
colleagues received a call from young he told him&nbsp;
that young called him on the wireless and told him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:48.800
he had some unfinished business and after he&nbsp;
finished it he will surrender to the police&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:55.920
kimsu asked for young's location but when he told&nbsp;
him his location came so god so worried because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:55.920 --> 00:16:02.720
it was the location where his fiance's family&nbsp;
lives and now kim soo knows that young want&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:10.320
to kill his fiance's family and young's friends&nbsp;
who is also a psycho like him told kim soo that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:18.560
young gets much happier when he hurts someone so&nbsp;
badly which means if young can find her family&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:25.680
then he will kill them very slowly and painfully&nbsp;
and that's why kim su wants to get there before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:32.160
young but kim soo couldn't get there before young&nbsp;
then went to his fiance's house and injured his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:40.480
fiance's father so badly he also killed fiance's&nbsp;
sister and left kim su came there and saw all of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:47.920
this kimsu get so sad he realized his mistake if&nbsp;
he had killed him earlier then he wouldn't have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:54.800
to see this on the other hand young wants to&nbsp;
surrender himself to the police so he called&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:54.800 --> 00:17:02.400
the police and said that i want to surrender and&nbsp;
then give them a location young wants to surrender&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:10.800
to the police so that kimsu cannot have revenge on&nbsp;
him so he will keep regretting it his whole life&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:17.040
and in this game young will be the actual winner&nbsp;
then young went to the police where the police&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:22.640
were waiting for him before the police&nbsp;
could get him kim su came there and took&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:29.520
him in his car and left then kimsu took him&nbsp;
to that house where he killed his fiancee&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:37.040
he tied him to the exact same place where he&nbsp;
killed all the girls kim su tortured him so badly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:45.440
young asked him to kill him he said why are you&nbsp;
not killing me but kim su said i don't want to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:53.440
end this game so easily if i wanted to kill you&nbsp;
then i could have killed you earlier i will kill&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:53.440 --> 00:18:00.160
you when you feel the most pain of your life when&nbsp;
you will have fear in your eyes that will be my&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:06.080
revenge young says leave me please don't kill&nbsp;
me you have already punished me so much but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:13.040
then kimsu told him you must have heard this line&nbsp;
so many times from others and now feel this pain&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:19.840
kim so asked him are you afraid but then young&nbsp;
started laughing and said i don't have any fear&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:26.480
or feeling of pain inside me you know this&nbsp;
you have lost everything kimsu said i want to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:33.120
feel pain even after you die and then kimsu&nbsp;
closed the door and put a rope on his mouth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:42.080
actually where he was tied he had a blade above&nbsp;
him and if someone pulled the rope from his mouth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:50.560
then the blade would fall on his neck and cut&nbsp;
it off and then other end of this rope was tied&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:57.360
to the door which means if someone opens the door&nbsp;
the blade will fall on his neck and cut it off&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:07.920
kim soo set everything up and left when he got&nbsp;
outside he saw a taxi behind him young's parents&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:15.520
and his son were in that taxi young was saying&nbsp;
i will stay alive and you cannot kill me&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:24.160
i am not scared of anyone already kim su placed&nbsp;
that capsule in his body and that's how he could&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:32.080
hear everything that young says and then young saw&nbsp;
that his family was standing outside they saw him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:38.000
and they wanted to go inside to save him young&nbsp;
wanted to tell them not to come inside but if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:45.680
he lets go of the rope from his mouth then&nbsp;
the blade above his neck will fall on his neck&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:53.200
young's family want to save him but they didn't&nbsp;
know that if they opened the door the rope would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:53.200 --> 00:20:00.240
get pulled and the blade would fall on his neck&nbsp;
this was the moment where young had the fear of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:09.440
death in his eye he has caused his pain and fear&nbsp;
to so many people and now he is in that situation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:18.880

the door but he cannot talk but when his parents&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:25.520
were opening the door from the outside then slowly&nbsp;
the rope started to loosen from his mouth and when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:33.840
they opened the door the blade fell on his neck&nbsp;
and that's how young died kim su was listening to&nbsp;&nbsp;
