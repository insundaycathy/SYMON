00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.150
Welcome To The BREAKDOWN, Where We Breakdown
and Recap The Most Messed Up Shit!

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.270
Today we are watching Eraserhead, a surreal
film about this guy named Henry who gets forced

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:18.320
to marriage and to take care of a...child....If
you want to see what happens in this movie

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:24.820
and learn the details, stay tuned for the
breakdown!

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:31.539
The movie starts out with a nice peekaboo
segment between us and Eraserhead over here,

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:35.600
and then he's just acting all weird in front
of this meatball of a planet.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.180
Then after a slow zoom to the moon, we capture
its landscape before picking up with this

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:41.180
weirdo.

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.810
He seems to be watching Eraserhead who just
threw up this sperm looking thing and then

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:49.450
picks up some shotgun levers that brings the
sperm baby to a puddle.

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:51.600
Then it zooms into the light, and Eraserhead
pops into the frame!

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.680
It looks like Eraserhead is going back somewhere,
then he messes up the latest editions of What

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:57.680
Are Thoses?

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:03.020
Then after more walking and more walking and
more walking, he's back home at his apartment

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.130
building and then stands in the elevator awkwardly.

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.280
Now at his room, a sexy lil momma asks if
he is Henry and tells him Mary invited him

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.000
to dinner with her family, but he wants to
be as awkward as possible...but she likes

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.000
it!

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.300
Then after sitting awkwardly in the dark,
he plays his favorite 90's rap while contemplating

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.580
what pornstar he wants to jerk off too.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.450
Then he arranges a ripped up photo which is
possibly Mary which might tell him her address.

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:29.450
Then he shakes the spot.

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.910
He gets to her house and they have a little
spat about how she never comes around anymore,

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.030
before having a staring competition.

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.720
We meet the mother of Mary who isn't very
welcoming to Henry, then we see some doggies

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.960
getting some milk as they all sit awkwardly.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:49.420
Then Mary starts getting this weird seizure
and the dad comes in and he's already my favorite

00:01:49.420 --> 00:02:01.220
character.

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:06.700
Now on to the awkward chicken dinner, the
dad of Mary asks Henry to cut the fist sized

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:07.700
chicken.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.940
As soon as he touches it, the chicken starts
bleeding and grooving, causing the mom to

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.019
do this weird mating call..

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:17.129
As more blood leaks, the wife loses.

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:18.200
Mom: Screams!

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.950
Dad: She'll be alright in a minute.

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.140
Well he wasn't lying, she asks to speak with
Henry as these two look at him awkwardly,

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.620
then the lights flicker.

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.810
The mom grabs him and asks if he smashed Mary.

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.069
She forces him to tell the truth, but then
we he doesn't, she starts making out with

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:36.980
his neck before snapping out of it!

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.980
She tells him he has a baby, while the daughter
says it doesn't even look like a baby.

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.840
Then he gets a nosebleed in response, I don't
blame him, if I knew I had a baby right now,

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.800
I'd probably do the same.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.689
Then we see Mary feeding some weird creature
making baby goat noises.

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:56.450
It spits out all the food that Mary gives
it, what the hell is this creature?

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.709
Back with Henry, he examines some worm creature
as Mary watches the baby.

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:04.590
He examines his radiator closely again and
we then cut to a stage.

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.620
Then at night, Mary gets irritated at the
baby crying and tells it to shut up multiple

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:10.620
times.

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.260
Then she proclaims she can't stand it saying
she wants a decents night sleep, leaving Henry

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:16.879
to care for the Alien baby.

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:21.629
Then she weirdly messes with his bed but its
actually her getting a suitcase, she don left

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:22.829
his ass for the night!

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:27.659
Well the good thing is that Henry manages
to quiet the baby, but then the alien baby

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:29.640
gets all sick!

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.950
The next morning, everytime Henry tries to
leave the baby, it starts crying, which is

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:34.319
understandable.

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:35.629
So he sits with it.

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:40.319
Then after misery, it cuts to a dancing lady
with weird ball shaped cheeks dancing next

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:41.480
to the sperm from the beginning.

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:47.239
Then she completely squishes one sperm and
then another while keeping her demented smile.

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:52.269
Back with this lovely couple, they ramble
about in bed but Henry notices sperm things

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:55.049
from that vision and he throws em against
the wall!

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:59.219
Then after a weird sequence, he gets a knock
on the door from his neighbor, I told yall

00:03:59.219 --> 00:04:00.519
she wanted it!

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:05.310
She starts lusting for him and the baby starts
crying forcing him to quiet it down!

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.400
She asks where his wife is and then she asks
to spend the night.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.590
They get to the intercourse and she notices
his baby as they sink into his bed.

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:17.989
Then next the ball cheeks lady or the Lady
in The Radiator comes out and sings this song

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:21.810
which has been stuck in my head for a while...

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:31.760
Its kinda hot aint it?

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:39.720
Not her, the song!

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.450
Henry walks up on stage and they share a weird
moment filled with blinding flashing lights.

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:49.420
Then Henry basically hallucinates that Space
Man from the beginning and sperms!

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:54.240
He hides behind a railing but gets beheaded
by something that resembles the baby and then

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.390
his head sinks as the baby cries supernaturally!

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:01.850
He falls in front of a boy who grabs the head
and takes it to some man who keeps beeping

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:02.920
this alert.

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:07.710
They take the head to another man and he drills
into it, grabbing some head meat which proves

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:11.500
to be a good eraser, hence the name of the
movie!

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.880
Finally, Henry wakes back up and he watches
some man outside.

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.570
Then he listens outside his door.

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:23.070
After some laying down realizations, he goes
to find solace with the neighbor but realizes

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:26.140
she wasn't feeling him, this is what she sees.

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:30.920
After some time, he takes scissors and cuts
open the fabric bandages around the baby as

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:36.260
it convulses, but what opens is the babies
entire torso cavity or whatever.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.060
We see its organs and everything.

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:40.730
Henry stabs its heart and it bleeds.

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:45.540
Then the baby coughs out blood and then he
fills up with an abundance of some weird looking

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:46.540
liquid.

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:51.900
His next then protrudes outward and is then
replaced with the planet as Henry looks horrified.

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:56.720
Then we see this famous shot of Henry shocked
as eraser shavings party behind him!

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:00.650
Then we see the man with the levers struggle
with pulling them, then in white light, Henry

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:05.010
embraces with the Lady in The Radiator and
the movie abruptly ends!

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:07.950
So guys this is my view of what the movie
is about.

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:11.890
Obviously its surreal so its not meant to
entirely make sense.

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:14.810
But its about being a father unexpectedly.

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:19.660
Henry wasn't ready to take care of a baby,
he can barely take care of himself, I mean

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:21.720
he has a one room apartment!

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:26.650
You could also argue that Henry possibly has
schizophrenia behavior, and that the baby

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:29.070
actually was born prematurely.

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:32.640
Then at the end, he kills the baby because
of his twisted mind!

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:37.000
I'm interesting and hearing what you guys
think, but lets get to the most disturbed

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:44.000
moment and most enjoyed moment in the spooky
stuff!

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.560
So right into it, the most disturbed moment
for me was probably the death of the baby.

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:52.900
Its hard to pick in a movie like this, but
the baby seemed pretty real and it was kinda

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:56.000
eye opening to see the baby pass the way it
did!

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.720
The most enjoyed moment was when The Lady
In The Radiator singed this beautiful song!

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:04.960
You can find it on YouTube somewhere but It
really got stuck in my head.

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:09.440
