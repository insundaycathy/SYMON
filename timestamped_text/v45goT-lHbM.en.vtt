00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.301
Detective Recapped here. Today, I'm going
to explain a Drama film called: "The Only

00:00:04.301 --> 00:00:08.930
Living Boy in New York." Spoilers ahead! Watch
out and take care.

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:13.380
For Thomas Webb, his friend Mimi is the only
thing in his life that he's settled on. Thomas

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.570
is crazy for her, but unfortunately, she doesn't
feel the same towards him. She only likes

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.880
him as a friend, so when Mimi told him that
she's going to Croatia, Thomas feels betrayed.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.410
He confesses his feelings for her, but this
only ends in disappointment when Thomas learns

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.539
that they're not on the same page.

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.429
After having a little argument with Mimi,
Thomas goes home. Along the way, he meets

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:36.140
his new neighbor, W.F. Gerald. Gerald introduces
himself to Thomas, and when he asks the young

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.860
man what's troubling him, Thomas tells him
he's having a bad day. Being a perceptive

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.730
person, Gerald asks for the name of the girl
he's having trouble with. Gerald continues

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.340
to ask questions about her, making Thomas
feel uneasy. He then asks Gerald if he's a

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.940
psychiatrist, and while Gerald says he isn't,
he believes that he could be of some help.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.180
Reluctant to keep answering, Thomas tells
Gerald it was nice meeting him before going

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.609
to his apartment. After a while, Thomas decides
to just talk to Gerald and share his feelings

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.280
about his friend.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.930
Thomas says that they get each other, but
Mimi has a boyfriend already. He spent a night

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.860
with Mimi once, but everything suddenly went
platonic, leaving Thomas confused. In response,

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.640
Gerald advises him to make Mimi afraid of
not being with him by letting life take over.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.850
He says that Thomas has to find the right
time before making his move, which Thomas

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.040
finds a bit funny. Gerald wisely tells Thomas
that everyone's life is just as random as

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.200
it is deliberate and funny as it is tragic.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.790
For Thomas' unstable mother, Judith, throwing
dinner parties is her way of self-medicating.

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.130
She likes taking in artists who come to New
York from different places, since they distract

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.831
her from her problems and drunken outbursts.
As Thomas joins his mother's dinner party

00:01:34.831 --> 00:01:39.540
one night, his father, Ethan, talks about
being a writer. Being a publisher, he observes

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.920
that nobody reads fiction anymore, and that's
why most novelists these days don't have enough

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.170
money to support themselves. Ethan then tells
them that if ever Thomas wants to be a writer,

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.800
he'd talk him out of it. Ethan isn't sure
why his son refuses to go to college since

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.550
Thomas is just living on the Lower East Side
without any direction. Still unsure about

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.840
his life, Thomas only looks at Ethan, sad
that his father doesn't understand him.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.040
One night, Thomas and Mimi go to a jazz bar.
As they talk about his new neighbor, Thomas

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.830
notices his father arrive with a young woman.
As they take their seat, Ethan gets intimate

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.750
with the woman and kisses her. Thomas and
Mimi later go back to Thomas' place, and they

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.500
two talk about what they've just seen. Thomas
wonders what will happen if his mother finds

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.270
out about it, but Mimi assures him that it
doesn't mean his father loves him any less.

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.940
But Mimi quickly realizes that that wasn't
a good thing to say, so she apologizes for

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.060
her comment. Annoyed, Thomas pours himself
a drink, saying he knows his father doesn't

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.210
care about him, but this time, this is about
his mother. Mimi tries to comfort him, but

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.650
Thomas still feels bad. As they stare at each
other, Thomas tenderly kisses her, but Mimi

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.400
asks him not to do that. Thomas tells her
that he knows she wants it, too, but Mimi

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.560
replies that he's just confused. Thomas then
retorts about how angry he is and how he can

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.630
never get a woman as beautiful as the one
with his dad, who's good-looking and has his

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.450
own publishing house. Irritated, Mimi asks
if he's going to use Ethan's affair as a confirmation

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.640
of his own inadequacies, to which Thomas quips
that he has her for that.

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.180
The next day, Thomas asks his father out to
lunch, surprising him. During lunch, he tells

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.090
Thomas to leave his place in the Lower East
Side and live closer to them. Ethan feels

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.100
like he intentionally moved away from them,
and he finds it hurtful. Thomas doesn't reply

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.800
to his request and instead asks about his
mother, and when Ethan says she's better,

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.790
Thomas reminds him that his mother's condition
is delicate and can change anytime. Ignoring

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.590
him, Ethan offers to pay for his rent, and
again, Thomas doesn't answer. Before they

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.700
part ways, Ethan informs his son that he's
set an appointment for him with a career counselor.

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.830
As Ethan is about to get in a cab, Thomas
tries telling him that he knows about his

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.740
affair but decides against it.

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:31.000
When Ethan goes back home, he visits Gerald
and tells him about his father's affair. Gerald

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.320
asks him if he will confront his father about
it, but Thomas says he won't because his father

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.360
doesn't like him much. He adds that his mother
is a depressive bipolar who quickly unravels

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.450
when someone or something threatens their
family. Telling her about his father's affair

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.150
will destroy her, but instead of commenting
on what Thomas is saying, Gerald tells him

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.850
to furnish his place and that he lives in
Brooklyn. Thomas is surprised that Gerald

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:53.190
has two apartments, and Gerald casually says
he's rich. As Thomas continues to talk about

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.560
his father, Gerald asks him what he wants
in life. After considering Gerald's question,

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.820
Thomas says he wants to be better than his
parents.

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.340
When Ethan had his family, he ignored Thomas'
love for writing. Ethan was afraid that his

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.630
son would live a life of rejections, so Thomas
kept his writing to himself. As Thomas grew

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:11.760
older, the bond between him and his mother
intensified, making Ethan feel like an outsider.

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.101
However, things had changed when he met Johanna.
One day, Thomas decided to check if his father

00:04:16.101 --> 00:04:20.230
will meet his mistress again, so he and Mimi
wait for him outside his office building.

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:24.100
As they do, Johanna comes out of the door,
surprising them. Without thinking, Thomas

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.680
follows Johanna, making sure to keep his distance.
He follows her on a train then to a restaurant,

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.910
and Thomas can't deny that she really is beautiful.
After finding out where she lives, Thomas

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:36.801
finally goes home. When Gerald learns about
what Tomas did, he asks the young man what

00:04:36.801 --> 00:04:40.880
exactly he wants to accomplish. Thomas quickly
says he wants to tell Johanna to stop meeting

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.990
his father, so Gerald urges him just to do
it. Unfortunately, Thomas hasn't built up

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:49.070
the courage yet, so he settles with stalking
her in the meantime. However, Gerald believes

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:52.950
Thomas wants something else aside from protecting
his mother. To him, Thomas wants something

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:54.740
more provocative.

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.240
Thomas decides to follow Johanna again, and
he is surprised to find out that Johanna knows

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.750
him. Johanna recognizes him from his picture
on Ethan's desk, and when she invites him

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:06.060
to grab something to eat, Thomas accepts.
As they sit in a cafe, Thomas learns that

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:09.500
she's a freelance editor, who sometimes works
with his father, and that she's been seeing

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:13.660
Ethan for more than a year already. Fearing
for his mother's mental health, Thomas demands

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:17.100
to know why she's seeing a married man and
asks if she loves his father, but Johanna

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:20.680
evades the question. Thomas wants to know
if she thinks she can steal his father from

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.200
his mother, and Johanna simply says that Judith
may already be giving Ethan to her without

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:28.500
realizing it. As Ethan gets confused, Johanna
states that Thomas is craving something without

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.389
realizing it, and that is to sleep with her.

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:35.380
At Judith and Ethan's house, Thomas' mother
overreacts over a missing photograph. Upset,

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:38.639
she decides to smoke even though she's not
supposed to, then reminds Thomas that she'll

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:42.530
be lost without him. When Thomas confronts
Johanna for the second time, he straight-up

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:46.620
tells her to stop seeing his father. He believes
that Johanna can have any man in the city,

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:50.100
but when Johanna asks if she can have him,
Thomas doesn't answer and uses his mother's

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:54.630
fragile state as an excuse instead. Johanna
subtly teases Thomas, making him feel as if

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:56.800
he's flirting with her, before leaving.

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.720
When Ethan once mentioned to Johanna that
he's leaving Judith, she thought he wasn't

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:04.420
serious. However, the idea has stayed in her
head, suddenly making her needy. Now, Johanna

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:08.300
thinks that Thomas' attention is the remedy
to her rattled confidence. Meanwhile, Thomas

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:11.910
recounts to Gerald his confrontation with
Johanna. Gerald feels like it's pointless

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:15.240
for Thomas to be in contact with Johanna,
implying that he simply likes dealing with

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:19.090
her. Thomas doesn't want to admit it, but
after Gerald keeps pressing him, he finally

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:20.850
confesses that he wants to sleep with her.

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:25.520
At a wedding reception, Thomas and Mimi bump
into Johanna, who's with another man. Thomas

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:29.120
can't help but stare at her, and when Johanna
approaches him, she tells him that she's not

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:33.630
dating the man she's with. As they talk, Thomas
insults Johanna, saying her date probably

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:37.930
paid for her whole evening. Offended, Johanna
walks out, but Thomas quickly follows her

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:41.940
to apologize. Still pissed, Johanna pulls
Thomas aside and tells him her date is gay.

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:45.790
She then claims that he doesn't know how the
world truly works, but Thomas begs to differ.

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:49.170
To prove that he isn't an innocent child,
he gives a vivid run-down of how she probably

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:53.919
seduced his father. As Johanna is about to
say something, Thomas suddenly kisses her.

00:06:53.919 --> 00:06:57.550
Instead of getting mad, Johanna kisses him
back, and they start making out. Thomas then

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:02.060
goes back to the party, acting like nothing
happened before telling Mimi they should leave.

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:05.690
Thomas continues to see Johanna and sleeps
with her, while Mimi starts noticing Thomas'

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:09.440
absence. As Thomas gets more comfortable being
with Johanna, he confesses that he wanted

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:13.390
to write. He used to write all sorts of letters
when he was a child, and when he came up with

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:16.979
a collection of essays, he showed it to his
father, who found it to be nothing special,

00:07:16.979 --> 00:07:21.110
just serviceable. Johanna feels terrible for
him, and when she says she wants to read his

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:24.940
letters, Thomas responds that he threw them
away. Later on, Thomas shows one of his works

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:28.580
to Gerald, and he thinks Thomas has talent.
He then tells him he thinks about Johanna

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:32.861
all the time, and that maybe it's love, but
Gerald says love is hard to determine. When

00:07:32.861 --> 00:07:36.900
asked if he's ever been in love, Gerald explains
that he fell in love with his friend's girl.

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:41.550
They had a connection, but it was a mess,
so he left. Gerald then borrows Thomas' essays,

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:45.030
and before he goes, Thomas proudly tells him
that as of the moment, he doesn't feel guilty

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:46.030
about Johanna.

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:50.970
One time, while Gerald is away, Thomas goes
to his apartment to retrieve his essays. After

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:54.861
seeing no signs of Gerald, he finds a manuscript
written by a Julian Stellars called "The Only

00:07:54.861 --> 00:07:59.509
Living Boy in New York." Despite his curiosity,
Thomas doesn't read it and leaves. When he

00:07:59.509 --> 00:08:03.090
finds Gerald, Thomas confronts him about his
secret identity, claiming that he's a famous

00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:07.270
author who has published 12 books. Thomas
then tells Gerald that he knows he's an alcoholic

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:11.370
who spends most afternoons drinking in the
Brooklyn Inn. As Thomas sits beside Gerald,

00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:14.610
he feels happy after realizing that it was
a professional opinion when Gerald said he

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:18.530
had talent. However, he also feels like he
doesn't know anything about the world, but

00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:22.670
Gerald disagrees, reminding Thomas that he's
slept with his father's mistress. When Thomas

00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:26.860
asks Gerald if he's the only living boy in
New York, Gerald tells him that he is.

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:30.669
Thomas goes to Johanna's house one evening
to give her his essays, but she isn't there.

00:08:30.669 --> 00:08:34.439
As he is about to go home, he calls Johanna
to tell her he dropped by her place, but he

00:08:34.439 --> 00:08:38.139
is surprised to see her walking with his father.
Curious, Thomas follows them as they enter

00:08:38.139 --> 00:08:42.319
a restaurant, and upon seeing the two being
sweet to each other, Thomas leaves. When he

00:08:42.319 --> 00:08:46.119
meets Mimi later that night, Mimi asks him
if he's slept with Johanna, but Thomas denies

00:08:46.119 --> 00:08:47.119
it.

00:08:47.119 --> 00:08:50.929
After making love with Johanna, Thomas insists
she stop seeing Ethan, but Johanna doesn't

00:08:50.929 --> 00:08:54.620
care about what he wants. Upset that Johanna
won't listen to him, Thomas asks about her

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:58.810
childhood instead. When he asks what her father
does, Johanna reveals that her father took

00:08:58.810 --> 00:09:03.170
his life. Feeling sorry for her, Thomas changes
the subject and asks why she sleeps with him

00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:06.670
and what she likes about him. Johanna says
she likes him and his innocence, but when

00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:10.950
Thomas asks if she was ever innocent, Johanna
says she forgot. Annoyed, Johanna questions

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:14.130
why he's with someone not as pure as her,
and Thomas simply tells her he cares about

00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:18.620
her. As they stare into each others' eyes,
Johanna says she doesn't care about anyone.

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:22.920
However, she knows that that's a lie, as she
cares about Ethan and Thomas.

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:26.399
Thomas meets Gerald later on and asks him
why he's writing about him. While smoking

00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:29.879
his tobacco, Gerald says he left his house
and got the apartment to write about something

00:09:29.879 --> 00:09:33.689
new but failed. When he met Thomas, he found
his story interesting and started writing

00:09:33.689 --> 00:09:37.830
about him. Letting the subject go, Thomas
invites Gerald to his father's party for his

00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:41.110
publishing house's anniversary, but Gerald
declines.

00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:44.410
As Thomas and Mimi go to the party together,
she tells Thomas that she broke up with her

00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:49.319
boyfriend. Thomas seems uninterested in the
news, disappointing Mimi. At the party, Thomas

00:09:49.319 --> 00:09:53.509
sees Gerald by the bar and approaches him.
Thomas points to Judith and Mimi, and Gerald

00:09:53.509 --> 00:09:57.000
says his mother is beautiful. Thomas then
goes to his mother and tells her there's someone

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.869
he wants her to meet. But when they go to
the bar, Gerald is already gone. On the rooftop,

00:10:01.869 --> 00:10:06.360
Gerald approaches Johanna and says he knows
her very well. Seeing that Johanna is confused,

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:09.700
Gerald subtly warns her not to break Thomas'
heart, making her feel uncomfortable. Johanna

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:14.009
then leaves, and as she goes back to the party,
she just walks past Thomas.

00:10:14.009 --> 00:10:17.860
Worried, Thomas quickly follows her, and once
he catches up to Johanna, she tells him they

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:21.660
should stop seeing each other. She breaks
the news that Ethan proposed to her, and she

00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:25.459
accepted. Angry, Thomas tells her that his
father is just going through a crisis and

00:10:25.459 --> 00:10:29.189
that he will never let him leave his mother.
Johanna tries reasoning with him, saying she's

00:10:29.189 --> 00:10:33.639
just saving Judith from the weight of a dead
marriage, but Thomas won't hear her out. Upset,

00:10:33.639 --> 00:10:36.540
Thomas says he'll tell his father about them
and walks away with Johanna trying to stop

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:40.759
him. However, Thomas suddenly changes his
mind and leaves the party.

00:10:40.759 --> 00:10:44.670
Mimi follows Thomas as he goes home. Under
the rain, she confesses that she broke up

00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:48.621
with her boyfriend because she got into Croatia,
and she wants Thomas to come with her. Instead

00:10:48.621 --> 00:10:52.319
of accepting Mimi's invitation, Thomas confesses
that he slept with Johanna and he thought

00:10:52.319 --> 00:10:56.059
he was in love with her, but Mimi doesn't
believe him. When Thomas insists he's telling

00:10:56.059 --> 00:11:00.939
the truth, Mimi walks away, and even with
Thomas' apologies, Mimi doesn't care anymore.

00:11:00.939 --> 00:11:04.769
Mimi leaves in a car, and when Thomas finally
gets to his parents' house, he lies down in

00:11:04.769 --> 00:11:07.160
bed and immediately falls asleep.

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:11.130
The following morning, Judith is surprised
to see that Thomas has spent the night there.

00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:14.360
She wonders if Thomas has a problem, and he
tells his mother that things got messy and

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:18.180
he wants to bail. Concerned, Judith tells
him that the only way out is through, and

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:22.629
Thomas agrees with her. He then goes to his
father's office, where he bumps into Johanna.

00:11:22.629 --> 00:11:26.339
The two race to Ethan's office, and when Thomas
gets there first, he immediately tries to

00:11:26.339 --> 00:11:30.759
confess about Johanna. When Johanna arrives,
she tries to stop Thomas from talking, and

00:11:30.759 --> 00:11:33.989
in the middle of it all, Ethan gets confused
to learn that his son and mistress know each

00:11:33.989 --> 00:11:37.309
other. Determined to get everything out of
his chest, Thomas admits that he slept with

00:11:37.309 --> 00:11:41.920
Johanna more than once. This mortifies Johanna,
and she turns around as she cries, while Ethan

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:46.680
starts getting emotional, too. Suddenly, Ethan
attacks Thomas, asserting that he has no idea

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:50.850
how much he's done for him. Ethan cries as
he touches Johanna, and when it gets too overwhelming

00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:55.290
for him, he leaves. Alone with Thomas in Ethan's
office, Johanna tells him she really loves

00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:59.529
his father. Before going, Johanna shows Thomas
a newspaper clipping of him while playing

00:11:59.529 --> 00:12:01.809
tennis, with Gerald in the crowd.

00:12:01.809 --> 00:12:05.730
Thomas goes to Gerald's apartment to confront
the man, but Gerald isn't there. When he sees

00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:09.439
the ashtray from Brooklyn Inn, Thomas immediately
heads there and finds Gerald drinking in the

00:12:09.439 --> 00:12:14.060
bar. When Thomas shows him the newspaper clipping,
Gerald admits that he's Thomas' biological

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:17.660
father. When Ethan and Judith found out that
Ethan's infertile, they asked for Gerald's

00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:21.360
help, and he happily obliged. Gerald admits
to falling in love with Judith, but after

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:25.050
she gave birth to Thomas, Gerald decided not
to complicate things and just watch his son

00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:28.981
from afar. Gerald says he was desperate to
connect with him and nurture his talent, but

00:12:28.981 --> 00:12:33.240
he never did. After that, Gerald turned his
story into his next book, and as Thomas listens

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:36.389
to his father, he hugs Gerald until he cries.

00:12:36.389 --> 00:12:40.209
Thomas returns to his parents' house and learns
that his mother already knows about everything.

00:12:40.209 --> 00:12:43.339
He then starts talking about Gerald, saying
he knows she's been in love with him for the

00:12:43.339 --> 00:12:47.920
last 25 years. Judith is confused as to how
Thomas knew about it, and Thomas says Gerald

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:52.149
told him about their story himself. Guilty,
Judith tells Thomas it was her idea not to

00:12:52.149 --> 00:12:56.250
say anything about his birth father, and Thomas
understands. With their secrets finally out

00:12:56.250 --> 00:13:00.529
in the open, Judith asks about Gerald's welfare,
and Thomas happily answers her.

00:13:00.529 --> 00:13:04.170
After some time, Thomas is at the library
he works in, and there, he reads his letter

00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:08.319
of rejection from a publishing company. Ethan
suddenly shows up, and after he gets a copy

00:13:08.319 --> 00:13:12.569
of Gerald's book, Thomas expresses his admiration
for him for not running away. They then do

00:13:12.569 --> 00:13:15.899
some catching up in the park, where Thomas
tells Ethan that Mimi has finally moved to

00:13:15.899 --> 00:13:20.959
Croatia. When Thomas asks if he still speaks
with Johanna, Ethan says he doesn't anymore.

00:13:20.959 --> 00:13:24.559
He then asks about Judith, and Thomas is delighted
to tell him that she's finally quit smoking

00:13:24.559 --> 00:13:28.449
and started writing for ARTnews again. Thomas
also adds that Judith has a date later in

00:13:28.449 --> 00:13:32.470
the evening, and Ethan says that's good for
her. After they part ways, Thomas goes to

00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:44.470
Gerald's book-reading event, where he sees
his mother happily listening to the man she

00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:44.959
loves.
