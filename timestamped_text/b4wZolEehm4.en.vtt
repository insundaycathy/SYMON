00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.640
imagine entering an ancient old pyramid somewhere&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.760
in Egypt only to be killed by&nbsp;
the death god anubis himself

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.520
while death is generally undesirable being&nbsp;
killed by a god is a pretty cool thing we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:20.480
can't ignore the fact so in this video i will&nbsp;
reveal the immense stupidity and complete absence&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.880
of brain in our character's approach from the&nbsp;
comfortable seat of my ergonomic gaming chair&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.800
with an extremely humble sense of&nbsp;
undeniable and king-like superiority&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.200
in this video we will beat&nbsp;
the pyramid in pyramid yeah

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.840
now before we begin you should pick a character&nbsp;
who you identify most with so we all know at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.480
which point you would likely die if this&nbsp;
happened to you yes in case you wonder this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.840
is an educational video these are the characters&nbsp;
this is the blonde chick right here she's the main&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:59.200
character if you are forward thinking annoying&nbsp;
and generally confident well then that's you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:04.320
congratulations this is her father or&nbsp;
your father well whatever if you stick&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.400
with what you know generally think you are&nbsp;
better and think the other people are stupid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.320
then that's you her boyfriend is this guy&nbsp;
right here if you're good looking as simp and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:20.000
emotionally unstable welcome to the club they&nbsp;
are followed by a reporter and her cameraman&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.640
if you are disliked by most around you without&nbsp;
realizing it's actually your fault because you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.680
think you're perfect then that's you cameraman&nbsp;
is this guy right here if you lack confidence&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.400
are pushed around consistently by everybody&nbsp;
around but accept that reality without a problem&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.840
hi how you doing so our team of archaeologists&nbsp;
are excavating the finding of the century a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:46.080
three-sided pyramid 250 miles of cairo oh and&nbsp;
by the way this is rashid he's the security guy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.800
responsible for the excavation side safety but&nbsp;
before they can enter they are told to leave&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:56.080
within 24 hours and return to the united states&nbsp;
apparently there is a civil war breaking out in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:01.520
the capital but of course they don't care because&nbsp;
they are archaeologists you must be passionate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.480
about what you do therefore you don't just leave&nbsp;
this important site behind if you aren't willing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:11.040
to take risks you would have done better sticking&nbsp;
with collecting fossils and pokemon or shells on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:22.640
a beach so when they find the entrance of the&nbsp;
pyramid this is what happened now i don't know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.680
about y'all but that looked like voldemort coming&nbsp;
out for some fresh air they however deemed it as a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:34.400
poisonous gas released by a fungus now you know&nbsp;
honestly i don't really care what it was right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:41.040
it's obviously unhealthy to be near that thing&nbsp;
so back up and leave it's simple but what they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:48.160
do next is the following they own wall E yes the&nbsp;
Pixar thing a small tech gadget worth hundreds of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.120
thousands of USD it's a perfect gadget for&nbsp;
this exploration mission so when they move&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.000
it in it doesn't take long until it gets ripped&nbsp;
apart causing our characters to lose all context

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.280
well what could have done something like this well&nbsp;
let's analyze and then move on to the how to beat&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:13.040
this pyramid was excavated during the past few&nbsp;
weeks of your presence it was covered by several&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:19.040
meters of sand the only entrance was the one&nbsp;
you forcefully broke through a few hours ago so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:24.080
whatever it is that's inside this pyramid and&nbsp;
broke your gadget it can't be anything normal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:29.120
unless you consider that there is another way in&nbsp;
meaning if this happened to you you must consider&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:34.640
the following perhaps there is another entrance&nbsp;
or you let a stray animal enter this highly sacred&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.120
and important cultural heritage in which case&nbsp;
you suck at what you do and you should pack&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.560
and leave anyways or you sealed the entrance&nbsp;
after opening it which you should have done&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:49.920
in which case nothing could have entered without&nbsp;
being noticed so what do you do exactly you enter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.800
this age-old extremely unstable pyramid without&nbsp;
the supervision of anyone but your own amateurish&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:00.160
team but you're not stupid you would never enter&nbsp;
without appropriate safety measures right that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:05.280
why i utilize this tiny [ __ ] piece of wire&nbsp;
right here genius now it goes without saying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:10.880
that one wire attached to one fixture outside is&nbsp;
extremely risky it would have been easy to fixate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:16.800
a couple additional wires just in case i mean&nbsp;
why not right also instead of five people going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:22.240
in to retrieve a destroyed robo thing it doesn't&nbsp;
seem all that smart to me leave someone behind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.880
seriously if you don't make it out for whatever&nbsp;
reason you have back up outside and you will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.920
be safe no matter what to beat the threat of&nbsp;
getting lost inside this pyramid you should do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:37.440
the following when you enter this pyramid leave&nbsp;
a trace back you can't rely on the wires only&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.320
they are a great idea but leaving physical totems&nbsp;
back as you walk deeper into the pyramid would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:47.680
have been a much safer option additionally set&nbsp;
up roles before you enter that's my beat number&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:53.920
three who leads who's to rear and what do you do&nbsp;
in the case of a cave in i'm a big fan of roles&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:53.920 --> 00:05:00.080
okay if you watched my past videos i'm all about&nbsp;
distributing roles with roles everybody can focus&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:05.200
on what they do best without having to concentrate&nbsp;
on multiple things at once this adds a layer of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:10.960
clarity security and alertness while minimizing&nbsp;
confusion and the feeling of being lost which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:16.720
happens fairly easy in an unknown environment&nbsp;
in my opinion even having systems in place to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:22.880
ensure that you don't get lost aka the wires and&nbsp;
breadcrumbs behind two people of the team should&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:28.720
solely focus on where exactly you're going in&nbsp;
fact writing down arrows on a blank piece of paper&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:34.080
indicating when you make a turn is the simplest&nbsp;
and most secure way to ensure your orientation

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:42.880
so they finally find what they came for a&nbsp;
completely wrecked wall-E of course but that stuff&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:48.080
happens when you are an adventurer for 100k worth&nbsp;
piece of tech it seems more like something you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:53.200
would buy an alibaba let's be honest looking at&nbsp;
the wrecked piece of tech it doesn't look like a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:58.720
dog trashed it of course not we knew that to begin&nbsp;
with but if you really needed to come back and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:04.000
check for yourself this completely gadget should&nbsp;
be a red flag i mean it looks like a victim of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.880
a freaking crocodile attack let's be honest here&nbsp;
people entering this pyramid without the support&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:15.120
of either indiana jones lara croft or nathan&nbsp;
drake is just painful to watch your wire what oh&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:23.040
that's a snap in the following scenes the pathetic&nbsp;
little wires snapped not that we expected that huh&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:27.200
we lost completely our orientation and&nbsp;
the reporter has nothing better to do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:32.160
than blaming the cameraman if i were in that team&nbsp;
she would have been the first one to be exiled&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:37.040
now the curious thing here is they argue which&nbsp;
way to go eventually settle with the blonde&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:43.120
chick's opinion take her route and almost die of&nbsp;
course the better option would have been to find&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:48.080
the other part of the wire which must be somewhere&nbsp;
so instead of walking endlessly trying to find the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:52.960
entrance aka the exit just try to find the&nbsp;
other part of the dwyer and you'll be safe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:57.120
but that would be too easy so eventually&nbsp;
our precious characters end up

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:06.640
here next to finding wall e's remaining&nbsp;
body the chamber is about to cave in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:11.440
and i was wondering when that would finally&nbsp;
happen this bird view gives us a perfect angle&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:17.040
to look at what's going on here so we got three&nbsp;
people on this side with the exit behind them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:21.200
and then we got two people on the other&nbsp;
side the simp and the victimized cameraman&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:25.280
now it doesn't really matter on which side you&nbsp;
stand but i suggest you never take the lead in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:30.160
unknown territory that way you would never end&nbsp;
up where those two on the left have ended up here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:36.160
if the surface is about to cave in what do you do&nbsp;
exactly you get away from the center to distribute&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:41.280
the weight more evenly the next thing you&nbsp;
should do would be to leave that area one by one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:48.880
whoever is closer to the exit should go first&nbsp;
one plus one is two not three not one and a half&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:55.360
not four not seventeen it's two our characters&nbsp;
do the opposite they tell those on the left&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:59.920
to walk exactly through the center pass the&nbsp;
three characters on the right to make it to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:05.360
the safe zone that's more than stupid because it&nbsp;
doesn't follow any sort of conceivable rationale&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:09.600
if you follow what i've mentioned just before&nbsp;
you should be on the safer side no question&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:16.080
and if you are a special kind of intelligent&nbsp;
person then this is for you then you probably have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:28.000
noticed this giant massive protrusion around the&nbsp;
walls duh so our character fell through and his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.800
luck or bad luck would have it everyone survived&nbsp;
including you of course but it doesn't take long&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:38.400
and a massive boulder crushes the sims leg and&nbsp;
takes him out if this was you sorry to break it to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:44.080
you but it's over claim your reward in the comment&nbsp;
section what it goes without saying that if you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:49.200
are lost and are unable to proceed independently&nbsp;
you have almost zero chance to survive if your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:54.320
team doesn't consist of at least two above average&nbsp;
strong people leaving you back is the single best&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:59.680
option concerning the group that's another reason&nbsp;
why sticking with people is generally great but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:05.200
hold your distance if they seem to be stupid quick&nbsp;
side note when the four characters proceed and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:10.880
open up the entrance to the part next by they take&nbsp;
away those big wooden bars obstructing the passage&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:16.400
with those spars it would have been probably easy&nbsp;
to leverage that boulder off of simp man's leg&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:20.160
he could have been safe this is what i'm&nbsp;
talking about but for that you would have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:26.240
needed to carry him over and that would have been&nbsp;
probably a little bit uh annoying or so i guess&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:30.000
but come to think of it it would have been&nbsp;
probably a good idea to carry him over&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:36.960
so if you were attacked by a monster at some point&nbsp;
you could just throw him away as a decoy and just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:43.200
go for a run so survival of the fittest&nbsp;
right when they finally proceed this happens

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:53.840
two things savage mommy cats are no joke and&nbsp;
Arab people with ak-47s are a blessing in certain&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:59.520
situations unfortunately that doesn't last too&nbsp;
long rashid or whatever his name was gets pulled&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:04.640
into the tunnel and is now gone too perfect there&nbsp;
was a way to beat that event though first of all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:09.120
rasheed had a handgun on his side while he was&nbsp;
firing his assault rifle somebody should have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:14.320
grabbed that handgun he ran out of ammo quickly&nbsp;
too but looking at his outfit he probably had&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:19.680
backup ammunition too if we can avoid his death&nbsp;
here not only could we pick up a valuable new team&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:26.480
member but we could also grab a firearm as well&nbsp;
but he died okay no wishful thinking here we also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:32.480
don't have any idea on how rashid got in here that&nbsp;
question should have been priority to answer now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:37.520
it's too late he dropped his assault rifle though&nbsp;
and our characters proceeded without picking that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:42.560
weapon up which i think is a dumb move even&nbsp;
a rifle with no loaded shots is preferable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:47.920
compared to bare hands especially when you will&nbsp;
have to fight sneaky little monster cats do you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:53.280
remember when i was talking about never walking at&nbsp;
the front in unknown territory well please enjoy

00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:02.320
well well well watching how to beat videos&nbsp;
is what they didn't do that much i can tell&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:07.600
a couple of things here for starters if you are&nbsp;
her you are doomed i think there is no need to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:13.040
explain that how to prevent that though don't run&nbsp;
mindlessly ahead if you don't know what's up front&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:17.680
remember your mother told you many times not&nbsp;
to run around the pool area how many times did&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:23.840
you have to slip and hit your head until you got&nbsp;
the point exactly but in this case you slip once&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:28.800
and then you don't slip anymore secondly i&nbsp;
can't believe they suddenly have a rope that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:34.240
can carry multiple people at once plus&nbsp;
what about those emergency lights jesus&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:39.360
but the worst thing here is that when they leave&nbsp;
they literally leave that road behind as well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:45.680
first a gun now the rope let's recap and reassess&nbsp;
the situation first in fact that's something our&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:50.880
characters should do as well the psychological&nbsp;
advantages of calling out your circumstances&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:55.840
should not be underestimated it helps a lot in&nbsp;
building a healthy framework which is pivotal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:55.840 --> 00:12:02.160
for making it out alive by now three people have&nbsp;
died three are left and we are still completely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:08.160
lost one of the things that bothers me most is why&nbsp;
none of these characters talk about how they need&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:13.040
to get on a higher level again in order to make&nbsp;
it out if you remember at the beginning of this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:18.640
movie we briefly saw the apex of the pyramid&nbsp;
she didn't look particularly wide or big but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:24.000
considering how far and deep the characters&nbsp;
went in it must have been a steady way down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:29.120
it is true that they broke through about 5 meters&nbsp;
deep as well but when we compare that extremely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:34.480
lengthy tunnel system to the actual size of the&nbsp;
pyramid's tip most corridors our characters have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:40.960
taken must include changings in elevation in that&nbsp;
case one should pay more attention to that detail&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:46.400
and look out specifically for ways that feel like&nbsp;
going upwards another idea would be to touch the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:52.400
walls floors and ceilings as much as you can no&nbsp;
i'm not talking about a stone fetish here but if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:59.280
you have one that's completely fine we at binge we&nbsp;
don't judge pyramids aren't airtight meaning there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:05.120
must be channels of constant airflow if you can&nbsp;
find one you have increased your odds quite a bit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:10.480
but while touching the walls constantly seems to&nbsp;
be a little tiring and potentially demotivating&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:15.760
i would light up one of my emergency torches&nbsp;
and see how the smoke behaves the smoke should&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:22.080
perfectly indicate where you will find an exit&nbsp;
or of course you find another part of wall-e&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:27.840
yes that third time jesus you use it still&nbsp;
functioning antenna wire it magically to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:32.880
your camera system and send out a message i&nbsp;
mean sure you could do that but that would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:38.000
be for the elon musks out there for my part i&nbsp;
already struggle with placing those batteries&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:45.040
into my remote [ __ ] anyway our three remaining&nbsp;
characters proceed getting more lost than ever&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:50.160
before however that's possible eventually they&nbsp;
find a secret door and manage to open it up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:54.480
at this point i'm really not sure anymore&nbsp;
if my whole script here is complete nonsense&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:59.120
and those three characters don't even try to&nbsp;
find the exit the chamber they find is the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:04.960
Pharaoh chamber and it doesn't take too long until&nbsp;
it's only two of them left we have to keep going

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:14.480
now it's not explicitly mentioned that what killed&nbsp;
him was anubis himself but according to the style&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:20.240
in which he was killed his heart was ripped out&nbsp;
we can assume that it was in fact anubis a later&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:25.920
scene further backs this claim up here we see&nbsp;
how he weighs the heart of his victim apparently&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:31.680
anubis would weigh the hearts of deceased people&nbsp;
against an ostrich feather if the heart turned out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:37.360
to be heavier the soul would be sent to hell while&nbsp;
heaven would await those whose hearts are lighter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:44.320
yeah that must have been a happy era to die in&nbsp;
huh gravity was discovered 4500 years later now we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:50.480
know why anyway how do we beat a god well that's&nbsp;
up for debate but before we get there this is what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:57.200
happens next the blonde chick and the cameraman&nbsp;
run away that's probably a smart move but escaping&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:02.000
a noob is in a dark and sticky underground&nbsp;
labyrinth housing shitty little monster cats&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:07.200
that you can't seem to escape i don't know man&nbsp;
i think a quick death is probably preferable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:12.560
with a lot of luck though both of them survive and&nbsp;
the Anubis walks out the secret chamber without&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:19.520
taking note of them now what do you do in this&nbsp;
position A. you quickly try to escape or B. you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:25.360
watch the camera footage of course you you watch&nbsp;
the camera footage because we all know we have to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:30.880
work ahead i absolutely can't believe how freaking&nbsp;
slowly those characters are they are like my&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:36.000
grandma buying groceries but unlike them she isn't&nbsp;
chased by the freaking underworld god for christ's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:41.440
sake that monster left that secret chamber already&nbsp;
what you should do is don't speak and find an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:47.280
alternative exit as fast as you can if you can't&nbsp;
hide and try to sneak out from where you came in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:53.440
once it comes back but when they finally find the&nbsp;
path after about 20 minutes mind you it's too late&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:58.160
of course it's too late what did you expect the&nbsp;
cam guy gets killed and the blonde chick gets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:03.680
captured that could have been prevented multiple&nbsp;
times about 97 times throughout the script here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:07.840
um so what are you doing this scene what do&nbsp;
you do in this position how do you beat the god&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:12.480
according to the egyptian book of the dead there&nbsp;
are multiple spells that could assist you in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:18.480
this situation if anubis is real the spells that&nbsp;
groom him are just as likely to be real as well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:25.280
so as a last resort i would recite ancient hymns&nbsp;
dedicated to anubis best case is he sets you free&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:30.720
and worst case you will end up as his new bride&nbsp;
but if you don't know any satanic poetry by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:36.560
heart no worries according to this video and&nbsp;
newbies can be easily beat with the right beat

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.960
and who knows you might end up as bffs&nbsp;
eternally dancing to underground tunes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:51.440
in the twilight of shadow and death
