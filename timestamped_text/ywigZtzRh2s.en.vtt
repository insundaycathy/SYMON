Hi guys, K- Movie Recapped here.

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:05.049
Before we start, WARNING!

00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:06.049
Spoilers Ahead!

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:11.469
Today, I’m going to recap a 2017 Korean
Action Fantasy movie, called Along with the

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:13.540
Gods: the Two Worlds.

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:18.210
This movie tells the story of a man who died,
and whose soul is claimed by Hell.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.230
He meets the Guardians who will defend him
in 7 trials of Hell, before being reincarnated.

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.950
So, how hard are the trials?

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:27.550
Will he get reincarnated?

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.859
Let’s find it out
The movie starts with the death of firefighter

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.390
Kim, after saving people trapped in a burning
building.

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:40.460
Haewonmak and Deok-choon, the two Guardians,
greet Kim and explain that he is dead.

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.090
Due to his honorable death, he gets the status
of a Paragon.

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:49.129
Kim has to go through 7 trials over 49 days,
and will be defended by the Guardians, in

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:51.170
order to be reincarnated.

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.630
Kim was forcefully portaled to Hell, to start
the trials.

00:00:54.630 --> 00:01:00.240
In Hell, Kim is greeted by Guardian Leader,
Gang-rim, who has reincarnated 47 souls in

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.420
the past century.

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.310
Kim’s first trial is Murder Trial in Volcano
of the Damned.

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:09.290
Through Deok-choon’s clairvoyance, it is
revealed that Kim left his friend to die in

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.700
a burning building during his duty, despite
having enough time to save him from death.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.120
A bottomless fiery pit opened beneath the
ground Kim’s standing on, with a lot of

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.120
souls trying to crawl up.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.490
The two prosecutors that accompany the Judge
of Murder try to charge Kim with 5 years in

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:25.840
the bottomless pit.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.710
However, Mirror of Karma, which plays records
of Kim’s life at that moment, reveals that

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.760
Kim’s friend asks him to save the victims
first before saving him.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.890
With these facts taken into consideration,
the Judge verdicts that Kim is innocent, and

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.610
the charge is rejected.

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.760
For the second trial, Kim will be tried for
how well he uses the time among the living.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.290
Before facing the Goddess of Indolence, Gang-rim
asks Kim not to talk back to the Goddess,

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:51.750
without exceptions.

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.330
To start the trial, Deok-choon describes how
Kim is diligent in using his time to save

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:01.290
both people and animals, and often has to
sacrifice himself in order to do so.

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.740
The Goddess is touched by Kim’s actions.

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.020
However, when asked for the reason, Kim replied
that he was looking for money.

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.940
The Goddess, disappointed by Kim’s answer,
condemns him to fall down the waterfall.

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.300
In the River of Indolence, Kim will have to
run on a platform while being grinded by stone

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.240
rollers, or get eaten alive by human-flesh-eating
fishes.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.480
Gang-rim defends Kim desperately by showing
that Kim works so hard to help treat his ailing

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.780
mute Mother and pay for his brother’s law
school.

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.590
Finally, the Goddess changes her verdict and
finds Kim not guilty due to his reasons.

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.550
Kim and the Guardians then arrive in the Blade
Forest.

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:41.070
Haewonmak explains that Kim can visit His
Mother’s dream before being reincarnated,

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.110
which boosts Kim’s motivation of clearing
the trials.

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.270
To get through the Blade Forest, Kim as a
Paragon gets easy access to ride a boat on

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:49.540
a slide.

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.470
On the boat, they are attacked by Hell ghouls.

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.430
After effortful fighting from Gang-rim and
Haewonmak, they succeeded in fending off the

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:57.430
ghouls.

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.510
However, time in the Afterlife is speeding
up due to Kim’s family member becoming a

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.120
Vengeful Spirit.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.910
With the time constraint, Gang-rim portaled
to the World of Living to find out that the

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.510
Vengeful Spirit is actually Soo-hong, Kim’s
brother.

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.130
Rumors have spread that Soo-hong has deserted
his military post for 3 days.

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:20.130
To Gang-rim’s surprise, Soo-hong was killed
by his Junior in a gun misfire.

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.370
Soo-hong didn’t resent his Junior for this.

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:27.080
However, Soo-hong’s senior decided to bury
him and report him as a deserter to save his

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.110
promotion.

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:32.610
Unbeknownst to them, that Soo-hong was actually
still alive and was buried for a whole day

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.530
before actually dying.

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.110
Due to this treachery, Soo-hong’s soul became
a Vengeful Spirit that seeks to destroy his

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.150
Senior’s and Junior’s life.

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:46.310
Seeing the hidden kindness in Soo-hong, Gang-rim
determines to help him reincarnate too.

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.459
Having cleared the Blade Forest, Kim and the
two Guardians arrive in the Hell of Deceit

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.849
where Kim will be judged for the lies he has
said in his life.

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:57.440
The Mirror of Karma shows that Kim writes
fake letters to the daughter of his friend

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.650
whom he cannot save, and to his Mother for
the past 15 years, to give false hope.

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.120
By the Judge's consent, root trees engulf
Kim’s body to restrain him, and to cut out

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.340
Kim’s tongue.

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:13.200
In the panic, Haewonmak calls out to Gang-rim
and Gang-rim starts his final defense on Kim

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.920
by linking his mind with Deok-choon.

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.040
Gang-rim reveals that upon reading Kim’s
fake letters, both the kid and Kim’s Mother

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.280
are having a fulfilling life.

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.370
Touched by the result, the Judge clears Kim
of his charges and allows him to pass the

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:27.400
trial.

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:32.270
Before going to the next trial, Gang-rim lied
to Kim to motivate him in clearing the trials.

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.580
He told him that both his Mother and his brother
are doing well.

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.990
But this false statement leads to an avalanche
in the glaciers of Injustice Hell.

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:43.990
If Kim was found guilty in this trial, he
would be locked away for years in an ice cage

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:45.680
along the Hell of Injustice.

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:51.120
Fortunately, due to Kim being just, as a Paragon,
they can safely pass without any trial on

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.770
a cable car.

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:56.940
Upon having chit-chat, Kim found that the
Vengeful Spirit was in fact his brother and

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.650
that the Guardians are looking to eliminate
him.

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:03.950
Suddenly, the cable car collapses, and Kim
rescues the Guardians.

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:08.750
Kim and the Guardians pass through the Heavenly
Passage that meanders to the Betrayal Hell.

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:13.060
since Kim has lived a noble life, he leaves
the Betrayal Hell without any hassle.

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:17.860
Then, It is revealed that Gang-rim’s attempt
in reincarnating Soo-hong causes the Guardians

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:19.210
to have accidents.

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:23.930
Haewonmak warned Gang-rim that if he continues
to do so, the Guardians will be found guilty

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:25.840
and sentenced to death.

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:30.290
Gang-rim hunts down Soo-hong and tries to
talk to him to let go of his grudges.

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:35.360
When Gang-rim is not on guard, Soo-hong takes
the opportunity to strike him and breaks away.

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:39.900
Soo-hong’s Junior cannot bear the guilt
and reveals the location of the body to Kim’s

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:40.900
Mother.

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:44.850
While he is doing all this, Gang-rim witnesses
everything and follows him through.

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:48.620
in fact, Junior wants to commit suicide due
to his guilt.

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:53.050
when Junior hangs himself and is about to
die, Soo-hong's hatred vanishes and pleads

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:54.890
Gang-rim to save him.

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:59.380
Even though Gang-rim is not technically allowed
to intervene in earthly affairs, he empathizes

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.440
with Soo-hong and stops Junior.

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:06.050
Gang-rim’s transgression has brought disaster
to Kim and the Guardians in the afterlife,

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:09.660
so they start falling into the vacuum sinkhole
of Violent Hell.

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:15.110
At such a critical moment, Soo-hong reconciles
with Junior via Gang-rim as the medium.

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:18.100
As a result, they finally stop falling.

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:22.650
Once more being tried, Kim is charged with
Violence for cruelly beating his malnutrition

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:23.650
Brother.

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:27.780
To add to his crime, he ran away from home
for 15 years after that.

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:31.630
The God of Violence sentenced him to fall
into the bottomless vacuum sinkhole and be

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:34.200
crushed by the levitating stones.

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:38.390
Before the final verdict, Gang-rim requests
to do a combined trial for Kim’s actions

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:40.250
are tied to the next trial.

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:44.510
A combined trial means Kim will receive double
punishment and the Guardians will be stripped

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:47.360
of their privileges, if Kim is found guilty.

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:51.720
Later, through Deok-choon’s vision, it is
revealed that Kim tried to kill all of his

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:55.970
family members because they were so poor and
had no hope of surviving.

00:06:55.970 --> 00:07:00.620
Out of his regret and guilt, he beat up his
brother and decided to live for his family.

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:04.770
He ran out from home and sent money to his
Mother regularly to support their life until

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:06.340
his last breath.

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:10.880
Gang-rim cleansed Soo-hong’s soul by bringing
him back to the place of his burial, and prepares

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:12.170
to send him to the Afterlife.

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:16.940
But Kim’s Mother comes to meet the Senior
using the map Junior gave her.

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:21.610
Seeing his Mother being treated rudely, Soo-hong
turned back to a Vengeful Spirit and wreaked

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:23.440
havoc in the facility.

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:27.830
In the afterlife, Kim and the two Guardians
are confronted by an infinite army that rises

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:29.229
from the sand.

00:07:29.229 --> 00:07:33.820
Due to the disturbance caused by Soo-hong,
sandstorm rages in both Afterlife and World

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:34.990
of Living.

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:39.240
The sandstorm opens a portal connecting the
two worlds and Haewonmak is sent to the World

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:40.460
of Living.

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:43.410
In the Afterlife, Kim is caught in a quicksand.

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:47.880
With the portal opened, Soo-hong quickly stopped
the havoc to save Kim and he turned back into

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:49.560
a peaceful soul.

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:53.751
Seeing that the havoc has passed, King of
Hell Yeomra emerges with his castle, Hell

00:07:53.751 --> 00:07:57.669
of Filial Impiety, from the sand to pass judgment
on Kim.

00:07:57.669 --> 00:08:01.729
King Yeomra Directly verdicts that Kim is
guilty of trying to kill his Mother.

00:08:01.729 --> 00:08:06.180
To defend Kim, Deok-choon claims that Kim’s
Mother was unconscious and that no one was

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:07.449
killed that night.

00:08:07.449 --> 00:08:11.330
Unbeknownst to them that his Mother was conscious
and aware of Kim’s attempt.

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:15.259
But His Mother chose to stay silent because
she knew that her death will bring comfort

00:08:15.259 --> 00:08:16.750
to her kids’ life.

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:20.380
She buried the memory in her heart and waited
for Kim to return to her.

00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:25.180
Swallowed in guilt, Kim volunteers to accept
all the punishment, and asks to see his Mother

00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:27.039
once more to apologize.

00:08:27.039 --> 00:08:31.910
King Yeomra is enraged by Kim’s request
and commands the prosecutors to read the final

00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:32.910
verdict.

00:08:32.910 --> 00:08:36.569
However, Gang-rim quickly let Soo-hong visit
his Mother’s dream.

00:08:36.569 --> 00:08:40.740
There, She forgives Kim and says that the
brothers did nothing wrong and that she loves

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:41.740
them.

00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:45.600
With Kim’s Mother’s forgiveness, King
Yeomra drops the charges against Kim and orders

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:48.129
him to be reincarnated immediately.

00:08:48.129 --> 00:08:54.490
In the World of Living, Soo-hong is also declared
as a Paragon and gets VIP access for reincarnation.

00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:58.209
Gang-rim is struck to find out that Haewonmak
didn’t visit him in the World of Living

00:08:58.209 --> 00:09:01.000
and it was actually King Yeomra himself.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.720
In the final scene, Gang-rim decides to bring
Soo-hong directly to the Hell of Filial Impiety

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:10.120
to meet King Yeomra, even though before meeting
the King they have to overcome thousands of

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:11.990
warriors in Hell.
