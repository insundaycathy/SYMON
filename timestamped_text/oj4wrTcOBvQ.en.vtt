00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.600
cries and runs toward the chamber it catches&nbsp;
the woman as she fires one bullet to its arm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.520
the bullet doesn't faze the droid&nbsp;
and after another shot to the chest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.240
it lifts the woman up by the neck daughter begs&nbsp;
mother to not hurt the woman saying that she's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.880
hurt and scared and that she needs help mother&nbsp;
agrees and they take the woman to the infirmary&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.320
in the infirmary mother tries to help the&nbsp;
woman but she refuses to trust the droid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.920
she also refuses to answer any of her other&nbsp;
questions left with no choice mother leaves the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.520
woman locked in the infirmary daughter feels angry&nbsp;
and demands the truth from mother mother explains&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.760
to her that it would have been impossible to raise&nbsp;
her if she truly knew what was happening outside&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.080
daughter is not fully convinced but&nbsp;
she doesn't let her true emotions show&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.960
instead she rummages through the woman's bag&nbsp;
and finds a book filled with many portraits&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.520
she gasps happily at the possibility that&nbsp;
there might be other people like her outside&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.160
daughter asks a woman about the people in&nbsp;
the book but she only spats back at her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.200
accusing daughter of trapping her in&nbsp;
this bunker and making her the pet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.000
feeling hurt she goes back to mother and&nbsp;
asks more questions about the outside&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.720
but mother only knows about the bunker and the&nbsp;
fact that its duty is to care for its inhabitants&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.960
they go back to the infirmary and sees the woman&nbsp;
on the floor clutching her stomach from the pain&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:12.880
the sepsis has gone too far into her body and&nbsp;
would require anesthesia and surgery to remove it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.880
the woman refuses stating that she&nbsp;
doesn't trust the droid one bit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.600
daughter wants to help the woman survive so&nbsp;
she volunteers to be the one to do the surgery&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.800
the woman finally agrees to compromise after&nbsp;
an extremely painful surgical procedure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.760
daughter successfully removes the bullet from her&nbsp;
hip the next day daughter accompanies the woman&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.640
as she recovers the woman feels more at ease now&nbsp;
and starts telling her about where she came from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:42.240
apparently she was on a food run along with a few&nbsp;
other people the other droids found them and shot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:47.440
at them leaving her to survive the woman suggests&nbsp;
that they both leave stating that daughter doesn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.880
belong there but the conversation is&nbsp;
cut short as mother enters the room&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.520
mother grows wary of their relationship and&nbsp;
takes daughter away to begin her examinations&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.640
mother tells her that the woman hasn't been&nbsp;
truthful to them according to mother the bullet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.040
from the woman's hip didn't match the bullet from&nbsp;
a droid implying the fact that the woman was shot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:10.080
by someone who was with her and perhaps for a&nbsp;
good reason to despite her conflicting emotions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:15.600
daughter takes her annual examinations and passes&nbsp;
with flying colors her highest percentage to date&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.520
as a reward mother finally allows her to&nbsp;
choose the next member of their family&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:25.360
daughter is ecstatic and picks a male embryo from&nbsp;
the group as night comes daughter confronts the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.680
woman and tells her about the bullet the woman&nbsp;
then asks her if she's confirmed this with her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.880
own eyes daughter is taken aback knowing full&nbsp;
well that it's only what mother has told her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:40.240
trying to make sense of things daughter escapes to&nbsp;
the lab she compares the two bullets and realizes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:45.280
that they're identical meaning mother lied to her&nbsp;
she soon discovers records of previous infants&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.000
it turns out that mother had raised two infants&nbsp;
before her but they were aborted because they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.880
didn't pass its requirements as she approaches&nbsp;
the incinerator daughter feels her reality&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:00.160
collapsing around her she sifts through the ashes&nbsp;
and finds the skeletal remains of her two sisters&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.040
she cries in a corner as she fully realizes the&nbsp;
extent of the horror that her mother has done&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:10.160
she goes back to the infirmary and agrees to the&nbsp;
woman's plan for escape but only if they take&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:15.040
her brother with them the next morning daughter&nbsp;
steals some stuff from the nursery to bring with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:20.000
her brother but mother catches her she pretends&nbsp;
to be preparing for her brother's arrival but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.600
her anxious behavior gives her away as she turns&nbsp;
around she sees mother leaving the nursery and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:31.760
locking her inside she runs to the door begging&nbsp;
to be let out but it's too late meanwhile mother&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:36.080
visits the woman in the infirmary and reveals&nbsp;
that it's been listening to their conversation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:40.560
as mother threatens to get rid of her the woman&nbsp;
jumps on its back and lunges the makeshift knife&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:45.760
into its chest she manages to cut one of the&nbsp;
fluid pumps in its body but mother survives&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:51.040
at the infirmary daughter sprays the glass door&nbsp;
with chemicals turning it into ice and then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:56.160
kicks it down she then activates the fire alarm&nbsp;
prompting mother to let go of the woman and tend&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:02.240
to the alarm the woman takes her bag and manages&nbsp;
to escape the room she runs to the control room&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:08.000
and begins destroying the bunker system as she&nbsp;
limps in the hallway daughter catches up to her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.680
the woman convinces her to leave without her&nbsp;
brother telling her that they will come back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:16.720
for him with more help they reach the airlock&nbsp;
but mother has now backed them into a corner&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:22.160
it tries to persuade daughter not to leave the&nbsp;
woman takes this chance and holds daughter hostage&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.360
she threatens mother to open the doors&nbsp;
or else she is going to kill daughter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:30.720
left with no choice mother opens the doors and&nbsp;
the two slip into the dusty and decaying land&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:36.640
they run through the fields successfully evading&nbsp;
capture from other droids they reach the women's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:41.520
camp a rusty shipment crate near the sea but&nbsp;
to daughter's horror the camp is only composed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:47.840
of the woman a dog and now her she lashes out at&nbsp;
the woman slapping her and blaming her for leaving&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:52.960
her brother alone the woman retorts and says it's&nbsp;
the only way to convince daughter to come with her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:58.880
she pushes the woman away and goes outside as&nbsp;
daughter looks out at the ocean she contemplates&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:03.760
reality in her life she will not accept defeat&nbsp;
and she will not accept the fact that she's left&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:09.440
her brother to suffer the same fate as she did she&nbsp;
brings herself together and forms a plan the woman&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:15.360
comes out from the crate but finds daughter gone&nbsp;
and in her place an origami daughter runs back all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:20.400
the way to the bunker and makes it unscathed as&nbsp;
she reaches the doors of her previous home tons&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:25.440
of droids stop her in her tracks with their red&nbsp;
lasers she demands to talk to mother in the droids&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:30.160
let her pass through terrified yet determined&nbsp;
daughter grabs an axe and makes her way to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:35.680
droid she's known all her life in the nursery she&nbsp;
finds mother cradling her newborn baby brother&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:40.960
this time she learns the whole truth how mother&nbsp;
had watched the previous humans succumb to their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:46.240
self-destructive nature how it planned and wiped&nbsp;
out humanity and how now it plans to rebuild&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:51.840
mankind to be smarter and more ethical daughter&nbsp;
knows she has to save her brother she asks mother&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:57.360
if she can hold him and the droid agrees she lets&nbsp;
go of the axe and cradles her brother in her arms&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:02.640
as she holds the baby in her arms she accuses&nbsp;
mother of murdering her own children she backs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:08.320
away slowly and then with a quick move of the axe&nbsp;
she destroys the doors triggering its lock mother&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:13.360
manages to slip through the door and chases after&nbsp;
her daughter runs to the lab and tries to reload&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:18.960
the gun meanwhile the droids outside are drilling&nbsp;
the door preparing to annihilate her at any second&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:23.840
she manages to load the gun and points it at&nbsp;
mother mother only looks at her and tells her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:29.280
there's no point in shooting her it is artificial&nbsp;
intelligence existing simultaneously in different&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:34.560
droid bodies if she shoots now her consciousness&nbsp;
will only transfer to another droid body&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:39.280
she demands it mother telling it to call&nbsp;
off the attack she tells it that she can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:43.920
take care of her family on her own now she&nbsp;
doesn't need mother's help tears are running&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:47.760
down through her face as she watches mother&nbsp;
caress the head of her brother one last time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:52.480
the droids outside fall silent mother&nbsp;
has finally called off the attack&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:56.480
daughter looks at the droid she has&nbsp;
known his mother as it bids her goodbye&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:01.600
before she changes her mind daughter pulls&nbsp;
the trigger putting an end to mother forever&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:07.200
back at the camp the woman comes face to face&nbsp;
with one of mother's last remaining droids&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:10.560
the droid greets her and tells her that&nbsp;
she has done her purpose and then kills her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:16.240
daughter is now alone in the bunker her tears have&nbsp;
dried up as she sings a lullaby to her brother&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:21.840
she cradles him and holds him close as she&nbsp;
realizes that she is now the new mother
