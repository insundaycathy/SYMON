00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.340
Hi, Mystery Recapped here.

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:09.460
Today I’m going to explain the first two
episodes of an American fantasy drama series,

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.269
“Sweet Tooth,” Spoilers ahead!

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.160
Watch out and take care!

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.210
At the beginning of the episode, a man named
Aditya Singh narrates his daily life as a

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:23.210
doctor.

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.899
He and his wife Rani live a happy and simple
life together.

00:00:26.899 --> 00:00:32.230
Until one day at work, a woman with a strange
disease visits the doctor; her pinky finger

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.190
moves aggressively as a symptom of the disease.

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.460
A new kind of virus named H5G9 is discovered
in her blood.

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.670
The very next day, Aditya goes to work to
see several such cases.

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.350
The government declares the outbreak as an
emergency, claiming that the H5G9 virus is

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.989
the deadliest virus of all time.

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.079
Experts predict the number of infected people
will reach more than it did during the black

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:57.079
plague.

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:01.800
Chaos ensues in the world as shops, factories,
and hospitals start closing.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.090
One day, the doctor wakes up to his wife coughing
on the floor.

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:07.240
She, too, has gotten the virus.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.700
He rushes her to the hospital through the
crowd of people in the same situation.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.009
While at the hospital, Aditya is called by
a nurse who seems to be in shock.

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:21.010
The maternity ward is filled with newborn
babies who all have features of different

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:22.010
animals.

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:27.120
The word soon gets out as every baby in the
world is born as a human and animal hybrid.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.360
People start to hate the babies saying that
they are the ones who caused the virus outbreak.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.760
Others believe that the virus caused such
babies to be born.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:43.380
But no one knows for sure how they came into
existence.

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.540
While the whole world trembles in the fear
of the virus, one father moves into the wilderness

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.630
with his child for protection.

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:55.289
His son, Gus, born as a human deer hybrid,
is one of the first-ever hybrid babies.

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:59.280
The man reaches an abandoned house in the
middle of the woods and reforms it to make

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.399
it his own.

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:04.970
Days pass as he takes care of Gus and reconstructs
the house, making it suitable for them both

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:05.970
to live.

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.140
He even builds a fence around the area to
protect him and Gus.

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.440
He writes books for Gus to read but doesn’t
teach him much about the outside world.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.090
Gus grows up quickly and starts calling his
father Pubba.

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.700
Gus soon turns four years old, still unknown
to the world outside the fence.

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:27.790
Pubba teaches his kid to duck if he hears
a growl, run if he hears a voice, and hide

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.360
if he ever sees a human.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.150
A montage of the father and son playing in
the snow, fishing, reading books, and cooking

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:35.940
together is shown.

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.140
One day while they are out, an airplane passes
overhead.

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.590
Pubba shuts Gus’s ears and tells him it
is just a big bird.

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.930
The plane is distributing pamphlets that advertise
a safe place for hybrids called the preserves.

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.760
He throws the papers away, not wanting to
take the kid into the world.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.640
On one of Gus’s birthdays, he gives him
a stuffed toy which Gus brings everywhere

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:02.230
with him.

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.480
One day, while Gus reads a book in the jungle,
he sees a dear nearby.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.120
He runs to his father to tell him that he
saw his mother.

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.950
Pubba tells him that his mother was a human
named Birdie, and she is no more.

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:19.190
He also claims that there are bad people outside
the fence who harm kids like him, so he should

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.180
never cross the fence.

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.670
One night, Pubba brings out a box with a picture
and stuff from his old life.

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.900
He buries the box in the woods, letting go
of his past completely.

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.810
On Gus’s tenth birthday, Pubba gives him
a slingshot which the boy loves a lot.

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.790
While playing with it, he ends up outside
the fence.

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.820
Before anyone can see him, Pubba grabs the
kid and rushes him back to the house.

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:46.140
He scolds him for putting his life in danger,
making little Gus cry.

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.070
Later that day, a man comes near the fence,
calling for his sister.

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:54.510
Gus threatens the man to go away, claiming
that his sister isn’t there, but before

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.260
leaving, he gets a glimpse of Gus hiding in
the back.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.720
The man marks the fence as an area that has
hybrid humans, revealing that he is actually

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.780
a hybrid children hunter.

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.930
Pubba freaks out and makes Gus hide.

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.020
He goes out to fight the man and doesn’t
return for the whole night.

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:14.060
A scared Gus stays in the dark for the night
and comes outside when the sun rises.

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.469
Just then, Pubba returns with injuries on
himself.

00:04:17.469 --> 00:04:22.539
Gus helps his father and brings him to a bed,
but Pubba knows that he has gotten the virus.

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:26.949
Since hybrid humans are immune to it, he isn’t
worried about Gus getting the virus, but Pubba

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:28.560
has limited time now.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.629
He teaches Gus some basic survival skills
and asks him to get eggs from the ducks for

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:33.629
breakfast.

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:38.150
When Gus returns with them, Pubba is dead
on a seat holding a key.

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:42.370
Gus takes the key and cries quietly, mourning
his father’s death.

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:46.720
After that day, he starts living on his own
and manages to do it to some extent.

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:53.900
He makes animal figures from dried grass and
talks to them to feel less isolated.

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:58.449
After ten winters pass, the boy has learned
to do almost everything he needs to stay alive.

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:01.259
But some days are more difficult than others.

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:05.240
One day, the isolation gets the best of him,
making him burn his animal figures during

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.360
broad daylight.

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.169
The smoke from the fire attracts men, who
hunt creatures like him.

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:14.729
Later that same day, Gus notices a heart drawn
on the forest’s map and goes to look for

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:15.729
it.

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:18.849
It is the place where Pubba had buried the
box with his wife’s picture in it.

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:22.039
Gus opens the box with the key Pubba had with
him when he died.

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:27.139
Gus then looks at his mother’s face for
the first time and sees the picture has “Colorado”

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:28.139
written at the bottom.

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:32.340
With the intention of finding his mom, the
little boy decides to go to Colorado.

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:36.110
He packs everything he needs and takes a map
of the US with him.

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:39.070
After the preparation, the naive kid makes
his way to the fence.

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:44.289
He sees a candy lying on the ground and eats
it but soon finds out it is a trap.

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:48.289
Two hybrid hunters catch the boy and are surprised
to see he can talk.

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:52.770
They know Gus is very valuable, so instead
of shooting him, they decide to hold him for

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:53.770
ransom.

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:57.879
Just then, a man shoots one of the hunters
dead and chases the other one away.

00:05:57.879 --> 00:06:01.900
Gus runs back to his home and hides, but he
is followed by the man who saved him.

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:05.849
He finds Gus and is surprised to see he has
been living alone this whole time.

00:06:05.849 --> 00:06:10.490
At first, Gus seems afraid of him and hits
him with his slingshot several times but soon

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:12.909
realizes he isn’t a bad person.

00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:16.979
The man reveals that he was thinking about
turning Gus in to the officials who use hybrid

00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:18.490
babies for experiments.

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:22.169
But decided against it when he saw Gus is
more human than a deer.

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:26.990
The man calls Gus “sweet tooth” and asks
him to stay inside the fence for his own safety

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:28.469
before leaving.

00:06:28.469 --> 00:06:32.389
After the man is gone, Gus thinks about him
for a while and suddenly decides to break

00:06:32.389 --> 00:06:34.600
all of his father’s rules and goes behind
the man.

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:39.139
He follows him with his amazing ability to
smell and finds the man near a cliff.

00:06:39.139 --> 00:06:44.439
The first episode ends as Gus calls the man
“Big man” and asks him to take him to

00:06:44.439 --> 00:06:45.560
Colorado.

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:49.740
In the second episode, we are introduced to
a woman named Aimee, who used to be a therapist

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:51.280
before the virus outbreak.

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:55.199
She stayed in her office for a few years after
the outbreak, going out only when she had

00:06:55.199 --> 00:06:56.199
to.

00:06:56.199 --> 00:06:59.680
Until one day, when she decides to step outside
for the first time in years.

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:03.199
Outside, everything is abandoned, and the
streets are deserted.

00:07:03.199 --> 00:07:07.490
Suddenly, she notices a herd of elephants
walking in the streets towards her.

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:12.400
Amiee, who was fed up with her tedious everyday
routine, felt alive for the first time in

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:13.400
years.

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:17.460
She visits a zoo nearby and finally finds
what makes her happy.

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:20.090
She starts taking care of the animals and
growing her own food.

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:24.860
Meanwhile, Gus follows Big man even after
being told to go back to his house repeatedly.

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:29.009
The man tries to get rid of the boy several
times but is unsuccessful.

00:07:29.009 --> 00:07:31.800
At night he stops to rest and eats canned
food.

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:35.180
Gus watches him from behind the tree, knowing
that he can see him.

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:37.939
The man gives Gus some food and sleeps.

00:07:37.939 --> 00:07:41.580
While he is asleep, Gus sees his bag is full
of canned food.

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:46.160
He eats all of them, including the man’s
medicines which he desperately needs.

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:50.380
When the man wakes up the following day, he
is furious at the kid and asks him to go back

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:51.509
immediately.

00:07:51.509 --> 00:07:54.749
Gus says that he can help the man collect
more food using his nose.

00:07:54.749 --> 00:07:57.490
He then shows the man a Visitor's Center nearby.

00:07:57.490 --> 00:08:02.800
The man makes him go inside the house to steal
the food while he stays outside to keep guard.

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:06.930
Gus reluctantly walks in and is fascinated
to see different modern things.

00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:12.300
But then, he notices a deer’s head mounted
on the wall and retreats, falling into a trap.

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:14.849
A little boy finds him there and calls his
parents.

00:08:14.849 --> 00:08:19.169
The three watch Gus in awe as he tells them
to leave his head alone.

00:08:19.169 --> 00:08:23.520
In the following scene, we see the family
of three treating the man and Gus to a meal.

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:27.360
They wear masks to be safe from them in case
they have the virus.

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:31.009
It turns out the family had run away from
the city when the outbreak occurred and has

00:08:31.009 --> 00:08:32.919
never met another person since.

00:08:32.919 --> 00:08:36.631
The man tells them that the virus is still
out there, and some people have it, but it

00:08:36.631 --> 00:08:41.390
is not as widespread as it was before because
people live isolated lives.

00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:45.650
The kid named Rusty tries to touch Gus’s
horns but is stopped by his mother.

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:49.180
Gus then shows them his mother’s picture
and asks them if they know her.

00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:51.430
The mother of the family says that she doesn’t.

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:55.540
She allows him and Rusty to play together
after confirming that Gus doesn’t bite.

00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:59.440
The boys soon become friends, and the mother
delightedly watches them play.

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:03.520
At the same time, the father talks to Big
man and recognizes him as a famous football

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:05.270
player Tommy Jepperd.

00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:09.200
Tommy confirms he used to be a sportsman before
the virus outbreak.

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:12.970
When asked what he wants from the family,
Tommy replies that he only wants some food

00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:14.520
and a place to stay for the night.

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:16.650
They agree to help him and Gus.

00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:21.610
Somewhere else, the doctor we saw at the beginning
of the series, Aditya Singh, still lives with

00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:22.610
his wife, Rani.

00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:27.000
Rani has been suffering from the sickness
since its outbreak but is living off medicines

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.890
that a colleague of Aditya makes.

00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:32.740
They still live in their old home but away
from most people, getting out only when they

00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:33.790
have to.

00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:37.960
We see the couple playing scrabble and missing
the fact that there is no internet.

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:42.020
Just then, Rani’s finger starts to move
involuntarily, suggesting that the effect

00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:43.900
of the medicine is wearing off.

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:47.240
The doctor gives her another dose leaving
only one more dose left.

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:50.900
Later that day, he goes to his doctor friend
who manufactures the medicines.

00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:55.520
There, Aditya gets to know that she is in
the last stage of cancer and cannot continue

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:56.770
to work anymore.

00:09:56.770 --> 00:10:01.320
She has been working actively to find a cure
to the virus throughout the years and doesn’t

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:02.820
want her work to go to waste.

00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:07.250
The doctor gives Aditya her notes which also
has the procedure to make Rani’s medicines.

00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:12.100
She sees off Aditya after a last goodbye,
telling him to continue the research.

00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:15.830
Aditya comes back home with the notes and
doesn’t seem too happy about being handed

00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:16.830
the work.

00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:20.090
Rani thinks it is great because Aditya himself
can save her now.

00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:23.130
But then, she looks into the doctor’s notes
and is shocked.

00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:27.590
Aditya claims that his colleague’s gruesome
work goes against everything he believes in.

00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:31.850
Back at the visitor’s center, Tommy and
Rusty’s mother have a chat about Tommy’s

00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:32.850
wrongdoings.

00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:36.610
She calls him out for killing people, and
Tommy claims he did it for survival.

00:10:36.610 --> 00:10:39.150
We do not know what they are talking about
yet.

00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:42.900
Tommy asks the mother to keep Gus with her
family but she doesn’t reply.

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:46.190
Later, the mother puts Gus and Rusty to sleep
together.

00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:50.820
Gus is saddened to see Rusty’s mother taking
care of him and feels a little jealous.

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:55.500
The mother looks at Birdie’s picture again
and recognizes the background as Red Rocks.

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:59.790
At night, Gus cannot fall asleep and goes
downstairs to find Tommy about to walk out

00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:02.020
of the house with all his stuff.

00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:05.870
As they talk, some hybrid hunters approach
the house alerting the two.

00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:09.740
Soon, the family wakes up as well and finds
out the people are looking for Gus.

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:12.860
They are willing to kill everyone to get the
little boy.

00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:16.580
Tommy sees a bear trap mounted on the wall
and attacks the hunters with it.

00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:19.970
He kills most of them, but their leader manages
to get to Gus.

00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:23.820
He is almost about to shoot him but stops
when a deer suddenly appears behind the little

00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:24.830
boy.

00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:28.700
Distracted by the deer, he doesn’t notice
Tommy behind and is killed by him.

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:34.480
It is now the following day; the family apologizes
to Tommy because they cannot keep Gus.

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:37.910
They like the kid, but the family’s safety
is their first priority.

00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:42.560
At last, Gus and Tommy leave for the nearest
town after saying their goodbyes.

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:46.620
In the following scene, we see the former
therapist Amiee working in her zoo.

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:49.330
Suddenly, she hears a noise outside and goes
to check it.

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:54.860
A surprised Amiee finds a little human and
pig hybrid baby outside at the entrance.

00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:59.180
The episode ends as Tommy and Gus go on a
journey that will lead them to paths beyond

00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:00.510
their imagination.

00:12:00.510 --> 00:12:06.060
All the characters are destined to meet and
potentially, change the course of the world.
