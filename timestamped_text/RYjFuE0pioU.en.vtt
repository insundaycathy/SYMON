00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:01.770
Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:07.240
Today, I’m going to explain a comedy, drama,
and fantasy film called “About Time.”

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.600
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.550
Watch out and take care.

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:14.040
The Lake family resides in harmony at their
house by the sea.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:20.350
There's the ever-busy mother, Mary; the always
active father, James; the charming yet absent-minded

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:28.080
uncle, Desmond; the awkward son, Tim, and;
the free-spirited daughter, Katherine or "Kit-Kat."

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.750
Every year, they host a New Year's Eve party
with family and friends.

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.640
At this year's party, Tim navigates through
the crowd feeling awkward and dragged around

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.149
by his friend, Jay.

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:43.450
During the countdown to the new year, a girl
he's been dancing with, Polly, leans for a

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.120
kiss, but he shakes her hand instead, leaving
her disappointed.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.380
The following day, Tim wakes up, overwhelmed
with embarrassment and a terrible hangover.

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.450
He's called into his father's study.

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.629
James, his father, then tells Tim that he's
about to share with him a secret that he's

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:00.120
never told anyone before.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.950
According to James, the men born into their
family, including Tim, can travel back in

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:07.490
time, but it's limited to their own lifetime.

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.040
They cannot go to a past they didn't experience
or a place they've never been to.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.010
To do this, they must go to a dark place like
a large cupboard and think of the place and

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.330
time where they want to be, and they'll find
themselves there.

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.100
Unsurprisingly, Tim thinks this is a joke.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.990
He shakes his head at his father, thinking
that he's pulling his leg.

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.940
To prove that it isn't true, Tim goes inside
the closet and thinks of the New Year's Eve

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.640
party last night.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.680
After a few seconds, he comes out of the closet
and is surprised to see himself dressed in

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.350
his clothes from yesterday.

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.350
Music and conversations echo from downstairs.

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.760
He heads down and is immediately pulled by
Jay, evading a table that he previously knocked

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:45.760
over.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.230
At the countdown, he kisses Polly, who reacts
giddily.

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:53.960
Afterward, Tim goes back into the closet and
travels to the present.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.710
Realizing that the time travel is real, he
listens to his father's experience about the

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.340
ability, discovering that it's how James seemingly
had a lot of time for them.

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.490
James advises Tim not to use the ability for
money or power, so Tim decides that he'll

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.580
use it to find love.

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.650
That summer, Kit-Kat invites her boyfriend's
cousin, Charlotte, to stay at the beach house

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:14.980
for two months.

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.790
As the family sunbathes with their guest one
afternoon, Tim hopes to get on Charlotte's

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.239
good side.

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:24.609
Seeing an opportunity, Tim agrees to put sunscreen
on Charlotte's back but ends up spilling the

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:26.109
bottle on her.

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:30.370
Feeling humiliated, he travels back in time
and acts more casually and carefully about

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:31.430
it.

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.400
Throughout the summer, Tim attempts to impress
Charlotte but fails each time until it is

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.400
too late.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.389
And then finally, it's Charlotte's last day
in the house.

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:43.549
On the evening before she leaves, Tim hopes
to confess his feelings for her but is instantly

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:47.900
shot down before he could, discovering that
Kit-Kat already warned Charlotte that he might

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.359
do this.

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:52.340
Charlotte wonders if things would have turned
out differently if he'd talked to her before

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.129
her last night at their home.

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:55.930
The thought gives him an idea.

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.900
Tim travels back in time to confess to Charlotte
in the middle of summer.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.359
But this time, Charlotte tells him to ask
her again on her last night at their home.

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:08.139
This confirms that he never had a chance with
Charlotte, no matter what.

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:10.769
Tim finally gives up on pursuing her.

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:14.959
The day after Charlotte left, Tim leaves their
home and moves to London, where he stays with

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.389
James' friend, Harry.

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:21.129
Tim is excited for the new chapter of his
life ahead but is disappointed to learn that

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:23.480
Harry is a short-fused playwright.

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.049
In the first six months, Tim hasn't had any
luck in romance, finding that his career as

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:31.049
a lawyer acquaints him mostly with other men.

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:35.120
His luck turns when one night, Jay takes him
to Dans le Noir, the restaurant where the

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.739
guests dine in total darkness.

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:42.340
Here, they are seated next to a woman named
Mary and her friend, Joanna.

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.430
In the darkness, Tim and Mary get to know
each other and have a great time.

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.809
After dinner, Tim and Jay finally meet the
girls face-to-face.

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:54.249
Tim is stunned upon seeing Mary, and it's
pretty evident that sparks have flown as the

00:03:54.249 --> 00:03:56.419
couple lay eyes on each other.

00:03:56.419 --> 00:03:59.159
She gives him her phone number before parting
ways.

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:04.260
Tim walks back home with a skip in his step,
only to be welcomed by Harry's angered growl.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.080
The opening of his play was ruined by the
lead actor forgetting his lines.

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.959
Wanting to make things better, Tim goes back
in time and joins Harry in the theater just

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:13.260
before opening night.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:18.449
He approaches the lead actor, Tom, and convinces
him to practice his lines.

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:22.270
This works, but then another actor forgets
his lines instead.

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.080
Tim goes back in time again and helps him
out.

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.479
The play turns out to be a success.

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:32.550
However, when Tim checks his phone, he realizes
that Mary's number is no longer there.

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:36.639
His travels in time had erased his lovely
evening with Mary.

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:41.000
Feeling distraught, Tim joins an ecstatic
Harry for breakfast the next day.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.979
Harry shares the newspaper where Tim finds
an ad for a Kate Moss exhibition in the city.

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:49.480
Remembering that Mary is a fan of Kate Moss,
he spends the week at the exhibit, hoping

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.060
to run into her.

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.470
After a whole week, Mary finally walks in,
and Tim nervously approaches her.

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:00.080
However, their interaction doesn't go smoothly,
and he learns that Mary now has a boyfriend

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.680
named Rupert.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.539
Tim learns that Mary met Rupert at Joanna's
party.

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:08.960
He learns the details of the party and goes
back in time to stop it from happening.

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.590
Tim arrives at Joanna's apartment and convinces
Mary to leave the party with him before Rupert

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:14.590
arrives.

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:18.860
Mary is a little hesitant, but she feels a
magnetic force pulling her towards him.

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:23.340
As they leave, they brush past Rupert, who
unknowingly walked past his supposed future

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:24.340
girlfriend.

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:28.840
Meanwhile, the two have a lovely dinner where
they get to know each other even more.

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:32.860
Tim ends up walking Mary home, and she invites
him up to her apartment.

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:36.289
The atmosphere turns hot, and they take the
date to the bedroom.

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:40.669
But after awkwardly tripping over Mary's shoes
and having difficulty unclipping her bra,

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:44.370
Tim experiences an awkward first sexual encounter
with Mary.

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:49.400
He decides to go back in time, and this time,
he skips over Mary's shoes and quickly undresses

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:50.400
her.

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.740
This time everything goes well, but Tim knows
he can do better.

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:58.319
After Tim's multiple attempts, the couple
spends the perfect first night of passion.

00:05:58.319 --> 00:06:02.250
Over the following months, their relationship
continues to bloom, and the couple eventually

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:03.870
moves in together.

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:08.750
While at the theater with a coworker named
Rory, Tim encounters Charlotte, but the conversation

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:10.470
quickly turns awkward.

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:13.770
He tries a second time, but it doesn't go
well again.

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:18.449
For the third attempt, he decides not to approach
her, and instead, Charlotte spots him and

00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:20.800
initiates the conversation.

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.120
Charlotte invites him to dinner, where she
mentions her regrets about turning him down

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:25.870
in the past.

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:29.401
Charlotte asks him to walk her to her apartment
and tempts him to go inside with her, but

00:06:29.401 --> 00:06:30.999
Tim refuses.

00:06:30.999 --> 00:06:35.780
Being able to turn down his first love helps
Tim realize how deeply he loved Mary.

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:38.349
He runs back home and wakes her up to propose
to her.

00:06:38.349 --> 00:06:42.400
It ends up not as romantic as he expected,
so he does it again.

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.060
The second time, she says yes.

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:48.370
That summer, Tim takes Mary home to meet his
parents.

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:52.320
Mary and her mother get along, and Tim spends
quality time with his father.

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:56.800
To his surprise, Kit-Kat is also home after
having a horrible time in London.

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:01.860
The Lake family bursts in joy upon the announcement
of Tim and Mary's wedding and Mary's pregnancy.

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:05.690
Their wedding ceremony is filled with romance
and laughter, even though it stormed during

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:07.900
the ceremony and the wedding reception.

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:11.830
The tent is torn and blown by the wind, and
so everyone is forced to take cover in the

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:12.830
house.

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:17.349
Tim goes back in time and switches his best
man when Rory, Harry, and Jay mess up their

00:07:17.349 --> 00:07:20.419
speeches until finally, he chooses his father.

00:07:20.419 --> 00:07:24.820
Months later, Mary gives birth to their daughter,
Posy.

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:29.210
Tim is mesmerized at the experience of raising
a child, both for its precious moments and

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:30.610
the difficulties.

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:34.330
They move into a new house, and soon, it's
Posy's first birthday.

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:39.520
All the guests arrive, including Harry and
Rory, but Kit-Kat is late to the party.

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:45.139
The doorbell rings, and Tim answers it, but
instead of Kit-Kat, it's her troublesome boyfriend,

00:07:45.139 --> 00:07:46.139
Jimmy.

00:07:46.139 --> 00:07:51.050
He and Kit-Kat argued earlier that day which
ended with Kit-Kat driving by herself.

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:54.800
Kit-Kat had been drinking earlier that day,
leading her to crash her car on the way to

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:56.349
Tim's house.

00:07:56.349 --> 00:08:00.500
Hoping to save her, Tim goes back in time
and picks her up from her home instead.

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:02.840
But this doesn't solve the problem.

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:07.020
Kit-Kat maintains a drinking problem stemming
from her unhappy relationship with Jimmy.

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:10.219
Tim talks to his sister, hoping to reach out
to her.

00:08:10.219 --> 00:08:14.129
When it doesn't work, he takes Kit-Kat back
in time during the New Year's Eve party where

00:08:14.129 --> 00:08:15.460
she met Jimmy.

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:19.779
But instead of flirting with Jimmy, she releases
her pent-up anger on him and punches him despite

00:08:19.779 --> 00:08:22.189
him not remembering her in this timeline.

00:08:22.189 --> 00:08:27.180
The siblings go back to the present, and immediately,
Kit-Kat realizes her feelings for Jay.

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:31.870
This time, she dates Jay instead, and their
relationship turns out better than she had

00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:33.029
with Jimmy.

00:08:33.029 --> 00:08:36.950
Having saved his sister's life and happiness,
Tim heads back home but finds that he has

00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:39.820
a son instead of his daughter, Posy.

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:42.479
The sudden realization makes his heart sinks.

00:08:42.479 --> 00:08:46.410
Immediately, he goes into a cupboard and goes
to the past when his son was born to talk

00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:47.830
to James.

00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:51.779
James confirms that any change he makes before
his child is born is likely to result in a

00:08:51.779 --> 00:08:53.920
different child being conceived.

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:58.780
If he wishes to keep Posy, he can never change
anything that happened before she was born.

00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:03.170
Unable to accept losing the daughter he knew,
Tim goes back again in time to undo the changes

00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:06.810
he made to Kit-Kat's life and allows her car
accident to happen.

00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:11.470
With Kit-Kat in the hospital, Tim and Mary
stay by her side until she recovers.

00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:15.550
Their support leads Kit-Kat to decide on changing
her life for the better.

00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:19.230
Remembering the alternate timeline when she's
happy with Jay, Tim suggests for Kit-kat to

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:21.160
start seeing him.

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:24.920
Arriving home from the hospital, Tim relishes
in his daughter's presence.

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:28.000
Their happiness inspires him to have another
child.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.040
Despite Mary's protests at first, they conceive
their son two years later.

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:36.030
One evening, Tim helps Mary prepare to meet
her company's best-selling author, but they

00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:41.230
accidentally leave Posy downstairs, where
she destroys the manuscript from Mary's office.

00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:45.110
Tim wants to use time travel to fix it, but
their night is interrupted by a call from

00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:49.149
his mother, announcing that James has been
diagnosed with terminal cancer.

00:09:49.149 --> 00:09:54.160
Tim, Mary, and Kit-Kat visit the beach house
where Tim talks to his father.

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:58.640
Their time travel cannot undo his cancer without
risking Tim and Kit-Kat's births.

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:02.670
In the end, time travel cannot fix everything
life throws at them.

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:06.589
James gives Tim what he deems is a far more
important lesson for their ability.

00:10:06.589 --> 00:10:10.399
The first is to go through life as normally
as possible, with all the everyday tensions

00:10:10.399 --> 00:10:11.529
and worries.

00:10:11.529 --> 00:10:15.360
Secondly, after he lives the day once for
the first time, he should go back and relive

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:19.190
moments of his life while paying attention
to how sweet the world can be.

00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:23.220
Tim follows his advice and finds happiness
in both the mundane and the special moments

00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:24.389
in his life.

00:10:24.389 --> 00:10:28.790
However, there are still days that he doesn't
wish to relive, such as the day his father

00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:29.810
died.

00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:33.720
Not ready to say goodbye, Tim travels back
in time to visit his father while he's still

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:35.240
in good health.

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:39.199
After James' death, Tim is comforted that
he can still visit his father back in time

00:10:39.199 --> 00:10:40.490
whenever he misses him.

00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:44.589
One day, however, Mary decides that she wants
a third child.

00:10:44.589 --> 00:10:48.959
Tim hesitates, knowing that having a third
child will disable him from visiting his father

00:10:48.959 --> 00:10:49.959
again.

00:10:49.959 --> 00:10:54.269
With much thought, he lets go of the past
and decides to carry on with the future.

00:10:54.269 --> 00:10:56.149
He then agrees to have another child.

00:10:56.149 --> 00:11:00.620
Months later, Mary is heavily pregnant and
will be giving birth soon.

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:04.000
This is Tim's last chance to visit his father
in the past.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.240
He goes back in time and plays table tennis
with his father for the last time.

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:12.870
Seeing the sadness in Tim's eyes, James realizes
that it is their last time together.

00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:16.310
He accepts this and lets him know that he
agrees with his son's decision.

00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:20.470
As a treat, they both travel back in time
to when Tim was a young boy.

00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:24.370
Both in better health and with more energy,
James and Tim run and play by the beach for

00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:25.589
the last time.

00:11:25.589 --> 00:11:29.589
Tim says his final goodbyes to his father
and returns to the present time when his third

00:11:29.589 --> 00:11:31.470
child is born.

00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:36.120
Years pass, and Tim continues with life normally,
spending both the laughs and tears with his

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:37.120
family.

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:41.149
He has completed his family with Mary, while
Kit-Kat also gives birth to her child with

00:11:41.149 --> 00:11:42.269
Jay.

00:11:42.269 --> 00:11:46.399
One morning, he allows Mary to sleep in and
prepares breakfast for his kids, relishing

00:11:46.399 --> 00:11:47.600
their presence.

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:51.980
Tim decides to never time travel again, living
each day as if it's the second time he's lived

00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:52.980
it.

00:11:52.980 --> 00:12:05.660
This time, he focuses on appreciating life,
from the big events to the smallest details.
