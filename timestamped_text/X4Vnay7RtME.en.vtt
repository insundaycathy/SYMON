00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:02.340
Hi, Mystery Recapped here.

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.810
Today, I'm going to explain an American drama
thriller film called “Hide-and-Seek.”

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.570
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:10.266
Watch out and take care!

00:00:14.842 --> 00:00:19.589
Allison Callaway and her 9-year-old daughter,
Emily Callaway, are playing in a park together.

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:25.670
Alison’s husband and psychologist, Dr. David
Callaway, is there too; he watches them play.

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:30.910
At night, Allison and Emily play a game of
hide-and-seek... after which Allison tucks

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:32.619
Emily to bed.

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:34.980
Allison seems to be worried about something.

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.239
David asks her about it, but she dismisses
it.

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:40.010
Allison then goes to take a bath.

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.860
However, around two in the morning, David
wakes up to see Allison still not in bed.

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.809
He goes to check the bathroom, where he is
terrified to see Allison sitting on a bloodied tub

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:52.220
She had committed suicide by cutting her wrist.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.920
Emily stands in the doorway as she watches
David hugging Allison’s body and crying.

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.940
Cut to a few days later, Emily is in a children’s
hospital and seems depressed.

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.220
David talks to his colleague and good friend,
Dr Katherine Carson, and decides that it would

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.771
be best if he and Emily moved to the countryside
for some time.

00:01:09.771 --> 00:01:11.841
Katherine is close to Emily as well.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.130
She hugs Emily and wishes her goodbye, and
they leave.

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.000
Emily brings her cat with her to the new place.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.640
David and Emily are finally at their new home.

00:01:20.843 --> 00:01:24.303
It lies in an area surrounded by woods and
is very quiet.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.490
They are welcomed by a sheriff and the owner
of the house.

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.500
As they are looking around, Emily disappears.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.330
They find her near the woods staring at something.

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.400
That night, Emily doesn’t eat anything and
insists on sleeping early.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.600
David tries to cheer her up, but the girl
is traumatized by her mother’s death.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.830
He then gives her a diary to write down her
feelings, after which Emily wishes her favorite

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.950
doll named Alex goodnight before going to
sleep.

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.750
The following day, David is unboxing his belongings
in his study room, when Emily goes into the

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.780
woods following a butterfly.

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.390
In the end, she sees a cave.

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.190
By the time David starts looking for her,
she is back.

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.330
But her favorite toy doll, Alex, is not.

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.570
Shortly, he and Emily leave to run some errands.

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.219
As David is pumping gas into his vehicle,
he sees a woman playing with a little girl.

00:02:12.219 --> 00:02:15.959
Thinking that the little girl could become
friends with Emily, he introduces himself to them

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:19.250
The woman’s name is Elizabeth Young.

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.200
She seems to have charmed David.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.810
He invites them to come over someday.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.549
That night while tucking Emily to sleep, David
asks her about her doll , Alex... to which

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:31.130
she says that she doesn’t like her anymore.

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.040
She tells him that she has replaced Alex with
her new friend named Charlie.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.860
When David questions her further about Charlie,
she says that he doesn’t like being talked about

00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:42.680
David calls Katherine to tell her about the
incident.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.530
They both agree that Charlie is an imaginary
friend Emily has created to cope with her trauma

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.090
The following day, David finds Alex in the
bin with her face distorted.

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.379
Later at dinner, David tries to talk to her
about Charlie.

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:58.970
At that time, she tells him that Charlie is
a lot of fun like her mommy used to be.

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:02.549
That night, he gets another nightmare.

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:05.790
He has been getting the same nightmare of
the New Year's Eve party that occurred the

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.790
night before Alison's death.

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.520
The nightmare wakes him up exactly at the
time he did when Allison died.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:16.109
He hears a noise, and goes to check in the
bathroom to see the words “you let her die”.

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:19.620
The bathtub is filled, and Emily’s crayon
lay around.

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.030
He turns around and sees Emily behind him...
but when asked about it, Emily insists it

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.489
was Charlie who did it.

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:32.930
The following day, Elizabeth and her niece,
Amy, come over.

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.950
David introduces Amy to Emily, but she seems
to have no reaction.

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.260
As they play, Amy is eager to become friends,
so she hands her doll to Emily.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.879
But when Emily returns it back, its face is
distorted like Alex’s was.

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:48.340
Emily tells Amy that she shouldn’t be here.

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.060
Feeling scared, they leave soon after.

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.280
When David asks Emily about Amy, she replies
she doesn’t need any new friends and that

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.769
Charlie is enough.

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:00.579
Later, Emily plays outside as David does the
dishes.

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:05.115
He sees a man sitting beside her, so he goes
out to check and finds that the man is their neighbor, Steven

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.840
They have an awkward conversation after which
David warns Emily not to talk to strangers.

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.939
Cut to that night, David hears Emily laugh,
but when he goes to check on her, she is alone.

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:20.440
He asks if Charlie is here, but Emily says
that he just left through the window.

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.780
David tries to talk to her about Charlie...
but Emily reveals that Charlie doesn’t like David

00:04:25.529 --> 00:04:28.739
David writes all of this in his journal after
putting her to bed.

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.440
Later, we see Emily play hide-and-seek with
Charlie.

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.150
She goes out of her room, and look around
the house, to look for him.

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.230
She finds a door behind a closet.

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:40.500
It leads to a basement downstairs.

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.190
She walks there...still looking for him, then,
suddenly the lights go off, and she screams

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:46.500
in fear.

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.320
David quickly comes to get her.

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.100
She tells him that Charlie was hiding in the
dark.

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:55.290
The following day, Elizabeth comes over for
dinner.

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:57.011
Emily doesn’t seem to like her.

00:04:57.011 --> 00:05:01.021
Elizabeth tries to have a conversation with
Emily and gives her some books to read.

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:05.670
However, Emily acts hostile towards her and
drops all the books to the floor.

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:08.590
Seeing this, David demands her to go to her
room.

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:10.570
Soon, Elizabeth leaves.

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:14.130
That night, David again wakes up exactly at
2:06.

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.380
There is a noise coming from the bathroom.

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:19.600
He goes in to check and sees the words “Now
look what you’ve done”.

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.840
The bathtub is full of dirty water.

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.160
As David goes in to drain it, he feels something
inside.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.020
It is the dead body of the cat that lived
with them.

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:30.290
Furious, David goes to Emily’s room.

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:34.660
But Emily again insists that it was Charlie.

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:37.190
He then cleans up the mess in the bathroom.

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:42.030
The following day, Emily shows David pictures
she has drawn of Charlie and her mother.

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:50.060
David tries to tell her that Charlie is not
real, but Emily keeps on yelling his name.

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:52.340
That day, Katherine visits them.

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:55.590
Katherine is David’s good friend who is
very close to Emily.

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:57.690
Emily is very excited to meet her.

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:00.640
She suggests David to bring Emily back to
New York.

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:03.050
He tells her that he will consider it.

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:06.660
After she is gone, David goes to Emily’s
room and sees that she has drawn pictures

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:11.890
of her mother killing herself in the diary
he had given her.

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:15.870
Elizabeth comes over again that day, but David
doesn’t hear her knocking, so she comes

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:18.210
in and goes into Emily's room.

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:22.140
She has come to make amends with Emily, but
Emily tells her that she is playing hide-and-seek

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:24.620
with Charlie, and points at the closet.

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:29.610
As Elizabeth opens the closet, she is attacked
by someone and falls down the windows.

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:33.070
After few hours, a sheriff comes over to ask
about Elizabeth.

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:36.970
The sheriff informs David that he had found
Elizabeth's car crashed down the road, and

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:39.490
her niece told him that she had come here.

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:41.920
But David knows nothing about the incident.

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:46.360
The sheriff then asks Emily about her, but
she lies and tells him that she hasn’t seen her

00:06:47.128 --> 00:06:49.918
After he is gone, David senses something wrong.

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:51.771
He sees the window broken.

00:06:51.771 --> 00:06:53.651
Emily is crying hysterically.

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:54.970
She shows him the time.

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:58.250
It is exactly 2:06 again.

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:01.510
David rushes to the bathroom to see some words
written on the shower curtain.

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:03.290
“Can you see now?”.

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:07.210
He opens it and is terrified to see a dead
Elizabeth lying in the tub.

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:11.440
He rushes back to a crying Emily, but she
still insists that it was Charlie.

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.120
She says she cannot tell David anything about
him.

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:16.990
Then, David locks her in the room and rushes
out.

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:20.590
Shortly after, we see someone open the door
for her.

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:24.240
Emily then calls Katherine to tell her she
doesn’t want to play with Charlie anymore.

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:28.530
David, on the other hand, decides to get rid
of Elizabeth’s body.

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:32.230
But when he goes into the bathroom, the body
is already gone.

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:34.500
Emily says that Charlie just left with it.

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:36.310
This has gone too far.

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:40.290
David is now furious and is determined to
find out who Charlie really is.

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:42.420
He runs outside to search for him.

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:46.840
Suddenly, his neighbor Steven appears behind
him, and demands to see Emily because he has

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:48.960
heard noises from their house.

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:52.230
David attacks him assuming that this whole
time.. he is Charlie.

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:54.900
He rushes back to his home and locks the doors.

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:57.350
He tells him to stay away from his daughter.

00:07:57.350 --> 00:08:01.180
Emily hugs him in fear and begs not to make
her see Charlie again.

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:04.930
David then walks into his study room, where
he is surprised to see that none of the boxes

00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:07.070
have been opened since they moved here.

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:08.690
Even the journals are blank.

00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:12.767
He is in shock because he has been in the
study writing his journal several times after the move

00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:15.720
Suddenly, everything comes back to him.

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:18.980
We see that the person Emily met at the cave
that day was David.

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:23.430
He realizes that he has dissociative identity
disorder, and Charlie is not imaginary at

00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:25.850
all: "Charlie" is David himself.

00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:29.060
Whenever "Charlie" would emerge, David would
be in his study.

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:33.219
He also finally recalls the New Year's Eve
party the night before his wife's death.

00:08:33.219 --> 00:08:35.769
He had caught Alison making out with another
guest.

00:08:35.769 --> 00:08:40.399
"Charlie" was created as a way to express
David's rage so that he could murder his wife,

00:08:40.399 --> 00:08:43.085
something the docile David was too decent
to do.

00:08:43.085 --> 00:08:47.296
Emily knew the entire time about her father's
split personality but did not tell him, because

00:08:47.296 --> 00:08:52.176
she was unsure which personality murdered
her mother until "Charlie" killed Elizabeth.

00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:55.890
Every time Charlie comes out, David doesn’t
remember anything.

00:08:55.890 --> 00:09:00.610
When David comes to realize this, Charlie’s
personality completely takes over him.

00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:02.810
He tells Emily that Daddy is gone.

00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:07.050
Luckily, the neighbour has called the sheriff,
who comes to check on David.

00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:09.779
He finds Emily in her room when the lights
go off.

00:09:09.779 --> 00:09:11.899
The sheriff goes downstairs to check.

00:09:11.899 --> 00:09:15.180
However, he is killed by Charlie.

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:17.870
Charlie senses that Emily doesn’t like him
anymore.

00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:21.019
He starts a game of hide-and-seek and starts
to count.

00:09:21.019 --> 00:09:22.920
Emily rushes to her room.

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:24.839
Just then, Katherine arrives.

00:09:24.839 --> 00:09:29.050
As she moves down the basement, Charlie appears
behind her and pushes her down.

00:09:29.050 --> 00:09:31.980
He locks her there, where she finds the sheriff's
dead body.

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:35.920
Emily, on the other hand, locks herself inside
her room.

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:39.670
Charlie breaks the door open, but Emily has
already snuck out through the window and is

00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:41.480
running away to the woods.

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:43.470
She hides in the cave.

00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:46.589
Kathrine takes the Sheriff’s gun and runs
to save Emily.

00:09:46.589 --> 00:09:50.029
Before Charlie can get to Emily, Katherine
reaches the cave as well.

00:09:50.029 --> 00:09:54.427
But Charlie pretends to be David ,and when
she lets her guards down , he attacks her again

00:09:54.674 --> 00:09:59.174
Emily stops Charlie from killing Kathrine
by distracting his attention to herself.

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:05.980
As Charlie moves closer to kill Emily, Kathrine
comes in between them and shoots him to death.

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:10.149
Cut to a few months later, Emily and Kathrine
have moved back to New York.

00:10:10.149 --> 00:10:11.740
They live happily now.

00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:16.290
The movie ends as the camera zooms into Emily’s
drawing of herself and Kathrine, where she

00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:20.410
has two faces suggesting that she might also
have two personalities like her father.

00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:23.110
Now, for the explanation of the movie.

00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:27.240
It is clear by the end of the movie that David
and Charlie are the same person.

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:31.339
David has a mental disorder called dissociative
identity disorder, which is ironic because

00:10:31.339 --> 00:10:34.010
David himself is a psychiatrist.

00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:38.269
When Charlie murdered Allison that night,
David was unknown to any of this.

00:10:38.269 --> 00:10:41.589
Even when they moved houses, Charlie did not
go away.

00:10:41.589 --> 00:10:45.420
Every time Charlie arrives, David is seen
in his study room writing or listening to

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:46.440
music.

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:49.839
But he had never even unboxed his belongings
in that room.

00:10:49.839 --> 00:10:51.690
Even his notebook is empty.

00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:55.990
This suggests that he hallucinated all of
it to avoid coming face to face with his other personality

00:10:57.010 --> 00:11:01.509
In the movie, we also see Emily being hostile;
she even purposely disfigured the face of

00:11:01.509 --> 00:11:02.509
Amy's doll.

00:11:02.509 --> 00:11:04.809
There are 3 possible reasons.

00:11:04.809 --> 00:11:09.240
The first reason is that she might do it out
of dislike for Amy's aunt, Elizabeth.

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:13.490
Second, she might do it in order to frighten
Amy into staying away, so that Charlie wouldn't

00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:14.490
hurt her.

00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:18.800
The third possibility is that Emily was displaying
the pathological side of herself.

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:21.959
That’s my explanation for the movie “Hide-and-Seek.”
