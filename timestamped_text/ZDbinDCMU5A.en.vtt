00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:06.800
Hi, Mystery Recapped here. Today I’m&nbsp;
going to explain an American survival film&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:12.480
called “Frozen,” Spoilers ahead!&nbsp;
Watch out and take care! 
&nbsp;

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:22.880
The movie begins at a New England ski resort on&nbsp;
Mount Holliston. Three friends namely; Dan Walker,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:29.280
Joe Lynch, and Dan's girlfriend Parker O'Neil&nbsp;
have come to the mountains for a ski trip. Dan&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:35.600
and Joe are childhood best friends who go on a ski&nbsp;
trip every year as a tradition. Most of the time,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:41.120
Joe flirts with a female ski lift operator to get&nbsp;
cheaper tickets, but this time, a man stands in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.560
her place. The guys make Parker flirt with the&nbsp;
operator and get them cheap tickets. While she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:52.560
is at it, Joe complains about Dan bringing his&nbsp;
girlfriend to a boys-only trip. It is evident he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:57.840
is not very fond of Parker. She doesn’t even know&nbsp;
how to ski, so Joe thinks it wouldn’t be as fun.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.600
Dan apologizes saying that he thought bringing her&nbsp;
would be okay because they would get to bond. 
&nbsp;

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.440
They finally get on the ski lift and&nbsp;
set off for the top of the mountain.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:13.040
On their way, Joe criticizes Parker for smoking&nbsp;
too much, making Parker throw an insult back at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.680
him. Dan is in the middle of the two trying&nbsp;
to handle the situation. All of a sudden,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:23.360
the lift stops working. People riding them&nbsp;
complain in frustration. Parker acts calm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:29.200
but is scared of heights. Joe makes fun of her for&nbsp;
it while Dan tries to console her. Eventually, the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.960
lift continues working, and they reach the top.&nbsp;
While skiing, Dan and Joe are unable to have fun&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:40.480
because of Parker being slow. She falls down&nbsp;
every few minutes, annoying Joe even more. 
&nbsp;

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.840
At night they are back from the mountain and&nbsp;
are staying in a resort. The boys talk over&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.440
pizza about the failed trip. Joe suggests the&nbsp;
two of them catch the last lift to the hilltop&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.480
and ski like they used to before. Parker overhears&nbsp;
their conversation and apologizes for ruining&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:02.240
their trip. Dan feels bad for her, so he asks her&nbsp;
to join them again. Parker wants to stay in their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:08.400
room saying she doesn’t enjoy skiing anyway, but&nbsp;
Dan insists. So, the three of them re-pack their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:14.400
gears and make their way to the lift. Just as they&nbsp;
reach there, the operator turns the lifts off. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.600
is the same man who Parker had flirted with to get&nbsp;
the tickets. The group asks him to let them go one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:24.640
last time, but the man laughs at them, saying they&nbsp;
didn’t pay the full price even the first time.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.400
Moreover, the lift is closing because of a&nbsp;
storm so they cannot resume it. The operator&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:36.320
is absolute about not letting them go but accepts&nbsp;
when they offer him extra hundred dollars.  
&nbsp;

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:41.680
The group sets off on the lift, looking at&nbsp;
the people below skiing excitedly. Meanwhile,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:47.040
a co-worker approaches the lift operator and tells&nbsp;
him about the next week’s schedule. The operator&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.520
retaliates, saying that he will be off work at&nbsp;
his brother’s wedding the next week. He leaves&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:56.880
the co-worker at the lift to talk to the manager.&nbsp;
Before leaving, he informs him that three people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:02.080
are still on the lift, so he shouldn’t stop it&nbsp;
until they come back. A while after the operator&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.480
leaves, the man sees three people climbing&nbsp;
up the mountain. He assumes that the people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:12.320
are the ones the operator was talking about and&nbsp;
stops the lift, unaware that Dan, Joe, and Parker&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:18.240
are still on it. At first, when the lift stops,&nbsp;
the group thinks it is just a minor inconvenience.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:23.760
Joe yells in frustration, but everyone at&nbsp;
the lift station has already left. Moreover,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.320
the temperature is dropping by the second,&nbsp;
making the group shiver in the cold despite&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:33.280
being warmly dressed. They talk about worse&nbsp;
ways they could die to keep them entertained,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.920
unknown to what is coming for them.
They stay there for a few minutes but start to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.960
panic when the lights go out. Now, they know that&nbsp;
the lift didn’t stop because of a malfunction,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:47.040
but someone has stopped it&nbsp;
deliberately. They start to yell,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.920
hoping someone will hear them. Parker freaks&nbsp;
out, saying that no one knows that they’re here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.480
but Dan believes that the lift stopped because&nbsp;
of some power outage, and they will be rescued&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.840
soon. The couple begins to argue in a moment&nbsp;
of panic. Parker suddenly remembers that it is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:08.160
Sunday, and the ski resort won’t open until next&nbsp;
Friday. So, if no one comes looking for them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:13.280
they will be stuck for almost a week. The&nbsp;
friends tell one another that they will be okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:18.720
but panic is visible in their faces. 
Sometime later, Joe has to pee, but with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:24.880
no other way, he puts the metal bar up and pees&nbsp;
off the lift. Parker groans in disgust while Dan&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:31.440
stays quiet. Then suddenly, it starts to snow. The&nbsp;
storm that the operator warned them about hits,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:36.000
adding to the group’s trouble. Some time&nbsp;
later, a snowplow drives towards them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.360
making the group wave and yell to get the driver’s&nbsp;
attention. The driver finally stops the vehicle&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:46.320
right below the group. They are relieved to&nbsp;
be rescued finally. But it turns out that man&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:51.840
hasn’t heard or seen them and he stopped simply&nbsp;
because of the snowstorm. He calls his superior,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.880
who tells him to come back quickly. So, the&nbsp;
man turns his vehicle around while the group&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:03.360
screams at him to stop. Unfortunately,&nbsp;
he cannot hear them because of the storm.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:10.240
They throw their skiing gears at the man, but he&nbsp;
doesn’t notice them and eventually leaves. 
&nbsp;

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:15.600
Some time later, Parker takes her gloves off to&nbsp;
smoke, but it accidentally falls off the lift.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:21.840
Now, the only way out for the group is for one&nbsp;
of them to jump. Dan volunteers to do it and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:28.800
believes he will be fine since the ground&nbsp;
is covered in snow. Joe tries to stop him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:34.240
saying that they should wait till the morning,&nbsp;
but Dan is adamant. Parker and Joe both repeatedly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:40.960
insist he quit, however, Dan throws his snowboard&nbsp;
to the ground and jumps off the lift. Immediately&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:47.040
after he hits the ground, both of his legs are&nbsp;
broken. The other two ask him if he is okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:52.880
but he only hears mumbling for a few seconds.&nbsp;
Dan is horrified to see bones protruding through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:57.760
both of his knees. Now, there is no way he&nbsp;
can make it down the mountain to get help.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:03.600
Parker throws her scarf at him so he can use it to&nbsp;
stop the bleeding, but it lands on top of a tree.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:11.600
Joe then makes a ball out of his&nbsp;
scarf and throws it at his friend.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.720
It lands nearby, but the bone protrudes out&nbsp;
even more, when Dan tries to reach it. 
&nbsp;

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:23.120
After tying it around his legs, Dan asks Joe&nbsp;
to pull himself up on the suspension cable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:28.720
and get to the nearest support tower. The towers&nbsp;
all have ladders in them, using which Joe can go&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:35.120
downstairs. Joe hesitates, claiming that he can&nbsp;
hardly do a pull up, but agrees to do it for his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:42.240
best friend. Just then, they hear growling nearby.&nbsp;
A pack of wolves have smelled the scent of Dan’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:49.280
blood and are approaching his way. Dan freaks out&nbsp;
and yells for help, inviting the wolves even more.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:55.600
Joe gets on top of the lift but slips back into it&nbsp;
because of the icicles. Just then, a wolf appears&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:55.600 --> 00:07:02.640
right in front of Dan and growls at him. Dan stays&nbsp;
frozen, scared to do anything. Parker throws her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:09.440
snowboard at the animal and makes it go away.&nbsp;
However, soon, he is surrounded by a whole pack of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:16.320
them. Dan realizes there is no way he can survive&nbsp;
now. He asks Joe not to let Parker look down while&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:22.240
the animals surround him. Joe holds Parker’s face&nbsp;
while crying as the creatures devour Dan. 
&nbsp;

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:28.400
Some time later, everything goes silent. The only&nbsp;
noise that can be heard is the howling of wolves&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:34.720
in the distance. Parker blames Joe for asking Dan&nbsp;
to jump earlier. Joe defends himself, claiming&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:39.920
that he begged him not to. They get into an&nbsp;
argument and start to blame one another for Dan’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:46.800
death. In the end, they hold each other and cry.&nbsp;
The night somehow passes as the two fall asleep.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:52.000
Parker wakes up in the morning with her hand&nbsp;
around the metal bar which she had grabbed when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.760
asleep. She tries to remove it, but her hand&nbsp;
is frozen along with the bar. She painfully&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:03.600
loosens her grip as the skin on her palm tears&nbsp;
off. The two have severe frostbites and cannot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:08.960
survive another day in the lift. Joe suggests&nbsp;
he try getting to the support tower again,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:13.760
but Parker wants them to wait for a few hours&nbsp;
and see if someone comes looking for them.
&nbsp;

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:18.560
A while later, Joe falls asleep, and&nbsp;
Parker embarrassingly pees on herself&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:25.920
while crying. When he wakes up, the two talk&nbsp;
about different things in their life; Joe tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:31.520
her how he and Dan met at elementary school. He&nbsp;
claims that since Joe died trying to save them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:36.000
they shouldn't let his death go to waste.&nbsp;
Joe then gets on top of their seat again&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.760
to try to make it to a support tower. This time,&nbsp;
the icicles have melted, making it easier for him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:47.920
to move forward. However, as he steps on the seat,&nbsp;
a screw of the bolt holding the chair to the cable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:54.000
becomes dangerously loose, making the chair rock.&nbsp;
He somehow manages to get to the other chair, but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.120
his palms are bloodied because of the cable. 
Joe still doesn’t give up and climbs up to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:04.400
support tower while a single wolf waits for&nbsp;
them in the ground. Parker throws her ski pole&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:09.600
to the ground to help Joe fight the wolf when&nbsp;
he reaches there. He then finally climbs down,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:15.120
only to be attacked by the animal. However, he&nbsp;
gets his hands on the pole and manages to get it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:20.320
off him. He quickly puts on the snowboard&nbsp;
and skis down the mountain. Right behind,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:25.920
a pack of wolves follows him. Parker asks him to&nbsp;
be careful as he disappears into the mountain.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:32.400
Now, she is alone in the cold, waiting for Joe&nbsp;
to return with help. However, hours pass by,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:36.960
but Joe doesn’t come back. Parker knows that&nbsp;
the wolves must have gotten to him, but she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:42.160
still hopes for his safety. She stays there till&nbsp;
the following morning, but he doesn’t return.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:50.960
Parker then moves around the seat, making the bolt&nbsp;
move more aggressively. Eventually, the seat falls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:57.120
to the ground and lands right on top of her legs,&nbsp;
breaking them. Parker composes herself and crawls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:03.600
downhill on the snow. After a while, she comes&nbsp;
across the horrifying scene of Joe’s remains. 
&nbsp;

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:08.160
Before she can react, Parker notices a wolf&nbsp;
in the front. But since the creature is full&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:13.680
after devouring Joe, it doesn’t attack her. Parker&nbsp;
somehow makes it to the side of the road and lies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:18.880
there waiting for help. Eventually, a person&nbsp;
brings her in their car and drives away.
