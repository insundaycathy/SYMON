00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:05.240
If you got infected by a zombie virus and
only had 48 hours left to live, what would

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:06.749
you do with your baby?

00:00:06.749 --> 00:00:10.640
In this How to Beat video, we’ll follow
the characters, see if we can make better

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:15.570
decisions, and ultimately attempt to beat
the Fracking Virus in, Cargo.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.780
If you think you have a better way, let me
know in the comments!

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.470
We start out following Andy, who’s with
his wife Kay, and his baby, Rosie.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.260
They’re on a float trip through an Australian
river.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.360
They come across another family who’re having
a little birthday picnic, the dad doesn’t

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.920
seem too friendly though.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.450
Andy anchors the boat down for the night,
and fishes out a containment assistance package.

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.480
Okay, so it’s not a fun little float trip.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.841
He pops the package open, and the text on
the first pamphlet reads, “A guide to help

00:00:45.841 --> 00:00:51.460
prepare you and your family to recognize threats
and make smart decisions in dangerous situations.”

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.530
I can tell you right now they didn’t read
this at all.

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.870
Andy flips past all that extraneous bullshit
until he gets to a big colorful picture he

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:00.540
can actually understand.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.110
It looks like Australia is pretty much annihilated
by now.

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.660
To make matters worse, they only have a couple
PB&amp;J’s left.

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:11.890
Andy and Kay are arguing about the plan, which
was originally to float down the river until

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.520
they reach a military base with a nearby hospital.

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.320
Kay’s second guessing that they will make
it with food running low and the possibility

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.760
of the engine failing.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:25.740
She wants to stop the boat, grab a car, and
head 40km inland to a remote town.

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.910
I guess you didn’t understand the big colorful
picture in the pamphlet.

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:35.400
Let me help, you’re traveling down the Murray
River, and according to the red, high infection

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.040
zones on the map, you are not outrunning it,
because it’s all around you.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.870
Even though the infection is everywhere, I
do think that heading for the remote town

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:45.290
is a decent option.

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:50.090
By now Andy and Kay have experienced the initial
onslaught of the virus, and have read some

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:51.280
of that pamphlet.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.810
They should know that the zombies are slow,
easy to avoid, and that the virus is transmitted

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.900
through bodily fluids.

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.010
Driving into a remote town wouldn’t be that
dangerous.

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:04.229
There would be less zombies, and maybe the
town has some unpicked food and supplies.

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.800
It could be a decent place to hold out, have
a nice cold pint, and wait for this all to

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:14.410
blow over.

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.130
With the zombies being slow and uncoordinated,
it’s likely the military successfully fought

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:20.480
the zombies back.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.610
So I'd still make a pass by the base before
spending months on a potato farm.

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.810
What I don’t like is that houseboat.

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:32.330
It can barely push 5-6mph, which makes their
journey to the base take weeks.

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.350
Not ideal when food is an issue.

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.090
Not only that, but it’s slow speed and the
need to park it each night makes it vulnerable

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:39.670
to zombie attacks.

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.760
Just jack a truck, fill it with the gas from
the boat, and since you can go 10 times as

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.860
fast as the houseboat, you can check out both
the military base and the town before your

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:48.960
food runs out.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.709
Andy convinces Kay to stay the course, and
they continue floating towards the military

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:53.709
base.

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:57.880
We cut over to a little kid surviving on her
own, using a rock and tree branch to simulate

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.010
watching Netflix.

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.830
Man, things are pretty dire.

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.050
A lot of people would have hung themselves
from a tree before this point.

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.770
Andy spots a wrecked boat named Serendipity.

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:08.430
You gotta appreciate the irony.

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.220
He jumps on top and sticks an oar down the
hatch with a mirror attached to see if anyone’s

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:14.220
home...clever.

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.370
I’d also bang on the side of the boat to
see if I could rustle up a person or zombie

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:19.370
lurking within.

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.890
There didn’t appear to be anyone in the
boat, so he hops down into it.

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.959
He’s barehanded, which is never a good idea
when looting in the zombie apocalypse.

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:29.920
There’s usually a bathroom in these boats
too.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.530
With his mirror he should be able to see if
the door was closed.

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.959
Since it was closed, he should be extra cautious
about a zombie sitting on the toilet.

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:42.910
Andy hits the jackpot and starts bagging the
canned food and wine, but all the commotion

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:48.129
awakens the toilet zombie.

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:52.129
If these were 28 weeks later zombies, Andy
would definitely be dead.

00:03:52.129 --> 00:04:00.940
He hightails the goods back to the houseboat
where he reveals the discovery to Kay.

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.830
Of course he lies about it being perfectly
safe so she doesn’t freak out about how

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:05.959
dangerous it was.

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:10.440
God forbid you’re honest and say that yah,
it was way too risky and dangerous and that

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.379
you shouldn’t have done it, and that you
think there was something in the boat’s

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:14.379
bathroom.

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:18.590
Andy goes off to take a nap, and Kay decides
to sneak off to the wrecked boat.

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:19.790
Why, just why?

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:25.150
Yah, Andy said it’s safe, but there is no
legitimate reason to go back to that boat.

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.600
At least Andy had a reason, that they were
running out of food.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.130
But now that they have enough food to continue
their trip down the river without going hungry,

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.730
there’s no reason to take these kinds of
risks.

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:39.560
Why does she have to sneak off too, it’s
the apocalypse, a little teamwork and communication

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:59.030
goes a long way.

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:03.510
Kay basically gets killed because she wanted
to surprise her husband with a fucking razor

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:07.400
for his beard, which apparently is a very
pressing issue to her.

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:08.850
At least she got it.

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:12.860
Andy wakes up from his nap, only to find his
bloody mess of a wife in the bathroom with

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:14.930
a severe bite wound on her thigh.

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:19.530
Kay throws on a watch that came with the containment
package, which shows how many hours of life

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:20.580
you have left.

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.840
Damn, FitBits have gotten hardcore.

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:28.300
According to Kay’s, she has 48 hours until
she’s a zombie, probably much less considering

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:29.800
how badly she was bitten.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:34.090
Andy throws all containment considerations
out the window and handles her bloody wound

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:35.490
with his bare hands.

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:37.240
Just don’t itch your eye man.

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.150
Kay gives the pamphlet a second read.

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:43.990
It says the infected can’t spread the disease
until symptoms appear, which could be in a

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.990
few hours.

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:49.910
Realistically, Kay’s bloody wound is already
contagious, and how fast the virus takes over

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:53.949
the body actually depends on how and where
the disease was transmitted.

00:05:53.949 --> 00:05:58.389
It's not like you want to hangout until they
start coughing to quarantine or dispatch them.

00:05:58.389 --> 00:06:03.740
The pamphlet also says the auto-injector makes
dispatching the infected as easy and safe

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:04.740
as possible.

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:09.930
Oh that needle isn’t a vaccine, it’s a
way to kill yourself.

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:11.729
Holy shit that needle is intense.

00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:15.770
That looks like the needle Nicolas Cage used
in the movie The Rock.

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:19.670
You’re supposed to put it up to your temple
and hit the quick release button if you get

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:20.670
infected.

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:21.670
Wow.

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:24.270
You know the situation is bad when the government
is handing out ways to kills yourself instead

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:25.590
of vaccines or antidotes.

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:30.330
Andy’s in denial about her bite wound, and
thinks a river monster bit her instead.

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:33.370
It’s pretty obvious it was a zombie though.

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:39.360
Ya know, a testing kit would have been nice
to include in the containment assistance package.

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:43.139
I know it’s hard to come to terms with the
fact that she’s a goner, but you can’t

00:06:43.139 --> 00:06:45.830
let your denial lead you into making more
bad decisions.

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:49.310
It’s time to say your goodbyes and auto-ject
her from the boat.

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:53.199
He wants to take her to the hospital in the
remote town, because he thinks that she will

00:06:53.199 --> 00:06:54.840
bleed to death in a few hours.

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:59.180
If on the offshoot he’s right, and it wasn’t
a zombie that bit her, he thinks the doctors

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:01.000
could stop her from bleeding out.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.350
If he’s wrong and she is infected, well,
she’s dead anyways.

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:06.919
The problem is that his assumptions aren’t
accurate.

00:07:06.919 --> 00:07:10.580
Her wound is oozing dark blood, which suggests
veinous bleeding.

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:14.419
Her wound is not life-threatening, and she
will not bleed out in hours.

00:07:14.419 --> 00:07:18.360
Veinous bleeding can be stopped with 10 minutes
of direct pressure and leg elevation.

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:23.289
I’d cancel that trip to the hospital, quarantine
her on shore immediately so she doesn’t

00:07:23.289 --> 00:07:27.199
spread the disease all over the boat, then
pull out the lawn chair and watch her slowly

00:07:27.199 --> 00:07:30.770
turn into a zombie.

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:31.770
The hell it is.

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:34.800
Oh, it’s your call because you got killed
for a Gilette.

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:40.110
The best a man can get is a partner that doesn’t
take unnecessary risks in the zombie apocalypse.

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:42.760
Andy already risked his life to get the food.

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:43.819
You were set.

00:07:43.819 --> 00:07:46.229
All you had to do was sit on the boat and
have a glass of wine.

00:07:46.229 --> 00:07:49.710
I guess it wasn’t her call as they went
with Andy's idea.

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:53.730
Since there are zombies roaming about, it’s
a good idea to stay in eye contact at all

00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:58.800
times, use hand signals, have non-verbal ways
to communicate like clapping rocks together,

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:03.880
have lures to distract zombies with, and having
ranged weapons like spears to defend yourselves

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:04.880
with.

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:08.509
Not an hour into their journey, they run into
burnt corpses, with their heads buried in

00:08:08.509 --> 00:08:11.100
the ground and spears buried in their skulls.

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:15.491
Normally, I'd say this is free food for the
iron-stomached survivors, but I don’t think

00:08:15.491 --> 00:08:20.300
you can cook off the Fracking Virus so as
enticing as it sounds, eating the fried zombie

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:22.680
corpses probably isn’t a good idea.

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:27.099
We cut back to the lone child again, who’s
storyboarding her next Netflix episode.

00:08:27.099 --> 00:08:29.850
She’s housing and feeding a zombie too,
nice.

00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:31.919
I bet that won’t be a problem later.

00:08:31.919 --> 00:08:37.189
Kay’s leg wound is so severe she’s hopping
around, shopping for baby seats, making toys,

00:08:37.189 --> 00:08:39.669
and playing pattycake with her baby.

00:08:39.669 --> 00:08:44.149
Did you just forget that you are hours into
an incubation period for an incredibly deadly

00:08:44.149 --> 00:08:53.300
and infectious disease that turns people into
zombies, and what you’re doing is fucking

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:56.670
dangerous?

00:08:56.670 --> 00:09:02.179
Why the sweet Australian outback fuck would
you touch this sick ass yellow goop.

00:09:02.179 --> 00:09:04.529
I’m losing my patience with this chick.

00:09:04.529 --> 00:09:08.110
Andy, please dome her with the auto-dispatcher
already.

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:10.429
She’s going to get your baby killed.

00:09:10.429 --> 00:09:15.379
Hopefully Kay disinfects her hand before she
touches anyone else, but we know that’s

00:09:15.379 --> 00:09:16.379
not gonna happen.

00:09:16.379 --> 00:09:20.869
All that stuff about communication, eye contact,
weapons, lures, would’ve been nice to have

00:09:20.869 --> 00:09:21.869
with the zombie approaching.

00:09:21.869 --> 00:09:25.100
I’ll give her some credit for the turn signal
move, though.

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:29.119
Luckily Andy receives the warning and hops
in the car before the zombie catches him.

00:09:29.119 --> 00:09:34.440
I’ve been waiting for a chance to say that
driving 55 mph is the most fuel efficient

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:37.920
speed, and saving gas is definitely a concern
in the apocalypse.

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:42.259
Feels good that this factoid is off my chest,
maybe it will save someone’s life one day,

00:09:42.259 --> 00:09:43.259
who knows.

00:09:43.259 --> 00:09:48.300
If anything I say in any of my videos ever
leads to your survival, like you were in a

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:52.970
situation and thought, oh, Nerd Explains said
this, and it saved your life, please let me

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:53.970
know.

00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:57.110
If it gets you killed, well, nobody will know.

00:09:57.110 --> 00:10:01.269
Andy pulls over to check the map, because
Kay apparently can’t work the map while

00:10:01.269 --> 00:10:02.619
he drives.

00:10:02.619 --> 00:10:06.990
Rosie starts crying because she needs a diaper
change.

00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:08.540
Why would you let her do it?

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:13.050
Kay is hours into an infection, and will be
showing severe symptoms anytime now.

00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:17.139
She shouldn’t be around you in the car,
nor should she be handling the baby and changing

00:10:17.139 --> 00:10:18.139
it’s diaper.

00:10:18.139 --> 00:10:22.179
She should be in the trunk so she isn’t
spreading her bodily fluids everywhere.

00:10:22.179 --> 00:10:25.579
Oh my fucking god.

00:10:25.579 --> 00:10:28.829
That baby could have easily been coughed or
puked on.

00:10:28.829 --> 00:10:32.540
Looks like the kids zombie friend breached
containment, who’d have thought feeding

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:35.730
zombies like zoo animals was a bad idea.

00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:37.759
Ooh that doesn’t look good.

00:10:37.759 --> 00:10:43.759
I don’t think she has 48 hours.

00:10:43.759 --> 00:10:47.619
Finally she gets hit with some sense, but
Andy can’t help himself and throws her back

00:10:47.619 --> 00:10:48.619
in the car.

00:10:48.619 --> 00:10:52.540
He starts speeding down the dirt roads to
get to the definitely abandoned hospital so

00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:57.879
he can salvage a few extra hours with his
wife, when out of nowhere a ninja zombie shows

00:10:57.879 --> 00:11:03.009
up and causes him to swerve off the road and
into a tree, totaling the truck and his wife.

00:11:03.009 --> 00:11:05.370
I’m more sad about the car at this point.

00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:10.180
As ridiculous as this was, if you’re in
the apocalypse with roaming zombies everywhere,

00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:11.779
maybe keep your eyes on the road.

00:11:11.779 --> 00:11:13.660
Andy faints from a panic attack.

00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:16.839
When he wakes up, he sees ‘save her’,
written in blood.

00:11:16.839 --> 00:11:20.160
And this..

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:26.579
I’m sure she’ll be fine bro, just pull
the tree stump out of her stomach and carry

00:11:26.579 --> 00:11:27.670
her to the hospital.

00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:32.309
Kay’s transformation into a zombie is complete,
and she bites his arm with her disgusting

00:11:32.309 --> 00:11:33.869
yellow crusty mouth.

00:11:33.869 --> 00:11:38.739
So she had time to write ‘save her’ in
her own blood, but not to auto-ject herself

00:11:38.739 --> 00:11:43.130
before she turned into a zombie with her passed
out husband and baby next to her.

00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:47.790
You know Kay, it’d be easier to save Rosie
if you didn’t let yourself turn into a zombie

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:49.100
that attacked us.

00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:57.959
Andy finally auto-jects Kay's head, putting
an end to her madness.

00:11:57.959 --> 00:12:03.009
He throws Rosie into his backpack, straps
on the grossly inaccurate watch, and heads

00:12:03.009 --> 00:12:04.009
out.

00:12:04.009 --> 00:12:07.790
The kid baits the zombie away from Andy using
blood handprints.

00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:11.899
Why couldn’t you have done that earlier
when your zombie was in the road that the

00:12:11.899 --> 00:12:13.269
car was driving down.

00:12:13.269 --> 00:12:18.949
Andy makes it to the town and stumbles into
a lady who asks what time is left on his watch,

00:12:18.949 --> 00:12:20.480
not like it matters though.

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:26.100
She offers him a spare bed, which is nice,
but come on, 46 hours is only if someone sneezes

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:27.100
on you.

00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:30.730
This guy was bit on the arm, by morning he
could be zombified.

00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:33.179
Kind of dangerous to have him chilling around.

00:12:33.179 --> 00:12:37.819
Off in the distance, aborignal tribes are
shish kebabing and frying zombies.

00:12:37.819 --> 00:12:41.679
You know, this isn’t too far off from the
lifestyle I was imagining at the end of the

00:12:41.679 --> 00:12:43.429
Assimilate video I did.

00:12:43.429 --> 00:12:45.620
Whaddya know, the hospital is derelict.

00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:50.149
I’m not sure what Andy’s looking for in
the hospital, it’s not like there’s an

00:12:50.149 --> 00:12:51.149
Antidote.

00:12:51.149 --> 00:12:54.629
Maybe he’s looking for an easier way to
off himself by ODing on drugs.

00:12:54.629 --> 00:13:01.259
I don’t blame him.

00:13:01.259 --> 00:13:14.790
Yep, there’s no way this dude is making
it the full 48.

00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:16.970
This man just can not get a good shave in.

00:13:16.970 --> 00:13:20.279
He wakes up in a makeshift bed with spare
clothes next to him.

00:13:20.279 --> 00:13:22.519
It’s pretty clear Etta saved his ass.

00:13:22.519 --> 00:13:27.149
She tells him to go find Willie and to avoid
the hunting parties that are hunting the infected.

00:13:27.149 --> 00:13:31.100
Why not tell her that Willie was a zombie,
and that the best option would be to leave

00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:36.100
Rosie in Etta’s care while Andy enjoyed
his last moments with her, instead of hiking,

00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:39.309
fighting zombies, and risking Rosie’s life
even more.

00:13:39.309 --> 00:13:43.109
Andy heads off in search of the zombie dad
for god knows what reason.

00:13:43.109 --> 00:13:46.649
Ah, he’s trying to make it to the military
base.

00:13:46.649 --> 00:13:48.959
Looks like the military didn’t do so hot.

00:13:48.959 --> 00:13:52.769
Andy finds another truck to jack, so he can
go check out the destroyed military base I

00:13:52.769 --> 00:13:56.230
guess.

00:13:56.230 --> 00:14:03.119
He gets really lucky that guy comes in with
the clutch over the shoulder shot.

00:14:03.119 --> 00:14:07.999
Yah they are slow, but you can never underestimate
how sneaky those ninja zombies are.

00:14:07.999 --> 00:14:11.230
The man tells Andy that the military base
is overrun.

00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:15.959
Apparently he got his leg pinned under a canister
of some sort, so he offers Andy a deal.

00:14:15.959 --> 00:14:19.209
Help him and he’ll take him back to his
home where his wife can help with Rosie.

00:14:19.209 --> 00:14:23.279
Andy agrees, and they haul ass before more
Zombies show up.

00:14:23.279 --> 00:14:26.980
Vic lives in a nice gated community, and we
get introduced to his wife.

00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:30.550
He doesn’t seem like her type, then again,
it’s the apocalypse.

00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:34.860
Andy leaves the baby with Lorraine, and the
boys go on their hunting trip.

00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:36.339
Honestly this looks like fun.

00:14:36.339 --> 00:14:42.509
This is about as good as the zombie apocalypse
is going to get.

00:14:42.509 --> 00:14:47.449
Ohhhh, poor little thoomie.

00:14:47.449 --> 00:14:52.429
Thoomie did inadvertently cause you to crash
and get bit by Kay by letting his zombie dad

00:14:52.429 --> 00:14:53.429
loose.

00:14:53.429 --> 00:14:54.429
Just saying.

00:14:54.429 --> 00:14:58.429
Any one of those bullets could have killed
the bait, which is just reckless on Vics part.

00:14:58.429 --> 00:15:02.509
It does seem like the blood and meat work
just fine, and you don’t need live bait,

00:15:02.509 --> 00:15:06.009
this guys just doing this because he’s a
psycho.

00:15:06.009 --> 00:15:10.169
Vic still is one of the only options for securing
a new home for your baby, so it’s probably

00:15:10.169 --> 00:15:13.360
not wise to piss him off by expressing your
disapproval.

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:19.329
Back at home, Lorraine is playing with Rosie,
until she makes a terrible discovery.

00:15:19.329 --> 00:15:25.029
Ooh maybe letting Kay play with the baby wasn’t
a good idea after all.

00:15:25.029 --> 00:15:27.509
Looks like our pal drummed up some more live
bait.

00:15:27.509 --> 00:15:32.079
He cranks on some jams, splashes some blood
on the cage, and heads back to base to make

00:15:32.079 --> 00:15:34.379
love to his unwilling ‘wife’.

00:15:34.379 --> 00:15:38.499
Lorraine didn’t seem to mention that Andy’s
baby is infected, which makes it even more

00:15:38.499 --> 00:15:41.100
idiotic that he’s cuddling and kissing her.

00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:45.059
Maybe the goo was from Andy, which is still
idiotic because he was getting infectious

00:15:45.059 --> 00:15:47.779
zombie goo all over his babies clothes.

00:15:47.779 --> 00:15:50.149
You know how much babies put stuff in their
mouths.

00:15:50.149 --> 00:15:53.259
The recklessness is just fucking astounding.

00:15:53.259 --> 00:15:57.160
Andy starts seizing again, and kisses his
baby on the forehead before heading outside

00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:05.790
to dome cap himself.

00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:09.799
They really lied on the auto-ject that it
made dispatching easy.

00:16:09.799 --> 00:16:12.350
Why not include a poisonous pill or something
instead.

00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:16.929
I could easily see someone fucking this up
and holding it too far away or aiming it off

00:16:16.929 --> 00:16:20.229
center and accidentally lobotomizing themself.

00:16:20.229 --> 00:16:23.629
Lorraine stops him because she wants his help
to get away from Vic.

00:16:23.629 --> 00:16:27.209
Andy mentions that there’s a family by the
river that she could take the baby to.

00:16:27.209 --> 00:16:32.329
Yah, that dad looked real inviting, it’s
definitely worth the 40km trek back to them,

00:16:32.329 --> 00:16:34.259
if they are still even there.

00:16:34.259 --> 00:16:39.699
As sucky as it sounds, she just needs to stay
shacked up with this dude, play along, convince

00:16:39.699 --> 00:16:43.720
him to teach her how to shoot and hunt so
she can survive on her own, then auto-ject

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:45.329
him while he’s sleeping.

00:16:45.329 --> 00:16:49.759
Since Vic caused the death of her real husband,
I think the auto-ject is too painless.

00:16:49.759 --> 00:16:53.829
She should save some of that yellow goop on
the baby from earlier and put it in one of

00:16:53.829 --> 00:16:54.829
Vic’s meals.

00:16:54.829 --> 00:16:58.129
Vic catches them conspiring and rifle butts
him in the head.

00:16:58.129 --> 00:17:02.189
Andy wakes up in the cage with Thoomie.

00:17:02.189 --> 00:17:08.240
That is probably one of the worst designed
cages I've ever seen.

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:12.079
I get that he might only have access to an
animal cage like that, but why not chain them

00:17:12.079 --> 00:17:14.399
to the cage, instead of just to each other.

00:17:14.399 --> 00:17:18.179
Andy and Thoomie sneak back into camp to free
Lorraine and Rosie.

00:17:18.179 --> 00:17:19.549
Why would you not shoot him?

00:17:19.549 --> 00:17:21.819
He’s too dangerous to be left alive.

00:17:21.819 --> 00:17:25.970
If during your escape, the baby cries or someone
knocks something over, Vic could still grab

00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:30.620
a gun and come out and shoot you, he’s a
pretty good shot too.

00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:35.240
Yep, Vic wakes up and rushes outside with
his rifle.

00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:39.500
As he draws down on Andy, Lorraine jumps out
to stop him and gets shot dead.

00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:43.540
Thoomie and Andy escape and make a stop by
the Clever Man’s cage, but he’s gone.

00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:47.990
I’m sure he figured out he could just lift
the cage door and walk out too.

00:17:47.990 --> 00:18:00.039
Vic catches up to them and poses an enticing
offer.

00:18:00.039 --> 00:18:06.240
I don’t know what they’re waiting for,
Vic sounds like a man who will definitely

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:07.639
honor his side of the deal.

00:18:07.639 --> 00:18:11.889
Why is Andy going to sleep with Thoomie and
the baby when he’s in the late stages of

00:18:11.889 --> 00:18:16.000
infection, he could turn at any point now.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:23.309
Wow, Thoomie’s lucky he didn’t go for
her face instead.

00:18:23.309 --> 00:18:27.451
And why are you sleeping, you literally have
hours before you’re dead, you need to be

00:18:27.451 --> 00:18:29.279
finding a new home for Rosie.

00:18:29.279 --> 00:18:35.580
Andy gives Thoomi a reality check, that her
zombie dad is dead and there’s no cure and

00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:37.700
the clever man can’t fix her dad.

00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:41.790
The talk didn’t go over well, as she tries
to off herself with a rock.

00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:46.570
And I thought the auto-ject was a hard way
to commit suicide.

00:18:46.570 --> 00:18:56.870
Thoomie and Andy go separate ways and Andy
heads for the river to find the family they

00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:58.440
passed by earlier.

00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:02.309
With only 9 hours left of life, he’s really
starting to lose it.

00:19:02.309 --> 00:19:06.980
Just before Andy buries his head in the ground
like those other zombozos, Thoomie comes to

00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:07.980
the rescue.

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:12.049
They miraculously find a boat with an engine
and eventually Andy’s reunited with the

00:19:12.049 --> 00:19:16.210
houseboat, memories of Kay, and thoughts of
how this could have gone down differently

00:19:16.210 --> 00:19:19.179
if she just poured a glass of wine instead.

00:19:19.179 --> 00:19:22.200
It doesn’t seem like things turned out hot
for the family.

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:26.920
You know that dude had a gun, so maybe don’t
sneak into their home and eat their food without

00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:28.490
knowing if they’re still around.

00:19:28.490 --> 00:19:30.750
I’d yell to see if they were home.

00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:34.440
Sure you could attract some zombies, but I'd
rather deal with a zombie than a guy with

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:35.440
a gun.

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:39.860
I’m also still dumbfounded that Andy hasn’t
found something to use as a weapon against

00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:44.200
the zombies this whole time.

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:49.779
Thanks doctor thoomie, for the history lesson
about why modern medicine and technology has

00:19:49.779 --> 00:19:52.009
rendered your culture obsolete.

00:19:52.009 --> 00:19:55.330
They find the river people, but the dad is
digging a mass grave.

00:19:55.330 --> 00:19:59.840
The man tells Andy that after he offs his
family with 4 bullets, there will be 2 bullets

00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:01.429
left for him and Rosie.

00:20:01.429 --> 00:20:05.539
I’d say that Andy should try to take the
gun and stop him, as the wife is the best

00:20:05.539 --> 00:20:07.679
chance at Rosie being taken care off.

00:20:07.679 --> 00:20:26.820
Andy declines the offer and heads back to
the boat.

00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:31.000
If I was going to murder my family to mercy
kill them, I’d fish out an auto-ject and

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.860
dome each one while they slept, this way you
wouldn’t have to see the look of horror

00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:38.049
on their faces as they don’t understand
why you’re killing them.

00:20:38.049 --> 00:20:42.490
While Andy contemplates using the revolver
on himself, Rosie is sucking on his bloody

00:20:42.490 --> 00:20:43.490
fitbit.

00:20:43.490 --> 00:20:48.419
I feel like you have to really, really, really
try to get this disease, so how did it spread

00:20:48.419 --> 00:20:49.440
so fast.

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:54.179
Is that really what’s on your mind right
now, after witnessing a man murder his family

00:20:54.179 --> 00:20:56.590
while you had the same gun he used in your
mouth.

00:20:56.590 --> 00:21:00.409
They really should have headed to Thoomi’s
tribe instead of the family in a van down

00:21:00.409 --> 00:21:01.440
by the river.

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:09.080
Look, that's you in a few hours Andy.

00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:13.220
If they needed to hibernate and slow metabolism,
why not lie down instead.

00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:17.110
And if they need the dark, why are you taking
me through a dark tunnel.

00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:19.919
Unfortunately, they run into Vic again.

00:21:19.919 --> 00:21:23.429
Andy pretends to be a zombie, which is really
not a good strat.

00:21:23.429 --> 00:21:28.409
If that dude used his rifle like he did earlier
to dispatch the zombies, you’d be screwed.

00:21:28.409 --> 00:21:31.410
If the zombies woke up, you’d be screwed.

00:21:31.410 --> 00:21:35.460
Andy should have run up on him with the gat
and emptied it in Vic’s chest.

00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:40.220
Just before Vic bats his head in, Andy flips
the script and opens fire.

00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:45.670
Andy should have fired both rounds, because
Vic grabs the gun and puts a hole in Andy

00:21:45.670 --> 00:21:46.670
too.

00:21:46.670 --> 00:21:51.399
Vic knocks Thoomie out, and in a fit of rage
almost cranks little Rosie's neck sideways,

00:21:51.399 --> 00:21:55.450
but doesn’t because that would’ve made
this movie obscenely dark and disturbing.

00:21:55.450 --> 00:21:59.980
Andy helps Thoomie shake off the tweety birds
so they can continue their trek to her family.

00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:04.400
He starts succumbing to the disease, and gets
the eye goop and flesh eating libido.

00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:07.259
Knowing his death is imminent, they forge
a new plan.

00:22:07.259 --> 00:22:11.559
So not only does the government give you a
way to kill yourself, but also shackles and

00:22:11.559 --> 00:22:12.559
a mouthguard?

00:22:12.559 --> 00:22:15.280
Why, so you can tie up zombies?

00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:19.790
Thoomie’s fam is demolishing the zombies,
but why aren’t they wearing more armor?

00:22:19.790 --> 00:22:24.330
And why are they waiting until the zombies
get close to kill them, just use the throwing

00:22:24.330 --> 00:22:25.679
spears, those seem to be effective.

00:22:25.679 --> 00:22:30.070
The zombie piggyback ride is a nice flex,
but Thoomie definitely could have carried

00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:32.350
the baby a couple more miles herself.

00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:34.200
Seems like an unnecessary risk.

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:38.440
The clever man was out there running zombies
through too, so it’s safe to say he didn’t

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:41.149
have the cure that Thoomie was waiting on
for her dad.

00:22:41.149 --> 00:22:46.039
Andy finds mercy at the end of a spear and
the tribe takes the baby into their home.

00:22:46.039 --> 00:22:47.059
The movie ends.

00:22:47.059 --> 00:22:51.260
Let’s recap some of the big decisions that
could have altered the course of events, and

00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:53.840
see who we could save, and whose death was
inevitable.

00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:58.650
I’m pretty sure no matter what we did differently,
Kay would find a way to get herself killed,

00:22:58.650 --> 00:23:01.049
so i’m putting her on the dead board permanently.

00:23:01.049 --> 00:23:05.380
They definitely should have jacked a car instead
of the boat, which means the food wouldn’t

00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:08.070
be as much of an issue to go looting wrecked
boats for.

00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:12.629
They’d stop by the military base, see that
it was overrun, then head to the remote town

00:23:12.629 --> 00:23:14.379
to find Etta and the aboriginals.

00:23:14.379 --> 00:23:18.000
There, they could hold out the apocalypse
relatively safely.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.450
So Andy, Rosie, Thoomie, Etta, Vic, Lorraine,
and the Tribe would all be alive.

00:23:22.450 --> 00:23:26.669
They’d still have to deal with Vic at some
point, because he was putting them in cages.

00:23:26.669 --> 00:23:31.279
His cages didn’t seem hard to escape, so
whoever was captured could free themselves

00:23:31.279 --> 00:23:34.539
and gather the tribe to hunt him down and
free Lorraine.

00:23:34.539 --> 00:23:38.750
So Vic using people as live bait will probably
still lead to his death.

00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:41.610
The river family and willie were dead either
way.

00:23:41.610 --> 00:23:45.990
Ultimately, I think we could have beaten Andy
and Kay’s encounter with the Fracking Virus.

00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:51.110
Thanks for watching, and remember, lack of
communication is the number one relationship

00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:54.500
killer, especially in the apocalypse.
