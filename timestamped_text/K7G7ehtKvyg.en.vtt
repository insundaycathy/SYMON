00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:07.920
Brad Ryan and Dina are the first victims&nbsp;
in saw 3D trapped in a glass cube in a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:13.600
public space they are about to fall victims to&nbsp;
circular saws as a quick fresh up for those of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:18.880
you who haven't watched the movie recently Dina&nbsp;
tricked both men into spending for her treats&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:25.440
what this means she's basically a gold digger&nbsp;
and jigsaw doesn't like gold diggers she is toxic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:30.480
there are two circular saws fixed on both&nbsp;
ends of what seems to be mini rails we have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.400
one character on each side with their hands&nbsp;
chained onto the sliding device on both sides&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:42.480
of each respective circular saw obviously they&nbsp;
need to push the contraption towards each other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.400
in order to avoid getting sliced open as well&nbsp;
as to attempt to slice open the other person&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:54.320
they have one minute time if none of them fall&nbsp;
victim to the game Dina hanging above will get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:01.520
sliced in half instead we can safely conclude that&nbsp;
Dina has no way out of there without external help&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:07.280
like i have mentioned in our saw 6 video being&nbsp;
chained on both hands and feet is an incredibly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:13.680
powerful immobilisation however it is true that&nbsp;
when she moves the trap weirdly wobbles along with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.120
her giving the impression that she might be able&nbsp;
to break the trap with enough forceful movements&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:24.720
but that's quite a leap of faith so let's&nbsp;
forget about her for now and focus on the device&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.000
our two remaining characters are chained onto&nbsp;
unfortunately it looks like the leather straps&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.280
on their wrists don't allow them enough space to&nbsp;
have them being cut through by the saws themselves&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.600
we can also see that they are wearing something&nbsp;
like leather belt chains on each side of their hip&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.560
connecting them to the device on both sides&nbsp;
not allowing them to either dodge the saws&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.320
by moving to the sides nor would it allow them&nbsp;
to back off and dodge it with a nice fade away&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.440
interestingly enough those side chains are only&nbsp;
attached to the overall they're wearing meaning&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.560
if you can find a way out of the overall you can&nbsp;
escape the restricting nature of those chains&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.480
to get out of the overall you could for instance&nbsp;
attempt to cut through the links on the front of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:14.080
the overall with the saw and then push your body&nbsp;
up like you would on a dip bar that way the chains&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.600
attaching the device to the overall would pull&nbsp;
the overall down themselves however to make this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:25.840
work you need the help of your opponent which in&nbsp;
this case doesn't look like a possibility so let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:31.120
move on and see what else we have here in the&nbsp;
first frames of this trap for instance we can see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:37.120
that none of the two guys have any chains on&nbsp;
their feet which is a huge advantage so what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:43.120
i would do first is to try and pull out any of&nbsp;
the cables underneath the device with my feet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.760
as you can see there is enough space to reach&nbsp;
through with your legs and that way you have a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.360
good chance of interrupting the electric circuit&nbsp;
and stop any of the saws from rotating but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.720
whatever we can come up with here everything&nbsp;
is connected to a big if so i truly believe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:04.960
the most reliable tactic to save all three victims&nbsp;
here is to cause a power outage for the whole area&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:10.320
since we have countless spectators watching we&nbsp;
have many people able to react and contact the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:16.080
right people in time to cause something like this&nbsp;
to happen what i mean is electricity is typically&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:21.440
distributed by distribution transformers to&nbsp;
distribute transformed electricity to households&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:27.120
and small businesses alike you may have seen them&nbsp;
around your neighbourhood now for the sake of this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.600
video i have contacted a good friend&nbsp;
of mine who is an actual electrician&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:37.520
to ask him for advice if it would be possible to&nbsp;
cause an actual outage through manipulation of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:44.000
such distribution transformers and it turns out&nbsp;
it really is however in any way it is not simple&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.440
and it does require some knowledge and access&nbsp;
as well i reckon that might not be the easiest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:55.040
way to save all the victims here but it still is&nbsp;
the most reliable way that we can come up with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:04.240
trap number two sticky sticky skin as much as&nbsp;
i enjoy seeing Chester again he is definitely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:09.520
in a complicated situation here i'm going to be&nbsp;
straightforward with you i really didn't find&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:15.280
anything useful here just tiny bits but i don't&nbsp;
think it's enough to beat this trap so if you have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:21.040
any idea on how to beat this trap in particular&nbsp;
please consider leaving a comment down below hello&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:27.680
heaven i want to play a game however if i had to&nbsp;
at least attempt to get out of there alive then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:33.200
perhaps freeing my arms would be the smartest&nbsp;
idea to begin with once your arms are free try&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:38.880
to activate the seat back adjuster usually on&nbsp;
the side of each car seat that way you can get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:44.560
at least a little bit closer to the lever you have&nbsp;
to pull now even if you get closer to the lever i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:50.480
think it is still too far away to actually be able&nbsp;
to pull it even if you try to stretch out your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:55.440
legs through the windshield i just think there&nbsp;
is not enough space for you to do that but since&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:01.040
Chester here is not wearing chains on his legs and&nbsp;
we have freed our arms already we might be able&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:06.560
to take off our pants and throw them around the&nbsp;
lever honestly it could work but it is attached&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:11.600
to a big if again so again if you have a better&nbsp;
idea let me know i'm burning for this one honestly

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:21.280
moving on to chapter two bobby's trial test number&nbsp;
one now in this series of tests we follow bobby&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:26.640
now i don't know what's up with this guy but&nbsp;
faking to be a jigsaw victim in the very city&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:32.000
where jigsaw is still hunting people just in&nbsp;
order to make some money is probably not the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.680
smartest idea if you want to pull this up&nbsp;
you do it low key at least have an alias&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:42.800
don't show your face or whatever if that&nbsp;
can't be done then you just must realize&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:50.080
that you are literally putting the red dot onto&nbsp;
yourself thanks for the signature nice picture&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:56.800
but hey one man's fortune is another man's misery&nbsp;
so thank you very much bobby let's analyze your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:02.480
traps now i will refrain from highlighting&nbsp;
the first trap the hanging cave trap as he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:08.240
avoided it successfully by swinging over to&nbsp;
the safe side but truth be told the spikes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:13.840
on the floor had enough space between them to be&nbsp;
able to safely land without facing a real threat&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:21.200
let's move on to this poor lady here in this trap&nbsp;
Nina is strapped onto a chair with a straight&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:26.640
jacket just the thought of wearing a straight&nbsp;
jacket always freaks me out now imagine four&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:32.240
metal posts threatening to pierce your throat&nbsp;
additionally gruesome but that's why we love&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:38.160
the saw franchise right now the key to release&nbsp;
the trap is stuck in her tummy but attached on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:44.960
a thin thread allowing bobby to pull it out i&nbsp;
wonder what came first David Blaine or this trap&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:51.120
but anyway additionally we get to know that the&nbsp;
louder the noise in this room the faster she gets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:56.960
pierced by the machinery so screaming here is&nbsp;
a big no-no however she doesn't seem to be able&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:02.960
to shut up can't really blame her though so how&nbsp;
would i beat the strap well the posts are moved&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:08.640
mechanically which is always a great thing because&nbsp;
it often allows the possibility of manipulation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:15.200
what i mean is the posts are moved by rotating&nbsp;
beaver gears so if you can stop those skiers from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:19.920
functioning properly you can stop the posts&nbsp;
from closing in how would i block the gears&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:26.240
just twist a piece of fabric and clamp it in&nbsp;
between the gears of course if you find a metal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:31.760
plate or anything else that is wide enough and&nbsp;
stable and comparably soft that would do it too&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:37.440
but as always since you're attempting to beat&nbsp;
those traps while hopefully wearing clothes you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:42.960
may as well use what you wear generally speaking&nbsp;
though i would say if you can't find alternatives&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:48.080
within these chambers then spare your clothes for&nbsp;
the next traps you don't know what's coming next&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:54.240
trap number three the human wheel now what&nbsp;
is it with those throat traps in this movie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:59.440
anyway this trap too involves Bevel gears&nbsp;
so blocking them would suffice here as well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:05.600
to stop the wheel from spinning and therefore&nbsp;
save Susanna a generous amount of pain there are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:11.280
other ideas though how you might be able to save&nbsp;
her for instance bobby has to push up a lever to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:16.880
close an electric circuit that stops the wheel&nbsp;
from spinning so if you can block the lever in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:22.400
a way that it stays up there that would also stop&nbsp;
the mechanism from moving if you are proficient in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:27.520
electrical engineering then you might find&nbsp;
another way to bridge the circuit if you do please&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:33.040
enlighten us in the comment section down below&nbsp;
get it enlighten us bridge the circuit anyone

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:40.160
trap number four test of courage this trap&nbsp;
is a bit more fun to solve than the previous&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:45.840
one although time might be a little scarce here&nbsp;
bobby as well as kale need to work together in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:52.080
order to save kale from getting hanged basically&nbsp;
to save kale bobby needs to secure the key hanging&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:57.440
from the ceiling in the middle of the boardwalk&nbsp;
since kale is blindfolded it is very risky for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:03.120
him to walk across even if they work together&nbsp;
in complete harmony which they definitely don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:08.160
finding balance while being blindfolded is a very&nbsp;
difficult task and the threat that if you miss&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:14.400
step you will fall into death is also not very&nbsp;
encouraging here if kale must walk over the board&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:19.920
though i would advise him to take off his shoes&nbsp;
and cross bare foot you are much more sensitive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:25.440
that way allowing you to really focus on where&nbsp;
you step this would translate not just into a more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:31.280
secure crossing but also faster movement however&nbsp;
in my humble opinion bobby should have taken the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:36.880
sole risk here i mean he's almost slower than kale&nbsp;
and crossing the boards we can see that partly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:42.000
on his journey across there is a metal grid where&nbsp;
he could literally grab onto which he doesn't use

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:49.920
also when he almost falls and jumps over to&nbsp;
the crossing we can see that it isn't really&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:54.640
far away i mean if your friend is about to get&nbsp;
killed you might as well take a little bit more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:54.640 --> 00:10:00.800
of risk that was just pathetic in my opinion so&nbsp;
the best way to beat this trap well next to bobby&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:06.640
moving a bit quicker i would say once bobby has&nbsp;
secured the key kale should have pulled his shirt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:11.520
in a way that causes it to resemble a pool&nbsp;
into which bobby could have thrown the key&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:16.560
catching a key blindfolded in this situation&nbsp;
is pure luck and i wouldn't recommend it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:22.400
while it is still risky to throw this tiny key in&nbsp;
anyway throwing it into a relatively large shirt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:28.240
pool is more likely to succeed even if the time&nbsp;
ran out and kale would get hanged up on his neck&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:33.360
it would take a few minutes at least until he&nbsp;
would lose his consciousness in fact hanging&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:38.240
someone doesn't kill that person immediately&nbsp;
unless the string is attached in a way that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:43.680
would break that person's neck and since kale's&nbsp;
hands are free as well he is free to pull himself&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:49.280
up on a string which would cause a time delay that&nbsp;
could be used to unlock his collar if time ran out

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:58.400
chapter number 5 or trap number 5 wisdom&nbsp;
tooth wisdom is tooth i didn't like this one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:02.880
the last wisdom tooth i pulled was&nbsp;
literally without sufficient anaesthesia&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:08.080
it was quite unpleasant i can tell you that&nbsp;
but i must say it isn't as terrible as some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:14.000
of the other traps people had to go through in the&nbsp;
saw series but still you want to generally avoid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.360
pulling your teeth on yourself without any&nbsp;
narcotics that is unless you are Robinson Cruzo&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:25.360
anyways i wonder if i could do it if i were in his&nbsp;
position to be honest i mean could you do it even&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:30.560
if your loft one's life is on the line some of&nbsp;
the traps in the past few movies of the franchise&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:35.120
would have been simply impossible to endure for&nbsp;
me even to save someone i love pulling two of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:40.240
your teeth is almost a catwalk in comparison and&nbsp;
if you can pull your own wisdom teeth at the same&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:45.360
time then well great you just saved yourself a&nbsp;
few hundred bucks but let's get into this first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:49.760
although beating this trap is not possible without&nbsp;
a stretch of imagination i can tell you that much&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:56.000
so since there isn't a mirror available there is&nbsp;
no way bobby could somehow glimpse at the numbers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:02.240
engraved on his teeth so there are only two ways&nbsp;
here either make it out by touch good luck with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:09.280
that or guess the correct code well let's roll the&nbsp;
numbers for a second bobby needs a four digit code&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:14.800
that gives the possibility of ten thousand&nbsp;
combinations including four times zero the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:21.280
code to unlock the door is five six nine&nbsp;
three if he were to go step by step with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:27.520
zero zero zero one zero zero zero two zero zero&nbsp;
zero three and so on it would take quite some time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:33.280
to arrive at the right combination if typing in a&nbsp;
four digit code plus the subsequent waiting time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:42.000
is about five seconds long he would precisely need&nbsp;
twenty eight thousand 465 seconds or around 474&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:48.240
minutes to arrive at the right combination at this&nbsp;
point though he only had roughly 19 minutes left&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:53.600
leaves only figuring out the codes by touch&nbsp;
which is incredibly difficult especially since&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:59.760
the inside of your mouth is moist and relatively&nbsp;
warm so feeling fine details in that environment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:04.560
is pretty difficult if you had a needle or&nbsp;
toothpick would it make it easier since you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:09.360
could follow the fine lines with it maybe&nbsp;
with all of that stated you may can come up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:14.400
with a different tactic to solve this trap if&nbsp;
you can as always consider leaving a comment

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:22.400
in this final test bobby has to overcome what&nbsp;
he claimed he had already overcome before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:26.960
which we all know from the start was a&nbsp;
lie i guess he visualized this scenario&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:31.600
so hard for the sake of his book there&nbsp;
was no way it wouldn't happen okay guys&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:35.200
i know that jigsaw mentions here&nbsp;
that bobby must pierce his chest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:40.720
pull himself up and reconnect the cables but&nbsp;
perhaps we can do it differently obviously it is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:46.000
possible as we can see in the movie bobby does&nbsp;
so relentlessly to my surprise it's a shame he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:52.000
failed so close to success but then again we don't&nbsp;
watch the saw movies for their happy endings do we

00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:58.320
so technically speaking if you&nbsp;
can get up there differently&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:03.600
you wouldn't need to pierce your pectoralis i&nbsp;
know that is strictly forbidden by jigsaw himself&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:07.840
but let's have a little fun here alright&nbsp;
you will screw me anyways in the comments so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:13.040
here is my uncreative idea step onto the&nbsp;
hooks like you would step into stirrups&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:18.720
twist your arms around the respective chains for&nbsp;
extra stability and pull yourself up on the third&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:24.400
chain to get to the cables above up there you just&nbsp;
connect the cables et voila that is french four&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:29.840
you're good to go and your wifey doesn't&nbsp;
need to burn to death in front of you amazing
