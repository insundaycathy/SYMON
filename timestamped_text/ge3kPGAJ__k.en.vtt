00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:05.040
You've just been invited to play a once in a&nbsp;
lifetime game where every dare can make you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.360
rich overnight. But if you had to do the most&nbsp;
suave and terrifying things to win a quarter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.560
million dollars, what would you do? This game&nbsp;
escalates the most futile dares imaginable. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:19.440
however far you think it's going to go, it goes&nbsp;
much, much further. I'm going to break down the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:24.000
mistakes made, what you should do, and how to&nbsp;
beat the game and get rich in Cheap Thrills.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.120
Craig here, is going to lose everything. He&nbsp;
finds an eviction notice on his front door,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:37.040
warning him that he needs to pay $4,500 in seven&nbsp;
days, or else he'll be kicked out. He goes to work&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.680
and gets called into his boss' office, finding&nbsp;
out that he's just been fired. He's got no way to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.160
support his family or pay his rent, and they'll&nbsp;
be homeless if he doesn't find something fast.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.480
He goes to a bar to drown his sorrows and runs&nbsp;
it to his old friend, Vince, from high school.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.560
He buys him a drink, but Craig here, notices&nbsp;
bruises on the man's knuckles and learns his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:59.120
friend has become a professional debt collector.&nbsp;
Vince tells him he's had to do terrible things for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.520
the job and that Craig would never be capable of&nbsp;
it. But they're both about to find out that Craig&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.560
here, is willing to go so far over the line that&nbsp;
you won't even recognize him by the end. They're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.560
invited to drink with this couple, Colin and&nbsp;
violet, to celebrate the woman's birthday.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.280
And the man tells him he wants to make a friendly&nbsp;
bet. Colin here, pours two glasses of tequila and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.600
turns the rest of their night into a game. The&nbsp;
first person to drink their shot will win $50.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.240
Without hesitation, Vince here, grabs his&nbsp;
glass and drinks it, winning the bet before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:32.560
his friend even realizes what's going on. Vince&nbsp;
has won $50 and this seems like an innocent game,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.240
but this is only the beginning&nbsp;
of a truly horrifying situation.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.840
This will get so twisted that eating your&nbsp;
own severe finger is not even the worst&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.160
thing they'll consider doing by the end of the&nbsp;
night. Now, this might not be a death game yet,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.080
but for a man who's lost his job and about&nbsp;
to lose his home, he should definitely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.640
be looking at this like it's a survival&nbsp;
scenario. Because if he doesn't earn $4,500&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.920
in seven days, his life as he knows it is over.&nbsp;
So if someone offers me a free shot for $50,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.440
I would slam it down faster than&nbsp;
you could say drinking problem.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.720
$50 is several days of groceries, or a month&nbsp;
worth of diapers for his son. And an opportunity&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:12.160
like this shouldn't be passed up. This couple&nbsp;
is obviously loaded, because this is a $300&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.240
bottle of tequila, and he bought it on a&nbsp;
whim. He's also throwing money at us for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.880
his own entertainment. So we should immediately be&nbsp;
asking ourselves how much they're willing to spend&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.520
and how far they're willing to go, because we&nbsp;
could make a lot of money before the night ends.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.600
I would ask the man to give me something else to&nbsp;
do, because if drinking a free shot of tequila is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.920
worth 50, there's a world of other things I'd&nbsp;
be willing to do with alcohol in my system,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.560
and for a whole lot more. Colin here, hands&nbsp;
over the 50 bucks as promised. But when the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.320
debt collector gives it to his friend, the&nbsp;
rich guy insists, he played by the rules and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.320
keep the money he won. Vince takes it&nbsp;
back and they move on to the next bet.

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.400
Vince here, seems like a nice guy, but he's&nbsp;
going to get so jealous of how much money Craig&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.120
will make tonight that it's going to drive him&nbsp;
insane. They all start playing darts and the rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.080
guy offers $50 if they can hit the face on the&nbsp;
bill. Vince here, narrowly misses the targets,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.760
but the rich guy quickly escalates the&nbsp;
game. Neighing towards a woman at the bar,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:09.120
he makes another bet, offering $200 to&nbsp;
anyone who gets her so angry she slaps them.

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.200
Craig here, isn't sure if it's worth the risk,&nbsp;
but his friend convinces him it's too much money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:18.560
to pass up. And he approached the bar to give&nbsp;
it a shot. Okay. We all want to see Craig here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.800
get slapped in the face. The game is starting&nbsp;
to involve other people. And that makes things&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.600
a little more complicated, but I would definitely&nbsp;
take this bet. Because if my family is going to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:32.320
evicted and out on the streets in seven days&nbsp;
time, I'd do just about anything for $200.

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.800
That's enough to pay for a month of car&nbsp;
insurance. And when you're broke with no job,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:42.400
$200 for a slap is a no-brainer. Now, this woman&nbsp;
doesn't know if Craig here might be violent,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.080
and she doesn't have any friends to help&nbsp;
defend her. Under these circumstances,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.080
slapping a man in the face is a dangerous&nbsp;
risk for any woman to take, because most&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.720
people avoid confrontation at all costs. And&nbsp;
that makes it harder for you to win the bet.

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.360
The obvious solution is to tell her about the game&nbsp;
and offering to pay for her drink in exchange for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:04.240
a convincing slap. It's a win-win. We all need&nbsp;
to vent out a bit of anger once in a while. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:08.480
as long as we're letting this stranger know she's&nbsp;
safe and everyone gets entertained in the process,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.800
I'm happy to see her get some healthy release. But&nbsp;
with how messed up each of these characters are,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.000
and the way the rest of this night&nbsp;
is only going to get worse and worse,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.200
we can go one step further to&nbsp;
take care of our mental health.

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.040
Craig here, walks up to the woman.&nbsp;
But when she turns to face him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:35.120
the man chickens out and walks back to the&nbsp;
group. His friend decides to show them all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:39.280
how it's done. And it only takes seconds before&nbsp;
the woman smacks him right across the face.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:46.240
Vince now has $250 and Craig still has&nbsp;
zero. He walks back with a huge grin and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.320
the man congratulates him by cutting a few&nbsp;
lines of nose candy in front of everyone.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:54.080
The bartender catches them in the act and&nbsp;
tells them that he's not allowed to do this.

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:58.560
But when he offers her $400, she has&nbsp;
a change of heart and takes the bribe.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:02.000
The man has been here for less than&nbsp;
30 minutes and has already spent over&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.160
a $1,000. And that's nothing compared to&nbsp;
what he's going to be offering them later,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:11.120
because this guy has 250 grand in a safe at home.&nbsp;
And it's going to get downward disgusting by the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:15.360
time that money comes out. They move the party&nbsp;
to a strip club where the guys are looking to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:19.440
escalate the game. But the rich man starts&nbsp;
complaining about the no touching policy.

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:24.560
That's when he offers $200 to the first man&nbsp;
who slaps his stripper on the butt. Craig here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:28.480
thinks it's going too far, but his friend jumps&nbsp;
up to the challenge and heads across the club.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:32.080
Okay. This game is starting to&nbsp;
cross some ethical boundaries.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:34.880
And that means it's escalating&nbsp;
further outside of your control,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:39.440
and requires you to put more at risk in order to&nbsp;
earn the money. All strip clubs have bouncers,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:44.080
and there's no way that slapping this girl in the&nbsp;
flapjacks won't get you beaten up and tossed out.

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:46.720
Now, I'll never condone touching&nbsp;
a woman without her consent,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:51.280
because it's flat out wrong. But if you asked&nbsp;
me to choose between my family starving or this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:55.280
I'm going to have to think twice about the&nbsp;
opportunity that's being offered here. To me,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:59.840
the only way to win is to rig the game and get&nbsp;
this woman's consent without letting anyone know.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:04.560
Being a stripper is not an easy job,&nbsp;
earning roughly $190 a day on average,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:08.800
but can frequently make as little as&nbsp;
$20 for the entire evening if it's slow.

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:12.960
With this in mind, I would approach the stripper&nbsp;
and respectfully tell her about the situation,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:17.360
how much money is at stake, and if she would&nbsp;
like to participate to earn 50% of the bet. If&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:22.000
you asked me whether I wanted to make a $100&nbsp;
giving a stranger a lap dance for 10 minutes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.760
or making the same amount of money in one&nbsp;
second with a gentle slap on the booty,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:30.320
I'd take the latter. If she agrees, then I'll ask&nbsp;
her to look upset, but to not call the bouncers.

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:33.520
And that way, I can make sure I can stay in&nbsp;
the club long enough to give her the money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:38.240
she's earned. Making sure that his friends can&nbsp;
see him, Vince here, spanks the stripper hard.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:45.040
Vince has now earned a $450 and Craig,&nbsp;
the party pooper, still has zero.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:49.280
They all leave the club quickly before they get&nbsp;
in trouble and climb into the rich man's car.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:54.000
But it's getting too much for Craig here, and he&nbsp;
insists he needs to get back home to his wife.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000
Suddenly, a bouncer storms out of the club&nbsp;
and confronts the man, accusing him of hitting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.160
one of the dancers. He tells him he didn't do&nbsp;
it, but that's when the rich man shouts out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:07.360
that he'll give him $500 if he hits him first. And&nbsp;
Craig looks at the bouncer to consider the offer.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:12.000
Okay. Right now, $500 is a lot of&nbsp;
money. That's more than one month&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.560
of groceries for the average American family.&nbsp;
But this bet has a lot more to consider here.

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:21.040
If you punch a bouncer, you're guaranteed to get&nbsp;
knocked the (beep) out. And this is going to cost&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:26.880
you a lot of money. First of all, this man is&nbsp;
wearing glasses, which costs an average of $196.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:32.080
And a punch in the face will definitely break both&nbsp;
your glasses and possibly, even your nose. Without&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:37.920
health insurance, a broken nose requires an X-ray,&nbsp;
a facility fee, and a doctor fee for roughly $500&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:43.920
total. With one swing, you could win $500&nbsp;
and lose $696 in the blink of an eye.

00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:48.800
Now, with all that said, I would still take the&nbsp;
bet, but with one modification. This man has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:53.200
already had at least two shots and three beers,&nbsp;
which will definitely slow his response time.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:57.680
And he might not even be fast enough to land a&nbsp;
punch, let alone dodge one. That's why I would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:03.280
try to win the $500 by kicking this bouncer in&nbsp;
the balls. It will technically qualify as hitting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:08.080
him first. And this would make him flinch in pain&nbsp;
long enough for me to run back to the car safely.

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:11.840
It's definitely a cheap shot, but we're never&nbsp;
coming back to this club. There's a getaway&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:15.760
vehicle 15 feet away, and this bouncer is&nbsp;
blaming you for something you didn't do.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:19.760
So it's the best and only way out of this&nbsp;
situation. Craig here, goes for the gold&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:26.480
and decides to hit the bouncer in the face. With&nbsp;
one bet, Craig has earned $500 and that's nothing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:30.400
compared to what he'll make by the end of the&nbsp;
night. He's surprised with himself and looks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:34.800
back to his friends. But as soon as he does, the&nbsp;
bouncer knocks him out cold with a single punch.

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:40.400
Okay. Now, before we get any further, this&nbsp;
guy just took a serious beating. And because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:45.280
YouTube won't let us show any blood, we have to&nbsp;
blow the next scenes. But trust me, by the end&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:50.560
of the video, they're going to be doing bets that&nbsp;
are so insane, you'll be glad that we blurred it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:54.720
Later that night, Craig here, wakes up on&nbsp;
someone else's couch and checks his pockets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:59.360
to find a missed call from his wife, as well&nbsp;
as $500 he won from the fight with the bouncer.

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:03.120
Walking into another room, he finds out they're&nbsp;
in the rich man's house and they're all glad to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:07.360
see he's awake so they could continue playing&nbsp;
the game. But all he wants to do is go home.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:10.160
The rich man insists he takes&nbsp;
some painkillers before leaving,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:14.320
and Craig agrees to wait for the medicine. Colin&nbsp;
and Vince here, go into the study where the rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:18.800
man opens a safe. And the debt collector is&nbsp;
shocked when he sees bundles of cash inside.

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:23.520
Realizing he's just hit the jackpot, he sits back&nbsp;
and starts to come up with a plan to rob this rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:28.640
couple blind. In the living room, the wife gently&nbsp;
cleans the mud off of Craig's face and asks him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:33.360
if he's ever broken any bones. He tells her he&nbsp;
broke his foot once, flying off a skateboard. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:38.160
it reminds her she once saw a skateboarder get&nbsp;
hit by a car, and that the kid's breaking bones&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:44.480
sounded like a snapping tree branch. Okay. This&nbsp;
woman has psychopath written all over her face.

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:48.560
All night long, this woman has looked bored&nbsp;
and expresses no emotion. But when she tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:54.080
a story of a boy getting hit by a car, it&nbsp;
makes her smile. This is a major red flag.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:57.600
Now, it's important to remember that&nbsp;
this entire night is to celebrate her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:01.680
birthday. And that means everything that's&nbsp;
happening is a show for her entertainment.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:06.000
If she's a psychopath that always smiles&nbsp;
at death and we are her birthday present,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.400
that turns our situation from financial&nbsp;
survival into a life or death scenario.

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:12.400
And it forces us to look at this whole game&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:16.480
a lot differently. I would start to consider&nbsp;
how much freedom we actually have here.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:20.960
Every time Craig tried to leave, they wouldn't&nbsp;
let him, and keep manipulating him to stay.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:25.440
These guys could be serial killers for all we&nbsp;
know, and earning a few $1,000 means nothing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:29.680
if you aren't alive long enough to spend it.&nbsp;
These kinds of people lack empathy for others,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:34.000
so we need to exploit that. She wants to&nbsp;
see the most (beep) up things imaginable.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.440
I would try striking a deal, offering&nbsp;
to sell out my friend Vince here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:42.080
and make her night. If we promise to push him in&nbsp;
these bets until he reaches his breaking point,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:45.920
I would only ask that they let me leave&nbsp;
unharmed with half the money in return.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:50.320
She will logically conclude that this is a good&nbsp;
deal that fulfills her desires, and it gives you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:54.480
the best chance to survive and win money. It&nbsp;
might be cruel, but getting rich and staying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:59.360
alive are much higher on my priorities than&nbsp;
keeping a friend I haven't seen in five years.

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:03.840
The guy comes back in and gives Craig here, a&nbsp;
handful of pills, as the rich man asked them all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:08.400
to follow him outside. He leads them to the patio&nbsp;
to show them the view and tells them a story about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:13.200
how his wife designed the house. But it's all just&nbsp;
a distraction as Craig here, suddenly realizes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:18.320
that Vince has taken another bet. He looks down&nbsp;
to find his friend is peeing all over his shoes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:25.680
Vince has now earned $750 and Craig here,&nbsp;
is seriously pissed off about all this.

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:29.520
Furious, he goes back inside the house to&nbsp;
wash off the stains and Vince follows him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:31.840
trying to calm him down, because he's got a plan.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:35.680
He's going to rob the couple and needs Craig's&nbsp;
help to do it. But the man refused to help,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:39.920
pointing out that the guy will call the cops.&nbsp;
Vince here, is certain that will never happen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:44.400
because the police will see this guy is coked out&nbsp;
of his mind and arrest everyone. And realizing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:48.080
this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,&nbsp;
he agrees to help him steal the cash.

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:53.360
Okay. This is a great idea, and I would&nbsp;
definitely consider this if I was in his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:57.920
position. This guy is coked out of his mind,&nbsp;
extremely trusting. And most importantly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:03.040
he did not enter any numbers into the safe. It&nbsp;
was already open when he walked in. This makes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:06.400
him a prime candidate to steal from.&nbsp;
But there's one vital clue here that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:09.680
tells us that this could go horribly&nbsp;
wrong if it's not done the right way.

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:14.080
If you're robbing a house, the most basic thing&nbsp;
you need to do is to survey the entire place,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:18.640
to get an idea of where the exits are and what&nbsp;
kind of security system they might have. If he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:22.560
had taken a moment to study his environment,&nbsp;
he would have realized that this guy is not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:26.000
someone they want to mess with, because&nbsp;
he's an award-winning martial artist and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.160
could easily kick their asses. The best&nbsp;
way to do this is with a distraction.

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:33.920
I would tell my debt collector friend here,&nbsp;
to entertain the couple while I sneak into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:37.840
the office and take as much money as&nbsp;
I can carry, and look for a backdoor.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:41.680
Leaving your friend here is the only solution,&nbsp;
because it keeps the couple's attention long&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:44.880
enough for you to escape. And your friend&nbsp;
won't come looking for you because he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:48.800
thinks you're still helping him. These two&nbsp;
haven't seen each other in over five years,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:51.760
so it was not a friendship they&nbsp;
were interested in keeping anyways.

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:56.080
And that makes them someone I'd be willing to&nbsp;
throw under the bus and escape the situation with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:56.080 --> 00:14:00.240
a (beep) load of money before this betting game&nbsp;
gets out of hand and takes a deadly turn. He might&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:04.560
come looking for me, but we're already going to&nbsp;
be evicted, so I can use this money to relocate my&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:08.800
family. And we'll never see him again. They leave&nbsp;
the bathroom and tell the couple, they've kissed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:13.680
and made up. But when the rich man approaches to&nbsp;
hand him $300, he shoves him against the wall.

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:17.360
Putting a knife to the guy's throat, he&nbsp;
demands to know what the safe's combination is,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:21.600
and the guy tells him it's not even locked.&nbsp;
Craig runs into the office and shoves the money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:26.080
into cardboard boxes as quickly as he can. The&nbsp;
friend of demands they hand over the car keys,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:29.040
but suddenly the man grabs his&nbsp;
wrist and knocks him to the ground,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:33.760
as his wife pulls out a gun and points it at&nbsp;
Craig. That's when things take a strange turn,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:37.920
because instead of calling the cops, he tells&nbsp;
him to pretend that none of this ever happened.

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:42.160
This whole thing was organized for his wife's&nbsp;
birthday. And that's when he admits that all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:46.320
this cash was already set aside for them to&nbsp;
play the game and do crazy, messed up things,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:50.960
but only if they obey every command to earn it.&nbsp;
They both decided to keep playing, and the rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:54.800
man tells them their next dare: whoever can&nbsp;
hold their breath the longest, gets $500.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:58.640
Suddenly, Craig here, gets a call&nbsp;
from his wife and he answers it to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:01.280
find out that it's 2:00 AM and she's worried sick.

00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:06.000
She knows he's been fired and begs him to come&nbsp;
back home. But the rich man offers him $300&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:12.800
to hang up on his wife. Okay. This is the easiest&nbsp;
$300 he's going to make all night. And I would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:17.680
hang up on my wife faster than you can say custody&nbsp;
battle, but it's such a great offer that it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:23.360
distracting us from a serious red flag here. So&nbsp;
far, there's been a reasonable proportion for each&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:29.360
bet, where drinking a shot of tequila is worth $50&nbsp;
and punching a bouncer in the face is worth $500.

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:32.400
But there's no reason that&nbsp;
hanging up the phone is worth $300&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:37.520
as a form of entertainment. It just doesn't&nbsp;
make sense. And that's why it's a red flag.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:41.920
He's offering way too much money for this because&nbsp;
he doesn't want us contacting the outside world&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:46.160
to tell anyone where we are, or what's going&nbsp;
on. That tells us he wants this game to get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:51.120
really twisted and is trying to control the flow&nbsp;
of information. Our lives are clearly in danger.

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:55.440
But if we leave, we miss out on a&nbsp;
once-in-a-lifetime chance to earn more money in a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:55.440 --> 00:16:00.880
single night than I can make in over five years on&nbsp;
an average salary. I would stick around as long as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:05.360
they kept giving me money. But instead of hanging&nbsp;
up on my wife, I would tell them that I did and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:10.880
make $300, but keep the call going with the phone&nbsp;
inside my pocket. The wife will be confused,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:15.040
but she'll be able to listen in and figure&nbsp;
out what's going on while I drop her hints.

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:17.920
That way, I can make sure every&nbsp;
word of the night was recorded,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:22.080
in case things take a serious turn and we need&nbsp;
a witness or someone who knows our location,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:27.520
in case we need help in a life or death emergency.&nbsp;
Craig here, hangs up on his wife, winning $300.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:33.760
Craig has now earned $800 total, which puts&nbsp;
him back in the lead. And he's finally ready&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:38.080
to start taking this game seriously. Vince&nbsp;
already started playing for the next bet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:43.040
and now, it's Craig's turn. If he can hold his&nbsp;
breath longer than Vince did, he will win $500.

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:48.000
Afraid of losing, Vince here, punches him in&nbsp;
the stomach just seconds before he was about to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.480
beat his record. Colin here, lets it go since&nbsp;
he didn't lay down any rules. But Craig here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:58.000
wants to get revenge and wants to know what&nbsp;
the next bet is. Vince has stolen this guy's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.400
chance to win money he desperately needs to&nbsp;
keep his family off the streets. Craig here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:06.960
could have easily won this bet. He's the only&nbsp;
person in the room that hasn't been doing drugs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:11.840
all night. And that's a huge advantage, because&nbsp;
coke dramatically increases your heart rate.

00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:15.600
If the heart is pumping faster, then it's&nbsp;
converting more of your blood oxygen into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:19.520
carbon dioxide, making it a lot harder to&nbsp;
hold your breath. But Craig made a huge&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:24.560
mistake here by not realizing that this bet is&nbsp;
the first competitive winner-take-all challenge.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:28.880
And if you already know your friend is a debt&nbsp;
collector, who's a professional at taking money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:33.280
away from others, you have to assume he's going&nbsp;
to find every possible way to take your money.

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:36.000
There's only one way to win&nbsp;
these bets from this point on,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.080
and we need to start looking for every&nbsp;
opportunity to screw this guy over and cheat.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:45.520
For $500, we're not interested in honesty and&nbsp;
sportsmanship. We're interested in winning at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:50.240
all cost. The rich man leads them outside&nbsp;
and shows them a turd in front of his house.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:54.800
His neighbor's dog is always pooping on his&nbsp;
lawn and he wants revenge. The first man who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:59.680
takes a dump inside the neighbor's house with&nbsp;
a photo to prove they did it, will win $1,200.

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:04.480
Without hesitation, they run to break into the&nbsp;
building and squat down on the floor to perform&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:08.160
their duty. He finishes his business&nbsp;
and stands up to take a picture of it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:11.120
before yelling good luck to his&nbsp;
friend, as he runs out of the house.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:15.600
A girl wakes up and is shocked to find Vince with&nbsp;
his pants around his ankles. And he runs out of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:20.640
the house. But on his way back, he notices the&nbsp;
neighbor's dog and comes up with a horrible plan.

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:25.120
Vince here, walks in carrying the neighbor's dog&nbsp;
and offers to will it for money. But the rich man&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:31.040
is disgusted and won't have a helpless animal&nbsp;
grilled on his wife's birthday. Craig has now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:35.920
earned $2,000 total, but his friend&nbsp;
Vince, is already planning his revenge.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:40.400
For the next bet, the first person to make&nbsp;
the rich man a vodka tonic will get $300.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:44.560
Craig here, walks out of the kitchen, but&nbsp;
gets thrown to the floor by his friend.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:46.640
That's when things start to get out of control.

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:51.120
The wife comforts Craig, rubbing his shoulders,&nbsp;
and suddenly offers to sleep with him to help&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:55.200
him relax. He can't believe what he's hearing,&nbsp;
and tells them he won't cheat on his wife. But&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:55.200 --> 00:19:00.880
when the men offers him $4,500 and makes it&nbsp;
a bet, he starts to consider her proposal.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:06.400
Okay. This is taking generosity to a whole&nbsp;
new level. Less than half an hour ago,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:09.280
they were being robbed. And now,&nbsp;
they're turning the other cheek&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:14.400
in the kinkiest way possible. $4,500 is&nbsp;
going to save his family from eviction.

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:18.240
But if his wife ever finds out, he's&nbsp;
not going to have a family to save.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:22.720
Just by looking at how jealous Vince is of how&nbsp;
much money Craig is making, you can rely on him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:27.440
to make this situation much worse. I would expect&nbsp;
that if we survive the night, Vince will threaten&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:32.080
to tell the wife what happened and destroy his&nbsp;
marriage just out of spite. Now, there's another&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:36.400
angle here that could actually make this even&nbsp;
more dangerous. The rich man is doing everything&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:41.200
here for his wife's darkest desires, but that&nbsp;
doesn't necessarily mean he won't be jealous.

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:45.600
Statistically, one of the highest causes of&nbsp;
both manslaughter and premeditated murder&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:49.360
is because of adultery. And it's not&nbsp;
uncommon for a situation just like this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:54.000
turning violent very quickly. Going&nbsp;
through with this bet could win you $4,500,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.400
but it's not difficult to imagine that this guy&nbsp;
could come looking to murder you for revenge. For&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:03.600
me, this is one line that I wouldn't cross. And I&nbsp;
would wait for the next bet to keep making money.

00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:08.880
Craig here, can't resist the offer. And&nbsp;
with $4,500 on the line, he agrees. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:13.120
wife starts going at it as the other men watch.&nbsp;
And Vince here is completely shocked by what's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:17.280
happening. By the time it's all over, Craig is&nbsp;
exhausted from all the money he's just made.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:23.840
Now, he's earned $6,500 total, which is&nbsp;
enough to pay for four months of rent.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:27.280
The host excuses himself and change&nbsp;
out of his clothes, but Craig here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:32.160
has had enough. And taking his earnings, he walks&nbsp;
out of the front door, leaving his friend behind.

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:36.640
The couple return, and they're excited to make&nbsp;
even crazier bets. But when they notice that Craig&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:41.680
is missing, the woman begins to sulk. Greedy for&nbsp;
more money, Vince here insists they could continue&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:46.000
playing and wants to know what the next challenge&nbsp;
is. Noticing he's lost his wife's attention,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.400
Colin here, leads the man into the kitchen and&nbsp;
tells him to cut off his own pinky. Nervous,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:55.360
he asks how much it's worth and the rich&nbsp;
man slams $25,000 down on the cutting board.

00:20:55.360 --> 00:21:00.000
It's a huge payout and the man can't resist the&nbsp;
money being offered. He's about to go through with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:05.920
it, but that's when they hear Craig offered to&nbsp;
do it for $23,000. Furious, his friend tells him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:10.640
to leave. But the man has realized that after he&nbsp;
pays his three months of overdue rent, he'll only&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:15.920
have enough money for one more month. And has no&nbsp;
choice but to continue playing. Vince immediately&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:21.280
undercuts his friend, bidding $22,000 to pluck&nbsp;
his own finger scoff. And a bidding war starts.

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:24.880
But neither of them realize that this is&nbsp;
going to be nothing compared to what they'll&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:30.320
have to do next. Okay. Now, the stakes are&nbsp;
escalating out of control. If we keep playing,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:35.200
it will affect us permanently. And there's no&nbsp;
going back. This is a very dangerous progression,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:38.720
because if you show this couple that you're&nbsp;
willing to cut off your pinky, I guarantee&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:42.880
you they're going to ask themselves what else you&nbsp;
might be willing to cut off for their enjoyment.

00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:45.920
They hold all the power, and we can't&nbsp;
leave because we need to make as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:49.680
much money as possible. So the smartest&nbsp;
thing to do here is to broker leverage.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:53.600
I would try to convince my friend that&nbsp;
by refusing the bet and working together,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:57.680
we can gain bargaining power to force the couple&nbsp;
to find safer challenges and to drive up the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:02.080
prices in this night of twisted entertainment.&nbsp;
If we can't persuade them, then we have to move&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:07.040
to plan B, and consider if cutting off your&nbsp;
own pinky actually makes any financial sense.

00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:10.880
First of all, the pinky is a lot more&nbsp;
important for daily life than you may think.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:15.200
But finger plantation has a pretty low success&nbsp;
rate, because it involves joining tendons,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:20.400
bones, and reconnecting arteries. It also&nbsp;
costs over $10,000 and you wouldn't be able&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:25.680
to work for 120 days after the surgery.&nbsp;
So altogether, this is a terrible deal.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:31.360
Craig's final offer is $15,000. And Vince&nbsp;
finally decides it's not worth it. Craig&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:35.760
places his pinky on the table, but is shocked&nbsp;
to learn his friend is going to do the honors.

00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:39.760
Terrified, he tries to stall the bet, but&nbsp;
his friend is looking for revenge and chops&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:43.840
his pinky off without warning. Screaming&nbsp;
in vain, he runs to the couch weezing,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:48.000
and the rich man closes his moans shut,&nbsp;
congratulating him on his victory.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:55.840
Craig has now earned $21,500 total, and that's&nbsp;
half of your salary in a single night. He asked&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:55.840 --> 00:23:00.160
for his pinky ring, but that's when Colin hears a&nbsp;
gagging noise and starts looking for the source.

00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:04.160
Behind the bar, he's horrified to find that&nbsp;
the neighbor's dog has choked on Craig's pinky&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:09.200
ring and denied. The rich man picks up the dog,&nbsp;
taking the meat cleaver with him, and he better&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:14.240
not do what I think he's going to do. As they&nbsp;
wait, Vince threatens his friend for stealing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:18.880
his bet. But Craig argues, he needs the money&nbsp;
more than him because he has a family. Things&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:23.360
are getting heated. But soon, Colin here returns&nbsp;
to the living room and offers his guests dinner.

00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:26.800
They gather at the table. But when Vince&nbsp;
here lifts the cover, he's terrified by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:32.240
what's being served. The rich man has cooked up&nbsp;
the bread dog and offers $50,000 to the first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:37.280
person who finishes their portion. Okay.&nbsp;
Plucking off my pinky is already extreme,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:43.200
but grilling and cooking a hog is so far over the&nbsp;
line that even Satan would tell them to calm down.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:48.560
I'm not going to eat this innocent animal for any&nbsp;
amount of money. Colin here, points out 50 grand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:53.040
is more money than they'll make in a year, and&nbsp;
could solve so many of their financial problems.

00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:56.800
And it's enough to convince them both to&nbsp;
take the bet. Finishing their meals at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:56.800 --> 00:24:00.640
the exact same time, the rich man can't&nbsp;
figure out which one deserves to win.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:04.880
So his wife offers a tiebreaker. Handing&nbsp;
him the ice bucket with a finger inside,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:09.040
the man tells them that whoever eats Craig's&nbsp;
pinky, will be declared the winner of the bet.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:13.680
He throws it across the room and the men fight&nbsp;
over it. But Craig here, manages to rip it free.

00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:18.160
He brutally kicks Vince to make sure he stays&nbsp;
down and puts the severe finger in his mouth,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:20.720
chewing it up and swallowing it all the way down.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:28.720
Craig has now earned $71,500 and now, Vince is&nbsp;
going to make sure he regrets it. His friend&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:32.960
suddenly tackles him to the floor and&nbsp;
savagely beats his friend into a floody pulp.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:37.360
Shaken by what he's just done, the rich man&nbsp;
leads him outside and Vince here, complains&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:41.200
about how he was betrayed and is terrified&nbsp;
that he almost grilled his oldest friend.

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:47.440
But that's when the rich man comes up with an&nbsp;
idea. He offers $250,000 if Vince kills Craig,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:50.480
and reminds him that he'll get all&nbsp;
the money he needs for a new life.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:55.760
Okay. This is the final bet and we have a&nbsp;
tough decision to make here, because willing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:55.760 --> 00:25:00.400
friends in a death game is one thing, but filling&nbsp;
friends for cash is a whole new level of evil.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:06.240
Luckily for us, there's a way we could get the&nbsp;
$250,000 without having to will anyone. This&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:10.400
final challenge is everything they've been waiting&nbsp;
for, and that means their guard might be down.

00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:14.240
I would accept their bet to still my friend,&nbsp;
but tell them I'm not comfortable using a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:18.400
knife because it's too messy, and ask to use the&nbsp;
wife's gun for the job, because it's cleaner and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:22.960
less emotional. If they agree, this takes away&nbsp;
their best line of self-defense. And now, we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:28.880
have a ranged weapon to rob them of all $250,000.&nbsp;
After everything that's happened this night, they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:33.440
definitely won't call the police. And they'll have&nbsp;
no evidence of the robbery to prove what happened.

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:39.760
Now, Vince here, is definitely the biggest loser&nbsp;
of the night, with only $1,250. If I were him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:43.040
I'd leave my friend with the couple and&nbsp;
take the rest of the cash for myself, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:47.680
get out of there as quickly as possible, because&nbsp;
there's no honor among thieves. Inside the house,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:52.000
Craig here, asks for a cab back home, but&nbsp;
the wife suddenly turns on a projector,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:56.160
showing all the photos she's taken of the night.&nbsp;
The rich man tells him to go take the money he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:56.160 --> 00:26:00.800
won, while he waits for his taxi. But he doesn't&nbsp;
realize that Vince here is going in for the kill.

00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:04.480
That's when Vince catches glimpses of&nbsp;
the photos. And when he realizes that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:08.800
the whole night was setting him up for murder,&nbsp;
he has a change of heart. He tells his friend,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:13.680
they should both leave, never expecting Craig to&nbsp;
shoot him in the back. Turning around in shock,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:17.520
he realized that his friend was offered&nbsp;
the same deal and falls to the floor.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:21.600
Craig here, finishes him off with one more&nbsp;
shot and stands the lone winner of the game.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:28.320
Craig has earned all $250,000, which&nbsp;
is over five years of his salary.

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:32.880
Exhausted, he grabs a bag to put all his money&nbsp;
in and the couple thank him for the evening,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:38.000
as they watch him leave. Colin here, hands his&nbsp;
wife $50 for winning a private bet that Craig&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:43.040
would be the winner of their death game. This&nbsp;
whole night was just for a $50 bet on which of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:48.240
the two friends would go further. The man arrives&nbsp;
at his apartment complex and enters his unit,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:51.120
soaked in mud. Dumping his&nbsp;
winnings all over the couch,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:55.040
he goes to pick up his crying son and&nbsp;
that's when the lights suddenly turn on.

00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:58.000
His wife is both shocked and&nbsp;
angry to see him covered in mud,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:01.280
with bundles of stained cash he&nbsp;
dumped on the couch. All he can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:05.600
do is stand there as his baby screams. And&nbsp;
he realizes that even with all this money,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:10.720
his life still sucks. But what do you think?&nbsp;
How would you beat Cheap Thrills? Let me know&nbsp;&nbsp;
