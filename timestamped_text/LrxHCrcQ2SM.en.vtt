russell woodman it turns out kane used to work&nbsp;
with general and the agency found out about the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:14.960
site since they were monitoring kane's computer&nbsp;
then disease control expert dr allison reed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.080

they will take control from now onwards&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.640
later kane takes them to court and they&nbsp;
insist they want to be part of the research&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:33.280
since they discovered it alison reveals that when&nbsp;
kane worked with us army he created a vaccine&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:40.560
which had some side effects and it caused 140&nbsp;
000 army men to get stomachache constipation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.840

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.840
later that night they dress like officers&nbsp;
and they sneak into the meteor crash site&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:12.160
they see a scientist taking a big fly-like&nbsp;
creature in a sealed capsule they didn't see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.960
the site for two weeks and what used to be&nbsp;
worms and fungus has now evolved into small&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:23.760
unusual creatures then they were the suits those&nbsp;
scientists were wearing people from control rooms&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:30.320
see this and assume this is just the other team of&nbsp;
scientists they now see that the site is totally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:38.160
changed and now it harbors an alien forest with&nbsp;
animal life in it we see a monkey-sized centipede&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:43.520
then it gets eaten by something that looks like&nbsp;
a giant animal eating plant then they see a big&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:50.560
spider they soon get dr allison's attentions as&nbsp;
the professors try to get a small part of asteroid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:56.320
dr allison confronts them and asks them to&nbsp;
leave as they argue one giant mosquito goes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:03.120
inside harry's suit and then it gets into his&nbsp;
body then they take him to hospital and it's now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:08.880
moving in his body then they take some lubricant&nbsp;
and get the fly out of his wormhole which dies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:15.520
after been taken out in a party that night wayne&nbsp;
talks to his buddies about the firefighting exam&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:22.240
later the owner of the golf club goes near&nbsp;
water and he is attacked by an alien reptile&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:28.080
next day kane and harry go back to&nbsp;
college and we see harry walking in pain&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:33.040
wayne is waiting for them to show them&nbsp;
something he shows them the alien that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:37.840
killed the owner of golf club and tells them&nbsp;
the creature died after brought out of the water&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:44.000
in a house near the college a group of ladies&nbsp;
find a dog-like creature in their house&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:49.440
the creature then attacks the lady and soon&nbsp;
the creature chalks to death in our atmosphere&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:55.840
later kane meets allison and tells her that&nbsp;
the creatures are spreading crazily and that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:03.600
the creatures are adapting the environment he then&nbsp;
asks her out but she just smiles cane then meets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:09.840
harry who is having breakfast with wayne and they&nbsp;
hear about an animal attack on the radio they go&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:15.920
there and they see officer johnson and he shows&nbsp;
them the dog-like creature wayne comes in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:21.200
house from outside and shows them an area filled&nbsp;
with flying dragons chalking to death because of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:26.960
oxygen in the atmosphere harry theorizes that the&nbsp;
creatures are using ungrounds caves to survive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:34.000
and when they enter our atmosphere they are dying&nbsp;
soon the dragon gets up and it gives birth and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:41.040
newborn dragon adapts to the earth's oxygen and&nbsp;
flies off the dragon terrorizes people in maul&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:47.600
but soon kane and his team arrives there and&nbsp;
prepares their guns then they see the dragon&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:53.440
flying around they chase it and wayne uses the&nbsp;
mic to make noises to get dragon's attention&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:59.600
and kane gunned it to the ground they&nbsp;
celebrate their first kill while driving&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:04.800
soon the media is becoming increasingly&nbsp;
involved with the alien attacks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:09.920
the governor of arizona visits the&nbsp;
site and he asks them for the answers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:14.880
allison theorizes that if they don't stop&nbsp;
the invasion they'll lose the state of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:20.640
arizona in a week and the whole country in two&nbsp;
months we see the group arriving to the site&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:25.520
and after an argument they decide to work&nbsp;
together the general suggests that they make&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:30.720
a napalm strike to destroy the city which will&nbsp;
also kill the aliens the staff interferes and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:36.000
shows them that creatures started evolving into&nbsp;
strange animals and took out all the cctv cameras&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:42.640
there is a chaos in the site and few moments later&nbsp;
they are attacked by the primate-like creatures&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:49.040
wayne shoots it down upon seeing all this&nbsp;
the governor allows the general to use full&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:53.920
power and alison leaves the job after being&nbsp;
disgusted to know about the napalm strike plan&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:59.520
and she joins the team of kane she also brings&nbsp;
the stolen research samples that was taken by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:05.920
the government agencies the whole city is in&nbsp;
chaos some people are scared and is in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:11.840
process of being evacuated by the military and&nbsp;
some students are enjoying the whole situation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:17.520
the team of kane arrives to the local school&nbsp;
lab to find a way to kill this alien form&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:23.600
harry starts smoking and throws the burning stick&nbsp;
to the sample which triggers the alien to evolve&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:29.200
and now they come to a conclusion that the&nbsp;
alien form is multiplied due to the warm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:35.520
atmosphere of earth and since space has no heat&nbsp;
it wasn't evolving and if the military strikes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:41.680
it with a napalm bomb then the results will&nbsp;
be irreversible the staff at the site tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:47.200
general that allison tried to contact you however&nbsp;
the general no longer wants to listen from her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:55.440
in the lab cain sees the periodic table and he&nbsp;
notices that we are carbonic forms of life form&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:55.440 --> 00:09:00.400
and our poison is arsenic but the&nbsp;
aliens are nitrogen-based life form&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:07.040
so in that way they will be lethal to selenium&nbsp;
the two students suggest that head and shoulder&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:11.200
shampoo has selenium in it and that can&nbsp;
be used to kill the alien form as well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:17.280
then they make a plan to use it against the aliens&nbsp;
they collect it from all around the city and fill&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:24.480
the fire truck with it they make their way to the&nbsp;
site upon arriving there they go inside the site&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:30.320
so they can spray it in meantime the general is&nbsp;
ahead of his schedule and the governor visits him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:36.160
wayne goes outside the cave to operate the&nbsp;
truck but general starts the napalm strike&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:38.720
which makes the creatures evolve drastically&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:45.600
as they run for their life the earth opens and&nbsp;
they see the creature evolving into something big&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:50.960
what used to be a forest type closed environment&nbsp;
has now turned into something like a giant worm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:57.360
the giant worm-like thing starts taking over&nbsp;
the city the military tries to attack it but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:02.400
it does not stop soon the creature&nbsp;
gets ready to divide through mitosis&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:10.960
a way of reproducing seen earlier in the jar&nbsp;
till it takes over the planet wayne suggests&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:16.080
that they can still use the shampoo plan and&nbsp;
they head towards the direction of the creature&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:20.560
they maneuver their truck underneath&nbsp;
a giant worm hole of the creature&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:26.560
and experience a giant fart then harry and kane&nbsp;
make their way to the wormhole through a ladder&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.800
they pump it with shampoo and&nbsp;
as it gets filled with shampoo&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:37.120
it starts releasing some sort of liquid they make&nbsp;
their way out and it explodes like a giant pore&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:41.840
they all start to celebrate and alison kisses kane&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:48.320
later the governor declares them as heroes&nbsp;
and declares wayne as a new firefighter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:55.280
kane and allison escapes the conference to&nbsp;
start their new life in the end we see the team&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:55.280 --> 00:11:02.480
promoting head and shoulders for hair and fighting&nbsp;
aliens then the movie ends let me know what you&nbsp;&nbsp;
