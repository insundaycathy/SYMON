00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:06.480
Hi, Mystery Recapped here. Today I’m&nbsp;
going to explain a steampunk film called&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.280
“Mortal Engines,” Spoilers ahead!&nbsp;
Watch out and take care!
&nbsp;

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:20.320
The premise of the movie is set far in the future.&nbsp;
At the beginning of the movie, a voice tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:26.000
us about the most devastating war mankind has&nbsp;
ever faced in history, called the sixty minutes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
war. A war that only lasted for sixty minutes but&nbsp;
shattered the Earth's crust into a thousand pieces&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.040
that rearranged the former continents. The&nbsp;
few remaining humans formed mobile cities,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.920
called "Traction Cities,” the cities which&nbsp;
can move on wheels when needed. As several&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:47.200
such cities were established, a system called&nbsp;
Municipal Darwinism came into order. According&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:52.560
to Municipal Darwinism, the larger cities called&nbsp;
the Predators could hunt the smaller ones and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:57.120
take over their resources for survival. 
At the beginning of the movie, a girl hiding&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.080
her face under a scarf is overlooking the&nbsp;
mountains using her telescope. She sees a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:07.600
massive city of London approaching her way&nbsp;
and runs back to her town called Salzhaken.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.720
Salzhaken is being attacked by the large&nbsp;
predator city, London. As the officials find&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.400
out about London approaching them, everyone in&nbsp;
the town. The engines start, and within seconds,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:24.400
the town transforms into a vehicle, ready to&nbsp;
set off. London closes up on Salzhaken while it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.960
tries to escape. In London, many civilians enjoy&nbsp;
overviewing the chase through a class barrier as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:35.200
they cheer for their city to win. The Lord Mayor&nbsp;
of London is named Magnus Crome. He commands the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.920
operators on what measures to take. People&nbsp;
from Salzhaken try their best to escape but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.680
ultimately get caught under Crome’s command. The&nbsp;
town is then ingested into the predator city.
&nbsp;

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:51.920
Inside London, we see various infrastructures. It&nbsp;
has museums where statues of minions are praised&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.960
as “American deities.” It is revealed that people&nbsp;
interpreted the aftermath of the sixty-minute war&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.000
however they pleased. Tom Natsworthy is a&nbsp;
low-class Apprentice Historian of London.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.440
He works at the London museum. That day,&nbsp;
Katherine Valentine, the daughter of Deputy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:13.920
Lord Mayor Thaddeus Valentine, awaits Tom for a&nbsp;
history lesson. Tom is late to assist Katherine,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.520
but unlike other elites, she is friendly and kind&nbsp;
to him. The two walk around the museum, looking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:25.200
at historic things like smartphones and computers.&nbsp;
When Katherine shows interest in the sixty-second&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.400
war, Tom shows her a video of the war he was&nbsp;
able to retrieve from an old hard drive. 
&nbsp;

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.760
Tom explains that a quantum energy weapon called&nbsp;
the Medusa was used to fight the war and was the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.560
reason the earth was shattered into pieces. He&nbsp;
then reveals that the museum has several weapon&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.360
techs, but bits and pieces of them have been&nbsp;
going missing frequently. Since his seniors didn’t&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.240
respond to his concerns about the missing tech,&nbsp;
he has kept the weapons in a locker of his own, so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:56.400
they wouldn’t be stolen. Outside the room, Tom’s&nbsp;
senior Herbert eavesdrops on their conversation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.960
He demotes Tom to a lower level of the&nbsp;
city, but Katherine accompanies him. 
&nbsp;

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.040
Meanwhile, the people from Salzhaken are&nbsp;
made to evacuate their city, which is to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.520
be demolished later. They are told to bring&nbsp;
their belongings with them and are restricted&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:14.880
from bringing any weapons. However, the girl&nbsp;
with the scarf manages to smuggle in a knife.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.520
Tom and Katherine come to the lowest zone where&nbsp;
the people of Salzhaken are being checked.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:24.640
Their job is to gather new electronics that&nbsp;
the Salzhaken has. Tom is fascinated to see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:30.480
a toaster that is of the highest kind. Just&nbsp;
then, Deputy Lord Mayor and Katherine’s father,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:36.240
Valentine, praises Tom for knowing so much about&nbsp;
technology. As they talk, a worker brings a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:41.920
dangerous old tech device used in nuclear weapons&nbsp;
and hands it to Valentine. The way Valentine&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.800
talks about the weapon unsettles Tom. 
Meanwhile, the girl with the scarf approaches&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:51.920
Valentine. As he talks to the people, the girl&nbsp;
stabs him, saying that this is for her mother,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:57.360
Pandora Shaw. Valentine is shocked to hear the&nbsp;
name. Before the girl can make another strike,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:02.640
Tom stops her and chases after her as she runs&nbsp;
away. Both end up in the town of Salzhaken,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:08.320
which is now being demolished. They somehow manage&nbsp;
to get past the demolisher and to the waste chute.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:13.520
The girl falls into the chute but is caught by&nbsp;
Tom, who is intrigued to see a nasty scar on her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:18.720
face. She tells him her name is Hester Shaw and&nbsp;
that Valentine murdered her mother right before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.760
letting go of his hand. Hester then falls into&nbsp;
the chute before Valentine arrives at the place.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:28.240
Tom asks him about Pandora Shaw and&nbsp;
looks at Valentine in suspicion. 
&nbsp;

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:33.600
At last, Valentine pushes Tom to the waste chute&nbsp;
after Hester and acts innocent when his daughter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:39.040
arrives. Later, Katherine and Valentine are in&nbsp;
his chamber when she asks him about Pandora Shaw.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.120
He dismisses her question, but Katherine&nbsp;
is sure he is hiding something from her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.120
Meanwhile, Tom lands unconscious on&nbsp;
the outskirts of an unknown location,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:52.640
and Hester robs him of his money. When he wakes&nbsp;
up, she leaves him behind, but Tom follows her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:58.320
She is furious at Tom for ruining the plan she had&nbsp;
been working on for the past six months. Tom asks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.960
her to help him get back to London because that&nbsp;
is his home, but Hester ignores him and continues&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:08.720
walking. Back in London, the Lord Mayor is furious&nbsp;
at Valentine for bringing them to Europe because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:14.000
of which they are running low on food and water.&nbsp;
Valentine brings up his energy project and claims&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.800
that it is the only thing that can help London,&nbsp;
but the Lord Mayor is skeptical of his plan. 
&nbsp;

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:23.440
At night, Hester and Tom are resting when they&nbsp;
are attacked by some scavengers from the south&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:28.400
who hunt people. An old couple with their&nbsp;
land-roving vehicle come to their aid and save&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:34.240
them from the scavengers. They even give the two&nbsp;
a tiny room to rest. Hester was hurt while trying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:39.520
to save Tom from the scavengers earlier. She&nbsp;
dresses her wound to some extent and lies down.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:44.480
A while later, she tells Tom that her mother&nbsp;
Pandora Shaw, was an archeologist who loved&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:50.080
to dig up buried tech of the past. She worked&nbsp;
closely with Valentine, who was always fascinated&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:55.200
by her findings. Until one day, Pandora dug&nbsp;
up something that Valentine wanted and that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:02.000
she didn’t want him to have. That day, he killed&nbsp;
Pandora and sliced Hester’s face in the process.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.720
Hester also mentions a necklace that Pandora&nbsp;
handed her before asking her to run away. 
&nbsp;

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:10.800
A single tear rolls down her cheek&nbsp;
as she finishes telling the story.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:15.760
Meanwhile, back in London, Valentine visits&nbsp;
the repurposed St Paul's Cathedral where he is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:20.480
secretly developing the nuclear weapon Medusa.&nbsp;
The historic tech that has been going missing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:25.280
from the museum was stolen by Valentine for&nbsp;
the same purpose. He has realized that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:31.280
small cities to hunt upon are starting to vanish,&nbsp;
and soon, London will have no food and resources.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:36.560
Hence, he wants to strike the nonmoving kingdom&nbsp;
of Shan Guo, an Anti-Traction city that has all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:42.400
the resources London will need for hundreds of&nbsp;
years. However, Shan Guo is firmly protected by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:47.840
the "Shield Wall.” So, Valentine wants to create&nbsp;
Medusa to destroy it and take over the city.
&nbsp;

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:53.680
After that, Valentine hears the news of a&nbsp;
cyborg being found in the seas by a small town.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:58.800
He visits the creature when one of his companions&nbsp;
tells him he will be of use to kill Hester. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:04.080
creature is captured in a case and tells Valentine&nbsp;
that Hester has broken a promise she made to him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:09.200
because of which he wants to kill her. Hearing&nbsp;
this, Valentine lets the creature go. In the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:14.400
meantime, Katherine visits Tom’s friend Bevis&nbsp;
to ask him what her father is hiding from her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:19.280
Bevis somehow knows that Valentine pushed Tom to&nbsp;
the chute. Katherine almost doesn’t believe him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:24.480
when Bevis adds that her father is also running&nbsp;
a secret project. In return for the information,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:29.280
she offers to show him the historic tech that Tom&nbsp;
had shown her at the beginning of the movie. 
&nbsp;

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:34.160
Meanwhile, Hester is still asleep aboard the&nbsp;
old couple’s vehicle when Tom wakes her up.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:38.240
He says that the vehicle has turned&nbsp;
south, so the couple has lied to them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:42.800
Tom finds a way out under the floor, but&nbsp;
Hester cannot jump off because of her injury.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:47.680
He refuses to go without her, and both are&nbsp;
soon caught. They are then held hostage and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:52.480
put up for slave auction in a town. Hester&nbsp;
is almost bought by a man when suddenly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:57.760
a girl that stands out from the crowd claims&nbsp;
Hester for herself. The auctioneer recognizes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:02.890
the girl as a wanted criminal and member of&nbsp;
the Anti-Traction League, Anna Fang. She works&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:04.240
closely with Shan Guo’s leader Kwan and is here&nbsp;
to free Hester. She kills the auctioneer in a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:10.240
single shot and asks Tom and Hester to run away.&nbsp;
However, they do not reach far when suddenly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:16.560
the cyborg from earlier who wanted to kill Hester&nbsp;
arrives. Hester recognizes him as Shrike. 
&nbsp;

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:21.360
Shrike approaches the two as they run away from&nbsp;
him. He almost gets them, but they are saved by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:26.960
Anna again. Anna then flies them in her airship&nbsp;
and tells Hester she looks like her mother.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:32.160
Sensing the two’s curiosity, Hester reveals how&nbsp;
she knows Shrike. It turns out that he had found&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:38.080
her after Valentine killed Pandora and ever since&nbsp;
has been her parent. Shrike raised her and helped&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:44.320
her survive in the world. He is the only cyborg&nbsp;
left after all of his kind were killed. One day,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:49.360
Shrike was fed up with always seeing Hester sad,&nbsp;
so he made an exoskeleton with the intention&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:54.400
to transform her into a cyborg as well. Hester&nbsp;
promised him that she would go through with the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:59.680
plan but found out about Valentine’s whereabouts&nbsp;
right after. Hence, she ran away, and Shrike&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:05.040
followed her in order to kill her for breaking&nbsp;
the promise. Tom is stunned to hear the story. 
&nbsp;

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:09.280
The two are then taken to an airborne city&nbsp;
called the Airhaven, where they meet other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:14.480
remembers of the Anti-Traction League. They have&nbsp;
caught up upon Valentine’s suspicious activities&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:19.600
and know it has something to do with Pandora.&nbsp;
Hence, t have recruited Hester to find out more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:25.200
about Valentine’s plan. Hester informs them of&nbsp;
a box that Valentine killed her mother for. As&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:30.320
they talk about the box, Tom remembers the&nbsp;
time a worker handed Valentine an old tech&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:35.840
used in the sixty-second war. He finally realizes&nbsp;
that Valentine is planning to restart Medusa,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:40.160
the weapon that destroyed the earth many&nbsp;
centuries earlier. He tells everyone that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:45.840
the box was the computer core system to initiate&nbsp;
the quantum energy weapon, Medusa. The only way&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:51.520
to stop the weapon is a crash drive, a type of&nbsp;
key that overrides Medusa's firing sequence. 
&nbsp;

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:56.880
Back in London, Tom’s superior at work, Hebert&nbsp;
tells Valentine about the old tech that Tom&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:01.680
had hidden. He quickly sends his men to&nbsp;
recruit the devices. At the same time,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:07.120
Katherine also brings Bevis to the museum but&nbsp;
sees that the devices have already been stolen.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:12.000
The museum’s overseer shows them a secret way&nbsp;
to St Paul's Cathedral so that the duo can see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.800
Valentine’s project for themselves. They make&nbsp;
their way upstairs to the church, where they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:22.720
see a massive piece of machinery that Valentine&nbsp;
calls Medusa. It has finally been completed and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:29.040
is ready for attack. They hide behind a wall and&nbsp;
listen to Valentine talk about attacking Shan Guo.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:33.760
Just then, the current Lord Mayor enters&nbsp;
the Church and orders the guards to arrest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:39.520
Valentine for conducting the unlawful experiment.&nbsp;
However, the guards stay in place, revealing that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:45.680
they work for Valentine now. At last, he kills&nbsp;
the Lord Mayor as a horrified Katherine watches.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:50.800
The two escape from the stairs later. 
At the Airhaven, suddenly, the lights go off,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:56.640
and Shrike arrives looking for Hester. Chaos&nbsp;
ensues as the whole city lights on fire.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:56.640 --> 00:11:01.200
Tom and Hester run away from Shrike, but he&nbsp;
battles with the anti-Traction League members&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:06.480
and soon catches up with the two. He is almost&nbsp;
about to kill Tom when Hester begs him not to.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:11.280
Seeing her crying for someone, Shrike realizes&nbsp;
that she has finally found someone she loves&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:16.400
and isn’t unhappy anymore. That means he&nbsp;
doesn’t have to convert her into a cyborg.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:20.480
A severely injured Shrike hands Hester&nbsp;
the necklace Pandora had given her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:26.240
and dies instantly. Hester, Tom, and the members&nbsp;
of the Anti-Traction League now make their way&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:32.240
to the city of Shan Guo. They meet Shan Guo’s&nbsp;
Governor Kwan and tell him of Valentine’s plan.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:38.000
Anna suggests he help launch the Anti-Tractionist&nbsp;
fleet against London because if they strike first,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:43.280
the chances of Shan Guo’s survival are less.
Kwan orders the guards to strike at London&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:48.080
before they strike them. Tom retaliates, saying&nbsp;
that innocent Londoners should not be punished for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:52.960
Valentine’s mistakes. Kwan claims that if there&nbsp;
was another way to defend his city, he would.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:58.080
Then, everyone starts to prepare for the&nbsp;
battle as Tom walks away, annoyed. Hester&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:02.960
and an Anti-Tractionist League member Sathya&nbsp;
pray when Hester notices that the necklace&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:09.040
her mother gave her has a crash drive inside. She&nbsp;
and Tom quickly run to Anna to tell her about the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:14.800
finding. However, right then, Valentine launches&nbsp;
the first attack on the Shield wall that destroys&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:20.560
it partially. It sends the city of Shan Guo into&nbsp;
havoc. People are pushed around because of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:26.240
force created by the explosion. Immediately after&nbsp;
the first strike, Valentine orders to recharge&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:31.120
the system and launch the second strike again.&nbsp;
However, the recharging will take some time.
&nbsp;

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:35.120
After getting the crash drive, Anna and the&nbsp;
others from the Anti-Tractionist League,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:41.120
along with Hester and Tom, get on their respective&nbsp;
ships and fly towards London. Intense air combat&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:45.840
ensues between the two cities. Many of the&nbsp;
Anti-Tractionist League’s members are killed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:51.520
in the battle, but Anna, Tom, and Hester ascend&nbsp;
unharmed. Anna manages to hover the aircraft&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:56.800
above London, and Hester gets inside, taking&nbsp;
the crash drive with her. Sometime later, She&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:02.720
makes Tom handle the aircraft and gets herself to&nbsp;
London as well. She attacks Valentine upfront to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:08.640
distract him so that Hester can use the drive to&nbsp;
override the system. Now, only sixty seconds are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:13.840
left for the missile to be launched. But Hester&nbsp;
manages to stop it in the last few seconds. 
&nbsp;

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:19.200
Valentine looks over at Hester when Anna asks her&nbsp;
to run away. He then pushes Anna from a platform,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:23.920
killing her. Valentine finally confronts his&nbsp;
daughter Katherine outside and asks her to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:29.840
come with him to a safe place. She belittles him&nbsp;
for killing everyone for power and runs inside.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:35.760
Inside the control room of London, Valentine's&nbsp;
men kill all the operators. Enraged with his first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:41.120
plan not working, Valentine has decided to crash&nbsp;
the whole of London to the shield wall to break&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:43.520
it, putting the lives of both cities in danger.&nbsp;
Katherine tries to pull the brakes, but the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:49.440
system has been corrupted. She tells Tom about the&nbsp;
situation through a radio. Tom then asks Katherine&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:54.320
to open the engine’s gate. He flies inside the&nbsp;
engine system in his aircraft and destroys the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:59.200
engines by launching missiles in the hopes of&nbsp;
stopping London from colliding with the wall.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:03.440
At the same time, Valentine gets on an&nbsp;
aircraft to take off and avoid the crash&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:08.960
himself. However, Hester confronts the man and&nbsp;
points her gun at him. They get into a fight,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:13.360
and Hester remembers her mother had an affair&nbsp;
with Valentine. The thought distracts her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:18.240
and Valentine gets the upper hand. 
At last, she manages to free herself and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:23.840
latch onto Tom’s aircraft. When she is safe,&nbsp;
Tom launches a missile at Valentine’s aircraft&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:28.480
and finally kills him. London stops&nbsp;
seconds before crashing onto the wall&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:34.160
and all the residents come outside. They walk to&nbsp;
Shan Guo in the hopes of starting a new life.
&nbsp;

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:39.280
The movie ends as Tom and Hester hug, promising&nbsp;
to travel the world with one another.
