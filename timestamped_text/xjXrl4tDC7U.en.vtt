00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.500
Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:06.210
Today, I'm going to explain an action, sci-fi,
and thriller film called "In Time."

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:07.500
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.220
Watch out and take care.

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:13.139
In the future, humans have been genetically
modified to stop aging at 25.

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.512
The only caveat is when humans get to age
25, they only have one year left to live.

00:00:16.512 --> 00:00:20.939
A person’s life is shown on their forearm
with a timer, and time is now the world’s

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:21.939
currency.

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:25.530
The rich can basically live forever, while
the poor live their lives paycheck to paycheck,

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:26.530
literally.

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:29.990
Will wakes up and sees he has less than 24
hours left.

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.510
He heads down and greets his mother, Rachel,
who is celebrating her 50th birthday.

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.710
Their celebration is cut short when they start
talking about finances.

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.989
Rachel says she has three days left on her
time and reminds Will of bills and loans they

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:42.200
need to pay.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.489
Will reassures her that he’ll come up with
the money.

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.790
Rachel says she’ll be away for two days
working and she’ll pay a loan.

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.300
She tells Will he has to meet with her at
a bus station so he can give her more time.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.219
She then hands will thirty minutes so he can
pay for a decent lunch.

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:56.680
Will kisses her goodbye before heading to
work.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.500
On his way to work, Will runs into a kid,
Maya.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.379
She asks for a minute and Will happily gives
her five minutes and sends her away smiling.

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:06.230
He arrives at work and meets with his friend
Borel.

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:09.130
Will works at a factory making time storage
devices.

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.820
After a hard day’s work, he clocks out and
gets paid.

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.360
He sees that his payment is lacking and demands
more, but the distributor says the quota has

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.370
increased and Will didn’t reach it.

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:20.440
Will later meets heads to a local bar and
some men invite him to gamble but he turns

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.920
him down, but not after reminding one of the
men he owes Will an hour.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.030
Will takes the hour and meets with Borel.

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.380
Borel is drunk, pointing to someone who’s
been buying drinks for everyone.

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.760
He says the man has over a century in his
time.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.020
Will spots someone eyeing the man, and he
decides to inform the man, Henry, that somebody

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.200
is watching him.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.990
Will tells the man to leave as he’s attracting
too much attention, but the man refuses.

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.380
A group of men enters and everyone at the
bar is suddenly rushing out.

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.640
Borel tells Will that they’re minutemen,
gangsters who rob and extort.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.620
Borel pulls Will away, but Will intends to
stay and watch.

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:54.210
He assures Borel that he wouldn’t do anything
stupid, and Borel leaves him.

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.560
The leader, Fortis, tells Henry he wants his
time and even offers Henry the chance to fight

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.660
for it.

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:01.870
Henry appears nauseous and heads to the bathroom.

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:04.100
He vomits while a minuteman keeps watches.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.840
Will suddenly bursts in, knocks the guy out,
and takes Henry with him.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.399
Will and Henry run out and Fortis and his
men chase after them.

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.260
They manage to escape after climbing over
a gate and hiding inside an abandoned building.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.420
The minutemen are close behind and almost
find them, but eventually give up their chase

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.360
when one of the men tells Fortis that he recognized
Will.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.060
Will and Henry get acquainted, and Henry reveals
he’s 105 years old.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.230
He says his mind is fatigued, and he desires
death, explaining his rash behavior.

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.490
Will gets mad, considering that he and his
mother have to work several jobs just to live

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:32.990
another day.

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.570
Henry then reveals the secrets of their horrific
world.

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.260
Rich people increase the cost of living so
that poor people keep dying, and, in turn,

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:40.750
more time goes to the rich.

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.580
The reality is that there is more than enough
time for everyone.

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.320
However, greed and lust for immortality blind
the rich and powerful.

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.280
Henry asks Will what he'll do if he had the
same amount of time as him.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.680
Will answers that if he has that time, he
will not waste it like Henry.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.620
Henry thinks about what Will says, and the
two get rest.

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.060
Morning comes, and Henry decides to give all
but five minutes of his time to a sleeping

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.060
Will.

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.630
After a while, Will wakes up and discovers
he has over a century in his time.

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.180
He looks for Henry and sees him sitting atop
a bridge.

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.670
As Henry’s final seconds count down, and
he smiles falls into the river.

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:16.050
Later, Will heads to Borel and sees Borel’s
wife, Greta, holding their newborn baby.

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.030
Will asks for Borel, and he reveals to him
the time he has.

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.730
Will talks about the events of the night before,
and Borel asks what he plans to do.

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.480
Now that he has learned the truth, Will intends
to bring justice.

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.820
Before leaving, Will gives Borel.

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.730
With his fortune, Borel eyes the bar on the
other side of the street.

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.750
Meanwhile, Rachel pays a loan of two days
and attempts to ride the bus but finds that

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.209
she can’t afford the fare as the prices
have gone up.

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:40.590
She pleads to the driver and the passengers,
but everyone looks away.

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.890
Feeling desperate, she starts running.

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.600
The two are in a race against time, and with
every second and every step, death draws closer

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:47.620
for Rachel.

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.690
Finally, they see each other.

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.760
They run as fast as they can, but death beats
Rachel and Will.

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.140
A lifeless Rachel falls into Will’s arms.

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.020
Will weeps, knowing they were mere seconds
away from living the life they’ve always

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:59.020
wanted.

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:02.210
Will now has all the time he’s ever wanted,
but his mother has none.

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:05.760
The following day, timekeepers retrieve Henry's
body from the river.

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:11.560
Raymond, the senior timekeeper, and Jaeger,
his junior, investigate the scene.

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.620
As they're about to leave, Raymond sees a
camera on top of the bridge.

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.960
Meanwhile, Will sits inside a car wearing
a new suit and a new look on his face.

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:22.650
They leave the time zone, a border that separates
the different social classes.

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.590
On his trip, they pass multiple borders, paying
a toll fee that increases with each one.

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:30.580
The last border costs Will a year, and the
driver welcomes him to the city of New Greenwich.

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.830
The driver asks Will what his true intentions
are for coming to New Greenwich, and Will

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.440
answers he wants to make the people of New
Greenwich pay.

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.220
The city is entirely different from what Will
is used to.

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.990
As he exits the car, he immediately starts
running, still used to living with little

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.990
time.

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.910
He looks at his arm and starts acting more
like a person who has all the time in the

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:47.910
world.

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.630
However, he already caught the attention of
a woman named Sylvia.

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:52.980
Will enters a hotel and asks for a suite.

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:56.570
In his luxurious room, Will wakes up still
with 105 years.

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:59.810
Even though he lies down in the comfiest of
beds in a room with the best view, the untimely

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:01.660
death of his mom still haunts him.

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:05.190
For the first time in his life, he experiences
gourmet food and drinks.

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.670
He pays for his meal and tips the waitress
a week.

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:10.880
The waitress notices that Will doesn't act
like everyone else, saying he does everything

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.389
a little too fast.

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:15.660
Will cheekily replies that he doesn't finish
fast in the things that matter.

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:19.660
Will plans to enter the casino, but first,
he has to have a wardrobe change.

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:22.660
In the timekeeper's headquarters, they see
Will in the surveillance footage.

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:26.230
Jaeger reports that a man crossed numerous
borders going to New Greenwich.

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:29.490
They gather more information about Will on
the computer, and Raymond states that he knows

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:30.800
Will’s father.

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.139
Will enters a casino and sits at a poker table.

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:37.560
As the dealer deals, Philippe, a billinaire
with eons in his time, acquaints himself with

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:38.560
Will.

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.280
Will's winnings after a few rounds of Poker
amounts to over two centuries.

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.990
Philippe increases the pot by 50 years.

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:47.949
Despite this, Will calls with total confidence,
and the river turns out to be the six of diamonds.

00:05:47.949 --> 00:05:52.389
Will’s focus shifts from the game to the
lovely dame, Sylvia, who sits beside Philippe.

00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:56.030
Philippe rolls up his sleeves, revealing almost
ten millennia's worth of time.

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:59.790
He then talks about the immeasurable gap between
the poor and the rich, justifying it as natural

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:00.790
selection.

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:02.570
He raises two more centuries.

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:05.919
Will bites and calls, leaving his arm with
a mere 30 seconds left.

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:08.820
The outcome favors Will, and he receives a
millennium.

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:10.910
This brought a thrill to Philippe’s dull
life.

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:14.600
He notices Will looking at Sylvia and asks
if he thinks she's his grandmother, mother,

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:15.770
or wife.

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:17.590
Will simply says that she's beautiful.

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:21.190
Philippe introduces her as his daughter, and
she invites him to a party.

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:25.130
The next day, Will purchases a brand new car
with his winnings which he drives to Philippe's

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:26.130
mansion.

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:29.110
There he's introduced to three generations
of women that look as if they're sisters.

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:31.550
Will looks out of place among the high-class
crowd.

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:33.740
Sylvia approaches and saves him from a lonely
night.

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:36.910
They get to know more about one another, and
their conversation leads them to the dance

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:37.910
floor.

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:41.419
She asks him if he comes from the ghetto,
but Will neither admits nor denies her claims.

00:06:41.419 --> 00:06:44.420
Sylvia opens up to him about her meaningless
life and how the time that she has shackles

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:46.570
her when it's supposed to grant her freedom.

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:49.830
While this is happening, Philippe and her
wife stare at the two with watchful eyes,

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:52.520
causing Will to lead Sylvia outside to the
beach.

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:55.030
Will and Sylvia undress and dives into the
waters.

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:58.389
They float on the ocean, naked and inches
apart, with the moonlight glowing on their

00:06:58.389 --> 00:06:59.440
arms.

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:02.430
Sylvia distances herself, but the waves push
her closer to him.

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:05.960
Suddenly, someone calls out from the shore,
disrupting the romantic moment.

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:09.430
They return, and Philippe asks Will to join
him for a game of Poker.

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:12.479
However, the timekeepers barge in and confront
Will.

00:07:12.479 --> 00:07:15.479
They sit him in an office, and Raymond introduces
himself.

00:07:15.479 --> 00:07:19.100
He asks him why he's in New Greenwich and
how he has over a millennium's worth of time.

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:21.920
Will answers honestly and says that Henry
gave it to him, committing suicide in the

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:23.070
process.

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:26.750
Raymond doubts his explanation, confiscates
his time, and arrests him.

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:30.270
As he leaves, Will asks him why he investigates
suicide when murders happen in the ghetto

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:31.500
every day.

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:34.710
Raymond is astounded by his statement as it
reminds him of Will's father.

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:38.380
Will then attacks the timekeepers guarding
him and rushes out to hold Sylvia hostage.

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:41.530
They enter through the kitchen, and the two
drive off on his car.

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:45.840
A car chase occurs, and Raymond rams Will’s
car, causing them to lose control.

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:49.320
Will expertly maneuvers while on reverse,
barely dodging an incoming truck.

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:51.889
They lose the timekeepers and hide underneath
a bridge.

00:07:51.889 --> 00:07:54.789
Will asks for Sylvie’s time, but she refuses.

00:07:54.789 --> 00:07:58.280
Morning comes, and they drive along the highways
and run over traffic spikes.

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:00.500
The tire punctures, and they crash.

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:02.970
Fortis and his men approach the unconscious
couple.

00:08:02.970 --> 00:08:07.020
He siphons time from Sylvia, but they leave
in a hurry, leaving her with thirty minutes.

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:10.160
Will gives her a few minutes, and they run
off to get more time.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.860
With three minutes left, Will knocks on Borel's
door.

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:16.620
Greta answers and informs Will that Borel
has died due to alcohol poisoning.

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:19.650
Sylvia is in distress as she only has a handful
of minutes left.

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:22.660
Will notices her earring, and they rush to
the jewelry dealer.

00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:25.990
Seeing that they're desperate, he underpays
them and offers only two days.

00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:29.830
Will accepts, and they immediately hide as
they hear the timekeeper’s sirens.

00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:33.050
They walk through the city, talking about
Sylvia's family business.

00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:36.079
Will asks how much they're worth, and she
replies it's too much to the point that knowing

00:08:36.079 --> 00:08:37.300
it won't matter.

00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:40.499
Will calls Raymond and asks for Philippe to
transfer a thousand years to the ghetto city

00:08:40.499 --> 00:08:42.149
in exchange for Sylvia.

00:08:42.149 --> 00:08:45.589
Raymond warns him that if he continues, he'll
end up dead like his father.

00:08:45.589 --> 00:08:48.759
Will says his father died fighting someone,
but Raymond says Will’s father was doing

00:08:48.759 --> 00:08:50.129
something more dangerous.

00:08:50.129 --> 00:08:53.310
Night arrives, and Sylvia makes herself at
home at Will's apartment.

00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:56.600
She asks about his family, and Will opens
up about her mother's passing.

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:59.579
He reminisces about his father and how he
was a gambler like him but on a different

00:08:59.579 --> 00:09:00.579
game.

00:09:00.579 --> 00:09:03.660
His father would play a game akin to gambling,
but using his time.

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:06.920
His father won a lot, but his acts of generosity
caused his death.

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:09.920
They find out they’re around the same age,
and their bond grows stronger as they share

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:12.019
more about each other’s past.

00:09:12.019 --> 00:09:15.290
Morning comes, and he observes if Philippe
holds up his end of the deal.

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:18.920
Will sees no time transfers, leaving Sylvia
disappointed with her father.

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:22.279
Despite not receiving the time, Will still
intends to let Sylvia go.

00:09:22.279 --> 00:09:25.610
He escorts her to the phone booth, giving
her a gun as a farewell gift, and she returns

00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:27.160
the favor with a kiss.

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:30.259
She calls her father and berates him for not
delivering what Will wants.

00:09:30.259 --> 00:09:33.980
As they talk, Will is behind her, oblivious
of Raymond pointing a gun at him.

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:37.600
Sylvia turns and sees Raymond, and without
hesitation, she shoots him.

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:40.639
Will points a gun at a bleeding Raymond, but
instead of taking his time, he gives some

00:09:40.639 --> 00:09:43.480
to Raymond, and the two drive off using his
car.

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:47.610
The two are parked on the side of the main
road, and Sylvia asks if he has any plans.

00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:51.290
Since they're in a cop car, they play the
part of a timekeeper, blocking an unfortunate

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:52.320
driver.

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:56.160
Sylvia gets too comfortable with the gun and
fires a shot, scaring Will and the driver.

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:59.139
They steal from the passenger and leaves with
the new vehicle.

00:09:59.139 --> 00:10:02.439
Later that day, the two sit in the backseat
and watch the news about them.

00:10:02.439 --> 00:10:05.569
Will states that she can still return to her
father, but Sylvia doesn't want to return

00:10:05.569 --> 00:10:07.029
to her boring life.

00:10:07.029 --> 00:10:10.769
Will leans in for another kiss, now having
time to do more than just that.

00:10:10.769 --> 00:10:14.769
In his office, Philippe talks to his partners
and assures them that he didn't pay the ransom.

00:10:14.769 --> 00:10:18.149
They doubt his capabilities to resolve this
issue, but Raymond enters the room before

00:10:18.149 --> 00:10:20.449
Philippe gets a chance to explain himself.

00:10:20.449 --> 00:10:23.269
He tells Philippe about her daughter not wanting
to be rescued.

00:10:23.269 --> 00:10:27.149
Philippe apologizes and attributes his daughter's
stubbornness to Stockholm Syndrome.

00:10:27.149 --> 00:10:30.579
Raymond does not budge and informs him that
he plans to arrest his daughter.

00:10:30.579 --> 00:10:34.779
Philippe tries to bribe him with his time,
but Raymond remains uninterested and leaves.

00:10:34.779 --> 00:10:37.839
The next day, Will teaches Sylvia how to shoot
a gun properly.

00:10:37.839 --> 00:10:40.769
They talk about Will's plan to give time to
the people, and she says that she can help

00:10:40.769 --> 00:10:42.649
him get the time he needs.

00:10:42.649 --> 00:10:46.509
At the local loaning establishment, a truck
suddenly crashes through the glass panes.

00:10:46.509 --> 00:10:50.440
The two pull off a heist, stealing as much
time storing devices as they can.

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:53.589
They encourage the borrowers to get as much
time as they want, and they all come rushing

00:10:53.589 --> 00:10:54.589
in.

00:10:54.589 --> 00:10:58.129
Later that day, Will gives time to Greta,
Maya, and even the timeline distributor who

00:10:58.129 --> 00:10:59.730
gives people time as charity.

00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:02.339
Fortis continues to harass and kill people
for time.

00:11:02.339 --> 00:11:05.970
He then sees on display a reward for ten years
for the capture of Will and Sylvia.

00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:09.420
Meanwhile, Philippe watches the news about
his daughter's continuous pursuits to steal

00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:10.779
from him.

00:11:10.779 --> 00:11:14.769
Later that night, Raymond and the timekeepers
surround a motel where the two stay in.

00:11:14.769 --> 00:11:18.339
Will and Sylvia notice they’re surrounded,
so they jump out the window to escape.

00:11:18.339 --> 00:11:21.420
Raymond chases after them through the streets
and the dark alleyways.

00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:24.029
They make their way up the roofs, and a shootout
commences.

00:11:24.029 --> 00:11:26.870
They manage to board a bus, losing Raymond.

00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:29.279
Fortis continues his search for Will and Sylvia.

00:11:29.279 --> 00:11:32.120
He interrogates a group, threatening to steal
their time.

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:36.360
When one dies, a man steps up and says he
has information about their whereabouts.

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:39.860
At the motel, the two sit on the couch together,
talking about the challenges they're about

00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:40.899
to face.

00:11:40.899 --> 00:11:43.399
They both accept that if they get caught,
they will die.

00:11:43.399 --> 00:11:46.899
At the period they've spent together, and
at every time they almost died, Sylvia felt

00:11:46.899 --> 00:11:48.250
more alive than ever.

00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:51.559
Suddenly, the door gets knocked down by Fortis
and his men.

00:11:51.559 --> 00:11:54.779
Feeling generous, Fortis gives Will a chance
to play for his life.

00:11:54.779 --> 00:11:58.459
Fortis rolls up his sleeve for a game of strong-arm,
and Will accepts his challenge.

00:11:58.459 --> 00:12:02.920
Will struggles up to his final seconds; then,
he turns it around when Fortis loses focus.

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:06.079
His subordinates approach the table, and the
fear in his eyes grows.

00:12:06.079 --> 00:12:09.929
Will grabs a gun from his ankle and shoots
everyone while siphoning Fortis dry.

00:12:09.929 --> 00:12:13.519
Will and Sylvia stand on a rooftop, observing
how prices keep rising.

00:12:13.519 --> 00:12:16.449
Will feels hopeless, saying that the rich
will just increase the cost of living every

00:12:16.449 --> 00:12:17.749
time they steal.

00:12:17.749 --> 00:12:20.619
He says that only a million years will make
a difference.

00:12:20.619 --> 00:12:23.149
Sylvia agrees, but she has a plan in mind.

00:12:23.149 --> 00:12:26.899
The next day, Philippe enters a building with
a plethora of bodyguards surrounding him.

00:12:26.899 --> 00:12:29.889
Slyvia catches their attention and asks for
this father.

00:12:29.889 --> 00:12:32.940
Among the guards is Will, who points a gun
directly at Philippe’s head.

00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:36.420
He commands the guards to put their weapons
down, and they take Philippe hostage.

00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:40.079
In his office is a time vault, and in there
sits a device with a million years.

00:12:40.079 --> 00:12:43.869
Philippe tries to explain that society will
fail if that time falls to the wrong hands.

00:12:43.869 --> 00:12:47.519
He says that there will always be someone
willing to sacrifice people for a shot at

00:12:47.519 --> 00:12:48.519
immortality.

00:12:48.519 --> 00:12:51.769
Will cannot contain his anger and points a
gun at him, but he recoups his calmness.

00:12:51.769 --> 00:12:55.509
Will tells Philippe that immortality is not
worth the life of even a single individual.

00:12:55.509 --> 00:12:56.920
The two then leave.

00:12:56.920 --> 00:13:00.070
Meanwhile, police vehicles start to barricade
the main road.

00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:04.019
The timekeepers shoot at Will and Sylvia’s
car, but they miraculously get through unharmed,

00:13:04.019 --> 00:13:06.149
ramming the toll booth to cross the border.

00:13:06.149 --> 00:13:08.660
Raymond doesn’t give up and chases after
them.

00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:11.839
They arrive at the ghetto, and as they’re
about to reach safety, Raymond intercepts

00:13:11.839 --> 00:13:13.040
and crashes into them.

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:16.670
Will exits unscathed and asks Maya to distribute
the one million years.

00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:20.199
Raymond points a gun at the two, but the clamoring
crowd blocks his line of sight, allowing for

00:13:20.199 --> 00:13:21.540
them to escape.

00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:24.230
Raymond hijacks a car, and the chase continues.

00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:26.910
Finally, they clash in the middle of the road.

00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:30.439
Raymond admits that he’s also from the ghetto,
and as he learned how to escape from poverty,

00:13:30.439 --> 00:13:33.259
his eyes were also opened to the hard truth
that the gap between the rich and the poor

00:13:33.259 --> 00:13:34.690
has to be maintained.

00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:37.300
As they talk, Raymond realizes that his time
is up.

00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:40.859
He dies on the spot, and the two try to find
a way to replenish theirs.

00:13:40.859 --> 00:13:44.499
In the distance is Raymond’s car; they run
towards it with seconds on their clock.

00:13:44.499 --> 00:13:46.609
Will gets there first and receives his time.

00:13:46.609 --> 00:13:48.800
He then runs to Sylvie who has seconds left.

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:51.749
The two run into each other’s arms in the
nick of time, and the two get to live for

00:13:51.749 --> 00:13:53.319
another day.

00:13:53.319 --> 00:13:56.209
Citizens are now crossing borders into more
expensive zones.

00:13:56.209 --> 00:13:59.829
The minutemen watch on as their societal hierarchy
begins collapsing.

00:13:59.829 --> 00:14:12.199
Sylvie and Will continue their routine, this
time making their way to a massive timebank.
