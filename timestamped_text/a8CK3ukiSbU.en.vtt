00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.500
Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:06.080
Today, I'm going to explain a war, action,
and sci-fi film called “Overlord."

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:07.290
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.120
Watch out and take care.&nbsp;

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.599
&nbsp;
In 1944, during World War two, a squad of

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:15.059
paratroopers is on a mission to destroy a
radio-jamming tower set up by Germans in an

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:16.059
old church.

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:21.420
As the plane nears the target location, Boyce,
a timid soldier, quietly calms himself down

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.550
before their descent.

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:31.020
Some squad members include Tibbet, Rosenfeld,
Grunauer, Chase, a photographer, and Ford,

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.469
an explosives expert assigned on this mission
after an exemplary performance in his last

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:35.469
mission.

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:39.109
The ride becomes shaky, causing Boyce to drop
his chain; Tibbet grabs it quickly and bullies

00:00:39.109 --> 00:00:40.569
him for having a lucky charm.

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:44.579
Boyce’s performance in the army is unsatisfactory,
making the other soldiers in his batch bully

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:45.589
him.

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:50.559
Moments later, Sergeant Rensin, the squad
leader, enters the main area of the aircraft

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:52.769
to set some reminders before they land.

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:56.289
He starts asking questions, and when he reaches
Boyce, he fails to respond.

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:00.920
Boyce’s already low confidence has decreased
even more, but the mission must continue.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.030
Sergeant Rensin gives his final speech to
the soldiers before returning to the cockpit.

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.710
Hundreds of planes and ships make their way
to France, and at the moment, all the fighters

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.130
could do is wait and hope for the best.&nbsp;

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.909
&nbsp;
The aircraft starts to rumble, signaling that

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.280
airstrikes are happening not so far away.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.490
As they get closer to the location, more explosions
come along their way, but the aircraft manages

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:19.490
to dodge it.

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.810
The explosions become worse, and the other
planes alongside them crash.

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.979
The sight of it puts the rest of the soldiers
in a state of panic, but the sergeant tries

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.170
to calm them down by talking to them.

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.640
Bullets from below penetrate through the plane,
causing deaths among the squad members.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.039
The signal light in the plane turns red, which
means that the soldiers are now on standby

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:36.210
to jump out.

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.890
Unfortunately, the plane catches fire, and
some of the soldiers fatally fall toward the

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.750
back, burning themselves.

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.070
Some of the surviving soldiers manage to jump
out of the aircraft after the signal goes

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.070
green.

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.390
Boyce struggles to compose himself; the whole
situation overwhelms him in ways he has not

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:50.900
experienced before.

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.530
The sergeant pushes him out in the open air,
where thousands of bullets are present.

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.539
Boyce could see the battlefield in a bird’s
eye view, and he lets the moment sink in that

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:00.420
this is it—this is the day that they have
all been training for.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.890
He falls near a body of water and almost drowns
in the process because he struggles to free

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.399
himself from the parachute.

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.310
Finally, he gets out of the water and secures
a weapon with him before running to the woods.

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.761
On his way to find other soldiers, Boyce finds
the sergeant surrounded and taunted by German

00:02:12.761 --> 00:02:13.959
soldiers.

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:18.010
Before attempting to attack and save the sergeant,
Ford comes from behind Boyce to stop him.

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.330
Both of the soldiers witness the execution
of their leader, and Ford explains that the

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:22.860
mission must be carried out.

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.709
They continue to walk deeper into the woods,
where they hear people approaching.

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:29.599
Surviving soldiers reveal themselves, and
all of them share a moment of joy in their

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:30.599
reunion.

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:34.989
The lot of them continue to advance across
the field, hoping to find more American soldiers.

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:39.129
Unfortunately, one of them missteps and triggers
a landmine, so an explosion goes off, leaving

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:40.239
them injured.

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:42.529
Boyce gains consciousness and walks carefully
to a safe spot.&nbsp;

00:02:42.529 --> 00:02:45.340
&nbsp;
Survival is their utmost priority at the moment,

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.159
but their mission is yet to be done.

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:50.630
The group takes a break from walking and stumbles
upon a dead animal carcass, which they find

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.080
hard to identify.

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.590
Its bone structure is different from a dog;
Chase hints that the creature is a jackal—

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.799
a biblical creature known as hell dogs.

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:00.680
Tibbet dismisses the idea and refuses to believe
in any myth.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.300
A distant noise catches Boyce’s attention,
so he signals the group that something or

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:05.890
someone might be nearby.

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.400
They await the footsteps and meet a girl named
Chloe.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.761
She runs in fear of the Americans, but they
catch up and hold her at gunpoint, where she

00:03:12.761 --> 00:03:14.799
is forced to lead them to an old church.

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:17.879
Boyce comforts her by saying that she will
not get hurt, but she has no choice but to

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:19.270
help the Americans.

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:22.549
All of them head to the village where the
church is located, and at the entrance, Ford

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:25.520
commands Boyce to keep an eye on Chloe while
they check the premises.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.969
The commotion wakes up Chloe’s neighbor,
Mrs. Lesner, who reports her to the German

00:03:29.969 --> 00:03:31.879
guards for being out past curfew.

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:35.349
The guards start to emerge, making Boyce hide
and find a way to be out of their sight while

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:38.189
they inspect Chloe, who manages to talk her
way out.

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:41.329
She lets the group take refuge in her house
while they carry out their mission.

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:44.989
A quick tour of the home is given to the soldiers
just in case they need to hide.

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:48.409
Tibbet hears a noise from a room upstairs,
so he asks Chloe about it.

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:51.730
According to her, her sick aunt lives with
her and cuts the topic short.

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.010
She also has a little brother named Paul,
who she takes care of after German soldiers

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:57.010
killed their parents.&nbsp;

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.280
&nbsp;
The soldiers settle in the tiny attic, where

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.650
they gather their weapons and optimize their
plan.

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.860
A woman’s scream interrupts their meeting;
the commotion outside is caused by German

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.220
soldiers executing one of the village residents
for an unknown reason.

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.130
Chloe then explains that the killings have
become a norm in their village since the Germans

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:12.130
have taken over.

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:15.220
She warns the group that they cannot stay
at her place because of frequent inspections,

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.390
but Ford says that they only need four hours,
so she agrees.

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:21.750
The group gets into an argument about delaying
the mission, but to their surprise, Boyce

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.390
initiates the advance.

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:26.700
In the sergeant's words, he reminds them that
the planes cannot provide air support to the

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.760
bases unless they take the tower down.

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.670
However, Tibbet continues to bully him, discouraging
the poor soldier that he is not built for

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:33.670
battle.

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:37.910
The angry Tibbet gets interrupted by Paul,
who playfully asks him to have a game of baseball.

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:41.700
He gets more hot-headed, so Chloe explains
that Paul thinks all Americans play baseball,

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.310
but he walks away.&nbsp;

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:44.980
&nbsp;
Boyce makes his way downstairs after Ford

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:46.270
orders him to.

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.890
On his way, he hears Chloe’s aunt coughing
in the room across the hallway, so he checks

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:51.720
and sees a disfigured woman.

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.290
Her skin looks wholly burnt, and she looks
terribly ill.

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:57.890
Chloe explains since her aunt returned from
the church, which is the base of the Germans,

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:59.470
she has not spoken since.

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.820
She suspects that multiple experiments were
done on her, causing physical and mental trauma.

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.610
&nbsp;
That night, Tibbet and Chase depart to check

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.600
on the German base when the German soldiers
conduct another inspection in the village.

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.850
Ford hears it right away, so he and Boyce
decide to stay put in the attic, where Paul

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:14.160
hides as well.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.710
The German commander named Wafner knocks at
Chloe’s door to visit her.

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:20.710
He coerces Chloe for intercourse.

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:23.970
After she refuses to give in, he calls his
men inside to check the attic after hearing

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:24.970
a noise.

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:28.800
Luckily, Paul blocks the entrance, passing
a baseball to the German soldier, who spits

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.720
at it, and passes it back to him.

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.960
To Boyce and Ford’s relief, the German soldiers
come down after almost catching them.

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.580
Wafner threatens to send Chloe to the church
to be “fixed” if she does not make love

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:38.620
with him.

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:42.520
Without a choice, she lets Wafner take advantage
of her with evident disgust on her face.

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.430
Boyce cannot ignore this and interrupts Wafner,
who is now held at gunpoint.

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:49.270
Ford is forced to follow suit and assist Boyce
downstairs.

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:53.250
He incapacitates and restrains Wafner, who
is helpless in the current situation.&nbsp;

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:56.970
Ford orders Boyce to move to the church tower,
taking advantage of the night.

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:59.880
Through the woods, Boyce makes his way to
a nearby entrance to wait for the perfect

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.020
time to enter.

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:04.570
He sees a truck full of people with disfigured
bodies who are almost on the brink of death.

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:09.721
A project that experiments on humans for warfare
is orchestrated by Dr. Schmidt, the head of

00:06:09.721 --> 00:06:12.930
the experimentation on French civilians and
dead German soldiers.

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:16.410
He goes to the site to see the “failed tests”
get burned using a flamethrower.

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:19.910
Confused about the intentions behind the experiments,
Boyce goes on to conduct the mission and walks

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:20.930
through the dark forest.

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:24.870
A truck of German soldiers passes by, making
him hide on the side of the road.

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:28.490
An aggressive dog emerges from the dark and
starts growling at him; it eventually chases

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:31.020
him, leaving him no choice but to enter the
truck.

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:34.880
Boyce climbs the truck only to find dead soldiers
piled up, so he panics as he covers himself

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:36.770
with a lifeless body on top.

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:39.740
They arrive at the church, and two soldiers
unload the truck.

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:43.160
This bids Boyce some time to sneak out and
make his way through the tower.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:46.520
Surrounded by the enemies, every step he takes
is crucial, as one mistake could cost him

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:47.520
his life.

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:50.990
He arrives at an underground section of the
church, which looks like a prison.

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:54.860
He hears muffled noises of people bound in
small cells and hides as two inspectors arrive.

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:58.120
Curious about the eerie sound coming from
the cell, he peeks at it and sees a human

00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:59.120
and creature hybrid.&nbsp;

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:01.220
&nbsp;
Meanwhile, Tibbet and Chase safely make it

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:02.660
back to Chloe’s home.

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:05.780
Boyce goes further into the experiment labs
to get more answers about the questionable

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:06.780
creatures.

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:10.510
A body bag moves right above him, so he opens
it and sees a person drenched in serum, who

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:11.950
is barely alive.

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:15.500
He then sees syringes laid on a table and
gets one to bring a sample to Ford.

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:19.700
He suspects that the red liquid serum is responsible
for the disfiguration of the bodies that he

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:20.700
saw.

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:23.690
Not far from where he stands, he hears a voice
asking for help; willing to find out, Boyce

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:26.310
opens a curtain and sees a bodiless head asking
for help.

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:29.550
Horror fills his face because it seems too
difficult to believe.

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:32.860
He leaves and discovers that Rosenfeld is
bound to a bed, which he tries to free but

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:35.240
gets interrupted once German doctors arrive.

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:38.630
He sees a dead soldier being injected with
the serum, but it is ineffective, so they

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:40.060
dispose of his body.

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:43.190
Boyce pulls a massive needle out of Rosenfeld
to save and free him.

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:46.620
Both of them utilize a tomb to find their
way out of the church, which they are successful

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:47.620
at.

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:50.770
They arrive at the house, where Boyce finally
breaks down after holding his emotions inside

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:52.000
the church.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.420
Ford struggles to understand the words he
is saying and realizes that Boyce has shifted

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:57.790
his attention from the mission to the experiments.

00:07:57.790 --> 00:08:01.480
He shows Ford the serum, and they ask Wafner
about it, but he does not disclose any helpful

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:03.450
information, even as Ford tortures him.

00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:07.630
Wafner is in a helpless situation, but he
remains loyal to his roots, making Ford more

00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:08.630
aggressive.

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:11.920
Boyce tries to stop him, but he gets hurt
in the process, making him walk out of the

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:12.920
room.

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:16.760
As the squad prepares to attack the church,
Chase checks on Wafner, who attempts to escape

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:18.890
and fatally shoots him after acting unconscious.

00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:22.980
Still, with a sack over his head, he blindly
shoots around, but he is stopped after the

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:24.320
group comes up.

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:27.600
Before losing his final breath, Chase asks
for his camera, and all of them dramatically

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:28.650
witness his death.

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:31.870
Boyce gets into the idea of injecting the
serum into Chase, thinking that it would save

00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:32.870
him.

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:35.169
In a matter of minutes, Chase gets up and
is in prime condition.

00:08:35.169 --> 00:08:38.430
He even pokes his bullet wounds and is numb
from the pain.

00:08:38.430 --> 00:08:42.919
Additionally, he gets stronger after the injection,
which confuses everyone in the room.

00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:47.370
After some time, Chase mutates; his body slowly
disfigures, and he turns violent.

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:50.889
His eyes turn red as if he is about to transfer
into something before Ford shoots him several

00:08:50.889 --> 00:08:51.889
times.

00:08:51.889 --> 00:08:55.430
Wafner then reveals that the serum can turn
dead soldiers into mutated ones, turning them

00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:56.430
zombie-like.

00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:59.850
As they discuss this, Chase gets up; before
he could attack anyone, Boyce knocks him to

00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:01.759
the ground and pounds his head to death.

00:09:01.759 --> 00:09:04.889
The commotion makes the perfect time for Wafner
to escape unnoticed.

00:09:04.889 --> 00:09:07.399
He comes down from the attic and grabs Paul
upon his exit.

00:09:07.399 --> 00:09:11.060
A group of German soldiers comes to his rescue
and takes Paul hostage.

00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:14.839
Chloe helplessly chases the army vehicle but
is unable to, so she runs to Boyce for some

00:09:14.839 --> 00:09:15.839
help.

00:09:15.839 --> 00:09:19.340
Willing to help Chloe get her brother back,
he refuses to follow orders from Ford, saying

00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:22.380
that their mission is more than just burning
the church tower but also putting an end to

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:24.009
the human experiments.

00:09:24.009 --> 00:09:27.100
Ford hesitantly agrees to the plan after being
assured by Boyce that he can lead the group

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:28.689
inside the church.&nbsp;

00:09:28.689 --> 00:09:30.610
&nbsp;
In the church, Wafner arrives with the little

00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:33.190
boy and rushes to the lab as their first stop.

00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:36.089
Thinking that it would heal his wounds in
an instant, Wafner injects the serum into

00:09:36.089 --> 00:09:38.129
him, despite the doctor stopping him.

00:09:38.129 --> 00:09:41.800
According to Dr. Schmidt, the serum has never
been injected into the living, uncertain of

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:42.880
the effects it would have on Wafner.

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:46.949
Wafner takes two doses of the serum and lets
out a hideous screech as his bones crack for

00:09:46.949 --> 00:09:48.100
no reason.

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:50.900
He reveals to the people in the room that
he has regained his strength, even though

00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:53.800
half of his face is blown off because of the
shootout earlier.

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:55.899
A sinister look comes from him without any
sign of pain.&nbsp;

00:09:55.899 --> 00:09:58.350
&nbsp;
Meanwhile, they plan their entrance to the

00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:00.470
church in a secluded part of the woods.

00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:03.379
They assign tasks to everyone who will split
up during their mission.

00:10:03.379 --> 00:10:07.810
To initiate it, Chloe shows herself to the
German soldiers, who chase her across town.

00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:11.800
They attempt to shoot her, but she successfully
runs through the forest, pursued by one soldier

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:13.129
to a nearby bridge.&nbsp;

00:10:13.129 --> 00:10:16.499
The soldier, thinking that he has cornered
Chloe, gets off his bike to physically attack

00:10:16.499 --> 00:10:18.079
and force himself on her.

00:10:18.079 --> 00:10:22.140
However, upon being beaten down to the ground,
Chloe lets out a laugh, then Ford knocks the

00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:23.259
soldier down.

00:10:23.259 --> 00:10:26.870
Next, they use the soldier that they strapped
with explosives to make their way into the

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:27.870
church.

00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:31.199
After the explosion injures several other
soldiers, Rosenfeld and Tibbet launch a frontal

00:10:31.199 --> 00:10:35.269
assault as a distraction, while Ford, Boyce,
and Chloe enter the base using the sewers.&nbsp;

00:10:35.269 --> 00:10:37.220
&nbsp;
This causes a massive commotion inside the

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:41.459
base, as the soldiers are alerted that they
are under attack by a small group of Americans.

00:10:41.459 --> 00:10:45.480
Inside, Boyce and Ford carry out their mission
to rig the place, while Chloe refuses to wait

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:47.069
and runs to look for Paul.

00:10:47.069 --> 00:10:50.860
In a hallway, she holds two soldiers at gunpoint
and shoots one of them after failing to disclose

00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:52.300
her brother's whereabouts.

00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:55.990
The group’s intentions become more desperate,
resulting in them acting more violently toward

00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:56.990
their enemy.

00:10:56.990 --> 00:11:00.600
In the communication room, Ford stabs a soldier
in the neck from behind to set timers as part

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:02.370
of the plan to blow up the place.

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:05.860
Underground, the soldier brings Chloe to the
dens to mislead her that her brother is in

00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:06.860
there.

00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:09.790
He opens a cell, and she finds half a body
lying on the floor.

00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:13.629
Luckily, Boyce gets to Chloe before she gets
shot by the German soldier.

00:11:13.629 --> 00:11:17.320
Upon leaving, they see the zombie drag the
soldier inside the cell to devour him.

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:20.579
Both of them could not fathom what they saw,
but with time as their enemy, they rushed

00:11:20.579 --> 00:11:22.240
to continue to find Paul.

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:26.250
As discreet as possible, they make it to the
lab, where after some time, Paul calls for

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:27.420
Chloe’s name.

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:29.860
She reunites with her brother, and they find
their way to the exit.

00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:33.379
However, a mutated zombie drags Chloe back
into the room.

00:11:33.379 --> 00:11:36.779
Paul escapes back to the village while Chloe
distracts the zombie, shooting and fighting

00:11:36.779 --> 00:11:37.779
it.

00:11:37.779 --> 00:11:40.680
She manages to hit it after being attacked
by it, but the wounds seem ineffective to

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:41.889
slow it down.

00:11:41.889 --> 00:11:45.700
The zombie chases her across the hallway,
but she eventually finds one of the flamethrowers

00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:47.570
and burns the zombie to death with it.&nbsp;

00:11:47.570 --> 00:11:50.259
&nbsp;
Wafner, now mutated and possessing superhuman

00:11:50.259 --> 00:11:53.600
strength, discovers Ford planting explosives
in the radio tower.

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:55.899
He knocks him down and is planning something
sinister.

00:11:55.899 --> 00:11:59.680
Meanwhile, as Boyce plants explosives in the
central part of the lab, Dr. Schmidt holds

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:01.850
a gun to his head and orders him to follow
his orders.

00:12:01.850 --> 00:12:05.720
But, with all his strength, he attacks the
doctor back, and they have a brawl.

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:09.199
Dr. Schmidt attempts to knife Boyce, but he
is unsuccessful and gets killed instead.&nbsp;

00:12:09.199 --> 00:12:11.839
&nbsp;
Chloe returns to the village, where Tibbet

00:12:11.839 --> 00:12:15.259
and Rosenfeld have been pursued and pinned
down by the base's defenders.

00:12:15.259 --> 00:12:18.990
The shootout lasts for some time until Paul
runs into the middle of the battlegrounds.

00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:22.370
Out of concern for the young boy's safety,
Tibbet is wounded while shielding Paul from

00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:23.370
gunfire.

00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:27.540
Finally, he safely brings Paul back to a shielded
area, as Chloe ambushes and kills the remaining

00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:29.779
Germans and treats Tibbet's wounds.

00:12:29.779 --> 00:12:31.990
&nbsp;
In another part of the base, Wafner overpowers

00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:35.220
Ford, who he throws around the room before
impaling him on a meat hook.

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:38.490
He reveals to Ford that the serum was made
by using the villagers' bodies to distill

00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:42.390
the ancient power of the black tar, which
had been running under the village for centuries.

00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:46.170
The experiments aim to create immortal and
invincible soldiers to serve Germany’s mission.

00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:49.890
Boyce, who had previously finished planting
explosives in the laboratory, ambushes Wafner

00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:51.879
but gets thrown away across the room.

00:12:51.879 --> 00:12:55.470
The zombie-like Wafner opens compartments
that contain bodies of fallen soldiers injected

00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:56.629
with the serum.

00:12:56.629 --> 00:12:59.930
In the middle of this, Ford pulls himself
off the meat hook and injects himself with

00:12:59.930 --> 00:13:02.629
a dose of the serum to heal his wounds instantly.

00:13:02.629 --> 00:13:07.190
Aware of the consequences, he sacrifices himself
to stop Wafner and stab him from behind.

00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:10.129
Both of them recklessly fight each other as
their bodies continue to disfigure in the

00:13:10.129 --> 00:13:11.220
process.

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:15.009
Although Ford cannot defeat him, he manages
to roll an oxygen tank to Wafner's feet, which

00:13:15.009 --> 00:13:19.350
Boyce then shoots; the explosion sends Wafner
falling into the tar pit right at that moment.

00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:22.550
Boyce approaches their leader to help him
get up, but Ford locks himself inside upon

00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:24.060
passing by the exit.

00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:27.449
He orders Boyce to leave him behind and detonate
the explosives in the tower, believing neither

00:13:27.449 --> 00:13:29.399
side should possess the serum.

00:13:29.399 --> 00:13:33.249
After some convincing, Boyce follows his instructions
just before Ford sets off the explosives in

00:13:33.249 --> 00:13:37.449
the lab, killing himself, the other zombies,
and Wafner, who had mutated further and climbed

00:13:37.449 --> 00:13:38.989
out of the tar pit.&nbsp;

00:13:38.989 --> 00:13:40.839
&nbsp;
Boyce sets a timer on the explosives and escapes

00:13:40.839 --> 00:13:44.139
in the communications room as the church and
jamming tower collapse behind him, burying

00:13:44.139 --> 00:13:46.240
the laboratory and the rest of the building.

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:49.519
The rest of the villagers gather outside as
the radio announces the victory of the allied

00:13:49.519 --> 00:13:50.959
forces in the war.

00:13:50.959 --> 00:13:54.999
Boyce reunites with Tibbet, Rosenfeld, Chloe,
and Paul in the village and sadly informs

00:13:54.999 --> 00:13:56.829
them that Ford did not make it.

00:13:56.829 --> 00:14:00.100
After the action wears off gradually, Boyce
reports to a commanding officer about the

00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:01.100
mission.

00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:03.470
He credits Ford for being the reason for their
success.

00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:07.069
The commanding officer asks Boyce about rumors
of an underground lab in the church.

00:14:07.069 --> 00:14:10.740
Boyce, sharing Ford's view, denies seeing
anything worth digging up.

00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:14.369
He now believes that the zombies and the human
experiments should be kept unknown, or else

00:14:14.369 --> 00:14:16.990
more people will suffer the same fate as failed
test subjects.&nbsp;
