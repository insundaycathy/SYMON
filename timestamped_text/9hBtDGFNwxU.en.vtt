00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.880
imagine you are transformed into a monster&nbsp;
suddenly the only way to survive is eaten human&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:10.000
flesh if that isn't bad enough you are caught up&nbsp;
in the middle of an ongoing war between humans&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.360
and ghouls how would you manage to stay alive&nbsp;
and beat your new enemies kaneki is sitting in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.320
a cafe enjoying his egg sandwich with a friend&nbsp;
of his they talk about the ghoul activity in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.840
neighborhood and asked themselves if they by any&nbsp;
chance had ever met any it is virtually impossible&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:31.520
to identify a ghoul with your eyes only they look&nbsp;
like us they dress like us and they talk like us&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:37.120
nothing about them stands out apart from&nbsp;
cannibalism of course they joke about how pretty&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.720
much everyone around them at this moment could&nbsp;
be one we all know where this is going both of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:48.240
our characters live in ward number 20. wards are&nbsp;
pretty much districts that are named after numbers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:53.520
there are 24 of them and while ward 1 is where&nbsp;
the head government is located our story plays&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.200
out in war 20 which is much farther away of course&nbsp;
according to this logic the most secure areas are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:04.640
naturally those that are closer to ward number one&nbsp;
so the farther away you get from the center the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.920
more dangerous it gets and the more likely you are&nbsp;
prone to any ghoul attacks this fact alone would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:15.440
either convince me to board an airplane and bye&nbsp;
bye or at least move into one of the inner circles&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:21.440
especially if i plan to build a family and have a&nbsp;
stable life because yes i would like that i really&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.560
don't want to brief my kids every day before they&nbsp;
take the school bus about possible ghoul threats&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:33.040
of course for ghouls the opposite is the case&nbsp;
technically speaking if you're all about slinging&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:38.800
dope and crack you may too want to stay somewhere&nbsp;
further away from ward 1. kaneki's crush suddenly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:45.280
steps into the cafe he loses it and we understand&nbsp;
that our boy kaneki here has to step up his game

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.400
the secretary type huh to each his own bro&nbsp;
he eloquently stutters his way through his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:02.240
interaction making me more uncomfortable than&nbsp;
himself through some unknown mystery he achieves&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:08.320
scoring a date now to me as a spectator this is&nbsp;
already a pretty big red flag this is what i mean&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:13.280
ghouls can't be identified easily so why would&nbsp;
you want to meet any stranger somewhere on your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:19.040
own that just seems stupid to me you can't really&nbsp;
shouldn't trust anyone if you like being alive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.600
it doesn't mean you can't go on dates or meet&nbsp;
new people but you just must be extra cautious&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.880
and prepare safety nets ahead telling your family&nbsp;
and friends that you go out with someone is just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:34.320
a standard baseline here having backup nearby or&nbsp;
functional firearms is pretty much the only way to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:40.240
keep yourself safe unless of course you are a goal&nbsp;
denier in which case stay away from me i think it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.560
would be great if the government cooperated with&nbsp;
citizens to ensure their safety when they end up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:54.080
meeting strangers not running away while knowing&nbsp;
you're super socially awkward is something only&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.800
the bravest among us can do seriously someone give&nbsp;
this man a friendly pet on his shoulder that was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:04.240
pretty insane i would have died to improve your&nbsp;
errors you must venture out and face your fears&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:09.200
that's just how this th*t works however can we&nbsp;
please not ignore that this woman is not eating&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:15.360
her freaking food why not isn't she hungry why did&nbsp;
she order something in the first place huh this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.000
the first big red flag that i cannot comprehend&nbsp;
how he could overlook that yet kaneki doesn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.040
seem to be aware of it so either he's a major&nbsp;
simp and his pp is currently hijacking his brain&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.920
or he's just clueless about ghouls in general&nbsp;
in my opinion if you live in a ghoul infected&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.800
area you should educate yourself you should find&nbsp;
out how they work so you can identify the signs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.520
if you come across any at least in theory that&nbsp;
way you would have known about their aversion&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:45.840
to human food and this untouched plate of two&nbsp;
magnificent sandwiches would ring the bells

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.280
walking home in darkness might not be&nbsp;
the ideal way to move around either&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.680
i personally wouldn't take the risk before having&nbsp;
taken appropriate measures especially since&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.880
my date didn't freaking touch your food before&nbsp;
actually you know what chances are very high i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:10.400
would pretend to receive a call from my imaginary&nbsp;
dying mother leave straight away dye my hair get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.760
fake glasses and either indulge in a hikimori&nbsp;
lifestyle or just become a freaking hermit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:21.440
turns out that the girl he went on a date is&nbsp;
a freaking ghoul there you go what a surprise&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:26.480
he gets bitten and almost eaten in the process he&nbsp;
doesn't stand a chance when she's about to finish&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:33.280
him off he is saved by random construction side&nbsp;
pillars raining down onto her why not right now if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:38.400
you think he is safe it couldn't be farther from&nbsp;
the truth when he wakes up in the local hospital&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:44.480
he is told that he has received a bunch of new&nbsp;
organs transplanted from Ritsu's body which was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:50.400
the secretary ghoul from before this doesn't sound&nbsp;
very appealing to me would you accept to receive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:55.840
organs of someone who is a murderer or a rapist&nbsp;
let me know what you think in the comments a few&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:01.680
weeks pass and he eventually recovers he goes back&nbsp;
to school and is about to pick up his life again&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:07.120
he doesn't really have an alternative especially&nbsp;
since he is an orphan and has nobody but himself&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.320
when he is about to have lunch with&nbsp;
his friend this is what happens

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:20.480
i love how they decided to use this amazing&nbsp;
looking food to depict the change he goes through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:26.240
he can't eat it for the love of god even if he&nbsp;
wanted to he just can't so there are really just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.880
two options here either this dish is one of those&nbsp;
dishes that looks like it comes from heaven but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:36.080
tastes like wet paper or perhaps he morphs&nbsp;
into a ghoul he doesn't seem to understand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:41.440
what's going on at first after all it could be&nbsp;
brain damage that changed his sense of taste&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:46.160
at home he pretty much eats himself through his&nbsp;
complete fridge just to make sure meanwhile in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:51.040
background though the tv is on where a ghoul&nbsp;
specialist is having his 15 seconds of fame&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:58.320
he explains that to ghouls human food tastes like&nbsp;
foul stuff in fact everything tastes so incredibly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:03.600
terrible to them they can't eat anything else&nbsp;
but human flesh meaning if they want to survive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:08.880
they must eat humans which of course is a direct&nbsp;
threat to humanity and therefore a big problem&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:14.800
that is why the commission of counter ghoul exists&nbsp;
but later more to them kaneki is in trouble but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:19.920
what would you do in his place if you were to&nbsp;
switch positions with him right now how would you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:25.280
proceed i think it is safe to say that he is very&nbsp;
lucky not to have any immediate family members&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:29.840
he wouldn't be missed by anyone if he suddenly&nbsp;
disappeared or decided to stay low-key for the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:35.600
time being which by the way i think is the best&nbsp;
way to go for now if this was me i would probably&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:40.880
take a few days off just to let that sink in i&nbsp;
would carefully contemplate and come to terms&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:47.120
with the fact that my previous life is over period&nbsp;
the psychological change can't be made in a day&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:52.480
it must be a step-by-step process anything else&nbsp;
would be madness believe me but our dear kaneki&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:58.800
here decides a slightly different tactic okay&nbsp;
what he does is he leaves his home walks through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:04.560
shibuya licks his fingers like a freaking crazy&nbsp;
mother-#%"+ç and stares at young women passing by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:10.800
yeah i mean why not right eventually he comes&nbsp;
across another ghoul who is feasting on a dead&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:16.560
person he learns quickly that ghouls aren't much&nbsp;
team players everyone has his corner and if you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:21.920
invade it you better prepare to put up a fight&nbsp;
kaneki is safe by another ghoul turns out that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:27.040
she belongs to Anteiku an organization that aids&nbsp;
the stranded ghouls sort of like the sole society&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:32.480
for spirits in bleach they have their base in war&nbsp;
20 and overlook the situation here they don't kill&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:38.560
other humans but rather pick up dead bodies at&nbsp;
famous suicide sites it's a pretty smart move and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:44.000
probably pretty eco-friendly too kaneki ends up&nbsp;
there too i can't really blame him his whole life&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.640
got turned upside down and he didn't eat&nbsp;
anything ever since he turned into a ghoul&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:52.800
when he is brought to them which by the way&nbsp;
is in the same cafe where he first had his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:58.640
egg sandwich he gets to know quite a bit of&nbsp;
what it means to be a ghoul for example coffee&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:03.920
apparently drinking coffee is the only thing&nbsp;
apart from human flesh that they can consume&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:09.680
if i were one of them i would run an underground&nbsp;
lab and create human coffee toffees how about that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:15.520
selling ghoul candy in 2021 even though kaneki has&nbsp;
found this place he is not yet ready to leave his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:20.880
old life behind he still goes to school how about&nbsp;
that jesus i guess that's what he called japanese&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:26.320
diligence at school he surprisingly meets the same&nbsp;
ghoul that has almost killed him a few days ago&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:31.120
instead of trying to escape he and his&nbsp;
friend get involved in a pretty heavy battle&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:36.000
it looks pretty hopeless but when kaneki sees&nbsp;
his friend almost being killed his real powers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.040
awaken and for the first time in this movie i&nbsp;
feel like i'm actually seeing a real monster he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:46.240
eventually defeats the four-eyed dude and almost&nbsp;
ends up eating his friend himself but before he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:51.920
can start snacking on him he gets taken by Anteiku&nbsp;
and they bring him back to their headquarters to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:58.080
be fair this is exactly the thing that happens if&nbsp;
you deny your real self you go crazy once he had&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:03.360
turned into a ghoul kaneki should have gone into&nbsp;
a two-week vipassana meditation retreat he would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:08.400
have been the first buddhist ghoul and possibly&nbsp;
even the first self-development ghoultuber&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:13.600
at this point however after his only friend has&nbsp;
almost died he finally comes to terms with the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:19.200
circumstances and tries to adjust his lifestyle&nbsp;
in my opinion this is the best time to educate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:24.800
yourself you've almost been killed your friend&nbsp;
too you have zero idea how things work therefore&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:30.560
you should sit down take a pen and paper and start&nbsp;
listening exactly what those schools have to say&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:35.680
they have all the answers you may want to know of&nbsp;
course he doesn't but he is offered a job which i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:40.640
guess is some progress i guess this is exactly&nbsp;
what he needs at this point he is quickly told&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:45.280
that being a ghoul comes along with many new&nbsp;
problems Anteiku is currently hiding a mother&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:50.480
and her daughter whose father has been killed by&nbsp;
the CCG a few weeks ago they aren't safe and are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:56.160
in need to change their identities and escape ward&nbsp;
20. the CCG is actively trying to find them they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:56.160 --> 00:10:02.160
consist of human agents that have special means to&nbsp;
identify and kill ghouls ghouls possess something&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:07.440
sort of like tails or wings like we've seen before&nbsp;
they are called kagune and they're made of special&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:12.880
cells that can harden in an instant by using the&nbsp;
sac organ of a ghoul that forms the Kagune the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:17.680
agents have found a way to manufacture weapons&nbsp;
called quinque with those weapons they attain&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:22.560
similar strength like ghouls and are very capable&nbsp;
in taking ghoul's heads on kaneki the ghoul&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:27.840
barista is having a good time at Anteiku and to be&nbsp;
honest it looks like a very healthy place to be at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:33.040
in fact it seems to be healthier than some human&nbsp;
institutions at least in my opinion eventually&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:38.720
immature is enough so that he can finally order&nbsp;
his custom-made personal ken kaneki cosplay mask&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:45.280
yes the idea behind the gold mask is pretty simple&nbsp;
keep your human identity safe while being in ghoul&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:50.880
form it's a counter measure to prevent the CCG&nbsp;
to identify you i think that's pretty neat way&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:56.800
to prevent exposure but it wouldn't be enough for&nbsp;
me if i were the head of Anteiku i would franchise&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:02.720
this cafe having a ghoul run cafe network across&nbsp;
war 20 and perhaps even further would provide&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:08.160
us with the security and information we need to&nbsp;
establish a safe haven for every goal abide into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:15.440
our rules instead of poke centers think in a way&nbsp;
of ghoul cafes members must follow two rules first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:21.280
don't kill any humans and second don't let the&nbsp;
organization be exposed if we are able to expand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:26.320
in that way there is no question that ghouls&nbsp;
will be able to exist with an increasing sense&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:32.320
of security meanwhile the CCG is planning their&nbsp;
next move it seems like they have identified the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:37.280
woman and her daughter that are currently residing&nbsp;
in the cafe when he spends time with the ghoul&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:42.560
girl they establish a friendship she convinces&nbsp;
him to drop off a gift at the place where her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:47.840
father has been killed i mean i like the idea of&nbsp;
that but i don't think this is a very good idea&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:52.880
they might not know how kaneki looks but seeing a&nbsp;
stranger wearing an eye patch at midnight dropping&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:58.960
something off hidden in a white tissue is pretty&nbsp;
suspicious pretty much everywhere in this world&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:03.840
how about you just wait until the next day when&nbsp;
the park is filled with dozens of kids screaming&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:08.720
around and being annoying or even better wait&nbsp;
until those two ghoul refugees have left this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:14.880
ward first full 15 seconds later the CCG agents&nbsp;
appear and start digging like dogs trying to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:20.560
cover their sh*t great i smell trouble they find&nbsp;
the possessions of that father and are able to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:26.560
identify their mother wonderful burying highly&nbsp;
confidential items in a public park is probably&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:32.640
not the best way to go my friends especially when&nbsp;
you belong to a race that is notoriously alienated&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:37.520
if you are serious about your security and&nbsp;
well-being maybe you should burn anything capable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:43.200
of blowing up your security if you for some reason&nbsp;
are an extremely religious ghoul you could for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:47.760
example bribe a graveyard manager and establish a&nbsp;
tomb with a fake name on it where you can worship&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:53.040
the deceased i wouldn't recommend it but you know&nbsp;
if this is what you're into go for it the next day&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:58.160
when the two refugees are finally leaving this&nbsp;
ward it doesn't go as smooth as planned who knew&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:03.360
i'm grateful for Anteiku for having taken care&nbsp;
of them so well but how about escorting them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:09.040
until they are out of reach sending them off&nbsp;
at your doorstep seems a little bit lazy to me&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:14.480
only a few minutes pass and they are indeed&nbsp;
attacked by two agents yes great the girl&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:19.440
is able to escape but her mother stays back to&nbsp;
fight kaneki eventually comes but doesn't join&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:24.560
the fight because he would be pretty useless he&nbsp;
hasn't learned how to fight yet in fact he has no&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:30.160
idea what power ghouls actually possess all they&nbsp;
can do is watch and again this could have been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:35.680
prevented if kaneki wasn't a complete idiot the&nbsp;
night before in any way this is how it turned out

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:46.480
i really liked this character but we can't&nbsp;
really blame any of the involved parties here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:50.240
i mean humans try to protect&nbsp;
themselves and ghouls try to survive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:54.800
it is just the case that ghouls and humans&nbsp;
are natural enemies nothing can change that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:54.800 --> 00:14:00.320
as long as ghouls kill and eat humans humans&nbsp;
will try to prevent that the only hope i see for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:06.160
ghouls to escape extinction is franchising the&nbsp;
killing of her didn't sit well with the others&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:10.880
Touka one of the Anteiku members ventures&nbsp;
out to pay back the debts nothing can stop&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:16.320
her and i really don't mind seeing a sexy ghoul&nbsp;
girl wearing a bunny mask murdering some humans&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:21.360
but to be serious for a second vengeance doesn't&nbsp;
solve the problem here in fact every kill will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:27.280
further intensify the issues the only solution&nbsp;
apart from franchising Anteiku cafes across Tokyo&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:32.960
would be to either kill all humans and establish&nbsp;
complete ghoul rule or kill all ghouls and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:43.840
re-establish the humans as apex or talk it out&nbsp;
make agreements and see if those can be upheld

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:51.680
kaneki is fed up so far he hasn't been much&nbsp;
helpful this is partly his fault so i can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:57.360
completely understand his frustration i think&nbsp;
it's time for some action he finally decides&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:02.400
to get some training and what could be better&nbsp;
than getting hands-on combat training from toka&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:06.800
here are the training scenes i don't really have&nbsp;
much to say here but i need to say something&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:11.600
to fill in the void so while i'm talking&nbsp;
nonsense i hope you can enjoy those epic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:16.320
matrix x dragon ball fight scenes that&nbsp;
will turn kaneki into the new apex ghoul&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:22.400
in one week and then when the time finally comes&nbsp;
and he has attained zeno's level ghoul strength&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:26.640
he will finally for the love&nbsp;
of god wear his goddamn mask

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:39.040
this is the moment we've all been waiting for time&nbsp;
to kick some ass our young ghoul kid gets tricked&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:44.000
into a trap which in my opinion was absolutely&nbsp;
predictable if you can't catch the big fish go&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:49.600
for the small one instead it's a sh*t move but it&nbsp;
does work they cut off an arm of her mother and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:54.080
placed it at the same place where she was killed&nbsp;
making it seem like she has returned which of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:54.080 --> 00:16:00.160
course is a complete lie Touka and kaneki go for&nbsp;
rescue they both get involved in separate battles&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:05.440
kaneki is able to pull out his new attain jackie&nbsp;
chan moves and disables his opponent quite quickly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:10.880
we get some nice slo-mo shots and finally&nbsp;
a very satisfying final strike of our boy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:16.240
ken kaneki we all know how it feels like&nbsp;
to take the first bite of our favorite meal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:21.360
but he takes it to another level meanwhile&nbsp;
Touka is fighting on a picturesque riverside&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:27.280
lucky girl although her opponent is much stronger&nbsp;
than kaneki's she's struggling quite a bit but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:32.480
luckily the little ghoul girl behind awakens&nbsp;
her kagune and cuts off every limb of that agent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:37.680
i guess a bunch of kagune is&nbsp;
all you need thanks for watching
