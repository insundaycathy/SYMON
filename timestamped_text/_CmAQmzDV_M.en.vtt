00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.860
Hello everyone, this is Mr. Brain Junkie here!

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:07.369
And Today we'll be talking about a science
fiction film called Pacific Rim Uprising!

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:09.510
Be ready for some spoilers ahead!

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.920
10 years ago, the human race was attacked
by giant monsters called Kaijus, when a breach

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.050
was opened up by an alien civilization called
the Precursors.

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.310
Humanity is forced to build their own monsters
in the form of giant machines called Yeagers,

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.519
in order to protect the species from total
annihilation.

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.109
In the final battles, a human commander in
the name of Staker Pentacost blew up his own

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.830
Yeager to save the human race, finally closing
the breach and stopping the war.

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:40.200
Most of humanity eventually recovered from
the invasions, but few of the costal cities

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.440
are still struggling due to the pollutions
from the monster's blood.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.310
Unlike his father Staker who's a war hero,
Jake is a petty thief who works along side

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:51.580
the criminals to steal Yeager technology from
the government.

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:55.260
When the group finally makes it into the heart
of the machine, they are surprised to find

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.070
that it's power core is missing, already stolen
by someone else.

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.710
Luckily, Jake is able to trace the signals
and evade the police, eventually arriving

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.760
inside an abandoned factory where he sees
a miniature Yeager that was built from scraps.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.910
Before he can finish admiring the machine,
the man is attacked by the Yeager's builder,

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:17.720
but quickly gains the upper hand as the attacker
turns out to be a young girl called Amara.

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.990
Jake is overjoyed by his luck of finding this
goldmine and plans to sell everything here

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.550
despite the girl's protest, but they are quickly
interrupted by the approaching sirens,

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.240
as the police have followed them towards the
warehouse.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.590
Amara immediately runs into her Yeager that
she named Scrapper and turns on the giant

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.150
machine, planning to escape from this place,

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.100
but Jake also climbs into the robot, demanding
to be the pilot instead.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.320
The girl refuses to listen and breaks out
from the building's walls, running away from

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.700
the soldiers and thinking that she's escaped.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:52.190
However, her celebration is interrupted by
a massive Yeager in the name of November Ajax,

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.280
who demands that they power down and surrender
immediately.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.890
Amara raises her hands and appears to give
up, but fires multiple grenades onto the ground

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.860
that releases a field of gas, hiding their
locations and giving them a chance to run.

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.330
The miniature Yeager transforms into a ball
and rolls away from the pursuer, eventually

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.410
jumping into a building, as they try to hide
from the giant machine.

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.660
Realizing that they can't stay here forever,
Jake proposes a risky plan as they grab onto

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.290
the arm of November Ajax and climbs onto the
Yeager's head,

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.030
dropping one of their batteries and stunning
the opponent using electricity.

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.280
Amara takes the chance and tries to run away
while the power of their Yeager drops quickly,

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.490
but soon gets knocked over by November Ajax,
as the Giant robot has recovered already.

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.690
She tries to escape desperately but their
pursuer decides to end this ridiculous chase

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.459
and tasers them using electrical wires,

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:44.959
finally stopping the outlaws as the girl shouts
furiously at her captor.

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:49.800
They are taken into a holding cell and Jake
is offered to meet a high ranking officer,

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.760
who turns out to be Mako, his adopted sister.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.620
She's very disappointed at Jake for his behaviors
and reveals that the man used to be a pilot

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.819
for the Yeagers but eventually quit and chose
to be a criminal instead.

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:06.750
In order to avoid prison, Mako offers Jake
a final choice to return to the academy so

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.349
that he can help train the younger generations,
including Amara.

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:15.340
They arrive in the piloting school on a remote
island of China, and they meet Lambert, a

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.690
ranger and former associate of Jake.

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.870
The man has a very low opinion of the main
character, and mocks him for choosing crime

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.000
instead of the military.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.069
They head towards the headquarters and the
girl is amazed by the collection of Yeagers

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:31.950
in the facility, including Titan Redeemer
and it's giant spinning ball of death.

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.709
There's also Bracer Phoenix that's piloted
by three people, and Saber Athena, the fastest

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:38.650
Yeager known to man kind.

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:43.209
Last but not least, they are introduced to
the machine which Lambert pilots, the Gypsy

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:45.040
Avenger and it's massive nuclear core.

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.410
They arrive inside the facility for the cadets,
and Amara meets her teammates that she'll

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:50.690
be training together with,

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.659
but has a hard time being accepted due to
her criminal backgrounds.

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:58.820
What's even worse, her training goes very
poorly as she continuously gets defeated by

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:03.240
the simulations, due to her poor capabilities
of piloting with the others.

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:07.379
Her underwhelming performance makes her look
even worse in front of her teammates, and

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:10.319
Lambert question why she's even chosen to
be here.

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:15.291
At the same time, the owner of Shao Industries,
Liwen has arrived to the base as well, along

00:04:15.291 --> 00:04:18.260
side with Mako and their leading scientist,
Doctor Newton.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:23.000
They present the military leaders with their
new inventions, which includes automated Yeagers

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.620
that can be deployed much faster than the
ones with humans inside.

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:31.080
This would also skip the tedious processes
of training pilots, which can save the military

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.240
a lot of time and resources.

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.970
However, many are not happy with the woman's
proposal as the automation of Yeagers would

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:39.940
also render the pilots useless.

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:44.660
Mako is also very skeptical about this new
technology as she believes that it's vulnerable

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:49.610
to hackers, potentially causing more harm
than good if it falls into the wrong hands.

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.700
This is why she plans to vote against the
company in the council summits, and She wants

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:57.449
her Brother to accompany her as guard of honor
inside Gypsy Avenger,

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:00.130
making sure that no riots would take place.

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:04.759
Very soon, they arrive at the council summit
in Australia, and Gypsy Avenger is brought

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:08.270
towards the people with Jake and Lambert inside
as the pilots.

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:12.190
The planes drop the giant machine right in
front of the protestors, and Jake struggles

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:15.700
to keep balance, being rusty from years of
absence.

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:20.050
Mako arrives as well inside a helicopter,
but they soon begin to sense that something

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:24.360
is wrong as all the birds are flying towards
them, as if they are running away from something

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.360
big.

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:30.070
Suddenly, a large Yeager called Obsidian Fury
jumps out from the oceans and rushes towards

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:34.940
land, completely disregarding the civilians
below as everyone tries to run for their lives.

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:39.520
The rogue machine shoots directly at the helicopter,
barely missing the target as the missiles

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.530
continue toward Gypsy Avenger,

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:45.880
but Jake is able to dodge the attack in the
last moment, causing huge explosions on the

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:47.300
buildings behind.

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:51.840
The helipad on the skyscraper is knocked off
and falls quickly towards the people below,

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:55.360
but Gypsy is able to catch the massive concrete
just in time,

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.030
saving Liwen and all the civilians beside
her.

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:02.930
At the same time, Mako discovered something
familiar about the enemy's power signature,

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:04.419
trying to warn Jake on the radio,

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:09.509
but Obsidian Fury is able to jam the signals
nearby, terminating all the communications

00:06:09.509 --> 00:06:10.509
in the area.

00:06:10.509 --> 00:06:15.220
While the Yeager is distracted, Gypsy Avenger
throws the Helipad towards the enemy's head

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:16.960
and charges in to attack,

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:21.270
but the opponent quickly counters by knocking
them backwards into a building, and landing

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:24.560
a devastating uppercut that sends them flying
into the air.

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:29.660
Obsidian Fury continues to pummel Gypsy as
it throws the Yeager around like a ragdoll,

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:34.150
crashing the robot into the buildings and
knocking them away by using a powerful blast.

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:38.290
Gypsy manages to recover from the attack and
takes out the sword from it's arsenal, but

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:43.120
the enemy is able to out weapon them with
two blades, and slashes at them furiously.

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:47.030
Gypsy struggles to avoid the attacks while
getting completely dominated by it's opponent

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:49.270
as it gets punched around continuously.

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:53.940
The enemy eventually misses one of the attacks
and slashes downwards into a building, giving

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:59.460
Gypsy Avenger the chance to strike using it's
elbow rocket that sends the enemy flying backwards.

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:04.580
However, Obsidian quickly counters by using
it's missiles again, causing huge explosions

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:08.270
on the buildings nearby and hitting the helicopter
that Mako is in,

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:10.420
sending the woman crashing towards the ground.

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:14.530
Seeing that his sister is in trouble, Jake
decides to use their most powerful weapon

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:16.780
that levitates numerous cars in the air,

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:21.010
and launches them onto Obsidian Fury using
tremendous force that knocks the enemy onto

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:22.090
the ground.

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:26.210
Gypsy turns around immediately and rushes
towards the falling chopper, trying desperately

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:28.840
to save Mako and all the soldiers on board.

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:33.259
In the last moment, the woman is able to send
a message to the headquarters as she sees

00:07:33.259 --> 00:07:36.169
her brother jumping towards her using all
his might,

00:07:36.169 --> 00:07:40.810
but eventually fails to catch the helicopter
as it crashes down onto the ground and explodes

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:42.370
into a million pieces.

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:47.270
Jake sees the explosions and shouts for Mako's
name, running desperately towards the fires,

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:49.639
and refusing to accept his sister's death.

00:07:49.639 --> 00:07:54.460
Obsidian Fury walks towards the fallen Gypsy,
trying to finish the kill, but soon realizes

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:59.910
that other Yeagers are closing by and chooses
to run away quickly, vanishing into the oceans.

00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:04.669
Jake is greatly affected by his sister's death
as he sees her picture on the hall of heroes,

00:08:04.669 --> 00:08:08.639
but the man has little time to mourn as he
gets called to the meeting regarding Mako's

00:08:08.639 --> 00:08:09.639
message.

00:08:09.639 --> 00:08:13.690
Apparently, they are able to receive part
of the transmission despite the signal jam

00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:17.190
and Doctor Hermann is able to reconstruct
the informations,

00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:22.449
ending up with a GPS location of a decommissioned
Yeager manufacturing facility is Siberia.

00:08:22.449 --> 00:08:26.590
Jake decides to head there right away, as
he wishes nothing more than to avenger Mako's

00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:29.850
death and find out the real culprit behind
the attacks.

00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:34.329
Meanwhile, Shao Industries has been granted
full permission to deploy their drones especially

00:08:34.329 --> 00:08:36.879
after the battle in the council summits.

00:08:36.879 --> 00:08:41.769
Liwen orders Newton to prepare all their yeagers
for deployment within 2 days, while all the

00:08:41.769 --> 00:08:44.559
giant machine are being assembled in the massive
factory.

00:08:44.559 --> 00:08:49.550
The doctor goes home after a long day of work,
and begins talking with his imaginary girlfriend,

00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:52.660
which turns out to be a kaiju's brain that
he calls Alice.

00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:56.739
The man proceeds to join his mind with the
alien creature, suggesting that this has been

00:08:56.739 --> 00:08:58.820
going on for a very long time.

00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:03.480
On the other side, Gypsy Avenger has arrived
in front of the decommissioned Yeager facility

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:07.930
in Siberia, and begins finding some strange
reading on their radars.

00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:12.040
Suddenly, numerous missiles are launched towards
them, landing hits on the yeager and destroying

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:15.540
the facility as the buildings are consumed
by the explosions.

00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:20.290
It turns out that Obsidian Fury has followed
them here as well, and Gypsy immediately charges

00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:21.449
towards the enemy,

00:09:21.449 --> 00:09:25.610
tackling the giant robot to the ground and
punching it continuous as they fall into a

00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:26.700
massive cliff.

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:31.079
The two yeagers crash out from the ice mountains
and lands on the ground, but Obsidian Fury

00:09:31.079 --> 00:09:35.610
is able to recover quickly and fires a powerful
laser beam from it's chest,

00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:38.970
forcing Gypsy into a defense and destroying
everything nearby.

00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:43.360
With no other choice, Jake decides to evade
the attack by breaking the ice underneath,

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:46.300
allowing Gypsy to escape from being blown
to pieces.

00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:51.050
Obsidian walks towards the giant hole to examine
the opponent, only to see a missile fly out

00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:55.850
from underneath and as it heads towards the
yeager, knocking it inside the water as well.

00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:59.879
Gypsy takes the chance and charges at the
enemy, tackling Obsidian towards the surface

00:09:59.879 --> 00:10:01.799
and finally gains the upper hand.

00:10:01.799 --> 00:10:06.540
The yeager uses the plasma cannon and fires
at the opponent, knocking Obsidian backwards

00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:11.569
as it tumbles across field, but it did not
take long before the enemy recovers once again.

00:10:11.569 --> 00:10:15.709
The two giant machines run towards each other
welding their swords and Gypsy manages to

00:10:15.709 --> 00:10:19.709
evade the attacks while slashing the at the
opponent, cutting Obsidian right across the

00:10:19.709 --> 00:10:20.709
chest.

00:10:20.709 --> 00:10:24.889
Seeing that the enemy's hurt, Gypsy charges
in for the kill by hitting the opponent multiple

00:10:24.889 --> 00:10:28.100
times, eventually managing to overpower Obsidian.

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:32.660
The yeager punches a hole in the enemy's chest,
taking out it's power core and finally ending

00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:35.779
the fight, as the giant robot falls towards
the ground.

00:10:35.779 --> 00:10:39.769
Gypsy walks towards the fallen yeager and
rips open it's control hub, only to see that

00:10:39.769 --> 00:10:43.129
there's no one inside except for something
that resembles a brain.

00:10:43.129 --> 00:10:47.410
They take the remains back to the headquarters
and Doctor Hermann is able to confirm that

00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:50.769
the organic specimens are very similar to
Kaiju brains.

00:10:50.769 --> 00:10:55.319
what's different is that these materials have
no signs of radiations from the other universe,

00:10:55.319 --> 00:10:57.929
suggesting that they are engineered by humans.

00:10:57.929 --> 00:11:02.230
Furthermore, after examining the inner structure
of the Yeager, the team found that many of

00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:05.319
the technologies are very similar to Shao
Industries'.

00:11:05.319 --> 00:11:09.519
Hermann plans to seek out Newton for answer,
as the man has all the records of the company's

00:11:09.519 --> 00:11:13.720
productions, while Jake decides to warn their
superiors about their new findings.

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:17.720
At the same time, many of Liwen's drone are
being brought towards the base, so they can

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:20.620
defend the facility against further attacks.

00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:25.149
However, the machines quickly begin to malfunction
as organic materials burst out from their

00:11:25.149 --> 00:11:29.399
heads, transforming them into Kaiju hybrids
that destroys everything in sight.

00:11:29.399 --> 00:11:33.679
The giant monsters make it onto the base and
causes tremendous damage, trying to destroy

00:11:33.679 --> 00:11:36.329
all the Yeagers while no pilots are inside.

00:11:36.329 --> 00:11:40.470
On the other side, Hermann has finally found
Newton and desperately tells the man about

00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:42.300
the killer drones from their company.

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:45.959
Hermann thinks that Liwen has planned this
from the very beginning, and wants Newton

00:11:45.959 --> 00:11:47.959
to help him shut down the robots.

00:11:47.959 --> 00:11:52.769
They make it into the control center and forces
all the scientists out, but Hermann soon realizes

00:11:52.769 --> 00:11:56.949
that something is wrong as Newton begins activating
even more drones.

00:11:56.949 --> 00:12:00.949
Numerous Kaiju hybrid arise from the oceans
everywhere and begins pouring their energies

00:12:00.949 --> 00:12:04.309
together, opening portals towards the alien's
universe.

00:12:04.309 --> 00:12:08.970
It turns out that Newton's mind has been infected
by the precursors after many unions with the

00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:12.809
Kaiju's brain, and he seeks to destroy humanity
just like 10 years ago.

00:12:12.809 --> 00:12:18.009
Luckily, Liwen rushes in just in time and
shoots at Newton, forcing the man to run away.

00:12:18.009 --> 00:12:22.489
The woman quickly tries to disable her drones,
eventually managing to bypass the firewalls

00:12:22.489 --> 00:12:24.189
and reboot the systems,

00:12:24.189 --> 00:12:27.839
destroying the kaiju brains inside the machines
and causing the robots to fall towards the

00:12:27.839 --> 00:12:28.839
ground.

00:12:28.839 --> 00:12:32.940
The drones in the ocean near the headquarters
are also disabled, causing the portal to close

00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:37.019
prematurely and cutting the Kaiju in half
as it tries to climb out.

00:12:37.019 --> 00:12:41.269
However, their efforts were not enough as
three kaiju have made it out from the other

00:12:41.269 --> 00:12:45.540
portals, including Hakuja and Strikehron along
side their big brother Raijin.

00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:49.520
They try to analyze the movement patterns
of the giant monsters and found out that they

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:51.600
are all moving towards Mount Fuji.

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:55.980
Hermann speculates that the aliens are trying
use the Kaiju's blood, which reacts violently

00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:58.119
with elements in the planet's core,

00:12:58.119 --> 00:13:02.879
allowing them to activate the ring of fire
around the pacific ocean, essentially terraforming

00:13:02.879 --> 00:13:04.980
Earth and destroying all life in the process.

00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:09.600
They quickly gather up all the human resources
they can and by working together with Liwen

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:13.550
and Shao Industries, repairing the Yeagers
and preparing them for battle.

00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:18.149
The cadets are put into the giant machines,
where rockets are welded to the yeager's backs.

00:13:18.149 --> 00:13:22.620
The giant robots are eventually able to achieve
take off, launching into the sky and heading

00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:24.069
towards the enemies.

00:13:24.069 --> 00:13:28.449
Meanwhile, the giant monsters have arrived
inside Tokyo, as they wreck havoc everywhere

00:13:28.449 --> 00:13:32.449
they go, knocking over the buildings and sending
the people flying in the air.

00:13:32.449 --> 00:13:36.250
The three monsters regroup together as they
head towards the mountain, but the yeagers

00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:40.350
quickly arrive to intercept the enemies, as
they jump off the rockets and land inside

00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:41.519
the cities.

00:13:41.519 --> 00:13:45.800
After receiving the orders from Hermann that
the people have all evacuated, the team charges

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:47.689
at the monsters all together.

00:13:47.689 --> 00:13:52.589
Saber Athena takes out her swords and slashes
across Hakuja, kicking the monster furiously

00:13:52.589 --> 00:13:54.989
and sending it crashing into the buildings.

00:13:54.989 --> 00:13:58.980
Gypsy avenger charges at Raijin and throws
a devastating punch at the monster,

00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:03.600
but the kaiju is able to absorb the energies
and counters using tremendous power, knocking

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:07.470
the yeager across the city, barely missing
its teammate in the process.

00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:11.850
Bracer Phoenix tries to attack the Kaiju using
its massive guns, but gets knock over through

00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:15.980
the buildings like a ragdoll, crashing into
Guardian Bravo as a result.

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:20.410
With no other choice, Gypsy avenger decides
to use its gravity gun and begins toppling

00:14:20.410 --> 00:14:22.079
the building towards Raijin,

00:14:22.079 --> 00:14:26.429
landing numerous hits at the giant monster,
but the Kaiju refuses to go down.

00:14:26.429 --> 00:14:31.089
Hakuja tries to ambush the yeager, but Athena
manages to kick the monster across the face

00:14:31.089 --> 00:14:33.609
and keep the enemy away from it's teammate.

00:14:33.609 --> 00:14:38.110
While everyone is busy fighting, Strikethron
tries to ambush Athena, knocking the robot's

00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:42.649
weapons away and charging furiously forwards,
pinning the yeager on a building.

00:14:42.649 --> 00:14:46.739
Bracer Pheonix sees this and fires numerous
rounds at the ambusher, pushing the Kaiju

00:14:46.739 --> 00:14:48.499
back away from the humans.

00:14:48.499 --> 00:14:52.459
Guardian Bravo rushes in to help as well,
unleashing it's massive whip and striking

00:14:52.459 --> 00:14:57.859
Hakuja continuously, knocking the monster
away from Athena as it crashes into the buildings.

00:14:57.859 --> 00:15:01.980
Hakuja appears to retreat underground away
from the fight, but the monster reemerges

00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:05.980
quickly behind Bracer Phoenix, trying to ambush
the yeager once again.

00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:10.429
Luckily, the cadets saw the monster coming,
and the robot begins shooting at the Kaiju

00:15:10.429 --> 00:15:14.169
using it's cannons, pushing Hakuja back as
it scream in pain.

00:15:14.169 --> 00:15:18.540
The yeagers eventually gain the upper hand
and continues to pummel the enemies as they

00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:19.829
begin to win the battle.

00:15:19.829 --> 00:15:23.389
However, what they don't realize is that Newton
is watching them from afar,

00:15:23.389 --> 00:15:27.609
planning to help the creatures by releasing
numerous drones from inside the buildings,

00:15:27.609 --> 00:15:29.600
heading directly towards the kaijus.

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:33.619
The machines begin to crawl onto the monsters
and changing their physiology, fusing the

00:15:33.619 --> 00:15:35.999
three kaijus into something a lot bigger,

00:15:35.999 --> 00:15:41.019
eventually creating a mega Kaiju that towers
over all the yeagers, as it roars furiously

00:15:41.019 --> 00:15:42.939
and sending all the cars in the air.

00:15:42.939 --> 00:15:46.600
The Yeagers all charge forwards with their
guns blazing, shooting all their weapons at

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:47.610
the same time,

00:15:47.610 --> 00:15:51.379
but the Mega Kaiju punches the ground and
creates a massive shockwave, knocking all

00:15:51.379 --> 00:15:52.790
the fighters away.

00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:57.169
Guardian Bravo manages to resist the attack
and charges furiously at the enemy, launching

00:15:57.169 --> 00:15:58.679
its weapon at the monster,

00:15:58.679 --> 00:16:03.119
but the Kaiju is able to stop the attack and
throws the yeager into the buildings, eventually

00:16:03.119 --> 00:16:07.359
tossing the machine using tremendous force,
destroying the robot completely.

00:16:07.359 --> 00:16:11.899
Saber Athena jumps in to attack as well, but
is quickly cut into pieces by the monster's

00:16:11.899 --> 00:16:13.959
tail, and the thrown into the backgrounds.

00:16:13.959 --> 00:16:18.160
Bracer Phoenix launches the giant mace towards
the kaiju, but the attack is not effective

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:21.939
as the monster grabs onto the yeager and begins
ripping everything apart.

00:16:21.939 --> 00:16:26.850
Luckily, the cadets are able to eject in time
by using the escape pods, and Amara is able

00:16:26.850 --> 00:16:29.059
to survive alongside her teammates.

00:16:29.059 --> 00:16:33.089
The mega kaiju continues towards the mountain,
but Gypsy jumps out from the buildings and

00:16:33.089 --> 00:16:36.299
slashes at the monster, knocking it towards
the ground.

00:16:36.299 --> 00:16:40.259
Gypsy tries to hold off the Kaiju by using
the plasma cannon, but the monster attacks

00:16:40.259 --> 00:16:42.179
the yeager's head using its tail,

00:16:42.179 --> 00:16:46.579
wounding Lambert in the process, while the
robot gets knocked away into the buildings.

00:16:46.579 --> 00:16:51.040
Newton mocks the human's failure at defeating
his creature, which captures the kaiju's attention,

00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:55.329
but surprisingly, the monster ignores the
man as it continues towards Mount Fuji.

00:16:55.329 --> 00:17:00.589
Without a second pilot, Jake has no way to
stop the enemy, but Amara shows up soon towards

00:17:00.589 --> 00:17:04.189
the yeager and decides to operate the machine
along side her friend.

00:17:04.189 --> 00:17:08.889
To their surprise, Liwen appears as well by
controlling Amara's yeager, Scrapper, and

00:17:08.889 --> 00:17:12.799
she brings one of the rockets for Gypsy so
they can finally stop the kaiju.

00:17:12.799 --> 00:17:17.179
The rocket begins to ignite and drags the
yeager across the city, eventually propelling

00:17:17.179 --> 00:17:20.740
the giant machine upwards while scrapper tries
desperately to hold on.

00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:24.809
They eventually makes it into the atmospheres
before the rocket loses all the fuels and

00:17:24.809 --> 00:17:27.579
the yeager begins to free fall towards the
ground.

00:17:27.579 --> 00:17:32.019
Gypsy throws the rocket away and begins charging
towards the mega Kaiju, planning to crash

00:17:32.019 --> 00:17:34.669
into the enemy as it begins to catch on fire.

00:17:34.669 --> 00:17:39.149
The main character grabs onto Amara and tries
to use the escape pots, but the system begins

00:17:39.149 --> 00:17:42.169
to malfunction, trapping them inside as result.

00:17:42.169 --> 00:17:46.779
Luckily, Scrapper is able to drill into the
yeager and offers them a way out, as it jumps

00:17:46.779 --> 00:17:48.940
away from Gypsy in the last moment.

00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:53.289
The mega kaiju finally makes it to the entrance
of the mountain's peak, but gypsy flies in

00:17:53.289 --> 00:17:58.210
and smashes into the monster, causing a giant
shockwave that knocks them into pieces.

00:17:58.210 --> 00:18:02.870
Surprisingly, the massive kaiju is able to
get up one last time, but ultimately dies

00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:05.679
as the monster's lower body is completely
destroyed.

00:18:05.679 --> 00:18:10.620
Jake is able to escape along side Amara thanks
to her yeager, Scrapper, and the two are able

00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:13.600
to celebrate after finally saving the world.

00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:18.140
Sometimes later, Newton is captured inside
a secret facility, while Jake walks in and

00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:20.919
decides to learn everything about the precursors,

00:18:20.919 --> 00:18:26.470
planning to attack the aliens in their own
universe and taking the fight to the enemies.

00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:28.350
