00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:05.840
Everyone in Japan has disappeared. And now, you're&nbsp;
trapped in a deserted city, and forced to compete&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:10.000
in terrifying games, where every mistake is&nbsp;
fatal. Everything in this world is designed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.240
to eliminate you. Well, we can outsmart it with&nbsp;
five simple rules to stay alive. And by the end,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.840
I will show you how to beat every single&nbsp;
death game that they have to face.&nbsp;

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.800
I'm going to break down the mistakes&nbsp;
made, which you should do in how to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.720
be the death games of Alice in Borderland.
We meet this guy, Arisu, who's living life&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.360
one game at a time. He looks like a loser, but&nbsp;
looks can be deceiving. He's an experienced gamer,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.360
which makes him a strategist. He reads&nbsp;
textbooks on math. He's familiar with mechanics,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.360
and this digital dexterity is impressive.
Now, this might look like a useless hobby,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.160
but these games train your brain to make fast and&nbsp;
practical decisions in high-pressure situations.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.480
Also, being told you're a disappointment every&nbsp;
day by your family is going to put a serious chip&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.560
on your shoulder. And sometimes you just need&nbsp;
the right scenario to unlock that part of you.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.840
He joins his friend, Karube, the&nbsp;
bartender, and Chota, an IT guy.&nbsp;

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.440
All of them have had some bad luck today and wish&nbsp;
they could hit the reset button on their crappy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.200
lives. Karube here imagines what they would do&nbsp;
in a zombie outbreak, and he's convinced that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.040
his friend, Arisu, has the most potential&nbsp;
to survive. This guy seems to understand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.880
everyone's strengths and weaknesses. And this&nbsp;
immediately makes him a leader when things go bad.&nbsp;

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.040
He does have a massive weakness, however, and&nbsp;
that's situational awareness. As they run out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.360
of the road, the IT guy hears a loud boom from&nbsp;
it looks like strange fireworks. The noise gets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.600
the attention of everyone else on the sidewalk,&nbsp;
including the station police. Thinking they're in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.760
trouble, they hide in a bathroom stall. The lights&nbsp;
go out mysteriously, and don't come back on.&nbsp;

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.240
And everything outside has gone quiet. What&nbsp;
just happened? The friends leave the stall to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.960
find the entire city is completely abandoned. And&nbsp;
what's even creepier is that their phones aren't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.480
even working. This is seriously unsettling. But&nbsp;
the important thing right now is to stay calm.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.240
There's a lot of information out there&nbsp;
because we have a whole city to ourselves.&nbsp;

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.680
We don't know what else has disappeared.&nbsp;
So, I would scout the city to look for food,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.480
fire, water, animals, and any signs of life. We&nbsp;
won't find all the answers, but at least we can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.720
confirm what we have to work with in this new&nbsp;
reality. That night, a nearby building lights&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.640
up with a message, welcoming players to a game&nbsp;
and guiding them to the GM building. The only&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.040
place in the neighborhood with any power.
Okay. We obviously shouldn't trust any of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.360
this. So, I'd first want some protection. Japan&nbsp;
has stricter gun laws, but you can buy rifles.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.040
And there's a shop right here called Shibuya&nbsp;
Firearms Inc. only five minutes away from them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.440
I'd also grab a battery powered flashlight and a&nbsp;
backpack before investigating what's out there.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.320
They arrive to the location, but nobody is there.
Now, I would scuddle the perimeter of the building&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.880
before entering. We have no idea what this is. And&nbsp;
we might find out more from our surroundings. They&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.400
enter the building, and then only pass-through&nbsp;
lasers trapping themselves inside where they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.560
find a table full of phones. They actually work,&nbsp;
and they all have facial recognition, but they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:42.160
don't have any signal. This is highly suspicious.
A computerized voice starts a two-minute countdown&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.720
waiting for other players to join. That's when&nbsp;
this foxy lady waltzes in and drops a truth bomb.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.840
They're now players in a game and running away&nbsp;
is not an option. This guy's ID tag got shot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.520
with a laser, and it came straight down from the&nbsp;
top of the building. But it's important to keep&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.680
calm because critical thinking and observation&nbsp;
will be more important to you than before.&nbsp;

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.760
If we were cautious, and been more suspicious&nbsp;
of our surroundings, we might have expected&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.360
that these lights were luring us here for&nbsp;
a reason. We won't survive this new world&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.680
without learning how to be observant of every&nbsp;
detail, no matter how small. Another girl runs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.240
in and passes the laser grid trapping herself&nbsp;
in with the rest of them. If this is a game,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.720
then these are either our teammates or opponents.
Now, everything must be thought about in terms of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.120
competition and survival. And whoever realizes&nbsp;
this first will have the advantage. I would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.040
immediately start looking for weaknesses in my&nbsp;
opponents. This woman is dressed to impress,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.560
but it means she's more about perception&nbsp;
than practicality. She also knows a lot,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.320
but doesn't seem helpful. So, she won't share&nbsp;
knowledge without a trade-off for her benefit.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:41.040
And all this means, we can't trust her at all.
They step out of the elevator into a square room&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.360
with two doors, live and die. And all they have&nbsp;
to do is pick the correct one within the time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.440
limit. It's got a difficulty rating of three of&nbsp;
clubs. And if they win, they'll be released from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.680
the building. The IT guy starts recording from&nbsp;
his phone. This is a great idea because they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.960
can keep track of information as it happens.
But they should have been doing this from the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:01.440
very beginning. The woman tells them to choose the&nbsp;
door on the right, but doesn't give any reasoning.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.400
Now, behavioral psychologist will look&nbsp;
for signs of lying from shifting weight&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.320
to defensive posturing and avoiding eye&nbsp;
contact. This woman is showing all three,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:11.680
so there's no way of walking through that door.
But we should first think about the bigger&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.760
picture here, which is geometry and space.&nbsp;
We need to figure the bounds of the arena and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:20.160
its rules before anything else. This is a fake&nbsp;
ceiling. I would get on my friend's shoulders,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.000
and see if I could remove the panels to get a&nbsp;
better view. There's an obvious possibility that a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.920
trap is waiting in the next room. So, I would even&nbsp;
consider unscrewing the light bulbs, and throw&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.920
them into the rooms to see they trigger anything.
Smoke begins pumping through the floor. They're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.600
going to suffocate if they don't do something.&nbsp;
The woman pressures the school girl to pick a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:40.400
door quickly. She panics and rushes through a&nbsp;
door, getting killed on the other side. This is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.720
a death game and the stakes are real. All three&nbsp;
men are horrified, but the woman doesn't blink,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.960
and picks the other door. They follow after&nbsp;
her as the room behind explodes into flames.&nbsp;

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.840
And this time, they have 10 seconds less, the&nbsp;
woman tries to manipulate the others to open&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.920
the next door, and Arisu here nearly falls&nbsp;
for it, but he's too scared. The bartender&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:02.800
Karube decides to take a wild guess, and they run&nbsp;
through. As the group escapes another close call,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.160
each room has given them less time than&nbsp;
before. And they've been lucky so far.&nbsp;

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.400
But unless they find a pattern here, they're&nbsp;
all going to die. Now, with deductive reasoning,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.320
we can extract quite a bit of information to&nbsp;
help us decide which doors to choose next.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:18.400
We know there are at least three rows of rooms for&nbsp;
the door patterns, from where they've been so far.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.920
And that one left most end of the building&nbsp;
because there are never doors on this wall.&nbsp;

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:25.520
Also, the rooms are square. So, the&nbsp;
three rows can make a grid of nine or 12,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.760
depending on the shape of the building itself. But&nbsp;
observation here is the key to beating this thing,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.640
because if we were paying close attention to&nbsp;
our surroundings, we would see it from the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:36.560
evacuation map that the building is square.&nbsp;
Therefore, it must be nine rooms total.&nbsp;

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:40.960
And by the process of elimination, it tells us&nbsp;
which rooms are safe, or where we've already been.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:45.120
Arisu here, figures this out another way. Since&nbsp;
he's a car fanatic, he remembers the model and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.800
length of the BMW downstairs, and uses it&nbsp;
to calculate the buildings that mentions.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:53.200
He then measures the room size of his feet to&nbsp;
extrapolate the complete layout of the game.&nbsp;

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:57.280
This is the moment that hooked me into the&nbsp;
series, strategies like this just blow my mind,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:01.520
and the theory works perfectly, as they make&nbsp;
another escape. Until they reach the last room,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:05.040
we need to realize that something is wrong.&nbsp;
They're in the back-left corner of the building.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:08.080
The dyed door doesn't lead anywhere at&nbsp;
all, but if they take the leave door,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:12.480
they'll be back in the trap room where the&nbsp;
school girl died. He's completely stuck. Okay.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:16.160
Every building is required to have a stairwell&nbsp;
for fire escapes, and we haven't seen one yet.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.680
Based on the evacuation plan, we can be&nbsp;
confident that the exit is to the right.&nbsp;

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:23.760
But if I wasn't sure, I'd encourage the woman to&nbsp;
open the door first. She's more likely to trust&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:27.600
me if we made it this far, but if I'm wrong, at&nbsp;
least it's on me or my friends that pay the price.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:31.600
The gamer remembers his friend was recording,&nbsp;
and asks to look. The friend's video recording&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:34.320
confirms that there's no door on the&nbsp;
other side of the room, and they barely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:38.080
make it out as the IT guy burns his leg.
They finally exit the building, and get a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:41.840
message that they've beaten the challenge. The&nbsp;
woman finds a playing card, the three of clubs,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:45.040
and their phones say they've each earned&nbsp;
a three-day visa, which begs the question.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:49.120
If they're not in Japan, where are they?&nbsp;
Suddenly, another player walks down the alley,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:54.080
say his visa expires today. The group watches as&nbsp;
a laser falls from the sky, killing him instantly.&nbsp;

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:57.760
That's when the power to the whole building&nbsp;
shuts off again. They've got to find another&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:02.320
game to play to extend their own visa, because&nbsp;
if they don't, it's game over. Okay. It looks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:05.600
like we could be here for a while. So, now&nbsp;
is the time to start thinking about shelter,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:10.560
food, weapons, and lifestyle changes. Canned food&nbsp;
is the obvious choice to start because it's quick,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:13.680
stores well, and there's a lot of it.
But it's not going to last forever.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:17.200
And we'll need to learn how to hunt, cook,&nbsp;
and guard it. Long-term, I would designate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:21.520
a nearby park to plant and harvest vegetables.&nbsp;
Squash, potatoes, and beans are filling high&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:26.080
nutrients and easy to grow a lot of. If there's&nbsp;
no electricity, it means no refrigerators. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:30.480
cabbage will be good because it can be fermented&nbsp;
into kimchi, and stored for a nutrient-rich meal.&nbsp;

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:34.320
That night at dinner, the woman tells them she's&nbsp;
been here for three whole days, when the guys&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:38.960
have only been here for one. So, when everyone&nbsp;
disappeared, it happened two days earlier for her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:44.000
How is this possible? Arisu realizes this means&nbsp;
time doesn't work the same way here. The IT guy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.320
thinks there might've been an EMP bomb because&nbsp;
after he saw the explosion, the lights went out.&nbsp;

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:51.920
But with all the missing people and the death&nbsp;
lasers from the sky, we should know there is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:56.720
no natural explanation for any of it. Somehow,&nbsp;
we've crossed a border outside the normal world,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:00.800
and we're playing by different set of rules.&nbsp;
Every game has a designer, and we have to find&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:06.000
out who that is. The only way to do that right&nbsp;
now is to play more games to look for clues.&nbsp;

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.080
On that note, we can't assume every game will be&nbsp;
exactly the same. Others might be different types&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:14.400
of challenges, and we need to be ready. Now, we&nbsp;
can actually tell a lot on the system they chose.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:18.160
This was the three of clubs, which is a low card.&nbsp;
So, it tells me there are a lot more games to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:22.160
play, and they're going to get a lot harder. I&nbsp;
would be training to improve my conditioning.&nbsp;

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:25.360
Work on improving memory functions, and&nbsp;
observational skills and common techniques,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:30.000
like I was in a MARSOC special forces bootcamp.&nbsp;
And for a gamer who sits in a chair 14 hours a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.920
day, this is a major adjustment that needs to&nbsp;
be worked on immediately. Later that night,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:37.120
the two friends make a plan. They'll join&nbsp;
a game, hoping to win. And by the time,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:41.120
they'll find a doctor for their friend's leg.
This IT guy is an asset, but if he doesn't heal,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:45.200
he could get them all killed in a game. This is&nbsp;
why friends shouldn't enter games with each other,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:48.240
because there might be serious injuries that&nbsp;
affect the group, or even games that only have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:52.160
one winner. If we split up, we can all be winners,&nbsp;
and learn from each other about the other games.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:55.360
Mining information faster is&nbsp;
how we all survive and thrive.&nbsp;

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:59.440
They joined a game where they get new phones,&nbsp;
and see a lot more competitors than last time.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:04.080
This one is going to be intense. This guy is even&nbsp;
using the electricity to charge his music player,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:07.120
which is smart to take advantage of the&nbsp;
electricity while we have it. But those&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:10.880
old cassette players are battery powered.&nbsp;
Something suspicious is going on there.&nbsp;

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:14.880
These guys look battle-tested, and have probably&nbsp;
been here for a really long time. I would try to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:18.560
learn everything I can for them to better adjust&nbsp;
to this place because people and knowledge are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:23.360
the most valuable resources here. They're also the&nbsp;
most dangerous. The game is a five of spades. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:26.960
number represents its difficulty. While, the&nbsp;
suit represents what kind of challenge it is.&nbsp;

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:31.120
In this case, it's a game where physical ability&nbsp;
has the advantage. A player tells him clubs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:35.440
represent team battles. Diamonds are challenges&nbsp;
of intellect, and hearts involve games of trust&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:39.280
and betrayal. This one is a game of tag.&nbsp;
Everyone must run away from the attacker,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:42.640
and they've got 20 minutes to find a&nbsp;
safe zone before the building explodes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:46.560
They all spread out looking for a strategy.
As the attacker reaches the top floor and begins&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:50.240
the hunt. Now, this guy wants to funnel players&nbsp;
downwards because there's a laser blocking the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:54.800
exit below. And a chase is always easier downhill.&nbsp;
That's exactly why I would position myself&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:58.640
at the top floor in the corner near this pole&nbsp;
because I can slide down, or climb up quickly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:02.080
and I can access it from every floor.
It also leads me to the roof, which keeps&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:06.720
me completely safe. These guys check the rooms&nbsp;
for a safe zone, but they're all locked. They&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:11.280
hear gunfire upstairs and peek around the corner,&nbsp;
nearly dodging stream of bullets. The guys run&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:16.080
and hide behind a wall as the killer continues&nbsp;
downstairs. It's risky, but this is the perfect&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:19.680
time to strike. We can't run forever, and the&nbsp;
majority of this building works in his favor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:23.280
because they're long narrow hallways.
But the stairwells give us the advantage&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:27.200
because he can't shoot around corners. I would&nbsp;
sneak up behind, and push him down the stairs,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:30.960
and into the wall. He'll probably put his arms&nbsp;
up to stop his fall, and it might free the gun,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:35.440
giving us a chance to grab it. The gunman goes on&nbsp;
a killing spree, taking a few more contestants out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:39.520
as the two friends move to a better vantage point.
The killer turns to their direction, but doesn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:44.320
see them. And the gamer realizes the mask&nbsp;
impairs his vision. Now, they know his weakness.&nbsp;

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:47.600
The gamer yells to the other players that if&nbsp;
they call out his location, they can find the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:52.000
same zone as a team and stop the bomb. This girl&nbsp;
is the first to try. As she yells out the killer's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.360
location, and climbs up to the next level.
This girl is scaling the building like a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:59.280
freaking Ninja. The bartender wants to&nbsp;
ambush the killer and this guy agrees.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:03.680
He's also a tactical genius because he's able&nbsp;
to figure the killers, height, weight, and level&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:07.680
of training just from watching him. But Arisu&nbsp;
here notices something else. Both this soldier&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:12.320
and his henchman have locker key wrist straps.
Even though this is a life and death situation,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:15.440
this little detail is important because&nbsp;
it might mean they have valuable things to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:19.680
lock up and hide. If either of them dies, I'm&nbsp;
coming back, and taking it off their wrists.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:23.920
The climber girl offers to help, check the first&nbsp;
and second floor for the killer and jumps down.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:26.640
The gamer goes looking for the safe&nbsp;
zone with the climber girl's help.&nbsp;

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:30.080
While, the soldier and the bartender plan to&nbsp;
ambush the killer. It's a good plan because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:33.760
the killer will be distracted away from the&nbsp;
main objective, and they can beat the game.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:36.720
This guy lures him out of the stairwell,&nbsp;
but the soldier doesn't come to help. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:42.000
the guy gets shot to death. He's devious. He was&nbsp;
waiting so the killer would empty his magazine.&nbsp;

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.600
Suddenly, the soldier sprays the killer with&nbsp;
a fire extinguisher, dodging a wild spray of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:50.000
bullets. And now, he's out of ammo. They take&nbsp;
turns fighting him, and this killer is tough.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.240
Even taking several stabs from the bartender,&nbsp;
like it's nothing. And he slices a bloody wound&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:58.400
into the man's side. Meanwhile, Arisu here&nbsp;
tries to figure out where the safe zone is,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:02.080
and spots a door the killer shot at.
It doesn't make sense that the gunman&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:06.800
would shoot from far away unless he's protecting&nbsp;
something. He's also not the only one who realizes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:11.600
this as another player shows up. It's the same&nbsp;
guy with the music player. Arisu here slowly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:16.000
opens the door and takes a look inside.&nbsp;
A quick note, if I'm opening this door,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.880
I'm doing it from the other side because&nbsp;
I don't know what's coming out of there.&nbsp;

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:22.560
It doesn't hurt to have some metal in front of&nbsp;
you until you can confirm there's no threat.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:26.320
Inside, they spot a door and investigate, but&nbsp;
there's another killer, and the two survivors&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:30.960
have to run. But the player slams a taser into&nbsp;
his side, and the killer collapses. Earlier,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:35.760
what we saw was him actually charging his taser,&nbsp;
which he made from scratch. This guy is really&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:40.560
clever, but it wasn't enough to keep him down.
He runs into a room, and realizes he's now trapped&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:44.640
in the safe zone, where he sees two buttons&nbsp;
to stop the bomb, but both must be pressed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:49.360
at the same time. He yells at the location of&nbsp;
the safe zone and that he needs a hand. Now,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:53.120
I would still give this a shot. I can't search&nbsp;
far enough, but I could take off my shoes and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:57.280
throw them hard at the buttons to beat the game.
The killer breaks in, and Arisu here tries to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:01.200
fight him off. Luckily, the climber chick&nbsp;
hops to the window, and stuns him with the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:05.440
stranger's disguised taser. With one second&nbsp;
left, they jumped for the buttons, making it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:10.800
just in time. The killer takes her mask off and&nbsp;
looks terrified as the collar suddenly explodes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:15.200
These killers were actually players, and they&nbsp;
were playing against us for their survival.&nbsp;

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:19.840
Downstairs, the bartender finds a walkie-talkie on&nbsp;
a dead player, and hears two phrases, the answer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:24.480
is in her hands, and returned to the Beach. And&nbsp;
he's not the only one looting. This guy finds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:28.640
a note on the killer with a strange design. It's&nbsp;
not clear what this means, but this is a lot more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:32.800
important than you might think. I would definitely&nbsp;
be checking every dead body for anything useful,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:36.400
or maybe even something I can learn from&nbsp;
them.Every piece of information is valuable,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:40.480
especially when answers are so hard to come by.
The friends return with a warm welcome. They're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:44.320
grateful to be alive. And the group discussed&nbsp;
what to do with the information the bartender&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:48.720
heard on the walkie-talkie. Okay. This thing&nbsp;
is really useful because we can now listen in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:52.880
on our opponents. We need to use everything&nbsp;
to gain a competitive advantage over others.&nbsp;

00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:56.960
They might talk about game strategies, or food,&nbsp;
and weapon storage locations. All this information&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:56.960 --> 00:14:01.360
could make the difference between life and death.&nbsp;
The next night, the group leave for Shibuya&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:05.360
to enter another game hosted at the Shinjuku&nbsp;
Botanical Garden. And this one is going to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:10.000
unlike any other. They walk in and see a table&nbsp;
of weapons and some high-tech headsets. Okay.&nbsp;

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.520
If there's only four people here, and they're&nbsp;
laying out weapons, I'm thinking this isn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:17.200
going to go well for any of us. But when&nbsp;
push comes to shove, and you have to kill,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:21.440
weapon selection is important here. It needs to&nbsp;
be light enough to wield and run with, but also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:25.920
very sturdy. It also doesn't say you can't choose&nbsp;
two. I would pick the hammer and the hand axe.&nbsp;

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:30.080
Both are single hand weapons, easy to swing, and&nbsp;
neither of them will break from heavy impact.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:33.840
When they put on the goggles, the headsets lock&nbsp;
around their necks and turn on, recognizing the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:37.600
players with an advanced eye-tracking feature.&nbsp;
The game they will be playing is simple,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:42.880
hide and seek. Difficulty, seven of hearts. And&nbsp;
we know hearts are about trust and betrayal.&nbsp;

00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:47.680
This is about to get real ugly. One person will&nbsp;
be the wolf, the rest lambs, and whoever finds the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:51.600
Wolf becomes the new one. However, to win this&nbsp;
game, you must beat the wolf by the end of 15&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:57.840
minutes. Whoever is the lamb afterwards will die.&nbsp;
Okay. This is terrifying and trust is so important&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:01.840
here. As soon as I see that this is a game of&nbsp;
hearts, I'm keeping a close eye on this woman.&nbsp;

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:05.440
We saw her throw someone under the bus in the&nbsp;
first game, and she'll do it again if we aren't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:09.280
paying attention. The first Wolf was Chota,&nbsp;
the IT guy, and tries to remove the collar,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:13.600
but he's warned he might explode if he does.&nbsp;
He turns and makes eye contact with Arisu here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:17.440
and suddenly, he becomes the wolf. Realizing&nbsp;
the pattern, this one gets everyone's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:22.080
attention, tricking Arisu to look at her.
She steals the wolf role and runs away. The wolf&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:26.080
is not the hunter, but the hunted. Because only&nbsp;
the wolf will be alive by the end of the game.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:30.080
The bartender chases her, but he's too far&nbsp;
behind. She ducks behind a bush to hide from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:34.640
the man trying to stay the wolf until time&nbsp;
runs out. This girl is all about survival,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:38.240
but she needs a better strategy to hide because&nbsp;
she's wearing heels, which make distinctive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:41.920
marks that they could use to track her down.
If I was the wolf, I might consider climbing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:45.680
a tree. Nobody can lock eyes with me even if&nbsp;
they climb up to get me. And I can kick them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:50.000
down when they try. The bartender finds her,&nbsp;
and doesn't hold back. But the woman slams a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000
rock to his wound, and they end up making&nbsp;
eye contact. Now, he is the wolf, except&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.760
his friend arrives, and locks gazes with him.
He gets cornered by the two of them who fail&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:01.280
to convince him to switch roles. This is&nbsp;
why they call it a hearts game because the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:05.440
game designers want you to choose between your&nbsp;
life or your friends. There might not be a way&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:09.680
for all of us to win, but we have to try. This&nbsp;
is a botanical garden and there's water here.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:13.040
So, maybe if we all look at the same&nbsp;
point in the water at our reflections,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:17.440
everyone's headset will register eye contact,&nbsp;
turning us all into wolves and we'll all survive.&nbsp;

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:21.040
The woman goes to attack him, but his injured&nbsp;
friend tackles her to the ground and tells him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:25.920
to run. Arisu here dashes off to hide and tries to&nbsp;
remove the headset. He's about the clip it, when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:30.720
he remembers seeing the collars explode in the&nbsp;
previous game and refuse to go out like a coward.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:34.880
Karube here is distraught and starts hunting&nbsp;
for his friend. Arisu here is very emotional,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:38.800
but he doesn't want them to go out fighting,&nbsp;
and tells them he will sacrifice himself.&nbsp;

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:42.960
The bartender hears this and has a change of&nbsp;
heart. Since the very beginning, he always knew&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:47.440
his friend Arisu had the most potential of them&nbsp;
all, and he must survive. The gamer tries to find&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:51.680
them, but they've all gone silent. He finally&nbsp;
finds his friend, but by then, it's too late.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:56.640
His collar explodes, leaving Arisu here, the&nbsp;
sole survivor, and lucky winner of this death.&nbsp;

00:16:56.640 --> 00:17:00.080
This is the worst possible outcome. But&nbsp;
keep in mind, these games won't stop.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:04.640
I'm taking all of these weapons back with me. This&nbsp;
is seriously tragic, but if I were Arisu here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:09.360
I would channel my grief and rage into the games.&nbsp;
From now on, I'm building a prebuilt strategy for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:13.600
each suit of cards, and training every day&nbsp;
so that this never happens again. Workouts,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:17.280
aerobic, endurance, solving riddles,&nbsp;
and building a new team I can trust.&nbsp;

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:22.160
This is what I'm focused on. That way, my friends&nbsp;
won't die in vain, and I get more time on my visa.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:26.640
The climber girl from the tag game finds the gamer&nbsp;
lying in the street and looking miserable. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:30.080
she takes him back to her shelter for&nbsp;
food and a pep talk. Even though she's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:33.440
been through her own hardships, she still&nbsp;
keeps going, and he should too. Whether&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:37.440
he's ready or not, his visa will expire today.
And they both must join another game to stay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:41.680
alive. That night, the two of them had to the next&nbsp;
game in this tunnel, where they find a bus in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:46.640
road. Inside, there are three other men on board,&nbsp;
and one of them has an injured leg. They find out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:51.840
this game is called distance with a difficulty&nbsp;
four of clubs, and clubs is a team game. Now,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:55.360
his injured leg is looking like it might&nbsp;
put them all at risk if he can't contribute.&nbsp;

00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:58.880
Their phones tell them to reach their goal in&nbsp;
two hours, and it shows a distance counter,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:02.320
which starts at zero. This is the&nbsp;
time to explore the parameters of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:05.840
the game. I would walk both backwards and&nbsp;
forwards to see how the steps are counted,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:10.080
to get a clear indication of which direction&nbsp;
the goal is. One of the other players realizes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:14.160
that this older bus doesn't need electricity&nbsp;
to start so they could drive to their goal.&nbsp;

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:17.920
Unfortunately, there's no gas. So, they'll have&nbsp;
to run. The injured man tells his friend to go on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:22.000
without him, reassuring them that he'll find his&nbsp;
own way to survive, and they leave. Personally, I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.720
hate running. So, I would have spent a little more&nbsp;
time investigating gas options closer to the bus,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:29.680
maybe even pushing it to the next car&nbsp;
so we don't waste time going back.&nbsp;

00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:33.600
We also don't know how far away the goal is.&nbsp;
So, this bus might be early option. If this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:37.440
is a clubs game, I'm inclined to strategize as a&nbsp;
group. So, I might have them all scout the tunnel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:42.400
to find gasoline or other working cars with keys&nbsp;
left inside. By the time they reach 5,000 meters,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:46.720
they're exhausted. Okay. This is already a&nbsp;
clear sign that you're doing something wrong.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:49.520
So far, you're physically drained,&nbsp;
and you're not working as a team.&nbsp;

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:52.400
And if this is a clubs game, that&nbsp;
you need to rethink your approach&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:57.360
because the strategy needs to match the card suit.&nbsp;
They push forward, making good time on their jog,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:01.520
but then they see something coming in the&nbsp;
distance, and realize it's a panther. They&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:06.080
split up dodging underneath cars and behind doors&nbsp;
as one of the guys gets a mauled to death. They&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:10.000
find a flare inside of a car and manage to&nbsp;
scare it off, but they have to keep going.&nbsp;

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.920
Managing to escape, the remaining survivors&nbsp;
see a truck with Royal Enfield on it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:17.680
a motorbike that uses a diesel fuel, and&nbsp;
can be started without electricity. They&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:21.200
don't have the key, but the gamer realizes&nbsp;
that if they can take this back to the bus,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:24.080
they can refuel it and take the&nbsp;
injured player straight to the goal.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:27.600
The girl and the player keep going, while&nbsp;
Arisu here runs back with the motorbike.&nbsp;

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:32.400
Diesel engines use compression ignition and&nbsp;
gas-powered cars use a spark plug to ignite&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:37.040
the fuel, but they can still use regular gas to&nbsp;
power diesel cars. So, using this motorcycle was a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:42.080
great idea, but it's also completely unnecessary.&nbsp;
The other two have made it to the end only to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:47.440
find the steel wall leaking out water, and it's&nbsp;
about to burst. They're duped. This is no joke.&nbsp;

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:51.600
Water like this can crush you quickly because one&nbsp;
liter weighs a full kilogram. I would've jumped in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:55.280
the car because a steel frame could protect&nbsp;
me. And I might be carried down the tunnel.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:59.440
The man trips, and gets caught in the incoming&nbsp;
flood, leaving the climber to her impending death.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:03.600
But then, she see the bus in the distance,&nbsp;
Arisu over there has managed to refuel it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:06.800
and leans out the catch her arm.
She grabs onto him in the nick of time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:11.680
as the waters tip the vehicle over, knocking them&nbsp;
out. They climb out of the bus. They see that it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:16.080
was the goal this whole time. Those numbers were&nbsp;
indicating how far away they were from it. Now,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:19.680
if we had looked for the gas tank door to begin&nbsp;
with, we would have seen the giant sign that says&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:23.360
goal. But even if we miss that, pushing the&nbsp;
bus to the next car for gas, which showed the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:28.080
distance meter remaining at zero, giving us clear&nbsp;
indication that we're fine exactly where we are.&nbsp;

00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:31.760
Outside, the gamer tells her about a place called&nbsp;
the Beach is unheard about on the walkie-talkie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:34.880
and proposes they look for it. They don't&nbsp;
exactly know what to expect, but they're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:38.640
bound to find some answers. But I got to say,&nbsp;
if I figured all this out about diesel cars,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:43.040
you can be sure I'm not going to be riding a&nbsp;
bike anymore. Leaving the greater Tokyo area,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:47.120
they're further from the convenience of the city.
They're low in supplies, and the gamer has three&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:50.560
days on his visa. They spend the night in&nbsp;
the park, and the girl teaches him how to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:54.240
hunt and track wild boar. There's a lot we&nbsp;
can learn from this girl. She's a survivor,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:58.640
and has more experience in nature, climbing,&nbsp;
hunting, camping, and cooking. We need to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:02.160
learn as much as we can because you never&nbsp;
know when you might lose another friend.&nbsp;

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:05.520
I would also be scouting all the&nbsp;
possible venues on my new surroundings,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:08.960
because the more familiar we are with them,&nbsp;
the more advantage we will have in the games,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:13.360
like places to hide, or technical positioning.&nbsp;
That night, he spies a group of participants&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:18.160
about the play of death game and realizes these&nbsp;
players are all wearing locker keys on the wrists,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:21.520
just like those guys in the tag game.
Something is going on, and they have to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:25.360
get to the bottom of it. This is clearly an&nbsp;
organized society of players, and I wouldn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:28.880
trust any of them. Life and death scenarios&nbsp;
bring out the worst in groups, because they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:33.040
collectively take advantage of others, finding&nbsp;
ways to blackmail and trap you in. They followed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:36.960
them to a hotel that surprisingly has running&nbsp;
power, unlike everywhere else in the city.&nbsp;

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:41.440
But as they're spying, someone sneaks up from&nbsp;
behind, and knocks them out. I would really try&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:45.280
to be a little more secretive about it. I would&nbsp;
have taken the locker bracelet from the killer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:49.360
in the tag game, and used it to try passing&nbsp;
as a member to find out more. They wake up to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:53.360
these people in swimsuits interrogating them.&nbsp;
The gamer admits they're here to find answers.&nbsp;

00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:56.880
And this guy, Hatter, claims he has them,&nbsp;
as he reveals this wall lined with giant&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:56.880 --> 00:22:00.320
playing cards. He explains that if they&nbsp;
clear the games and get all the cards,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:04.320
one lucky person can go back to the normal world.&nbsp;
This is where the Beach was created to form a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:09.600
giant team of players to collect cards, and they&nbsp;
have no choice, but to join up. I'm not buying it.&nbsp;

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:14.080
What if a single person needs to earn all&nbsp;
52 cards himself in order to escape. This&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:18.080
rule isn't advertised, and they simply don't know.&nbsp;
Groups like this aren't interested in governance,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:22.880
or equality, or representation. It's always about&nbsp;
power and survival. Don't get involved. This&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:27.040
is fool's gold. And the truth is the more people&nbsp;
around you, the more to stab you in the back.&nbsp;

00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:31.040
On the plus side, these guys have fuel,&nbsp;
electricity, water, and guns. So, if we're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:35.200
caught, we should take advantage. They have three&nbsp;
rules. Everyone must wear swimsuits. As that way,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:39.280
no weapons can be hidden. Any cards won in the&nbsp;
game will be taken. And if anyone breaks the rules&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:43.680
or betrays the mission, they'll be executed. They&nbsp;
want to test Arisu here to see what he's made of.&nbsp;

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:47.360
And this scientist woman is here to observe his&nbsp;
decision-making. The group entered this room,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:51.520
filled of water in a massive transformer above&nbsp;
them. The name of the game is light bulb.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:56.560
Difficulty, four of diamonds. The goal, find out&nbsp;
which of these three switches turns on this light,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:56.560 --> 00:23:00.640
but you can only flip one switch with the&nbsp;
door open. However, if someone is in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:04.400
room with the bulb, the door won't close.
They can only answer once in it. And if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:08.800
they get it wrong, or the water touches these&nbsp;
electrical wires, they die. The water begins&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:13.280
to rise an Arisu here isn't sure what to do. But&nbsp;
he thinks he can eliminate a wrong answer easily&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:16.800
by flipping the first switch with the door&nbsp;
open. The problem is if it doesn't turn on,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:21.360
the door will close, and they won't be able to&nbsp;
confirm which of the remaining switches works.&nbsp;

00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:26.000
The lady challenges him. Is it worth risking&nbsp;
all their lives on chance? The water's up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.600
to their waist, and they have the time to&nbsp;
argue. So, Arisu over here goes to flip A,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:33.520
but he thinks about what's been said. There's&nbsp;
one chance to keep the door open, to confirm that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:38.400
the light is on or not. And he has an idea,&nbsp;
to close the door first, and flip switch A,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:43.760
then flip switch B with the door open, no light.
He has the player touch the bulb, and it's hot,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:48.560
switch A is the. Arisu here solves the puzzle&nbsp;
in the nick of time, and he's proven his worth.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:53.200
There is one thing they didn't think of though.&nbsp;
This game gave them phones with waterproof cases,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:57.040
and we saw the first game that they can record&nbsp;
video. I would put the phone in the room,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:57.040 --> 00:24:00.960
and face it at the light, close the door,&nbsp;
and flip every switch, recording the sequence&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:05.360
on the phone to tell which one the light is.
All players return to the Beach, and the leader&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:08.880
wants to talk with the gamer. He's impressed by&nbsp;
his wit, and invites him to a meeting with the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:13.120
executives. In the meeting, the leader brings up&nbsp;
that he needs to renew his visa, and the soldier&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:16.880
shares a look with his men. These people are&nbsp;
dangerous, and it looks like there's a rivalry&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:20.400
that we do not want to get in the middle of.
And if I'm Arisu here, I don't want to be caught&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:24.240
in someone else's drama. Because if we get close&nbsp;
to someone else's enemy, then we put our lives at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:28.560
risk. The strategic move is to stay low, stay&nbsp;
humble, and wait for your chance to slip out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:32.960
unnoticed and forgotten. The next day, the girl&nbsp;
warns the gamer that the militants are keeping an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:36.480
eye on them. And they start thinking about escape.
He goes around to asking different people what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:40.400
they know about this world, and learns that there&nbsp;
might be lasers surrounding the entire country.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:43.280
He scouts out the compound and&nbsp;
here's gunshots. Around the corner,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:47.040
he sees some of the militants near a dumpster.&nbsp;
Waiting for them to leave, he peeks inside,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:52.000
and finds a pile of dead bodies. Then a stranger&nbsp;
shows up, the same person from the game of tag.&nbsp;

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:55.920
He explains that this is what happens when you&nbsp;
betray the Beach, and wants to do something about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:55.920 --> 00:25:00.080
it. He has a proposal for the gamer, steal all&nbsp;
the cards from the leader, and leave this place&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:05.120
for good. It's a dangerous plan, but he feels he&nbsp;
must do something. The gamer agrees and tells his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:08.560
friend the plan. Luckily, she knows where the&nbsp;
guns are stored, but they're heavily guarded.&nbsp;

00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:12.000
Later, he's called to an urgent meeting,&nbsp;
and finds out that the leader of the Beach&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:16.160
is dead. He died from a bullet wound, and&nbsp;
they all wondered, did he die from the games&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:20.560
or was he murdered? The militants threaten the&nbsp;
others to elect the soldier Aguni, and they have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:26.000
no choice. This is the time to steal the cards&nbsp;
and escape. Arisu here is upstairs looking for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:30.480
the safe and after finding it, it inputs the code&nbsp;
that this guy tells him, but it doesn't open.&nbsp;

00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:35.600
The militants catch him in the act. This was all a&nbsp;
part of this guy's plan. The gamer was being used&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:40.080
to find out where the actual safe is being kept in&nbsp;
the room. We should know that all people shouldn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:44.640
be trusted and everyone is dangerous. There's&nbsp;
also a better way to escape. In the Beach's regime&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:49.360
change, everyone will be distracted enough for two&nbsp;
involuntary members to escape.I would be looking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:53.760
for that opportunity more than worrying about&nbsp;
the legacy of a place I don't even want to be in.&nbsp;

00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:58.400
Arisu was gagged and bound in a room. He's going&nbsp;
to be here until then visa expires, and no one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:02.400
will be coming to rescue him. Meanwhile, the&nbsp;
stranger returns to open the real safe, find the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:06.720
box of all the playing cards collected. The girl&nbsp;
gets dragged into a room by the second in command,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:11.680
and this guy is ready to do some terrible things.
When luckily, the power in the entire resort goes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:15.280
off. Confused, they all look around&nbsp;
and find a game sign in the room.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:19.440
All the exits to the Beach have been closed&nbsp;
off with lasers. The entire hotel has become&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:24.880
the arena for a whole new game. Difficulty,&nbsp;
10 of hearts, the last remaining numeral card.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:29.440
Everyone rushed to the lobby to grab a phone. But&nbsp;
in the middle of the chaos, the girl sees a woman&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:33.280
has been stabbed and everyone goes quiet.
The game is called witch hunt, and they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:37.120
have two hours to discover who killed&nbsp;
the girl, and burned them to death.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:41.360
The members interrogate the dead girl's friend.&nbsp;
They find it suspicious that she wasn't with her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:45.120
since they're practically inseparable. She claims&nbsp;
she was in her room, but they don't believe her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:49.120
and get ready to burn her at the stake.
And she's saved when the executive members step&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:53.840
in. Okay. This is a classic who done it. And we&nbsp;
have some information to work with here. First&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:58.160
of all, this is a hardscape, the most dangerous&nbsp;
kind, because the game maker wants everyone to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:02.400
turn on each other. And that's exactly why we&nbsp;
can't do that. There might be an obvious choice,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:06.640
but it also might be a trick of the game.
Now, this girl was stabbed with an ordinary knife,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:10.000
and all the militants have firearms and&nbsp;
samurai swords. We also know where they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:13.520
dumped the dead. So, I don't think it's&nbsp;
them. The best answers are with a friend,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:17.600
because we can learn about any behavioral changes,&nbsp;
or if someone was stalking her, or even if she was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:20.880
being blackmailed to do something. They all&nbsp;
start accusing each other when the soldier&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:25.840
Aguni finally steps in and threatens to kill&nbsp;
everyone if the real witch doesn't step forward.&nbsp;

00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:30.720
His second in command fires gun and sends the&nbsp;
crowd scattering. Okay. The key to winning here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:34.720
is to understand the game maker's design. They&nbsp;
will play tricks on the mind, and have you so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:38.720
focused on your own survival that you don't see&nbsp;
the big picture. So, first, we have to consider&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:42.960
if there's a way where no one has to die at all.&nbsp;
Now, we already conveniently have a dead body.&nbsp;

00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:47.280
I would throw her into the fire first to eliminate&nbsp;
every possibility before extreme measures are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:51.920
taken. The girls run away to look for the gamer&nbsp;
who is still tied up. Meanwhile, the swordsman is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:56.320
pouring gasoline in the basement. They're going to&nbsp;
burn this place to the ground. And the dreadlock&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:56.320 --> 00:28:00.400
girl finds the forensic scientist snooping around.&nbsp;
She's looking for super glue to get prints off&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:03.680
the murder weapon, which is really smart.
But I would tell her to find out where the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:08.000
knife came from and find out who's been there&nbsp;
recently, instead. The second command gets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:12.320
into to a faceoff with the shady guy who points&nbsp;
out the power supply at the Beach has changed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:16.640
since this witch hunt started. Meaning, someone&nbsp;
working for the game has infiltrated the resort&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:20.960
to switch the power. And the only people who have&nbsp;
access to the power supply are the executives.&nbsp;

00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:25.440
The shady guy rushes the gunman and sets him&nbsp;
on fire with a DIY flame thrower. Meanwhile,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:29.760
Arisu here scrapes the tape off his mouth and&nbsp;
calls out for help. Luckily, his friend hears&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:34.400
him cry and tracks him down to this door. She&nbsp;
rescues him, and catches him up to speed. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:38.960
thinks the witch is also a player in their own&nbsp;
game having to kill the girl and stay undetected.&nbsp;

00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:43.040
That's when he realizes he's looking at this the&nbsp;
wrong way. He should be thinking like the game&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:46.960
designer. They knew the leader died, and used&nbsp;
the chaos to set this game up. The witch could&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:51.600
have moved the victim's body an hour before this&nbsp;
all started, and he thinks he knows who it is.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:54.720
There are 15 minutes remaining, and&nbsp;
the witch still hasn't been found.&nbsp;

00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:59.120
The remaining members are cornered in the lobby,&nbsp;
where the leader orders his men to kill everyone,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:02.640
but they're stopped when the gamer arrives. They&nbsp;
know he's not the witch because he's been tied&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:07.280
up the whole time. He begs the leader to work&nbsp;
together to find the murderer and gets attacked.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:12.480
Surprisingly, the soldier confesses that&nbsp;
he's the witch. And Arisu calls him a liar.&nbsp;

00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:17.120
But he knows the soldier did kill someone, and it&nbsp;
wasn't the girl. It was Hatter, the Beach's old&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:21.120
leader. The soldier's eyes tell him all he needs&nbsp;
to know. The night had Hatter went to renew his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:26.800
visa, the soldier shot him in self-defense. Arisu&nbsp;
here has figured out there's one way to beat this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:31.440
game without killing anyone. And that's that the&nbsp;
girl killed herself. This revelation makes the new&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:35.440
leader outraged as he starts fighting everyone.
But they're running out of time. It must put&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:39.040
an end to this before they all die. The&nbsp;
witch's friend knows a way to stop this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:43.680
and getting everyone's attention announces that&nbsp;
she's the dealer of this game. A laser pierces&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:48.880
through her head and kills her instantly, shocking&nbsp;
the Beach in this silence. Okay. What the hell is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:52.560
a dealer? There's clearly some things that&nbsp;
others know about this game that we don't,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:56.560
and she just got killed for telling us.
The forensic scientists appears and confirms&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:56.560 --> 00:30:00.800
that the murdered girl did in fact kill herself&nbsp;
because the fingerprints had a reverse grip on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:05.360
the knife. Then, someone starts shooting at&nbsp;
them. It's the second in command still alive.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:09.520
He fires into the crowd, but his rampage is&nbsp;
stopped by the soldier taking several bullets as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:13.280
he picks him up and carries them into the smoke.
With three minutes remaining, the group carries&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:16.720
the witch's body to the fire. And they all&nbsp;
clear the game, watching as the beach resort&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:20.800
burns up. But the shady guy comes back inside&nbsp;
to add the 10 of hearts to his collection. All&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:24.880
that's left are the face cards and it will be&nbsp;
a complete set. The next day, the gamer and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:29.600
the climber girl look for answers. On it, they&nbsp;
find a confession that they were both dealers,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:34.640
a group specially chosen to set up the games.
Sometimes acting as taggers or pretending to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:39.120
other players, they'll be killed if anyone finds&nbsp;
out who they actually are. There must be other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:43.360
people who are dealers pretending to be players.&nbsp;
This really sheds a new light on everything we've&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:47.600
seen. Maybe this chick was a dealer and wanted to&nbsp;
make sure everyone was killed in the hearts game.&nbsp;

00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:52.160
And this guy who willingly stayed on the bus and&nbsp;
insisted his friends leave was actually a dealer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:57.760
who set up the game for his own benefit. We need&nbsp;
to be more suspicious of others than ever before.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:57.760 --> 00:31:02.160
In one of the videos, the two girls go to the&nbsp;
subway, and revealed the dealer's secret base.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:05.120
It's a massive surveillance room where&nbsp;
others like them watch the games.&nbsp;

00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:09.680
And just like the players, these dealers have&nbsp;
to play games for their visas too. They trace&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:14.000
the girl's step navigating the metro tunnels, and&nbsp;
find the door to the secret base has been opened.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.720
Someone has gone here before them,&nbsp;
finding the dealers are dead,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:20.880
and their computers powered down. That's when&nbsp;
the shady guy in the dreadlock girl find them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:25.200
He realized the drawing on the note he found&nbsp;
was actually a route map of this subway station.&nbsp;

00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:28.880
And came here to find out what happens when they&nbsp;
get all the cards. But instead found these people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:32.640
dead and concludes that there's someone above&nbsp;
the dealers who is controlling the games. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:37.200
computer screen suddenly turned on for a special&nbsp;
urgent broadcast. And to everyone's surprise,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:41.840
it's presented by one of the Beaches executives.&nbsp;
She worked for the games this whole time.&nbsp;

00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:46.160
She congratulates all the players for the victory&nbsp;
and announces there's a prize courtesy of her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:50.240
team. Tomorrow at noon, there will be a new round&nbsp;
of games, but this time they're playing for the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:54.880
face cards. They now begin to see there's a grand&nbsp;
design to this whole thing. And this woman has the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:58.880
answers that they're looking for. As they make&nbsp;
their way outside, they look up and see a giant&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:02.800
blimp carrying a massive king of spades.
Citywide, more of these zeppelins fly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:06.240
in with face cards of their own. And&nbsp;
the next stage has officially begun.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:11.280
But what do you think? How would you beat the&nbsp;
death games in Alice in Borderland? Let me know&nbsp;&nbsp;
