00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.010
Hi, Mystery Recapped here.

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.310
Today I’m going to explain a fantasy film
called “The Man Without Gravity.”

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:07.759
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:08.828
Watch out and take care!

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:18.220
The movie starts as we see a woman named Natalia
and her mother, Alina, drive through a storm

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:19.520
to the hospital.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:20.720
The woman is in labor.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.990
In pain, she begs her mother to drive quickly.

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.960
When they reach the hospital, a nurse at the
reception informs them that no doctors are

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.269
available at the moment.

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:31.820
So, she herself helps the woman.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.130
Natalia finally gives birth but the baby doesn’t
cry.

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.300
In fact, he floats in the air like he is lighter
than it.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:43.620
The three are stunned; Natalia grabs the umbilical
cord, and gently pulls him towards her.

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.020
Natalia and her mother run away with the newly
born... without providing their information

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:49.180
to the nurse.

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.710
Natalia is over the moon to birth such a special
child; she assumes that her baby is an angel.

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.030
At home, Natalia assumes that if he eats something,
he will stop flying.

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.410
Alina asks her who the father is, but it turns
out that Natalia doesn’t know, because she

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:04.790
was a prostitute.

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.470
Alina then declares that the child will not
be allowed to leave his home; she wants to

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.409
protect the baby from the cruel world outside.

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:15.470
The following morning, Alina wakes up to the
child sleeping on the ceiling.

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.420
She carefully brings him down.

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.500
The two name him Oscar.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.810
Just then, four friends of Alina arrive at
their door to have a look at the newborn.

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.010
Natalia ties the baby to a crib with a belt,
and covers him with a blanket.

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:32.490
The women do not suspect anything; one of
them tries to pick Oscar up, but Alina doesn’t

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.900
let her, saying that the baby is fragile.

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.390
The women then leave.

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.009
The two then make the house’s ceiling comfortable
for the child, so he can sleep freely.

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.950
Alina tells people that Oscar is allergic
to the sun, so he cannot come outside.

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.170
Cut to a few years later, Oscar has grown
up into a beautiful child now.

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.610
He is still not allowed to go outside the
house by his grandmother.

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.694
His everyday life includes looking at people
through the window and watching Batman on TV.

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.540
Alina also teaches him to read and write at
home.

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.340
One day, Natalia makes him a jacket with weights
on its pockets.

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.829
This makes Oscar able to walk on the ground.

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:11.709
Natalia is happy, because now she can send
her son to school.

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:15.690
However, Alina is against him leaving the
house for his own safety.

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.220
Even when Natalia insists, Alina doesn’t
budge.

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.380
One day, Oscar is alone in his house, when
he opens the window and tries to get out of it.

00:02:23.906 --> 00:02:27.826
When Alina and Natalia come back, they are
shocked to see the window open.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.780
Initially, they thought Oscar had run away
from home, but apparently, Oscar’s jacket

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.560
had fallen off him and he was stuck in the
ceiling.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.129
Not taking any chance further, Alina starts
to shut the windows permanently, but Natalia

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:43.940
has had enough; she wants her kid to go outside
and look at the real world.

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.860
She fights with her mother, and takes Oscar
outside that night.

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.260
While on their walk, she tells him to keep
his power a secret; to keep himself safe from

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:52.590
the bad guys.

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.070
He limps while walking, as he hasn’t walked
that much in life.

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:00.100
That day onwards, Natalia starts to take him
out every day in his jacket.

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.300
They walk hand in hand; Natalia even teaches
him to walk better.

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:09.319
One day, Natalia and Oscar are shopping, when
she leaves Oscar outside a store.

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:14.120
While he waits, he bumps into a little girl
named Agata, and drops her groceries.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.450
The little girl is mad at him, and asks him
to help her carry the groceries to her house.

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:23.250
At first, Oscar hesitates, but then he agrees
to help her carry bottles.

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.280
The two walk away from the store.

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.920
They talk about several different things on
their way.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.099
After they walk for a while, Oscar is tired
because of the weights in his pockets, so

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:33.580
he throws them out.

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.370
The weight of the bottles keeps him on the
ground.

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:39.709
But when they reach Agata’s home, she asks
him for the bottles.

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:42.989
Knowing that he will fly away without them,
Oscar refuses.

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:45.840
The two tug the bottles and eventually drop
them.

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.470
Since the weights are gone, Oscar flies up,
but thankfully is stopped by a roof.

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.439
The little girl assumes that he is a superhero,
and watches him in awe.

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:58.881
She gives him her backpack so that he can
stay on the ground, and promises to not tell anyone.

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:03.310
Natalia is at home... worried to death about
her son.

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.320
Just then, he comes home running.

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.750
He tells his mother about his new friend.

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.269
When asked if she knows about Oscar’s powers,
he lies and says that she doesn’t.

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:15.630
From the following day, Agata and Oscar play
together.

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.329
She comes to Oscar’s every day for playdates.

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:21.239
One day, Agata’s grandmother brings her
over.

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:26.009
As Natalia and she talk, Natalia realizes
that Agata knows about Oscar’s abilities,

00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:28.870
so she doesn’t allow Oscar to play with
her from the next day.

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.470
Agata visits Oscar’s house every day, but
Natalia always makes up an excuse to send

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:35.040
her away.

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.090
One day, Agata brings her grandmother to Oscar’s.

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:42.720
Natalia dismisses them saying that Oscar has
to do homework, but Agata reveals that Oscar

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.250
doesn’t go to school.

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:48.554
The grandmother, along with other ladies in
the town, calls the police to Natalia’s house.

00:04:48.905 --> 00:04:53.465
They demand Natalia and Alina to admit Oscar
to a school; the two agree.

00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:58.780
It is now Oscar’s first day at school, Natalia
takes him in, but realizes that the kids are

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.850
supposed to keep their backpacks and overcoats
outside.

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:05.680
Saddened, she brings him back to the car,
and they come back home.

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:10.900
They finally decide to move to a remote town
to avoid anyone checking on Oscar's condition.

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:14.280
Cut to a few years later, Oscar is all grown
up now.

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:15.940
Alina had passed away.

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:20.070
The mother and the son have moved to the mountains
and live a normal life there.

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.340
Oscar always has his backpack with him.

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:26.180
One day, Oscar sees an advertisement on the
TV about a talent show.

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:30.199
The announcer urges everyone with a unique
talent to audition for the show.

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:34.169
He wants to take part in the show to showcase
his talent, so he decides to leave the town

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:35.789
without telling his mother.

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:41.200
A few days later, Oscar is at the talent show
where he shows everyone his flying abilities.

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:42.590
Everyone is amazed.

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:44.990
Some assume that Oscar is an angel.

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:49.960
Oscar attracts the attention of a talent scout
named David, who offers Oscar to be a celebrity.

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:53.650
David tells him that he will be called to
TV shows to showcase his talent.

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:57.699
Oscar’s biggest dream is to have a book
written about him, and David promises to make

00:05:57.699 --> 00:05:59.060
that happen.

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:02.500
Without hesitation, Oscar signs a contract
with David.

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:06.460
Then David gives him the title “a man without
gravity” as his stage name.

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:10.720
After signing the contract, David gives him
a luxurious house as a gift.

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:14.479
He wants his mother to stay in the house as
well, but David forbids it.

00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:19.770
The next day, Oscar starts performing on TV
shows and appearing as a model in magazines.

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:24.520
As he keeps flourishing, initially, he loves
the fun city life, but gradually he starts

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:26.240
feeling empty and bored.

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:28.350
He starts gaining a lot of fans.

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:33.080
To make Oscar even more famous, David deliberately
creates false stories about Oscar.

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:37.100
He even makes a museum about Oscar, where
he displays random items as his belongings

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:38.990
to profit off them.

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:42.920
Later Oscar protests about the media spreading
false information about him.

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:45.500
He doesn’t want to live his life like this
anymore.

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:49.840
He is bored of the celebrity’s life, so
he asks David to terminate the contract.

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:53.596
But just then, David mentions a publisher
wanting to meet David to write a book about him.

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:58.389
Hearing this, he changes his mind; his dream
of getting a book written about him is finally

00:06:58.389 --> 00:06:59.800
coming to life.

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:01.349
He is beyond delighted.

00:07:01.349 --> 00:07:05.300
However, when he goes to meet the author and
the publisher, he gets to know that they are

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:08.919
just interested in selling as many books as
possible for profit.

00:07:08.919 --> 00:07:13.080
They want to exaggerate his life story, painting
him as extremely poor in his childhood and

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:14.107
adding false stories.

00:07:14.686 --> 00:07:17.336
Hearing this, Oscar refuses to work with the publisher.

00:07:17.917 --> 00:07:22.453
The following day, David invites Oscar’s
mother over, because he knows Oscar misses her.

00:07:22.944 --> 00:07:25.474
She arrives to a party going on at Oscar’s
home.

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:29.910
Natalia has brought motivational quotes Oscar
used to collect back home.

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:34.300
Natalia is delighted to see her son, but Oscar
is visibly sad.

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:38.759
The next day, Oscar makes a mistake while
appearing on a live TV broadcast.

00:07:38.759 --> 00:07:40.419
David is furious at him.

00:07:40.419 --> 00:07:44.009
Oscar reveals that he doesn’t want to be
the man without gravity anymore.

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:47.699
He asks David to fake his death so he can
live a peaceful life.

00:07:47.699 --> 00:07:49.770
The news spreads like wildfire.

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:53.599
Everyone talks about Oscar's death, journalists
come to Oscar's house every day to try and

00:07:53.599 --> 00:07:55.220
interview his mother.

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:58.760
Days pass, and Oscar has changed his identity
to Desky.

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:02.611
He changes his appearance and pretends to
be handicapped, so he can tie himself to a

00:08:02.611 --> 00:08:04.792
wheelchair when going outside.

00:08:04.792 --> 00:08:09.193
Desky is now working as a receptionist, at
a hotel famous for prostitutes.

00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:12.979
One Christmas eve, every room is empty except
for one.

00:08:12.979 --> 00:08:15.289
Desky goes to check on the person in the room.

00:08:15.289 --> 00:08:19.110
He finds the new prostitute there, who tells
him everything is fine.

00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:23.759
As he is about to leave, the woman calls desky
by his real name, Oscar.

00:08:23.759 --> 00:08:25.180
Oscar is surprised.

00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:27.610
As it turns out that the woman is Agata.

00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:30.139
She has started working as a prostitute.

00:08:30.139 --> 00:08:32.539
They are very happy to finally meet again.

00:08:32.539 --> 00:08:36.800
The next day, they go on a date and talk about
many things from their past.

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:39.610
At night they come back to Oscar’s room
and have sex.

00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:43.920
They actually love each other, but Agatha
still hesitates to accept Oscar’s love because

00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:45.390
of her profession.

00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:49.230
They get into a huge fight about the situation
and Oscar leaves.

00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:53.839
The next day, Oscar goes back to his old town
to see that the place has been deserted.

00:08:53.839 --> 00:08:57.660
The museum they opened to display Oscar’s
belongings has been closed too.

00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:01.620
He goes inside his old house, and stays there
for a while when suddenly someone knocks on

00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:02.620
the door.

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:05.220
It is Agata dressed as her younger self.

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:07.880
Seeing her like that, Oscar smiles.

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:12.150
Cut to a few years later, Oscar and Agata
are married and live in Oscar’s childhood home.

00:09:12.658 --> 00:09:14.818
Agata is pregnant with their child.

00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:17.790
Oscar has started working as a window cleaner.

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:22.320
The movie ends as we see Oscar dresses up
as Batman... cleaning a skyscraper’s window.

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:25.380
He is living his childhood dream.
