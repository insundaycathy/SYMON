00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.700
Welcome to Cinema Summary, ladies and gentlemen.

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.200
Today’s a movie not often talked about by fans

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:14.400
Its the sequel to the classic weird, science fiction movie Donnie Darko

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.960
This is S. Darko.

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.140
This movie starts off 7 years later after
the death of Donnie Darko from the first film

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.460
who died after a jet engine crushed him to
death.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.520
His depressed sister, Samantha, has run away from home

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.680
Joining her best friend Corey on a road trip from Virginia to California

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:32.140
when their car breaks down!

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.280
They are saved by Randy who takes them to Conejo Springs

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.220
where they check into a motel and meet the
owner who tells them about Billy Moorcroft

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:40.460
a boy who went missing.

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.870
Strange things happen with Sam, that night.

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.080
She pulls a feather from a TV and teleports
to a windmill where a man sits.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.660
She tells him to save himself

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.600
and that the world will
end in 4 days.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.920
She takes him through a wormhole

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.820
giving him time to run away before the meteor
crushes him.

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.449
Sam wakes up on a bench with

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.659
no memory of how she got there, she is taken
by a cop to the meteor’s crash site since

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:03.640
it’s nearby the motel.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.890
There she learns more about Iraq Jack: a crazed
war veteran who has been going on about the

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.780
end of the world for several months.

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.509
She reunites with Corey and Randy and we find out that

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:17.100
Sam is a chronic sleepwalker and never remembers
where she goes during her walk.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.140
Corey and Sam have lunch at a cafe where they meet Jeremy

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.340
who tries to talk about the meteorite he bought.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.030
They leave and meet Pastor John who invites
them to the local nondenominational church

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.100
and gives Sam a flyer. But the girls aren't interesting and they leave

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.700
At a junkyard, Iraq Jack is frantically gathering

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.620
scrap where he meets Randy.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.819
Jack tells Randy about the so-called Princess, actually the

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:43.060
Sam in the White Dress, who with her unlimited
power saved Jack and could save Billy. Before

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.340
Jack leaves he tells Randy

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.040
"The world is going to end!".

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.160
At Randy’s party, Sam learns about

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.720
Randy’s missing brother who may been taken
by the guy who took Billy Moorcroft.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:54.689
In return,

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.689
Sam tells him her wish to be a dancer and
that she wants to ‘switch lives with someone else'

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:04.380
their conversation ends on a sour note when makes a comment about Corey’s promiscuous nature

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.300
That night, Sam in the White Dress commands
Jack to burn down the non-denominational church.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.150
And only 3 Days Remain until the End of the World.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:17.000
The next day, John and a cop talk in the ruins
of the church where Jack’s dogtags are found

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.800
revealing his name to be Justin. Sam runs
into Trudy, a god-fearing Christian who believes

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.890
she’s been chosen by God to keep the children
safe from the devil and sin whose distraught

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:26.940
over the burning of the church.

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.790
As Sam leaves she runs into Jeremy who begins to show signs

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.000
of radiation poisoning.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.900
We bare witness to a montage: Justin forging

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.590
a bunnymask, Corey and Randy in a car, Sam
walking through the town, and people looking

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:40.560
up at the sky.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.280
At an intersection, Sam and
Corey have a fight over wanting to leave Conejo,

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.960
and Sam walks off in disgust after Corey mentions that Sam once tried to commit suicide.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.040
But as Sam walks away, Corey sees a boy

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.580
Billy Moorcroft, gesturing to her. Corey gets out of the car

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.520
and as Randy drives away he is
T-Boned by another car

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.580
and accidentally kills Sam.

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.771
Back at the motel, a distraught Corey finds
a book about time travel and a story that

00:03:04.771 --> 00:03:07.580
Sam wrote when she was young, The Last Unicorn.

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.720
The story is about an invisible princess

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.820
and a boy named Justin who sees hers.
 That same night Billy wakes Corey up

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.020
and tells her the world will end.

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.300
After that night, 2 more days remain until the End of the World

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.400
In the next night, Billy takes her to a mineshaft

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.600
where she enters a portal to the past. We got back in time with Corey

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.240
to the spot where Sam and Corey
have their fight. This time, Corey is nicer

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.700
to Sam and this time Corey dies.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.780
Here we are again at the motel, where this time

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.320
Sam finds the story about the Princess and the book on time travel

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.840
Suddenly we cut to Justin wearing the bunny mask

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.830
who comes face to face with
Sam in the White Dress though

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:45.140
this time she has something sticking out of
her face.

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.700
He asks her why he showed him this vision of Sam.

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.460
The Sam in the White Dress
tells him that she died to keep Justin alive,

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:56.710
and asks him to die for her. Before she leaves,
she tells him to remember the future and go

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:57.540
to higher ground.

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.920
Did you catch that? The story about the invisible

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.160
Princess that can only be seen by a boy named Justin

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.800
About portals that go back in time.

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.080
That Iraq Jack’s real name is Justin

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.240
and that He was saved by The Princess.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:13.160
Taking all of this together, we know without
a doubt that Sam In The White Dress is his

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:18.120
Princess, and The Princess, as we just found out, is dead.

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.560
Things are going to make sense soon but just stick with me

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:24.740
Sam wakes up and after walking around town,
sees a white dress in a shop.

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.440
Jeremy’s parents' shop

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.000
Jeremy tries to comfort her and tells
her about the strange metal in the meteorite

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.500
when Sam sees his arm. She asks him "What's wrong with it?", although he brushes it off

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.160
as just a rash.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.740
She leaves though after Randy comes asking for forgiveness.

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.400
After which Jeremy headbutts Randy off his bike.

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.129
Sam heads to the church where Pastor John takes her

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:48.830
to a theatre where they stare into a blank
movie screen having visions of "God’s Plan".

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:52.830
And as Trudy enters, John puts the moves on Sam giving

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:54.760
Sam a bracelet.

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.419
Thankfully nothing happens
and Sam gives back his bracelet.

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:02.409
Elsewhere, Justin waits on high ground and
Sam reads the time travel book which reveals

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:07.800
that time travellers experience strange dreams.
Like this version of Sam who teleports to

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.760
places. With a foreboding declaration:

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.720
Here I come, time to die.

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.410
It is July 3rd and we

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:16.949
have 11 hours until the End of the World.

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:21.669
Sam awakens at Justin’s campsite where Justin
reveals that he is the grandson of the author

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:22.620
of the time travel book.

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:25.939
He asks her to teach him “how to do it” though Sam doesn’t

00:05:25.939 --> 00:05:26.980
know what that means.

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:29.820
So, Justin shows her the bunny mask, something that according to

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:34.240
Justin, Sam’s “dream-self” showed him,
based off a drawing that Donnie drew. He explains

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.900
that Sam showed him when she was dead.

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.510
She runs away to the mineshaft, where she finds

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:43.189
Trudy’s bracelet with it’s key. Sh enters the
mineshaft where she finds the corpses of Randy’s

00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:46.960
brother and Billy. Back in town, the townsfolk
believe Justin killed the kids.

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.440
Justin comes in to the diner, begging Sam to show him

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:51.340
“How to do it, before the world ends."

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:55.500
and he is arrested shortly after. She goes back to
the motel where Jeremy invites her to see

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.120
the fireworks and gives her the dress.

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.569
They go to watch the fireworks when tesseracts

00:06:00.569 --> 00:06:02.620
fall through a portal from the sky.

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:04.449
As the tesseracts fall, Jeremy’s becomes a bit

00:06:04.449 --> 00:06:08.949
psycho and pushes Sam onto the bunny mask
killing her instantly.

00:06:08.949 --> 00:06:12.780
Back in jail, Justin is approached by Sam
in the White Dress who frees him.

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:16.480
Randy finds Sam’s corpse and takes it while Justin puts
on the bunny mask.

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.360
He now knows how to do it

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:23.520
He goes back, before it all happens (He goes back in time)

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:26.060
and waits on the windmill where meteor falls.

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:30.380
Like Donnie Darko before him, Iraq Jack saves
the town and no one knows that he did

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:33.440
Sam decides to go home while Corey stays
with Randy.

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:34.900
As the movie ends, we see a montage

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:38.780
of people looking up into the sky, Billy is
still trapped in the mineshaft, Trudy and

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:41.960
John’s true crimes are never known, yet
the people are at peace.

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.894
So what just happened? Well like the first movie Donnie Darko,

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:48.500
S Darko revolves around the idea of the tangential universe:

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:51.200
another timeline of events, where
things happen differently;

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:54.300
Sam dying, Corey dying, Justin surviving.

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:56.120
The main timeline is the one where Justin

00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:00.600
dies and saves the town but the Sam in the
White Dress (The Princess from another timeline)

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:04.400
uses her powers to save him. But the 
universe doesn’t like that.

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:05.980
So it tries to fix itself.

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:10.060
So Justin was saved by Sam in the White Dress from another timeline,

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:13.720
in order to get Sam (NOT in a white dress), killed

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:16.800
So that Corey would go back in time to get herself killed

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:17.640
to save Sam

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:22.280
who in turn gets killed by Jeremy so that THAT Sam who just died

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:25.360
becomes The Sam in the White Dress, who frees Justin,

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:28.340
teaches him what he must do (to time travel) and gets him to go back in time

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:30.880
To get himself killed. *Narrator breathes*
