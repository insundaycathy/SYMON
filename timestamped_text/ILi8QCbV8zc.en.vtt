00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:07.853
hey what's up guys

00:00:08.045 --> 00:00:10.829
today I'll show you a thriller film: "The Woman" 

00:00:11.117 --> 00:00:14.045
spoiler ahead, watch out and take care

00:00:14.381 --> 00:00:17.885
an injured feral woman is treating her wound with mud by the river

00:00:18.125 --> 00:00:20.717
she was abandoned by her parents when she was little

00:00:20.861 --> 00:00:23.165
a female wolf found her and raised her

00:00:23.405 --> 00:00:26.909
she has grown up in the forest, far away from the civilized world

00:00:27.197 --> 00:00:30.941
she has dark skin, a keen sense of smell, and sharp teeth

00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:33.245
which enable her to survive in the wild

00:00:33.485 --> 00:00:38.525
one morning, the woman is bathing in a river and is not aware of danger approaching 

00:00:38.813 --> 00:00:42.029
a man is observing her through a gun with an evil smile

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:44.669
he is deeply attracted by her wild beauty 

00:00:44.909 --> 00:00:49.853
driven by his hormones, he follows her to a cave in the distance but he doesn't shoot her

00:00:49.997 --> 00:00:52.109
he has come up with an evil plan

00:00:52.493 --> 00:00:55.901
this man is called Chris, a lawyer who has a wife and three kids

00:00:56.045 --> 00:00:58.445
living in a big house outside the city

00:00:58.685 --> 00:01:02.800
when he comes back home, the first thing he asks his wife and children to do 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.829
is to clean the cellar before dinner

00:01:04.973 --> 00:01:07.421
they are surprised and don't know what happened

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:09.341
but they don't dare to ask Chris why

00:01:09.389 --> 00:01:12.653
as they are afraid of him and he is the head of the family

00:01:12.941 --> 00:01:17.405
Chris's wife feels a bit worried because she knows her husband is a psychopath

00:01:17.693 --> 00:01:20.669
in the early morning, Chris captures the woman with a net 

00:01:20.717 --> 00:01:22.445
as soon as she comes out of the cave

00:01:22.733 --> 00:01:24.461
he knocks her out and takes her home

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.157
restrains her with a wire rope and hangs her up in the cellar

00:01:28.493 --> 00:01:30.653
he touches and sniffs her smelly body 

00:01:30.845 --> 00:01:32.717
when he is checking her rotten teeth

00:01:32.813 --> 00:01:35.741
his finger is chewed off and eaten by the woman

00:01:35.885 --> 00:01:38.285
in anger, Chris slaps her in the face 

00:01:38.477 --> 00:01:42.509
the woman doesn't surrender, glaring at him with a stony-faced expression

00:01:42.797 --> 00:01:44.813
Chris decides to teach her a lesson

00:01:45.005 --> 00:01:49.650
to tame the woman, he tightens the rope and shoots her in the ear, warning her to be obedient

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.810
the woman starts to give in

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.050
later, Chris takes everyone to the cellar 

00:01:54.195 --> 00:01:57.939
and announces his plan of "civilizing" the woman in front of the family

00:01:58.083 --> 00:01:59.379
nobody objects to him

00:01:59.475 --> 00:02:01.395
his son is obsessed with the plan

00:02:01.443 --> 00:02:03.411
his eldest daughter is scared

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:05.619
while his wife is calm and emotionless

00:02:05.763 --> 00:02:07.395
she seems to be used to it

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:11.139
his youngest daughter is too young to understand what is going on

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:15.651
when they feed the woman, they use a rake to push the food towards her for safety

00:02:15.747 --> 00:02:18.195
the woman shows no interest in the food

00:02:18.435 --> 00:02:21.267
she knocks it over with her head and shows her teeth

00:02:21.507 --> 00:02:24.579
Chris orders the family not to tell others about the woman

00:02:25.011 --> 00:02:28.419
after dinner, the youngest daughter goes down to the gate of the cellar 

00:02:28.467 --> 00:02:32.067
and plays music with her recorder, trying to befriend the woman

00:02:32.307 --> 00:02:36.147
it's the woman's first time to hear music, which comforts her a lot

00:02:36.243 --> 00:02:40.227
in this family, Chris is the authority and the source of his daughter's fear

00:02:40.563 --> 00:02:44.019
before going to bed, Chris's wife raises doubt about the plan

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:46.371
she is not sure if they should do this

00:02:46.611 --> 00:02:50.067
Chris slaps her in the face before she can finish her sentence

00:02:50.403 --> 00:02:52.371
she doesn't dare to say anything more

00:02:52.755 --> 00:02:55.299
in the cellar, the woman tries to get rid of the rope

00:02:55.395 --> 00:02:57.507
but she is too hungry and weak

00:02:57.699 --> 00:03:00.243
she starts to eat the moldy food on the floor

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:04.707
Chris asks his wife to boil some water and bring it to the cellar with his son

00:03:05.043 --> 00:03:07.923
he thinks the woman is too dirty and wants to wash her

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:10.131
he wipes her face with a wet towel

00:03:10.563 --> 00:03:12.531
the woman is not used to warm water

00:03:12.627 --> 00:03:14.979
but she doesn't have any strength to resist, just looking at the wife

00:03:15.123 --> 00:03:21.555
watching her husband wiping the woman's body intimately, the wife is jealous and disturbed

00:03:21.843 --> 00:03:24.819
Chris senses his wife is unhappy, so he shouts at her

00:03:24.915 --> 00:03:29.331
telling her to stop looking at them with that look, and that is what he has to do

00:03:29.571 --> 00:03:33.939
the wife bends over and picks up a piece of wood, walking slowly towards them

00:03:34.227 --> 00:03:35.331
the woman sees hope 

00:03:35.475 --> 00:03:38.355
she thinks the wife understands her and is going to save her

00:03:38.643 --> 00:03:42.291
much to her disappointment, she just tells Chris to tighten a loosened screw

00:03:42.339 --> 00:03:43.923
in case the woman escapes

00:03:44.163 --> 00:03:45.651
Chris praises his wife

00:03:45.891 --> 00:03:48.147
the woman holds a grudge against his wife

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:50.931
since the woman is too dirty to be wiped clean

00:03:51.027 --> 00:03:54.723
Chris decides to clean her with a high-pressure power washer in the garden

00:03:54.963 --> 00:03:56.787
the woman is tied and can't move

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:59.283
the powerful stream causes her lots of pain

00:03:59.571 --> 00:04:02.067
the eldest daughter can't bear to watch her suffering 

00:04:02.211 --> 00:04:04.563
so she begs Chris to turn off the washer

00:04:04.707 --> 00:04:07.059
but Chris ignores her and continues

00:04:07.347 --> 00:04:09.123
so the girl rushes to turns it off

00:04:09.267 --> 00:04:11.955
Chris didn't expect his daughter to disobey him

00:04:12.051 --> 00:04:14.643
he shouts at her and asks her to turn it back on

00:04:14.835 --> 00:04:18.723
the woman begs Chris, imitating his daughter and saying "please" vaguely

00:04:18.963 --> 00:04:22.947
Chris is happy to see that, thinking that the civilizing plan is working

00:04:23.187 --> 00:04:24.915
he takes the woman back to the cellar

00:04:25.011 --> 00:04:28.179
then asks his wife to fetch a first aid kit and some food

00:04:28.467 --> 00:04:31.539
the wife treats the woman's wound and dresses her up

00:04:31.779 --> 00:04:36.339
admiring the woman, Chris jokes to his wife that the woman looks like his concubine

00:04:36.579 --> 00:04:39.459
the wife is embarrassed and doesn't know how to answer

00:04:39.747 --> 00:04:45.171
later on, Chris feeds the woman food and water himself and teaches her to say "thank you"

00:04:45.267 --> 00:04:48.099
the woman begins to seemingly adapt to this life

00:04:48.579 --> 00:04:52.035
at night, Chris goes to the cellar while his wife is sleeping

00:04:52.179 --> 00:04:55.107
in fact, his wife just pretends to be asleep

00:04:55.347 --> 00:04:57.747
she knows what her psychopath husband is up to

00:04:58.179 --> 00:05:03.363
shortly after, Chris can't hold his boiling hormones any longer and rapes the woman

00:05:03.459 --> 00:05:05.571
while his son observes in secret

00:05:05.715 --> 00:05:09.699
the woman notices the peeping son, staring at him with a sharp look

00:05:10.035 --> 00:05:12.771
the next day, the boy comes to the cellar alone

00:05:12.819 --> 00:05:14.691
the woman stares at him fiercely

00:05:14.739 --> 00:05:16.659
while he gives her a biscuit

00:05:16.803 --> 00:05:18.963
seeing that she has no intention to eat it

00:05:19.059 --> 00:05:22.611
he throws it away and tortures her with a pair of pliers

00:05:22.851 --> 00:05:26.547
the eldest daughter hears the woman's scream and rushes to the cellar

00:05:26.883 --> 00:05:30.147
she scolds him for his cruelty and asks him to get out

00:05:30.435 --> 00:05:34.611
seeing the woman is covered in blood, she apologizes to her for her family

00:05:34.851 --> 00:05:37.539
the woman doesn't understand what she is saying

00:05:37.683 --> 00:05:40.515
the eldest daughter tells her mother what her brother had done

00:05:40.707 --> 00:05:42.291
the mother gets very angry

00:05:42.435 --> 00:05:46.275
she doesn't tell him off right away but waits for Chris to come home

00:05:46.755 --> 00:05:51.747
as soon as Chris gets home, she tells him what his son did, hoping he can discipline him 

00:05:52.035 --> 00:05:54.531
however, Chris is not impressed at all

00:05:54.675 --> 00:05:57.459
he just asks his son if what she said is true

00:05:57.699 --> 00:05:59.955
his wife can't believe he is so twisted

00:06:00.051 --> 00:06:04.323
he asks his son again and gets a confirmed answer from the son's look

00:06:04.515 --> 00:06:06.243
then he says no one is hurt

00:06:06.387 --> 00:06:08.883
his wife is absolutely shattered to hear it

00:06:09.027 --> 00:06:13.107
Chris explains that the boy is just a teenager, and it's normal to do so

00:06:13.395 --> 00:06:15.267
also, the woman is clean now

00:06:15.363 --> 00:06:17.091
there won't be any problem

00:06:17.283 --> 00:06:19.299
the wife can't stand it anymore

00:06:19.491 --> 00:06:23.763
she can't understand how he can be so evil and be so cruel to a human being

00:06:23.955 --> 00:06:25.731
Chris thinks it is not a big deal

00:06:25.923 --> 00:06:28.899
she says what he did to the dog is enough to put him in prison

00:06:29.187 --> 00:06:31.107
Chris is annoyed and blames it on her

00:06:31.251 --> 00:06:36.003
she announces that she is going to take her daughters and leave him and the son alone

00:06:36.195 --> 00:06:38.019
her words totally enrage him

00:06:38.211 --> 00:06:40.371
he punches her and knocks her out

00:06:40.563 --> 00:06:43.779
though scared, the eldest daughter goes to check on her mother

00:06:44.019 --> 00:06:47.475
Chris asks the girl to give her a towel, and she will be fine

00:06:47.667 --> 00:06:49.539
just then, the doorbell rings

00:06:49.731 --> 00:06:52.611
Chris orders his son to help his mother sit on the chair

00:06:52.707 --> 00:06:56.259
it is the eldest daughter's teacher, who believes the girl is pregnant 

00:06:56.403 --> 00:07:00.387
because she often asks for sick leave and goes to the toilet during class

00:07:00.627 --> 00:07:05.100
the eldest daughter also throws up often, and even her dressing style has changed

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:09.650
today the girl didn't go to school, so the teacher decided to do a home visit

00:07:09.747 --> 00:07:12.915
the girl rejects her teacher at the door and asks her to leave

00:07:13.059 --> 00:07:14.403
but it is too late

00:07:14.499 --> 00:07:16.899
Chris hears her and invites her into the house

00:07:17.139 --> 00:07:18.963
the teacher would like to talk to the mother

00:07:19.011 --> 00:07:21.699
but Chris insists she talks with him in front of everyone 

00:07:21.747 --> 00:07:24.003
because there is no secret in the family

00:07:24.195 --> 00:07:27.363
the teacher then tells him that she thinks his eldest daughter is pregnant

00:07:27.507 --> 00:07:29.379
the girl denies it immediately

00:07:29.619 --> 00:07:32.595
she can't imagine what her father would do to her if he knows

00:07:32.835 --> 00:07:36.003
Chris stands up and assures the teacher the girl can't be pregnant

00:07:36.099 --> 00:07:37.539
because she has no boyfriend

00:07:37.731 --> 00:07:39.507
if she is, he would know

00:07:39.699 --> 00:07:43.059
he says there are only two men in this house, he and his son

00:07:43.155 --> 00:07:45.267
he thinks the teacher is humiliating him 

00:07:45.507 --> 00:07:47.523
the teacher is astonished to hear this

00:07:47.715 --> 00:07:50.787
she now understands why the girl didn't want to let her in

00:07:51.123 --> 00:07:52.563
she wants to leave in a hurry

00:07:52.755 --> 00:07:55.635
but she is knocked out before she can open the door

00:07:56.115 --> 00:07:58.803
Chris ties the teacher and drags her through the garden

00:07:59.043 --> 00:08:02.355
his eldest daughter keeps begging Chris to let her teacher go

00:08:02.691 --> 00:08:05.235
Chris doesn't listen and verbally assaults her

00:08:05.427 --> 00:08:09.555
in his eyes, all women are nothing and are worth less than a dog

00:08:09.843 --> 00:08:14.259
Chris drags the teacher to a barn where he keeps two vicious dogs

00:08:14.499 --> 00:08:16.707
he locks the teacher with the dogs in a cage

00:08:16.899 --> 00:08:21.363
Chris and the boy watch her struggling with fear and being attacking by the dogs

00:08:21.603 --> 00:08:26.115
suddenly, a blind woman that behaves like a dog appears and kills the teacher

00:08:26.403 --> 00:08:30.291
the eldest daughter takes the chance and releases the woman imprisoned in the cellar

00:08:30.627 --> 00:08:32.931
the woman kills the wife that just woke up

00:08:33.171 --> 00:08:36.435
then she goes to the barn where she kills the boy with a board 

00:08:36.531 --> 00:08:38.883
and rips Chris's heart out and eats it

00:08:39.123 --> 00:08:43.155
the eldest daughter is terrified and wants to escape with her little sister

00:08:43.299 --> 00:08:45.219
while she is looking for the car key

00:08:45.363 --> 00:08:48.723
the little sister walks towards the woman and hands her a bottle of water

00:08:49.299 --> 00:08:51.507
the woman accepts it and drinks the water

00:08:51.795 --> 00:08:53.331
she doesn't attack the girls

00:08:53.667 --> 00:08:57.795
she takes the little sister's hand and invites the eldest daughter to come with her

00:08:58.131 --> 00:09:00.387
the eldest daughter is reluctant at first

00:09:00.627 --> 00:09:06.147
thinking there is nothing left in this family but only traumas, she follows the woman 

00:09:06.147 --> 00:09:09.925
in the end, they all leave together and walk into the woods

00:09:10.419 --> 00:09:13.827
this's Daniel CC movie channel, peace out
