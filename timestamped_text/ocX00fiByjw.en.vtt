00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.610
Welcome to the breakdown where we breakdown
the most disturbed movies!

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:14.099
Today we are venturing into a film called
The Girl Next Door made in 2007 that is based

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:21.070
on a book which itself is loosely based on
the real-life horrific crime of Sylvia Likens.

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:26.590
Sylvia Likens was a young American girl who
was brutally beaten, raped and mutilated by

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:27.980
a woman and her kids.

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:33.330
You can look up all the details safely on
a Wikipedia search, but this movie is basically

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:38.210
a loose recount of what happened, but everybody
either has different names or are new entirely

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:39.210
for this particular story.

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:45.350
I'll say after watching the movie, the crime
itself of Sylvia Likens wasn't entirely simulated

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.730
in this movie, because if it was, it would
easily be the most disturbing movie we talked

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:51.730
about so far.

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.490
With that said, its time to document what
happens in The Girl Next Door movie.

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:00.420
Ria Silva, Peach Cola, Game Silver Dog, Liani
Springs!

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:10.030
You asked for it, here it is...lets get to
the breakdown!

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.969
The movie starts off with a successful business
man named David walking down Wall Street when

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:16.850
he gets a call on his trap phone.

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.890
He passes by a homeless old man who then immediately
gets hit by a car.

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:27.999
The driver of the car said fuck jail, so in
order to help, David gives him CPR which surprisingly

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:29.439
saves the mans life.

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:33.869
He reveals that if he could switch places
with that man he would, thinking the vehicular

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.729
pain would numb his own inner pain.

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:42.409
He talks about the 1950s, setting up a flashback
to an event that involved him doing something

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:48.030
bad, particularly to two girls named Meg Loughlin
and her sister Susan.

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.110
We then cut to him when he young catching
some crayfish or crawfish whatever you call

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.110
them.

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.880
Meanwhile A girl is solid snaking her way
behind him and her name is Meg.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.049
She pulls up the sleeves to catch some big
ones with her new friend and David notices

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:03.499
a scar on her arm.

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:05.789
She says its from a big accident.

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:10.280
This accident she's talking about killed both
her parents and made her sister Susan part

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.350
disabled.

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:16.820
Well Meg has to get back but if it wasn't
obvious already, David is feeling her a lot.

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.170
Back at home, David goes to his friends house
named Donny who is the cousin of Meg.

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.730
Meg and her sister are staying with Donny
and his brothers and their aunt Ruth.

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:31.010
David, Donny and the neighborhood kids all
group up to then play some special game.

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.820
In the woods, the oldest of the kids ties
this neighborhood girl up so she cant see

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:40.490
and they play a seemingly cool game where
she collects apples and throws them at people

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:41.490
hiding.

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:47.400
Well then idk she gets captured I guess and
they ask her extremely vulgar questions involving

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.460
sexual experiences, like if she ever played
with snakes this big before.

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:57.110
Well later, we see the carnival is in town
and Meg made sure to go for a night of fun.

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:01.100
David asks if she wants to ride in the Ferris
wheel which she accepts.

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:05.470
On the ride they talk about the accident that
took her parents and hurt her sister, but

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.060
gladly its not stopping her from keeping her
smile.

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:14.030
Once the ride is over, she wants a repeat,
but her Aunt Ruth wants her back home.

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:19.090
The next day comes quick, because here is
Ruth, who lets her sons and their friends

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:20.950
smoke and drink beer.

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:26.261
In this first encounter, she talks to her
sons Donny, Willie and Ralphie and their friend

00:03:26.261 --> 00:03:30.700
David about her old memories of the hoochie
coo at her carnival, which are just dancing

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:31.700
women.

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.931
She gets ready to take them to the carnival
for its last night and calls out to Meg who

00:03:35.931 --> 00:03:38.520
runs up looking a bit scared and bug eyed.

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:44.160
She tells Meg to stay here to look after her
sister and to also stay out of the ice box,

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:49.250
so she won't get fat, especially if she wants
to be a hoochie coo dancer.

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.380
This rude comment has David worrying about
her.

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.920
Then we see the boys in a tent outside looking
at Playboy magazines.

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:01.450
They also say a mean comment about Meg, which
helps support the fact that David is probably

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.050
the only one who truly cares about her.

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:07.710
They then go peeking into windows to see some
girls undressing.

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:11.000
I'm thinking this is Meg, but she shuts the
lights off.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.210
They then wonder if maybe she could play "The
Game".

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:18.650
Well the next day, Ruth assembles the boys
to help tear down some silk that's all up

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.099
in the trees, with Meg in the back looking
kinda sad.

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:37.030
She burns down one of those cringey silk nests
but Meg says she doesn't want to help tear

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:49.110
them nasty things down, and Ruth says in response.

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:55.009
(Ruth: Ridiculing Meg for Being Disobedient).

00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:57.710
Ruth says that her boys will handle it instead.

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:03.629
Then we see David looking clean and getting
himself a burger, but Meg stops him asking

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:05.349
if he could lend her money.

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:06.349
Why?

00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:08.469
Because she hasn't eaten in two days.

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:14.690
Okay pause, why do I get teary eyed from this
but can just watch a movie like Cannibal Holocaust

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:15.889
effortlessly.

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:18.830
Well David buys another burger and lets her
eat his.

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:22.639
She says she can't eat because Ruth wont let
her get fat.

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:28.099
She says Ruth hates her and that she is being
singled out all the time for the most minor

00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:29.099
things.

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:33.999
It strongly bothers her how much Ruth treats
her, and wont let her do anything including

00:05:33.999 --> 00:05:35.219
paint.

00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:40.661
Through David's encouraging words, she gains
the strength to endure further and to paint

00:05:40.661 --> 00:05:41.870
some pictures.

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:47.279
Later when David is working on a lawn mower,
he hears Ruth telling Susan to toughen up.

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:52.509
Even though she is damn ear disabled, she
calls her a stupid little shit for dropping

00:05:52.509 --> 00:05:53.509
laundry.

00:05:53.509 --> 00:05:58.409
Meg then drops by David's house to deliver
a water color paining and runs away just as

00:05:58.409 --> 00:05:59.409
quick.

00:05:59.409 --> 00:06:03.719
Then David goes over to Ruth's house, meeting
the angelic Susan.

00:06:03.719 --> 00:06:08.159
His intentions are to give the water color
painting to Ruth and say it's a present from

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:11.349
Meg, who stands there looking scared.

00:06:11.349 --> 00:06:15.590
Ruth looks at it, but says she doesn't want
it because it was meant for him.

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:20.779
She then sneak disses Meg by calling her a
whore behind the scenes and calling David's

00:06:20.779 --> 00:06:22.849
father a womanizer.

00:06:22.849 --> 00:06:26.860
Ruth is a woman who doesn't like woman, telling
Meg she's gonna end up to be a (Ruth: Slut.

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:29.469
Do You Know What a Slut is Meg?

00:06:29.469 --> 00:06:32.740
Do You Susan?

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:34.590
Of Course Not You're Too Young.

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:37.669
Anybody Who is A Slut..Deserves A Trashing).

00:06:37.669 --> 00:06:42.060
The ambiance of this movie definitely changed
during this scene.

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:46.750
At night, David wakes up hearing a heating
argument between Ruth and Meg.

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:51.009
They are arguing about possibly her admiration
for David.

00:06:51.009 --> 00:06:55.969
The next day, David comes over to their house,
seeing Willie, Donny and Ralphie tickle the

00:06:55.969 --> 00:06:56.969
mess out of Meg.

00:06:56.969 --> 00:07:00.569
When Ralphie touches her titty she punches
him.

00:07:00.569 --> 00:07:06.289
The other boys then call her the B word multiple
itmes and Ralphie goes to tell Ruth.

00:07:06.289 --> 00:07:10.550
They then pull Susan who was hiding in the
closet for some reason.

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:17.569
Ruth comes in, all on the boys side, and tells
Susan she should have tried to stop her sister

00:07:17.569 --> 00:07:23.259
from hitting Ralphie and since she didn't,
she is guilty too, but um keep in mind she

00:07:23.259 --> 00:07:25.210
can barely fucking walk.

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:30.620
As punishment for doing nothing, she puts
Susan on the side of the bed and starts spanking

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:31.620
her.

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:36.289
Meg comes in for her sister but is held down
by the boys.

00:07:36.289 --> 00:07:39.229
She then steals Megs ring that was her mothers.

00:07:39.229 --> 00:07:44.479
I know David's young and now is the time to
at least tell mom and dad back home.

00:07:44.479 --> 00:07:50.010
Also, these kids know this abuse isn't right,
because a couple days later, Donny and David

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:54.120
see Meg talking to a police officer about
that beating.

00:07:54.120 --> 00:08:00.210
Well later, David gets out of the house to
see Meg and Susan sitting fearful and absorbed.

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:03.659
Willie then walks in and slaps Meg for bringing
a cop around.

00:08:03.659 --> 00:08:09.360
Looks like the cop didn't think it was too
serious though, and Ruth completely terrifies

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:14.379
the two girls making them know that no cop
or man will save them.

00:08:14.379 --> 00:08:18.460
She hen sends them to their room so she can
reflect on punishment.

00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:22.979
Well later at dinner, David wants to sleep
over at Aunt Ruth's house, maybe he wants

00:08:22.979 --> 00:08:25.020
to help out any way he can.

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:31.020
At night, David sneaks into Aunt Ruth's house,
going down into the basement, but sees Ruth

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:35.520
and the boys in front of a bound, gagged and
blinded Meg.

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:40.860
Turns out they are playing "The Game" with
Meg, which is basically force her to answer

00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:42.560
vulgar questions.

00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:47.579
She has a gag in her mouth, but unfairly,
since she wont confess to stuff she hasn't

00:08:47.579 --> 00:08:52.529
done before like sex or anything, they take
all the books from under her feet.

00:08:52.529 --> 00:08:58.310
Struggling to stand, her only voice of reason
is given by David, but the boys relish in

00:08:58.310 --> 00:09:01.120
the fact that they have permission to do this.

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:03.769
Willie then goes up and threatens her with
the knife.

00:09:03.769 --> 00:09:09.040
He then completely removes all her clothes
and then take her gag off so she can answer

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:10.940
their vulgar questions.

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:13.710
Questions like how she plays with herself
and the such.

00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:18.839
She asks if David's here and Susan who are
the only ones with some empathy.

00:09:18.839 --> 00:09:23.810
Ruth tells the thirsty boys to not touch someone
like Meg who is dirty and whoreish.

00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:30.089
They ptu the dirty gag back in and then Ruth
tells her it could be her little sister here

00:09:30.089 --> 00:09:31.120
hanging.

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:36.410
She is saying either confess your slut experiences,
or Susan gets the turn.

00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:39.820
Then we see all the boys who cant sleep.

00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:44.790
Willie wonders what it feels like to be bound
like Meg, and so in curiosity, they go to

00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:46.490
see how Meg is doing.

00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:51.290
They give her some much needed and water and
promises to loosen her up if she lets them

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:52.290
touch her.

00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:56.509
David then loosens her ropes, and leaves before
Ruth wakes back up.

00:09:56.509 --> 00:10:02.649
Later, we see Ruth trying to feed Meg, but
Meg is so dehydrated that any attempt at eating

00:10:02.649 --> 00:10:04.370
will cause her to choke.

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:11.230
Meg can barely raise her voice or hold this
cup of tea and Ruth knocks it away in anger.

00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:16.230
Blaming Meg for the mess, she gets the boys
to hold her down and gets Susan to beat her

00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:18.589
as punishment for Megs mistake.

00:10:18.589 --> 00:10:22.500
Well suddenly David wakes up, but that wasn't
a nightmare.

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:26.790
In the morning, David then rides on his bike
to get back to Grove Street.

00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:31.589
Well really its to go help his dad at work,
which is the opportunity David takes to ask

00:10:31.589 --> 00:10:33.870
his dad if its every okay to hit girls.

00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:39.269
Dad says hell naw basically and its best to
never hit anybody unless its all you got left!

00:10:39.269 --> 00:10:42.710
Then we see sweet little Susan building a
puzzle.

00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:47.149
David comes in and tells her that he cant
make them stop, but would if he could.

00:10:47.149 --> 00:10:50.240
Then they hear some noises from Meg.

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:55.810
David goes downstairs and sees all the neighbor
kids bullying Meg and treating her less than

00:10:55.810 --> 00:10:56.810
human.

00:10:56.810 --> 00:10:57.810
Donny then ties her back up and gets a feel
on, but leaves when he hears something.

00:10:57.810 --> 00:11:02.120
David then gets out of his hiding spot to
see what he can do to help, but get this guys,

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:06.250
Ruth, somehow, knows instant transmission,
either that or she was trained in stealth

00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:08.279
by Sam Fisher himself.

00:11:08.279 --> 00:11:12.970
Well later than night, David goes into his
parents room to tell his mom, but she was

00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:15.449
having too good of a dream to listen.

00:11:15.449 --> 00:11:21.519
Well later we see the family torture Meg again,
including cutting her around her stomach.

00:11:21.519 --> 00:11:25.209
Ruth burns the wounds by sticking cigarettes
in the wounds.

00:11:25.209 --> 00:11:29.980
Suddenly, the door bell rings and Ruth sends
the boys to answer.

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:35.149
In an attempt to get her to leave, David tells
her to not let the boys handle it and offers

00:11:35.149 --> 00:11:41.220
to watch her, but Ruth says if one sound is
made, David and Meg will die.

00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:46.279
Well the person at the door was a police officer,
who does that stereotypical suspicious walk

00:11:46.279 --> 00:11:50.300
around a guilty persons home he keeps acting
innocent.

00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:56.149
Downstairs, David whispers to Meg that tonight
has to be the night that she escape and just

00:11:56.149 --> 00:11:58.470
come back for Susan later.

00:11:58.470 --> 00:12:04.019
Upstairs the officer says he got reports of
Meg being abused, but Ruth successfully gets

00:12:04.019 --> 00:12:06.399
the officer to not believe those facts.

00:12:06.399 --> 00:12:10.060
The boys come downstairs blaming David for
squealing but he comes up with an excuse.

00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:12.509
Later, David comes back to sneak a flashlight.

00:12:12.509 --> 00:12:17.019
He suspense fully walks down the stairs as
a suspicious Ruth listens.

00:12:17.019 --> 00:12:19.410
He makes a break for it when the phone rings.

00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:26.290
David tries to untie the heavily bruised,
dehydrated and hungry Meg and gives her money.

00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:30.300
She rejects the money because it could get
her in trouble, so instead he gives her a

00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:33.410
small blade just in case and departs to see
if she can escape.

00:12:33.410 --> 00:12:34.410
David hides the money under a rock that both
Meg and him are familiar with and then later

00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:35.410
that night he watches to see if she escapes,
but she doesn't.

00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:36.410
He then notices his hidden money I still there,
showing she definitely didn't leave.

00:12:36.410 --> 00:12:38.980
David then goes to the house and Donny tells
him to close the door.

00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:45.790
Downstairs, Ruth, the neighborhood kids and
Susan watch as Meg is raped by Willie.

00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:49.029
Ruth says that's all she's good for when the
act is finished.

00:12:49.029 --> 00:12:54.510
They force David to watch basically and Ruth
tells a mentally broken Susan wanting her

00:12:54.510 --> 00:12:56.850
mom to shut the fuck up.

00:12:56.850 --> 00:12:59.330
Ruth then asks who wants to rape her next.

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:05.019
Donny offers to but Ruth says no because it
would be like incest to rape her with his

00:13:05.019 --> 00:13:07.370
brothers semen inside her.

00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:12.389
Everybody else wants to cut her, putting a
message on her so people know she is a whore.

00:13:12.389 --> 00:13:15.959
Ruth heats up a bobby pin as everybody holds
back David.

00:13:15.959 --> 00:13:23.120
Ruth then takes the heated bobby pin and writes
the words I Fuck before abruptly cutting away.

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:29.839
The deed is over now and Ruth smiles as Meg's
body is mutilated so she cant get a man ever.

00:13:29.839 --> 00:13:34.720
We see the message itself and Ruth says that
meg aint done with her punishment.

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:41.040
Next, Ruth wants to remove her clitoris to
also remove any pleasure she could ever get.

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:46.399
David then runs away, but is easily caught
and tied up to witness Ruth mutilate Megs

00:13:46.399 --> 00:13:48.720
vagina with a blow torch.

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:52.029
David must have passed out, because he then
wakes back up in the basement.

00:13:52.029 --> 00:13:57.790
He gets himself loose and goes to see Meg,
who is having the life pulled away from her

00:13:57.790 --> 00:13:59.440
but is still alive.

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:05.069
Susan then asks David if he hates her and
obviously he says of course not but she says

00:14:05.069 --> 00:14:06.069
he should.

00:14:06.069 --> 00:14:11.350
Susan says its all her fault this happened,
because Meg did try to escape the previous

00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:12.350
night, but her need to take her sister with
her got her caught.

00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:17.029
Meg definitely didn't want to leave her sister
because Susan herself was being molested by

00:14:17.029 --> 00:14:19.829
Ruth, to the point that there was bleeding.

00:14:19.829 --> 00:14:25.120
Meg then finally wakes up, barely able to
utter any word but it hurts.

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:28.899
To help get them out, David starts a fire
in the basement.

00:14:28.899 --> 00:14:34.889
When Ruth comes down to see, David knocks
her out with Susan's crutches and then kills

00:14:34.889 --> 00:14:38.920
Ruth with some nasty sounding hits before
getting tackled by Donny.

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:44.459
Willie then comes to beat David and holds
a knife to his neck, but right before he cuts

00:14:44.459 --> 00:14:46.420
the police show up clutch!

00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:51.779
They take the boys away and the officer finds
out what happened from a scarred and sad David.

00:14:51.779 --> 00:14:57.860
The officer carries Susan away and David lays
next to a dying Meg to hear her last words.

00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:03.040
Meg asks him if he can get her mother's ring
back from that demon on the floor which David

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:04.519
yanks off.

00:15:04.519 --> 00:15:09.009
Then after some more words expressing her
confusion on how anybody could do this to

00:15:09.009 --> 00:15:11.850
another person, she passes on.

00:15:11.850 --> 00:15:16.950
Well with that sad recap over, we cut back
to the present as David mourns the memory

00:15:16.950 --> 00:15:18.040
of Meg.

00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:22.850
The movie ends as David walks to where he
used to collect crayfish, recounting that

00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:26.939
Meg taught him something, that its what you
do last that counts.

00:15:26.939 --> 00:15:32.230
Well yes it was clearly a disturbing film,
but it should hit that it was a movie reflected

00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:33.899
from real life.

00:15:33.899 --> 00:15:38.709
Even though these movies are messed up, I
am a firm believer that real life can be even

00:15:38.709 --> 00:15:39.709
more disturbing.

00:15:39.709 --> 00:15:44.540
Now that we seen The Girl Next Door, lets
talk about the most disturbed moment and most

00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:46.879
enjoyed moment in that Spooky Stuff!

00:15:46.879 --> 00:15:54.850
So back when I had a series called Nite Shorts,
which is a series where I just talked about

00:15:54.850 --> 00:16:00.699
big crimes, I was going to make a video about
Sylvia Likens because it is truly a disturbing

00:16:00.699 --> 00:16:02.399
crime that just speaks evil.

00:16:02.399 --> 00:16:07.580
If I were to name one crime that was probably
more disturbing than this one, it would be

00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:09.569
the similar murder of Junko Furuta.

00:16:09.569 --> 00:16:16.480
In fact the man who authored the Mai Chans
Daily Life manga also made a manga about the

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:22.999
Junko Furuta crime and let me tell you guys
nothing has ever shocked me more than that

00:16:22.999 --> 00:16:23.999
manga.

00:16:23.999 --> 00:16:28.980
Okay anyway, the most disturbed moment of
this movie is probably the scene of the branding.

00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:35.209
The rape is a close second but the branding
put you up close to a girls suffering to where

00:16:35.209 --> 00:16:37.509
you had to turn away.

00:16:37.509 --> 00:16:40.879
Gladly though they didn't show the blowtorch
mutilation.

00:16:40.879 --> 00:16:45.100
The most enjoyed moment is hard to pick because
we don't see lots of good things happening,

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:48.480
but I'd say it was all the times David and
Meg were together.

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:51.449
I just wish Meg could have kept that smile
more.

00:16:51.449 --> 00:16:55.350
