00:00:00.489 --> 00:00:07.459
Story Recapped here.

00:00:07.459 --> 00:00:12.759
Today I am going to explain another supernatural
film called "It Follows."

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:19.130
This one is a 2014 horror, mystery, and thriller
written and directed by David Robert Mitchell.

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.960
Before we begin, let me give you a spoiler
alert.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:30.740
Watch out and take care.

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:36.340
The story begins with Jaime Height or Jay,
a 19-year-old college student who is the film's

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.090
main protagonist.

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:43.730
She is a student at Oakland University, and
for the teenager, autumn should be about school,

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.370
boys and weekends out at the lake.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:51.400
Jay decides to go on a date with her kind
but mysterious new boyfriend, Hugh.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:56.060
That night, Hugh shows Jay a young girl in
the back of the theatre, but Jaime tells him

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.210
she cannot see any girl.

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.630
This makes Hugh disturbed and distressed.

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:04.510
He becomes unnerved and asks Jamie that they
leave.

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:10.030
After that, they decide to go on another date,
and this time Hugh and Jay have sex in his

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.119
car, and this is where the story starts to
get more serious.

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:20.009
Everything goes well until later when Hugh
is seen using chloroform to incapacitate Jay.

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.390
She wakes up in the Packard Plant, tied to
a wheelchair.

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.520
Here, Hugh has become like a stranger, and
he explains to Jay that she will be followed

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.630
and pursued by an entity.

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.810
So, this is all that they tell us in the movie
description.

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.399
"A young girl is followed by an unknown supernatural
force after a sexual encounter."

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:45.470
Further, Hugh tells Jay that this entity can
only be seen by them, and it can take the

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.889
appearance of any person.

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:53.329
He tells her that somebody had given it to
him and now he has passed it on to her.

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:58.399
It will follow her everywhere, and once it
catches her, it will kill her and pursue the

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:01.829
previous person who had passed it on, that
is Hugh.

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:06.859
So, that means Jay needs to pass it on to
somebody else before it gets her.

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:11.500
At the Packard Plant, both of them see a naked
woman walking toward them.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:12.500
They panic.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.730
Hugh takes Jay, drops her off outside her
home, flees, and abandons her.

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:23.930
Now, Jay realizes that she is the latest recipient
of a curse that's fatal and is passed on from

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.490
victim to victim through sexual intercourse.

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.830
A "thing" is now following her.

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.910
Throughout the course of the movie, Jay slowly
finds herself plagued by strange, freakish

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:35.990
visions.

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:40.690
She gets the inescapable sense of someone
or something following her.

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:45.790
It can look like a stranger or someone she
knows, only she can see it, and she dies if

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.500
it ever catches her.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.850
She now knows that death will relentlessly
creep toward her, and she has got to find

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:53.760
a way to stop it.

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.520
The next day, as per complaints, the police
investigate, but they cannot find the naked

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.200
woman or Hugh.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.630
He was living under a false identity, and
we can guess that his only aim was to find

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.850
someone to pass on the curse he had gotten
into.

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:13.410
By now, Jay has begun to have more nightmarish
visions and encounters with that "something."

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:19.160
At school, she sees an old woman walking towards
her, wearing a hospital gown, and this woman

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.450
was obviously invisible to others.

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.390
Jay is terrified.

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:29.480
Her sister Kelly, and her friends, Paul Bolduan
and Yara Davis, agree to help her even though

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.490
they don't believe in her seemingly paranoid
ravings that appear gibberish to them.

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:39.960
Despite having any evidence of this creature's
existence, her friends decide to support her.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:44.080
Paul and Yara spend the night in Jay and Kelly's
home with them.

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.680
That night, they hear someone smashing the
kitchen window.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:53.480
While Paul goes to find out what that was,
Jay, who is inside the house, sees a scruffy,

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.620
bedraggled, urinating, half-naked woman walking
towards her.

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:02.740
Horror-stricken Jay runs upstairs to the others
who cannot see the wobbly woman.

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:07.660
She then sees another entity, this time a
tall man, entering the bedroom.

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.060
Jay flees the house.

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.310
Her friends follow and catch up to her at
a nearby playground.

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:18.500
Jay's friends had not believed her at first,
but later they too begin to see and feel the

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:23.969
phantom assassins trying to intimidate and
terrorize the hell out of their friend.

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:29.599
Now they all band together to face this burden
and help defend each other, especially Jay.

00:04:29.599 --> 00:04:34.449
They must now together find a way to escape
the horrors that seem to be only a very few

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:36.590
steps behind.

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:41.520
They begin with finding out who Hugh really
is, or maybe, was.

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:46.120
They get their neighbor Greg Hannigan's help
and discover that Hugheâ€™s real name is Jeff

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.160
Redmond.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.710
They decide to trace him to his address.

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:53.470
When Jeff's mother answers the door, Jay is
dumbfounded.

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:55.440
She recognizes that face.

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.910
It clicks, and she realizes that the naked
woman who had followed her and Jeff at Packard

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:01.949
Plant had the same look.

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:05.860
It had apparently taken the form of Jeff's
mom, Mrs. Redmond.

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:07.370
They have a talk.

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:11.370
Jeff tells them that the entity had begun
pursuing him after a one-night stand with

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:12.540
someone.

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:17.360
He assures Jay that she can pass it on by
having sex with someone else.

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:23.389
Later that day, good man Greg drives Jay,
Kelly, Yara, and Paul to his family's lake

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:24.389
house.

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:32.099
There, he . While spending time on the lakefront,
the entity once again appears, and this time

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:34.409
it has taken the form of Yara.

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:35.500
It attacks Jay.

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:40.050
Her friends come running and break a chair
over its body, and Jay shoots it in the head.

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:44.830
They think they have gotten rid of it, but
to their horror, the thing recovers unharmed

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:47.349
and once again attacks Jay.

00:05:47.349 --> 00:05:51.150
Now it has taken the form of a boy who lives
next door to Jay.

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:53.610
She did not have the strength to fight it
again.

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:58.319
She gets into Greg's car, drives blindly,
and crashes into a cornfield.

00:05:58.319 --> 00:06:02.979
What Jay remembers next is waking up in a
hospital with a broken arm.

00:06:02.979 --> 00:06:04.879
Her friends go to visit her.

00:06:04.879 --> 00:06:08.210
Something unexpected and surprising happens
here at the hospital.

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:14.400
Greg, who comes to see Jay, says that he does
not believe in the existence of any such entity.

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:18.409
Saying so, he has sex with Jay right at the
hospital.

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:20.559
Days passed after the incident.

00:06:20.559 --> 00:06:23.639
Next time Jay sees the entity in the form
of Greg.

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:28.629
Now that she had passed on the curse to Greg,
it was following Greg and not her.

00:06:28.629 --> 00:06:34.449
The entity in the form of Greg itself walks
towards his house, smashes a window, and enters.

00:06:34.449 --> 00:06:39.249
Jay, who has seen all this happening, tries
to warn the real Greg.

00:06:39.249 --> 00:06:41.969
She telephones him, but he does not answer.

00:06:41.969 --> 00:06:45.960
Jay knows she has got to do something, so
she runs to his house.

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:49.180
She sees that the entity has changed its form
again.

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:52.150
It now looks like Greg's mother, half-naked.

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:54.710
She knocks on his door and attacks him.

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:59.870
Everything happens so suddenly, and stupefied,
Jay watches the entity having sex with a dead

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:00.900
Greg.

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:02.960
She flees by car.

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:05.879
Jay is once again in a lot of horrors.

00:07:05.879 --> 00:07:09.849
Now that the entity had killed Greg, she knew
that it would go back to the person who had

00:07:09.849 --> 00:07:11.629
passed it on to him.

00:07:11.629 --> 00:07:15.960
Fully knowing that it was her, she realized
it might have already begun to follow her

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:17.490
all again.

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:20.180
Jay decides to spend that night outdoors.

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:24.400
She drives to a beach, and there she notices
three young men on a boat.

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:27.569
Jay gets undressed and walks into the water.

00:07:27.569 --> 00:07:30.289
In the next scene, Jay is back home.

00:07:30.289 --> 00:07:34.680
Her friend Paul is with her, and he is surprisingly
ready to take the risk.

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:40.069
Paul offers Jaime the opportunity to pass
on her curse to him, but she refuses.

00:07:40.069 --> 00:07:44.719
Their group once again gets together, knowing
that it was now or never.

00:07:44.719 --> 00:07:47.680
After a lot of thinking, they come up with
a plan.

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:50.710
It was to kill the evil using electric shock.

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:55.919
Paul, Jay, Kelly, and Yara break into an indoor
public pool.

00:07:55.919 --> 00:08:01.050
They plug in dozens of electrical appliances
like hairdryers, televisions, toaster ovens,

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:03.509
and more, all around the pool.

00:08:03.509 --> 00:08:07.779
They would first lure the creature into the
swimming pool, keeping Jay as a bait, and

00:08:07.779 --> 00:08:12.490
then drop the electrical devices into the
water to electrocute and end it.

00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:15.999
It was then time to come together for their
last fight.

00:08:15.999 --> 00:08:20.490
This is where we enter into the film's thrilling
and terrifying climax.

00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:23.599
Everyone and everything was set and ready.

00:08:23.599 --> 00:08:27.039
Jay waits in the swimming pool and indeed
spots her enemy.

00:08:27.039 --> 00:08:31.309
To her shock, it had taken the form of someone
whom she had not foreseen.

00:08:31.309 --> 00:08:33.589
It looked like her deceased father.

00:08:33.589 --> 00:08:37.930
Though it is not clearly mentioned in the
movie who "it" impersonates during the climax,

00:08:37.930 --> 00:08:41.289
theories suggest that it was Jay's dead dad.

00:08:41.289 --> 00:08:45.930
Jay's distress is clearly seen on her face,
and when her sister Kelly asks her what she

00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:49.630
sees, Jay replies, "I don't want to tell you."

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:54.220
We can see that the entity is a middle-aged
man with a beard, and we also know that it

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:57.400
can take the form of the loved ones of its
victims.

00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:02.050
It might not click to you at first, but the
pictures in Jay's home have this same bearded

00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:03.050
man.

00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:05.070
So, Jay has to kill her dad.

00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:10.070
Though it is traumatic, she knows she has
to fight it because she has got no choice.

00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:13.880
Her friends are all ready for action, but
things don't go according to what they had

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:14.880
planned.

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:18.250
It seemed that the enemy had eavesdropped
on their plan.

00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:22.840
Instead of entering the pool, it hurls the
electrical devices into the pool.

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:24.670
Jay was the one in the water.

00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:27.389
Some of the appliances collide with her and
draw blood.

00:09:27.389 --> 00:09:31.790
While Jay was struggling with hurt and trying
to stay afloat, her friends, who couldn't

00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:35.399
wait and watch their friend in the hands of
death, intervene.

00:09:35.399 --> 00:09:36.519
They begin their fight.

00:09:36.519 --> 00:09:42.240
It was going to be tough and startling as
they were to fight an enemy invisible to them.

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:47.240
In the middle of all that mess, Paul fires
at invisible targets where he thinks the creature

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:48.240
is.

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:53.490
He ends up shooting the entity but also in
the process.

00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:57.779
Once shot, Kelly somehow manages to throw
a sheet over its head so that it could be

00:09:57.779 --> 00:09:59.110
shot in the head.

00:09:59.110 --> 00:10:02.670
Paul hits it once again, and the entity falls
into the pool.

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:08.410
Meanwhile, Jay, who is in the pool, is still
shocked by everything that was happening.

00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:13.899
As she tries to swim out, the creature grabs
her and begins to pull helpless Jay underwater.

00:10:13.899 --> 00:10:16.220
Paul manages to shoot it again.

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:18.620
That gives Jay some time to escape.

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:22.899
As she swims away from her curse, she sees
the pool turning red with blood.

00:10:22.899 --> 00:10:26.009
The creature seems to be dead and defeated.

00:10:26.009 --> 00:10:30.769
Now that they have won the war, Jay and Paul
get intimate after they are home.

00:10:30.769 --> 00:10:35.620
We may think that it's all over and that Jay
and Paul would have a happily ever after.

00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:37.959
But things take a dramatic turn.

00:10:37.959 --> 00:10:42.389
After their night together, Paul is seen slowly
driving past prostitutes.

00:10:42.389 --> 00:10:47.580
This tells us that Paul considers the possibility
of "it" coming back and following him.

00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:52.370
In the movie's last scene, Paul and Jay are
walking down the road hand in hand while a

00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:56.800
shadowy something is seen slowly approaching
them from behind.

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:58.060
That's where the film ends.

00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:03.130
So, as you can see, the director has given
his movie an open ending and has left it to

00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:04.330
us.

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:09.510
Looking at its conclusion and how the film
was both a critical and commercial success,

00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:12.930
one might expect a sequel of "It Follows."

00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:17.839
In an interview with Vulture, the director
of the film David Robert Mitchell said that

00:11:17.839 --> 00:11:22.980
he settled on this ending so that people could
make up their own stories about what it means.

00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:32.630
