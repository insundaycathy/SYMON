the running for it i think

00:11:52.629 --> 00:11:52.639 align:start position:0%
all that remains is for someone else to
 

00:11:52.639 --> 00:11:54.069 align:start position:0%
all that remains is for someone else to

00:11:54.069 --> 00:11:54.079 align:start position:0%
take over the position
 

00:11:54.079 --> 00:11:55.750 align:start position:0%
take over the position
therefore<00:11:54.480><c> i</c><00:11:54.639><c> think</c><00:11:54.800><c> that</c><00:11:54.959><c> a</c><00:11:55.120><c> mana</c><00:11:55.360><c> deal</c><00:11:55.519><c> will</c>

therefore i think that a mana deal will
 

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:58.230 align:start position:0%
therefore i think that a mana deal will
