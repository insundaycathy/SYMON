00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.160
Welcome back to another movie recap.

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:05.920
Today, I'm going to give you an&nbsp;
overview of a film called 'Peninsula'.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:09.040
There will be Spoilers ahead,&nbsp;
so please proceed with caution.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.680
In South Korea, a zombie epidemic erupts, and&nbsp;
the government is overwhelmed in a single day.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.240
Captain Jung-seok of the Korean Marine&nbsp;
Corps transports his family on a ship.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.880
He passes a couple with a little girl on the&nbsp;
way, but he ignores their cries for aid since&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.360
the guy is bleeding. Jung-family seok's&nbsp;
board a ship where a zombie afflicted guy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:32.400
infects many others in a stateroom, including&nbsp;
Jung-nephew seok's Dong-hwan. Because Jung-sister&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.040
seok's will not leave Dong-hwan, Jung-seok&nbsp;
seals off the cabin as zombies attack her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.000
As armed troops approach, Jung-seok stops&nbsp;
his brother-in-law Chul-min from entering.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.920
South Korea has been quarantined by&nbsp;
other countries to limit the spread.

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:51.520
Four years later, in Hong Kong, a guilt-ridden&nbsp;
Jung-seok and Chul-min are recruited by Chinese&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.680
mobsters for a mission with two other Koreans&nbsp;
to travel to South Korea and collect a truck&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.640
holding US$20 million, with the promise of&nbsp;
receiving half of the money if they succeed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.880
The squad gets on the peninsula by boat&nbsp;
late at night and discovers the vehicle.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.000
The squad fends off and kills the zombie truck&nbsp;
driver, causing additional zombies to appear.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.440
The squad flees when&nbsp;
Jung-seok shoots many of them.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:19.120
On their journey back to Incheon Port, the crew&nbsp;
is assaulted by Unit 631, a renegade militia&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:24.640
that utilises light to lure additional zombies,&nbsp;
causing the squad's vehicles to collapse. Chul-min&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.360
hides in the vehicle as Jung-seok is thrown&nbsp;
out. The other members of the team are slain,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:35.280
one by the accident and the other by Sergeant&nbsp;
Hwang of Unit 631. Jung-seok is saved in a car&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.000
by two sisters: Joon, a talented driver who&nbsp;
can manipulate and kill zombies, and young&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.640
Yu-jin. They rejoin their grandfather Elder&nbsp;
Kim and mother Min-jung in their hideaway.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.680
Min-jung and Yu-jin were members of the family&nbsp;
Jung-Seok declined to aid four years ago.

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:56.560
Meanwhile, Unit 631 drives the vehicle back&nbsp;
to their base. They confine Chul-min and force&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.840
him to participate in two-minute survival games&nbsp;
against unarmed zombies. Private Kim discovers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.640
the money in the truck and notifies Captain Seo,&nbsp;
who calls the mobsters and devises a plan to flee&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:12.400
the peninsula with the vehicle while keeping the&nbsp;
plot hidden from the rest of Unit 631. Meanwhile,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.560
Min-jung learns from Jung-seok that the mobsters'&nbsp;
ship is ready to pick him up and the truck in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:22.080

the vehicle the following evening.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.720

holding Private Kim at gunpoint, and interrupts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.840
a survival game to save him, killing numerous&nbsp;
zombies and Unit 631 troops in the process.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.480
Sergeant Hwang murders Chul-min after&nbsp;
he protects Jung-seok from being bitten.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.840
Captain Seo is defeated by Min-jung,&nbsp;
who saves Jung-seok from Unit 631.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.280
In the vehicle, Min-jung and Jung-seok attempt&nbsp;
to flee the property, but are stopped by zombies.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.960

to distract the zombies and liberate the truck.

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.320

vehicles, as zombies attack the humans.&nbsp;&nbsp;

family and Jung-seok successfully destroy the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:14.160

at Incheon Port after killing Private Kim. He has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:20.160

order to release Joon. Elder Kim guards Yu-jin,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.720
while Seo shoots him. Seo shoots Min-jung in&nbsp;
the leg and flees to the ship in his truck.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.480
Seo is betrayed by the mobsters, who shoot&nbsp;
him. Seo reverses the vehicle as he dies,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.400
allowing the zombies outside to enter the&nbsp;
ship's cargo hold and murder the mobsters.

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:40.240
Elder Kim passes away. A passing United Nations&nbsp;
Chinook chopper is signalled by the family.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:45.360

create a route for Jung-seok, Joon, and Yu-jin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:50.320
