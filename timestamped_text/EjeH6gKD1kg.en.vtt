00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:14.000
Hi guys, Korean Movie Recapped here. Before&nbsp;
we start, WARNING! Spoilers Ahead! Today,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.200
I’m going to recap a 2011 Thailand Drama&nbsp;
Biographical movie, called The Billionaire.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.520
This movie tells the story of a young&nbsp;
entrepreneur in building his snack empire,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.640
Tao Kae Noi. He was determined to establish the&nbsp;
company to help his parents pay off their debts.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:34.320
So, what are the problems that he faced? How&nbsp;
can he have achieved it? Let’s find it out.&nbsp;

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:40.080
At the start of the movie, we are introduced to&nbsp;
Top, a 19-year-old boy who wants to take a loan&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:45.280
of 10 million Thailand Baht, or around&nbsp;
300 thousand USD, to make a factory.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.760
The Bank Manager asked him the reason he should&nbsp;
lend the money. He then explains about his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:55.120
history. When in high school, he loves to play&nbsp;
games and get a lot of money from it. He starts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.720
with selling an in-game item for 12,000 Baht.&nbsp;
Then, he buys a car by selling more rare items.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.640
His parents don’t agree about it and ask him&nbsp;
to focus on high school. After graduating, he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.840
fails in getting into a public university. But he&nbsp;
doesn’t care about it and continues to play games.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.160
Due to the ease of getting the money,&nbsp;
he spends it lavishly on electronics.&nbsp;

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:22.400
One day, his parents ask him to apply for a&nbsp;
private university which is expensive. He also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.520
overhears his parents complaining about facing a&nbsp;
financial problem. He cannot help them because his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.920
game account has been blocked due to commercial&nbsp;
activities and he doesn’t have much savings left.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:37.360
Determined to help his parents, he tries to&nbsp;
resell DVD players with his remaining savings.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.120
Unfortunately, he fails because&nbsp;
he was tricked by the supplier.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.560
Seeing that Top has failed, his Father recommends&nbsp;
him to enter university and abandon his business.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.280
Father gives him money to enter the&nbsp;
private university, but he refuses.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.200
Because he doesn’t want to be dependent&nbsp;
on his troubled parents. At night,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.000
he steals one of Father’s jewelry and pawns it&nbsp;
with a promise that he will buy it back later.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.600
He uses the money to enter a private university.
While studying, Top skips his class and goes to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:11.120
a food processor exhibition. There, he rented an&nbsp;
automatic peanut cooker to open a new business.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.800
He learns how to cook peanuts from a seller and&nbsp;
implements it. Turns out, his food is delicious.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.160
Then, Top and his Uncle open a tenant in a&nbsp;
mall. There, they fail because there is no&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.920
customer buying. After trying several locations,&nbsp;
sales go up and Top starts to hire some staff.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.120
Top’s Girlfriend reminds him to come back and&nbsp;
focus on his study, but he is still determined&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.720
on building a business. Because of his absence,&nbsp;
he dropped out of his university. To add to his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.840
problem, his business also fails because the smoke&nbsp;
from the peanut cooking process pollutes the mall.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.200
His parents ask him to go to China with&nbsp;
them to start a new life. However, he is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.760
still determined to be a businessman, and pay his&nbsp;
family’s debt so that they may stay in Thailand.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.680
After some consideration, his&nbsp;
parents leave him and go to China.&nbsp;

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.960
Then, Top finds that his house has been&nbsp;
collateralized for a bank loan and is about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:08.000
to be seized. When he is feeling down, he meets&nbsp;
Girlfriend who is angry because he hasn’t been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.280
replying to her messages. While he is taking her&nbsp;
home, she brings out fried seaweed that she bought&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.640
from overseas. The seaweed is delicious and he&nbsp;
wants to sell this product for his next business.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:24.160
He asks a Professor on how to preserve the&nbsp;
fried seaweed in a package. Professor explains&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.880
that he has to use a vacuum machine to suck the&nbsp;
oxygen out of the package and kill the bacteria.&nbsp;

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:35.200
Determined to start his new business, he sells his&nbsp;
automatic peanut cooker and buys new materials and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:41.200
tools. Unluckily, his first attempt fails.&nbsp;
The fried seaweed always tastes bitter.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.720
He sells his electronics to buy more raw seaweed.&nbsp;
Even though Uncle frequently persuades Top to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.680
follow his parents to China, he still doesn’t&nbsp;
lose hope in establishing a business. During&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.640
their attempt at making a delicious recipe, Uncle&nbsp;
got into an accident and had to be hospitalized.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:02.480
That night, a package fell on the floor and rain&nbsp;
poured on it. Top continues his attempt without&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:08.160
Uncle but also meets no luck. When he runs out of&nbsp;
stock, he tries to fry the rain-drenched seaweed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.560
He finds the seaweed delicious because&nbsp;
of the water moisture inside the package.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.920
He brings it to Uncle and Uncle also likes it.
After Uncle has recovered, they start to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:23.280
sell the fried seaweed and succeed. Top sets a&nbsp;
personal sales target of 1 million Baht a year.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.480
When his parents call, he finds out that the&nbsp;
family’s debt is actually 40 million Baht,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:33.120
or 1.2 million USD. He got desperate&nbsp;
because of the shocking number.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.000
He listens to some motivational records to&nbsp;
boost his morale and gets back to his feet.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:43.760
When visiting 7-Eleven, he realizes that he can&nbsp;
sell his snacks in the shop to boost his sales.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.720
The next day, he visits 7-Eleven’s office&nbsp;
and pitches his product to the Director.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:54.000
The Director rejects his proposal because his&nbsp;
package design is so poor and the price is too&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.120
expensive. Once more faced with disappointment,&nbsp;
Girlfriend tries to cheer him up and says that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:04.480
her parents can help his financial problems.&nbsp;
Due to his integrity, he rejects the offer.&nbsp;

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:08.880
The next day, Top asks a local&nbsp;
designer to design his product’s wrap.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:14.000
Designer says that the products' name, Tao&nbsp;
Kae Noi, which means (Young Entrepreneur),&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.280
is good enough and needs no adjustment. After&nbsp;
he repackages his product, he brings it to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:24.080
office once more to show to the Director.&nbsp;
However, the Director is very busy that day&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:29.920
and he is left waiting. He finally surrenders and&nbsp;
gives his snack to the office’s security. He also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:35.360
calls Mother to inform that he is coming to China.
Luckily, his product is loved by 7-Eleven’s staff.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.120
The office invites Top to an appointment with the&nbsp;
Boards. In the meeting, the Director commends him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:47.280
for making a delicious snack. The Director also&nbsp;
adds that he has to produce 72,000 packages for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:52.240
6,000 branches to be a partner. His factory&nbsp;
will also be inspected for hygiene concerns.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:57.760
He agrees to the requirements and comes to a&nbsp;
bank. Turns out, he applies for a 10 million&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:02.720
Baht loan to fund his new factory. The Bank&nbsp;
Manager congratulates him for making it so far.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:08.160
But he rejects Top’s proposal because he is still&nbsp;
19 years old and his family has a huge debt.

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:15.280
Again, this time Top still pushes forward. He uses&nbsp;
his parents’ old shop which is in the process of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:20.480
being confiscated by the Bank. He sells his car&nbsp;
to fill his new factory and hires new staff.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:25.200
When he is shopping, he finds that his&nbsp;
Girlfriend is already with someone else.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:30.720
He is saddened because his Girlfriend was so kind&nbsp;
and caring. After much preparation, the factory&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:35.840
is ready and the Director comes with an Inspector.&nbsp;
They are unsatisfied with the factory’s sanitation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:40.640
and see that Top is unfit. The Director says that&nbsp;
they will discuss first and the result will be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:45.600
sent later. After they have fixed the factory’s&nbsp;
problems, Top gets approval from the Director.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.520
He is overjoyed and ramps up his&nbsp;
production to meet the required number.&nbsp;

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:56.000
When preparing for delivery, Top hugs Uncle and&nbsp;
expresses his gratitude. He also says that if they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.800
fail again this time, he will follow his parents’&nbsp;
will to study and live in China, because he has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:06.080
sold everything for the business. When he arrives&nbsp;
at the warehouse, the Warehouse Manager says that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:10.880
his delivery is one hour late and cannot be&nbsp;
accepted. He begs to him and says that he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:16.320
has sacrificed a lot for this. The Warehouse&nbsp;
Manager pities him and accepts his packages.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:20.560
Feeling relieved, he calls his parents to say&nbsp;
that they can finally come home to Thailand.&nbsp;

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:26.960
At the end of the movie, we are informed that&nbsp;
2 years after the co-operation with 7-Eleven,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:31.760
Top pays off his parents’ debt of 40 million&nbsp;
Baht and can re-occupy the house together.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:37.440
Top also applies for a loan of 400 million&nbsp;
Baht to expand his factory. In 2010,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:44.560
Top has 2,500 employees. He sends his products to&nbsp;
6,000 7-Eleven branches, and exports his seaweed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:50.480
snack to 27 countries around the world. Top&nbsp;
also owns a seaweed plantation in South Korea,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:58.000
and generates 1.5 billion Baht (45 million&nbsp;
USD) in sales at the age of 26 years old.&nbsp;
