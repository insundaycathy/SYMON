Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:05.959
Today, I'm going to explain a horror, sci-fi,
thriller film called “The Mist.”

00:00:05.959 --> 00:00:07.249
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:08.980
Watch out and take care.

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:14.120
On a gloomy morning in a small rural town
in Maine, David, an illustrator, examines

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.140
the aftermath of a freak thunderstorm that
happened the previous night.

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.869
An old tree had broken through their window,
and his son, Billy, calls David and his wife

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.759
Steff to see the lakehouse had been destroyed
too.

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:29.179
David sees that a tree from their neighbor’s
yard had fallen onto the lakehouse.

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:32.800
The family spots a sizeable amount of mist
coming down from the mountain, and David considers

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.160
it strange even after a heavy thunderstorm.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.590
David then decides to head over to his neighbor’s
yard to talk about the fallen tree, and Steff

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.670
warns him to be cautious, alluring to David
and their neighbor’s past land dispute.

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.800
David meets with Norton, who’s struggling
to get his chainsaw working.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.120
David informs Norton and sees Norton’s car
had also been damaged.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.190
Norton then asks David a favor, asking him
to go to town to buy materials for repairs.

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.860
David agrees, thinking it would mend relations
with Norton.

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:02.760
Norton, David, and Billy head into town, encountering
repair vehicles on a convoy with the military.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.260
Norton recognizes them as soldiers from a
nearby military base working on Project Arrowhead.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.060
Norton asks if David knows about the project,
and David says speculations range from crashed

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.780
alien spacecraft to supernatural creatures.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:19.400
They head into the store, and David chats
with store employees Sally and Ollie, who

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.500
are busy tending to many customers.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.090
Norton thanks David, and Billy asks David
if he and Norton have reconciled.

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.320
David says it’s too early to tell, but for
the moment, they are civil.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.890
A group of soldiers enters the store, excited
to leave the town for a short vacation.

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:39.600
One of them, Jessup, shares a smile with Sally
before greeting an older woman, Mrs. Reppler.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.159
Mrs. Reppler greets Billy, asking him how
he managed the thunderstorm before rambling

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:46.470
about the storm and how it damaged a significant
portion of the town.

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.740
As Mrs. Reppler talks, David spots a woman,
Amanda, who gives him a flirty look.

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.320
Norton notices a Military Police officer entering
the store and talking to Jessup’s group.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.590
Sirens are heard from police and the fire
department speeding across town.

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.280
The Military Police officer then gives Jessup
orders to cancel their vacations and to head

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.570
back to the base as soon as possible.

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.590
Everyone in the store stops when sirens blare
from the military base.

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.620
A man with a bloodied nose, Dan, comes running
into the store, shouting that there are creatures

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.220
in the mist that took one of his friends.

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.200
Ollie tries calming him down, but he cries,
telling them to lock the store doors.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.450
One of the shoppers rushes out to get to his
car, but the mist rolls in, enveloping everything.

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.090
They only hear faint screams from the man.

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.480
Everyone stares at the store window in silence,
seeing nothing but white, when tremors rock

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.510
the store.

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.150
The store manager, Bud, tells everyone to
stay in the store, but a woman insists she

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.910
needs to get home to her kids.

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:42.450
Mrs. Carmody, a religious nut, says the fog
is death and is a sign of the apocalypse.

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.950
David later meets with Mrs. Reppler, and she
introduces him to Amanda, who is new to town.

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.020
He tends to Billy, keeping him comfortable.

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:53.140
Ollie, the store clerk, tells David he can
find blankets in the loading dock.

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.450
David heads to the loading dock and sees the
store generator had clogged.

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.650
He navigates through the darkness, and he
hears rattling coming from the store roll-up

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:00.650
doors.

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.210
The banging gets louder, and David runs back
into the store, scared.

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:07.640
He runs into Ollie and a few others who are
on their way to check the generator.

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.050
David tells them about the noise, and they
all go in to investigate.

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:18.379
Jim, one of the men, hands them flashlights,
and another store employee, Norm, joins them.

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:22.069
They discover something is clogging the generator’s
exhaust, and Norm plans on unclogging it from

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:23.099
outside.

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:26.920
David objects, saying they don’t know what’s
in the mist, but Jim and Norm want to proceed,

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.730
saying they don’t appreciate David talking
down to them just because he’s a famous

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:30.810
illustrator.

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.430
David defends himself, saying he’s only
concerned about everyone’s safety, but Jim

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.640
gets angry, threatening David.

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.490
The roll-up doors open, and Norm prepares
to head out.

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:43.620
The thick mist rolls in, and they all make
fun of David for being afraid of the mist.

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.910
Suddenly a massive tentacle materializes from
the fog and wraps around Norm’s foot before

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:48.110
pulling him out.

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:51.760
David dives in to help Norm, but the rest
of the men are frozen in fear.

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.450
More tentacles appear, and Ollie rushes to
get an ax.

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.700
The tentacles open, revealing claws and wounding
Norm, ripping chunks of his flesh out.

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.760
Ollie prepares to hack the tentacle off, but
it pulls Norm out, making Ollie miss.

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.210
Norm still manages to hold on, and David and
Ollie try to pull him back.

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:09.970
Jim and the other man are in shock, unable
to help as more tentacles wriggle in.

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.370
Ollie and David have no choice but to let
go of Norm, or else they’ll get pulled out

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:14.379
too.

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:16.700
Norm disappears into the mist, screaming.

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:20.079
Ollie rushes to close the doors while David
tries to fight off the tentacles.

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:23.160
He gets the ax and hacks away at one of the
bigger tentacles, chopping off its tip as

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.620
the door shuts.

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.340
David then punches Jim, blaming him for Norm’s
death.

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.500
Ollie separates the two men, and David continues
berating Jim for not helping.

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.410
They meet back up inside the store and plan
on how they would tell everyone.

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:37.250
David begins by telling Norton, but he doesn’t
believe them.

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:40.710
David then invites Norton to check the loading
dock to see the tentacle and Norm’s blood,

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.620
but Norton becomes hostile, thinking the group
would beat him up for payback for suing David.

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.720
The rest of the people in the store hear the
commotion, and David tells them what they

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:48.720
experienced.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.970
Unsurprisingly, nobody believes them.

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.620
David then shows them the loading dock full
of blood and the disembodied tentacle.

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.030
Bud returns to confirm to everyone that what
David said is accurate.

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:01.720
Some of the shoppers help barricade the windows,
but Norton is unconvinced, believing the scene

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.830
in the loading dock is an elaborate trick.

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:07.040
He tries convincing some of the shoppers to
leave with him while Mrs. Camody tells everyone

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.690
that what’s happening to them is foretold
in the bible, and this is the will of God.

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.759
She continues talking until she becomes the
center of the store’s attention, and she

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:15.530
resorts to scare children.

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:18.110
She then declares the mist demands a blood
sacrifice.

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:22.040
Ollie tries to neutralize the situation, threatening
Mrs. Carmody if she continues scaring the

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.040
people.

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.949
Billy overhears the soldiers discussing something,
but David takes him away.

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:30.280
Billy is scared, thinking about his mom, but
David reassures him that they’ll make it

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:31.340
back to her.

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:34.930
David meets with the rest of the people, who
are arming themselves, and some suggest making

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:35.930
torches.

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:38.919
Amanda reveals that she has a gun with her
and hands it to Ollie, who has had lots of

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:40.490
experience shooting.

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:43.530
A commotion starts when Norton and a small
group decide to head out.

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:46.770
David tries to talk them out of leaving, but
Norton believes that leaving the store would

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:50.100
be the best decision to make, thinking there's
nothing dangerous in the mist.

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:53.310
David asks one of the men to head out with
a rope tied to their waist to retrieve a shotgun

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:54.900
in one of the shopper's cars.

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:57.550
A biker volunteers and heads out with Norton's
group.

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:01.020
David mans the rope tied to the biker's waist
until it starts getting pulled.

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:04.150
It takes three men to pull back the rope,
and when they manage to pull the rope back,

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:06.780
only the biker's lower half appears.

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:10.840
Myron and Jim fix up lights, attaching them
to batteries.

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:14.520
The lights would illuminate the store in emergencies,
in case something gets into the store.

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:17.760
Later, a massive flying creature appears in
the store window.

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:21.580
Soon, more of the creatures appear, and David
realizes it's the lights that are attracting

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:22.580
them.

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:25.580
More enormous creatures then appear and start
hunting the giant insects.

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:29.730
Jim and Myron rush to turn the lights on,
unknowingly making the situation worse.

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:32.830
The shop window shatters, and the creatures
pour into the store.

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:36.130
David tries lighting a mop turning it into
a makeshift torch, trying to fend away the

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:37.130
critters.

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:40.639
Chaos ensues as more creatures get in, and
some of the people get injured and killed.

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:44.020
Fire ignites in the store, and David and the
others manage to kill several creatures by

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:48.039
lighting them on fire, and Ollie kills one
of the creatures, saving Billy.

00:06:48.039 --> 00:06:51.229
They manage to plug up the window hole, and
things calm down for a bit.

00:06:51.229 --> 00:06:54.419
One person says Mrs. Carmody’s premonition
had come true as she predicted creatures would

00:06:54.419 --> 00:06:55.910
come for them during the night.

00:06:55.910 --> 00:07:00.190
David goes around, checking on everyone, and
another man seems he had been fatally injured.

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:03.759
Amanda sees another person had drunk an entire
bottle of sleeping pills.

00:07:03.759 --> 00:07:07.509
David gathers with some of the survivors,
and they discuss the possibility of them leaving,

00:07:07.509 --> 00:07:09.600
saying how the store is not secure enough.

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:12.699
David plans on going to a pharmacy next door
to gather supplies for the injured before

00:07:12.699 --> 00:07:15.430
taking his car and driving away as far as
they could.

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:18.610
Some of the survivors agree with him, but
Amanda is afraid that the mist may cover a

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:20.389
farther distance than they think.

00:07:20.389 --> 00:07:23.889
David acknowledges this but is also concerned
about how Mrs. Carmody is slowly garnering

00:07:23.889 --> 00:07:27.470
a following with her religious rantings and
how the situation could worsen the group’s

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:28.470
paranoia.

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:31.419
Carmody keeps babbling about how the mist
demands sacrifice, and he’s scared the rest

00:07:31.419 --> 00:07:33.660
of the survivors might start believing her.

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:37.570
Amanda says everyone in the store is civilized
and would never resort to a barbaric practice,

00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:41.419
but Dan points out that scared people turn
desperate in situations like these.

00:07:41.419 --> 00:07:44.830
A few hours later, David and a group plan
to get to the pharmacy.

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:48.740
Billy cries, afraid he’ll lose his father,
but David promises to return.

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:52.050
Carmody then stands in their way, telling
them going to the pharmacy will lead the creatures

00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:53.949
back, bringing God’s wrath with them.

00:07:53.949 --> 00:07:58.270
Private Jessup joins the group, leaving his
other soldier companions back in the store.

00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:01.320
They venture into the mist and successfully
make it to the pharmacy.

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:04.770
They rummage through the aisles for supplies
and find enough medicine for the wounded.

00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:07.770
They then spot webs in the ceiling and find
people wrapped in webbed cocoons stuck to

00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:08.850
the ceiling.

00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:12.130
One of the cocooned people suddenly grabs
Jim and is revealed to be the Military Police

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:13.230
officer.

00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:15.919
He starts apologizing, saying it was their
fault.

00:08:15.919 --> 00:08:18.650
He then starts convulsing, his eyes turning
white.

00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:22.590
Jim then comes across one of the creatures,
a giant spider, and Ollie shoots, but more

00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:25.310
creatures appear and start shooting out acid
webs.

00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:28.880
One man gets his leg wrapped by the acidic
webs, and it melts his skin off.

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:32.550
The Military Police officer then drops to
the ground and bursts open, hundreds of spiders

00:08:32.550 --> 00:08:33.610
spewing out.

00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:36.649
The group is overrun, and they start retreating
to the supermarket.

00:08:36.649 --> 00:08:39.899
Unfortunately, a few members of the group
get left behind.

00:08:39.899 --> 00:08:42.300
They reach the supermarket all shouting and
scared.

00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:44.070
David runs to Billy and holds him tight.

00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:47.389
The following day, David awakens to Carmody
having a sermon with a large group of the

00:08:47.389 --> 00:08:49.139
survivors listening intently.

00:08:49.139 --> 00:08:53.160
Ollie says Carmody has become extremely convincing,
the group treating her as a prophet, believing

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:54.769
what she’s saying would come true.

00:08:54.769 --> 00:08:56.660
Jim is wholeheartedly joined in the sermon.

00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:59.140
David’s group is still decided on leaving.

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:02.970
He decides to talk to the soldiers, remembering
the Military Police officer back at the pharmacy

00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:05.449
who was apologizing and saying it was their
fault.

00:09:05.449 --> 00:09:08.040
They find Jessup and ask him what he knows
about the mist.

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:11.339
Jessup says he doesn’t know anything, and
the group notices the other two soldiers are

00:09:11.339 --> 00:09:12.339
missing.

00:09:12.339 --> 00:09:15.910
The group decides to look for the soldiers
in the loading dock, but Jim sees them.

00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:18.339
They discover that the soldiers had hung themselves.

00:09:18.339 --> 00:09:21.730
Jessup says the soldiers must have hung themselves
after he told them what the Military Police

00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:23.129
officer had said.

00:09:23.129 --> 00:09:26.819
Jim sees this and drags Jessup out to the
crowd, announcing to them he heard confirmation

00:09:26.819 --> 00:09:30.009
that the mist is the military’s fault because
of Project Arrowhead.

00:09:30.009 --> 00:09:33.559
Jessup admits he heard rumors about how the
military was experimenting with an interdimensional

00:09:33.559 --> 00:09:37.619
portal, and Carmody begins reciting how Project
Arrowhead has incurred the wrath of God, calling

00:09:37.619 --> 00:09:39.050
Jessup blasphemous.

00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:42.470
The crowd starts punching Jessup, and one
of the men starts stabbing him.

00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:45.680
Carmody then orders them to feed Jessup to
the beasts in the mist, and the crowd carries

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:47.519
him out, cheering and shouting.

00:09:47.519 --> 00:09:50.410
Jessup begs to be taken back in, but Jim locks
him out.

00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:54.700
Within seconds, a massive crab-looking creature
appears and snatches Jessup away.

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:58.399
That night, David comforts Billy, telling
Billy he will never leave him again.

00:09:58.399 --> 00:10:02.339
Billy asks David to protect him from the monsters,
and David promises he will never let the monsters

00:10:02.339 --> 00:10:03.690
get to Billy.

00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:07.240
Dawn arrives the following day, and the group
prepares to leave, but Carmody is waiting

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:08.680
for them by the door.

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:11.959
She says they are blasphemous for disobeying
her, calling them sinners.

00:10:11.959 --> 00:10:15.079
She then tells everyone that David’s group
should be sacrificed to the mist and orders

00:10:15.079 --> 00:10:17.519
her followers to take Billy as their first
sacrifice.

00:10:17.519 --> 00:10:21.369
David’s group gets swarmed, and they try
fighting back as Carmody shouts, ordering

00:10:21.369 --> 00:10:22.899
her followers to kill them.

00:10:22.899 --> 00:10:24.839
Ollie then steps out and shoots Carmody.

00:10:24.839 --> 00:10:28.839
Carmody’s followers start backing away,
allowing David’s group to leave.

00:10:28.839 --> 00:10:31.860
The group reaches the front door and starts
running through the mist to find David’s

00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:32.860
car.

00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:35.470
Ollie reaches the car first but gets snatched
by the giant crab.

00:10:35.470 --> 00:10:39.209
The rest of the group are picked out one by
one by the giant spiders and get separated.

00:10:39.209 --> 00:10:44.360
David, Billy, Mrs. Reppler, and Dan reach
the car, but the rest are less fortunate.

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:47.699
David spots Ollie’s gun and takes it before
he starts the car.

00:10:47.699 --> 00:10:51.449
They pass by the store windows with the rest
of the survivors watching them drive away.

00:10:51.449 --> 00:10:55.220
They go to David’s house, and David sees
his wife wrapped in a web cocoon.

00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:58.220
He cries but decides to continue driving for
Billy’s sake.

00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:01.260
They drive as far as they could, seeing death
and destruction everywhere.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:05.689
A humungous behemoth filled with tentacles
passes them, rocking the car with each step.

00:11:05.689 --> 00:11:09.720
They continue driving until they run out of
fuel, and the car rolls into a stop.

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:13.139
David looks around at the car’s inhabitants,
hopeless and defeated, and can tell they all

00:11:13.139 --> 00:11:14.699
have one thing in mind.

00:11:14.699 --> 00:11:18.949
He takes the gun and finds that it has four
bullets left, four bullets for five passengers.

00:11:18.949 --> 00:11:20.629
David would be the odd man out.

00:11:20.629 --> 00:11:24.100
He starts loading the weapon and fires four
times in quick succession.

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:27.029
David screams in agony before stepping out
into the mist.

00:11:27.029 --> 00:11:30.089
He shouts and stomps, wanting the creatures
in the mist to come for him.

00:11:30.089 --> 00:11:34.160
He hears rumbling, and as he prepares to meet
his demise, an armored tank appears.

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:38.110
The fog slowly lifts, and a military convoy
passes him carrying survivors and soldiers

00:11:38.110 --> 00:11:39.450
armed to the teeth.

00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:42.619
David collapses to his knees, his screams
filled with pain.

00:11:42.619 --> 00:11:46.089
The mist clears as soldiers carrying flamethrowers
and rifles are lay waste to the creatures.

00:11:46.089 --> 00:11:57.329
If only they have waited a few seconds more,
and they could have all been saved.
