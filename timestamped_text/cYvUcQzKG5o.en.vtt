Welcome back to Movie Recaps. Today I will&nbsp;
show you an adventure, comedy, family film&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:09.920
from 2013, titled Jack the Giant Slayer.
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.680
Once upon a time a little boy named Jack lived&nbsp;
with his father. The boy enjoyed reading the tale&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.000
of the giants, which his mother used to tell&nbsp;
him before she died. The story is as follows:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.320
A long time ago, the monks found magic beans&nbsp;
which they hoped would grow a pathway to god.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.080
Unfortunately, when they came up the stalk they&nbsp;
found something else standing between heaven and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.200
Earth. The place was Gantua, the home of the&nbsp;
fierce giants. The giants came down to Earth,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.280
stealing and pillaging the human race, but&nbsp;
also acquiring a taste for human flesh.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.760
The same story is quite enjoyed by Isabelle&nbsp;
as well, the little princess. Her mother reads&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.000
it to her and asks if she's not afraid from the&nbsp;
giant's leader with two heads? The girls says no,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.880
so the mother continues. The monks had returned&nbsp;
to the dark arts to find a way to rule the giants.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.120
They crafted a crown from their melted hearts.&nbsp;
King Eric enslaved the giants with the crown&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.280
and sent them back to Gantua, making it their&nbsp;
prison. He severed the stalk and peace returned&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.040
to his land. There are relics that remain from&nbsp;
that time that were buried with the king and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:08.480
story became a legend. As Jack's father tucks him&nbsp;
in bed, the boy asks if the giants will return.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:13.120
He tells him that the king's guardians, born of&nbsp;
noble blood, will cut them down. The father tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:18.000
him that the giants aren't real. Isabelle's mother&nbsp;
tells the girl that king Eric was real in a way.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.920
She's of his blood. When the girl says&nbsp;
that she's seen his grave in the catacombs,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.720
her mother realizes that she's been roaming around&nbsp;
the castle. But, she's not upset because she wants&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.240
her to know about the world, if she is to become&nbsp;
queen one day and has the power to make the world&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.800
a better place. Once, Jack's father leaves his&nbsp;
room the boy continues to read the story, that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.400
says that the giants will return to wage a war&nbsp;
with the Earth and kill the last of Eric's kin.&nbsp;

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.400
10 years later, Jack's uncle sends&nbsp;
him off to sell the horse in the city,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.920
telling him not to get distracted. Once in town,&nbsp;
Jack, now fully grown, tries to sell his horse and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.960
cart. He immediately gets distracted by the town&nbsp;
theatre. They retell the story of King Eric and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.600
the giants. Jack sees a beautiful girl in the&nbsp;
audience and she notices him staring at her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.840
Before the play ends, three men begin to harass&nbsp;
the girl, so Jack decides to step in when they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.040
follow her out. He gets punched in the face, then&nbsp;
pleads with the men to let the girl go. Suddenly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.440
a royal guardian appears behind him. The men&nbsp;
apologize to the guardian because they don't want&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.440
trouble and when they see princess Isabelle climb&nbsp;
on one of the horses, they drop to their knees,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.600
to the bewilderment of Jack. He turns around&nbsp;
and the guardian tells him to kneel as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.440
Outside of the theatre he realizes&nbsp;
that someone had stolen his cart.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.120
Meanwhile, Roderick and Wicke talk about&nbsp;
his future marriage with the princess.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.160
They run into a monk and let him pass. Once they&nbsp;
get inside the room where the relics are kept,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.160
Roderick quickly goes to check if they're in&nbsp;
their place. The magic beans have been stolen,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.400
but King Eric's crown remains there. He orders&nbsp;
Wicke to close the gates of the city and find the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.120
monk. The monk realizes that they are searching&nbsp;
for him, when Jack shows up selling his horse.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.040
He offers the boy 10 coppers for the horse and&nbsp;
Jack would gladly agree if the monk had the money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.920
with him. Because of that, the monk offers him&nbsp;
the beans as collateral. Jack isn't impressed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.600
so he tells him that they are holy relics, which&nbsp;
he could return to the abbey and exchange them for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.840
the money promised to him. The monk tells him&nbsp;
not to lose the beans or get them wet. While&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.160
Jack is still considering the offer, the monk has&nbsp;
already taken the horse and is leaving the city.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.360
Before he can escape, Wicke sends his men on&nbsp;
him. They chase him down and grab him. Later,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.760
Isabelle gets back to the castle, apologizing&nbsp;
to Elmont, her guardian, for making his job so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.800
hard. Simultaneously, Jack's uncle is scolding&nbsp;
him for exchanging the horse for the beans.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.440
He tells him that he has to grow up, because he's&nbsp;
18 years old. The king scolds the princess at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.880
same time about running away form the palace&nbsp;
without the guardians, because she's the future&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.120
queen. She asks why he would ask her to marry&nbsp;
someone twice her age and who she doesn't love,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.520
like Roderick. Isabelle tells her father that&nbsp;
she's not a fragile and helpless creature and he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:42.000
tells her she's like her mother. Jack's uncle is&nbsp;
mad and he flings the beans of the table, saying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.920
he'll have to sell the remaining possessions&nbsp;
of Jack's parents. He begs him no to do that,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.160
but the man doesn't let go. Isabelle begs her&nbsp;
father to let her be free to roam the kingdom,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.000
but he tells her that he doesn't want to lose her&nbsp;
like her mother. Even though she makes her case in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.160
front of the king, he sets his final word that&nbsp;
she will marry Roderick and stay in the palace.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:03.600
Isabelle leaves disappointed, but, that night she&nbsp;
defies her father again. Simultaneously, Wicke&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.600
and Roderick are interrogating the monk. He says&nbsp;
that they should've left the beans where they were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:12.960
buried, because they were made from dark magic.&nbsp;
The beans can't be controlled. Roderick kills him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:17.840
Later, Jack is worried about his uncle being out&nbsp;
in the storm. In the same time, the princess is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.240
lost when she sees the lights on Jack's house and&nbsp;
follows them. As Jack is getting ready to go out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.640
and look for his uncle, the princess knocks on&nbsp;
his door. He invites her inside and they chat,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:31.600
as the ground below the house fills with water,&nbsp;
getting closer to a magic bean. Jack and Isabelle&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.920
talk about books and adventures. He tells her that&nbsp;
he got into a fight in the princess's honor at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:40.400
market, both pretending that they don't recognize&nbsp;
each other. Jack asks her what she's running away&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.640
from. She says that she's just looking for an&nbsp;
adventure and Jack kneels, making it known that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:49.520
he's aware of who she is. Isabelle tells him to&nbsp;
stand, then thanks him for defending her honor.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.840
The bean begins the sprout under the house, but&nbsp;
to two of them are still unaware. He gives her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.840
his favorite book about the giants and tells her&nbsp;
that he hopes she'll find what she's looking for.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.360
Suddenly, the house begins to shake&nbsp;
and a giant stem rips the floors open,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:06.400
as it rises to the sky. Jack is thrown outside&nbsp;
and Isabelle is trapped into the farmhouse.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.840
It gets picked up by the rising beanstalk&nbsp;
and Jack jumps to it so he can help Isabelle.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.840
The house keeps getting elevated higher and&nbsp;
higher, when Jack finally gets back to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:19.200
house and tries to come inside. Isabelle opens the&nbsp;
door, nearly pushing him off. He grabs her hand,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:22.640
but still falls down the beanstalk,&nbsp;
taking her mother's bracelet with him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:26.240
Jack manages to arrive safely back down&nbsp;
at the foot of the stalk, but passes out.&nbsp;

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:31.120
The following morning, the king wakes him up&nbsp;
and asks him why he has his daughter's bracelet.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.120
Jack gets recognized by Elmont from the market&nbsp;
and is allowed to explain what happened.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:39.680
Both him and Roderick will help the guardians find&nbsp;
and rescue Isabelle. Later, the men are making&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:44.880
their way up the stalk. Roderick is clearly up to&nbsp;
something. Jack asks Elmont what he thinks is up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:48.960
there, but the guardian doesn't believe in giants.&nbsp;
He tells the boy that he shouldn't be doing this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.480
to impress the princess, because even if she&nbsp;
didn't marry Roderick, she could never marry&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:57.040
a commoner like him. Crawe, the other guardian,&nbsp;
helps Jack get to the other side of the stalk,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:01.440
but the boy unfortunately falls. They save&nbsp;
him and keep climbing the massive beanstalk,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:05.440
loosing people on the way at the behest of&nbsp;
Roderick and unbeknownst to Elmont. Only 6 of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:10.400
them remain. The next day, they awake to realize&nbsp;
that they have reached to top of the beanstalk.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:14.400
Since the princess isn't in Jack's house, they&nbsp;
enter the world of the giants searching for her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:18.640
As the guardians begin the pursuit, Roderick stops&nbsp;
Jack and threatens him for the rest of the magic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:23.280
beans. He gives them the purse and is threatened&nbsp;
not to say a word. Jack keeps one of the beans&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:28.240
and puts it in his locket. Elmont and Crawe find a&nbsp;
clue that Isabelle has left to find her way back.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:32.240
Crawe and the others follow Isabelle's marks, when&nbsp;
suddenly Jack finds the book that he gave her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:35.840
saying to the rest that she must've hidden&nbsp;
there. They see some broken branches and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:40.160
Jack supposes that something big pulled her out of&nbsp;
her hiding place and that she must be in trouble.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:45.280
Elmont orders the men to split up in two groups.&nbsp;
Him, Crawe and Jack find some sheep and try&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:49.360
to catch one, when they set off a trap. Elmont&nbsp;
begins to cut them out when he notices something&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:54.480
approaching. Once they are out, they hide from&nbsp;
that which approaches - a giant. It eats a sheep&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:59.120
whole, then catches Crawe's sent and finds him.&nbsp;
The man runs, but the giant gets to him in a few&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:03.680
leaps. As it's getting prepared to eat Crawe,&nbsp;
Elmont runs up to him and stabs him, just to get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:09.360
knocked out. The giant grabs them both and takes&nbsp;
them away. Jack follows it. Meanwhile, the other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:13.360
group gets to a waterfall, so the guardian tells&nbsp;
Roderick to sit and rest while he finds another&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:19.120
way around. They trick him and push him off the&nbsp;
cliff. Suddenly, a giant grabs Wicke and eats him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:23.120
Another giant appears, but Roderick gets to&nbsp;
the crown in time and manages to save himself.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:28.400
Jack has followed the giant into one of their&nbsp;
cities. Simultaneously, Isabelle is being kept&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:33.440
prisoner by a giant, who questions her about how&nbsp;
she got there. She won't answer. When it asks her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:38.160
about others coming for her, she says that she's&nbsp;
alone. But the two headed giant - General Fallon&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:42.720
knows that Isabelle is a descendant from king&nbsp;
Eric. He shows her around to his men, saying that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:47.600
the humans have returned. Suddenly, the other&nbsp;
giant brings Crawe and Elmont there as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:52.480
The leader of the giants questions the two of them&nbsp;
and when Crawe antagonizes him, it eats him. Jack&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:56.960
follows the commotion in the giant city, but has&nbsp;
to hide from two giants before he gets there. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:00.800
general threatens Elmont that he'll eat Isabelle&nbsp;
if he doesn't answer his questions and argues&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:04.960
with another giant over the right to do that, when&nbsp;
Roderick suddenly shows up wearing the crown. All&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:09.840
the giants kneel to him, even the general. Elmont&nbsp;
is happy when he shows up, but Roderick just takes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:14.400
the throne. To both his and Isabelle's surprise,&nbsp;
Roderick orders the giants to fight for him as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:19.520
their king and take over the Earth as his army. He&nbsp;
tells them to prepare for battle at dawn. General&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:24.400
Fallon doesn't like that. Meanwhile, Jack finds&nbsp;
the room with all the loot the giants have stolen.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:28.720
Then takes a look at the city and hears Isabelle&nbsp;
beg for her life as she's being taken away.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:32.960
Her and Elmont are being prepared to be eaten.&nbsp;
Jack arrives to save them while the giant cook&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:38.080
looks for something. He can't get Isabelle out,&nbsp;
so he goes over to Elmont and gives him a knife.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:42.160
The giant comes back, almost killing Elmont&nbsp;
with a giant pick, then puts him in the oven.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:46.560
Before he gets cooked, Jack climbs over to get&nbsp;
him, while he lets himself out of the dough.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:51.280
Suddenly, the giant pulls Isabelle out of the&nbsp;
cage and gets ready to chop her up, when Jack&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:55.840
takes one of the cooking knives and stabs him with&nbsp;
it. Elmont releases himself and Isabelle hides,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:55.840 --> 00:09:00.720
as Jack remains dangling on the giant's back. It&nbsp;
hits itself in the wall, effectively finishing the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:05.760
job. Elmont is impressed that Jack killed a giant,&nbsp;
then Jack tells them that he knows a way out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:09.520
Meanwhile, at the foot of the stalk, the king&nbsp;
asks one of his generals if they should cut the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:13.760
beanstalk down. The man says that the stalk is&nbsp;
a means to get up, but one to get down as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:19.280
They speculate on what might come down from there.&nbsp;
Back at Gantua, Roderick orders one of the giants&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:23.840
to wait for the rest at the edge. Jack sanitizes&nbsp;
Isabell's wound, while Elmont laments over the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:28.640
death of his friend. She feels guilty for running&nbsp;
away and causing this to happen. Jack tells her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:33.200
that on the other hand, if she didn't, Roderick&nbsp;
would have taken over the kingdom with no warning.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:36.480
He tells her that they need to get her back&nbsp;
so that when she becomes the queen, she could&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:41.440
make the world a better place. Her bleeding stops&nbsp;
and Elmont asks where they should go. They follow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:45.600
the river to the edge, where they find the giant&nbsp;
sleeping. Jack thinks that they should wake him up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:50.320
with the help of a beehive. The two men approach&nbsp;
the sleeping giant and place the hive in his mask,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:55.200
then run back to hide. They wait for a moment,&nbsp;
then the giant wakes, stumbles over himself&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:55.200 --> 00:10:00.640
and then falls over the cliff. Isabelle and Jack&nbsp;
hug, but Elmont disapproves. As they walk toward&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:05.360
the edge, Elmont tells them that he needs to stay&nbsp;
behind and take care of Roderick. He tells Jack to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:09.840
bring the princess home and makes him a guardian.&nbsp;
Isabelle says goodbye to him and the two leave.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:14.560
At the foot of the stalk, the giant falls down.&nbsp;
The king sees him, then orders his general to cut&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:18.640
the beanstalk down for the sake of the kingdom.&nbsp;
The general is reluctant because the princess&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:22.720
still hasn't arrived, so the king takes his sword&nbsp;
and goes over to cut it, asking his daughter for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:27.040
forgiveness. When he sees the king's resolve,&nbsp;
the general orders his men to cut the stalk.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:32.560
Simultaneously, Jack and Isabelle climb down the&nbsp;
stalk and see their city at its foot. They kiss,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:36.720
then wonder what the people down the stalk are&nbsp;
doing. The operation to cut down the beanstalk is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:42.240
seriously underway. Meanwhile at Gantua, Elmont&nbsp;
waits for Roderick at the edge. He's woken up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:46.720
by the approaching giant army. Roderick arrives&nbsp;
and goes over to the edge, when suddenly Elmont&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:50.960
attacks him and he drops the rest of the beans.&nbsp;
They fall inside the entrance cave and struggle.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:56.080
Roderick asks for the giants to help so general&nbsp;
Fallon tells his men to dig him out. Roderick and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:56.080 --> 00:11:00.080
Elmont fight and Roderick has the upper hand, when&nbsp;
Elmont manages to grab his sword and wound him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:04.720
But, Roderick pushes him almost off the edge&nbsp;
again and Elmont grabs his knife and stabs him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:09.760
The giants dig a hole through the stone, but don't&nbsp;
manage to get to Roderick in time before he dies.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:14.160
What they do manage to do is take the crown.&nbsp;
General Fallon puts it on as a ring and becomes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:18.080
the king of the giants. Back at the foot of&nbsp;
the stalk, the men have succeeded in cutting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:23.040
one part of it. When it begins to shake and tear&nbsp;
apart, Isabelle and Jack can feel it higher up.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:27.600
The sheer mass of the stalk begins to come down on&nbsp;
the men in its foot. Jack tells Isabelle to hang&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:32.480
on. Elmont jumps on the top of the stalk before it&nbsp;
collapses completely and general Fallon watches it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:37.840
go. Jack and Isabelle ride the stalk and he uses&nbsp;
one of it's stems as a rope to swing away from it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:41.840
The rest of the stalk that Elmont is riding, gets&nbsp;
almost to the palace and destroys a part of it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:45.760
but not before he can jump off as well. The&nbsp;
king feels horrible because he thinks that he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:50.560
has lost his daughter. Suddenly, his general&nbsp;
approaches and brings her to him. Isabelle&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:54.880
tells him about Roderick and he says he's sorry.&nbsp;
Jack leaves and when Isabelle asks about him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:54.880 --> 00:12:00.000
the king goes after him. He rewards Jack, saying&nbsp;
that as a father he can't reward him enough.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.240
Isabelle comes out wearing an armor and as they&nbsp;
say goodbye he gives her the book to remember him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:08.480
She rides with her father to the palace.&nbsp;
Simultaneously, general Fallon finds the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:12.080
rest of the magic beans. He throws them&nbsp;
in the water and they instantly sprout.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:16.880
General Fallon gets his men prepared as the beans&nbsp;
begin to grow on the very edge of their land.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:21.280
The giants begin to climb and push the stalks&nbsp;
down even before they are fully formed. General&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:26.480
Fallon jumps on as well. On Earth, Jack finds his&nbsp;
horse and sees the giants coming down, then rides&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:31.840
to inform the king. Moments later, the giants&nbsp;
arrive. Jack tells a monk to ring the alarm and as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:36.400
he approaches the king and Isabelle, telling them&nbsp;
about the giants, they see the giants behind him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:40.560
Everyone hurries back toward the city, with the&nbsp;
giants catching up and killing the king's men.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:44.720
General Fallon goes after the king, but&nbsp;
they are slowed down by the first beanstalk.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:49.280
Elmont gets the army in the city ready - from the&nbsp;
archers to the hot oil. The giants are right on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:53.920
Jack's tail, as Elmont waits for them to arrive in&nbsp;
the city to light up the oil. The king enters the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:59.360
city and he rises the drawbridge before Jack gets&nbsp;
on it. He jumps on, but so does General Fallon.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:03.760
Elmont pushes him off the bridge and he burns in&nbsp;
the oil. The other giants prepare to get into the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:09.200
city, but Fallon survives under the water. Elmont&nbsp;
reunites with Jack and Isabelle. He tells the king&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:12.960
that the giants have the crown and they suddenly&nbsp;
throw a bell into the city, then latch onto the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:17.200
drawbridge with hooks. The king tells Isabelle to&nbsp;
go to his chambers and light a beacon to warn the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:22.720
other kingdoms. He tells Jack to look after her.&nbsp;
Elmont and the rest manage to hold the drawbridge.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:27.200
Isabelle leads Jack through a shortcut via the&nbsp;
royal catacombs and they pass king Eric's grave.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:31.200
They get to the royal chamber, when they hear&nbsp;
something under to floor. General Fallon pushes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:35.600
through it and they run. The army keeps trying to&nbsp;
hold the giants off, but they just keep decimating&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:40.160
their ranks. They throw enflamed threes into&nbsp;
the city. The humans fire at the giants with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:43.760
spears and finally make some progress in&nbsp;
the fight, but the giants just fight back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:49.120
and destroy their weapons. Fallon can smell the&nbsp;
princess, as her and Jack hide in the king's robe.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:53.360
He finds them and they run away going up a tight&nbsp;
staircase. Fallon breaks through a wall to get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:57.760
to them and grabs Isabelle, then grabs Jack as&nbsp;
well when he tries to kill him. As the giant&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:02.160
is about to swallow Jack whole, he takes out the&nbsp;
remaining magic bean and throws it in his mouth.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:06.720
The bean begins to sprout in his stomach and comes&nbsp;
out of him, killing him and destroying the palace.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:10.720
As pieces of the giant fall around Jack and&nbsp;
Isabelle, his hand with the crown falls next to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:15.520
Jack. Meanwhile, the rest of the giants pull the&nbsp;
drawbridge back down, so the humans shut the doors&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:19.360
to the city. The men get ready for the arrival&nbsp;
of the giants and wait as they break through.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.160
Suddenly, they see the beanstalk taking apart the&nbsp;
palace and the giants drop their weapons, then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:28.400
kneel in front of the human army. Jack appears&nbsp;
wearing the crown and Isabelle takes his hand.&nbsp;

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:31.920
Much later, Jack is reading the&nbsp;
ending of the story to his children,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:35.920
where the giants were made to get back on their&nbsp;
land and the princess wed her farm boy prince.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:39.840
The kids ask about the crown, worried that the&nbsp;
giants will come back, but he tells them that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:44.400
it's in a safe place as Isabelle joins them.&nbsp;
Jack tells them the story of the giants again,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:48.240
as the reconstruction of the crown is seen,&nbsp;
becoming what the Imperial State Crown looks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:52.720
like today. The crown is seen in present&nbsp;
day, as a guide tells some students about it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:55.600
The safe place in which it is held&nbsp;
is in Westminster Abbey in London.
