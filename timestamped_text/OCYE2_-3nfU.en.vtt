00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.770
Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.100
Today I'm going to explain a Mexican horror
film called The Day of The Lord.

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.370
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:10.060
Watch out and take care Menendez is a retired
priest.

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:13.710
After performing an exorcism on a boy who
died in his hands, he was imprisoned.

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.789
Upon his release, numerous security measures
are observed.

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:19.490
He is in a police vehicle shackled in chains
and handcuffs.

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.080
Additionally, two officers also guard him.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.870
They are on the way to his new home.

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:25.960
He dreams of Marisa, the mother of the boy
who died.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.770
In his dream, Marisa is on top of him and
gently gives him a kiss.

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:32.369
She gets up and asks Menendez to bless her
with a child.

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.720
The speech sounds like seduction at first,
but Marisa’s tone changes.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.460
She adds that he caused her son’s death
and that he brought her little boy to hell.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.850
Menendez sees the lifeless body of the boy,
all bloody and beaten.

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.670
He wakes up while breathing shakily after
the terrible dream.

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.990
He gets up and immediately drinks a bottle
of whiskey by his bedside table.

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:50.860
Menendez now lives in a tumbledown house in
seclusion.

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.739
He struggles daily to hold on to the last
remnants of his faith.

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:56.579
He receives a call on his telephone from a
mysterious caller.

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.110
But he has a conversation as if they know
each other well.

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.809
He tells the caller that he is fine and starting
a new life.

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:05.180
All of a sudden, Menendez gets angry about
something, but promises the caller that he

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:06.720
will hear from him again.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.360
He enters a room and opens a box of old newspapers.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.000
He sees an article about him being found guilty
of killing the boy.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.960
It upsets him very much so he closes the box.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.590
Before putting the phone down, Menendez promises
the caller that he gave up drinking.

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.210
He enters the kitchen to pour the bottle of
liquor into the sink.

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.299
However, after doing so, he regrets his decision
and starts scouring the kitchen for a filled

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:26.299
bottle.

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:27.840
He finally finds one in a lower compartment.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.530
After finding it, he embraces the bottle in
happiness and relief.

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.259
Recently, he relies his sanity solely on liquor.

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:36.119
That same day, he hears a heavy knock from
his front door.

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.440
A man outside commands him to open the door.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.150
Menendez thinks it through as he is not ready
to be in contact with anyone just yet.

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.970
After some convincing, he finally opens the
door for his friend, Sebas, whom he met in

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:46.970
prison.

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.869
They hug each other after not being able to
see one another for a significant amount of

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:50.990
time.

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.409
Sebas checks out the new place, and says that
he likes it because it is spacious.

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:57.399
He shows Menendez a bottle of liquor that
he plans on sharing with him to celebrate

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:58.659
their reunion.

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:02.049
On the table, Menendez refuses to have any,
because he abstains from alcohol in order

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:04.220
to fix his crippling mental state.

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.979
Sebas persuades him to have a shot, and even
call him “Father”.

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:10.029
Menendez tells him that he should not refer
to him with that name, because he has left

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:11.549
the clergy after the tragic exorcism.

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:16.209
Sebas used to be an addict, but Menendez helped
him back then to get his life back on track.

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:19.319
He breaks down in front of him, so Menendez
asks him what is wrong.

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.300
His manner changes completely.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.090
Sebas desperately begs for the former priest’s
help after revealing that his daughter, Raquel,

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.689
is possessed by a demon.

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:31.090
Menendez is taken aback because the topic
triggers him very much.

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.859
Sebas claims that he has gone to everyone
else,

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:36.189
from physicians to therapists, but no one
has been able to help his daughter.

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:39.709
Menendez reminds Sebas that his methods are
very particular and might harm his daughter.

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:42.900
Knowing that the process could get violent,
he asks Sebas if he is truly willing to go

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:43.900
through it.

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.980
He responds by saying that he would rather
see Raquel die and go to heaven with the Lord

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.989
than for her to be alive with the demon.

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:52.639
According to Menendez, Raquel may be going
through a bad phase, or have bad influences

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:54.969
in her life, causing her to act strangely.

00:02:54.969 --> 00:02:57.319
But Sebas is convinced that she is possessed.

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:01.089
One reason is because a cat that was once
inseparable with Raquel disappeared one day.

00:03:01.089 --> 00:03:03.010
He found it buried headless in their garden.

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.049
A few days after that, he found the cat’s
head under Raquel’s bed, in a shoe box.

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:09.010
He has no doubts that his daughter did it.

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.579
He describes seeing sinister- looking eyes
in her daughter.

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:14.939
Menendez takes the shot of alcohol and agrees
to exorcise Raquel.

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:18.280
Menendez opens his laptop to search for graphic
content on the internet.

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.299
He contemplates on this, and decides to avoid
temptation.

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:25.159
Moments later, his doorbell rings; Marisa
visits him on a regular basis to check up

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:26.589
on him and the place.

00:03:26.589 --> 00:03:29.269
She offers to clean and do chores for him
free of charge.

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:33.309
Menendez says that it is unnecessary for her
to keep coming and help with daily tasks.

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:36.389
Marisa tells him that it pains her to see
the former priest lock himself in the house

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:38.650
and have lesser will to live as days go by.

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.359
The more they talk, the more they get intimate
with each other.

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:45.269
Marisa realizes that what they are doing is
wrong, so she walks away to leave.

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:48.260
Before she exits, she tells him to move to
the guest house so he can have clean clothes

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:49.260
and warm food.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.909
Left alone, Menendez takes a deep breath as
the telephone rings again.

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:56.129
He admits to the caller that he has not given
up alcohol and that he lied when he said he

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:57.129
did.

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:00.019
Menendez tells the caller that he knows it
is him that sends Marisa to the house every

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:01.019
week.

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:04.040
Also, he apologizes to the caller for not
inviting him to the house.

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.150
The identity of the caller is unclear, but
it seems that he knows a lot about the former

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:08.150
priest.

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.430
Menendez’s bedroom is filled with crosses.

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.839
He is still plagued by nightmares about the
incident.

00:04:12.839 --> 00:04:14.999
He dreams of Marisa entering his room.

00:04:14.999 --> 00:04:18.109
She is holding scissors and looks like she
is planning to do something brutal.

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:20.169
She climbs to the bed to cut off his private
parts.

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:23.580
As he screams in pain, the figurines disfigure
and scream as well.

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.220
Menendez wakes up with a frightened and disturbed
mood.

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.380
He goes to the bathroom to fix his appearance.

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.669
A sense of urgency to change makes him get
up to clean the entire place.

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:33.930
He also prepares the house for Raquel’s
visit.

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.520
Despite the time of not being an active servant
of the charge, he still remembers the preparation

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.159
for routines and rituals.

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:42.770
He sprinkles holy water around the house,
and prays the rosary in his makeshift chapel.

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.610
For the first time since his release, he gets
out of the house to throw the trash.

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:49.479
He hurriedly runs back inside before anyone
could see him.

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:52.669
After grabbing the bottle of whiskey for him
to throw away, he notices another newspaper

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:54.129
with him as the headline.

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:56.720
It makes him recall memories of seeing Marisa’s
son.

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.580
From that time, his faith was
shaken and gradually lost.

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.789
Menendez is hopeful that saving Raquel will
bring him redemption for his failure with

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:03.919
Marisa’s son.

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:06.860
A couple of minutes later, someone knocks
on his door.

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.470
Sebas arrives with his daughter who he claims
to be possessed.

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:12.990
Raquel immediately gives Menendez a very menacing
look while she listens to heavy metal on her

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:14.250
headphones.

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.490
Sebas introduces them to each other awkwardly.

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.800
Raquel enters the house and observes the place.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.599
She does not seem to have any emotions or
reaction toward staying there for days.

00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:26.009
While she walks around, Menendez apologizes
to Sebas for making them come all the way

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:27.400
there and wasting their time.

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.370
Apparently, he is not ready to perform an
exorcism just yet.

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:33.699
This annoys Sebas because he thought that
they already had a concise agreement.

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:37.120
They get into an argument, and Menendez claims
that he only agreed yesterday because he was

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.280
drunk.

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.000
Sebas takes out a knife and points it to his
neck.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.879
He tells the former priest that he will end
his life on the spot if he does not help him

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:43.879
cure his daughter.

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:46.969
Menendez stops him and says that the things
he will have to do to free Raquel will destroy

00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:49.629
him forever, just as what happened to Marisa’s
son.

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:52.729
Raquel stares at them blankly, so they both
get up and arrive on the decision to forego

00:05:52.729 --> 00:05:54.389
the exorcism.

00:05:54.389 --> 00:05:58.120
Sebas tries to embrace Raquel before leaving,
but she refuses to be touched.

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:01.340
After he leaves, Menendez tries to talk to
Raquel about how her father loves her very

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:02.340
much.

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:04.919
She replies that her father is completely
out of his mind.

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:07.860
Menendez gives Raquel a quick tour of the
house, and shows her the room she will be

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:09.370
staying at.

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:13.819
He leaves her alone, but before that, he sees
Raquel looking at the crucifix.

00:06:13.819 --> 00:06:17.690
She puts her belongings down to sit by the
bed, and finds a bible inside the drawer.

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:21.099
She calls one of her friends to plot her escape
from the house; a sound from the closet catches

00:06:21.099 --> 00:06:22.939
her attention so she opens it.

00:06:22.939 --> 00:06:25.680
She finds someone watching her from a tiny
hole, so she screams.

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:28.789
Menendez comes to her room to comfort her,
but she storms out.

00:06:28.789 --> 00:06:31.190
He notices that the crucifix has been inverted.

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:34.490
She finds that this is the perfect time for
her to flee, but the door is locked.

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:37.740
She commands Menendez to unlock the door right
away, but just shows her the keys tied to

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:38.740
his neck.

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:41.300
She frantically tells him that if he doesn’t
hand her over the keys, she will shout that

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:42.610
he is harassing her.

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:46.360
Menendez calmly says that it is no use to
do that because he does not have neighbors.

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:50.150
Out of frustration, Raquel brings out her
taser, but she is holding it backwards, causing

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:51.699
her to receive the shock.

00:06:51.699 --> 00:06:55.249
She falls unconscious, so Menendez drags her
all the way to the couch.

00:06:55.249 --> 00:06:58.190
As he lays her down, he removes her jacket
and her top.

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:01.400
In a very disturbing manner, Menendez sniffs
it while she is asleep.

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:05.000
Eventually, Raquel wakes up and notices that
she isn’t wearing her jacket anymore and

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.349
that her top slightly shows part of her shoulder.

00:07:07.349 --> 00:07:10.189
She adjusts her clothing just as Menendez
hands her a cup of tea.

00:07:10.189 --> 00:07:13.729
Now that she is calm and relaxed, Menendez
explains to her that the exorcism is for her

00:07:13.729 --> 00:07:15.120
own good.

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:18.100
Sebas loves her very much, that is why he
is leaving her in his care.

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:19.990
The priest lights up incense in one corner
of the room

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:21.490
as part of the process.

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:24.930
All of a sudden, Menendez strangles her mercilessly
while saying that he won’t stop until he

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:26.529
takes the devil out of her.

00:07:26.529 --> 00:07:29.120
She wakes up and realizes that it is just
a dream.

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:32.379
At this point, she is now ready to have a
proper conversation with him.

00:07:32.379 --> 00:07:35.479
Menendez admits to spying on her from the
closet because he overheard her plan to sneak

00:07:35.479 --> 00:07:36.810
out with her friends.

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:39.379
Raquel tries to persuade him that her father
is the crazy one.

00:07:39.379 --> 00:07:42.889
According to her, she goes out a lot and acts
weird simply because she is a teenager.

00:07:42.889 --> 00:07:46.069
While explaining this, she gets more agitated
and says obscure words out loud.

00:07:46.069 --> 00:07:48.800
Menendez kneels in front of her to go into
a praying position.

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:51.580
The act confuses and silences Raquel, and
she starts to calm down.

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:55.069
They continue the consultation; Raquel shares
that she has a dancing group with her friends

00:07:55.069 --> 00:07:57.349
and they have hopes of being in a talent show
on TV.

00:07:57.349 --> 00:08:00.830
She gets excited once she starts talking about
her passion in dancing, and even offers to

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:01.940
dance for Menendez.

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:05.469
However, her mood suddenly changes and she
calls him a dirty old man when he seems to

00:08:05.469 --> 00:08:06.639
like the idea.

00:08:06.639 --> 00:08:10.169
She confronts the priest about her being undressed
by him; his eyes widen, and she just laughs

00:08:10.169 --> 00:08:11.740
at him for seeming guilty.

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:14.180
Raquel gets up and goes to the bathroom to
smoke.

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:17.409
She sees the toilet paper covered in text,
but uses it anyway.

00:08:17.409 --> 00:08:21.360
She pees while smoking, then all of a sudden,
the door knob moves uncontrollably.

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:24.120
She thinks that it is Menendez, so she shouts
at him.

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:26.849
Menendez answers from a distance saying that
it was not him.

00:08:26.849 --> 00:08:30.479
Raquel talks to herself and admits that her
father may be right about her being crazy.

00:08:30.479 --> 00:08:32.839
She tries to flush the toilet, but it is stuck.

00:08:32.839 --> 00:08:34.349
She goes out to look for Menendez.

00:08:34.349 --> 00:08:36.820
He frightens her as he is standing right by
her side.

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:40.409
He explains that one of the beams is loose,
and he will fix it right away.

00:08:40.409 --> 00:08:43.430
Menendez acts very weird, given that Raquel
is a young woman.

00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:46.300
That night, Menendez cooks meat and vegetables
for Raquel.

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:49.500
He initiates a conversation about the cat
that her father saw headless.

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:53.360
She denies the accusation and tells him that
he should not believe her father at all times.

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.160
She firmly believes that she is not possessed.

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:58.399
Menendez says that he knows Raquel can feel
the entity inside her, but she is clueless

00:08:58.399 --> 00:08:59.399
about his remarks.

00:08:59.399 --> 00:09:01.910
She does not feel anything contrary to what
they keep telling her.

00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:05.560
The strength and inertia to disregard everything
and question everything makes it evident.

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:08.079
However, Raquel tells him not to lecture her.

00:09:08.079 --> 00:09:11.389
To lighten the mood, she asks him about his
relationships in the past.

00:09:11.389 --> 00:09:14.810
He replies that he met a girl once and fell
in love, but their relationship was different

00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:15.810
and abrupt.

00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:19.240
Menendez tries to break her walls by persuading
her to open up about her past relationships

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:20.339
as well.

00:09:20.339 --> 00:09:24.130
She is hesitant at first, but she eventually
tells a story about dating an older man named

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:25.130
Javi.

00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:28.079
He invited her to a party, but Javi and his
friends just made fun of her.

00:09:28.079 --> 00:09:29.959
She cries in the priest’s arms.

00:09:29.959 --> 00:09:33.230
After crying, her mood completely changes
and she tells Menendez that she will dance

00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:34.230
for him.

00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:36.960
Back in the living room, Raquel lets Menendez
wear her headphones.

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:39.690
She moves some of the furniture so she can
move more freely.

00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:41.620
She starts to dance to upbeat music.

00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:44.209
The face of Menendez is both puzzled and amazed.

00:09:44.209 --> 00:09:48.270
As her movements become more extreme, he walks
out after saying that it is time for bed.

00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:50.949
Raquel is now in her room preparing to go
to sleep.

00:09:50.949 --> 00:09:53.329
Suddenly, she hears a knock from Menendez.

00:09:53.329 --> 00:09:55.850
Raquel tries seduction to see if Menendez
is true to his faith.

00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:59.579
It ends when Menendez knocks her out, takes
her to the basement and ties her up.

00:09:59.579 --> 00:10:02.570
Raquel gains consciousness and gets a sight
of Menendez smoking.

00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:06.019
The clock hits midnight, it is now Sunday—
the day of the Lord which means that he will

00:10:06.019 --> 00:10:08.180
start the exorcism in a few moments.

00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:11.550
Raquel is hysterical while trying to persuade
Menendez to let her go.

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:13.910
She assures him that she won’t say a thing
to anyone.

00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:17.089
He gives no attention to her pleas and sits
in front of her instead.

00:10:17.089 --> 00:10:20.290
He brings out a long electric stick to taunt
the demon, but it is unsure if a demon is

00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:21.510
even there in the first place.

00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:23.350
He tells her that his working methods are
very rough.

00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:26.910
At this point, Raquel becomes more panic-stricken
because she has no idea how to make him believe

00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:28.320
that she is not possessed.

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:31.800
She begs him to let her go, but Menendez is
focused on talking to the demon whom he believes

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:33.430
is there, but just unresponsive.

00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:35.519
Because of fear, Raquel pees herself on the
chair.

00:10:35.519 --> 00:10:38.759
Menendez points the electric stick on the
wet surface, which electrocutes Raquel.

00:10:38.759 --> 00:10:40.759
She twitches excessively as she is in great
pain.

00:10:40.759 --> 00:10:43.740
When he begins torturing her to purge her
soul of the quiet demonic influence, Raquel

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:45.750
shrieks in great pain that her voice even
changes.

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:47.529
Now, she is a victim of terrible abuse.

00:10:47.529 --> 00:10:51.290
It leaves a deep impact on Menendez as well,
as he fears that this attempt might also result

00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:53.459
in the death of the person he is trying to
save.

00:10:53.459 --> 00:10:57.060
He goes upstairs to contact Sebas using Raquel’s
phone, asking if he could help him with the

00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:58.060
process.

00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:01.360
He also uses the telephone to talk to the
mysterious caller, who seems to be a divine

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:02.360
being.

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:04.880
He tells the caller that although the possession
is a strong one, Sebas can handle the sight

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:06.010
of his daughter being tortured.

00:11:06.010 --> 00:11:09.130
He also thanks the mysterious caller for listening
and giving him words of encouragement.

00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:12.160
As he prays and prepares himself for the exorcism,
Sebas arrives.

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:14.110
He seems very nervous about how the outcome
will be.

00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:17.670
Menendez reveals to him that he secretly conducted
experiments on her to see if she is possessed

00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:21.350
by a demon and discovered that a malevolent
being is certainly using her as a host.

00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:25.200
He used a special incense that stinks; Raquel
does not notice the smell, which is the first

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:26.200
symptom.

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:29.230
He also gave her rotten meat, and she ate
it without a problem, which is the second

00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:30.230
symptom.

00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:33.940
During her naps, she spoke in a strange language
and he saw that her body has marks with specific

00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:34.940
patterns.

00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:37.210
According to him, he has seen it with his
past subjects.

00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:41.000
Menendez shows pictures of Raquel’s body
with demonic marks to her father.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.901
Sebas questions him why he took pictures of
his daughter’s body without clothes, but

00:11:43.901 --> 00:11:46.779
he brushes away the topic by saying that they
have to check on her.

00:11:46.779 --> 00:11:50.089
Menendez seems to be the abuser at this point,
and conceals it with believing that a demon

00:11:50.089 --> 00:11:51.560
is taking over Raquel.

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:53.459
Both of them prepare to go down the basement.

00:11:53.459 --> 00:11:57.040
Menendez gives reminders to Sebas about the
things that he should and shouldn’t do.

00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:00.300
He highlights parts of the Bible that Sebas
should read during the process.

00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:02.680
According to him, reading it will drive the
demon crazy.

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:06.740
He also asked Sebas to bring a mask to cover
his identity while they perform the exorcism.

00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:08.180
They make their way to the basement.

00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:11.230
Sebas is concealed with a funny-looking mask,
so Raquel won’t recognize him.

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:13.690
While reading, he also changes his accent
so she won’t know it’s him.

00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:16.880
He reads the passages out loud while Raquel
worries about the pain that she will surely

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:17.880
undergo.

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:19.720
Menendez lays the equipment he will use on
a corner.

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:22.019
He wears a knuckle ring and approaches Raquel.

00:12:22.019 --> 00:12:25.260
She commands the demon to leave her body,
then punches her the first time.

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:28.500
He punches her another time, and wounds start
to cover her face.

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:31.579
He continues to torture her, but Sebas stops
reading.

00:12:31.579 --> 00:12:32.820
She does not seem possessed.

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:36.089
Menendez asks him to continue because if he
doesn’t, the demon will take full possession

00:12:36.089 --> 00:12:37.089
of his daughter.

00:12:37.089 --> 00:12:39.940
He even slaps him so he could focus and not
give in to her pleas.

00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:42.730
Raquel recognizes her father and calls for
him.

00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:46.069
Sebas continues to read as Menendez removes
one of Raquel’s nails.

00:12:46.069 --> 00:12:48.900
She shrieks in pain while he does the same
with the rest of her nails.

00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:50.829
Raquel’s father is now convinced to release
her.

00:12:50.829 --> 00:12:53.060
He could not stand the sight of her being
hurt any longer.

00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:56.250
Sebas knocks Menendez to the ground and apologizes
to his daughter for the pain she has been

00:12:56.250 --> 00:12:57.250
through.

00:12:57.250 --> 00:13:00.240
After embracing and letting her go, Raquel’s
eyes change to a different color.

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:03.160
At this moment, he knew he made a terrible
mistake.

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:04.930
The demon has played the victim perfectly.

00:13:04.930 --> 00:13:07.889
She moves in a monstrous manner, and pushes
Sebas across the room.

00:13:07.889 --> 00:13:11.319
Raquel’s possessed body is able to drag
the body of the priest across the floor without

00:13:11.319 --> 00:13:12.319
touching him.

00:13:12.319 --> 00:13:13.740
She also makes him levitate.

00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:15.550
On his drop, he passes out.

00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:19.220
Menendez has a vision of himself, dressed
up in clerical attire, and wearing the mask

00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:20.650
of a plague doctor.

00:13:20.650 --> 00:13:23.910
His teeth are pulled out one by one, later
formed as a rosary.

00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:27.690
He sees his animated self directly in front
of him, so he shouts in complete terror.

00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:30.370
He wakes up to a crying Raquel on the phone
with the police.

00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:33.750
She reports that she is being tortured and
forced to do things against her will.

00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:36.800
She notices that Menendez is awake, so she
approaches him.

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:39.750
She touches the priest inappropriately, but
he commands her to stop it in the name of

00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:40.750
the Lord.

00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:44.090
Raquel continues to tease him, while her voice
changes in different tones.

00:13:44.090 --> 00:13:47.830
Menendez realizes it is also the same demon
he dealt with several years ago.

00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:51.440
The demon that now inhabits Raquel’s body
once plagued Marisa and her son.

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:54.420
The demon taunts the priest by saying that
he failed to save the boy’s soul, and he

00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:56.410
has ended up in hell with them.

00:13:56.410 --> 00:13:59.380
Sebas wakes up to find his possessed daughter
sitting on his friend’s lap.

00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:02.160
She puts on a demonic laugh as she approaches
her father.

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:04.980
She performs a sensual act on him, which disgusts
him.

00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:08.620
Menendez tells him to be strong, but Raquel
continues on doing the deed.

00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:11.470
She gets on top of him and does the deed against
his will.

00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:15.360
Sebas is distraught by this because Raquel
is his daughter and the act is highly inappropriate.

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:17.660
Menendez is able to untie himself from the
chair.

00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:20.579
He knocks Raquel on the floor while commanding
the demon to leave her body.

00:14:20.579 --> 00:14:23.730
Raquel gets on top of him and breaks his fingers
one by one.

00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:26.959
Seeing what Menendez considers the biggest
failure of his life, the demon tortures its

00:14:26.959 --> 00:14:30.300
old enemy, aware that the former priest hasn’t
forgiven himself for it.

00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:33.610
Sebas manages to knock Raquel out with a fire
extinguisher, but Menendez stops him from

00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:34.639
killing her.

00:14:34.639 --> 00:14:37.209
They bind her with the chains from the time
of the Inquisition.

00:14:37.209 --> 00:14:40.730
As Menendez explains, the chains contain the
suffering of all the possessed souls, which

00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:42.230
will torment the demon.

00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:45.069
He starts to set up a flickering light which
will keep the demon in place when it leaves

00:14:45.069 --> 00:14:46.379
the body.

00:14:46.379 --> 00:14:50.120
Sebas continues to read the holy passages
while Menendez punches her tirelessly.

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:53.569
After numerous hits, Menendez gets tired but
continues to do so.

00:14:53.569 --> 00:14:56.980
It still pains Sebas to see his daughter that
way, but he has no choice.

00:14:56.980 --> 00:15:00.139
They say the final lines of the passage together
and wait for the result.

00:15:00.139 --> 00:15:03.709
They then complete the exorcism, forcing it
to take a physical form for the first time,

00:15:03.709 --> 00:15:05.139
appearing as Menendez.

00:15:05.139 --> 00:15:08.600
The demon congratulates him, and he uses a
makeshift cross to condemn it.

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:11.830
He hallucinates and sees Marisa and Sebas
reminding him of his sins.

00:15:11.830 --> 00:15:14.870
The demon then takes its true form; a big
and ugly creature.

00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:17.209
With the cross, he manages to defeat it.

00:15:17.209 --> 00:15:21.569
He comes upstairs to reunite with Sebas and
Raquel who is now free from the demonic influence.

00:15:21.569 --> 00:15:25.019
He urges sebas to go as quickly as he can
because the cops are about to arrive any minute.

00:15:25.019 --> 00:15:27.440
He stays behind, all bloody and exhausted.

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:31.220
Raquel takes a look at him one last time to
express her gratitude for saving her soul.

00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:34.850
The telephone rings once again; Menendez says
that “it’s done” and he is now at peace.

00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:39.250
However, the phone’s cable is severed, meaning
that the call might just be in his imagination.

00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:43.089
Moments after, an entity, which looks like
a nun levitates and approaches Menendez in

00:15:43.089 --> 00:15:50.629
a demonic manner.
