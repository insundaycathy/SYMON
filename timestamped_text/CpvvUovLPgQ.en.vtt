00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:06.720
Hi, Mystery Recapped here. Today, I am&nbsp;
going to explain the first two episodes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.680
called “Red 1ight green 1ight” and “HeII”&nbsp;
from the South Korean survival drama&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.920
“SQU1D G4M3.” Spoilers ahead!&nbsp;
Watch out and take care!
&nbsp;

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.880
Seong Gi-hun is a middle-aged man&nbsp;
living in a small house with his mother.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:28.800
Gi-hun is drowning in loans and has a gambling&nbsp;
addiction, making their financial condition&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.720
very poor. At breakfast one day, Gi-hun’s mother&nbsp;
hands him some money to buy his daughter Gayeong&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:40.000
a birthday dinner. Gi-hun’s ex-wife is married to&nbsp;
a wealthy man and doesn’t let him see his daughter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.120
often, so Gi-hun is excited to see her for her&nbsp;
birthday. He asks his mother for some more money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.640
to buy Gayeon a gift as well. She says she is&nbsp;
broke at first but eventually hands him a few&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.840
extra wons. After she leaves, Gi-hun cunningly&nbsp;
gets her credit card and goes to withdraw more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.640
money with his fellow gambling friend. 
The two then place their bets on horses but are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:06.000
down on their luck as they lose every round. They&nbsp;
do not stop wasting their money even after losing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.760
almost all of it. In the end, Gi-hun finally wins&nbsp;
a decent sum of money and is over the moon. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.800
even tips the lady who hands him the money and&nbsp;
goes outside celebrating his luck. Just then,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:22.480
Gi-hun notices some men approaching him angrily.&nbsp;
They are his debtors to whom he owes a lot of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.760
money. Fearing his recent earnings might be taken,&nbsp;
he runs inside the building again and crashes into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.720
a girl accidentally. The debtors eventually catch&nbsp;
him and threaten to kill him if he doesn’t return&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:38.000
their money. A scared Gi-hun tries to give them&nbsp;
the money he just won, only to discover his pocket&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.680
empty. He realizes that the girl he crashed onto&nbsp;
earlier was a pickpocket who stole his money. 
&nbsp;

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:49.040
The debtors, however, do not care about this and&nbsp;
start hitting Gi-hun. They use a scalpel and put&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:54.320
it into his nostrils, making him plead for his&nbsp;
life. They say they will return after one month&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:00.400
and leave. Now, the man has zero money left,&nbsp;
hence he goes back to the girl he tipped earlier&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.040
and asks for his money back. He still doesn’t&nbsp;
have enough to buy his daughter a gift so,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.000
instead, he settles to winning her one from a&nbsp;
claw machine. But, with his luck, he cannot even&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.160
get one toy into the hole. A little kid beside him&nbsp;
offers to help and finally wins a black gift box.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.320
They celebrate the small win and&nbsp;
Gi-hun leaves after thanking the kid.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.440
He takes his daughter to a tteokbokki stall and&nbsp;
the two enjoy the food. Gayeong is worried to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.640
see cuts and bruises on her father’s face which&nbsp;
Gi-hun says are just mosquito bites. He hands her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.333
the gift without checking what is inside the&nbsp;
box. Gayeong is surprised to see it is a gun&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.333 --> 00:02:44.480
shaped lighter. Gi-hun takes the gift back and&nbsp;
promises to get her a better one next year. 
&nbsp;

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.520
At last, he brings his daughter to her mother&nbsp;
and parts after saying goodbye. Gi-hun is now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.240
at a train station where he is approached by a&nbsp;
well-mannered and well-dressed man. He invites&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:58.640
Gi-hun to play a game of ddakji, a game where&nbsp;
they should flip a card by hitting it with another&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:04.880
card. The man claims to give Gi-hun 100,000 won&nbsp;
if he wins but if he loses, the man will slap his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.480
face. Having nothing to lose, Gi-hun accepts the&nbsp;
offer. As they play, Gi-hun loses several rounds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:14.240
getting slapped by the man numerous times. His&nbsp;
cheek starts to bruise badly but he doesn’t stop.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:19.760
At last, he finally wins a round and gets the&nbsp;
money he was promised. Then, the well-dressed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.960
man hands him a card asking him to call the number&nbsp;
if he wants to play more games like this. On his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:30.400
way home, Gi-hun meets an old woman who is his&nbsp;
friend Sangwoo’s mother. She boasts about her son&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.200
currently being on a business trip to the US. 
At night, Gi-hun and his mother are having&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.040
dinner when she tells him that his&nbsp;
ex-wife’s family is moving to the US.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:44.960
Hence, he won’t be able to see Gayeong again.&nbsp;
Gi-hun is shocked but cannot do anything because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:49.120
his ex-wife has the complete custody of his&nbsp;
daughter because of his financial problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.400
At night, in desperation, he calls the number&nbsp;
the man gave him and is called to a place nearby.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:00.240
A van pulls up in front of him and he is asked to&nbsp;
get inside. As soon as he steps in, a gas spreads&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:05.040
throughout the vehicle that knocks him out. When&nbsp;
he wakes up, Gi-hun is in a bunk bed with several&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:10.080
other people around him. His clothes have been&nbsp;
changed and all of his belongings are gone. 
&nbsp;

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:14.400
Everyone seems to be as confused as him. We see&nbsp;
that everyone in the room is being monitored&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:20.480
through cameras. Gi-hun meets an old man who has&nbsp;
the number 001 written on his vest while Gi-hun&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:26.000
has 456 written on it. The man says that he is&nbsp;
suffering from a brain tumour. As they talk,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.960
a fight catches their attention. The girl who has&nbsp;
stolen Gi-hun’s money the previous day is fighting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.920
with a man who seems to be a gangster. Gi-hun&nbsp;
interferes and threatens the girl to give him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:41.040
his money back. Their argument is stopped when the&nbsp;
facility’s staff, dressed in red suits and masks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:45.680
enter the room. They welcome the people and&nbsp;
announce that they will be playing six games&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.720
in six days, and those who win all six&nbsp;
of them will win a lot of prize money.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.640
One of the participants is Sangwoo, Gi-hun’s&nbsp;
childhood friend who was supposed to be on a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:59.760
business trip to the US according to his mother.&nbsp;
It turns out that he is wanted by the police&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:05.920
because he owes his client a total of six hundred&nbsp;
fifty million won. So, he lied to his mother.
&nbsp;

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:10.240
Shortly after, a sphere is brought to&nbsp;
the ceiling of the room which the staff&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:15.120
claims will be filled with money once they&nbsp;
complete the first game. Everyone is confused&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:20.160
but agrees to play the game anyway. They are made&nbsp;
to sign a rule book that has only three rules,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:26.960
1, players are not allowed to stop playing once&nbsp;
the game has started, 2, The player who refuses&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:33.600
to play will be eliminated, and 3, The games will&nbsp;
be terminated if the majority agrees. Everyone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:38.720
signs the form and gets ready for the first&nbsp;
game. Outside the room is a maze-like hallway.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:43.600
The contestants are made to take pictures and then&nbsp;
are taken to a field that has a creepy statue of a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:49.600
doll on one side. Gi-hun approaches his old friend&nbsp;
Sangwoo and asks him why he lied to his mother. As&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:54.560
they talk, they are interrupted by an announcement&nbsp;
asking them to stay behind the white line. 
&nbsp;

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:59.360
Somewhere inside the facility, the overse1er of&nbsp;
the games gets a call from someone. He takes his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:04.240
place in front of the monitor and watches everyone&nbsp;
play. Back in the field, the contestants are told&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.880
that the first game is “red light green light”&nbsp;
they have ten minutes to complete the game. As&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:11.200
the statue of a girl says red light, they have to&nbsp;
freeze, and they can only move forward when the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:16.560
girl is turning around and saying green light. If&nbsp;
anyone is caught moving, the statue will sense the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:23.360
motion and the person will be eliminated. The game&nbsp;
begins and goes on regularly for a while. That is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:29.680
until the statue detects a motion and one man is&nbsp;
eliminated. He is shot dead at the very moment.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:35.120
The others do not comprehend what is happening so&nbsp;
they play the next round. But soon, they find out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:41.360
the people who are eliminated are killed. Chaos&nbsp;
ensues and people start running around and getting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:46.960
shot. A pile of dead bodies falls around the&nbsp;
entrance and the place turns into a bloodbath. 
&nbsp;

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:55.920
Only a few contestants remain frozen in fear.&nbsp;
From the next round, everyone starts being more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:01.120
careful. Gi-hun is still frozen on the ground&nbsp;
but moves when Sangwoo asks him to. He almost&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:07.040
falls down once but is saved by a man behind him&nbsp;
named Ali. More people die as the game continues&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:12.800
and in the end, some of them finally pass the game&nbsp;
including Gi-hun, Sangwoo, the pickpocket girl&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:20.080
Saebyeok, the old man Ilnam, the gangster Deoksu,&nbsp;
and the guy who saved Gi-hun, Ali. As the camera&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:24.880
pans out, we see that they are on a secluded&nbsp;
island, and the facility is underground. 
&nbsp;

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:30.000
The staff clean up the dead bodies and burn them&nbsp;
in furnaces. The surviving contestants are brought&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.040
back to the room and are shaken by what they just&nbsp;
witnessed. Gi-hun thanks Ali for saving his life&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:40.160
earlier. Right then, the staff enter the room and&nbsp;
congratulate them for completing the first round.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:48.080
The number of contestants decreases from 456 to&nbsp;
201, meaning that 255 contestants were killed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:52.000
One of the girls falls down on her&nbsp;
knees and begs the staff to let them go.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.800
The others join and do the same. Soon,&nbsp;
everyone is asking them to let them go free.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:01.360
However, the staff reminds them the second rule&nbsp;
of the game and threatens to kill them if they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:06.240
refuse to play. But Sangwoo claps back with the&nbsp;
third rule according to which if the majority&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:11.280
agrees to end the game, they will. The staff&nbsp;
agrees but wants to show them the price money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:17.120
before voting. The sphere that was on the ceiling&nbsp;
earlier is then filled with bundles of money. 
&nbsp;

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:23.120
The staff claims the winner will be able to take&nbsp;
home 45.6 billion won. But if they decide to stop&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:28.160
playing, the families of the dead people will&nbsp;
receive a hundred million won each and they will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:33.440
get nothing. The prize money tempts everyone and&nbsp;
the ones who were against the game earlier start&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:40.560
voting for it to continue. The winning vote is&nbsp;
decided by Ilnam who votes for it to end. Finally,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:44.640
they will be allowed to go home without any&nbsp;
damage. The staff says that if the majority&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:48.880
of them want to play the game again, they&nbsp;
will be contacted. In the following scene,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:54.560
Gu-hun and Saebyeok are thrown out of a van with&nbsp;
their hands tied. The same happens with Ali and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:59.440
Sangwoo. All of them go their separate ways.&nbsp;
Sangwoo even hands Ali some money for his bus&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:03.840
fare. Gi-hun goes to the police directly and&nbsp;
tells them about his kidnapping. But they find&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:09.120
it hard to believe that the kidnappers sent him&nbsp;
back because he voted for it. One police officer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:14.320
named Junho is at the station as well. The card&nbsp;
Gi-hun is holding catches his attention. 
&nbsp;

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:18.880
Gi-hun then goes back to his home only to find&nbsp;
his mother missing. It turns out that she is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:23.920
severely diabetic and has been admitted to the&nbsp;
hospital because of extreme pain. Gi-hun rushes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:29.040
to the hospital to see his mother’s feet covered&nbsp;
in wounds. The doctors say only surgery can save&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:34.800
her life, but they cannot afford it. Elsewhere, we&nbsp;
see the police officer Junho talking to his mother&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:39.840
about his brother. Junho’s brother has been&nbsp;
missing for a few days now which worries him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:44.000
At his brother’s apartment, he finds the&nbsp;
same card that Gi-hun was showing the police&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:50.320
earlier. He decides to follow Gi-hun and ask him&nbsp;
about the card. Meanwhile, the pickpocket Saebyeok&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:55.280
goes to meet her brother in an orphanage. It turns&nbsp;
out that the girl is a North Korean escapee whose&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:55.280 --> 00:10:00.160
parents are still stuck in North Korea. She&nbsp;
wants to collect more money to get her back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:04.800
and get her brother out of the orphanage.  
Ali, on the other hand, goes to his work to meet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:10.640
his boss. He has come to Korea from Pakistan to&nbsp;
earn money but he hasn’t been paid for six months&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:15.840
now. He has his wife and a little son at home&nbsp;
who he has to fend for. Ali’s boss has a bundle&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:21.600
of money in front of him but he refuses to pay. An&nbsp;
enraged Ali accidentally pushes him to a machine,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:26.480
making his fingers smash. He takes the&nbsp;
money and runs away right after. At home,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:31.280
he hands his wife the money and asks her to run&nbsp;
back to Pakistan with their son. He assures her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:35.920
that he will come back later, hugging his&nbsp;
wife for the last time before leaving. 
&nbsp;

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:40.720
Meanwhile, Sangwoo calls his mother and&nbsp;
lies to her about being in the US. His&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:45.600
mother happily asks him not to get her any gifts&nbsp;
and ends the phone call. Right after the call,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:50.000
the old woman is approached by some police&nbsp;
officers asking her about Sangwoo. They tell&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.720
her that he is under investigation for stealing&nbsp;
his clients’ money and ask her to report him if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:58.560
he comes to her. The woman is shocked and&nbsp;
embarrassed in front of her customers. 
&nbsp;

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:04.400
At the same time, Sangwoo receives a card from the&nbsp;
same facility again. Gi-hun, on the other hand,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:09.840
has no way to treat his mother’s illness. He goes&nbsp;
to his ex-wife to ask her for help but she refuses&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:15.120
to help him. As they talk, her new husband and&nbsp;
their children return home. Gi-hun walks out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:20.000
only to be called by the husband. He hands&nbsp;
him a bundle of money and asks Gi-hun to never&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:26.000
approach his family again. An enraged Gi-hun beats&nbsp;
him, claiming that he cannot take his daughter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.120
away. Right then, his daughter comes outside&nbsp;
and sees her father hitting her stepfather.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:36.000
