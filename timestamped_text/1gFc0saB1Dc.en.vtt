00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.130
Welcome to Cinema Summary, ladies and
gentlemen. Today's movie is an edgy

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.849
coming-of-age story about a girl and her
experiences and her blog. This is...

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:13.980
Ask Me Anything

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.660
Our main character is Katie
Kampenfelt, a 17 year old who reflects on

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.119
her decision to take a gap year before
she goes to college. She wants to do it

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.840
to get some perspective on her future
and when Katie goes to her counselor she

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.619
suggested to blog during her gap year
Katie agrees though as soon as she

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.920
leaves she lights up a smoke she's not
as innocent as she seems

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.540
why is she actually taking a gap year?
Well a love affair of course! Meet Dan a

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.110
thirtysomething year-old guy who she
sleeps with and both of them are cheating

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.890
on their partners. Dan teaches film at a
community college and together they

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.289
usually watch classic movies and get
'physical'

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.579
Katie likes him because she feels smarter
next soon as she's getting it on, she

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.059
remembers something herself as a little
girl on a road trip with her dad when she

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.570
comes out of her flashback Dan tells her
that he's moving out closer to the

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.140
college it's not good for their
relationship though she convinces Dan to

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.589
continue their thing. Katie tells her mom
about her blog that she writes under a

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.840
fake name with changes made to hide the names of

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.770
the real people she talks about when Mr.
Moustache, our given name for the not-yet

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.729
stepdad of Katie comes in he
questions her choices something that he

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.800
does a lot based on how Katie storms off
while she walks around town we hear an

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.180
extract from her blog the reveals things
about her promiscuous nature

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.860
"What's your favorite number?" 69

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.570
she enters the Sam Johnson book shop to apply for a job

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.950
where she's hired by Glenn Warburg three
days a week $12 an hour in a room she

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.610
talks about how her blog has gotten a
lot of views though mostly from people

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.380
searching for creepy search words like
"blonde", "sex", and "high school" afterwards we

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.430
meet Rory he's her typical looking high
school boyfriend and while he's watches

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.939
TV Katie blogs about how her fans
don't care that she's cheating on her

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.750
boyfriend just that it's with an older
guy who had a girlfriend. In her defense

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.470
she didn't know he had a girlfriend at
first the next day after having sex Rory

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.680
Katie comes back to the book shop and
talks with Glenn where he describes

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.030
reading as a transcendent spiritual
experience. It's food for thought. She

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.570
goes to Dan's house which is abandoned.
he hadn't even said goodbye or called her

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:12.060
The only way she could see him now
is to go to him so she needs a car she

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.819
heads to her biological dad home where
she asks her dad into getting her a car

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:19.239
she fails to convince him and when she
leaves she gets a message from Joel

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:23.230
Seidler, a senior at Princeton who wants to
tutored Katie who wants to meet with her if she

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.500
can and she gets another message from a
girl named Jade

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.140
"I'm back, b***h!" *Katie laughs*

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.720
Her best friend who got back from Greece.They light up a nice little join in a cemetery

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:38.439
and have a typical girly chat. Jade is relieved when
Katie tells her that she isn't seeing Dan

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:42.909
since you know she has Rory though even
if Rory's around she could be a bit

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:46.870
loose. Later, she has a meeting of her mom
and 'Moustache" who tell her that Glenn the

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.430
bookshop owner was a convicted rapist and
she quits working at the bookshop lying

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.620
to him that it's because it wouldn't
look good on a resume

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.459
afterwards she gets a call from Paul
Spooner who has a job offer for her to

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:02.650
work as a nanny and offers a free car
Katie's thrilled! She can work and she'll

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.790
get a car too. She works as a nanny for
the son of Paul and Margaret Spooner but

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.480
she has to stop blogging to do so. 
After Katie leaves work she makes a plan to

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.799
contact Dan: she goes over to Jade's home
where she and Jade called Dan and asked

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:19.209
him to call her later as she leaves she
gets a call from Joel again which he

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:23.500
ignores and she gets another call this
time from Dan who doesn't sound thrilled

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.069
that Katie has a car though he changes
his mind once she tells him that she can

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:29.620
give it a blowy. *Narrator laughs and muses*

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:30.780
Dan and Katie have sex and she has a

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.690
flashback to a memory of a man who
leaves her when she wakes up, Dan

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.599
confesses that he doesn't want to do
this anymore, Dan and his girlfriend

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:41.139
Martine have been engaged for a while, they're a lot closer in age and they're

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:45.699
compatible as Katie leaves she realizes
that Dan moved so that he could live of

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:49.659
Martine she returns home where Rory, her
mom, and Mr. Moustache have been waiting

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:53.349
for her. Katie lies that she saw a movie
and runs to her room Rory doesn't

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:56.560
believe her so she tells him that she's
been cheating on him Rory always hits

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.489
her but is kicked out by Mr. Moustache.
The next morning Katie confesses to her

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:04.510
mom about Dan and Katie's relationship
but lies to her about not having sex with

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.650
Dan. Her birthday is spent moping and she
confesses on her blog that she's glad

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.190
that Katie isn't her real name and
although miserable she drives to the

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.790
Spooner's house or they are having a
party she, mingles and drinks and has a

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.090
flirty moment with mr. Spooner when she
gets home she gets another call from

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:21.969
Joel who confesses that he wanted
someone to talk to since he almost

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:25.930
jumped out of a window during college
and since Katie had spent time in a

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:27.880
mental hospital, maybe she'd understand him.

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.720
At Christmas she gives gifts and cards
to her down in his new girlfriend of

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.170
Afreen. Later her dad reminisce about the
old days when they were younger and

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:39.520
closer in fact on the day her dad got
kicked out she held on to him as long as

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:44.560
she could except Katie doesn't recall this
moment to her dismay. At home she

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.190
complains: about her loneliness she broke
up with Rory and JD's busy with her new

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:51.490
boyfriend. Her mom and Moustache come in
and tell her that they got engaged after

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:55.870
that she calls Rory who reveals that he
has been sleeping with Jade and they

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:59.560
are now dating after leaving work she
gets a message from Joel and we finally

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.430
get to meet Mr. Seidler at Katie's
request they have wine and Katie

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.630
complains about Rory and Jade to Joel
Joel points out that Katie's bad luck is

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:11.440
due to her poor choices in men and her
lack of self-awareness which she snidely

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:15.580
accepts. That night she gets a call
it's about her dad: he had a fall and

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.420
something exploded in his brain. He's in
bad condition, later we find out that her

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:23.710
dad has passed away. In a somber blog
post she reflects on her dad's death she

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:27.970
has no one to talk to no guy to lean on
her dad is dead and Dan is busy over

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:32.470
Martine. There's no outlet and she misses
work because of it. Getting back to work

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:36.100
the life of the Spooner's has changed
Margaret has a full-time job now though

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:39.970
the baby still needs to be nannied so
Paul is eating lunch at home to keep the

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:43.810
baby company Katie and Paul have a deep
conversation about bad times moving on

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:47.200
and how when you're 30 bad things happen
and other things when she leaves she

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:51.100
gets her pay and a paper from Paul about
lessons about adulthood. Meeting with Joel

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:55.930
he realises why Paul wrote that: Paul
wants to bang Katie Joel also figures a

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:00.100
few things out about Katie
she likes sex, she's self-centered, she's

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:05.440
a borderline alcoholic, similar symptoms
to a girl that Joel knew so Joel asks

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:09.340
her if she was ever molested when she
was young she confesses to Joel that

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:12.280
they summer before her parents divorced
she was sent over to the next-door

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:16.030
neighbor's home to watch TV where she
was molested by a man and Katie admits

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:19.900
that it felt kind of good. She posts
about this in her blog and the reception

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:23.380
is mixed from name-calling to support
two comically missing the point

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:28.150
the next day Katie asks her mom to get
therapy. At the therapists office she

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:31.300
reveals that when she was 13 she had
taken a bunch of her mom's ambien and

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:34.690
broke it to a guy's house to confess to
him, he rejected her and she didn't take

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:37.600
it well. She was sent to a mental
hospital which was an experience that

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.040
made her not like therapy.

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:42.440
Miss Sherman, her therapist asks Katie to write a letter to the man

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.559
who molested her for her own relief she

00:06:44.559 --> 00:06:48.159
listens to Paul complain about Margaret
and in a secretive way he gives her a

00:06:48.159 --> 00:06:52.629
necklace she loves it and they share a
passionate kiss before Margaret comes in

00:06:52.629 --> 00:06:56.620
she arrives home where she meets Rory
and they have sex during which she

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:01.360
remembers some things an older man who
drank and the little girl and after sex

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:03.304
she realizes that she's in love of Paul

00:07:03.304 --> 00:07:05.440
Let's get a little real here for those

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.500
who are unaware: because she was molested and her dad left her at a young age

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:13.719
she became confused by what love is so she
filled the dad shape hole her heart with

00:07:13.719 --> 00:07:17.949
the emotional and physical joy that sex
brings to her when she has sex with

00:07:17.949 --> 00:07:21.819
older men. In the end, her sexual
adventures are out of this need for a

00:07:21.819 --> 00:07:25.360
loving father. Out of this need for sexual control, out of this confusion

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:30.260
by what love is and so
she finds it in all the wrong places

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:31.560
Back to the movie.

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:33.760
Back at the Spooner
home she and Paul have sex and

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:37.360
experience that makes Katie feels
special and all this time she hasn't

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:41.110
blogged once. Later Katie forges the
email from her mom to cancel future

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:44.139
appointments with her therapist and
sometime after that she gets a call from

00:07:44.139 --> 00:07:47.409
Joel who is bitter at her cold shoulder
treatment and is mad at her for

00:07:47.409 --> 00:07:50.979
throwing away a platonic friendship with
the one guy who doesn't want to bang her

00:07:50.979 --> 00:07:55.029
and actually cares about her beyond sex
she takes it personally, breaking down

00:07:55.029 --> 00:07:59.229
into tears when she realizes how extreme
her reaction is she takes a pregnancy

00:07:59.229 --> 00:08:03.249
test to check if it's due to hormones.
It checks positive that night Katie

00:08:03.249 --> 00:08:06.219
tells Rory that she's pregnant though
she might abort it and it's probably not

00:08:06.219 --> 00:08:10.779
Rory's. Rory is disgusting screaming at
her that she's such a whore so she tries

00:08:10.779 --> 00:08:14.169
to call Joel only to find that he tried
to kill himself again

00:08:14.169 --> 00:08:17.379
The Spooner's celebrate Paul's birthday
and while Margaret attends to the baby

00:08:17.379 --> 00:08:20.830
Paul and Katie shamelessly take that
moment to make out after which she gives

00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:24.759
him a birthday gift a poem admitting her
feelings to Paul which Paul rips apart

00:08:24.759 --> 00:08:28.779
Katie's pregnancy is difficult and Paul
doesn't want anything to do with it so she tries to

00:08:28.779 --> 00:08:32.680
get medicated and gets denied by her
therapist. A night walk has Katie deliver

00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:35.829
a letter: the letter to the man who
molested her getting psychological

00:08:35.829 --> 00:08:39.490
release after all this time but then she
meets her guidance counselor who gives

00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:43.149
her words of encouragement after Katie
confesses to her how hard her gap-year is

00:08:43.149 --> 00:08:47.620
Katie takes a strange turn for the night
and visits Glenn for advice she tells

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:51.250
him the truth about why she quit about
finding his criminal record and wants to

00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:54.370
know what he did he tells her that a
long time ago he was a real

00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:59.020
piece of work: rebellious, angry, dealing
drugs, and got dishonorably discharged

00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:01.660
from the Army.
he slept of a prostitute after they got

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:05.290
drunk and high and since he couldn't
remember anything that happened he was

00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:09.430
charged with rape. After hearing this
Katie tells about her baby and her fears

00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:12.520
of having it he believes that she's
scared of what she'll feel after the

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:16.060
abortion but no one's felt bad about
having a kid and gives her some advice

00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:21.910
Stop drinking. Stop smoking and stop
sleeping around. Just before she leaves

00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:25.420
Glenn tells her to keep the baby and if
she can handle it he will take care of

00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:30.010
it leaving her speechless as she relaxes
in the bath we cut to the film reel as

00:09:30.010 --> 00:09:33.430
she wonders if she wants to stop
blogging if it's possible to become

00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:37.960
normal, to be free from her blog and be
her own self: free from fame and

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:42.190
obligation and as the little girl jumps
into the lake, Katie chooses to live her

00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:45.490
own life
fade to black but it's not over yet!

00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:50.950
Meet Carol, the mother of Amy Grantham a.k.a. the
real Katie Kampenfelt. That's right we

00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:55.180
were just another reader of Katie's blog
I mean she did say that she ran under a

00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:57.920
fake name and she changed the names of
everyone involved in her life

00:09:57.920 --> 00:09:59.580
Do you see what's happening here guys?

00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:01.480
We just found out that we were just another one of the

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:05.260
readers of Katie's blog who all this
time had been imagining her life based

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:09.279
on what she wrote just to find out that
her real life is slightly different the

00:10:09.279 --> 00:10:12.490
thing she said before were from her
final blog post before she just

00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:16.390
disappeared. Before she left, Amy had
gotten a call from a blocked number but

00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:19.460
other than that there is no trail for
anyone to follow.

00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:24.320
Carol Grantham types out a final blog post about the reality of "Katie's" life or should I say, Amy?

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:28.300
Rory is a young man
named Aidan who would never hurt her, Dan

00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:32.080
is a video store manager who was never
told that she was pregnant and the way

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:35.500
she wrote about their relationship was a
little inaccurate. The Spooners are a

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:38.589
small family though "Paul" denies any
sexual relations

00:10:38.589 --> 00:10:42.740
Jake Seidler is much like Joel regretting
his last vicious voice message to Amy

00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:44.740
Jade is a drug addict named Noel and

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:47.580
although she has a blocked number she
didn't call Amy

00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:49.100
"Glenn" is Roy Olsen

00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:53.320
whose story was mostly true except he never said he
would take care of her baby

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:56.120
She (Carol) asks Amy's fans to give her some information

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:57.860
any information about her baby girl

00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:01.540
No matter how many times she reads Amy's
blogs, no matter how long they wait

00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:05.410
they'll never know who would hurt Amy
because it seems that in Katie's world

00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:06.980
everyone would

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:08.350
