00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.790
Rich people of this world are living their
lives in a space center named ‘’Elysium’’

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:08.700
outside the space.-
On the other hand, poor people are leading

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.830
a life in land pollution and miserable condition.
Everyone is leading a luxurious life in ‘’Elysium’’

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.750
and the poor are in utmost difficulties.
Elysium had a machine that could cure any

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.600
disease.
Not only this, but it could re-grow any part

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.670
of the human body.
It could also stop aging.

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:32.489
Everyone in Elysium had this machine.
This whole space centre was made by the owner

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.879
of Elysium.
Now we see a little kid named ‘’Max’’.

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:40.999
He sees a dream that he’ll take his friend
to Elysium when he grows up.

00:00:40.999 --> 00:00:46.420
When he grows up, he starts stealing.
Police arrest him. ‘’Max’’ is released

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.309
on bail.
He starts working in a company.

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.370
This company was owned by the owner of Elysium,
which made weapons and robots for Elysium.

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.989
One day, ‘’Max’’ goes to work and
the police scan him.

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:03.120
Robot Police beat ‘’Max’’ black and
blue and injure him.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.650
‘’Max’’ goes to the hospital for treatment.
Here, he finds the same girl, with whom he

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.370
did friendship.
She was a nurse now.

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:16.510
After seeing each other after so long, ‘’Max’’
offers her a coffee.

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:20.470
But she refuses and goes away after plastering
his hand.

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:26.090
Work on the Earth was being performed by Robots.
Poor people weren’t allowed to enter ‘’Elysium’’

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.670
and if someone mistakenly entered it, he got
shot.

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.620
There were many sick people on the Earth who
wanted to go to the Elysium

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:38.830
because Elysium had that machine. By using
it, they wanted to cure themselves.

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.400
‘’Spider’’ named man used to send
his spaceship to Elysium secretly.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.610
‘’Spider’’ sends 3 spaceships full
of people to Elysium.

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.170
As they move, Defense Secretary gets the wind
of it.

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.490
He orders to destroy those ships full of people
through missiles.

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.080
Two out of three spaceships are destroyed
in the Space and the remaining one lands in

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.230
Elysium.
People get out of that ship and enter the

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:06.750
houses of rich people and try to use that
machine to cure their diseases.

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.269
At the same moment, Robot Police come, capture
them, and send them back to the Earth.

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:16.099
In the next scene, we talk about ‘’John
Carlyle’’ who used to go the Earth daily

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:20.689
to manage things.
In the evening, he used to go back to Elysium.

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:25.860
‘’Max’’ was working in his company.
The door of the radioactive chamber gets locked

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.010
during work.
The manager of ‘’Max’’ asks him to

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.190
check the chamber by going inside it.
"Max" accidentally needs to enter, and its

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:39.000
door is locked from the inside, instituting
the irradiated process.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.489
Radiation has a negative impact on ‘'Max."
Outdoor, people try to open the door and end

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:49.060
up taking him out.
The robot scans him, gives him medicine, and

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.530
tells him that he’ll die within 5 days.
‘’Max’’ goes to the house in grief

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:58.030
and on the way, he meets his friend.
His friend tells him that he knows a man who

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.109
goes to Elysium.
We’ll go to Elysium by taking his spaceship

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:05.599
and use that machine which cures people’s
diseases.

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:10.340
On the very next day, they both go to ‘’Spider’’
who takes his ship to Elysium.

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.879
But he refuses to take them because ‘’Max’’
had an old enmity with this man.

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:19.980
That man fixes a device in ‘’Max’’.
‘’Max’’ feels better because of it.

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.650
On the other hand, the President of Elysium
‘’John Carlyle’’ comes to the Earth

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:28.170
to monitor his company.
Now he sets out for Elysium. ‘’Max’’

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.609
and his team attack his satellite and shoot
‘’John’’.

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:36.459
‘’Max’’ immediately downloads the
data from his mind to his neural system.

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:40.469
After copying, he gets understood that this
whole information is encrypted.

00:03:40.469 --> 00:03:45.470
Now, the agent and Max’s team get into a
fight and they kill Max’s friend.

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.410
‘’Max’’ runs out of there and hides
in his childhood friend’s house, who was

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.370
a nurse now.
‘’Max’’ sees that his friend had a

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:56.709
daughter as well.
She had cancer and only that machine in Elysium

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:00.930
is able to cure this.
She asks him to take her daughter to Elysium

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.769
somehow so that she can recover.
‘’Max’’ couldn’t help her and gets

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:10.220
out of there because an agent was behind him.
He gets to know about his last location.

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:15.309
Now, this agent comes to Max’s friend’s
house and asks about ‘’Max’’.

00:04:15.309 --> 00:04:19.099
When she doesn’t answer, he kidnaps both
of them so that he can find ‘’Max’’

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:21.829
through them.
‘’Max’’ now comes to ‘’Spider’’

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:26.460
who told him all the codes of Elysium.
He connects Max’s brain with a computer

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:31.349
and analyzes that if the information of all
the people are put in this program

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:35.870
and then installed in Elysium so can people
of earth become part of Elysium?

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:40.169
He wanted to know this now.
When he tries to do this, he realizes that

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:44.849
the satellite got jammed.
This was now impossible to update or download

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:49.539
any program.
Now, he’ll not be able to help ‘’Max’’.

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:54.490
Now he asks ‘’Max’’ to leave.
Signals are down due to John’s death.

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:59.470
That’s why this program is not of use now.
‘’Max’’ wasn’t left with any way

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.639
now.
So, he chooses to surrender himself.

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:08.160
When the agent comes to kill him, he blackmails
him that if he doesn’t take him to Elysium,

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:13.850
he’ll blow him up with this bomb.
Agent laughs and agrees. He tells ‘’Delacourt’’

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:17.190
that he has captured ‘’Max’’ and he
wants to come to Elysium.

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:20.629
‘’Max’’ sees his friend and her daughter
on the same ship.

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:24.870
Now, ‘’Max’’ couldn’t do anything
because the agent had tied him up.

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:30.510
‘'Max" and that agent are battling on this
ship. During a fight, it blows up, wounding

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:34.830
the agent's face.
As the ship comes to a halt, Max's friend

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:39.909
takes her daughter and tries to use the machine.
But the machine doesn't work as it only works

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:43.740
on Elysium's people.
They bring that agent to that machine and

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:48.430
his face recovers and the machine works.
‘’Max’’ and that agent fights again

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:51.860
and ‘’Max’’ kills him.
‘’Max’’ throws him from the roof and

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:55.570
he dies.
On the other hand, her friend gets succeeded

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:59.449
in curing her daughter.
Another ship from Elysium goes to provide

00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:03.449
medical help to the people of Earth.
People’s lives become easy with it and the

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:03.460
story ends here.
