and disappointed he tells the guys to go anyway on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:17.520
their way ben and carter notice the towns deserted&nbsp;
as they can't see anyone and the radio map playing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:22.240

shows up the zombie stripper climbs the pole&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:44.880

boys run and find the bouncer as a zombie too&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:49.920

from a stripper she pulls him out from behind the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:55.280

glass bottle in her head which causes blood to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:01.040
pour from the open wound onto his face the bouncer&nbsp;
tries getting ben in the bathroom when denise&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:06.080

a shotgun and blasts the bouncer's head off&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.280

realize that they are indeed dealing with a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:17.200
zombie breakout they run to ben's car as a horde&nbsp;
of zombies approach ben drives like crazy out of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:23.360
there causing the car's tire to fall off denise&nbsp;
holds off the zombies with a shotgun as the boys&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:34.720
other than a weird collection of dolly parton&nbsp;
items augie then goes to use the toilet a zombie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:39.680
tries getting him from the toilet window but&nbsp;
fortunately augie is done and returns to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

living room to find zombie rogers he chases&nbsp;
augie through the house all the way to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:50.800
basement where augie grabs a can of lighter fluid&nbsp;
and a gas lighter to set his scout leader on fire&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:56.320
he then ties rogers up and leaves ben carter&nbsp;
and denise go to the sheriff's department and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:02.000
see a sign that says the town's been evacuated&nbsp;
the zombie horde gets closer and the three run&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:08.000
inside the cops have been zombified as well one is&nbsp;
trying to shoot them ben uses a fire extinguisher&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.520
on the zombie cop while carter grabs an axe and&nbsp;
hits it on the zombie cop's head meanwhile the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:18.560
other zombies are about to reach them forcing them&nbsp;
to lock themselves in a cell augie later shows up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:24.400
after seeing ben's car and blasts the music from a&nbsp;
car outside to distract the zombies as the zombies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:30.240
leave the three try to get the key from the wall&nbsp;
ben uses carter's condoms as a chain and manages&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:34.800
to grab the keys until augie shows up and&nbsp;
accidentally kicks them into a drain pipe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:40.720
fortunately augie picks the lock with his knife&nbsp;
a zombie comes in but ben impales it through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:46.240
the head as they head out while a horde of zombie&nbsp;
pursuing them carter tries to close a gate against&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:51.280
the zombies a female police zombie attempt to&nbsp;
get through but her shirt gets hooked to the gate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:56.160
exposing her bare chest while carter touches it&nbsp;
the four walk down the road and encounter the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:01.760
drunken bum as a zombie augie attempts to assert&nbsp;
himself using his scout's knowledge leading him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:06.960
and carter to sing baby one more time with a&nbsp;
zombie after they notice is britney spears shirt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:12.400
they sing along with a zombie until a bullet then&nbsp;
goes through the bum's head fired by a soldier he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:17.040
takes the four to the address that carter was&nbsp;
given for the party so they can save kendall&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:22.240
however jeff gave carter the address to a sewage&nbsp;
plant augie tells carter now he knows what it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:27.600
like to be screwed over carter then admits that he&nbsp;
and ben were already planning to quit being scouts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:33.600
this makes augie tell carter that ben has a crush&nbsp;
on kendall angering carter as the boys fight the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:38.880
soldier turns into a zombie from a bite on his&nbsp;
hand before he meet them and attacks denise the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:43.600

head with the car door to make things worse&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:48.800
they hear on the radio that the town is to be&nbsp;
bombed in less than two hours carter deduces that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:53.440
kendall probably wrote the location of the party&nbsp;
in her diary so they take the truck to his house&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.800
they go into carter's house to find the diary&nbsp;
they look through kendall's room until they hear a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:04.960
noise from downstairs carter and augie go to check&nbsp;
it out denise then sees a picture of kendall and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:11.440

lack of confidence she tells ben to kiss her he&nbsp;&nbsp;

but there are too many zombies on the trampoline&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:51.280
