00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:05.680
A God of death has just given you the power&nbsp;
to eliminate anyone in the world, by writing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.560
down their name. But a genius detective is&nbsp;
predicting your every move and trying to end you.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:15.280
You'll have to manipulate friends and family and&nbsp;
hunt anyone who gets in your way to stay ahead.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.160
But you're only one mistake away from getting&nbsp;
caught. The abilities of this notebook are not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.440
perfectly balanced. So I'm going to break down the&nbsp;
mistakes made, how to exploit this notebook to its&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:30.560
deadliest potential, and how to be the death God&nbsp;
himself, and outsmart everyone in Death Note.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.240
This kid is about to become the deadliest serial&nbsp;
killer in the world. Light here is a law student&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:43.120
and is frustrated by the failing justice system&nbsp;
in Japan. Looking for answers, he decides to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.440
hack into the police database and discovers&nbsp;
that tons of criminals are being released&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.560
and never punished for their crimes. But luckily,&nbsp;
he'll soon have the power to fix this problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:58.320
Wanting to see for himself, he goes to a seedy&nbsp;
bar to spy on a criminal. This guy here is a child&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.800
killer and starts bragging about how nobody could&nbsp;
lock him up. Light is threatened at knife point,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.520
by this gang and forced out of the bar. But&nbsp;
outside, he finds a mysterious black book laying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.080
in the street. He takes it home and cracks it&nbsp;
open, learning that this book has special powers,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.120
but with those powers come a set of five rules.
The first rule is if you writes down someone's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:22.960
true name on its pages, that person will die in&nbsp;
40 seconds. Okay. Most of us would be skeptical&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.840
here because magic doesn't exist. But there's&nbsp;
no way we're not going to test it out. The most&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.000
tempting thing to do is write down the name&nbsp;
of someone you might already know and hate.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.960
But this could associate you with the death. So&nbsp;
I would make a hard rule to never kill anyone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.840
I've met before. The next mistake is to write&nbsp;
down a public figure that you might dislike.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.320
The death would get way too much attention from&nbsp;
the government and would be heavily investigate.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.360
The smartest way to test this is to kill someone&nbsp;
who is already expected to die. So that in the off&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.240
chance this is real, you aren't doing too much&nbsp;
damage and it's not obvious that you did it.&nbsp;

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.640
I would research who the world's oldest living&nbsp;
person is and write their name down. They've had&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.280
a good long life and everyone was expecting them&nbsp;
to drop dead. So it's not going to be a surprise&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.760
to anyone when they croak. Now killing is fun&nbsp;
and all, but the financial exploits of this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:14.080
book could be huge. We have a power that a lot of&nbsp;
people would envy. So if you know your way around&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.560
the dark web, you could offer assassinations and&nbsp;
get filthy rich. We'll soon find out there are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.400
other rules to this book that can be exploited&nbsp;
and light doesn't know them yet, but they could&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.560
pay off big time. Now this brings us to the&nbsp;
second rule of the Death Note. It will only&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.120
take effect if the writer knows the person's face&nbsp;
and thinks of it as they write their name down.&nbsp;

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.520
Light here decides to test it out on a wanted&nbsp;
killer announced on the news. And the next day&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.400
he reads an article about how that same man was&nbsp;
found dead from a heart attack. It might be a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.360
strange coincidence, but he wanted to conform if&nbsp;
this power is real. Later that night, he tracks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.560
down the child murderer from the bar and writes&nbsp;
his name in the Death Note. 40 seconds later, the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.360
killer collapses to the ground and Light here is&nbsp;
shocked to see he's died from a heart attack just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.560
like the first guy. This law student is now the&nbsp;
most dangerous person on the planet. And with a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:06.000
taste for blood, he's just getting started. Okay,&nbsp;
you might think that dying from a heart attack&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.120
won't arouse suspicion, but Light here will soon&nbsp;
find out that this is a serious lapse of judgment.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:16.160
For starters, Japan has one of the lowest coronary&nbsp;
heart disease death rates in the entire world.&nbsp;

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:21.200
Partly because it has less problems with obesity,&nbsp;
but if scores of healthy sushi, eating criminals&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.520
start to die from heart attacks, this won't go&nbsp;
unnoticed. And we have to be smart about how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:30.160
to use this power without getting caught. First of&nbsp;
all, we need to make sure we understand the limits&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.040
of this book. And before we go on a killing spree,&nbsp;
I would do some heavy experimentation with this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.520
thing. If we filled a fax machine with Death Note&nbsp;
paper, you could kill in public simply by sending&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:44.080
an email without looking suspicious. If I wanted&nbsp;
to fake a death, I might try writing in fading&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:49.440
or erasable ink. These ideas might not work, but&nbsp;
we'll learn what's possible. On his way back home,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.840
this demonic creature appears introducing&nbsp;
himself as a death God who dropped the book.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.480
And he's decided to let him keep it. The creature&nbsp;
explains that only those who touch the Death Note&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.600
can see him in his neither his ally or enemy.
He asks the monster, what its name is and is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:08.800
introduced to his new partner in crime Ryuk.&nbsp;
All right, even though he seems nice enough,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:13.520
we can't assume this guy is on our side. If he's&nbsp;
neutral, then he could ruin our plans or dox us&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:18.080
at any given moment for his own amusement. This&nbsp;
thing is a loose end. You do not want to leave&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:22.400
yourself vulnerable to. Obviously, writing his&nbsp;
name down in the death book is a place to start,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.320
but he probably can't be killed and it would&nbsp;
just piss him off. The best strategy here is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.840
to find out his motives and bribe him. I&nbsp;
would be doing research to find out more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.160
about this creature that might exist in folklore.&nbsp;
Light here doesn't know enough about him yet,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.080
but soon we'll learn more about this death&nbsp;
God that we can take advantage of later.&nbsp;

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:43.040
Light here decides to ramp things up and goes on a&nbsp;
killing spree. No one knows who's committing these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:47.840
murders, but they start calling this vigilante,&nbsp;
Kira, which is the Japanese pronunciation of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.680
killer. Four months later and the police&nbsp;
department came to figure out the connection&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:56.320
between all these dead criminals. They believe a&nbsp;
virus might've killed the victims. But the captain&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.400
here thinks they might have a serial killer on the&nbsp;
loose. He goes to meet with the commissioner and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.960
learns that the brilliant detective L is on the&nbsp;
case. He's analyzed the data and figured out that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:10.560
not only is Kira in Japan, but he's also a single&nbsp;
person killing people through unnatural means.&nbsp;

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:15.440
Okay. Light is going on a bender here and it's&nbsp;
not the smartest move. The pattern has already&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:20.160
emerged and it's getting way too much attention.&nbsp;
But this has a solution because the third rule of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.560
the Death Note is if the cause of death is written&nbsp;
within 40 seconds of writing the person's name,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:29.360
it will happen. A sharp increase in heart attacks&nbsp;
among a healthy population we'll show a pattern.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.960
So we need things to be as random as&nbsp;
possible with no pattern behind it.&nbsp;

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:37.840
The best way to do this is with dice. I would&nbsp;
compile a list of criminals I wanted to kill and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:42.720
assign each a number. Then assign a death style&nbsp;
to a different number and a time to a different&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:48.080
number. Then a series of dice rules would tell me&nbsp;
who dies, how, and when. This gives us a limitless&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:52.880
combination of deadly possibilities, removing&nbsp;
any pattern to investigate. And they could all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:58.000
be pre-planned days or weeks ahead. Back at&nbsp;
home, Light here is about to meet his match,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.720
and it could break everything. He tunes into an&nbsp;
international broadcast where the detective L&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.840
announces to the world he's been&nbsp;
tasked with helping uncover who Kira,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:11.040
the vigilante is. He describes the killer as&nbsp;
predictable and immature. Taking it personally,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:14.960
Light here writes the detective's name into&nbsp;
his death note and waits for him to die on TV.&nbsp;

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:19.200
But when the man collapses from a heart&nbsp;
attack, the real L reveals he's tricked,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:23.440
Kira. He had a convict, impersonate him&nbsp;
and made it seem like the broadcast was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:28.240
shown internationally when it was actually&nbsp;
restricted to Tokyo. In one big brain move,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:33.920
he's proven that Kira can kill people remotely&nbsp;
and is also living in the Tokyo area. Okay. This&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:38.160
L guy is an intellectual force to be reckoned&nbsp;
with. But there's a way to turn the tables here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:43.440
by turning the government into public enemy number&nbsp;
one. From now on, I'm writing every cause of death&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:48.800
to be either suicide by capital punishment, or&nbsp;
suicide by cop. The death sentence in Japan is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:54.720
still active. And as much as 15 executions happen&nbsp;
each year. This is a chess match of two extremely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:59.360
intelligent people. So using his own agencies&nbsp;
to do your killing for you will force him to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:04.160
retreat and find a different plan to attack.
Back home Light has dinner with his family&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:08.800
and we find out his dad is the police chief in&nbsp;
charge of the Kira investigation. Light offers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:13.120
to help on the case, but the man won't let&nbsp;
his son get involved. Upset, he leaves the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:17.920
table and goes upstairs where he hacks into the&nbsp;
police reports and discovers that detective L&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:22.880
knows he's a student. He'll need to shake things&nbsp;
up to throw them off his scent. Three days later,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:27.040
the police are shocked to find criminals are&nbsp;
dying every hour and on a perfect schedule.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:31.920
L here to deduces that Kira can also manipulate&nbsp;
the times of death. But this change in strategy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:36.960
happened after they discovered he was a student.&nbsp;
So the detective realizes that he has access to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:42.000
the team's information and they might have a mole.&nbsp;
Okay. Light has just confirmed that he can access&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.320
the police department's information and it gives&nbsp;
them an opportunity to take that advantage away.&nbsp;

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:51.120
I would go analog with the entire investigation&nbsp;
and take everything offline, but use the database&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:56.320
as a decoy by planting misinformation to study&nbsp;
how he reacts to it. If we already know that Kira&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:00.800
is a student than, we need to narrow our scope&nbsp;
to a specific school if we want to get closer.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:04.880
We've also seen that Kira lets his emotions&nbsp;
get the better of him when he's under pressure.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:08.960
I would put false information on the police&nbsp;
database that the Dean of Kira school is coming&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:13.840
in to give a testimony in less than an hour. He'll&nbsp;
see the fake report and just might kill the Dean.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:19.120
So whichever Dean is dead by the end of the day&nbsp;
is the school Kira goes to. On his way home,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:23.200
Light suddenly notices that he's being&nbsp;
followed. Somebody is onto him and he needs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:27.440
to find out who this is before they catch him.
The death God asks, how you will get the stalker's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:31.680
name? But he has a plan. And he's going to use&nbsp;
rule number four, to get it. After writing the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:36.320
cause of death, details of the death should be&nbsp;
written in the next six minutes and 40 seconds.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:40.480
The next day he's riding the bus with his&nbsp;
girlfriend and the stalker from yesterday has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:45.840
followed them. This is no accident and Light has&nbsp;
a master plan. At the next bus stop, a man gets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:50.240
in and puts a gun into the driver's head. Light&nbsp;
tells the stalker that he'll stop the criminal,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:54.880
but the man tells him not to risk it revealing&nbsp;
he's an FBI agent and gets them to back down.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:58.240
Light here, drops a piece of paper on&nbsp;
the floor and the Hijacker picks it up.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:02.240
And after reading it, pointed his gun at him.&nbsp;
But is shocked when he sees Ryuk standing in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:06.640
front of him. He tries shooting the monster but&nbsp;
the bullets go straight through. Freaking out,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:10.880
the man urge of the driver to stop. And he gets&nbsp;
off the bus only going to get hit by a car.&nbsp;

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:15.520
This whole thing was an elaborate setup to learn&nbsp;
more about this FBI agent using four number four&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:20.960
to make the criminal hijack the bus and get him&nbsp;
killed. Okay, this changes everything. If we can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:25.680
use this Death Note to control people's actions,&nbsp;
I'm using this to get rich or die trying. We could&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:29.920
use this on a billionaire, making them write&nbsp;
us into their will for a full inheritance just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:33.920
before they die. Let's be honest. If you're going&nbsp;
to kill people, you might as well take their money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:38.640
while you're at it. Back home, Light thinks that&nbsp;
L sent the FBI agent after him, and there might&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:43.360
be more than one. He knows he can't kill the agent&nbsp;
stalking him as he'll be the prime suspect. But if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:48.160
all agents were to die, then he would be safe.
Ryuk is surprised at Light's blood lust&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:53.760
and starts to look concerned. There's a lot more&nbsp;
to this death God than meets the eye. Okay. This&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:59.040
is interesting. Ryuk should be happy here because&nbsp;
as we learned, every death will extend his life.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:03.600
Clearly, we don't know everything about this guy&nbsp;
and if he's keeping secrets from us, we need to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:09.200
find some leverage over him to make sure he won't&nbsp;
screw us over. Now we saw on the bus that physical&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:14.080
injuries cannot hurt this creature. So killing him&nbsp;
is out of the question, but blackmail and bribery&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:18.400
might still be on the table. Threatening to&nbsp;
destroy this book might get us answers he doesn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:22.400
want to give. So we might be able to use this&nbsp;
to get him to do our bidding. We just have to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:28.080
careful not to piss him off. The next day, the FBI&nbsp;
agent leaves his hotel and heads to the subway.&nbsp;

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:32.480
He's followed by his fiance, Naomi here, and&nbsp;
doesn't know that she's on the train watching&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:37.360
him. He takes a folder left on a rack and finds a&nbsp;
message from Kira who knows him by name and wants&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:41.760
to talk with him through this transmitter. With&nbsp;
little choice, he activates the walkie talkie and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:46.800
listens. Light demonstrates he's the real Kira by&nbsp;
having the man next to the agent, die from a heart&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:51.760
attack. He then asks him how many other agents&nbsp;
are in Japan. And he's told there are 11 others,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:56.000
but he doesn't know their names. Light then&nbsp;
asks the agent to his leader's name inside&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.720
this box on the first page. He's fallen for&nbsp;
the fifth rule. Even if you do not actually&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:06.000
possess the Death Note, anyone can use it if you&nbsp;
can recognize the person and his or her name.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.960
After writing, it he's told to access his computer&nbsp;
as he'll receive all 12 IDs from his boss.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:16.000
He's then instructed, write their names in the&nbsp;
remaining boxes. This was Light's brilliant plan.&nbsp;

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.480
He tricked the agent into writing everyone's name&nbsp;
on a page of the Death Note. And with it, he just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:25.600
sent the death sentences of all the other agents&nbsp;
as the all start dropping dead. When gets off at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:29.920
the next station, he collapses from a heart attack&nbsp;
and looks back to see Light standing in front of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:34.800
him. The agent's fiance rushes to save him, but&nbsp;
it's too late. As Light's train pulls out of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:40.480
station. He's won for now, but he's just created&nbsp;
another enemy and she will be much harder to beat.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:45.600
Okay. That was a genius way to extract the&nbsp;
information, but he also made some mistakes here.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:50.080
First of all, going on the train was a terrible&nbsp;
idea because now they will be scraping through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:54.640
the security footage of the incident. And this&nbsp;
hooded figure would be a prime suspect. You could&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:59.360
easily be tracked back to your home and caught.
Now, if the agent is already being manipulated,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:03.280
there's no purpose to meet him on the train. I&nbsp;
would've brought him to a much more controlled&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:07.840
and isolated environment away from the public to&nbsp;
make sure there were no cameras and nobody was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:12.800
following it. Personally, I wouldn't be killing&nbsp;
FBI agents at all. Because it keeps revealing that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:17.200
you have insider information. This narrows down&nbsp;
the suspects to people with connections to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:21.040
police. And if your father is the leader of the&nbsp;
investigation, then you will stay on the suspect&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:25.920
list no matter what. The best way to throw out the&nbsp;
stalker and mislead the FBI investigation without&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:30.480
killing them, is to set up a false confession.&nbsp;
I would make two criminals march into the police&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:35.360
station and one of them declares that he is Kira.
When they ask for proof, the second criminal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:39.120
will have a heart attack, making it look like&nbsp;
the first criminal killed them with his mind.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:43.200
Then write in the Death Note that he cannot speak,&nbsp;
eat, or drink water when he's detained by the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:48.080
police until he dies. It's an elaborate con that&nbsp;
could go wrong. But at the very least, it buys&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:52.880
us time to plan further ahead and cover our tracks&nbsp;
without being followed. Later that day, the police&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:57.520
chief announces to his investigation team that&nbsp;
Kira is now killing people who aren't criminals&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:01.680
and gives them the option to quit. Knowing&nbsp;
how dangerous this has gotten, almost every&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:05.920
single member leaves until only six are left.
The police expressed their frustration for the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:10.560
detective and demand he shows his face if he&nbsp;
wishes to continue working the case. Accepting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:15.280
their demand, the liaison takes the investigation&nbsp;
team to a hotel where they meet the detective in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:19.600
person. And he is not who they expected. They&nbsp;
all introduce themselves by name and he chews&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:24.560
them out for it. If he was Kira, he would have all&nbsp;
their names and they'd all be dead. They've been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:29.200
on the losing end of this battle, but L has a new&nbsp;
strategy that he thinks can stop Kira for good.&nbsp;

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.200
Okay. This guy's a strange dude, but there's&nbsp;
one detail here that tells me Kira is screwed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:39.920
This guy only eats candy. And at first glance,&nbsp;
this looks like a weakness, but it's not.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:45.280
L here is using a high caloric intake diet to stay&nbsp;
awake and alert for as many hours as possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:50.000
The brain uses the most calories in the body.&nbsp;
Where even a stoic professional chess match can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.320
burn the same amount of calories as running&nbsp;
a marathon. Crab fishermen also do this when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:57.920
they have only a three-day window to hunt&nbsp;
for crap, and they need to stay awake as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:02.640
long as possible to maximize their time.
L is looking for an advantage even in his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:06.800
diet. And it tells me he's thinking on&nbsp;
more levels than Kira is at the moment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:12.000
to ensure he doesn't miss any opportunity to&nbsp;
catch this killer. Later, the dead agent's fiance,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.880
Naomi has taken matters into her own hands. She&nbsp;
finds information on the bus hijacking from the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:21.360
newspaper and meets the driver who mentions&nbsp;
that her fiance was seen arguing with a young&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:26.480
man but he disappeared before the police arrived.&nbsp;
Meanwhile, L watches the surveillance tapes of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:31.840
agent's death and finds an important detail in the&nbsp;
footage. With one glance, he's figured it all out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:35.920
He informed the team that he's narrowed down the&nbsp;
list of suspects to the families in the police&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:41.040
department, including the police chief's son,&nbsp;
Light. He knows that the FBI agent was tracking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:45.840
Light and knows the agent's wife used to be part&nbsp;
of the FBI. And since she followed him, she must&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:51.040
have felt there was something suspicious going on.
Suspecting Kira was on the subway, L arranges to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:55.200
plant cameras in the police chief's home&nbsp;
and keep watch over Light for seven days.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.720
Now this is all well and good, but it's also&nbsp;
completely unnecessary because Japan has a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:04.720
stop and frisk policy. They're super polite&nbsp;
about it. But if this kid has proven he can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:09.040
kill someone at any given hour of the day, then&nbsp;
it's either done in his mind or done through an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:13.440
object on his person. If he's frisked, he will&nbsp;
either run away, which lets you arrest him. Or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:18.160
they would find the book. This solution takes&nbsp;
no resources other than a well-placed beat cop.&nbsp;

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:22.720
The next day at college, Light here is greeted by&nbsp;
his girlfriend and the woman he saw at the subway.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:27.280
She gives him a business card and admits she's&nbsp;
the fiancee of the agent that was killed. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:31.680
thinks Light here killed him. He denies the&nbsp;
accusation and his girlfriend backs him up.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:35.920
Light here takes out a piece of paper from the&nbsp;
Death Note and writes down the woman's name on it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:40.320
but nothing happens to her. The woman warns him&nbsp;
that he can't kill her because she gave him a fake&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:45.040
name. Okay, this woman is dangerous. Her&nbsp;
fiance has been killed. And she has nothing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:49.120
left to live for. Desperate people who want&nbsp;
vengeance are the kinds of people who will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:53.040
burn the whole place down just to prove a&nbsp;
point. And that makes for a very dangerous,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:57.200
loose end that we need to deal with the right way.
The only way out of this is to satisfy her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:00.400
bloodlust. I would find a criminal&nbsp;
to manipulate, to tell her he is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:04.400
Kira. Then the cause of death is that the&nbsp;
manipulated criminal gets shot by the woman&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:09.200
and killed. This gives enough emotional trauma&nbsp;
for her to believe that she's gotten vengeance&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:15.040
for her fiance's death by killing the man herself.
Later that day, Light returns home and discovers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:19.520
that his room has been broken into. Earlier, he&nbsp;
placed pencil lead in the hinge of his door and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:23.680
it's now broken. Now Light knows he's under&nbsp;
surveillance and can't do anything with the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:28.000
Death Note or Ryuk until he tricks them. The&nbsp;
police chief has told Light will be left alone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.400
if his son does nothing suspicious and there are&nbsp;
still more deaths. The college student's still&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:37.280
isn't cleared of being a murderer just yet.&nbsp;
Okay. This looks like Light here is cornered,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:41.520
but they've played right into his hands. First&nbsp;
of all, you can't build a case on this because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:45.280
you can't prove a negative. If no deaths&nbsp;
happened during his surveillance, that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:49.760
circumstantial evidence at best. And it isn't&nbsp;
enough to arrest him or even take him to court.&nbsp;

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:54.240
This is a fool's errand. But there's another&nbsp;
massive oversight here. L should've considered&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:58.160
that this kid is a law student, whose father&nbsp;
is the chief of police. And he should know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:03.680
that according to Japanese law, under article&nbsp;
23 of the 1999 act for wiretapping and criminal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:08.640
investigation, the suspect must be notified&nbsp;
by the police. If they don't under article 30,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:13.120
Light can legally Sue them for breaking the law.&nbsp;
And they'll be forced to leave him alone. He had&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:18.480
a great opportunity here to sabotage their whole&nbsp;
operation and he didn't take it. By day seven, the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:22.720
surveillance team is still observing the college&nbsp;
student, but when breaking news about an arrested&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:27.360
child murderer is reported, they realize Light&nbsp;
isn't even watching. Moments after, the murderer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:31.760
dies of a heart attack while in custody and Light&nbsp;
hasn't moved a muscle. They're convinced it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:36.880
not him, but Light has tricked them all. Because&nbsp;
inside his chip bag is a miniature TV playing the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:41.680
news and a piece of paper from the Death Note.
With the college student cleared of suspicion,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:46.720
L receives a call from the FBI agent's fiance&nbsp;
who claims she will risk her own life to prove&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:50.640
that Light is Kira. And the first part of her&nbsp;
plan is to make his girlfriend call him to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:54.400
meet at the art gallery. The surveillance&nbsp;
team watches through the cameras as Light&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:58.320
enters the building. He sees the woman holding&nbsp;
his girlfriend hostage and is told to confess&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:02.960
that he is Kira. He begs the woman to let her&nbsp;
go and insist that he's not Kira. But the woman&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:07.840
reveals her real name and dares him to kill her.
He slowly pulls out a pen to write her name down,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:12.320
but stops when he hears police sirens in the&nbsp;
distance. His girlfriend breaks free and runs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:17.120
to him, but get shot. The woman is horrified&nbsp;
by her mistake and kills herself out of guilt.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:21.440
Light mourns his girlfriend's death and puts on&nbsp;
a good show. But it turns out this was his plan&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:26.320
all along. At the subway, he noticed her folder&nbsp;
had a cross on it and he traced it to the church&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:30.400
where she was getting married. He found her name&nbsp;
in the records and wrote down in the Death Note,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:34.240
that she will lure Kira to the museum&nbsp;
and kill herself trying to catch him.&nbsp;

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:38.880
He then wrote that his girlfriend would be shot&nbsp;
to death without specifying by whom. Since the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:43.680
woman was the only one in the room with a gun,&nbsp;
the Death Note caused her to kill his girlfriend.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:47.840
When his father comes to take him home, he asks&nbsp;
if he can join the Kira investigation so that he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:52.640
could get revenge on Kira. That's when L appears&nbsp;
in approved his membership. These two masterminds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:57.520
are just getting warmed up. But they both don't&nbsp;
realize a new player is about to join the game.&nbsp;

00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:02.000
In another part of the city, a famous young woman&nbsp;
is being followed by her delusional stalker who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.160
wants to kill her. She's cornered with no one&nbsp;
to help, but the man suddenly collapses from a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:10.640
heart attack and a Death Note falls right next&nbsp;
to him. There's more than one book. And things&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:15.600
are about to get way more interesting. But what&nbsp;
do you think? How would you be Death Note? Let&nbsp;&nbsp;
