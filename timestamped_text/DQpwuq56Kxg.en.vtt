00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.440
in this video we will deal with the issues of&nbsp;
being an Ajin we will attempt to beat the threats&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:17.520
which include other Ajin and humans this guy&nbsp;
is Nagai he's an Ajin like you and me the first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.280
time he realized he wasn't human was when he was&nbsp;
killed by a truck but woke up again immediately&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:27.280
oh and by the way there are 46 known&nbsp;
Ajin in this world at this moment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:32.720
so what happens when you are identified as&nbsp;
an Ajin well something like this right here

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.000
Nagai has been inside this underground left for&nbsp;
multiple months at this point they amputated his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.040
limbs shot bullets into his head and many more&nbsp;
terrible things while he was at full conscious&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:55.440
and alive if you are an ajin you do not want to be&nbsp;
known as one Nagai is literally mummified in this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.120
position you have no space whatsoever from what&nbsp;
i've heard those __ don't even let you sleep they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:06.560
just kill you over and over and over again day and&nbsp;
night with no end in sight you are a guinea pig&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.440
material just an experiment once you are in&nbsp;
the same position like Nagai here there is no&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.960
chance to escape in this situation the only hope&nbsp;
you have is to either be freed by someone else&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.760
get released voluntarily or be able to draw&nbsp;
an advantage if they were to make a mistake&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.400
now you see that's all quite heavy speculation&nbsp;
so as an Ajin you do not want to be known as one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:34.800
to anyone the issue is most Ajin don't know&nbsp;
that they are in fact argents until they die&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:40.320
and since most unexpected deaths are caused by&nbsp;
external influences in humans it is very likely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:46.080
that once you find out that you are one the people&nbsp;
around you will know that just as quick as you do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.520
and then the age of smartphones is pretty bad&nbsp;
luck for us the only chance you have to escape&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.560
this madness would be to escape as soon as you&nbsp;
have realized that you are an Ajin until the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:02.080
special forces arrive to take you hostage you&nbsp;
have time to disappear and when i say disappear&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:08.080
i mean disappear go full hermit mode is the only&nbsp;
chance you have hiding at friends and family&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.840
members places is probably a bad idea since those&nbsp;
would be screened first and put under surveillance&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.680
initially it seems you are on your own&nbsp;
so there are multiple options you have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.160
either you decide to stay in your country&nbsp;
and go into hiding there or you leave it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.880
the biggest problem with leaving the country&nbsp;
is that you are probably caught while doing so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.600
and leaving the country illegally via land border&nbsp;
would cause you a lot of problems just as soon as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.800
you're screened by a random police control in the&nbsp;
new country considering all of this the best way&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:43.120
you have would be to get a new identity full-on&nbsp;
new passport new name new hairstyle and clothing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:49.360
etc even if you decide to stay in your own country&nbsp;
your goal should be a new identity without that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.960
you won't be free until you die besides Nagai&nbsp;
and us there are other Ajins you can guess their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:00.160
temperament all of them were most likely treated&nbsp;
just like Nagai i heard some of them for 20 years&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:06.480
without a break Ajin or not going through this&nbsp;
will [ __ ] your mental landscape this is Sato

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:17.360
Mr. Sato can be your best friend or your&nbsp;
worst enemy it really depends on you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.560
when he knew that another Ajin was held captive&nbsp;
and experimented on he decided to free him he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:28.000
and his team break into this underground lab shoot&nbsp;
down everyone in reach and attempt to free Nagai&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.560
that's gotta be one lucky day in his life&nbsp;
after the interaction between Sato and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.760
head of this lab Mr. Tosaki it is pretty&nbsp;
clear that he was also held captive there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:43.200
in that case this rescue act is motivated&nbsp;
by vengeance more so than compassion Nagai&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:49.200
refuses to join Sato in fact he literally opposes&nbsp;
him and saves those that tortured him instead&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.800
let me give you a quick rundown of Ajin attributes&nbsp;
the most important thing about Ajins is their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:00.720
immortality to this day there is no identified&nbsp;
way on how to kill one another key component of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:06.560
being an Ajin is that once you are killed you will&nbsp;
regenerate completely fractures and cut off limbs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:12.400
no problem they will all reappear quickly so when&nbsp;
an Ajin is being immobilized the best thing to do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:19.440
for him is to kill himself which we call a reset&nbsp;
the last and possibly most curious aspect of ajins&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.880
are their ghosts not much is known about them but&nbsp;
they are invisible to humans to us they look like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:31.200
composed ash or black matter they're also called&nbsp;
IBM they are extremely strong and fast and possess&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:36.240
individual skills on top of that the only way to&nbsp;
beat the ghost is to fight it with your own one

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:46.400
Nagai escapes Sato's grip and the underground lab&nbsp;
too escape is your only option here but where do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:51.680
you go before we analyze Nagai's situation let's&nbsp;
look at Sato's next move so you can understand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:57.520
the plot as well Sato takes advantage in front of&nbsp;
the lab and scores a live interview with various&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:03.760
news outlets the guy sitting in the wheelchair is&nbsp;
Tanaka he was Ajin subject number two until he was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:10.320
freed by Sato two years ago he has a point here&nbsp;
what was stunned to them can't be justified Ajin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:14.720
should be able to play a part in society&nbsp;
without being alienated or even worse&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:19.040
experimented on Nagai stumbles out of&nbsp;
the forest through which he had escaped&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:23.680
it should be considered that the immediate area&nbsp;
around the lab will be screened to find him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:29.200
so staying there is a bad idea but he gets taken&nbsp;
in by an old lady that provides him with shelter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:34.800
and food for the time being it seems like she&nbsp;
knows that he is an agent but doesn't seem to care&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:40.800
staying at her house is only a temporary solution&nbsp;
it is likely that officials will patrol this area&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:45.200
but if this old lady has the means to hide&nbsp;
him and is willing to lie to the officials&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:50.080
then this place could become an important&nbsp;
asset but Nagai commits a few mistakes here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:55.120
for instance he leaves the house without taking&nbsp;
any measurements to conceal his true identity&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.960
apart from wearing a cap of course&nbsp;
but in my opinion this is not enough&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:04.720
here's what i would do this old lady seems to be&nbsp;
an ally she doesn't seem to have any interest in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:09.760
blowing up my cover i would stay in there and&nbsp;
not leave the house under any circumstances&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:14.800
what i need is access to a black market so i&nbsp;
can purchase a new identity for that i either&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:20.240
gain access to the dark web or i need to leave my&nbsp;
hideout and find someone who can help me directly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:25.200
changing your look is easy your demeanor difficult&nbsp;
if you struggle with staying calm you shouldn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:30.160
hesitate to acquire some benzos every time you&nbsp;
leave the house you pop one or two and you should&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:35.680
be as calm as a meditating kung fu master on&nbsp;
a Chinese mountain Nagai visits his sister and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:41.040
brings her back to the old lady's house i like the&nbsp;
idea behind it they seem to be getting along well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:47.040
and she seems to be the only family member that&nbsp;
he has it's beautiful but a little risky if i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:52.000
were any of the bad guys putting his sister under&nbsp;
surveillance would have been the first thing i did&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.360
after his breakout in our case here none of that&nbsp;
happens both of them make it to the old lady's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:02.720
house safely and say they're together for the&nbsp;
time being the risks involved by picking her up or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:08.880
clear but after hearing the facts it's completely&nbsp;
justified because it turns out that she's ill&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:13.120
also having a crazy person like Sato out&nbsp;
there you don't really want to keep your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:18.400
sister out of your sight all in all i think&nbsp;
this was a good decision bingeXpress approves

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:28.560
while you're trying to get your new identity&nbsp;
to escape the country and restart somewhere new&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:33.760
you should train being an Ajin comes with a&nbsp;
lot of new powers that is useless if you don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:38.960
know how to use them the ghost of an agent&nbsp;
resembles the core personality of the host&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:45.120
that is why Nagai's ghost seems to be a little&nbsp;
well let's call it anti-social in any way&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:50.560
you would want to know exactly how your powers&nbsp;
work and manifest for instance how long can you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:56.560
manifest your ghost at this point you are still&nbsp;
trapped and searched by an army of mad scientists&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:00.880
and a small army of demi-humans both want&nbsp;
you and they are not interested in having&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:05.920
tea and biscuits with you if worse comes&nbsp;
to worst you must be prepared to fight&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:10.880
meanwhile Sato has started another attack to&nbsp;
support his cause the government has waited too&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:14.720
long in coming forward with his requests&nbsp;
and this is the price they have to pay

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:24.480
He hijacked a plane and flew it into this&nbsp;
government building being in Ajin he really&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:28.960
didn't have anything to worry about his&nbsp;
comrade flies in a care package via drone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:34.000
back in the days of modern warfare 2 i think&nbsp;
they still use small helicopters for that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.120
times change Jesus the special forces have&nbsp;
prepared well for this scenario though as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:44.880
soon as Sato appears he gets shot down every time&nbsp;
he is about to regenerate he gets shut down again&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:51.120
before he can manifest that's a very effective way&nbsp;
to immobilize Ajin but Sato wouldn't be Sato if he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:56.960
didn't calculate that too Tanaka is positioned on&nbsp;
a rooftop nearby as soon as Sato gets cornered he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:01.760
intervenes by taking out one swat member at a&nbsp;
time intercepting the structure of the ground&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:08.400
forces it causes so much chaos that Sato has&nbsp;
enough time to manifest and well it's showdown

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:18.080
i would like to make a quick side note on how&nbsp;
the special forces could have avoided this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:22.800
when they came up with their plan they did not&nbsp;
consider that Sato is possibly aware of that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:28.560
weakness too preventing an Ajin from healing&nbsp;
i mean first of all Sato is an Ajin veteran he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:33.920
has shown his capabilities more than once it&nbsp;
is very clear that he is the real OG when we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:39.520
talk about Ajin so underestimating him is a death&nbsp;
sentence on its own Sato's attack was announced&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:44.720
days ahead it would have been easy to prepare&nbsp;
additional tactics to prevent any interference&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:48.560
scouting all nearby rooftops would&nbsp;
have been an easy challenge to solve&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:53.200
if the special forces had snipers to support&nbsp;
the ground team this would have never happened&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:58.400
also knowing that you are going to fight an&nbsp;
Ajin you want to have multiple layers of attack&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:03.840
where was the air support the evacuation of&nbsp;
the citizens around backup teams and so forth

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:12.240
At the same time Nagai and his sister&nbsp;
were detected by citizen they had to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:17.360
escape their hideout if they were more careful&nbsp;
with their privacy this could have been avoided&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:23.040
at this point the walls are closing in the&nbsp;
public gets increasingly hostile towards Ajin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:29.040
this is the last moment you have to make a lasting&nbsp;
decision what would you do disappear for good or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:34.400
enter the fight i would utilize my goals to get&nbsp;
a lot of money quickly because if you get a lot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:40.480
of money quickly you can get far away quickly&nbsp;
money buys you everything identities security&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:46.240
comfort just about all you need at this moment and&nbsp;
having a ghost that is literally an invisible ally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:52.560
that you control i don't see the problem here one&nbsp;
thing is clear your sister is exposed and mortal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:58.960
so whatever you do she must be your first priority&nbsp;
Nagai makes the third best decision instead of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:04.720
robbing a bank and buying two first-class tickets&nbsp;
to the cook islands he teams up with Mr. Tosaki i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:11.360
guess it's once again if you can't beat him join&nbsp;
him as long as Mr. Sato and his fellas are around&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:16.320
Nagai and his sister aren't safe perhaps not&nbsp;
even on a pacific island teaming up with a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:22.320
former enemy is risky as an Ajin you're definitely&nbsp;
stronger but as we have seen in Mr. Sato's case&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:28.240
an Ajin can be fought with great precision what do&nbsp;
you do in case they capture you after Sato's death&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:33.600
and what do you do in case each one of your new&nbsp;
allies is killed what about your sister there are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:39.760
so many questions you better try to answer first&nbsp;
so what we do need at this point are backup plans&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:45.120
here's a tip when you meet with the government&nbsp;
to discuss the strategy take note of each member&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:50.160
who are they what are their names in this position&nbsp;
it shouldn't be a big challenge to figure out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:54.800
keep this information somewhere safe if this&nbsp;
government tries to screw you over you have the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:54.800 --> 00:12:00.480
means to counter attack by taking any of them or&nbsp;
their family members hostage trust is important&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:06.240
but security much better don't forget that you are&nbsp;
completely on your own if they try to backstab you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:11.200
there is no one left who would free you since it&nbsp;
was Sato that ventured out to free you if you end&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:16.480
up as an experiment again it might be for much&nbsp;
longer than just 20 years therefore you would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:21.600
do well to have an ace up your sleeve another&nbsp;
important thing to make sure is who will take&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:26.400
care of your sister in case of your death as an&nbsp;
immortal soldier you're in a pretty good spot to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:31.600
make good deals i wouldn't agree to anything less&nbsp;
than a few million dollars in a lifetime security&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:37.360
for her mr Sato's plan is to steal a poisonous&nbsp;
gas bomb the gas was developed through experiments&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:43.520
performed on himself call me sick but i sympathize&nbsp;
more with Mr. Sato than with the humans the sheer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:49.760
agony he had to go through for 20 years it just&nbsp;
leaves you speechless they created a monster and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:55.040
now they have to deal with it i guess that's how&nbsp;
it goes the bomb he wants to steal is located in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:55.040 --> 00:13:00.480
a secure building on a 49th floor if Sato and&nbsp;
his team want it they have to come and get it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:05.920
it is always better to defend than attack if you&nbsp;
defend you're likely to know the area perfectly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:11.680
and so setting up traps is easy especially when&nbsp;
you know what the enemy is coming for Sato's team&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:16.080
enters the building like Neo and trinity in a&nbsp;
second matrix movie one of them has already hacked&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:21.520
the network to send out decoy signals so the squad&nbsp;
can move forward quickly when they proceed they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:26.160
end up in a battle with a surprise in it they&nbsp;
sure seem to be enjoying themselves they kind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:31.280
of remind me of my San Andreas times after having&nbsp;
used the infinite health cheat a lot of fun for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:37.280
the first 30 minutes but just boring thereafter i&nbsp;
wonder how they feel but i guess it's real life so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:41.760
it probably takes a bit longer than 30 minutes&nbsp;
to get bored Nagai hid in this room pretending&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:46.800
to be dead when all of them moved forward he&nbsp;
manifested again and sent out his ghost after&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:53.200
having realized Mr. Sato isn't there now this is&nbsp;
where stuff gets interesting the trap Nagai and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:58.240
his team have prepared is pretty slick and outside&nbsp;
the box thinking when Tanaka and his team arrive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:04.160
at a targeted location Nagai positions himself&nbsp;
in front of the ventilator system he releases&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:08.240
his black metal particles and the ventilator&nbsp;
transports them into the room where Tanaka&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:14.000
and his team are located completely obstructing&nbsp;
their view invisible black matter also called IBM&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:20.080
particles or as the name suggests invisible to non&nbsp;
Ajin to Ajin well it looks like this right here

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:28.560
While they're completely blinded Nagai's team&nbsp;
has no problem shooting them down with multiple&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:33.840
narcotics at once i think this plan is pretty&nbsp;
well thought through however i would have done&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:39.760
it slightly different using Nagai's IBM particles&nbsp;
to obstruct their view is genius but having men&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:44.080
stationed there to shoot them down with&nbsp;
narcotics is not the best way to go&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:48.560
the best way would have been to close&nbsp;
them in and alongside Nagai's IBM&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:53.840
spread sleeping gas too this would have done&nbsp;
the job without risking the lives of mortal men&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:58.240
Mr. Sato is visiting a pellets factory no i&nbsp;
don't think he's looking for a new business&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:04.000
mentor option but instead he well he he&nbsp;
had a plan well have a look for yourself

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:18.480
What is worse than facing john wick immortal&nbsp;
John Wick of course yes this was possibly the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:23.520
best scene in this movie hands down but if you&nbsp;
do consider the plot closely you will find a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:29.440
hole here so Mr. Sato used the Ajin attribute to&nbsp;
regenerate from the biggest piece of flesh left&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:34.160
after his death but how in the world did&nbsp;
nobody from the government consider that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:39.600
possibility if the government experimented&nbsp;
on several Ajin bodies for combined decades&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:44.480
there is no way they didn't know how Ajin&nbsp;
manifestation works it's hard to believe that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:50.480
such a basic Ajin skill was overlooked had they&nbsp;
flooded the room with sleeping gas agent this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:56.400
would have been prevented but in all honesty i&nbsp;
didn't mind seeing Bruce Wick in action that was a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:56.400 --> 00:16:02.240
that was a nice treat in the following scene&nbsp;
Mr. Sato and Tanaka are able to capture the bomb&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:05.760
how come this bomb is still in this&nbsp;
building it doesn't make much sense&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:09.520
if i knew that an attack is being planned to&nbsp;
capture something in my possession i wouldn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:14.960
hesitate to relocate that item Nagai and his&nbsp;
team focus way too much on capturing the enemy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:20.160
instead of also focusing on keeping that bomb out&nbsp;
of their hands the tables are turned if we want to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:25.520
win this battle we need to attack Mr. Sato could&nbsp;
have easily escaped with the bomb and started the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:30.720
attack on Tokyo a few days later but he stayed&nbsp;
back proving that he doesn't really care about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:37.360
Ajin acceptance within society all he wants is&nbsp;
his revenge and again i completely understand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:42.400
here we are again how do we kill something&nbsp;
that can't be killed knowing that Ajin manifest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:47.360
themselves back from the biggest remaining piece&nbsp;
of flesh one might cut off a limb throw it into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:52.080
a pool of cement and put the remaining body&nbsp;
through a wood shredder just like Mr. Sato did&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:57.920
before if you can't beat something completely&nbsp;
just do what you can in the end Mr. Sato was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:02.720
frozen with liquid nitrogen and shot into a&nbsp;
thousand pieces that's one way to finish the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:09.200
job i guess Nagai on the other hand cut off his&nbsp;
hand beforehand so according to Ajin law he will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:17.840
be back in a quick second if you had to fight an&nbsp;
Ajin being human or not how would you proceed?
