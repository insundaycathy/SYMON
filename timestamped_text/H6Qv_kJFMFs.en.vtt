well I've seen the trailer and I know
he's<00:09:22.360><c> not</c><00:09:22.540><c> but</c><00:09:23.170><c> there's</c><00:09:23.500><c> also</c><00:09:23.830><c> a</c><00:09:24.160><c> clue</c><00:09:24.640><c> in</c><00:09:24.880><c> the</c>

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:24.970 align:start position:0%
he's not but there's also a clue in the
 

00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:27.420 align:start position:0%
he's not but there's also a clue in the
intro<00:09:25.360><c> I</c><00:09:25.390><c> think</c><00:09:25.690><c> in</c><00:09:25.960><c> that</c><00:09:26.470><c> we</c><00:09:26.620><c> can</c><00:09:26.800><c> see</c><00:09:27.040><c> a</c><00:09:27.070><c> body</c>

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:27.430 align:start position:0%
intro I think in that we can see a body
 

00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:29.670 align:start position:0%
intro I think in that we can see a body
sliding<00:09:27.970><c> out</c><00:09:28.090><c> of</c><00:09:28.120><c> a</c><00:09:28.300><c> drawer</c><00:09:28.570><c> and</c><00:09:29.020><c> I</c><00:09:29.260><c> think</c><00:09:29.530><c> this</c>

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:29.680 align:start position:0%
sliding out of a drawer and I think this
 

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:31.770 align:start position:0%
sliding out of a drawer and I think this
symbolises<00:09:30.370><c> him</c><00:09:30.520><c> waking</c><00:09:30.760><c> up</c><00:09:31.060><c> now</c><00:09:31.480><c> when</c><00:09:31.630><c> this</c>

00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:31.780 align:start position:0%
symbolises him waking up now when this
 

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:33.720 align:start position:0%
symbolises him waking up now when this
will<00:09:31.960><c> happen</c><00:09:31.990><c> we</c><00:09:32.530><c> don't</c><00:09:32.770><c> offer</c><00:09:32.950><c> definite</c><00:09:33.430><c> but</c>

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:33.730 align:start position:0%
will happen we don't offer definite but
 

00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:36.780 align:start position:0%
will happen we don't offer definite but
he<00:09:34.120><c> will</c><00:09:34.360><c> eventually</c><00:09:34.810><c> get</c><00:09:35.200><c> out</c><00:09:35.260><c> and</c><00:09:35.680><c> thus</c><00:09:36.310><c> the</c>

00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:36.790 align:start position:0%
he will eventually get out and thus the
 

00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:38.160 align:start position:0%
he will eventually get out and thus the
secret<00:09:37.390><c> will</c><00:09:37.630><c> too</c>

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:38.170 align:start position:0%
secret will too
 

00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:40.380 align:start position:0%
secret will too
you<00:09:38.650><c> just</c><00:09:38.860><c> can't</c><00:09:39.250><c> put</c><00:09:39.490><c> all</c><00:09:39.610><c> your</c><00:09:39.790><c> problems</c><00:09:40.030><c> in</c>

00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:40.390 align:start position:0%
you just can't put all your problems in
 

00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:43.170 align:start position:0%
you just can't put all your problems in
a<00:09:40.480><c> drawer</c><00:09:40.780><c> and</c><00:09:41.080><c> lock</c><00:09:41.350><c> them</c><00:09:41.620><c> away</c><00:09:41.860><c> Melanie</c><00:09:42.340><c> but</c>

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:45.690 align:start position:0%
a drawer and lock them away Melanie but
I<00:09:43.450><c> can</c><00:09:43.720><c> see</c><00:09:43.960><c> the</c><00:09:44.110><c> strategy</c><00:09:44.350><c> behind</c><00:09:44.680><c> it</c><00:09:45.010><c> she</c>

00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:45.700 align:start position:0%
I can see the strategy behind it she
 

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:47.820 align:start position:0%
I can see the strategy behind it she
could<00:09:45.880><c> just</c><00:09:46.090><c> tell</c><00:09:46.270><c> those</c><00:09:46.450><c> in</c><00:09:46.660><c> first</c><00:09:46.960><c> second</c>

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:47.830 align:start position:0%
could just tell those in first second
 

00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:49.710 align:start position:0%
could just tell those in first second

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:51.490 align:start position:0%
the tail and she could also tell a tale
 

00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:53.400 align:start position:0%
the tail and she could also tell a tale
that<00:09:51.760><c> he'd</c><00:09:52.030><c> just</c><00:09:52.060><c> ended</c><00:09:52.540><c> up</c><00:09:52.630><c> living</c><00:09:52.840><c> in</c><00:09:53.110><c> third</c>

that he'd just ended up living in third
 

00:09:53.410 --> 00:09:55.410 align:start position:0%
that he'd just ended up living in third
however<00:09:54.280><c> she</c><00:09:54.520><c> doesn't</c><00:09:54.700><c> know</c><00:09:54.910><c> that</c><00:09:54.940><c> the</c><00:09:55.180><c> tail</c>

00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:55.420 align:start position:0%

however she doesn't know that the tail
know<00:09:55.960><c> about</c><00:09:56.440><c> what's</c><00:09:56.650><c> going</c><00:09:57.010><c> on</c><00:09:57.160><c> and</c><00:09:57.420><c> so</c><00:09:58.420><c> I</c>

00:09:58.440 --> 00:09:58.450 align:start position:0%
know about what's going on and so I
 

00:09:58.450 --> 00:10:00.330 align:start position:0%
