00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:05.480
Welcome back for another 5 minute movie recap.

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:10.160
Today, I'm going to give you an overview of
the 2008 American horror film called 'The

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:11.460
Midnight Meat Train'.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.129
The film is based on Clive Barker's 1984 short
story of the same name.

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:19.040
There will be Spoilers ahead, so please proceed
with caution.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:23.090
Leon wants to take photos of the city in a
distinct, gritty manner.

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.300
He's devastated when gallery owner Susan isn't
impressed by his audacity and doesn't give

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.910
him his big break.

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.130
After regaining his confidence, he sets out
into the city's underground system at night,

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:36.379
where he photographs an attack on a lady before
saving her.

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:39.400
He comes upon her the next day, and she has
vanished.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.840
He is intrigued by the tales of similar disappearances,
so he investigates.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.949
He came to believe that a man named Mahogany,
a butcher, was killing victims on the subway

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:49.920
for the last three years.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.969
When Leon attempts to show the police his
photographs, Detective Hadley does not trust

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:54.969
him.

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:59.999
When Leon gets more deeply involved, his girlfriend
Maya becomes disturbed and suspicious.

00:00:59.999 --> 00:01:03.920
In the final metro train of the night, Leon
witnesses a massacre.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.840
There are numerous passengers that the butcher
murders and hooks up to meat hooks.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.150
Leon collapses on the train after a struggle
with Mahogany.

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.610
The unfortunate individual wakes up in a slaughterhouse
the next morning with weird carvings cut into

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:16.970
his chest.

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.991
While Maya and her buddy Jurgis are concerned
about Leon's photographs of Mahogany, they

00:01:20.991 --> 00:01:25.170
arrive at the killer's flat by investigating
Leon's pictures of Mahogany.

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.220
Following his successful break-in, Jurgis
is apprehended, however Maya succeeds in escaping

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.240
with records that document almost a century
of killings on the subway.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.480
The cops find Hadley still doubtful, but she
nevertheless goes to them.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.700
Maya refuses to return the schedules when
Hadley pressures her.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.360
It's at gunpoint that Hadley tells Laury to
meet her at the station at midnight in order

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.020
to find Jurgis.

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.430
With several knives in hand, Leon travels
to a concealed underground entrance in the

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.720
slaughterhouse, where he prepares to face-off
against Gordan.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.590
When Mahogany has completed his nightly slaughter
and has cornered Maya, he boards the train.

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.960
In amongst the swinging human flesh, Leon
faces off against the killer.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.590
Human bodily parts are often damaged, and
are sometimes used as weapons.

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.649
Jurgis is hanged by his genitals on a meat
hook.

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.400
When he is gutted, he dies.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.099
The train finally reaches its last destination,
a massive deserted station packed with decaying

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:19.020
corpses and their skulls.

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.890
Leon and Maya are told to step away from the
meat by the conductor.

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.859
After witnessing the slaughter of the passengers
by giant lizards, the purpose of the derelict

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:31.170
station is revealed: reptile monsters enter
the car and feed on the remains of the dead

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.430
passengers.

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.430
Leon and Maya dash inside the grotto as the
agent chases after them.

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.099
Mahogany, bruised, dares Leon to a fight to
the death.

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:44.239
Mahogany looks over at Leon as he impales
his broken femur through his throat and just

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:47.040
grins before dying, saying, 'Welcome!'

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.049
The conductor instructs Leon to feed the monsters
every night in order to prevent them from

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:53.109
harming people during the day.

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:57.620
He takes up Leon, and with the same unnatural
power he demonstrated while his former colleague,

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.849
the butcher, was still alive, he pulls out
Leon's tongue and consumes it.

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:06.150
As the conductor notices Leon has his eyes
on Maya, who is laying unconscious on a pile

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.219
of bones, he prompts him to react to Maya,
who has just been knocked out.

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:14.420
Leon must witness the surgeon cutting into
Maya's chest to extract her heart.

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.769
According to him, Leon is expected to fill
the role of the murdered butcher once he finishes

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:20.340
off the butcher.

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.370
After handing the train itinerary to the new
butcher, Detective Hadley holds out a ring

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.300
with the group's logo on it for the butcher
to see.

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:31.319
On the midnight train to New York, the killer
exposes himself as Leon.
