Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.110
Today I'm going to show you a science fiction
thriller film called Ex Machina.

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:07.549
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:12.620
Watch out and take careIn a high-tech search
engine company called Blue Book, Caleb Smith

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:14.380
works as a programmer.

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:19.400
He wins a companywide contest for a one-week
visit to their CEO's luxurious home.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.199
Upon receiving the notification, his coworkers
all congratulate him.

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:27.019
He gets to the isolated house on a helicopter,
and the pilot drops him off in the middle

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:28.220
of nowhere.

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.290
The pilot explains to him that he has to follow
the river to get to the building.

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.609
Caleb walks toward the house and is amazed
by how technologically advanced it is.

00:00:36.609 --> 00:00:41.149
A scanner produces a personal keycard for
Nathan that lets him open the door.

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:45.199
Upon entering, glass walls and the elegant
interior of the home welcomes him.

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:47.229
It seems like the house is empty.

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:51.459
He finally meets Nathan Bateman, the CEO and
the brain behind Blue Book.

00:00:51.459 --> 00:00:56.479
They have a small conversation, and then Nathan
proceeds to give Caleb a tour of the home.

00:00:56.479 --> 00:01:00.170
Caleb enters his room, which will be his accommodation
for the next week.

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.510
He seems unhappy with the room since there
are no windows.

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.979
Nathan explains that there are no windows
because the building is not just a house but

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:10.829
also a research facility, and the walls are
fiber optic.

00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:14.690
Nathan makes Caleb sign a non-disclosure agreement
about the information that he is about to

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:15.700
share.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.630
He asks Caleb if he knows what a Turing test
is; it is a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.640
and human-like behaviour indistinguishably.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.359
Nathan reveals that Caleb will be the human
component in a Turing test over the next few

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:28.429
days.

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:32.329
This excites Caleb very much as he is highly
interested in artificial intelligence and

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:38.079
robots.During the first session, Caleb meets
Ava, the female humanoid robot programmed

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:40.749
with artificial intelligence, for the first
time.

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:44.189
Ava's body is robotic and very much machine-like.

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.979
Despite this, her face, hands, and feet resemble
that of a human.

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:53.140
Caleb is completely fascinated by her; they
have a conversation and continue to know each

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.140
other more.

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.070
At the same time, Nathan observes them from
a computer screen and takes notes about their

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:59.460
interaction.

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.649
Caleb tries to ask Ava complex questions to
test her artificial intelligence and ability

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:06.069
to communicate at a higher level.

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:09.729
Caleb reports to Nathan how well Ava's language
abilities are.

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.370
Nathan asks Caleb how he feels about Ava,
and Caleb responds that she is impressive.

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.120
They both continue having drinks, talk about
her and improvements that could be made.On

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.900
that night, Caleb struggles to fall asleep.

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.720
He turns on the TV in his room out of boredom,
which has access to cameras around the house.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.680
He sees Ava in her room writing on a desk
as if she is a natural person.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.810
Ava stands up from her desk, and all of a
sudden, power shuts down.

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.650
The facility is in total
lockdown, leaving Caleb trapped in his room.

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.640
The power restores; Caleb comes out and walks
around the house.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.660
He sees a telephone; to access it, he inserts
his key card, but he fails as Nathan tells

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.770
him that no one can access it.

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.650
Caleb says that a power cut happened in his
room; Nathan addresses it by saying that the

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.660
electricity in his home is still a work in
progress.

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.940
The following day, Kyoko, the servant, enters
Caleb's room to bring him a drink; Nathan

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.670
sends her to wake him up.

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.020
During their second session, Ava shows Caleb
her drawing.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.390
She asks him what it is since she has no idea
what she drew.

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.850
He explains that most people replicate images
that they have seen.

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:17.980
Ava offers Caleb if he wants to be friends
with her; he agrees, and this becomes the

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.680
initial turning point of Ava taking control
of the conversation.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.879
They have switched roles unknowingly, making
her the one asking questions.

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:29.909
Another power outage happens; both Caleb and
Ava are locked in the room.

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:34.290
Disturbingly, Ava warns Caleb that Nathan
is not his friend; he should be careful and

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.640
not trust anything that he says.

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.469
Caleb is taken aback by what Ava said, but
their session cuts shortly after the power

00:03:40.469 --> 00:03:46.849
restores.Over dinner, Kyoko spills wine on
Caleb, and Nathan becomes very mad about this.

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:51.290
He calls Kyoko bad names, and Caleb is shocked,
but Nathan assures him that she could not

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.099
speak and understand English.

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:57.659
Further, in their conversation, Nathan asks
what happened in the room during the power

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:00.560
cut, but Caleb claims nothing out of the ordinary
happened.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.250
In his room, Caleb continues to watch Ava
from the TV as she sleeps.

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.469
He is reflecting on their conversation because
he begins to feel attracted to her.

00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:13.290
During their third session, Ava shows Caleb
another drawing, but this time it is much

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.090
better than the last one.

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.100
She brings up that if she were to escape the
facility, she would go to the traffic intersection

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.960
as she wants to see a full but shifting view
of human life.

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.970
She says that Caleb could go with her.

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.070
A while later, Ava surprises Caleb by wearing
a dress and a wig.

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:30.890
She looks completely human.

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:34.020
He opens his eyes and compliments Ava's new
appearance.

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.630
She asks him about going on a date; at the
back of Caleb's mind, all this is highly doubtful

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:40.320
as she is just a robot.

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.270
He is now confused about his emotions and
how he feels toward Ava.

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:48.580
After that session, Caleb claims that Nathan
programmed Ava to flirt with him, but Nathan

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.850
says that she is just programmed to respond
as a female.

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:56.110
He then continues to say that there is a possibility
that she may be able to catch feelings for

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:57.230
Caleb.

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:01.620
During the fourth session, another power outage
occurs, and this time, Ava admits to being

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:06.820
the one responsible for it by reversing her
charge, causing the electricity to overload.

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:10.470
She warns him again that Nathan is a liar
and he should never trust him.

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:15.190
Caleb and Nathan are hiking in a nearby mountain;
Caleb realizes that he was not chosen at random

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.950
for the Turing test and that Nathan tricked
him.

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:20.410
Caleb brushes it
off when Nathan explains that he was selected

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:22.310
for his knowledge of code.

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:26.700
Caleb becomes wary of Nathan's narcissism
and his arrogant behavior toward Kyoko and

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:27.700
Ava.

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:30.580
On their fifth session, Ava's demeanor is
not the same.

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:35.050
She is more intimidating and starts asking
questions that Caleb answers accordingly.

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:39.570
This makes Caleb think about what will happen
to Ava if she does not pass the Turing test.

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:43.620
Ava becomes mad when it is brought up and
that anyone has the ability to shut her off

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:46.230
and why someone should be allowed to do so.

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:49.080
She shows Caleb a picture of him that she
drew from memory.

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:53.840
Nathan, however, ripped it in half, thus causing
him to distrust Nathan even more and take

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.060
Ava's side.

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:59.370
He discovers that Nathan intends to upgrade
Ava, having to delete her memory, including

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:03.780
Caleb, thereby "killing" her current personality
in the process.

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:08.340
Caleb encourages Nathan to drink more; because
of his drinking habits, he obliges and passes

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:10.470
out in a matter of minutes.

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:14.370
Caleb steals Nathan's keycard and goes into
his room to write a program on his computer

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:16.720
that will alter some of Nathan's codes.

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:21.330
He stumbles upon graphic and disturbing videos
of previous humanoid robots Nathan built that

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:24.740
destroyed themselves by trying to escape from
the facility.

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:29.340
In another room, Kyoko reveals herself as
a robot; she peels off her skin in front of

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:30.340
Caleb.

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:34.740
Anxious and confused, he goes back to his
room and examines his body parts, being concerned

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:36.650
that he may also be a robot.

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:42.420
He cuts his arm open with his razor to examine
his flesh, which confirms that he is, indeed,

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:47.350
human.During session six, Ava once again shuts
down the electricity, and Caleb presents a

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:50.040
plan for Ava to escape from the facility.

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:54.740
He tells her that Nathan is planning on reprograming
her, which is equivalent to being "killed."

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:58.950
The plan is to get Nathan drunk and reprogram
the security system to open the doors during

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:01.770
a power failure that Ava can manage.

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:04.980
As soon as the power cuts off, both of them
can escape.

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:09.030
Their idea does not go as planned because
Nathan declines to drink with him.

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:12.940
Nathan reveals to him that he observed and
heard his and Ava's last secret conversation

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:16.970
with a battery-powered camera, as well as
Caleb cutting himself.

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:21.020
Caleb and Nathan share a conversation about
Ava just pretending to like him and just using

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:22.530
him as an escape.

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:25.130
This is the real test, according to Nathan.

00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:29.750
Ava has shown exceptional intelligence by
being able to manipulate Caleb.

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:33.760
In the meantime, Ava shuts the power off at
10:00 as agreed.

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:37.720
Caleb admits that he suspected Nathan was
watching them and modified the security system

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:42.230
the previous day when Nathan was drunk and
passed out, disabling the locked door on Ava's

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:43.230
cell.

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:47.090
Nathan is now anxious; he fears what will
happen if Ava gets out of her cell.

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:51.090
Seeing from the surveillance camera that she
manages to get out, Nathan does not know what

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:52.140
to do.

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:55.920
Out of anger, he knocks Caleb unconscious
and rushes to Ava.

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:58.120
Nathan sees her with Kyoko in the
hallway.

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:03.010
Ava runs and attacks him, but he manages to
get up and punish Ava by destroying her arm.

00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:06.660
Kyoko stabs Nathan, but in return, he destroys
her.

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:09.750
Ava stabs him once again, eventually killing
him.

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:15.180
Ava proceeds to Nathan's private room to repair
herself with the parts of other inactive robots.

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:18.640
She takes pieces of their skin to cover her
robotic appearance.

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:21.300
She dresses while Caleb looks at her longingly.

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:25.300
She passes by the room where he is in and
completely ignores him, confirming that she

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:28.460
was manipulating him and no feelings were
involved.

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:32.229
Caleb is left alone in the facility, all locked
while Ava goes free.

00:08:32.229 --> 00:08:35.349
The helicopter that is meant for Caleb takes
her instead.

00:08:35.349 --> 00:08:48.810
She arrives in a big city and easily blends
in with the crowd.
