00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.500
Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.370
Today, I'm going to explain a drama thriller
film called "Into the Forest."

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:06.660
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.400
Watch out and take care.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.370
Massive power outages have been occurring
throughout the west coast of the U.S. due

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.540
to an unidentified fault in the grid.

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:19.960
In a secluded home in the forest, Robert and
his daughters, Nell and Eva, are going through

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.050
their typical routines when the power outage
suddenly hits their home.

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.390
Nell, who was studying for her S.A.T. exam,
tries reading books with a battery-operated

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.560
flashlight, but the battery runs out too,
so she heads to the car to grab a headlamp.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.090
In the morning, Robert asks his daughter to
come with him to town to get some fuel.

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.629
However, their jeep wouldn't start because
the battery is drained.

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:42.190
When Nell turns on the news on her solar-powered
radio, they learn that the outage is happening

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:43.460
across the region.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.739
The report explains that a problem at one
power plant had triggered shut-downs across

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:47.980
the power grid.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.219
Transportation has been crippled because there
is no way to operate the subway system and

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:53.500
the airports without fuel and electricity.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.129
A few days go by, Robert is still looking
for a way to get his car running.

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:00.249
Nell suggests walking, but Robert tells her
that it will take three days to reach the

00:01:00.249 --> 00:01:01.359
nearest town.

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:05.549
Eva, who's studying interpretative dance,
is left with no choice but to practice without

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:06.549
music.

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:09.250
Soon, they stop hearing anything from the
radio.

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.640
Robert notices that Nell is still worried
about her S.A.T., so he assures her that she'll

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.720
pass with flying colors.&nbsp;

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.130
After ten days without power, Robert approaches
Nell to tell her that he has an idea how to

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:19.790
get their jeep to run.

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.159
Robert takes the chainsaw apart and removes
the chain, so he could use it to get the vehicle's

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.350
motor going.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.110
The girls jump for joy when they hear the
engine running.

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.229
As they pass by the nearest house, Robert
notices that their neighbor has left their

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:31.229
home.

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.549
They soon arrive at the store, but the supplies
are almost cleared out.

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:39.170
As they look at what's left, Stan, the store
clerk, pumps his shotgun and asks Robert if

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:40.509
he has money.

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:43.280
Robert assures him that he's capable of paying
for what they need.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.431
When Robert asks if he knows where they can
get some fuel, Stan tells Robert to go to

00:01:46.431 --> 00:01:48.570
the back of the store when they're done shopping.

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.820
Nell reminds Robert that they need an inverter
for the solar panels, but Stan tells them

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.310
that there hasn't been any shipment for some
time due to the lack of gas.

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.509
At the back of the store, Stan sells them
a few gallons of fuel.

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:01.430
The clerks ask them if they're planning on
leaving town, but Robert tells him that they'll

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.500
wait until the power returns.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.159
After leaving the store, Eva attends her interpretative
dance class while Nell meets up with her friend

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:08.520
Eli.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.950
After spending the whole day together, Eli
kisses Nell, saying it feels like it's the

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.230
end of the world.

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.250
When Robert comes to fetch Nell, she's already
too drunk.

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.580
Before leaving, Eli gives Nell another kiss
and tells her that he hopes to see her again

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.220
the following week.

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.970
On their way home, Robert notices a car pulled
up on the side of the road, so he goes down

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.450
to see if they need help.

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.950
When he gets out of his jeep, one of the men
shows off his shotgun, so Robert gets back

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.890
into his vehicle and drives home.

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.610
The next morning, Robert tells the girls that
they wouldn't be going to town for a while.

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.280
He asserts that they're safe at home and they
have enough supplies.

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.370
However, Nell gets upset and tells him that
she'll drive the jeep on her own.

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.640
While chopping wood outside the house, Nell
asks Robert if he intends to stay home for

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.070
the rest of their lives.

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.250
He assures her that they'll only wait until
the power goes back on.

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.730
Nell is still angry about Robert's decision,
so she lashes out at him when he calls her

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:54.730
"pumpkin."

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.290
Later, Robert heads into the forest to cut
down a tree with the chainsaw.

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.240
The girls suddenly hear him screaming.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.540
When they reach the area, they see a large
wound on Robert's leg.

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.970
Eva quickly applies pressure on the wound
while Nell ties a belt around it.

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.180
Despite their efforts, Robert feels like he's
not going to make it, so he encourages the

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.340
girls to take care of each other.

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.680
Nell cries as she tells Robert that he's going
to be fine, but Robert eventually succumbs

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:16.870
to his wounds.

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.980
The girls lie down beside Robert in the woods
until the morning and bury him right on the

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.370
spot where he died.

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.590
Back home, Eva, still in shock about the loss
of her father, takes a bath to clean up the

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:26.590
blood.

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.480
Nell, on the other hand, tries to hold on
to a memory of Robert by smelling his shirt.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.041
Two months after the power failure, the girls'
food supply is already running low, and they're

00:03:34.041 --> 00:03:35.510
barely getting by.

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.650
Eva has since started to suffer from depression
and refuses to eat breakfast with her sister.

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:43.320
When Eva gets frustrated practicing her dance
without music, she asks Nell to fill the generator

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.510
with gas.

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.451
She tells Nell that she wants to watch their
parents in their home videos and dance with

00:03:47.451 --> 00:03:49.840
music instead of just hearing the ticks of
the metronome.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.910
However, Nell stresses that they need the
gas for their jeep.

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:56.430
Eva notes that they only need four gallons,
leaving them with one gallon to spare, but

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.680
Nell insists that they have to save the fuel
for an emergency.

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.270
Feeling disappointed by Nell's refusal, Eva
covers her windows with white sheets and refuses

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:04.900
to come out of the dance room.

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.750
The following day, Nell finds out that their
chickens have been attacked by wild boars.

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.850
She tries to inform Eva, but she still refuses
to come out.

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:15.190
When Eva finally leaves her room, she goes
to the kitchen to grab the food and walks

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:16.190
away.

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.000
Nell tries to reason with her, but Eva tells
Nell that she clearly doesn't understand how

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.329
she feels.

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:24.669
One night, Nell reaches out for Eva as they
sleep, but she finds out that Eva's not there.

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:27.889
She runs outside and calls out to her as wild
boars roar around her.

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:30.770
Eva soon hears Nell crying and wakes her up
from her bad dream.

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.169
As Eva tries to comfort her, Nell tells Eva
that she dreamed that the pigs attacked their

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:36.550
father and she couldn't find her anywhere.

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.750
While cleaning up a drawer one evening, Nell
finds a plastic easter egg with a piece of

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.030
chocolate inside, so she calls Eva, hoping
to share it with her.

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.639
When she doesn't respond, she goes ahead and
eats it.

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:49.030
As she savors the taste in her mouth, Eva
enters the room and begs her to let her use

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.360
the generator for just 10 minutes.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.710
Nell tells Eva that she still can't agree
to her request, but she has a surprise that

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:55.860
she might like.

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.160
She shows Eva the plastic easter egg with
two pieces of gum, saying she can have both

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:00.160
of them.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.610
However, Eva soon notices the chocolate wrapper
and gets mad at Nell when she hears that Nell

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:04.919
already ate it.

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:07.720
Nell explains that she didn't think that Eva
would mind because she ignored her when she

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:08.919
called.

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:12.810
As they argue, the girls suddenly hear someone
knocking on the door, so they grab a gun and

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:13.810
hide.

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:17.060
When the knocking continues, Nell uses her
low voice, pretending to be a man, to ask

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:18.370
who's at the door.

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:20.949
She hears Eli answering, so she opens the
door.

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:24.639
Eli tells them that he was riding his bike
on his way to their house, but he got a flat,

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:25.840
so he walked.

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.660
When Eli asks where their father is, Eva tells
him that he died in an accident.

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:33.860
Eli informs them that people in town are starting
to get sick because there's no water filtration.

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:36.860
He thought that Nell already died when she
stopped coming to town.

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.080
Nell explains that they couldn't visit the
town because they ran out of gas.

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:43.090
When Eli asks if they have bicycles, they
tell him that their father gave them away

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:44.770
to kids at a school.

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:48.159
The following day, Nell takes Eli deep into
the woods to show him a shed made out of a

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:49.389
tree stump.

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:52.749
When they reach the shed, Nell takes him inside
and makes love to him.

00:05:52.749 --> 00:05:56.440
When they get back home, Eli plays the harmonica
for the girls, but Eva suddenly gets up and

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:57.580
leaves the room.

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:01.440
Eli thinks that he must have offended her,
but Nell explains that Eva will probably practice

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:02.440
dancing.

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:06.159
Eli wonders why she still does it, given their
current situation, so Nell discloses that

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:08.310
Eva still looks forward to the audition.

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:11.080
Nell points out that she herself feels the
need to keep studying.

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:14.300
Eli notes that they're just like other people
who keep checking their mailbox even when

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.680
no mail has arrived in town for months.

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:20.249
In the morning, Eva asks Nell how long Eli's
going to stay with them.

00:06:20.249 --> 00:06:23.270
She points out that he's eating their food
when they're already running out.

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:26.520
When Nell asks her why she doesn't like him,
Eva ignores the question and warns her not

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:29.389
to get pregnant because they can't take care
of a baby.

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:32.659
While spending time at the shed, Eli tells
Nell that electricity has started to come

00:06:32.659 --> 00:06:33.969
back in the east.

00:06:33.969 --> 00:06:36.419
He plans to go there and wants to take Nell
with him.

00:06:36.419 --> 00:06:39.629
When Nell asks him why he didn't tell them
when he first came to the house, Eli says

00:06:39.629 --> 00:06:42.520
that he wanted to get to know Nell first and
make sure that she's the one he wants to take

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:43.759
with him.

00:06:43.759 --> 00:06:47.009
Nell wants to go, but Eva is skeptical about
Eli's plans.

00:06:47.009 --> 00:06:49.990
She thinks that the journey would take too
long because they will be on foot.

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:53.879
Eli argues that it's not fair for them if
they just wait at home and nothing happens.

00:06:53.879 --> 00:06:57.319
Eva wants to stay behind, but she tells Nell
that she can go if she wants.

00:06:57.319 --> 00:07:01.060
As Nell and Eli prepare to leave, Eva gives
her a gun, but Nell says they already have

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:02.539
enough firearms.

00:07:02.539 --> 00:07:05.280
Nell apologizes for not letting her use the
generator.

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:08.160
She wishes that they could've stayed one more
night, so they could have a party and watch

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:09.389
Eva dance.

00:07:09.389 --> 00:07:12.100
Nell goes on to tell Eva that she is hoping
that they can stick together because they

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:13.650
only have each other.

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:17.379
Eva stresses that she's always going to be
Nell's sister despite their choices.

00:07:17.379 --> 00:07:20.919
After they leave, Eva practices her dance,
but she gets frustrated from being left by

00:07:20.919 --> 00:07:22.940
Nell, so she throws the metronome.

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:27.180
Out in the forest, Nell and Eli decide to
rest beside a large tree as it gets dark.

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:30.330
When Nell wakes up in the morning, she tells
Eli that she can't go with him because she

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:32.139
can't leave Eva behind.

00:07:32.139 --> 00:07:35.979
Before parting ways, Eli kisses Nell and says
he will love her however he can.

00:07:35.979 --> 00:07:39.289
Nell runs back to the house and apologizes
to Eva for leaving.

00:07:39.289 --> 00:07:43.439
As they run low on food, the girls decide
to go into the forest to find edible plants.

00:07:43.439 --> 00:07:46.499
They manage to gather lots of berries, so
they dry them out in the sun and put them

00:07:46.499 --> 00:07:47.699
in jars.

00:07:47.699 --> 00:07:51.220
Days after Eli left, Nell is delighted to
learn that she's on her period.

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:54.900
Later that night, she takes a bottle of alcohol
and invites Eva to drink.

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:57.979
When Eva reminds her that they're supposed
to be saving the liquor for childbirth, Nell

00:07:57.979 --> 00:08:01.009
stresses that no one is giving birth in the
house any time soon.

00:08:01.009 --> 00:08:05.009
They start drinking from the bottle and decide
to turn on the generator for a few minutes.

00:08:05.009 --> 00:08:08.169
After turning the power on, they sit together
and watch their family's home videos.

00:08:08.169 --> 00:08:11.949
Later on, Nell watches Eva practice her dance
with music.

00:08:11.949 --> 00:08:16.600
When the generator goes out, Nell pours the
fuel into another container while Eva is asleep.

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:20.220
The following day, Nell leaves the house to
gather some blueberries in the woods.

00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:22.919
While Eva is chopping some wood, a man approaches
her.

00:08:22.919 --> 00:08:26.180
When she turns around, she recognizes him
as Stan, the store clerk.

00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:29.669
Stan tells Eva he was headed north, but he
heard her chopping some wood, so he decided

00:08:29.669 --> 00:08:30.919
to drop by.

00:08:30.919 --> 00:08:34.980
When Stan notices the woodpile behind Eva,
he asks her if she cut it by herself.

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:36.810
Eva tells him that his father chopped it.

00:08:36.810 --> 00:08:39.860
Stan says he wants to talk with her father,
so she tells him that he's in the woods and

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:41.440
he's coming back any minute.

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:44.320
Stan tells her that he's going to stay until
his father arrives.

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:49.030
As Stan starts walking close to her, Eva holds
on to her ax, preparing to defend herself.

00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:52.610
Before she could move away, Stan suddenly
grabs her and throws away her ax.

00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:55.980
Eva fights back by elbowing him in the gut
and kneeing him on the crotch, but Stan manages

00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:58.220
to get on top of her and pin her down.

00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:02.040
After striking her in the face, Stan starts
removing his pants and forces himself on Eva

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:03.670
as she screams.

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:06.520
After a while, Stan gets up and leaves her
on the ground.

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:10.520
As Nell is walking home, she hears Eva screaming,
so she drops the berries and runs toward the

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:11.580
house.

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:15.210
Before she arrives, Stan grabs a gasoline
container and steals their car.

00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:19.040
When she reaches the yard, Nell grabs the
ax and looks around for the assailant, shouting

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:20.380
that she'll kill him.

00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:23.600
After making sure that the man has left, Nell
takes Eva back to the house and gives her

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:24.600
a pill.

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:27.840
When Nell tries to comfort her, Eva recoils
from her touch.

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:30.520
That night, Eva tells Nell that she misses
their mother.

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:33.610
Nell recalls how fascinated she was watching
them dance together because it seemed like

00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:34.770
she saw double.

00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:37.510
Nell then confides that she misses their father
as well.

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:40.490
The next day, the girls start boarding up
their entire house.

00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:44.710
As the days go by, Eva has become even more
depressed and has not been eating properly.

00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:48.070
One day, Nell turns on the generator to cheer
up Eva with music.

00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:51.580
Eva recalls that Stan had stolen their last
container of fuel, so she asks Nell where

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:52.660
she got it.

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:55.410
Nell discloses that she hid a few gallons
some days ago.

00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:59.000
Nell invites her to dance and have some fun,
but Eva seems disinterested, so Nell turns

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.570
the music off.

00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:03.520
Eight months after the power outage, Nell
becomes disgusted with the canned food they

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:04.850
usually eat.

00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:08.370
While searching around the house, Nell finds
a note marked "pumpkin," so he calls Eva and

00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:09.750
shows it to her.

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:13.670
Nell thinks that it must be special, so she
tells Eva that they should read it outside.

00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:17.750
When they unfold the paper, they realize that
it's not a note at all but pumpkin seeds.

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:21.020
While Nell is digging up the garden, she hurts
her back while lifting a huge rock, so she

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:22.330
calls Eva for help.

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:26.260
Eva, still traumatized by her experience in
the yard, hesitantly runs toward Nell and

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:27.960
takes her inside the house.

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:30.830
As she massages Nell's back, she starts to
cry.

00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:33.860
She tells Nell that she's afraid because she
feels like black waves are swallowing her

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:35.000
up.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.020
When Eva starts to eat properly again, Nell
notices that she feels constantly nauseated.

00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:42.520
Eva tells her that she's just queasy, but
Nell already suspects that she's pregnant,

00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:45.310
so she starts researching how they could terminate
the pregnancy.

00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:48.340
While she's reading up on the subject, Eva
confirms to her that she's pregnant and she

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:51.410
wants to keep the baby because she doesn't
want to lose anything else.

00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:54.610
When Nell reminds her how she got pregnant,
Eva tells her that the baby has nothing to

00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:56.280
do with what happened to her.

00:10:56.280 --> 00:11:00.000
She argues that the baby shouldn't be held
responsible for the parent's actions.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.650
As the pregnancy progresses, Nell helps Eva
with her diet to ensure that the baby is born

00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:04.650
healthy.

00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:08.160
She learns that a lack of vitamin B-12 may
be the cause of Eva's fatigue and nausea,

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:11.950
so she goes out to the woods to hunt a wild
boar because it is a good source of B-12.

00:11:11.950 --> 00:11:15.330
As she waits for the pigs to arrive, she falls
asleep on a branch of a tree.

00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:17.870
Soon, the sound of the boar awakens her.

00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:21.570
Nell shoots the animal and falls down from
the tree due to the recoil of her rifle.

00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:24.880
After getting back up, she runs toward the
boar and sees that it's still alive, so she

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:27.960
apologizes to the pig before shooting it again.

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:31.370
After bringing the wild boar home, she starts
skinning it and removing its organs.

00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:34.750
They separate the animal's fat, so they could
use it to make soap.

00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:37.400
When they finally eat it, they're delighted
that they get to eat something other than

00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:38.850
canned food.

00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:43.170
While relaxing outside the house, Eva tells
Nell that her child will become a dancer someday.

00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:45.570
She lets Nell feel the baby kicking in her
womb.

00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:48.650
Nell tells her that the baby could be female,
but Eva is convinced that her child will be

00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:50.230
a boy, so they make a bet.

00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:54.080
One evening, Eva suddenly smells something
outside while they eat dinner.

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:57.820
Nell suspects that it's a phantom smell caused
by her pregnancy, but Eva says that it smells

00:11:57.820 --> 00:11:59.960
like smoke coming from outside the house.

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:02.460
Nell takes a brief look outside and finds
nothing.

00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:05.650
Eva fears that Stan might be camping near
their house, but Nell says she doesn't think

00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:07.120
he'll return.

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:11.120
As the girls are sleeping, they are suddenly
awakened by a loud noise inside the house.

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:14.450
When Nell gets up to investigate, she finds
that a beam had collapsed.

00:12:14.450 --> 00:12:18.010
Eva suddenly feels contractions as more parts
of their house fall, so she tells Nell that

00:12:18.010 --> 00:12:19.940
they should get out of the house.

00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:23.010
Nell and Eva walk to the shed in the woods
so she can give birth there.

00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:26.140
Upon their arrival, Eva starts to feel more
contractions.

00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:30.390
Not long after, Eva starts to feel the baby
coming out, so Nell prepares to take the infant.

00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:33.900
Later, Nell tells Eva that she was right about
giving birth to a boy.

00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:37.280
When they get inside the house, Eva notices
the smell of black mold.

00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:40.370
She tells Nell that she can't raise the baby
in their house because it's not safe.

00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:43.640
Eva takes the fuel they have left and tells
Nell that she wants to use it because she

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:44.640
won their bet.

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:47.380
Eva tells Nell that she will use the gas to
burn their house down because it's already

00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:48.710
falling apart.

00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:51.390
Eva explains that someone would eventually
come looking for them.

00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:54.870
If they leave, someone will move into the
house, but if they burn it, people would think

00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:56.750
that they died in the fire.

00:12:56.750 --> 00:13:00.580
Eva points out that the house is rotting,
and it's impossible for them to fix the roof.

00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:03.720
Nell worries about starting a forest fire,
but Eva assures her that it's too wet because

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:05.250
of the recent rains.

00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:08.580
Eva further notes that humans haven't lived
without electricity for a long time, so she

00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:10.920
argues that they'll be able to survive out
in the woods.

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:14.760
Soon, Nell agrees with Eva, but she takes
some time to look at the pictures of her family

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:16.310
before they burn their house.

00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:20.590
Later on, Eva douses the house with gasoline
after they take some essential items.

00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:23.670
Nell then lights up the fire and hesitantly
throws it into the house.

00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:34.160
After watching the house burn for a while,
they walk to the woods to find a way to survive

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:36.520
outside of their home.
