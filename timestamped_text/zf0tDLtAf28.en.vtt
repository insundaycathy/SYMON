00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:07.963
hey what's up guys

00:00:08.155 --> 00:00:11.755
today I'll show you a science fiction thriller film: "Stowaway"

00:00:11.947 --> 00:00:14.443
spoiler ahead, watch out and take care

00:00:14.971 --> 00:00:19.627
the crew of three dock with their starship to Mars, for a two-year science research mission

00:00:19.723 --> 00:00:22.075
as the mission Commander, Marina is taking off

00:00:22.171 --> 00:00:25.147
together with biologist David and medical researcher Zoe

00:00:25.387 --> 00:00:28.171
the significance of this trip to Mars is so extraordinary 

00:00:28.267 --> 00:00:31.147
that even the veteran astronaut Marina's heart beats fast 

00:00:31.387 --> 00:00:35.611
followed by some violent vibrations, they safely pass through the danger zone 

00:00:35.803 --> 00:00:39.163
Zoe is mesmerized by the breath-taking beauty of the space 

00:00:39.259 --> 00:00:42.475
David reckons with a smile that it is his best trip ever 

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:44.923
when the spaceship is approaching the destination

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:47.803
Marina successfully docks it to the space station 

00:00:47.851 --> 00:00:53.083
then various parts slot into the space station to unroll the solar panels to provide power

00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:57.499
when that is set, the trio move into the space station and settle down 

00:00:57.787 --> 00:01:02.107
everyone is relieved at the arrival and excited for their new chapter of life 

00:01:02.203 --> 00:01:06.859
Zoe does a quick health check for the team and gladly concludes that everyone is fine 

00:01:06.955 --> 00:01:11.371
the sight of Planet earth is so beautiful that each glance brings abundant joy to Zoe 

00:01:11.563 --> 00:01:14.203
so far, the trip has been a smooth sailing

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:17.035
Marina reports the current status to the mission control 

00:01:17.083 --> 00:01:20.155
and ensures them they are confident of accomplishing the mission 

00:01:20.347 --> 00:01:24.427
among the crew, Marina is in charge of the technical operation of the ship

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:28.267
Zoe carries out medical research and takes care of their well-being 

00:01:28.555 --> 00:01:33.403
David shoulders the crucial responsibility to cultivate plants that are suitable for Mars 

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:36.811
and looks into expanding the Martain ecology in the future 

00:01:37.051 --> 00:01:39.643
while the scientists are occupied with their research work

00:01:39.739 --> 00:01:43.435
Marina walks around the spacecraft to check its device and relevant data 

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:47.755
suddenly, a drop of blood on the command module floor catches her attention 

00:01:47.851 --> 00:01:51.787
looking up, she finds the blood dripping from the overhead compartment of the starship 

00:01:52.267 --> 00:01:53.803
she quickly drills it open 

00:01:54.043 --> 00:01:58.651
to her shock, when she pops the overhead compartment open, a bloodied body tumbles out

00:01:58.843 --> 00:02:02.971
worse still, the connecting pipe is going to break due to the overwhelming weight 

00:02:03.067 --> 00:02:06.811
as Marina tries her best to hold up the man, she is injured 

00:02:06.907 --> 00:02:10.555
at the same time, the broken pipe leads to a severe gas leakage 

00:02:10.795 --> 00:02:16.219
fortunately, David and Zoe come over to lend a helping hand, saving the golden time for salvage  

00:02:16.507 --> 00:02:18.283
Marina shuts the leaking valve 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:22.267
but the situation deteriorates so drastically that she has to close the cabin 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.723
on the other hand, Zoe gives the man an emergency treatment 

00:02:25.867 --> 00:02:29.035
he has a long cut on his waist and is bleeding profusely 

00:02:29.179 --> 00:02:32.971
after Zoe stitches up his wounds, his condition is kept under control 

00:02:33.067 --> 00:02:36.571
while the man falls in a coma, the crew gather for a discussion  

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:39.931
they have no idea about the identity or motive of the man

00:02:40.027 --> 00:02:43.435
just when they are rendered clueless, Marina discovers his work pass 

00:02:43.531 --> 00:02:46.267
and confirms the man's identity with the mission control

00:02:46.555 --> 00:02:48.907
but she is told that he is not part of the mission 

00:02:48.955 --> 00:02:51.883
Marina hence suspects that the man is a stowaway

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:54.763
but no one knows why he would board the spaceship 

00:02:55.003 --> 00:02:58.603
Marina has to take more rest until her arm injury recovers 

00:02:58.843 --> 00:03:01.723
so most of the workload falls on Zoe and David 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:06.523
one dire consequence they are faced with is the rising level of carbon dioxide 

00:03:06.667 --> 00:03:11.659
to keep the cabin safe, David takes out the spare oxygen cylinder and releases it 

00:03:11.947 --> 00:03:15.259
at this time,  Stowaway wakes up and wobbles out of the cabin 

00:03:15.451 --> 00:03:18.907
when he sees the Earth through the porthole, he is totally freaked out 

00:03:19.051 --> 00:03:21.931
the fact that he has gone out to the space is unbelievable 

00:03:22.075 --> 00:03:25.435
when Stowaway is confused, Zoe tells him to calm down 

00:03:25.771 --> 00:03:28.699
it takes a while for Stowaway to regain his composure 

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:31.915
he has many questions to ask, and so do the crew members 

00:03:32.011 --> 00:03:35.227
it turns out that Stowaway is a launch tech of the space center 

00:03:35.323 --> 00:03:38.491
but he does not know why he is jammed up in the crawl space 

00:03:38.587 --> 00:03:42.091
the last thing he remembers is having a walk with his daughter 

00:03:42.331 --> 00:03:46.171
when Stowaway learns that the spaceship has been sailing for more than 12 hours

00:03:46.219 --> 00:03:48.619
he begs Marina to send him back to Earth 

00:03:48.811 --> 00:03:51.931
no one on board is authorized to entertain such a request 

00:03:52.075 --> 00:03:55.627
in order to give Stowaway some personal time to juggle such an accident

00:03:55.675 --> 00:03:57.259
the trio left his cabin 

00:03:57.451 --> 00:04:00.283
later, Stowaway picks himself up to face the music 

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:03.307
and apologizes to the crew for his ruthless reactions 

00:04:03.451 --> 00:04:08.443
Marina updates the mission control about Stowaway and waits for their further instruction 

00:04:08.683 --> 00:04:11.323
though Stowaway does not join the trip by his own will

00:04:11.371 --> 00:04:14.347
he will have to work together with the team for the time being 

00:04:14.635 --> 00:04:18.187
on the second day, Zoe takes Stowaway around for orientation 

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:21.451
when Stowaway sees the Earth, he is much more calmer 

00:04:21.643 --> 00:04:24.091
still, the pretty blue globe pierces his heart 

00:04:24.331 --> 00:04:27.211
Stowaway soon keeps himself busy helping David 

00:04:27.355 --> 00:04:31.387
on the other hand, Marina has performed a thorough check of the broken cabin

00:04:31.531 --> 00:04:36.715
to their dismay, all the damaged parts are burnt down, and the chance of repair is rather slim

00:04:36.907 --> 00:04:41.467
the life support system of the spacecraft, which removes carbon dioxide from the air

00:04:41.563 --> 00:04:43.147
is destroyed severely

00:04:43.243 --> 00:04:47.371
as a result, carbon dioxide is increasing while the oxygen is dropping 

00:04:47.611 --> 00:04:52.651
Marina informs the headquarter about the detrimental challenge, but she receives no reply 

00:04:52.795 --> 00:04:56.107
it is clear that they will have to deal with the matter themselves 

00:04:56.203 --> 00:05:01.723
Marina explains to David that the life support system fails to create any oxygen from now on 

00:05:02.011 --> 00:05:04.939
so their life depends on the existing amount of oxygen 

00:05:05.131 --> 00:05:09.883
Marina is curious if David's plants can produce enough oxygen for their survival 

00:05:10.123 --> 00:05:14.203
however, the amount of oxygen produced by the plants is negligible 

00:05:14.443 --> 00:05:18.763
to save time, David offers to try it with newly cultivated seaweed

00:05:18.955 --> 00:05:22.075
but it is up to chance whether it would provide more oxygen

00:05:22.171 --> 00:05:24.667
then he begins to cultivate algae

00:05:24.811 --> 00:05:28.843
Zoe and Marina have brought the malfunctioned critical equipment back to the cabin

00:05:28.939 --> 00:05:30.619
hoping that it can be repaired 

00:05:30.907 --> 00:05:33.739
the good news is that the algae do release more oxygen

00:05:34.075 --> 00:05:36.619
but David is reluctant to continue with the work 

00:05:36.811 --> 00:05:39.979
these plants are to be sent to Mars for life cultivation

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:43.435
so it is really a pity to just make oxygen out from them 

00:05:43.531 --> 00:05:45.883
Marina understands David's concerns 

00:05:45.931 --> 00:05:49.675
but the life support device is completely burned and beyond repair 

00:05:49.915 --> 00:05:53.227
they will have to deal with the shortage of oxygen sooner or later 

00:05:53.323 --> 00:05:56.779
their survival is at risk without enough supply of oxygen 

00:05:57.019 --> 00:06:00.525
without much choice, David puts his important plants aside 

00:06:00.525 --> 00:06:03.355
and fully focuses on cultivating more algae 

00:06:03.691 --> 00:06:05.803
however, even though more algae are grown

00:06:05.851 --> 00:06:09.451
the amount of oxygen it can create is far less than required 

00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:12.667
Stowaway has gradually adapted to life in space 

00:06:12.763 --> 00:06:15.883
and become more actively involved in the expedition to Mars 

00:06:16.027 --> 00:06:19.867
to their dismay, the new batch of algae cultivated has all died 

00:06:20.155 --> 00:06:23.659
it is a blow for David, and a fatal wound for the ship's crew

00:06:23.803 --> 00:06:26.443
then another fatal blow comes from headquarters

00:06:26.635 --> 00:06:29.995
in response to their report, the mission control does a simulation 

00:06:30.091 --> 00:06:33.643
and finds out that the remaining oxygen could only support two people

00:06:34.027 --> 00:06:38.875
given that right now, there are four passengers on board, meaning two of them have to die

00:06:39.067 --> 00:06:42.859
Marina gathers the two scientists to reveal such a stark reality 

00:06:42.955 --> 00:06:46.411
even with David's plants supplying oxygen for a third crew member

00:06:46.507 --> 00:06:48.475
they still have to give up one life 

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:52.884
since Stowaway is the extra one, David and Marina suggest dumping him

00:06:53.124 --> 00:06:55.140
but Zoe is totally against the plan

00:06:55.236 --> 00:06:59.172
she argues that sacrificing Stowaway is no different from committing murder 

00:06:59.316 --> 00:07:04.548
given the current rate of oxygen consumption, there is still enough oxygen to last for a while

00:07:04.692 --> 00:07:08.436
Zoe urges the team to think of other solutions in the next ten days 

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:11.844
should all other plans fail, they will turn to the last resort 

00:07:11.988 --> 00:07:17.028
however, Stowaway knows nothing about the crisis, and the rest just pretends nothing happens

00:07:17.316 --> 00:07:20.868
time ticks away day by day, and the oxygen is running out

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:25.044
Zoe cries in secret because there is no way for them to restore the equipment 

00:07:25.284 --> 00:07:28.596
so all she has done is buying a little time for Stowaway

00:07:28.884 --> 00:07:32.676
David breaks with routine and explains the situation to Stowaway

00:07:32.772 --> 00:07:35.364
providing him with a painless lethal injection

00:07:35.508 --> 00:07:40.932
after all, as a stowaway, he cannot contribute to the mission, but he is consuming their oxygen

00:07:41.172 --> 00:07:44.484
Stowaway feels guilty for being such a burden to the crew

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:46.596
but committing suicide is nothing simple 

00:07:46.692 --> 00:07:51.444
during his struggles, he has tried to administer a shot, but in the end, he gives up 

00:07:51.588 --> 00:07:54.372
however, the fate of the mission depends on his choice 

00:07:54.516 --> 00:07:59.076
after much consideration, Stowaway bids farewell to his daughter via a video call 

00:07:59.268 --> 00:08:03.012
Zoe happens to discover Stowaway downcast in pain and sorrow 

00:08:03.204 --> 00:08:06.228
the injection syringe lying on the floor says it all 

00:08:06.372 --> 00:08:08.532
Zoe does not want to give up so easily 

00:08:08.676 --> 00:08:11.700
she encourages Stowaway not to give up with her own story 

00:08:11.892 --> 00:08:14.532
Zoe was once drowned but saved in the end 

00:08:14.676 --> 00:08:18.372
so even in the direst situation, she does not say die 

00:08:18.468 --> 00:08:22.644
since there is time before the dateline, Zoe asks Stowaway to cheer up 

00:08:22.884 --> 00:08:27.492
moved by her sharing, Stowaway finally stops his attempts to commit suicide 

00:08:27.828 --> 00:08:31.284
Zoe then speaks with David and rails against him for his immorality 

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:35.508
but David insists that the current situation rules out other choices for them 

00:08:35.652 --> 00:08:38.436
it is unfair to accuse him of killing Stowaway 

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:43.044
in fact, to save the crew, he has forgone his plants cultivated for years 

00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:45.636
those plants might not be important to others

00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:48.564
but to him, they are as precious as his own life 

00:08:48.708 --> 00:08:53.076
David in turn, criticizes Zoe for not fathoming his sacrifice 

00:08:53.316 --> 00:08:56.964
Zoe continues to search and try various ways to resolve the crisis 

00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:58.836
and she thinks of a solution 

00:08:59.028 --> 00:09:02.580
there must extra supply of oxygen in other parts of the spaceship 

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:07.620
as long as they climb the tethers, they will be able to locate and obtain the emergency supply

00:09:07.812 --> 00:09:11.796
Stowaway wants to give it a try, but he has not been trained for spacewalks 

00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:15.348
even though Zoe gives him a detailed briefing and demonstration

00:09:15.444 --> 00:09:17.412
Stowaway cannot master the movements 

00:09:17.508 --> 00:09:22.164
if the crew decides to go ahead with the plan, David will have to venture together with Zoe 

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.332
however, let alone various kinds of potential risks

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:28.932
when they move out of the cabin, they will deplete the oxygen supply 

00:09:29.172 --> 00:09:31.668
if the mission fails, the crew is doomed 

00:09:31.764 --> 00:09:35.220
however, if they do not take the risk, Stowaway will have to die 

00:09:35.316 --> 00:09:39.252
after rounds of careful considerations, Marina endorses the plan 

00:09:39.396 --> 00:09:44.100
she makes clear to David and Zoe all the precautions before they embark on the journey 

00:09:44.436 --> 00:09:47.316
so David and Zoe leave the cabin to climb up the tethers 

00:09:47.412 --> 00:09:50.628
at first, it is very difficult for them to move up 

00:09:50.772 --> 00:09:52.548
but the situation becomes better 

00:09:52.596 --> 00:09:56.052
when the space station rotates, and the gravitational pull weakens

00:09:56.196 --> 00:09:58.596
they slide smoothly across the solar panel

00:09:58.788 --> 00:10:01.764
as David wanders far away, Zoe pulls him back 

00:10:01.908 --> 00:10:04.452
and then they have to descend to the destination 

00:10:04.596 --> 00:10:06.925
even though this part does not require much strength

00:10:06.925 --> 00:10:09.492
each of their movement holds Marina breathless 

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:14.196
followed by their safe landing on an intermediate position, they have to go further down 

00:10:14.388 --> 00:10:17.556
Zoe's heart almost falls out during this part of the mission 

00:10:17.796 --> 00:10:22.500
when she tries to open the door, the door is swung open, and its handle flies off her hand

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:26.580
fortunately, Zoe is not injured, and she manages to go in safely 

00:10:26.724 --> 00:10:30.900
according to Marina's instruction, Zoe measures the pressure of various pipes 

00:10:30.996 --> 00:10:33.204
and confirms that they are filled with oxygen 

00:10:33.396 --> 00:10:36.564
David then assists Zoe in filling cylinders with oxygen 

00:10:36.804 --> 00:10:39.924
when they are filling the second cylinder, an emergency breaks out 

00:10:40.325 --> 00:10:44.484
a high energy solar flare coming towards them triggers the alarm 

00:10:44.628 --> 00:10:47.220
Marina commands them to come back immediately 

00:10:47.316 --> 00:10:51.588
so Zoe departs the place before she can fill the second cylinder to the full 

00:10:51.684 --> 00:10:55.092
on their way back, Zoe loses her balance and falls down 

00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:59.796
as a result, she loses the oxygen cylinder, which is fully filled 

00:10:59.988 --> 00:11:03.492
although they return to the space station before the solar flare arrives

00:11:03.588 --> 00:11:06.276
they do not bring back much oxygen supply 

00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:10.356
the one cylinder they take back contains very little amount of oxygen 

00:11:10.596 --> 00:11:12.852
