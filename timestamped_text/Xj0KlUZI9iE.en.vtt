00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:02.790
Welcome to Movie Shortens.

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.009
Follow us today to a movie titled: Half light.

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.490
Be aware, there are spoilers!

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:13.440
In a small house in London located near a
canal, we meet Rachel Carlson, an American

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.570
murder mystery novelist.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.300
Rachel lives with her second husband Brian,
who works as a book editor, and her 5-year-old

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.859
son Thomas.

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:26.339
Brian has returned home and has received an
email, it’s a rejection letter from a publishing

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:29.750
company about his future book Fade Away.

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.940
Rachel doesn't pay much attention to Brian
and instead focuses on typing.

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.820
Thomas wants his mom’s attention, so he
drives his toy car right into her foot.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.080
Thomas then tells her that it's time to go
outside, with his mom telling him that she

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.440
needs a little more time.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.150
He heads outside on his own as he can't wait
any longer.

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.070
Brian comes into the room a minute later and
shares his news with her.

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.210
Rachel says that they also rejected her first
book too and continues working.

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.070
Meanwhile, Thomas opens the gate that leads
to the Canal.

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.079
He walks down and begins playing with the
water.

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:05.449
Rachel begins to call for Thomas but she doesn’t
hear back from him.

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:07.750
She then discovers the gate is wide open.

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.450
She heads down the stairs to the canal and
continues calling out to her son.

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.470
She then sees his action figure floating in
the water next to a wooden boat.

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.580
She moves the boat out of the way, only to
make the unfortunate discovery that her son

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.430
has drowned.

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.860
Fast forward eight months, Rachel is driving
to the coastal region of Scotland looking

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:26.940
for a new home.

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.299
She blames herself for the death of Thomas,
and due to her inability to reconcile his

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:34.300
passing, she can no longer finish her book.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.070
The tragedy has also put a tremendous burden
on her marriage.

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.570
She has fallen out of love with her husband,
and Brian is asking if they should divorce.

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.200
Though she did not commit to the idea, she
says they should deal with it later.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.130
Rachel’s attitude towards Brian has changed,
as she has put all the blame on him, accusing

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:52.950
him of leaving the gate open.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.830
He is tired of her non-stop thinking about
Thomas, and also being labeled as the one

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:58.850
at fault.

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.500
She eventually settles on a house on the coast,
all by itself, the only thing in its line

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.040
of sight being a lighthouse on an island far
away from her.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.420
She calls her friend Sharon to tell her about
the house's location, letting her know she

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:12.810
will be fine.

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:18.630
She walks around and discovers neighbors along
the way, Finlay Murray and his wife Mary Murphy

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.319
who point her to the town.

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:24.740
As she arrives, a lone woman sitting on a
bench named Morag tells her that her son is

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.950
waiting for her on the swings.

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:32.040
Rachel questions whose son, but Morag backs
off and claims mistaken identity.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.349
Leaving town, she heads to a beach and gets
a boat to the lighthouse.

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:39.540
She explores the island, taking photos of
the horses that roam the area.

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.900
Making her last stop to take a picture of
the lighthouse.

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:49.160
Just then, a man named Angus spooks her unintentionally,
only to remark that the lighthouse is impressive.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.010
He lets her know that they should become friends
since they are now neighbors, and she agrees

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.450
that they should.

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.099
Later that night, as she is going through
Thomas’ belongings, she finds a cryptic

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:02.870
message, saying to look behind her, which
makes her feel uneasy.

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.690
When she turns around, she sees her own reflection
in the mirror, scaring herself and dropping

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:08.940
the sketch.

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.970
Upon picking it back up, the message has vanished.

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.870
The next night, she suddenly sees Thomas outside
on the dock by her house.

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.560
She rushes to hug him, and tells him not to
go.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.129
He then tells her to come and be with him.

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:27.090
Puzzled turns to paniced as Thomas pulls her
into the water and attempts to drown her.

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.700
She wakes up in a panic and it turns out to
be just a bad dream.

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.170
Slowly catching her breath, she looks over
and sees Thomas standing next to her again.

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:40.090
He lunges at her neck, she wakes up again.

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:45.020
Another day passes, and she has now decided
that she needs a break from typing to go and

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:46.280
see Angus.

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.840
Getting a tour of the place, she learns that
Angus lives by himself.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.280
Angus, his father, and his grandfather all
have lived in that lighthouse, so he could

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.800
never leave.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:00.099
He takes Rachel to the top and sees the horizon
in all its magnificence.

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:04.459
Rachel gives Angus one of her books and departs
from the island looking much happier than

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:05.459
before.

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:09.690
Some time has started to go by, Angus and
Rachel spend more time with each other.

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.690
Walking on the beach, riding horses, and just
enjoying his company.

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:19.180
Rachel shares about her enjoyable experiences
and life by the waves with Angus with Sharon.

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.780
One day, she and Angus decide to take a photo
by some ruins on the island.

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:28.610
At first, Rachel is joyful, but after the
shutter and flash go off, she starts flashing

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:31.210
back to the time she was with her son.

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:36.620
She snaps back out of it when Angus notices
her still frozen, asking her if she is alright.

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.550
She only tells him that she needs to get back,
and that she is sorry.

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:45.460
Sometime later she is at a local bar, alone
and zoning out, when Morag approaches and

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.730
mentions about the gate, which Rachel left
open.

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:53.190
Morag informs her that Thomas is trying to
follow her, still dripping wet, and attempting

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:54.580
to hold her hand.

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.130
All these words from Morag cause Rachel to
drop her glass.

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:02.740
Finlay helps her clean the glass and tells
her to disregard what Morag says, accusing

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.680
her of being an attention seeker.

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:09.900
At home, she finds another cryptic message
written with the alphabets on her refrigerator.

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.400
Terrified, she comes to see Angus.

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:17.750
Stares lead to caressing, leading to a kiss,
and then an embrace.

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:21.670
Finally feeling better about her life, she
goes to a birthday party for Mary.

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:24.280
She asks Mary if she has seen Angus yet.

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.850
Her question surprises everyone there.

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:31.030
Mary tells her that Angus and his wife Kate
died 7 years before.

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:35.280
Everyone else at the party confirms the reality,
leading Rachel to go mad.

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.030
She starts to think Angus might have never
been alive.

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:41.920
Upon leaving the party and going back to the
lighthouse, Finlay tells her that Kate had

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:43.490
an affair with a fisherman.

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:48.070
In the rage and chaos of finding out, Angus
shoved her into the furnace, killing her.

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:52.610
Angus killed the fisherman by impaling him
with a hook, hoisting him up, then he jumped

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:54.380
from the top of the lighthouse.

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:58.800
She looks for evidence that he is alive, even
calling Sharon and talking to her about it.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.930
She tells her that Angus must have been her
imagination.

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:05.070
Worried for Rachel, Sharon decides to come
to her to take her home.

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:09.320
Disbelieving what is happening, Rachel goes
back to the lighthouse and climbs to the top

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:11.539
as she thought she saw Angus up there.

00:06:11.539 --> 00:06:14.450
Just as Rachel gets to the top, Sharon arrives.

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:17.660
Rachel comes back down and tells her to imagine
Angus away.

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:21.139
Rachel sees Angus behind Sharon and tells
her to turn around.

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:25.550
Even forcing her to turn around to see Angus,
but Sharon doesn’t see him.

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:28.730
Turning her back to Angus, he stabs Sharon
to death.

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:32.970
Rachel goes to Finlay for help, but when they
get back, Sharon’s body is gone.

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:37.900
Worried she has imagined it all, Rachel then
calls her friend Robert to go check on Sharon.

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:42.259
Robert then calls Brian and tells him that
he thinks something is wrong with Rachel.

00:06:42.259 --> 00:06:45.710
unbeknownst to Robert, Brian is already in
Rachel's house.

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:49.550
We then see Sharon, very much alive, meet
up with Angus at a bar.

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:54.050
It is revealed that Sharon and Brian have
decided to kill Rachel, and “Angus” is

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:55.250
a part of it.

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:59.280
Brian’s reason is for the money she has,
and Sharon because of her envy.

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:04.009
Angus is actually a man named Patrick and
is warned better not to have fallen for Rachel,

00:07:04.009 --> 00:07:06.370
or his whole life may have collapsed.

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:10.889
Before leaving town, Patrick recalls throwing
the film from Rachels camera behind the ruins

00:07:10.889 --> 00:07:15.419
and goes to wipe out any other existence of
him ever being there.

00:07:15.419 --> 00:07:18.770
Alone at home, Rachel thinks she hears something
outside her house.

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:22.220
She investigates, and initially thinks she
is mistaken.

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:26.300
Turns out Brian is still there and comes from
behind her and puts her to sleep.

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:30.680
Patrick, now with the camera reel, looks to
leave the island, but is stopped when he starts

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:32.220
thinking about Rachel.

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:36.350
He ventures back to the lighthouse, but to
his horror, something attacks him.

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:41.319
At the same time, Morag goes and warns Finlay
about Rachel, and is convinced by Mary to

00:07:41.319 --> 00:07:42.530
go investigate.

00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:47.419
Now Rachel has been taken on a boat crewed
by Brian and Sharon, and Brian is close to

00:07:47.419 --> 00:07:50.360
throwing her overboard with an anchor around
her feet.

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:54.470
Just before he does, the lighthouse starts
emitting light, and both don’t realize Rachel

00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:55.849
is reawakening.

00:07:55.849 --> 00:08:00.190
Before she can grab the key to undo the lock
around her leg, Brian pushes her.

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:04.340
She is able to hang onto the boat for a bit,
before being pushed overboard.

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:07.889
Struggling in the water, Rachel cannot undo
the lock to the anchor.

00:08:07.889 --> 00:08:11.410
Before she passes out, she hears Thomas' words
showing her the key.

00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:14.539
When she does, she sees the key that can free
her.

00:08:14.539 --> 00:08:16.930
She surfaces and heads to shore.

00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:20.550
Both Sharon and Brian have gone into the lighthouse
looking for Patrick, thinking he turned on

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:25.410
the lights, only to be confronted by Rachel
who has found a flare gun.

00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:29.750
She tells Brian to tie himself up but ends
up in a struggle with Sharon.

00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:34.099
Misfiring the flare inside, Brian attacks
Rachel, but the impact of his spirit sends

00:08:34.099 --> 00:08:36.349
Sharon into the furnace, killing her.

00:08:36.349 --> 00:08:40.419
Brian follows Rachel up the stairs of the
light house but is stopped by Patrick.

00:08:40.419 --> 00:08:44.600
However, he denies being Patrick, and stabs
Brian with a hook chain.

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:48.940
Patrick then goes to the top of the light
house, stares down Rachel then places the

00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:52.970
seashell in her hand, and jumps off the top
to his death.

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:57.949
All three have mirrored the way Kate, the
Fisherman, and Angus died in the past.

00:08:57.949 --> 00:09:00.699
Some time has passed, and the conspiracy has
become public.

00:09:00.699 --> 00:09:06.319
At Rachel’s house, Finlay tells Rachel he
will keep people off the island to let Angus’s

00:09:06.319 --> 00:09:07.319
spirit rest.

00:09:07.319 --> 00:09:11.600
Morag gives her a last piece of advice, and
tells Rachel to let go of Thomas’s death.

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:14.470
They hug it out, and Rachel leaves her house.

00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:18.160
She then goes back to her original house at
the beginning of the story and sits in the

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:22.470
same place she had when she took the picture
with her son.

00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:26.639
Rachel finally comes to peace with that day.
