00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:04.480
Welcome back for another 5 minute movie recap.

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.920
Today, I'm going to give you an&nbsp;
overview of the 2021 American&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.960
military science fiction action&nbsp;
film called 'The Tomorrow War'.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.800
The film is directed by Chris&nbsp;
McKay and starring Chris Pratt.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.280
It follows a group of current&nbsp;
day troops and citizens who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.560
are transported into the future to&nbsp;
combat an extraterrestrial army.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.200
Warning: there will be spoilers&nbsp;
ahead, so please proceed with caution.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.560
Dan Forester, a biology&nbsp;
teacher and former Green Beret,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.040
is unable to secure a position at a&nbsp;
prominent research facility in December 2022.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.800
During the World Cup broadcast, warriors from the&nbsp;
year 2051 appear to warn that mankind is on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:44.160
verge of extinction due to a conflict with alien&nbsp;
invaders known as 'Whitespikes.' The Whitespikes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.000
will arrive in November 2048 and destroy the vast&nbsp;
bulk of mankind within three years. As a result,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.080
the world's military are transported into the&nbsp;
future through a wormhole technology known as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:59.440
the 'Jumplink,' but only around 20% survive their&nbsp;
seven-day deployment, forcing a worldwide draught.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.160
Dan receives notification that he has been&nbsp;
selected, and when he tells his wife, she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:09.200
advises him to flee and persuades him to contact&nbsp;
his estranged father, a mechanical engineer, for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.080
assistance in removing the draught band connected&nbsp;
to his arm. Dan's father abandoned him and his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.320
mother when he returned from Vietnam because he&nbsp;
believed it was too unsafe to stay with them, but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.760
Dan refuses his assistance and labels him a coward&nbsp;
before leaving. Dan reports to basic training with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:28.880
the other draftees, where they are briefed about&nbsp;
the Whitespikes by future warriors. Dan and fellow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.760
draftee Charlie determine that, in order to avoid&nbsp;
a contradiction, those conscripted have already&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.000
perished before the war begins, but those who have&nbsp;
arrived from the future have not yet been born.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.080
The draftees are sent ahead in time&nbsp;
to a battlefield on Miami Beach,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.280
but few survive after being dropped high over&nbsp;
the city by mistake. Colonel Forester, Romeo&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.160
Commander, directs the draftees to save adjacent&nbsp;
lab employees before the area is sterilised.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.960
They realise that the lab staff have already&nbsp;
died, but they are able to salvage their research.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.880
When Dan informs leadership about&nbsp;
the situation, he is informed that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.760
no assistance would be dispatched to rescue&nbsp;
the stranded men. Except for Charlie, Dan,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.400
and Dorian, a battle-hardened soldier on his&nbsp;
third mission to the future, nearly everyone dies.

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:16.320
The survivors awaken at a Dominican Republic&nbsp;
military base. Dan reports to Colonel Forester,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:21.120
who happens to be his grown daughter Muri. She&nbsp;
asks him to accompany her on a mission to catch&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.400
a female Whitespike, which are more uncommon than&nbsp;
males. They capture and imprison the female only&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.840
to have hundreds of men descend on their location.&nbsp;
As the helicopter carrying the female takes off,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.440
Dan and Muri flee to a beach and call for help.&nbsp;
Muri discloses to Dan that after losing his work,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:43.040
he abandons his family and dies in a vehicle&nbsp;
accident in 2030. Dan, Muri, and the female&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.200
Whitespike are brought to a guarded oil rig&nbsp;
near Port Nelson, which houses the Jumplink.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.480
Muri develops a poison capable of killing&nbsp;
Whitespikes. To liberate the female, the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.680
Whitespikes attack and overrun the facility, and&nbsp;
Muri sacrifices herself to send Dan back in time.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.520
Despite the fact that he&nbsp;
returns to 2023 with the poison,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.040
the Jumplink is destroyed. The&nbsp;
destruction of the Jumplink is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.800
interpreted by the rest of the globe as a&nbsp;
sign that the future battle has been lost.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.080
While Dan and his wife, Emmy, are brainstorming,&nbsp;
she deduces that the Whitespikes did not come in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:19.680
2048, but much earlier. Dan talks with Charlie&nbsp;
and Martin, a high school student interested&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.600
in volcanoes, and they hypothesise that the&nbsp;
Whitespikes have been on Earth since at least&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.960
the 'Millennium Eruption' in 946, and that global&nbsp;
warming has forced them to thaw up and emerge from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:34.560
beneath the ice caps. Dan organises a trip to&nbsp;
Russia with Charlie, Dorian, a few surviving&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.120
future soldiers, and his estranged father James to&nbsp;
take things into their own hands when the United&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.920
States Defense Secretary rejects to utilise&nbsp;
military resources to verify the hypothesis.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.440
The team discovers a wrecked extraterrestrial&nbsp;
ship in Komsomolets Island's Academy of Sciences&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.640
Glacier. They consider informing the rest of the&nbsp;
world about the situation, but ultimately opt to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.760
eliminate the threat themselves. Once inside, they&nbsp;
learn that the Whitespikes are not aliens, but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.240
rather bio-engineered creatures that may have been&nbsp;
employed as a planet-clearing weapon or livestock&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:09.760
by another alien civilization. The crew injects&nbsp;
the poison into five hibernating Whitespikes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.240
which kills the injected ones but awakens the rest&nbsp;
of the colony, killing the majority of the squad.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.360
Dorian, who is dying of cancer and wants to&nbsp;
die on his own terms, remains behind to blow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:24.560
up the ship with C-4, killing all but one of&nbsp;
the Whitespikes. Dan and his father track down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.800
and murder the lone female fugitive, leaving&nbsp;
them and Charlie as the team's only survivors.

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.240
Dan brings James home to&nbsp;
meet his wife and children,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.840
content that the conflict has been&nbsp;
avoided and mankind has been preserved,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.600
resolved not to repeat the same mistakes that&nbsp;
Muri had warned him about from her future.
