00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.360
Welcome back to Movie Recapped.&nbsp;
Today I will show you an action,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:09.440
horror, sci-fi film from 2016, titled Kill&nbsp;
Command. Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.&nbsp;

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.480
In an advanced near future, we meet Katherine&nbsp;
Mills, a cyborg working for the Harbinger&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.880
Corporation. She's working at the factory when she&nbsp;
gets a sudden message delivered directed to her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.840
mind: it's footage of the robot known as S.A.R. or&nbsp;
Study Analyze Reprogram, having an anomaly at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.800
Harbinger I Training Facility. She reports this to&nbsp;
her boss, explaining that there's been a reprogram&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.840
count: one and a half million just under one day,&nbsp;
totally unprecedented. Her boss congratulates her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.720
on it.We then cut to a military base, where&nbsp;
Captain Damien Bukes is asking one of his men,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.280
Drifter, for a report. He informs him they've been&nbsp;
ordered to join a training exercise and that it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.080
pretty rotten out there. Bukes isn't happy with&nbsp;
this news so, after noticing Mills sitting nearby,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.000
he approaches the soldier in charge of sending&nbsp;
them off to ask what's going on since his team has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
already been on training the last four times out,&nbsp;
he's told is only two days and they're looking for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.280
marines with combat time, not many left of those.&nbsp;
Bukes has no other choice but to obey, but before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.840
he leaves, he's informed he's been assigned Mills&nbsp;
as a tech. She follows Bukes outside to introduce&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.600
herself and explain there's hardware on the field&nbsp;
they'll be training at, she'll be observing it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.760
since she is from Harbinger. Bukes asks her to&nbsp;
keep an eye on them, she says she must keep an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.360
eye on both them and the hardware, which makes&nbsp;
Bukes believe she's trying to work out what she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.760
can save on. She explains that's not what her&nbsp;
company does, they're vendors for the military,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.400
not the military itself. Bukes cuts her off and&nbsp;
tells her to keep up or she'll be left behind,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.080
he also asks her to turn her eyes scanner&nbsp;
off because he doesn't want to be scanned.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.920
But Mills tells him it doesn't go off.
Once they board the plane, Mills meets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.880
Bukes' whole unit, which consists of Drifter,&nbsp;
Sergeant Rory Robinson, Corporal Robert Cutbill,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.920
Lance Corporal Martin Goodwin, Corporal Daniella&nbsp;
Hackett and Corporal Sam Loftus. The plan takes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.080
off and the crew keeps themselves busy on the&nbsp;
trip: some of them sleep or do a crossword,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.920
Mills learns about them by scanning them but also&nbsp;
by hearing their banter - they're quite obviously&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.720
very close friends. She also learns that Bukes&nbsp;
has killed 18 and that Robinson has tech implants&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.200
on his eyes. Robinson points his rifle at her&nbsp;
and tells her he sees her, Mills just leans in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.200
a bit and disarms the weapon by just looking at&nbsp;
it, since that's all she needs to do to access&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.360
any machine. She points out she can even fire&nbsp;
it from afar while he's checking the chamber.&nbsp;

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.400
As they get closer to the location, Bukes gives&nbsp;
the unit the basic instructions and reminds them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.800
the ammo is live and they'll be monitored. Mills&nbsp;
discovers she cannot access the global network&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.520
anymore and she's obliged to change to the local&nbsp;
one. Robinson tells Bukes that what she's got are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.520
tools, like the ones on his own eyes, but&nbsp;
Bukes tells him his don't go to his brain.&nbsp;

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.680
The plane lands in front of an old facility, the&nbsp;
door opens when the lock's computer recognizes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.360
Bukes. The computer also turns on the&nbsp;
lights and repeats a welcome message,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.520
but as Bukes makes his way inside, he&nbsp;
realizes there's nobody around. This is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:44.320
also noted outside by the soldiers, who wonder&nbsp;
who will be monitoring them. When Bukes returns,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.480
he tells them they'll get going, and Mills takes&nbsp;
the chance to ask him if he has any ground support&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.960
or recon - he doesn't. Mills thinks they got&nbsp;
off on the wrong foot, but he doesn't agree.&nbsp;

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.280
The plane leaves and the team makes their way&nbsp;
through the facility while teasing each other,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.520
eventually they make it out and into a forest.&nbsp;
Bukes orders Cutbill to send up a drone then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.840
reminds everyone they shouldn't let their guards&nbsp;
down just because it's training. Once the drone is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.160
set up, they get going, spreading out with Mills&nbsp;
following behind after she sees an unidentified&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.560
drone among the trees. It doesn't take them long&nbsp;
to find the location, so they move to get into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.840
their positions, with Drifter following Mills&nbsp;
and asking her to help him out with his boss.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.240
Their conversation is interrupted when three&nbsp;
strange surveillance drones arrive and stare&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.480
at them, Drifter is about to aim at them but Mills&nbsp;
stops him - it seems she's trying to gain access&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.880
to them. Drifter informs his teammates of this&nbsp;
encounter, Hackett reports she's found them too.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.880
Mills tells Drifter Harbinger made what he&nbsp;
calls these "new toys" but these ones have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.360
been quantum-modified, they don't have operators.&nbsp;
After Drifter comments on the fact they at least&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.280
know they're here, we see Bukes has also found&nbsp;
these drones, but asks everyone to move on.&nbsp;

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.800
Moments later, their practice targets finally make&nbsp;
an appearance: they're very rudimentary robots.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:53.120
Bukes designs a plan of attack and everybody moves&nbsp;
to their assigned positions, Mills once again&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:58.000
getting to follow Drifter after one more glance at&nbsp;
the special drone. After a countdown, they attack&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.200
using bullets, rockets and explosives - a piece of&nbsp;
cake for experienced soldiers like them. The weird&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.520
drones watch and record their tactics, and Mills&nbsp;
decides to follow one deeper in the forest where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:12.080
she finds a more advanced unit, a S.A.R. She isn't&nbsp;
surprised to see it, but she does get shocked when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.560
it turns around and there's blood on its head -&nbsp;
the fact she can't access it also upsets her. She&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.480
does manage to see and download some footage from&nbsp;
the robot, which contains images of it shooting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:25.520
people face to face. She closes her eyes, trying&nbsp;
to process all this, and when she opens them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.480
the S.A.R. is nowhere to be found. At that moment&nbsp;
a message arrives from their captain: the day is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:35.280
over, they've done well, time to set up camp.
Later at night, the team has set up camp and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.600
is sharing some war stories, but Mills sits&nbsp;
on her own. Drifter can't help watching her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.800
and the others tease him for it,&nbsp;
reminding him she isn't even human.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.440
They also discuss the fact their targets were easy&nbsp;
to get and rather basic technology. Meanwhile,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.360
Mills is going through the footage she's acquired&nbsp;
when Drifter comes to check on her. He sits&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.680
by her side and asks her where she had gone&nbsp;
earlier, she only says she had to look around.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:00.240
He also asks about communications, but just&nbsp;
like them, she can't still reach out either. She&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.640
wonders why Bukes isn't talking to him himself,&nbsp;
Drifter points out maybe Bukes simply chooses not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:08.400
to like her, which Mills thinks it's unfortunate&nbsp;
for her considering Bukes' killing record,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.720
but Drifter says those are context-less figures,&nbsp;
and that's why Bukes doesn't want to like her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:16.480
Drifter takes the chance to asked Mills about the&nbsp;
story behind her getting chipped: it happened when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:21.760
she was eleven, and without it she had paralysis.&nbsp;
Harbinger sponsored it all and cured her. Drifter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:26.720
decides to return to camp a moment later, where he&nbsp;
finds Bukes staring at Mills. He asks Drifter if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:30.800
she's told him anything, he replies she's said&nbsp;
she's been blocked off and doesn't know why.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.720
Drifter believes her, but Bukes doesn't: he thinks&nbsp;
something's off with both the training and Mills.&nbsp;

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.880
While everyone gets ready for the night,&nbsp;
Mills detects a bunch of drones in the forest,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.720
and when she goes to sleep, the strange footage&nbsp;
from the S.A.R. appears in her eyes again.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:47.440
Meanwhile, Loftus -who is staying up to keep&nbsp;
watch- is approached by one of the drones.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.480
He tells it to get out of there and&nbsp;
it does, but then he hears a noise:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:55.360
when he looks up with this gun light, he finds the&nbsp;
S.A.R. coming after him. Loftus starts shooting at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:59.040
it but we suddenly cut back to camp, where Mills&nbsp;
wakes up to hear everyone wondering about the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:04.160
unexpected shot noises. Goodwin tells Bukes he saw&nbsp;
Loftus up there but a second later he was gone, so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:08.400
the team starts searching the forest to find him.
It's already the morning of the second day when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:12.240
they find their first clue: some blood on&nbsp;
the grass. It only takes them a few steps&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:16.560
more from there to find Loftus' body, chucked&nbsp;
against a tree. Cutbill freaks out at the sight&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:20.080
of his friend like this and wants to get out&nbsp;
of there, his superiors tell him to shut up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:23.840
as they all get in a defensive position&nbsp;
for a possible attack. Mills tells them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:27.280
they're standing on their targets' area from&nbsp;
yesterday when a drone comes by to watch them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:31.040
the thing barely stays there a second before&nbsp;
leaving right before Hackett gets shot and killed.&nbsp;

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:36.160
Bukes orders them to move and they do so, hiding&nbsp;
behind trees as a bunch of robots shows up where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:40.480
the unit took positions the day before, which&nbsp;
Bukes notices. He and Drifter take out some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:44.560
smoke grenades and throw them to cover the&nbsp;
area with fog. Robots and soldiers start&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:48.640
shooting at each other as the unit keeps moving&nbsp;
along, Bukes eventually manages to get closer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:52.880
to the robots but they strangely back off and&nbsp;
disappear when they see him. In the meantime,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:57.040
Cutbill -who got separated from his team on&nbsp;
the run- is trying to contact them to no avail.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:00.880
A couple of drones come closer to watch&nbsp;
him before flying away, only for a S.A.R.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:05.280
to come out a moment later and kill Cutbill.
Back to the team, Drifter asks Bukes what he's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:09.520
seen. He explains the robots he's encountered&nbsp;
are more advanced than those from yesterday,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:13.760
their armor is incredibly good since they were&nbsp;
able to take a shot from him without any damage.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:17.520
Getting angry over losing his men, he demands&nbsp;
Mills to tell him what she knows and to turn&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:21.760
those robots off. Mills says that while she's&nbsp;
able to see them, she isn't capable of turning&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:26.240
them off - there's a programming error and she's&nbsp;
running the possibilities. This gets Bukes even&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:30.480
angrier, but Drifter jumps in to defend her,&nbsp;
saying she doesn't know and this is a programmer's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:35.520
mistake. Bukes doesn't agree: mistakes aren't&nbsp;
efficient. Robinson returns then - he had been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:40.160
looking for Cutbill, but only found his helmet.&nbsp;
So the team gets moving again to find him.&nbsp;

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:44.160
On their way through the forest, Drifter reminds&nbsp;
Bukes Mills is useful because she can see things&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:48.000
they can't. Bukes points out that if she sees&nbsp;
them that means they get to see her in return&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.360
and therefore they see the team as well, but&nbsp;
Drifter says it doesn't matter because they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:55.120
need all the help they can take right now.&nbsp;
Bukes can't stop thinking about the attack&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:58.880
and wondering why the robots have let them walk,&nbsp;
he thinks it may be because Mills was there with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:03.360
them. She interrupts them to show them something&nbsp;
in the forest: a huge amount of dead animals,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:08.480
it seems the robots have been using them as target&nbsp;
practice, like Loftus. Suddenly, Mills announces&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:12.880
they're being tracked from the ridge, just in time&nbsp;
to see more robots show up. They waste no time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:17.200
in opening fire, so the team starts running&nbsp;
away as fast as they can. When a particular&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:20.880
shot is about to hit Mills, Bukes pushes her&nbsp;
out of the way and drags her down with him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:25.760
which causes them to roll away and get separated&nbsp;
from the group. Mills hits a tree and passes out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:30.000
Drifter tries to contact them to no avail, so&nbsp;
he tells Goodwin and Robinson to get moving.&nbsp;

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:35.440
Night falls. Bukes manages to carry Mills back&nbsp;
to the facility entrance and make contact with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:39.360
Drifter. They tell each other of their situation&nbsp;
and when Drifter says they'll go to him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:43.520
Bukes orders them to stay where they are - it's&nbsp;
too dark and the robots could find them easily,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:48.880
better regroup in the morning. Some hours later, a&nbsp;
drone appears in front of Bukes. It leaves quickly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:53.440
but the captain is already grabbing Mills and&nbsp;
hiding behind the wall as a S.A.R approaches them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:57.280
The robot leans in and makes Mills open her&nbsp;
eyes to connect with her before leaving.&nbsp;

00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:01.440
It's morning when she finally wakes up. Bukes&nbsp;
informs her she's been out for nine hours,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:05.440
she asks him why he didn't leave her. Bukes&nbsp;
says he doesn't know before telling her about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:09.920
what happened last night, Mills replies they&nbsp;
need to find that robot. When Bukes asks why,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:14.000
she says she can't explain it. Bukes orders her&nbsp;
to find a way before declaring they're leaving.&nbsp;

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:18.080
They regroup with the three remaining&nbsp;
soldiers. Drifter says they weren't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:20.960
tracked even if they could've done so&nbsp;
easily, because they were everywhere&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:25.040
last night. Mills confirms it looks clear&nbsp;
ahead and all the signals are behind them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:28.880
They decide to go back to the drop point and wait&nbsp;
for transport to pick them up, Bukes will take&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:32.560
Mills to the door since she's the only one that&nbsp;
can open it, while the others cover their backs.&nbsp;

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:37.040
The road is clear so they make it to the&nbsp;
door with no issues. Bukes tries to get in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:41.440
but the lock's computer doesn't identify him, and&nbsp;
surveillance drones make their appearance then.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:45.520
Mills takes over the door, working on hacking&nbsp;
it open, when suddenly some smoke grenades are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:50.720
shot in the area: the robots are copying them, and&nbsp;
Bukes can't see a thing. There's no time to plan,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:54.880
the robots appear and start shooting them,&nbsp;
so the soldiers get moving. Drifter is shot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:59.360
on the leg right before Mills manages to open&nbsp;
the door. The soldiers need to stop and hide to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:04.080
protect themselves from the heavy fire, so Bukes&nbsp;
decides to go help them. They all hold onto each&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:08.640
other as they get moving again, but Drifter says&nbsp;
back, shooting to give them a chance to escape.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:13.600
He gets shot again, so the S.A.R. finds him and&nbsp;
pins him down. Bukes notices this and goes back to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:19.040
save him. Mills also notices so she runs and joins&nbsp;
them, the robots stop shooting when they see her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:23.840
She tries to deactivate them but she can't, so&nbsp;
the S.A.R. gets in position to cut Drifter open.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:27.600
Mills is still trying to deactivate the&nbsp;
units so she tells the soldiers not to shoot,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:31.920
but since she isn't getting anywhere, Bukes shoots&nbsp;
Drifter before the S.A.R can kill him itself to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:36.320
save him from the torture. Mills cries out at the&nbsp;
loss of her friend, Bukes grabs her and drags her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:41.040
with him as they finally enter the facility again.
Inside the building, Mills yells at Bukes for what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:45.520
he did. She's sure she could've saved Drifter&nbsp;
because she was the one that made these robots.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:50.320
This makes no sense, so the soldiers point their&nbsp;
weapons at her and demand answers. Mills says she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:54.880
doesn't know why they are here, marines come here&nbsp;
to train but she only knows they were requested.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:58.880
She's the one that wrote the program and designed&nbsp;
the prototypes, but the codes have advanced more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:02.640
than they could imagine. She thinks that if&nbsp;
she can understand it, she could control it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:06.800
but Bukes says it's too late for that. When&nbsp;
asked exactly what they are, Mills tells them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:10.640
they're their replacements, machines taking&nbsp;
over human soldiers so no more lives are lost.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:15.920
They learn and improve themselves, like people.&nbsp;
None of the soldiers like this, and Bukes points&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:19.760
out his men are dead because of her. Mills is&nbsp;
shown to be crying when he leaves the room.&nbsp;

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:24.000
The main door is slowly being cut open by&nbsp;
the robots, so they need to find a better&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.560
defensive position. Mills gets the door to the&nbsp;
personnel area open and turns on the lights,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:33.680
what they find inside is worrying: a whole unit&nbsp;
of S.A.R. models. Bukes tells Mills not to turn&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:37.760
them on, then asks her to open a new door:&nbsp;
here they find the bodies of all the facility&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:42.080
employees. Mills uses a screen to connect to&nbsp;
the local system, but she still can't manage to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:46.080
communicate with the outside world. Bukes points&nbsp;
out they're in a bottleneck and they could slow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:51.040
down the robots from here. As the soldiers start&nbsp;
setting up charges, Mills leaves the room, locking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:55.680
the door behind her so they can't follow her.
Since the S.A.R. units have power, she activates&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:55.680 --> 00:12:00.560
one. They are all connected to each other, so when&nbsp;
one wakes up, it will know what they all know.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:05.040
She thinks she can get to them through this one.&nbsp;
The robot wakes up and, after Mills turns on its&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:10.000
speech program, it starts answering her questions.&nbsp;
Its orders are to run the human combat program,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.480
which Mills tries to cancel, but she can't. It&nbsp;
tells her it can't comply because of a human&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:19.200
error: the training subjects aren't performing&nbsp;
as expected, so they need new motivated targets.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:22.480
As the robot identifies who she is and&nbsp;
the fact she doesn't have clearance,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:26.480
Mills has a realization: it was the guardian&nbsp;
S.A.R. that brought the marines here.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:31.280
When she asks when training will be complete, the&nbsp;
robot says it's unspecified. The soldiers tell&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:35.040
Mills to open the door but she doesn't listen,&nbsp;
she wants to try to access the units again.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:39.920
She isn't successful, and the guardian S.A.R&nbsp;
starts activating the rest of the robots at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:44.640
same time the ones from the outside finally break&nbsp;
in. Mills is being approached from all sides,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:49.200
but Robinson manages to force the door open&nbsp;
and drags her inside before closing it again.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:51.920
The robots immediately get on&nbsp;
working to cut this one open too.&nbsp;

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:56.800
The team returns to the bottleneck room, where&nbsp;
Bukes is finishing setting up the charges.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:01.200
The robots break in then, so they barely have time&nbsp;
to escape before the bomb goes off, hitting them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:06.080
as well. When they are down, Mills is hit again&nbsp;
by an electromagnetic disturbance, making her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:10.800
notice the robots carry EMP grenades with them.&nbsp;
They all make it outside, where they find many&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:15.440
abandoned buildings and training equipment, plus&nbsp;
more bodies. While the soldiers look at the ruins,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:20.080
Mills enters a tunnel and takes an EMP grenade&nbsp;
from one of the fallen robots. Afterward,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:23.920
while the men divide the ammunition and take a&nbsp;
position for a siege, she looks over the footage&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:27.840
of the death of her teammates, which makes her&nbsp;
cry but also more determined to use the grenade.&nbsp;

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:32.560
While everyone waits for the robots, Bukes&nbsp;
checks on Mills and discovers the grenade.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:36.480
Mills tells him it should be able to deactivate&nbsp;
the S.A.R., but its range is short, they'll&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:40.560
need a detonator. Hitting the S.A.R. leader&nbsp;
should stop all the rest of the units as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:44.560
She also explains that the reason why they&nbsp;
haven't been killed yet is that the robots have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:49.280
pushed them there on purpose for more practice,&nbsp;
only the EMP can stop them. Bukes points out the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:53.520
explosion may kill her too, or at least wipe her&nbsp;
clean, but Mills thinks it's their only option.&nbsp;

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:58.000
They spend the entire night waiting, and it&nbsp;
isn't until morning that the robots finally come.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:01.680
Robinson is in charge of drawing them&nbsp;
in from this spot as sharpshooter,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:06.000
Goodwin must stay out of sight because he has&nbsp;
the detonators. When the units enter the city,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.840
Robinson and Burkes start a gunfight with them&nbsp;
while Mills scans the area to indicate Goodwin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:13.600
when to trigger the bombs they've hidden, which&nbsp;
manage to make them lose quite a few robots.&nbsp;

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:17.360
Mills continues to guide Robinsong&nbsp;
and Burkes safely through the city,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:21.760
warning them of incoming attacks, but when Goodwin&nbsp;
activates another bomb, the drones find him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:26.080
so he must leave his assigned spot. Robinson&nbsp;
covers Burkes as he runs to help Goodwin,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:30.400
who is being chased by a S.A.R. He manages to&nbsp;
grab him and take him, Robinson dies covering&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:34.960
their backs. Once they reach a safe stop, Goodwin&nbsp;
mentions he's dropped the detonator on the way,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:38.480
so Bukes goes out under heavy fire to&nbsp;
retrieve it and finds Mills already there,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:43.360
picking it up as the robots come closer. Bukes&nbsp;
tells her to run so she isn't hit by the EMP too,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:47.280
but she refuses. The S.A.R. makes&nbsp;
one of the smaller units shoot Mills,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:51.600
but Bukes catches her as she goes down, giving&nbsp;
her the opportunity to trigger the EMP grenade.&nbsp;

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:56.640
For a moment, it seems all robots have&nbsp;
shut down, and Mills is about to as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:56.640 --> 00:15:01.280
But the S.A.R. suddenly wakes up and goes&nbsp;
after them, so Bukes has to drag Mills away.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:04.800
They enter a building and while Bukes&nbsp;
starts shooting at the robot on the stairs,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:09.760
Mills crawls into the room Robinson's body is at.&nbsp;
Bukes is thrown inside by the robot soon after,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:13.920
and he asks it to finish him, but the S.A.R.&nbsp;
can't because it has orders and still needs more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:18.880
data to complete the program. It goes after Mills&nbsp;
instead, whom it still can't identify, but when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:23.600
it's about to kill her, she activates Robinson's&nbsp;
rifle and shoots the S.A.R. down. The robot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:27.440
connects to her and downloads information into&nbsp;
her brain before finally deactivating for good.&nbsp;

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:30.640
The movie ends with transport&nbsp;
arriving to pick Bukes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:34.240
Goodwin and Mills up and get them out of&nbsp;
there. As the soldiers board the plane,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:37.760
Mills' eyes open, showing us the&nbsp;
S.A.R.'s mission protocol has taken over.
