00:00:08.014 --> 00:00:12.238
today I'll show you a thriller film: "Wrong Turn, the Foundation" 

00:00:12.286 --> 00:00:15.214
spoiler ahead, watch out and take care

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:19.774
Jen and her boyfriend, Darius, decide to go hiking the&nbsp;Appalachian Trail in Virginia

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:24.670
together with two couples, Adam and his girlfriend, Luis and his boyfriend

00:00:24.718 --> 00:00:29.422
on the way to the destination, they had a flat tire, so they pull over to change it

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.694
someone seems to watch them in the woods nearby when they park at the roadside

00:00:33.694 --> 00:00:37.438
after changing the tire, they continue their journey to Virginia

00:00:37.486 --> 00:00:41.230
they stop at a hotel for the night in a tranquil town near the mountain

00:00:41.278 --> 00:00:44.446
an old lady at the reception hears about their hiking plan 

00:00:44.494 --> 00:00:48.046
she warns them not to venture off the marked trail in case of danger

00:00:48.094 --> 00:00:51.550
but Jen and her friends are unwilling to take her words seriously

00:00:51.598 --> 00:00:54.910
after settling their luggage, they go to a bar to relax a bit

00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:58.942
Adam attracts the attention of an old man in the bar because of his big mouth

00:00:59.038 --> 00:01:01.630
the old man discovers they aren't local residents 

00:01:01.678 --> 00:01:04.414
and warns them to be careful when they go hiking

00:01:04.462 --> 00:01:09.118
as the old man is going to leave, Adam's words with sarcasm provoke his anger

00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:13.006
luckily, Jen helps Adam out of trouble with her brilliant ad-lib

00:01:13.006 --> 00:01:15.358
when they go out from the bar to get their car

00:01:15.406 --> 00:01:18.430
they see a furtive shadow of a man hovering by the car

00:01:18.478 --> 00:01:21.598
Adam thinks that must be the old man in the bar

00:01:21.646 --> 00:01:25.342
so he throws the wine bottle in his hand to chase the man away

00:01:25.438 --> 00:01:28.462
the figure however, disappears instantly

00:01:28.606 --> 00:01:31.678
the next morning, Jen goes out jogging in the street

00:01:31.774 --> 00:01:36.814
she briefly meets a strange woman peddler selling handicrafts and a poorly dressed girl

00:01:36.862 --> 00:01:41.998
after exercising, Jen gets back to the hotel and starts the hike with her friends

00:01:42.046 --> 00:01:44.878
the young are so excited to get rid of the city life

00:01:44.926 --> 00:01:47.854
and follow the route to explore the wild nature

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.502
Darius suddenly proposes to adventure a fortress out of the trail

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.822
Jen opposes at first as she thinks of what the old lady said at the hotel

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:00.478
but she doesn't want to disappoint her boyfriend, so she agrees to go eventually

00:02:00.526 --> 00:02:03.598
the group leaves their original route to venture into the woods 

00:02:03.694 --> 00:02:07.054
however, they come across a lot of trouble along their way

00:02:07.102 --> 00:02:10.174
Adam's girlfriend even nearly falls off a cliff

00:02:10.222 --> 00:02:14.206
they wander for several hours but still can't find the fortress

00:02:14.254 --> 00:02:18.190
as they are going to give up, a huge tree trunk suddenly rolls down the hill

00:02:18.238 --> 00:02:20.350
giving no time for them to hide 

00:02:20.446 --> 00:02:25.486
Luis's boyfriend is crushed and killed by the trunk and everyone else gets hurt

00:02:25.534 --> 00:02:28.990
binding up the wound, the remaining friends have to mark the way 

00:02:29.038 --> 00:02:30.862
and get back to find the trail

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.030
however, they lose their mobile signal in the deep forest 

00:02:34.078 --> 00:02:36.046
and the sky is getting gloomy

00:02:36.094 --> 00:02:39.070
lost and distressed, they set up a camp for the night

00:02:39.118 --> 00:02:42.094
at night, Jen wakes up to see a shadow outside their tent

00:02:42.142 --> 00:02:46.750
but she takes it as her illusion as she's too tired and falls into sleep soon

00:02:46.846 --> 00:02:49.006
after a stormy night, the next morning

00:02:49.102 --> 00:02:51.742
the group discovers that Adam's girlfriend is missing

00:02:51.838 --> 00:02:54.046
and their mobile phones are gone as well

00:02:54.094 --> 00:02:57.742
Adam finds out they were actually camping in a cemetery last night

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.198
they search around and notice a plaque dated 1859 

00:03:01.246 --> 00:03:05.374
that is used to commemorate the creation of settlers named "the Foundation"

00:03:05.422 --> 00:03:09.406
Adam worries about his girlfriend and nervously searches for her around

00:03:09.502 --> 00:03:11.566
the others follow to help look for her

00:03:11.614 --> 00:03:15.886
while looking around, Adam and Jen see the poorly dressed girl in the forest

00:03:15.982 --> 00:03:19.438
curious about how a little girl shows up in such a pathless place

00:03:19.534 --> 00:03:24.574
Adam hurries to run after her but is accidentally caught by an iron chain on his foot

00:03:24.622 --> 00:03:29.230
suddenly he is pulled into a cave, where a snake coils itself at the entrance

00:03:29.326 --> 00:03:32.158
the other three friends dare not enter the cave

00:03:32.206 --> 00:03:35.758
so they decide to mark the cave and go down the mountain for help

00:03:35.806 --> 00:03:38.686
on the way down the hill, they find a cabin

00:03:38.782 --> 00:03:42.142
in which they discover plenty of backpacks and mobile phones

00:03:42.238 --> 00:03:44.542
they also find an ax and a sawing machine

00:03:44.638 --> 00:03:47.422
which makes them feel a sense of fear and foreboding

00:03:47.518 --> 00:03:50.302
shortly after, the group finds Adam restrained 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:53.278
and being carried by two men wearing animal skulls

00:03:53.374 --> 00:03:57.310
they rush to stop the two men and try to let them set Adam free

00:03:57.406 --> 00:03:59.902
the men can't understand their language

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.318
Adam takes the opportunity to sneak and kill one of the men in the elk skull

00:04:04.414 --> 00:04:05.998
while the other runs away

00:04:06.094 --> 00:04:08.926
moments later, Adam's girlfriend appears 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:11.230
she reveals that she was hiding from the men in skulls 

00:04:11.326 --> 00:04:13.198
as she encountered them last night

00:04:13.342 --> 00:04:16.270
the group are frightened and attempt to leave soon

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.206
on their way back, they come across more traps and get attacked

00:04:20.302 --> 00:04:23.710
they soon find themselves surrounded by more mask-wearing men 

00:04:23.806 --> 00:04:27.070
while following Adam, his girlfriend falls into a pit 

00:04:27.166 --> 00:04:29.806
and gets impaled on sharpened tree branches

00:04:29.854 --> 00:04:34.318
though she begs for help in despair, Adam abandons her and runs for his life

00:04:34.414 --> 00:04:38.206
before she is killed by an arrow shot by a coming masked man

00:04:38.734 --> 00:04:40.462
being completely surrounded

00:04:40.558 --> 00:04:45.454
the remaining members, Jen, Adam, Darius, and Luis, are all captured

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:48.718
Jen wakes up to find herself trapped in a dark burrow

00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:52.078
she is surprised to see the woman peddler she met in town 

00:04:52.222 --> 00:04:56.542
the woman peddler stops her from shouting for help and gives her food and water

00:04:56.686 --> 00:04:59.182
she then lets her out of the burrow to meet the friends

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:01.630
who are all being controlled and tied up

00:05:01.774 --> 00:05:06.094
the friends are taken to a primitive settlement called the Foundation deep in the forest

00:05:06.142 --> 00:05:10.030
where people maintain an old lifestyle of more than 100 years ago

00:05:10.126 --> 00:05:13.726
Jen notices that the poorly dressed girl also lives here

00:05:13.822 --> 00:05:16.270
later, they are taken to the tribal court 

00:05:16.318 --> 00:05:20.590
Adam is charged with murder for he killed the man wearing the elk skull

00:05:20.686 --> 00:05:26.275
it turns that the villagers set the traps to hunt animals, but Adam accidentally fell in

00:05:26.275 --> 00:05:30.825
they were planning to take Adam down the hill, but one of them unexpectedly got killed

00:05:30.941 --> 00:05:34.541
then, Adam is found guilty and sentenced to death

00:05:34.589 --> 00:05:38.669
while Jen, Darius, and Luis are guilty of lying and sent to "darkness"

00:05:38.765 --> 00:05:42.413
Adam is then bludgeoned to death by the leader in front of his friends

00:05:42.461 --> 00:05:44.765
Luis is frightened and tries to flee 

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:48.461
but he is caught soon with his eyes blinded by a hot knife

00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:51.869
next, it is Jen and Darius's turn to be punished

00:05:52.061 --> 00:05:54.893
at the urge moment, Jen comes up with an idea 

00:05:54.989 --> 00:05:56.957
she begs the leader for his mercy

00:05:57.005 --> 00:06:01.085
claiming that the strong Darius can help with building houses for the Foundation

00:06:01.181 --> 00:06:04.445
while she can be the leader's wife to carry on the family line

00:06:04.541 --> 00:06:07.277
the leader agrees and welcomes them into the community

00:06:07.325 --> 00:06:10.925
in this way, Jen and Darius survive in the Foundation  

00:06:11.453 --> 00:06:14.813
several weeks later, Jen's father is worried about her 

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:19.181
because he has lost contact with Jen since her last call about a month ago

00:06:19.277 --> 00:06:21.485
he goes to the police station for help 

00:06:21.533 --> 00:06:25.949
however, the police can do nothing but let him fill in a missing person report

00:06:26.045 --> 00:06:29.261
Jen's father decides to find his daughter on his own

00:06:29.741 --> 00:06:31.661
he arrives in the town to search for her 

00:06:32.045 --> 00:06:34.253
he comes to the bar and meets the old man 

00:06:34.397 --> 00:06:36.989
who previously had a conflict with the young folks

00:06:37.181 --> 00:06:40.397
the old man says the group of friends may have been in danger

00:06:40.589 --> 00:06:44.573
even so, Jen's father insists he won't give up finding his daughter

00:06:44.717 --> 00:06:47.645
he then meets the old lady at the hotel reception

00:06:47.789 --> 00:06:50.861
the kind old lady tells him the story of the Foundation

00:06:51.149 --> 00:06:56.669
it was formed by several families who were afraid of the breakdown of America in 1859

00:06:56.909 --> 00:07:01.181
they have hidden in the deep wood up the hill and lived a primitive life since then

00:07:01.277 --> 00:07:05.069
for years the Foundation live in isolation from the people in town

00:07:05.213 --> 00:07:09.629
to survive, they kidnap and kill intruders to take away their belongings

00:07:09.725 --> 00:07:13.037
lots of mountain climbers haven't returned after encountering them

00:07:13.085 --> 00:07:15.917
people in town don't want to break their peaceful life 

00:07:16.109 --> 00:07:19.949
they threaten Jen's father to stop his plan of going up the hill for his daughter

00:07:20.141 --> 00:07:22.493
but nothing will make him change his mind

00:07:22.589 --> 00:07:25.997
he pays a local tracker, together with an experienced hunter

00:07:26.093 --> 00:07:27.869
to take him through the forest

00:07:28.061 --> 00:07:30.461
thanks to their helpful experience and expertise

00:07:30.557 --> 00:07:33.485
the group successfully escape several traps at first 

00:07:33.581 --> 00:07:36.029
however, before they could claim their victory

00:07:36.125 --> 00:07:39.005
the hunter triggers a trap and falls into a pit 

00:07:39.053 --> 00:07:42.989
causing him and the coming-for-rescue tracker to be killed by the following traps

00:07:43.085 --> 00:07:48.375
Jen's father survives the deadly trap, but he has to continue the adventure by himself

00:07:48.375 --> 00:07:52.550
he follows the map left by the tracker and finds the settlement at night

00:07:52.589 --> 00:07:56.525
he plans to get close quietly but is found by two men in skulls

00:07:56.669 --> 00:08:00.029
much to his surprise, one of them happens to be Darius

00:08:00.125 --> 00:08:04.781
later, Jen's father is taken into the village and soon surrounded by the crowd

00:08:04.877 --> 00:08:07.085
he shoots to warn the surrounding cultists

00:08:07.181 --> 00:08:09.773
but he is suddenly injured by an arrow 

00:08:09.965 --> 00:08:13.277
surprisingly, it was actually Jen who shot him 

00:08:13.373 --> 00:08:18.557
seemingly brainwashed, the daughter leaves her father behind as if she doesn't know him

00:08:18.749 --> 00:08:23.021
the leader of the Foundation sentences the father to "darkness" for trespassing

00:08:23.117 --> 00:08:24.893
he's then sent to prison 

00:08:24.989 --> 00:08:27.773
that night, Jen sneaks away to releases her father

00:08:27.965 --> 00:08:31.277
revealing that she shot him so as not to raise their suspicion 

00:08:31.373 --> 00:08:35.549
and she endures the humiliation only to wait for a chance to escape

00:08:35.597 --> 00:08:38.429
now it is time to run since her father is here

00:08:38.573 --> 00:08:41.549
while Jen and her father flee, she encounters Darius

00:08:41.837 --> 00:08:45.533
who refuses to leave with them as he has been totally brainwashed

00:08:45.629 --> 00:08:49.133
on their way, Jen discovers the blind and disheveled Luis 

00:08:49.229 --> 00:08:53.021
she then shoots him in the head to help end his miserable life 

00:08:53.117 --> 00:08:57.773
Jen and her father flee to kill multiple Foundation members who are hunting them

00:08:57.869 --> 00:09:01.853
they get injured when fighting with the cultists and are about to get caught again

00:09:01.949 --> 00:09:06.605
right then, the old man in the bar shows up to offer help and rescue them

00:09:06.701 --> 00:09:10.781
the old man's nephew was caught and killed by the Foundation six years ago 

00:09:10.925 --> 00:09:13.661
he had a good impression of Jen when they first met 

00:09:13.757 --> 00:09:17.309
and was deeply moved by her father's determination to save his daughter

00:09:17.405 --> 00:09:21.629
with the help of the old man, Jen, and her father manage to escape

00:09:21.677 --> 00:09:25.757
the leader of the Foundation looks on behind the trees as they drive away

00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:30.269
back to their world, Jen and her father have returned to their normal lives

00:09:30.749 --> 00:09:32.525
one day, while arriving home

00:09:32.717 --> 00:09:37.133
Jen is astonished to find the Foundation leader and the poorly dressed girl inside

00:09:37.325 --> 00:09:40.829
they are well dressed and pretend to be a new neighbor just moving in

00:09:40.925 --> 00:09:44.765
they are warmly welcomed by Jen's family, who doesn't recognize them

00:09:44.861 --> 00:09:48.557
the leader notices that Jen is several months pregnant with his child 

00:09:48.605 --> 00:09:51.677
so he asks Jen to return with him to the Foundation

00:09:51.773 --> 00:09:54.893
to protect her family, Jen reluctantly agrees to go 

00:09:54.989 --> 00:09:58.301
in exchange, he shall never interfere with her family again

00:09:58.397 --> 00:10:02.429
later, Jen follows them to get on a&nbsp;recreational vehicle and leave

00:10:02.621 --> 00:10:05.837
but it doesn't take long for the vehicle to swerves out of control 

00:10:05.933 --> 00:10:07.853
and crash into a parked car

00:10:07.949 --> 00:10:11.837
Jen gets off the vehicle and stabs the leader to death with a knife

00:10:11.981 --> 00:10:16.445
for she realizes that she can't be free again unless the leader is dead

00:10:16.493 --> 00:10:19.000
in the end, she holds the poorly dressed girl's hand 

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.485
and takes her back towards her house

00:10:21.869 --> 00:10:24.845
