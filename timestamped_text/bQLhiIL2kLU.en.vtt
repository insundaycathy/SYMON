00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.600
Sex Education follows Otis Milburn and the&nbsp;
other students at Moordale Secondary School.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.400
Otis has a few hangups when it comes to sex,&nbsp;
due to his single mother Jean being a very open&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.880
and free-spirited sex therapist AND having&nbsp;
witnessed his father cheat on his mother&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.400
as a young boy. Otis’ best friend is Eric, the&nbsp;
gay son of a religious Ghanian-Nigerian family.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.240
Otis’ crush is Maeve Wiley, an intelligent outcast&nbsp;
whose rough family life leads to self-destructive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.920
tendencies. There’s also Jackson Marchetti, the&nbsp;
headboy at Moordale who struggles to just be a kid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.280
amidst the lofty expectations placed on him by&nbsp;
his parents. Adam Groff is the headmaster’s son&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.360
who bullies the other students due to his&nbsp;
own insecurities and the extreme pressures&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.160
of his father. Aimee Gibbs is member of the&nbsp;
popular mean girls clique “The Untouchables”,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.080
but secretly she’s best friends with Maeve&nbsp;
and a people pleaser to the point of it being&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:55.760
a detriment to herself. Other members of the&nbsp;
Untouchables include Ruby, Olivia, and Anwar,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.720
the only other openly gay guy at Moordale,&nbsp;
and the crush of Eric. And then there’s Lily,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.960
an eccentric writer of alien erotica who&nbsp;
desperately wants to lose her virginity.

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.440
Throughout season 1, Otis develops a crush&nbsp;
on Maeve and the two decide to start a sex&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.080
therapy clinic to help the various sex and&nbsp;
relationship problems of the students at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.720
Moordale. Otis is using knowledge he’s picked&nbsp;
up over the years from his sex therapist mother,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.400
while Maeve is running the business side&nbsp;
of things, needing the money to help pay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.840
her rent as her parents and older&nbsp;
brother are absent from her life.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.720
The clinic ends up becoming a huge success,&nbsp;
and Otis helps many students along the way.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.960
He teaches Aimee to be her own person and to&nbsp;
pursue and communicate her own thoughts and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.800
feelings instead of living for others. This&nbsp;
eventually leads to Aimee breaking up with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.280
her Untouchables friend group and publicly&nbsp;
siding with Maeve. She also breaks up with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.640
her bully of a boyfriend Adam and eventually&nbsp;
ends up with nice guy Steve. He also helps&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.840
Lily come to terms with both her obsession and&nbsp;
internal anxieties over losing her virginity.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.640
But Otis’ preoccupation with his new side&nbsp;
hustle and his developing feelings for Maeve&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.560
create tension in his relationship with&nbsp;
best friend Eric. Throughout the season,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.360
Eric finds confidence and comfort in himself,&nbsp;
reconnecting with his family’s religious beliefs,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.520
realizing the love and support of his father,&nbsp;
confidently displaying his true self to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.800
school, and even striking up a relationship with&nbsp;
the repressed bully Adam. That relationship is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.840
short-lived, as the perpetual screw-up Adam is&nbsp;
shipped off to military school by his father.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.640
Jackson strikes up a relationship with Maeve,&nbsp;
thanks in large part to some unwitting advice&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.800
from Otis, and it’s a huge breakthrough&nbsp;
for Jackson in simply allowing himself to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.800
be a teenager. Instead of living his life&nbsp;
revolved around swim meets and practices,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.880
he can party and experience young&nbsp;
love. Unfortunately, try as she might,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.920
Maeve doesn’t reciprocate those feelings and by&nbsp;
the end of the season her and Jackson break up.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.480
Maeve spent the season trying to better herself&nbsp;
and refocus on her academics. Her writing skills&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.880
could earn her university scholarships, and an&nbsp;
essay she wrote for Adam even ends up winning an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.520
award. But those newfound successes could all come&nbsp;
grinding to a halt when her troublemaking brother&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.760
returns home. After he’s caught selling drugs&nbsp;
at the school dance, Headmaster Groff believes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.320
that Maeve and Otis’ clinic is actually a&nbsp;
drug ring and moves to have Maeve expelled.

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.160
Otis, meanwhile, is finally reckoning&nbsp;
with his relationship with his mother.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.640
After discovering she’s begun work on her&nbsp;
next book, focused on his sexual frustrations,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.160
Otis confronts his mother and the&nbsp;
two seem to genuinely reconcile.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.000
As season one comes to a close, Maeve,&nbsp;
fresh off her break-up with Jackson,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.880
finally realizes her true romantic feelings for&nbsp;
Otis and goes to tell him. Unbeknownst to her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.280
Otis has finally moved on from Maeve and&nbsp;
started a relationship with new girl Ola.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:36.240
And unbeknownst to Otis and Ola, their parents,&nbsp;
Jean and Jakob, have started up a relationship of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:41.840
their own, creating a VERY messy situation.&nbsp;
Annnnnnnd speaking of messy situations,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.000
as season one comes to a close and Otis&nbsp;
experiences his first kiss from Ola,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.640
he’s finally able to get past all of his sexual&nbsp;
hangups and masterbate for the first time.

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.680
and that's everything that happened in season 1&nbsp;
