00:00:02.139 --> 00:00:03.099
Hey everyone.

00:00:03.099 --> 00:00:05.129
Welcome back to Movie Recap.

00:00:05.129 --> 00:00:07.171
Today I'm gonna show you a movie called,

00:00:07.171 --> 00:00:08.315
Brightburn.

00:00:08.315 --> 00:00:11.262
It is a 2019 American superhero horror film

00:00:11.262 --> 00:00:14.447
directed by David Yarovesky and starring Elizabeth Banks.

00:00:14.447 --> 00:00:17.420
The movie is about a young boy of extraterrestrial origin

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.963
reared on Earth who realizes he has superpowers

00:00:19.963 --> 00:00:22.595
and begins to use them for sinister purposes.

00:00:22.595 --> 00:00:24.194
Let s start...!

00:00:34.751 --> 00:00:38.659
We first meet Tori and Kyle Breyer as they attempt to conceive a child.

00:00:38.659 --> 00:00:41.654
We see a number of books on shelves indicating this,

00:00:41.654 --> 00:00:43.606
though they appear to be unsuccessful.

00:00:43.606 --> 00:00:45.372
In the middle of their latest attempt,

00:00:45.372 --> 00:00:48.901
Tori feels vibrations from something crashing outside.

00:00:48.901 --> 00:00:53.581
At first, she brushes it off, but then a louder shake turns the lights off.

00:00:53.581 --> 00:00:57.717
They look out the window and see something has crashed outside.

00:00:57.717 --> 00:01:02.108
We then flash forward to a video of a child, Brandon, as he grows up.

00:01:02.108 --> 00:01:03.906
After seeing some of these clips,

00:01:03.906 --> 00:01:08.063
Tori is playing hide and seek with a slightly grown-up version of Brandon.

00:01:08.063 --> 00:01:12.250
Brandon is then at school, answering a question by a teacher.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.746
This gets the attention of a young classmate named Caitlyn.

00:01:16.512 --> 00:01:19.035
Back at the farm that night, as Tori paints,

00:01:19.035 --> 00:01:21.924
Brandon sleepwalks to the basement and finds a meteor,

00:01:21.924 --> 00:01:24.332
the one he presumably arrived on Earth in.

00:01:24.332 --> 00:01:27.379
He chants angrily as he attempts to get close to it.

00:01:27.379 --> 00:01:29.164
Tori calms him down.

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:34.523
The next morning, Brandon sets out to mow the lawn.

00:01:34.523 --> 00:01:38.436
Frustrated with starting the mower, he flings it a few hundred feet.

00:01:38.436 --> 00:01:40.870
He goes over to see the blade spinning on it.

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:45.744
Curious, he jams his hand into it, stopping it cold without taking a scratch.

00:01:46.328 --> 00:01:49.068
The family stops at a diner later on with Tori,

00:01:49.068 --> 00:01:52.151
Kyle, his aunt Merilee and his uncle Noah.

00:01:52.151 --> 00:01:55.969
When Noah attempts to give him a toy gun, Kyle chastises him.

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:58.305
However, Brandon demands the gun.

00:01:58.305 --> 00:02:01.764
With that, the family leaves in the midst of their celebration,

00:02:01.764 --> 00:02:04.273
with a waitress looking on as they depart.

00:02:05.104 --> 00:02:08.242
The next morning, Brandon isn't even listening to Kyle.

00:02:08.242 --> 00:02:10.624
He notices that Brandon is chewing on a fork

00:02:10.624 --> 00:02:13.013
without taking any damage to his teeth.

00:02:13.948 --> 00:02:17.106
Kyle takes Brandon hunting, showing him his rifle,

00:02:17.106 --> 00:02:19.190
and explaining how his body's changing

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.910
after Tori found some lingerie ads underneath his bed.

00:02:23.586 --> 00:02:24.659
Later that night,

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:28.545
Brandon is stalking Caitlyn while listening to a slow rock tune.

00:02:28.545 --> 00:02:32.613
She notices the music is coming from her laptop, and she shuts it.

00:02:32.613 --> 00:02:36.299
However, she's nervous that he's watching her from a nearby window.

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:39.014
Suddenly, her mother, the waitress from earlier,

00:02:39.014 --> 00:02:41.416
bursts in, asking what's wrong.

00:02:41.416 --> 00:02:43.403
She begins breathing nervously.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.625
Back at the farm, Noah and Tori are looking for Brandon.

00:02:48.625 --> 00:02:50.029
They find him.

00:02:51.185 --> 00:02:52.854
The next day, at school,

00:02:52.854 --> 00:02:54.687
Tori talks with Brandon's teacher

00:02:54.687 --> 00:02:57.575
as he does some mysterious drawings in his notebook.

00:02:57.575 --> 00:03:01.188
Tori asks about them, and he closes it and walks away.

00:03:01.642 --> 00:03:05.605
Back at the farm, Kyle notices Brandon startling some chickens.

00:03:05.605 --> 00:03:08.859
He asks if he's all right, to which he acknowledges he is.

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:10.500
The two go inside.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.203
Later on, Tori and Kyle go outside to see all the chickens have been murdered.

00:03:15.203 --> 00:03:18.457
Tori thinks a wolf did it, but Kyle thinks it's Brandon,

00:03:18.457 --> 00:03:20.417
noting he was out there earlier.

00:03:20.417 --> 00:03:22.908
At school the next day,

00:03:22.908 --> 00:03:26.560
Brandon and his classmates take part in a trust fall exercise.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.459
Caitlyn is nervous about what took place the other night

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.087
but doesn't say anything.

00:03:31.087 --> 00:03:35.195
However, he falls to the ground after one classmate fails to catch him.

00:03:35.195 --> 00:03:37.166
He's okay, but Caitlyn notes

00:03:37.166 --> 00:03:39.805
that she won't help him because he s a pervert.

00:03:39.805 --> 00:03:41.342
Brandon says it's a lie.

00:03:41.342 --> 00:03:43.455
The coach forces her to help him up.

00:03:43.455 --> 00:03:47.610
But he takes her hand and suddenly breaks it, sending her screaming.

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:52.302
He's then in the office, with Tori explaining to Caitlyn's mother

00:03:52.302 --> 00:03:54.417
that he's sorry and accidents happen.

00:03:54.417 --> 00:03:56.872
The mother, however, isn't so sure.

00:03:56.872 --> 00:04:00.081
She demands the sheriff arrest him, but he refuses.

00:04:00.081 --> 00:04:02.935
He'll be in special sessions in school instead.

00:04:02.935 --> 00:04:07.628
Meanwhile, Brandon just sits here, looking sad as they continue to argue.

00:04:07.628 --> 00:04:12.127
The mother insists that a psycho gave birth to him, but Tori defends him.

00:04:12.127 --> 00:04:16.337
The family leaves, but not before Brandon gives her a menacing stare.

00:04:17.506 --> 00:04:20.816
Later that night, he hears Kyle and Tori talking about him.

00:04:20.816 --> 00:04:22.682
Tori then reads up on meteors,

00:04:22.682 --> 00:04:25.360
but then notices something happening in the barn.

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.189
Brandon experiencing something glowing, possibly from the meteor.

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:33.304
She rushes out to check on him, only to find him levitating in the barn.

00:04:33.304 --> 00:04:36.907
He continues to chant "Take the world" as she approaches.

00:04:36.907 --> 00:04:39.862
He falls and cuts his hand on part of the meteor.

00:04:39.862 --> 00:04:42.746
She goes down to recover and talk him back down.

00:04:42.746 --> 00:04:45.857
He freaks out and explains that he came from the sky,

00:04:45.857 --> 00:04:48.661
and he yells that she lied to him and runs off.

00:04:48.661 --> 00:04:52.184
She goes and tells Kyle what he discovered with the meteor.

00:04:52.483 --> 00:04:57.395
Angry as he walks along, Brandon screams and fires lasers from his eyes.

00:04:57.395 --> 00:04:59.730
Later, he visits Caitlyn in her bedroom

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:02.545
as she types with her one good hand on her laptop.

00:05:02.545 --> 00:05:06.867
He tells her not to be scared, and that she knows just how special he is.

00:05:06.867 --> 00:05:09.851
She says her mother said not to talk to her, but he says,

00:05:09.851 --> 00:05:11.750
he's gonna take care of that.

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:15.664
She cries as he suddenly departs, leaving a flower behind for her.

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.934
Meanwhile, at the diner, her mother is just closing up shop,

00:05:19.934 --> 00:05:21.980
but she notices something is off.

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:25.216
She walks out and suddenly sees diagrams on the windows,

00:05:25.216 --> 00:05:27.813
similar to that of what Brandon drew in his book.

00:05:27.813 --> 00:05:29.719
The lights begin flickering.

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:31.762
Suddenly, the windows shatter,

00:05:31.762 --> 00:05:34.479
and the mother removes a piece of glass from her eye.

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:38.594
She looks around and doesn't see anything, but knows someone is there.

00:05:38.594 --> 00:05:43.558
She grabs a baseball bat, only to see a shadow figure fly by at rapid speed.

00:05:43.558 --> 00:05:45.865
She takes a swing but doesn't hit anything,

00:05:45.865 --> 00:05:49.019
then retreats to the cooler in the back, locking the door.

00:05:49.019 --> 00:05:50.547
She scrambles for safety,

00:05:50.547 --> 00:05:53.887
only for Brandon to burn through the door with his laser vision.

00:05:53.887 --> 00:05:56.587
He tears the door off and looks menacingly at her

00:05:56.587 --> 00:05:59.470
before he charges and presumably kills her.

00:06:00.483 --> 00:06:03.905
The next morning, Brandon meets back up with his parents,

00:06:03.905 --> 00:06:07.411
telling them everything is fine with how things were explained.

00:06:07.982 --> 00:06:11.764
Back at the diner, a sheriff and his deputy investigate what happened,

00:06:11.764 --> 00:06:13.914
including what's left of her body.

00:06:13.914 --> 00:06:17.808
The sheriff locates one of the diagrams on the window that Brandon drew.

00:06:21.509 --> 00:06:25.083
Merilee, who's also a counselor, tries to talk to Brandon,

00:06:25.083 --> 00:06:28.465
but he's despondent in terms of explaining what's going on.

00:06:28.465 --> 00:06:30.478
The session pretty much goes nowhere,

00:06:30.478 --> 00:06:34.102
and Merilee considers talking to the police about his behavior.

00:06:34.102 --> 00:06:36.834
Later, at a bar, Kyle talks with his friends

00:06:36.834 --> 00:06:39.148
about what went down with Caitlyn's hand,

00:06:39.148 --> 00:06:41.659
and he starts to think his son is a monster.

00:06:41.659 --> 00:06:45.061
Merilee, back at home is doing things in the bathroom

00:06:45.061 --> 00:06:47.371
as the lights flicker on and off quickly.

00:06:48.267 --> 00:06:52.770
Brandon shows up at Merilee's house later on and says he needs to talk to her.

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:56.690
He says not to talk to the police, as it s not good for anyone.

00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:59.680
She tells him to go home, and he leaves supposedly.

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:03.681
But he later stands outside her window and watches her text Noah.

00:07:03.681 --> 00:07:05.981
He comes back in the house in his costume,

00:07:05.981 --> 00:07:08.800
but Noah returns and finds him in the closet.

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:11.912
He escorts him out and threatens to tell his parents.

00:07:11.912 --> 00:07:13.978
They start to load up on Noah's truck,

00:07:13.978 --> 00:07:16.217
and when he tries to force Brandon into it,

00:07:16.217 --> 00:07:18.455
he's thrown up against the garage door.

00:07:19.377 --> 00:07:22.207
He gets up and drives away in his truck, fearful,

00:07:22.207 --> 00:07:24.761
but he is convinced Brandon is following him.

00:07:24.761 --> 00:07:28.843
Suddenly, the truck starts swerving out of control and loses power.

00:07:28.843 --> 00:07:30.396
He attempts to restart it,

00:07:30.396 --> 00:07:33.030
but Brandon appears in front of him as he screams.

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:34.962
He lifts the truck off the ground,

00:07:34.962 --> 00:07:39.037
levitating it in the air and then suddenly sending it crashing down.

00:07:39.037 --> 00:07:43.054
Noah viscerally breaks his jaw in the process as Brandon goes over to him.

00:07:43.054 --> 00:07:44.487
As he lays there dying,

00:07:44.487 --> 00:07:48.315
Brandon draws out another one of his symbols in the ground in his blood.

00:07:49.302 --> 00:07:53.233
Brandon returns home, saying he was playing soccer the whole time.

00:07:53.233 --> 00:07:57.020
He explains how he was bullied, and that's how he lost his shirt.

00:07:58.903 --> 00:08:00.786
That night, Kyle has a nightmare

00:08:00.786 --> 00:08:02.402
that shows him how Tori first

00:08:02.402 --> 00:08:05.467
found the baby in the meteor and chooses to adopt him.

00:08:05.467 --> 00:08:09.567
However, it startles him when its eyes suddenly light up with lasers.

00:08:12.086 --> 00:08:13.179
The phone awakens him,

00:08:13.179 --> 00:08:16.860
and Kyle and Tori are called to the hospital, where Merilee is.

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:19.819
She explains Noah was killed, and they comfort her.

00:08:19.819 --> 00:08:24.306
She explains that Brandon came to visit beforehand, which concerns Kyle.

00:08:24.306 --> 00:08:27.371
The next morning, they give Brandon the news about Noah,

00:08:27.371 --> 00:08:29.248
but all he says is, "Okay."

00:08:29.248 --> 00:08:33.366
Kyle now wonders what s up with that and accuses Brandon of being there.

00:08:33.366 --> 00:08:36.755
Tori tries to calm him down, but he just gets angrier.

00:08:36.755 --> 00:08:41.586
Suddenly, Brandon shoves him into the pantry, breaking the doors in the process.

00:08:41.586 --> 00:08:42.904
Tori sends him away.

00:08:43.982 --> 00:08:47.997
Later, Kyle finds Brandon's shirt and notices a little blood on it,

00:08:47.997 --> 00:08:50.828
but manages to take it away without him noticing.

00:08:50.828 --> 00:08:55.109
He apologizes for earlier, but Brandon just says, "Okay" again.

00:08:55.317 --> 00:08:57.796
Later, Kyle explains to Tori what he found,

00:08:57.796 --> 00:09:00.492
but she refuses to accept what he's saying.

00:09:00.492 --> 00:09:03.566
Meanwhile, the sheriff takes a close look at the accident

00:09:03.566 --> 00:09:06.638
and notices similarities with the diagram from the window

00:09:06.638 --> 00:09:08.729
and what was drawn on the ground.

00:09:09.599 --> 00:09:12.064
Kyle looks through old birthday cards of Brandon's

00:09:12.064 --> 00:09:14.433
and tries to comfort Tori that night.

00:09:14.433 --> 00:09:17.818
The next day, he opts to take Brandon on a hunting trip.

00:09:17.818 --> 00:09:22.344
As they go, the sheriff visits Tori to explain what he's found with the photos.

00:09:22.344 --> 00:09:25.547
She doesn't acknowledge them, but he says he'll be back.

00:09:26.222 --> 00:09:29.428
In the woods, Brandon and Kyle follow some deer tracks,

00:09:29.428 --> 00:09:31.362
and Kyle lets him walk ahead.

00:09:31.362 --> 00:09:34.010
Back at the house, Tori finds Brandon's notebook

00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:37.294
and notices the same diagram from the window and the road,

00:09:37.294 --> 00:09:40.814
along with other drawings like his outfit and glass in the waitress's eye,

00:09:40.814 --> 00:09:43.351
and several dead people along with the words,

00:09:43.351 --> 00:09:45.852
"TAKE THE WORLD." She panics.

00:09:47.319 --> 00:09:48.260
Back in the woods,

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:51.863
Brandon investigates the tracks as Kyle attempts to shoot him.

00:09:51.863 --> 00:09:55.353
The bullet fires, but just bounces off of Brandon's head.

00:09:55.353 --> 00:09:58.780
He shows a startled look as Kyle attempts to reload.

00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:01.521
Once he does, however, Brandon vanishes.

00:10:01.521 --> 00:10:04.915
Kyle runs in a panic, but Brandon, now hooded again,

00:10:04.915 --> 00:10:07.328
flies around and appears around him.

00:10:07.328 --> 00:10:10.439
He finally tackles him and forces him to sit up.

00:10:10.439 --> 00:10:14.463
Kyle tries to apologize, but Brandon suddenly fires his laser eyes

00:10:14.463 --> 00:10:17.019
that shoot through his skull, killing him.

00:10:17.785 --> 00:10:21.990
At the house, Tori frantically tries to call Kyle but to no avail.

00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:25.732
Brandon finally answers, and Tori asks where Kyle is.

00:10:25.732 --> 00:10:29.419
Brandon explains, "He's gone," and that he's coming home.

00:10:29.419 --> 00:10:33.066
He hangs up and begins flying through the house at a rapid pace,

00:10:33.066 --> 00:10:34.782
destroying it in the process.

00:10:34.782 --> 00:10:38.184
She calls 911 as he continues to fly around her.

00:10:39.651 --> 00:10:43.893
The sheriff and his deputy are called in after the 911 call is cut short.

00:10:43.893 --> 00:10:47.923
They show up to see the house is devastated from Brandon's destruction.

00:10:47.923 --> 00:10:51.416
Tori starts to come out of the house as the sheriff calls out to her.

00:10:51.416 --> 00:10:53.620
However, before she can talk with him,

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:56.436
Brandon rushes him and rips him to shreds.

00:10:56.436 --> 00:11:00.226
Panicking, Tori and the deputy make their way inside the house.

00:11:01.252 --> 00:11:05.812
Tori goes upstairs to hide as the deputy cocks her gun, looking for Brandon.

00:11:05.812 --> 00:11:07.298
She calls for backup.

00:11:07.298 --> 00:11:10.936
She walks around the house and sees Brandon appear in front of her

00:11:10.936 --> 00:11:12.744
and then suddenly behind her.

00:11:12.744 --> 00:11:16.215
The sounds of her being torn apart by him can be heard by Tori.

00:11:16.215 --> 00:11:19.234
She continues to be quiet as Brandon looks around for her.

00:11:19.234 --> 00:11:22.769
She makes her way out the window and crashes to the ground.

00:11:23.016 --> 00:11:26.539
Tori makes her way to the barn, where the meteor is located.

00:11:26.539 --> 00:11:29.759
She remembers earlier where Brandon was injured in his fall

00:11:29.759 --> 00:11:32.046
and rips off a shard from the meteor.

00:11:32.046 --> 00:11:36.225
She finds the body of the waitress as she hides the shard and calls for Brandon.

00:11:36.225 --> 00:11:40.695
He shows up, hooded and all, and she explains that he means everything to her.

00:11:40.695 --> 00:11:44.077
She goes to take his hood off, and he looks at her innocently.

00:11:44.077 --> 00:11:48.048
The two embrace and she prepares to stab Brandon with the shard.

00:11:48.464 --> 00:11:52.110
However, he catches her hand, forcing the shard out of it.

00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:56.344
Angry, he flies her into the air, several hundred feet into the air.

00:11:56.344 --> 00:12:00.550
He gives her one last look, holds her out, and drops her to her death.

00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:04.476
As he levitates in air, an oncoming plane comes towards him.

00:12:05.047 --> 00:12:06.930
The next day, wreckage from the plane

00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:10.649
is shown on the ground, with no survivors from the crash.

00:12:10.649 --> 00:12:13.552
It's reported that the plane crashed into the farmhouse, 

00:12:13.552 --> 00:12:15.324
with Kyle and Tori inside. 

00:12:15.324 --> 00:12:19.117
Brandon sits there, eating a cookie with an innocent look on his face.

00:12:20.104 --> 00:12:21.630
During the end credits,

00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:25.254
we see cities devastated and millions dying by Brandon's hands.

00:12:28.708 --> 00:12:29.728
Thanks for watching...
