Welcome to Cinema Summary, ladies and gentlemen.

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:12.700
You know I like movies and telling you about
them, but have you ever watched a movie and

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.880
midway through you realize: it wasn't
very good and it’s actually boring?

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.840
Yeah, this is one of those films, and I’m
gonna tell you all about it since its my job

00:00:21.841 --> 00:00:27.410
to explain and summarize movies but this time I’m
really gonna lash out and tell you how I really feel

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.820
about this film so this is Kidnapping
Stella, strap in folks as I strap on.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.540
The film has a promising start introducing
us to our protagonists, Vic (the bearded one)

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:44.019
and Tom (the twink), who we first see stealing
a car in Berlin, before removing its license

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:45.729
plates at a garage

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:50.400
They then proceed to buy a lot of random
items at a home improvement store.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:55.540
Stuff which they take to a grungy looking
apartment in order to prepare it and I’ll

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.820
be honest with you, that start was pretty
killer and it got me really hyped for the movie

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.939
but let’s just say that was basically the only interesting
part of the movie: So anyways they start boarding

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:10.200
up windows, sound proofing the walls, nailing
the bed to the floor and adding a set of locks

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.750
to keep people out.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.530
Giving each other a set of keys for the locks
before heading out to the forest at night

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.570
to nail a red cloth to a tree.

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.380
As well as modifying their van with a few
new additions before they wait in broad daylight

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.520
for their target: Stella Martens.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.090
They put on their masks before grabbing her
and putting her in their van, after which

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.640
Tom takes the woman’s phone, disconnecting
the battery and the SIM card,

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.340
allowing them to vanish.

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:41.320
They then take her to the dingy 1 star apartment
they rented, where Stella and us will be kept prisoner

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.230
here for the rest of the film.

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:47.450
Anyways, they lock her up, strip her, before
taking photos of her.

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.290
Putting her clothes in a bin liner before
dressing her up like the Tethered from Us.

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.260
Later, they demand that she give them her
father’s email address and phone number,

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.140
and she gives it

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.420
Then they go out, Tom putting Stella’s phone
in the garbage bag with her trashy clothes,

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.890
while Vic uploads the photos to a computer
before putting it on a thumb drive and leaving.

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.190
As Tom goes in to check up on her, standing there
like a freakazoid every ten minutes.

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.370
He realizes he 's torn about this whole thing.

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:18.660
When Vic comes back, he’s brought back with him
disposable phones, so after geting her some water

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:24.470
they tell her that if she needs to pee or poo she
should either stick 1 finger up or 2.

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:30.630
She needs to go #1, so our delightful duo
of kidnappers grab a plastic jug and help

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.560
her out with Vic looking away and Tom
staring intently at the pee jug

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.720
After she’s done, Tom dumps the bottle,
and grabs some food but isn’t hungry.

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.610
Something that Vic gets on his case about
since Tom needs his energy and after refusing

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.770
to eat, Vic forces Tom to chew on a chicken
nugget which he swallows

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.120
but he’s still not hungry due to
the stress of the situation.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.300
This leads to a conversation between the two
where we find out that Vic and Tom have been

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.400
planning this for a long time ever since they
were in prison.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:06.540
and they need to stick to the plan to get the ransom
money and Vic leaves for some reason as Tom

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:12.170
stays behind to check the photos of Stella,
he’s starting to feel a little guilty about this

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:17.230
He goes in to check on her and is about to
leave when she needs to go poo, so like a

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.420
complete amateur he leaves the door open while he
grabs a bucket and some toilet paper

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.890
and brings it back along with a gun.

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.530
After taking her out of her restraints, he
makes her poop at gunpoint, which I know the

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.600
feeling of but this isn’t the time and place
to talk about it.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.440
but she can’t poop because of stage-

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:40.860
but she can't poop because of stage fright
 and needs privacy so Tom turns around AGAIN LIKE

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:46.140
A AMATEUR, gets hit with a bucket, dropping
the gun which Stella grabs and threatens him

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:51.080
with, demanding that he throw the key to her but
he steps in and tries to grab the gun but

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.090
she fires it.

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:57.060
and Tom suffers from an episode of Tinnitus
and as he's trying to recover

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.160
Stella unmasks him and
recognizes him.

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:01.553
Why did you do this?

00:04:01.553 --> 00:04:02.730
You ruined my life!

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:07.849
And Stella’s so shocked that Tom is able
to tackle her and lock her up again.

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:11.680
and he leaves but not before telling her that if Vic finds
out they know each other

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.300
Vic will kill them both

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:18.750
Speaking of the devil, Vic’s back with bad news: Stella’s
dad won’t send the money but Vic’s sure

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.650
that he will soon.

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:26.479
and the next day, Tom films Stella and Vic as
he’s about to cut off Stella’s pinky finger but

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:30.659
as she’s speaking into the camera, she mentions
that she’s 4 months pregnant.

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:32.720
Tom says “that’s enough” and they stop
filming,

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:38.300
and they have enough footage for a ransom video
but Vic tells him NEVER to do that again.

00:04:38.339 --> 00:04:43.599
So Vic makes the ransom video and they prepare
to go back inside but Vic notices Tom forgot

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:45.270
his mask and he puts it on.

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:50.650
and they go inside to feed her minestrone soup
(Here comes the airplane) and during

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:55.520
feeding time, Tom notices the bullet casing
from earlier and tries to get it after the

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.139
plastic spoon Vic was using falls to the ground
and they leave the room

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:04.379
With Tom going to the bathroom to flush the
casing  down but it doesn’t go down and after

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:09.529
a few more tries which gets Vic’s attention,
Tom grabs the casing with his fingers and

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:11.509
no joke, swallows it.

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:12.870
What a champ.

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:17.449
After that ordeal and some mild sexual tension
between Mr. Tomp and Bottom, Tom does some

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:23.369
calculations and realizes that Stella is lying to him
and confronts her and we find out a little bit about their

00:05:23.369 --> 00:05:27.060
history: at one point in the past they
were dating, he was a criminal

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.880
even before prison, he got her pregnant 
and then he went to jail and she realized that

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.660
She didn’t want someone like that in her
life and left him.

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:38.119
Although something interesting in their discussions that
Vic learned of Stella after Tom mentioned her

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:44.580
name as she fit the criteria of their ransom
plan: single child, female, rich father.

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:49.260
and although Tom doesn't believe her, Stella is adamant
that she’s pregnant and tells him

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:53.100
that he can find out if he just turns on
 her phone to see her doctor appointments

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:57.140
something that he realizes is just a trick
so that the police can locate the phone.

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:01.440
But then she begins to choke and when Tom
goes to help her she throws up and they get

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:06.249
close and begin to make out, but it’s all
a trick to get free so that she can handcuff

00:06:06.249 --> 00:06:10.949
Tom to the bedframe while she goes to call the
police on a disposable phone but finds

00:06:10.949 --> 00:06:14.490
out she needs a key to unlock the door’s
locks.

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:19.300
A key that slipped out of Tom’s hands which
is now on the floor of the hostage room,

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:24.340
So Stella puts the phone in her pocket and lunges for
the keys but Tom is able to knock her out

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:28.480
and break the bed frame to get free and
puts Stella back in her place

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:32.800
As he goes to wash up the vomit, Vic comes
back telling Tom that Stella’s dad will

00:06:32.809 --> 00:06:36.719
deliver the 4 million euros at the coordinates.

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.520
So they have to move her in the van to the
boat house.

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:44.140
and then they have moement where Vic confides with 
Tom that he's planning on going to Mexico

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:49.020
to meet with a friend and go to the Pacific 
Ocean with the money and retire over there

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:52.640
now it's not my place to stomp on someone's
dreams but that is super cliché

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:56.060
and that is a proud American tradition 
that I will not tolerate

00:06:56.060 --> 00:07:00.639
so you German criminals can go find your own Mexico
either down in Poland or in Argentina

00:07:00.639 --> 00:07:06.409
Anyways, Tom goes to prep the van and finds a doctors
note that proves Stella’s pregnant while

00:07:06.409 --> 00:07:11.899
Vic talks with her and realizes that something’s
wrong: she has one of the disposable phones,

00:07:11.899 --> 00:07:15.020
knows Tom’s name, and there’s a bullet
in the wall.

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:17.669
Which I mean of all the things that could
happen, he finds the exact place where the

00:07:17.669 --> 00:07:18.669
bullet was?

00:07:18.669 --> 00:07:20.679
Is that bad script writing or pure luck?

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:25.800
and to make it worse, Stella reveals
that she and Tom know each other.

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.200
Looks like someone's going to die soon

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:32.000
After prepping the van, Tom comes back and
Vic is being weird.

00:07:32.069 --> 00:07:36.180
Checking that the gun is working, and talking
about Stella and Tom in a vaguely threatening

00:07:36.189 --> 00:07:39.349
way before they move onto the next phase of
the plan.

00:07:39.349 --> 00:07:43.789
Vic injects Stella with an anesthetic before
he and Tom dump in her in the van, though

00:07:43.789 --> 00:07:46.319
Vic is on the phone for some reason.

00:07:46.319 --> 00:07:47.330
Did you send the coordinates?

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:50.400
Ja, ja. Everything is gut. Do not worry young Tom!

00:07:50.499 --> 00:07:55.229
They drive the van to a boathouse where they
lock Stella up and Vic changes the plan and

00:07:55.229 --> 00:07:59.139
brings Tom with him to pick up the money 
and just before they go into the forest

00:07:59.139 --> 00:08:04.560
Tom puts the battery back into Stella’s phone before 
going to the tree with red cloth nailed into it

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:08.029
the same tree from earlier but when
he goes check the money SURPRISE!

00:08:08.029 --> 00:08:11.310
It’s not there, tricky Vic tricked Tom!

00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:13.229
What a tweest!

00:08:13.229 --> 00:08:17.830
Then Vic prepares to execute Tom who begs
Vic not to kill him and alludes to an intimate

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:22.259
relationship they had back in prison before
he runs away and gets shot.

00:08:22.259 --> 00:08:27.819
So Stella’s still locked up, Tom is dead,
and Vic’s got the money and he drives back

00:08:27.819 --> 00:08:31.949
to that place we saw at the beginning of the
film to switch cars before driving back to

00:08:31.949 --> 00:08:36.260
the boathouse to poison Stella but guess who
comes to save the day!

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:37.390
It’s Tom!

00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:38.390
Shocking.

00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:43.760
Who hits Vic on the head with a stick before
he is shot by Vic which leads to Vic getting killed

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:48.510
after being tripped by Stella, causing him 
to drop his gun which Tom uses to take Vic out.

00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:52.910
The film ends with Stella freed, Tom and Vic
are dead, and Stella escapes in the car Vic

00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:59.260
drove, taking the money that was
used to pay for her ransom and disappearing.... to Poland

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:02.320
And with that being said, thank you so much for watching ladies and gentlemen

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:06.620
I realize this is a very different style of a video than I do usually

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:10.560
and I hoped you enjoyed it, if you did leave a like down below and if otherwise... uh

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:13.940
let me know with a comment down below, 
how I should improve, if you liked it,

00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:20.860
or if I should change or get rid of it and subscribe if you
