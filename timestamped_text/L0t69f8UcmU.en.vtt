00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.100
Welcome back to Movie Recaps.

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.810
Today I will show you a horror, mystery film
from 2008, titled Mirrors.

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:07.810
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:09.970
Watch out and take care.

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:13.050
Garry can be seen running through a subway
station, trying to get out.

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.490
He gets to a locked door and breaks it open.

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:18.640
Once inside he heads to a window, only to
find it bricked up.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.550
Suddenly, all the lockers in the room open,
revealing their mirrors.

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.380
Garry walks up to the giant mirror in the
room and says he wasn't trying to escape.

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.300
The mirror begins to shatter and he wants
to clean it up, but breaks off a piece.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.520
He says he's sorry and goes to pick up the
piece, but his mirror image stays in place.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.020
The man sees the piece of mirror in his hand
in the reflection and the mirror image uses

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:39.540
it to kill him.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.030
An alarm beeps and a man turns it off, then
gets out of bed.

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.260
Ben looks at himself in the mirror in his
bathroom and drinks a crushed up tablet in

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.380
his water.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.930
He says goodbye to his sister Angie and tells
her everything will be fine.

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.940
Ben walks over to an abandoned estate and
the security guard Lorenzo lets him in.

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.280
They walk toward the burned building and Lorenzo
explains that he worked there when the fire

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.510
took the building out.

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.540
He tells him that even after 5 years the owners
are still in a legal battle with the insurance

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:04.590
company.

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:08.290
Before the building was a store it was a hospital
that closed down in the fifties.

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.150
The company expects security to patrol the
place every couple of hours, but it usually

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.479
remains calm.

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:17.039
Lorenzo says that the cosmetics department
gives him the creeps at night, because there

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:19.490
is no electricity and too many mirrors.

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.829
Ben asks who polishes the mirrors and the
old guard tells him that was the man he's

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:26.590
there to replace - Gary, who spent the entire
night cleaning them.

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.590
On the tour around the place, Lorenzo asks
why Ben left the police force, but he doesn't

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.350
feel like answering that question.

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.340
Lastly, he shows Ben to the trailer for the
security.

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.189
Meanwhile, the mirrors in the building come
to life.

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.420
Later, Amy comes back home and asks her housekeeper
Rosa about the kids.

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.679
She tells her that they're upstairs with Ben.

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:47.439
Amy walks up and finds them playing and talking.

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:51.400
She asks to talk to him and they go to the
bedroom, immediately starting to argue.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.679
He tells her that he hasn't had a drink for
three months and that he has a new job until

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:56.799
he can get reinstated in the force.

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:00.390
Amy doesn't believe he can change, but he
tells her that she wasn't there for him when

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.149
he killed someone on duty.

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:05.740
She gets angry, telling him that she was the
only one that ever believed in him, while

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.659
their son listens to them argue.

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:10.299
He apologizes, but they continue to fight.

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:13.800
He kisses her and it's clear that they both
care a lot for each other still, though she

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.909
pulls away and tells him that she can't do
that anymore.

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:20.280
That night, Ben is at work, still getting
used to the place.

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.620
He finds a bottle of whiskey in the cupboard,
but puts it aside.

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.920
His alarm rings and he goes out on patrol
inside the building.

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.310
The inside of the burned store looks like
a true nightmare come to life.

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.459
Ben arrives at the cosmetics department.

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.640
He sees his reflection in one of the mirrors
and cleans some dirt off his uniform.

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.520
Before he leaves, he notices a handprint on
the mirror.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.689
He lights it up again and tries to clean it,
but it looks as if it's stuck from the inside.

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:46.390
The entire mirror has handprints going way
up to the top.

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.590
A door opens in the reflection, but in reality
it remains closed.

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.510
Ben still goes over to check on the real one,
but keeps checking the reflection.

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.560
The door leads to a steep staircase, bringing
Ben down to a flooded basement.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.700
He turns the lights on and the door in the
reflection slams shut.

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.629
The next day, Ben is at home taking another
tablet, when his sister shows up and tells

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:07.410
him not to take them anymore.

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.830
She's concerned about him and he tells her
that even though he doesn't like his new job,

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.250
he needs it to take care of Amy and his kids.

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.129
He doesn't want to sleep on her couch for
the rest of his life.

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:19.129
She tells him that he should think about getting
a daytime job.

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:22.349
Ben looks back in the mirror and his face
looks like its melting.

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:25.430
Angie comes back and he tells her to get out
and leave him alone.

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.459
He looks at himself again, but everything
looks normal.

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:30.330
Ben thinks his loosing his mind.

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.690
Later, he's on another patrol at work, looking
over the burned manikins and the mirror filled

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.310
walls, when he thinks he sees someone behind
him.

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.909
Ben peers into another mirror and places his
palm to match the print, when it shatters

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:42.269
and cuts him.

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:45.780
Looking back at it, the mirror looks unbroken
and suddenly a burning woman appears behind

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.959
him that vanishes when he turns around.

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:51.750
He looks back at the reflection and sees people
in flames, but nothing in real life.

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.890
A fire starts and Ben bursts out in flames,
but in reality there is nothing wrong with

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:56.890
him.

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:00.439
He puts himself back together when he notices
that everything is fine and he finds Garry's

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:01.959
wallet on the floor.

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:04.870
Ben gets back to the trailer and goes though
Garry's locker.

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.030
He cleans out his wound and dresses it.

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.599
Ben checks Garry's wallet and finds a note
inside, with the word "esseker" written on

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:11.599
it.

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:15.640
He's back inside the building and goes up
to the second floor to the cosmetics department.

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.799
When he gets there, he checks the walls and
suddenly hears a woman screaming in pain.

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:22.780
He places where the sound is coming from and
runs towards it.

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.490
He enters a room looking for the woman, going
through every part of the place, but he can't

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:27.530
find her.

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.240
Suddenly, he hears her again and sees her
reflection in the mirror, but doesn't see

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:32.460
her normally.

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.830
When he pulls the changing room curtain he
sees nothing there, so he drags the mirror

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.530
closer and places it in front of the room,
then shines a light on it and sees the woman

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:40.530
again.

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.330
The burning woman can only be seen in the
reflection.

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:47.180
Ben's son Michael wakes up screaming and when
Amy goes over to comfort him, he says that

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.250
there is a lady screaming in the mirror.

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:53.150
She tells him it's just a nightmare and leaves
his room, leaving the door open.

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:57.030
She goes to bed and when she turns off the
TV, the woman appears on the screen and back

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:58.259
in Michael's mirror.

00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:02.789
Later, Ben is at the bar where Angie works
and is telling her about what he experienced.

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:06.669
She thinks it's just the stress from everything
that has been going on in his life.

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:09.870
But Ben keeps talking about mirrors and how
they are everywhere.

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:12.460
He feels like the reflection is looking back
at him.

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.750
Angie tells him to talk to someone and pleads
with him to get some sleep.

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.430
Ben is sleeping, when someone knocks at his
door.

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.210
He gets a package from Garry.

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:23.550
It contains articles about the fire in the
store and one on the man that confessed to

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:25.500
the crime of setting it on fire.

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.599
Ben arrives to work as Lorenzo is leaving
and he wants to talk to him about what he's

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:29.620
been seeing.

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:33.199
However, Lorenzo tells him that the police
has been there and has informed him about

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:34.479
Garry's death.

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:36.199
They didn't tell him how he died.

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:39.639
Lorenzo tells Ben that they'll send someone
over to fix the leak in the basement.

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:44.180
Amy is at work overseeing an autopsy, when
she gets called into the lobby to meet Ben.

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:47.920
He asks her to show him Garry's body because
he needs to know how he died.

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:50.639
Ben tells her everything and convinces her
to help him.

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:54.770
They walk into the freezer room and the pathologist
informs them that he killed himself, but the

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:56.620
police is still investigating.

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:59.940
The pathologist tells Ben that he used a piece
of mirror to do it.

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:03.069
He looks at the body and his reflection says
the word "esseker".

00:06:03.069 --> 00:06:06.639
Ben also asks for his file and manages to
convince Amy to help him.

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:09.860
He looks though the photos of the crime scene
and shows Amy one where the weapon can be

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:10.949
seen.

00:06:10.949 --> 00:06:14.490
Only the reflected weapon has blood on it,
while the real one has none.

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:18.030
Ben has started to think that the mirrors
are showing something that isn't really happening,

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:20.190
making us do things that we don't want to
do.

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:23.650
Amy tells him not to talk like that if he
wants to get reinstated.

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:26.570
He says that he's seeing things and feeling
what they're showing him.

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:29.479
She asks what medication his taking to stop
drinking.

00:06:29.479 --> 00:06:33.040
Ben shows it to her and she says that the
drug has a lot of side effects.

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:36.000
He apologizes for bothering her and thanks
her for trying to help.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.949
Later, Angie is getting ready to take a bath.

00:06:38.949 --> 00:06:43.310
She takes off her robe and walks away to the
tub, with her reflection staying in the mirror.

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:47.380
As soon as she's in, the reflection begins
to tear her face in two, making the same thing

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:49.400
happen to Angie in reality.

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:50.690
She dies in the tub.

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:53.259
Next, the police is there investigating her
death.

00:06:53.259 --> 00:06:56.770
A detective walks into the bathroom and drains
the bathtub.

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:59.250
He reveals her face and sees the damage.

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:02.780
Ben comes home and when the officers restrain
him from going inside the detective comes

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:06.379
out of the apartment and hold them back when
he wrestles out of their hands.

00:07:06.379 --> 00:07:09.220
When he sees the body, he vomits in the sink.

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:12.960
Ben is crying over her body in the mortuary,
while Amy talks to Larry and tells him that

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:14.960
Ben would never hurt his little sister.

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:18.530
Larry says that his story checks out in most
parts, but that his colleague has told the

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:21.080
cops that Ben was planning on leaving the
job.

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:24.819
He tells Amy that they will let him go because
they have no reason to keep him.

00:07:24.819 --> 00:07:28.470
She goes over to him and offer him to stay
with her and the children back at the house,

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:30.540
but he doesn't want to put them in danger.

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:34.510
Ben thinks that the mirror came after Angie,
but Amy misunderstands and tells him to tell

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:35.940
Larry everything.

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:39.130
He doesn't think either of them will believe
him about what he thinks has happened.

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:43.000
That night, Ben is in the store and he's trying
to break the largest mirror.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.180
When it doesn't work, he takes out his gun
and shoots at it, finally making a dent.

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:48.970
But the mirror heals itself.

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:53.300
He keeps banging on it and drops desperate
next to it, asking it what it wants from him.

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:55.870
The mirror writes him a message - the work
"esseker".

00:07:55.870 --> 00:08:00.400
Later, Ben asks Larry to run the name for
him, because he couldn't find it online.

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:04.330
He's doing research on the store and the fire,
but he has trouble connecting the dots.

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:07.910
The man that set the fire in the store kept
claiming that the mirrors are guilty.

00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:11.629
Larry calls him back and tells him that he
didn't find anything on "esseker", so Ben

00:08:11.629 --> 00:08:14.690
tells him to run the name of the arsonist
- Terrence Berry.

00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:18.560
He tells Ben that he's dead, but gives him
the name of the asylum where he was kept.

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:22.039
There, Ben talks to his doctor, who tells
him that the patient thought there were two

00:08:22.039 --> 00:08:23.669
separate realities.

00:08:23.669 --> 00:08:25.400
He shows him the interviews with Berry.

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:29.050
During the interview, the man says that the
mirror killed his family because he couldn't

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:30.449
find "esseker".

00:08:30.449 --> 00:08:34.390
Ben fears for Amy and the kids, so he goes
over to the house and takes out all of the

00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:36.779
mirrors, scaring Rosa and the kids.

00:08:36.779 --> 00:08:39.740
When he can't remove one from his daughters
room he paints over it.

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:43.969
Amy arrives because Rosa called her and she's
pissed at him when she sees what he's doing.

00:08:43.969 --> 00:08:47.480
She asks him to leave and he says that he'll
do it after he covers the mirror.

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:49.760
Amy doesn't understand what is happening to
him.

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:53.140
She tells Ben that Michael is acting strange
because of his influence.

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:56.860
He takes her outside to show her what is happening,
but when he shoots the mirror, it doesn't

00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:58.270
heal itself back.

00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:01.740
The kids are looking at him through the window,
scared about what is happening.

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:05.529
Amy begs him to put the gun away and come
inside, but he drives off.

00:09:05.529 --> 00:09:09.470
In the car, he can't calm himself down and
almost has an accident when he sees Angie

00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:11.010
in the rearview mirror.

00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:13.649
He avoids the accident and destroys the mirror.

00:09:13.649 --> 00:09:17.100
Ben goes back to the store and walks though
the basement looking for something.

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:20.550
He finds an old sign of the psychiatric wing
of the hospital that was there before and

00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:23.690
locates the place where the water in the basement
is coming in.

00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:27.670
He breaks a hole in the wall and enters a
room with a strange contraption inside.

00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:30.500
He steps inside the contraption with a chair
in the middle.

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:34.440
He sees the restraints on it and then notices
that it's surrounded by mirrors.

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:37.399
Ben keeps looking at his reflection and suddenly
it shoots at him.

00:09:37.399 --> 00:09:41.470
Later, he calls Larry again and asks him to
locate the patient-employee manifest for the

00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:43.470
hospital that used to be there.

00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:47.050
Ben tells him to look for a patient or employee
with the name "esseker".

00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:50.060
Before he hangs up, Larry tells him to keep
his head down.

00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:53.570
They meet that night and Larry gives him all
of the medical files he could find on Anna

00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:54.570
Esseker.

00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:58.709
Larry found the files in their evidence storage,
because they were a part of a cold case.

00:09:58.709 --> 00:10:01.540
The girl was only 12 years old when she was
committed.

00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:04.680
She died along with the other patients in
the hospital, who killed each other on the

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:05.740
same night.

00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:08.040
The hospital got closed down after that.

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:12.600
Their doctor was arrested, but he killed himself
with a piece of the cell mirror the next day.

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:15.580
Ben goes back home and investigates Esseker's
files.

00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:19.000
He notices that she's blurry in all of the
pictures from the hospital.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.550
She was committed for schizophrenia with delusional
and violent behavior.

00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:26.550
The only picture he finds from her that isn't
blurry is from the year before she died.

00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:30.290
He finds another file that says that she was
discharged from the hospital two days before

00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:31.560
the massacre.

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:34.829
Suddenly, he hears cracking behind the covers
of his TV.

00:10:34.829 --> 00:10:37.720
He removes them and shows the reflection Anna's
photo.

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:40.070
Ben realizes that Anna is still alive.

00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:43.839
Meanwhile, his daughter is brushing her teeth
in front of a mirror that Amy brought back

00:10:43.839 --> 00:10:45.130
in the house.

00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:48.519
Michael is talking to someone in his room,
sitting in front of the mirror.

00:10:48.519 --> 00:10:51.980
He stands up, but Amy sees his reflection
still in the mirror.

00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:56.010
When the child leaves, she goes over to the
mirror and the reflection smiles at her.

00:10:56.010 --> 00:10:59.570
Amy calls Ben and tells him to come to the
house because she is very scared from what

00:10:59.570 --> 00:11:01.220
she saw in the mirror.

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:04.490
She believes him now and they are both seen
covering up every reflective surface in the

00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:07.300
house - from mirrors to windows and TVs.

00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:10.880
When they're done he says goodbye to the kids,
then to Amy who is sorry that she didn't believe

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:11.880
him.

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:13.839
Ben goes to Pennsylvania to find Anna.

00:11:13.839 --> 00:11:17.110
He turns on a dirt road when he sees her name
on the mail box.

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:20.040
Ben arrives at the house and recognizes it
from the photo.

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:24.060
He knocks on the door and when no one answers
he goes to the window when a dog scares him.

00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:28.540
A boy walks out asking what he wants and Ben
tells him that he's looking for Anna Esseker.

00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:32.089
He tells his mom what Ben is asking for and
she comes out of the house asking what he

00:11:32.089 --> 00:11:33.480
wants from Anna.

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:37.000
Ben lies to her that he's writing a paper
on schizophrenia and she sends the boy in

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.240
to tell his grandfather that someone is asking
about his sister.

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:43.350
The old man takes him down to the basement
where they used to keep her because her fits

00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:44.709
were too violent.

00:11:44.709 --> 00:11:48.630
He tells Ben that they had every priest, healer
and doctor from all over the county, but no

00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:50.060
one could help her.

00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:53.740
Ben steps in and sees the state of the place
where the girl was kept, as her brother tells

00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:57.110
him that Dr. Cain was the only one that answered
their cries for help.

00:11:57.110 --> 00:12:00.399
He didn't believe in demonic possession and
he thought that he could help her.

00:12:00.399 --> 00:12:03.690
Ben asks the brother where she went after
the hospital, but he thinks that she died

00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:04.690
there.

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:08.120
Ben tells the man that he knows she was dismissed
earlier and finds out that she stayed with

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:09.760
them for a little while.

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:13.200
She left because a strange thing began to
happen with the mirrors in the house, while

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:14.959
the girl was totally cured.

00:12:14.959 --> 00:12:18.390
He asks him where he can find her and the
brother tells him that she was sent in a monastery

00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:21.339
where mirrors are forbidden so they can't
get to her.

00:12:21.339 --> 00:12:24.250
Ben gets to the monastery and asks to speak
to Anna.

00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:28.020
Ben tells Anna that he came there to ask her
why the mirrors from the hospital are so desperate

00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:29.170
to find her.

00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:31.470
He begs for her help to save his family.

00:12:31.470 --> 00:12:34.160
Anna tells him that the mirrors are windows
to our world.

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:36.770
What wishes to find her is what is imprisoned
inside them.

00:12:36.770 --> 00:12:40.800
Dr. Cain's therapy consisted in making the
patients remain in a mirrored room for days

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:43.270
on end to rid them from their schizophrenia.

00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:44.610
But he was wrong.

00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:45.950
Anna wasn't cured.

00:12:45.950 --> 00:12:49.279
The demon that was inside of her passed on
into the mirrors and has been collecting the

00:12:49.279 --> 00:12:51.350
souls of those it has killed since.

00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:54.650
She thinks that if she comes back there it
can use her as a vessel to cross the threshold

00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:56.329
back to the real world.

00:12:56.329 --> 00:12:58.910
Ben tries to convince her, but she won't do
it.

00:12:58.910 --> 00:13:02.230
He tells her about all the people that were
murdered and shows her a picture of his family

00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:04.710
so she can understand who he's trying to save.

00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:09.040
Meanwhile, Michael's reflection opens the
door to the room where Amy and the kid are.

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:12.770
Ben calls Amy to tell her about his progress,
but she suddenly realizes that Michael is

00:13:12.770 --> 00:13:14.339
gone from her side.

00:13:14.339 --> 00:13:17.020
When she looks through the door she finds
the house flooded.

00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:19.959
Ben tells her to be careful of the reflections
in the water.

00:13:19.959 --> 00:13:22.630
She sees that the mirrors have been scrapped
off too.

00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:26.040
Ben tells her to find Michael and stay away
from the water and mirrors.

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:29.519
Suddenly, something moves behind her and Amy
drops the phone.

00:13:29.519 --> 00:13:32.529
Ben storms into Anna's room and threatens
her to come with him.

00:13:32.529 --> 00:13:36.140
Simultaneously, Amy is turning off all the
pipes and when she reaches the one in the

00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:39.949
bath, she sees Michael in the reflection,
then gets pushed under the water and begins

00:13:39.949 --> 00:13:41.160
to drown.

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:45.290
At the same time, the daughter hears her voice
calling her and she enters her room.

00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:48.920
When she walks inside, she sees her mom in
the reflection behind her.

00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:52.839
The reflection grabs her and starts cutting
her, when the real Amy comes inside and pulls

00:13:52.839 --> 00:13:54.519
her away from the mirror.

00:13:54.519 --> 00:13:56.740
The reflection is angry that they escaped.

00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:59.980
Amy hides her daughter in the closet and tells
her not to move from there no matter what

00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:01.070
she heats.

00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:02.600
The house keeps flooding.

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:05.560
But Amy walks down to the first floor to find
Michael.

00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:08.420
He's scrapping off the paint from the mirror
with a knife.

00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:11.779
Michael tells Amy not to be scared because
he just wants to play with them.

00:14:11.779 --> 00:14:16.040
He runs away with the knife and she goes after
him, then sees his reflection under the chair,

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:17.710
thinking that he's hiding from her.

00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:19.940
The reflection cuts her and runs away.

00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:22.870
In the meantime, Ben takes Anna back to the
building.

00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:26.370
As soon as they enter, things start appearing
in the mirrors all around.

00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:29.740
They go down to the basement and Ben gets
her to the chair because she keeps her eyes

00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:30.740
shut.

00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:34.450
She tells him to strap her on the chair and
that there is no other way to save his family.

00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:37.269
Back at the house Amy finds Michael sitting
in the water.

00:14:37.269 --> 00:14:40.899
When she approaches him, his reflection looks
at her then pulls him under the water.

00:14:40.899 --> 00:14:43.480
Amy can't get him out, so he drowns.

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:47.199
Anna tells Ben to leave her inside and begins
to pray as the demon pushes through the mirror

00:14:47.199 --> 00:14:48.310
reality.

00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:52.769
She opens her eyes and all the mirrors in
the building explode, killing her in the process.

00:14:52.769 --> 00:14:56.390
Michael is released from the water too and
Amy performs CPR on him until he spits out

00:14:56.390 --> 00:14:57.459
the water.

00:14:57.459 --> 00:15:00.040
The mirrors in the building are completely
destroyed.

00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:03.449
Ben walks inside the mirror chamber, but doesn't
find Anna there.

00:15:03.449 --> 00:15:06.759
He hears something crawling on the walls and
the demon appears in possession of Anna's

00:15:06.759 --> 00:15:07.759
body.

00:15:07.759 --> 00:15:10.029
Ben shoots at it, but it keeps dodging him.

00:15:10.029 --> 00:15:14.339
Eventually it attacks him and throws him out
of the room, then drags him around the basement.

00:15:14.339 --> 00:15:18.120
Ben struggles with the demon, but manages
to push her on to a gas pipe.

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:20.910
He shoots at it and the whole things goes
off in flames.

00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:24.000
The building begins to fall apart as Ben tries
to escape it.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.290
The demon attacks him again, but he pushes
it off and it gets caught under the rubble.

00:15:28.290 --> 00:15:29.779
Ben gets caught as well.

00:15:29.779 --> 00:15:34.759
Fortunately, he pulls himself out of the rubble
and walks outside, where a cop car is waiting.

00:15:34.759 --> 00:15:38.020
Policemen and firemen pass by him, but no
one notices him.

00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:41.880
He walks over to Lorenzo, but sees that his
badge is the wrong way round.

00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:44.120
The signs on the cars are the same way.

00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:47.790
He finally checks the wound on his hand, but
it appears on the wrong one.

00:15:47.790 --> 00:15:50.779
Ben walks outside, but doesn't see his reflection.

00:15:50.779 --> 00:15:56.140
He puts his palm next to a mirror and his
print appears on the other side.
