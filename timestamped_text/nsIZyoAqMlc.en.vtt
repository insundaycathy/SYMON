Welcome back to Mrs Rundown, in today’s
video I am going to be recapping the events

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:09.330
of 10 Things I Hate About You, a 1999 Comedy/Romance
film.

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:10.670
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:11.999
You have been warned.

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.670
Cameron James, the new kid at Padua High School,
is given a tour of the school by Michael Eckman,

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:26.070
who is an audio-visual geek and former leader
of a clique of future MBAs.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.810
Michael provides Cameron with information
on the school’s various cliques.

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:34.310
During the tour, Cameron spots the beautiful
and popular Bianca Stratford and is immediately

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:35.680
smitten with her.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.540
Michael warns that Bianca is shallow, conceited,
and worst of all, not allowed to date.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:46.470
Michael does, however, inform Cameron that
Bianca is looking for a French tutor.

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.940
At the Stratford residence, Bianca’s outcast
older sister Kat receives a letter of acceptance

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.850
to Sarah Lawrence College.

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.710
Her protective father, Walter, is distraught
by the news, as he wants Kat to attend college

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:58.850
nearby.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.710
Kat distracts her father by revealing that
Bianca was given a ride home from school by

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.050
Joey Donner.

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.700
Bianca begs her father to allow her to date,
but to no avail.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.549
Kat's aversion to dating prompts the father
to come up with a new rule: Bianca can only

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.189
date if Kat is dating.

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.780
Cameron starts tutoring Bianca, and she informs
him of her father’s rule after Cameron makes

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.100
many failed attempts to ask her out.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.039
This news motivates Cameron and Michael to
set out to find a boy who is willing to date

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:26.079
Kat.

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:30.680
Cameron suggests Patrick Verona, an outcast
who is just as ill-tempered as Kat.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.009
Cameron tries asking Patrick for his assistance,
but Patrick scares him off.

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.619
Michael then poses the idea to Joey, also
attempting to date Bianca, to pay Patrick

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:40.979
to take Kat out.

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.240
Patrick agrees, but Kat, however, wants nothing
to do with Patrick.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.270
Cameron and Michael finally explain their
situation to Patrick and inform him that Bogie

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.079
Lowenstein is throwing a party (this is actually
a plot by Michael to get revenge, as a rumor

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:56.770
from Bogie had got him kicked out of their
clique).

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.770
Cameron and Michael spread rumors around school
that Bogie's party will have free beer and

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:06.539
dancing, although it is actually a small private
gathering.

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:10.110
At the party, Kat tells Joey to stay away
from her sister.

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.390
Joey brags that he cannot guarantee she'll
stay away from him.

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.950
Kat gets upset and begins drinking, leading
her to dance drunkenly on a table.

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.580
Meanwhile, Cameron discovers that Bianca was
using him to find a date for Kat so that Bianca

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.490
could date Joey.

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:29.270
Cameron decides to stop trying to date Bianca,
but Patrick convinces him to go for it.

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.640
Bianca asks Cameron for a ride home after
discovering Joeys true character.

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.150
Cameron drops her off and tells her that he
really likes her and was very disappointed

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.220
in her.

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.440
At that point Bianca kisses Cameron.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.110
Patrick brings Kat home, and she drunkenly
tries kissing Patrick.

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.050
He suggests they should do that some other
time, hurting Kats feelings.

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.440
The next day at school, Patrick publicly sings
Can't Take My Eyes Off Of You to Kat in front

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.060
of everyone asking her forgiveness, landing
him in detention.

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.340
Kat gets him out of detention by "flashing"
the soccer coach.

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.040
Kat and Patrick spend the day together, and
they both realize that they truly do like

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.330
each other.

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:10.230
Patrick, motivated by Joey's bribe of $300,
asks Kat to the prom.

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.980
However, she is suspicious of his motives
and they get into a fight.

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.120
Bianca tries to convince her father to let
her go to the prom, but he refuses, since

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.710
Kat isnt going.

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:22.410
Bianca confronts Kat.

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.430
Kat then reveals that she dated Joey and they
had sex, mostly because everyone else was

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:27.430
doing it.

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.110
However, when Kat told Joey that she wasn't
ready for sex and did not want to do it again,

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.140
he immediately broke up with her.

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.820
Even though she forbade Joey to tell anyone
of their one time together or else she would

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:42.540
tell all the cheerleaders how tiny he is,
Kat still felt immense rejection, thus spurring

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.610
her to not do anything ever again just because
everyone else was doing it and distanced herself

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.860
from her peers.

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.660
Bianca and Kat end up going to the prom with
Cameron and Patrick.

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:57.640
Joey is furious to learn that Bianca has gone
to prom with Cameron, and confronts Patrick

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.870
about the "arrangement" in front of Kat.

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.170
Kat blows up at Patrick and leaves.

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:06.170
Joey subsequently confronts Cameron about
manipulating the 'deal' for himself, but after

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:11.000
he punches Cameron, Bianca hits Joey three
times herself, leaving him curled up in pain

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.590
on the floor with a broken nose and a black
eye.

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.789
The next morning, Bianca thanks Kat for going
to prom and the sisters make up.

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:21.389
Kat's father allows her to go to Sarah Lawrence.

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:25.970
At school, Kat reads a poem which she wrote
for English class, titled "10 Things I Hate

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:28.159
About You" (written about Patrick).

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:32.409
While reading the poem, she reveals in front
of the entire class how hurt she was by what

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:36.290
Patrick did and how much she really cares
about him ("But mostly I hate the way I don't

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:37.439
hate you.

00:04:37.439 --> 00:04:40.770
Not even close, not even a little bit, not
even at all").

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.560
Patrick is shown to be touched by her revelation.

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.969
In the parking lot, Kat finds a guitar Patrick
bought her with the money Joey paid him, and

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:51.000
he admits that he messed up their deal by
falling for her.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.490
Kat forgives Patrick and the two kiss and
make up.

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:57.810
Thanks for watching!
