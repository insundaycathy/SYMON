00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:02.139
Welcome back to Movie Recaps.

00:00:02.139 --> 00:00:07.830
Today I will show you an action, thriller,
horror film from 2021, titled Blood Red Sky.

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:08.830
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:10.150
Watch out and take care.

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:14.940
An RAF airbase in Scotland is getting prepared
for the landing of a transatlantic flight,

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.490
that has been hijacked.

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.000
Colonel Drummond has been called in to deal
with the situation and as soon as he lands

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.830
an officer informs him that they are working
under the assumption that the pilot and co-pilot

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:24.919
are dead.

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:28.170
He has the information that there is at least
one person on board the plane who is on the

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.240
German terrorist watch list.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.540
As Drummond walks into the control center,
an officer communicates with the plane, explaining

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.830
how they should land while another officer
observes their approach.

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:41.920
The plane lands a little rough, then Drummond
asks his men for a visual and contacts the

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.460
plane asking about the situation on board
when movement suddenly appears near one of

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:46.460
the doors.

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.809
A parachute drops down from it and the soldiers
see a boy climbing down, then is approached

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:54.240
by two RAF trucks ordered by Drummond to get
him out of there.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.820
They see a new subject in the cockpit and
Drummond radios him, saying that they will

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.890
open fire if he moves, instructing him to
climb into the pilot seat and slowly raise

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.039
his hands.

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:06.820
The man asks to be let out of the plane so
he can explain everything to them, insisting

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.220
that he's not a terrorist.

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.180
Later, Drummond sends his translator to talk
to the boy, Elias, who's being examined by

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:14.230
a doctor.

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:17.140
She doesn't learn anything from him because
he's in shock.

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.890
We go back a day earlier in a hotel room and
see Elias's mother, Nadja, in the bathroom

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:23.220
getting ready for the flight.

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.250
Later, she talks to her doctor in New York,
where she and Elias will be traveling for

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.680
the treatment of her mysterious illness.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.070
Elias calls Nadja to tell her that he checked
their luggage, and later she arrives at the

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.290
airport at night, greets her son, then they
pass through airport security and proceed

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.590
to the waiting room where she leaves Elias
and goes to the bathroom before their flight.

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.110
Nadja opens her medicine bag and preps a syringe
with her medicine, then drinks from a bottle,

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.170
instantly feeling the effects of the drink,
then she injects herself with the syringe.

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.660
Farid is on the phone in the waiting room
when Elias begins talking to him, they have

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.220
a fun chat, and then Farid asks him where
his mother is.

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.300
Nadja soon arrives and later they can be seen
going inside the plane and taking their seats.

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.450
Meanwhile, the main stewardess enters through
the cockpit and asks the pilot and co-pilot

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.630
Bastian if they'd like some coffee.

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.150
She goes to the stewardess's station on board
to get it and asks Eightball to take care

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.819
of a sexist passenger in first-class for her.

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:17.540
The plane finally takes off from Germany and
is headed to the US.

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.159
After a few hours, Nadja returns to her seat
from the bathroom and she writes something

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:25.120
down in her notebook, finding a photo from
her and her husband inside.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.010
She remembers him fondly in a sequence of
events that starts benignly and ends up with

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.950
them and their baby being stranded in the
middle of nowhere.

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.020
Her husband leaves to find help and Nadja
stays back with the baby.

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:39.079
During her current flight, she notices a commotion
in the front end of the plane.

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:43.060
Eightball is trying to reason with an unruly
passenger when one of the air marshals subdues

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.840
him and the second air marshal joins them
upfront.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.500
As the air marshals talk to the passenger,
Eightball takes out a knife and kills the

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.819
second marshal, while the passenger overtakes
the first one.

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:56.489
Eightball asks where the third air marshal
is and when he learns the information, he

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:58.719
sends one of his men to take care of her.

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:03.000
Curtiz kills the marshal, takes her gun, and
gives it to and when he gets back to Eightball,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.249
the maniac kills the remaining air marshal
violently to the disgust of Karl.

00:03:07.249 --> 00:03:08.989
Nadja senses something is happening.

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:13.470
Suddenly, Eightball walks back to the passengers
and tells them to remain seated while he flings

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:14.719
a gun at them.

00:03:14.719 --> 00:03:18.530
His conspirators join him and make everybody
go into the back of the plane.

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.940
Berg goes to the cockpit and knocks on the
door when Bastian opens it for him and tells

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.499
him that he killed the pilot.

00:03:23.499 --> 00:03:27.120
They open the hatch and throw him down into
the other level of the plane, then Berg makes

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.730
an announcement to the passengers that they
have taken over and orders the passengers

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.030
to put their hands on the seat in front of
them.

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.010
The bearded guy Yuri finds the black box and
reprograms it, then tells Berg about it in

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:38.150
the cockpit.

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.340
The co-pilot turns the plane.

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.510
Elias gets scared for his mom even though
she tells him not to worry, but he checks

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.920
the plane schematics and tells her where she
can hide from the sunlight.

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.569
Curtiz gets Farid to get up and move to the
front of the plane, while Karl tries to calm

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:53.239
Eightball and Elias escapes from his seat.

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:57.209
Nadja goes after Elias and Eightball after
them, then he still shoots her in front of

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:58.209
Elias.

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:01.939
He grabs the boy and Karl puts him back in
his seat, telling him to stay there.

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:05.440
Berg meets Curtiz halfway to the back and
Curtiz tells him what happened.

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.549
Berg approaches Eightball and tells him that
if he does something like that again he'll

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:12.470
kill him, but he still uses Nadja's death
as an example to the other passengers.

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:17.400
In a flashback, we go back to the car where
Nadja is waiting with her baby for her husband

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.180
to get help back to them.

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.820
After waiting for a while, she leaves the
car and walks into the woods, following in

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.820
her husband's footsteps.

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:28.330
Nadja comes upon an abandoned house and thinks
she'll find him there.

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.510
Inside of the house she sees blood on the
floor and follows a line of it down toward

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:35.350
the basement when a vampire comes out of nowhere
and chases her down.

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:38.640
She locks herself in the basement where she
finds her husband, dead.

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:42.340
The creature tries to come in through a window
and Nadja goes to fight it off, but it bites

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.790
her before it gets killed by the sunlight.

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:47.290
She wakes up in the plane - alive.

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:50.640
Nadja hears dogs in the hold and drops down
into it through a hatch.

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:55.440
Meanwhile, Berg forces Farid and two other
men into reading a terrorist-sounding message.

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.280
Back in the hold, Nadja hides under a car
as Curtiz and Yuri come down looking for tools

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.850
to build a bomb.

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:04.090
Yuri sets it up as Nadja gets to one of the
dogs and feasts on it.

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:07.990
The dog makes enough noises to piss off Yuri
and make him come back to find Nadja hiding

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.930
behind a car, who then attacks him and kills
him.

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:15.410
Simultaneously, Farid gets back to the other
passengers and heads straight to Elias, sitting

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:17.050
down next to him.

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:21.090
Nadja begins to change into her vampire form
rapidly, feeling her teeth coming in so she

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:24.980
finds the medicine and gets ready to inject
it when she hears Berg call Yuri, telling

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:27.370
him that there are 10 minutes to the jump.

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:31.430
Nadja goes back to Yuri's body and drinks
his blood, speeding up her transformation,

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:33.900
then she walks back to the other part of the
plane.

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.560
The hijackers lie to the passengers that they
will set off a nerve gas if they move from

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.620
their seats, then they proceed to the hold
where they find Yuri with a dog next to him,

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:44.340
which Nadja has set loose to look like it
killed him.

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:48.040
She gets in the back of the plane to get Elias,
freaking out the other passengers that she'll

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:49.790
set off the gas.

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:53.230
Nadja and Elias go to the cockpit where they
discover that the pilots have left so she

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:57.000
comes back to the passengers and asks for
someone that can fly a plane.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.470
One of the men says that he can do it and
goes with Nadja, as Farid tells the other

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:03.190
passengers about what he read in the statement.

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:06.880
Nadja and the guy go to the cockpit, and she
locks the doors before Farid can join them

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:07.880
there.

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.730
In the meantime, the hijackers get into their
scuba gear and are ready to jump, while Berg

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:14.950
communicates with the man that will pick them
up from the ocean.

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:19.420
Nadja continues to transform in the cockpit,
worrying Elias, when the guy realizes that

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:20.850
they're on autopilot.

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:24.760
She sees the hijackers on the security monitors
and tells him to wait for them to jump before

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:26.100
he turns it off.

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:29.940
Eightball has figured out that she isn't dead
and comes back to the plane with Berg, looking

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:31.030
for her.

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:34.280
One of the passengers tells them that she's
in the cockpit so they go there and ask her

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:35.890
to open the door.

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:39.460
Nadja tells the man to turn the plane around
toward the US again, even though he tells

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:41.260
her they're closer to Europe.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:45.510
He's scared of her so he obliges her command
and when the hijackers notice the plane turning,

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:47.480
Berg threatens to kill a passenger.

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:51.510
He shoots him and tells Nadja that they'll
keep killing others until she opens the door,

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:53.700
then tells Eightball to get him another one.

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:57.680
The psychopath finds a little girl and brings
her to Berg who shows her to Nadja.

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:01.690
He begins the countdown and before he can
shoot the girl, Nadja jumps out of the cockpit

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:05.501
and attacks him, biting straight into his
neck, scaring the hell out of Bastian and

00:07:05.501 --> 00:07:06.660
the others.

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:10.740
The guy in the cockpit shuts and locks the
door again with Elias inside.

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:14.140
Nadja finishes drinking Berg's blood and then
goes after the rest of them who run back to

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:15.370
the hold.

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:19.160
Berg begins changing and when she hears it,
Nadja goes back to kill him, with Eightball

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:20.820
seeing it all happen.

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:24.590
She goes back to the door and tells Elias
not to open it because he's safer there, then

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:28.350
goes into the lavatory and sees how much her
transformation has progressed.

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:32.240
Eightball asks to see her bag and comes back
down to the other hijackers reading from her

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:33.340
notebook.

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:37.030
He says that she's a vampire, but since Karl
didn't see what happened he doesn't believe

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:39.480
the rest when they tell him what Nadja did.

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:43.800
Karl is too caught up with how maniacal Eightball
is, who shows the others a UV light to hurt

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:44.800
Nadja.

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:48.410
She injects herself with the medicine and
goes into another flashback.

00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:52.390
Nadja tries to take care of Elias as a baby,
while also feeding herself.

00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:56.300
As the baby keeps crying, she hisses at it
but then goes to the bathroom to rip her fangs

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:58.340
out so she doesn't hurt him.

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:02.390
One day, Nadja goes back to the house where
she got turned, when the father of the vampire

00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:03.990
that made her shows up.

00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:08.540
The man tells her that his son couldn't control
himself and neither can he despite his appearance.

00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:12.530
The man shoots her, saying that they are all
cursed and bring only suffering.

00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:16.190
Back at the plane, Eightball is making a stake
and the others are arguing over what to do

00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:17.200
now.

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:20.860
Karl convinces Bastian that their only chance
is to get back in the cockpit and get the

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:22.780
plane back on course.

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:26.520
Elias gets out of the cockpit, ignoring the
pleas from the guy to stay inside, and gets

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:29.350
his mother out of the bathroom, dragging her
back.

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:32.899
The hijackers get back up and when the guy
sees them he locks himself back up in the

00:08:32.899 --> 00:08:34.110
cockpit.

00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:38.169
Nadja rises and goes toward Eightball who's
waiting for her with a stake and a UV light.

00:08:38.169 --> 00:08:42.139
He burns her and she faints, so he tells the
others to take control back, while he stays

00:08:42.139 --> 00:08:44.149
behind to figure out what she is.

00:08:44.149 --> 00:08:47.980
Eightball finds a syringe and fills it with
her blood and when he wants to stake her,

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:50.060
Elias shows up threatening him with a gun.

00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:53.790
The psychopath goes toward Elias and when
he reaches for the gun, it shoots the window

00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:57.209
open and the plane destabilizes because of
the pressure drop.

00:08:57.209 --> 00:09:00.900
Bastian tells the others that they have oxygen
for only 10 more minutes and they have to

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:02.540
get the plane lower.

00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:07.589
Nadja gets Elias to an oxygen mask, takes
the gun, and shoots Eightball, who runs away.

00:09:07.589 --> 00:09:11.431
Simultaneously, the guy in the cockpit passes
out because he can't hold the door and get

00:09:11.431 --> 00:09:15.810
to a mask at the same time, which allows the
hijackers to get back inside.

00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:19.509
Nadja brings Elias to the other part of the
plane and gives him over to Farid as the plane

00:09:19.509 --> 00:09:21.430
suddenly loses altitude.

00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:25.330
She goes after Eightball and finds him inside
a bulletproof car, so no matter how much she

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:27.480
shoots at him, nothing happens.

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:31.180
The maniac injects himself with her blood
even though she begs him not to do it.

00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:35.800
Eightball immediately begins to turn and Nadja
figures out what she has to do to stop him.

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:39.800
She finds matches and alcohol, then comes
back and pours it inside the car, lighting

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:41.540
Eightball on fire.

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:45.010
Nadja remembers the old vampire telling her
that they cannot let their evil spread and

00:09:45.010 --> 00:09:46.399
they must stop it.

00:09:46.399 --> 00:09:50.279
She begins smashing his face and before she
strikes the final blow, the man says that

00:09:50.279 --> 00:09:52.839
she cannot control the evil inside of her.

00:09:52.839 --> 00:09:56.709
The plane finally stabilizes, but the hijackers
see that there is a fire in the hold though

00:09:56.709 --> 00:10:02.139
before they come down, Nadja has already contained
the fire and is crawling back inside the plane.

00:10:02.139 --> 00:10:05.990
The hijackers shoot at Nadja and the passengers
freak out so they stampede toward the front

00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:08.850
of the plane, including Farid carrying Elias.

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:12.579
The hijackers find Eightball in the car alive
when he suddenly attacks Curtiz and drunks

00:10:12.579 --> 00:10:15.809
his blood, then gets out and goes after the
others.

00:10:15.809 --> 00:10:19.350
Nadja secures the door to the hold and hears
Elias yelling after her that the passengers

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:20.610
want to kill her.

00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:24.399
Farid however calls out saying that they won't
hurt her, clearly not on the same page as

00:10:24.399 --> 00:10:26.710
the others, one of which shoots her.

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:30.100
She attacks the other one and they try to
contain her, but she just breaks free and

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:31.910
goes after Farid.

00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:35.519
Elias convinces her not to kill him as the
other man points a gun at her.

00:10:35.519 --> 00:10:38.790
Nadja hears the other vampires in the hold
and says that they can't let them come back

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:42.779
on board so she runs down and tries to contain
Eightball behind a door.

00:10:42.779 --> 00:10:47.029
Farid runs to her aid and gets bitten by Eithball
who gets shot by the other guy when he pushes

00:10:47.029 --> 00:10:48.540
through the door.

00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:52.639
Nadja chops off Farid's hand to stop the spread
to the rest of his body while Curtiz, now

00:10:52.639 --> 00:10:56.349
fully turned, tries to get back into the plane
from below.

00:10:56.349 --> 00:11:00.089
Nadja manages to put him and Eightball back
down, saving the stewardess from becoming

00:11:00.089 --> 00:11:01.680
vampire grub.

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:05.889
After that, she goes back to the passengers
and finds Bastian, while Farid reassures them

00:11:05.889 --> 00:11:07.779
that she's on their side.

00:11:07.779 --> 00:11:10.999
Nadja takes him back to the cockpit where
he tells her that they have to find the nearest

00:11:10.999 --> 00:11:13.920
airport to land because they are running low
on fuel.

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:17.740
Farid and Elias convince her to go below the
cockpit where it's dark as he stays behind

00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:19.060
with Bastian.

00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:22.959
The moment that the pilot gets a signal from
the nearby RAF airbase he tells them that

00:11:22.959 --> 00:11:26.500
they have been hijacked, but that they were
able to overpower the hijackers and lock them

00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:28.019
in the cargo hold.

00:11:28.019 --> 00:11:32.130
Meanwhile, Elias goes up to look for his mother's
medicine while the passengers hear the vampires

00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:33.959
rampaging in the hold.

00:11:33.959 --> 00:11:37.999
One of the hurt passengers decides to go down
to the vampires because he's dying and releases

00:11:37.999 --> 00:11:40.029
Eightball, asking to be bitten.

00:11:40.029 --> 00:11:43.699
Eightball just storms past him and attacks
the other passengers.

00:11:43.699 --> 00:11:47.410
Nadja and Farid see that the airplane has
turned into complete pandemonium as the other

00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:50.879
passengers flock to the cockpit doors, trying
to get in.

00:11:50.879 --> 00:11:54.529
Bastian doesn't allow them to open the door
and Nadja realizes that they shouldn’t land

00:11:54.529 --> 00:11:56.769
the plane because the vampires would get out.

00:11:56.769 --> 00:12:00.290
Farid thinks that they should land the plane
and then blow it up remotely so they go to

00:12:00.290 --> 00:12:04.139
the fuel tank to set up the explosive and
realize that they have a detonator but no

00:12:04.139 --> 00:12:05.139
timer.

00:12:05.139 --> 00:12:08.360
Nadja volunteers to blow up the plane manually
when all of them get out of the plane and

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:10.839
explains to Elias that it must be done.

00:12:10.839 --> 00:12:14.970
The boy isn't interested in leaving his mother
to die, so he runs down into the hold to find

00:12:14.970 --> 00:12:18.449
the hijacker's timer, protecting himself with
a UV light.

00:12:18.449 --> 00:12:23.050
The vampires in the hold go after Elias, but
he manages to dodge all of them.

00:12:23.050 --> 00:12:26.589
Elias finds the right tool and starts coming
back to the cockpit when the vampires attack

00:12:26.589 --> 00:12:28.490
him and he drops the light.

00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:32.139
Nadja sees what is happening from the cockpit
and decides to help Elias.

00:12:32.139 --> 00:12:35.569
She asks Bastian if the airplane is on the
right track and he tells her that it's on

00:12:35.569 --> 00:12:40.160
autopilot, explaining that with traffic control
anyone can land the plane at this point.

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:43.879
Nadja turns to Farid and makes him promise
that he will take care of her son, then feeds

00:12:43.879 --> 00:12:47.519
on Bastian, knowing that it will make her
transformation final.

00:12:47.519 --> 00:12:50.740
Elias gets attacked by the other vampires
when Eightball hears him scream and claims

00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:52.350
him for himself.

00:12:52.350 --> 00:12:56.519
Before he can get to the boy, Nadja attacks
him and the two vampires fight in the hold.

00:12:56.519 --> 00:13:00.380
Eightball bites into her when Elias gets the
idea to blow out the hold door so his mother

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:02.129
can push Eightball out of there.

00:13:02.129 --> 00:13:06.290
Meanwhile, Farid sees that the boy is left
alone in the hold with his mother when Eightball

00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:09.189
crawls back inside the plane and goes after
the boy.

00:13:09.189 --> 00:13:13.490
Farid turns off the autopilot and turns the
plane sideways, killing Eightball by exposing

00:13:13.490 --> 00:13:15.269
him to the sunlight.

00:13:15.269 --> 00:13:18.860
Elias feeds his mother his own blood and she
wakes up, barely controlling herself not to

00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:20.330
feed on him more.

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:23.329
She pushes him away and crawls back into the
hold.

00:13:23.329 --> 00:13:27.990
Back in the RAF base, Elias asks the translator
about Farid and begs her to get him out, but

00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:32.389
the racist tells him that no matter what Farid
has told him that he's one of the bad guys.

00:13:32.389 --> 00:13:36.339
Elias tells her that they have to save him
from the vampires before the sun goes down.

00:13:36.339 --> 00:13:39.060
They sedate the boy and Drummond gets back
to control.

00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:43.589
He orders his officers to wait while the vampires
on the plane feed of the remaining bodies.

00:13:43.589 --> 00:13:47.310
The army keeps talking to Farid and tries
to convince him to hand himself over, not

00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:50.540
understanding what is happening, nor listening
to his pleas.

00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:54.339
They finally shoot him down and get to the
plane, coming inside and taking him out before

00:13:54.339 --> 00:13:55.740
he can blow it up.

00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:59.449
The soldiers get inside the plane unaware
of what is waiting for them there.

00:13:59.449 --> 00:14:03.720
As the boy gets driven to a hospital, Elias
manages to sedate the paramedic with the sedative

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:05.220
that was meant for him.

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:08.540
He grabs his teddy bear and jumps out, running
toward the plane.

00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:13.040
The soldiers get attacked by the vampires,
not listening to what Farid is telling them.

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:16.449
Moments later, he sees Elias from the back
of the truck but the boy doesn't hear him

00:14:16.449 --> 00:14:17.829
call for him.

00:14:17.829 --> 00:14:22.180
When Elias reaches the plane, he sees his
mom feed on a soldier and calls for her.

00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:26.460
When he realizes that she's not really his
mom anymore, Elias blows up the plane, to

00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:28.790
the surprise of Drummond and his men.

00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:36.320
With his final strength, Farid finds Elias
next to the rubble and they embrace.
