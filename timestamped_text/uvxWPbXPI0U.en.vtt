00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.529
Welcome Back to another Movie Recap. Today
we look at a Horror, Mystery Thriller, called

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:06.819
Knock Knock, starring Keanu Reeves.

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:12.800
Spoilers ahead, so watch out and take care.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.870
The movie opens with photo’s showing a loving
family. A beautiful wife and beautiful kids

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:21.470
in a stereotypical suburban American home,
with a few more quirks dotted around the house.

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.830
We then join Keanu Reeves, playing Evan, fooling
around in bed with his stunning wife before

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.890
they are interrupted by their two children
to wish Evan a Happy Father’s Day. A Beautiful

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:30.890
little family.

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.170
We see a loving father, with a loving family.

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.070
Karen, Evans’s wife and kids are set to
go away for the Weekend while Evan has to

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:38.370
stay home and work.

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.860
Lewis a family friend drops off some books
that Karen has had produced.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.010
A statue arrives for the garden before the
family leave to go to the sea, while Evan

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.620
and their dog stay home alone. They drive
off for a lovely weekend.

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.370
That night sees a heavy thunderstorm, Evan
is listening to music while home alone and

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.280
working on his computer when his family facetime
him.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.951
From outside the house, you are given the
impression someone is looking inside, but

00:00:59.951 --> 00:01:01.030
you don’t know who.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.530
While back at work designing a house and having
a smoke the music goes off and he hears a

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.900
knock at the front door.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.510
When he opens the door, he is presented with
two stunning young ladies who have been drenched

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:10.860
in the current downpour.

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.860
They ask for a family name that he’s unaware
of, they claim a taxi had dropped them off

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.080
and they are lost. One of the ladies’ sneezes
and he hands her a handkerchief, before allowing

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.810
them to come in and use his phone.

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.430
They then ask to use his computer, which he
agrees.

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.590
When inside, he goes to grab them some towels
to dry off as well as an iPad to help them

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.490
find the address they are looking for.

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.900
Bell introduces herself while Genesis uses
the iPad. Within moments Bell starts to flirt

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.210
with Evan, which he seems oblivious to.

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.770
They claim the address they wanted is miles
away and Evan orders them an Uber which will

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.210
be 45 minutes.

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.100
They ask to throw their clothes in to Evans’s
dryer, which he awkwardly agrees too before

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.810
grabbing them some robes.

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.790
Both ladies join Evan, who is making them
a hot drink while they are in their new robes.

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.680
He puts their clothes in the dryer, when he
returns, they are dancing to music and playing

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.710
with the family dog, called Monkey.

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.420
Evan’s tells the ladies he used to be a
DJ when he was younger and that he is now

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.610
43. He tells them his family are away at present
before the ladies come in for a hug making

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.360
him feel uncomfortable and continue to flirt
with him.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.789
They look at a picture of Karen while they
look at all the sculptures she created.

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.750
The flirting continues and Bell swiftly turns
the conversation to Sex and how he must do

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.660
it all the time with his wife. Evan tries
to shrug off the flirting while the Uber is

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.140
still 20 minutes away.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.690
Genesis and Bell try and make threesomes a
normal thing and that being with only one

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.150
person isn’t natural.

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.390
They tell Evan they are both flight attendants
as they continue to flirt.

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.790
You can see in Evan’s eyes he is starting
to fall for their flirtatious selves, with

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.990
the uber only 5 minutes away Genesis goes
to the bathroom.

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:38.740
Bell has Evan put on a different piece of
music; she starts to dance in a provocative

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:41.230
manner all while Evan’s eyes are drawn to
her.

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.350
He starts to show off his DJ skills as she
dances for him.

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.910
Bell pulls Evan in to dance as she tells him
how good of a time they are all having, she

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.000
removes her gum as she goes in to kiss him.
He pulls away at the last second, just as

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.300
the Uber arrives.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.110
Evan grabs their clothes, as he gives them
the clothes, they are both naked in the shower

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:01.720
waiting for him. As they continue to touch
him, he tries to stop them time and time again,

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.840
but soon he comes under their seduction and
ends up sleeping with them both, first in

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.820
the shower and then in the family bed.

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:10.090
We then cut to Evan in bed with them both
asleep.

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.900
In the morning Evan is in bed alone, he wakes
up, his wedding ring on the sideboard and

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.680
missed messages from his wife.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.490
He hoes to find both Bell and Genesis, he
approaches them in a rage as they are making

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:22.230
breakfast in his kitchen and acting very childish.

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.570
The kitchen has been trashed as they continue
to act like children and referring to him

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:26.570
as daddy.

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:30.220
He takes a call from his wife in the garden
as both Bell and Genesis try and distract

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:31.220
him.

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.770
He returns inside in anger, trying to get
them both to leave, which is proving extremely

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:35.770
difficult.

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:38.740
Bell continues to try and seduce him as he’s
trying to get them to leave.

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:43.020
He waits outside for them both, but they don’t
show up. He finds them damaging his wife’s

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:44.020
statue.

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:47.480
As he tries to call their parents, they tell
him they are both only 15 and that if he calls

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.760
anyone they will tell them he is a predator.
Telling him he will get minimum 15 to 20 years

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:52.760
in prison.

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.490
They tell him they lied about being flight
attendants. He tries to pay them to leave.

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:57.730
They tell him they are not hookers.

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:02.870
Viviane, a family friend arrives, but he tells
her she can’t come in, it’s then Genesis

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.640
comes out while caressing him. She leaves
in anger.

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.700
Back inside Evan is angry and tries to force
them to leave. In anger he starts to choke

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.960
Genesis, but she tells him he doesn’t have
it in him before he releases her. He’s notably

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.390
upset and frustrated.

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:19.870
Evan calls 911, but Genesis hangs up the phone
before asking for a ride.

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.710
After an awkward car ride, he drops them off
at what he believes is their home. As soon

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.350
as they are out of the car he drives off.
They don’t enter the house but swiftly walk

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:28.350
away.

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:31.930
Evan cleans up his family home as if nothing
had happened, trying to forget the previous

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:32.930
night.

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.840
He finishes cleaning up his home and returns
to work. He hears a noise and investigates,

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.000
now paranoid.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.850
In the room he see’s a family photo smashed
on the floor; it’s then Genesis knocks him

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.000
unconscious from behind with a sculpture.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.220
They tie him to the bed; he wakes up as Genesis
is doing her makeup. He can’t get free as

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:49.470
he claims he’s a good person.

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:54.020
He can’t free himself. Bell joins him wearing
his daughters school uniform and calling him

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.889
Daddy. She removes her underwear before standing
over him.

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:01.060
He asks to be untied as Bell tells him she
loves him as Genesis doesn’t. He can’t

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.780
free himself. He continues to beg to be freed.

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:07.000
Genesis writes ‘It was not a dream’ on
the mirror as Bell slaps Evan.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.790
It’s then they hear his phone that he’s
laid on. It’s his wife on facetime. The

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:14.260
agree not to answer the phone as long as Evan
sleeps with Bell again.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:18.810
As Bell sleeps with Evan as he’s tied up,
Genesis disappears. Evan is able to free himself

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:23.520
and knocks Bell from him. He goes after Genesis,
who is eating cake. As he goes to strangle

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.889
her, she stabs him with a knife. Bell joins
them and tells him he must be punished.

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:32.080
They tie Evan to a chair and pretend to play
a game. They then torture him with noises,

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:33.590
nearly damaging his hearing.

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:37.310
The questions and the punishment continue,
asking him questions about how he should be

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:40.780
punished, including prison or death, he doesn’t
answer.

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:42.690
It’s then Lewis turns up at the door.

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:46.430
They cover Evan up. Lewis enters the house
and Genesis pretends she is their filming

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:49.290
a music video, which Lewis believes.

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:53.680
As Lewis goes outside to collect the sculpture,
he finds it covered in paint and damaged.

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:57.570
He starts to panic and needs his inhaler.
They tell him it was vandals who broke in,

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:59.520
they then start to try and seduce Lewis.

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:04.470
Lewis hears Evan who is tied up, as he’s
untying him, they start to destroy the sculpture,

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:08.050
he goes to stop them, but they’ve taken
his inhaler and he can’t breathe. As he

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:12.010
tries to get it back, he falls and cracks
his head open, killing him.

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:14.250
Both Bell and Genesis can’t stop laughing.

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:18.229
As Evan watches on they turn Lewis’s body
into a sculpture and send a fake message from

00:06:18.229 --> 00:06:22.460
Evan to Lewis, telling him he will kill him
if he sleeps with his wife again and that

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:26.020
he better disappear. They then load Lewis’s
body into his own van.

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:27.780
They then want to continue the ‘gameshow’.

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:31.169
They tell him how much of a bad person he
is for sleeping with them and that he doesn’t

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:32.169
deserve his family.

00:06:32.169 --> 00:06:34.440
They tell him he deserves death for his actions.

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:38.229
He gets angry and starts to blame them for
what happened. He tells them he tries to be

00:06:38.229 --> 00:06:40.300
a good guy, but that they seduced him.

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:43.850
They then tell him he will be executed at
Dawn before Bell calls him Daddy yet again.

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:47.800
Bell and Genesis then dig what appears to
be a grave in the back garden. While looking

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:52.060
on Evan sees his iPad and tries to get it.
He uses voice control to try and call his

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:55.660
wife, as it starts calling, they return and
throw it in the garden.

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:59.040
They then admit to spying on Evan prior to
the night they arrived at his house.

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:02.840
They change into new clothes and destroy more
statues in the garden as time swiftly ticks

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:07.009
by. They destroy the house, cut his hair,
and continue to act like children.

00:07:07.009 --> 00:07:10.720
They continue to do more and more damage and
morning swiftly approaches. It’s then they

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:12.250
find a gun in a statue.

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:14.290
Genesis gets Bell to untie Evan.

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:18.320
Evan asks what they want, and Genesis tells
him she wants to play hide and seek. They

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:22.449
tell him he has 30 seconds. If they find him,
they will kill him, but if he survives the

00:07:22.449 --> 00:07:25.960
90 minutes till sunrise they will leave, and
he will live.

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:29.940
They continue to search for him, moving from
room to room. Evan tries to leave the house

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:31.211
but falls, they catch him.

00:07:31.211 --> 00:07:35.900
It’s sunrise, a wide shot of the estate
shows the calm beauty, before it cuts back

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:39.290
to Genesis and Bell rolling Evan into the
grave they had made for him.

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:42.479
They sit him up, only his head above the hole
as they fill the hole in.

00:07:42.479 --> 00:07:46.340
His head above the ground he begs them, they
remove his gag. They tell him he must call

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:49.139
his family and tell them what happened. He
agrees.

00:07:49.139 --> 00:07:52.530
He goes to leave a message, but he yells for
them to call 911.

00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:56.070
They re-insert his gag and tell him ‘Knock
Knock’. They tell him cheating will eventually

00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:59.380
get him killed as they are about to hit him
over the head with a heavy statue.

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:03.520
They smash it down but miss him intentionally.
He’s petrified and crying as they laugh.

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:06.199
They tell him it’s just a game and he’s
not their first victim.

00:08:06.199 --> 00:08:09.400
They tell him they are not killers; they tell
him they thought he’d be the first to say

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:12.050
no, but he didn’t and that they are all
the same.

00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:16.110
As they leave, they tell Evan they are 22
and show him his phone, on it is a video on

00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:18.660
his social media of him sleeping with them
both.

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:22.360
Bell and Genesis grab monkey before leaving
as Evan is left to watch on as he watches

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:24.259
the video of him sleeping with them.

00:08:24.259 --> 00:08:28.770
The movie ends, the house destroyed and Evans’s
life in ruin just as his wife and family return

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:29.860
home to see everything.

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:32.159
A crazy ending to a crazy movie!
