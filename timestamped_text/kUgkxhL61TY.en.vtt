00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:12.440
Hey everyone. Welcome back to Movie Recap.
Today I'm gonna show you a movie called, RoboCop.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:19.349
It is a 2014 American superhero film, directed
by Jos Padilha starring Joel Kinnaman.

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:24.570
Television personality Pat Novak starts off
an episode of his show, "The Novak Element"

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.679
by pointing out that every country in the
world except for the United States is under

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:34.480
high security with droids from multinational
conglomerate OmniCorp.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.800
The action shifts to Tehran, where one OmniCorp
employee, Rick Maddox is handing out red asset

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.320
bracelets to Kelly Perkins, one of Novak's
reporters and camera crews as they observe

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.300
the large droids and other robots doing a
scan on citizens in the area. From inside

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:55.050
a compound, a mother and her son, Navid, watch
the droids do their work. Navid's father Arash

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.670
leads a group of suicide bombers outside to
capture themselves getting killed live on

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.300
international television. They launch their
attack, with all the bombers getting themselves

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:10.050
killed by the droids, though they succeed
in taking out some of the EM-208 droids themselves.

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:15.430
Navid runs out with a knife in hand and is
gunned down by one of the ED-209s on patrol.

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.190
The camera crew captures all of this.

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.800
Novak continues by admiring how the droids
handled the situation, pointing out that OmniCorp

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.400
CEO Raymond Sellars has the right idea to
push forward for use of these droids in the

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.030
U.S., but Senator Hubert Dreyfuss is against
it, having issued the Dreyfuss Act to prevent

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.820
this type of law enforcement. Novak ends by
asking why America is so robophobic.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:46.170
In Detroit, Detroit Police Department detective
Alex Murphy walks to a meeting with Chief

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:52.390
Karen Dean. In her office are two other cops,
John Lake and Andre Daniels. Dean reprimands

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.000
Murphy for the events of the previous night.
Murphy and his partner Jack Lewis had gotten

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.840
into a shootout with men working for crime
boss Antoine Vallon, killing six of them and

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.430
critically wounding Lewis. Lake and Daniels
are not happy with Murphy for intruding on

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.979
their investigation into Vallon, but Murphy
counters that their inability to produce an

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:16.500
arrest on Vallon after two years of investigation
suggests them to be dirty. Once Lake and Daniels

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.690
leave the office, Murphy tells his story.

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.310
Murphy's story is told in flashback. He and
Lewis have been undercover to crack down on

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.670
shipments of illegal firearms. Posing as buyers,
they interview a dealer named Jerry White,

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.040
but they begin to think he's selling dirty
weapons. Acting like they believe Jerry is

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.360
an undercover cop, they scare him into revealing
that he works for Antoine Vallon. Murphy and

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.190
Lewis run the serial numbers of the weapons
being sold and discover something shocking:

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.120
they are guns that should have been locked
up in the evidence room, which means Vallon's

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:55.070
got cops on his payroll.

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:59.380
Against their better judgment, Murphy and
Lewis go to a restaurant to meet with Vallon.

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.740
Lewis insists that they need backup, since
Vallon's guys might shoot them for target

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:10.120
practice, but Murphy thinks calling for backup
will tip Vallon off.

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:15.060
The meeting starts smoothly. Vallon and his
right hand man hear Murphy and Lewis out,

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:20.080
and appear to fall for their undercover identities.
Unfortunately, just as they're about to close

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:25.700
the deal, somebody betrays Murphy and Lewis
to Vallon and notifies Vallon by smartphone.

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.250
Vallon immediately leaves the table just as
a few cars pull up in front of the restaurant,

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:35.340
and a group of gunmen armed with pistols and
submachine guns open fire. Murphy and Lewis

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.190
return fire with their pistols, pinned down
in one of the booths. After a lengthy exchange

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.980
of gunfire, during which several henchmen
are killed, Murphy escapes outside by jumping

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.209
through a glass window into an alleyway. A
couple of henchmen are waiting in the alley

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:56.320
to ambush him. Murphy uses a dumpster as a
shield while advancing on and shooting at

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:01.500
the henchmen. He kills two of them, and the
remaining one escapes by foot. Lewis prepares

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:06.201
to follow Murphy when a henchman hiding in
the kitchen bursts out and fires on him. He

00:04:06.201 --> 00:04:11.990
manages to return fire and kill the henchman,
but in the process is shot in his right shoulder.

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:18.630
Murphy stays with him until an ambulance can
arrive, and Vallon manages to escape.

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.949
In the present, Chief Dean reminds Murphy
that he isn't supposed to carry out such an

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:26.810
assignment without talking to her first.

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:31.470
In Washington, DC, Sellars is testifying in
front of a Senate subcomittee hearing with

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:36.509
Senator Dreyfuss in regards to the matter
of using OmniCorp droids as law enforcement.

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:40.780
Dreyfuss argues that a machine could not feel
anything if it were to kill anybody, even

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:46.029
a child, and Sellars reluctantly admits as
much. On return to Detroit, Sellars meets

00:04:46.029 --> 00:04:51.099
up with his marketing associates, Liz Kline
and Tom Pope. Realizing that more than half

00:04:51.099 --> 00:04:55.969
of the country's population will not stand
behind robots protecting their streets, Sellars

00:04:55.969 --> 00:05:01.509
proposes that they get a man into a machine.

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:05.949
At the OmniCorp rehab center, Dr. Dennett
Norton and his assistant Jae Kim are tending

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:11.009
to a man who has had his arms replaced with
artificial robotic limbs. Although he is nervous

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:16.120
to use them at first, Dr. Norton convinces
him to give it a go. The man starts to play

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:21.060
the guitar, and he and his wife are overcome
with joy. The man's emotional levels begin

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:26.699
to rise, which would interfere with the program.
He tones it down but then says he needs emotions

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:32.789
to play. Dr. Norton is then called away by
Sellars. They, along with Kline and Pope,

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:37.159
review potential amputee candidates for the
man-in-a-machine program, all of them veteran

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:41.789
police officers, but Dr. Norton and Sellars
reject each one either due to their physical

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:45.249
form or their psychological screenings.

00:05:45.249 --> 00:05:50.870
Meanwhile, it's revealed to us that the two
officers Chief Dean shooed out of her office

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:55.840
earlier, Lake and Daniels, are the men who
betrayed Murphy to Vallon. They meet Vallon

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:00.570
at a bar, where he gently chides them for
not warning him sooner. He considers bribing

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:06.009
Murphy to get him in line, but Daniels counters
that that's not an option, as Murphy is going

00:06:06.009 --> 00:06:10.319
to come down harder on Vallon from here on
out. The two detectives think it would be

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:15.189
easier to just kill Murphy, an idea that Vallon
initially is hesitant to on the grounds of

00:06:15.189 --> 00:06:19.139
the increased attention he'll get from the
cops until Lake and Daniels remind him that

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:23.800
they're the ones who will be "investigating"
him. So Vallon orders one of his men to plant

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:28.309
a bomb in the driver's side wheel well of
Murphy's car that afternoon while Murphy is

00:06:28.309 --> 00:06:32.870
visiting Lewis in the hospital.

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:38.360
Alex goes home to his wife Clara and 10-year-old
son David. After putting David to bed, he

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:43.289
and Clara start to have meat injection game
when the car alarm goes off. Worrying that

00:06:43.289 --> 00:06:48.599
it'll wake David, Alex goes to turn it off.
The car alarm is a trap, and it lures him

00:06:48.599 --> 00:06:54.129
outside, and the car is then blown up remotely.
Alex is critically wounded, subjected to fourth

00:06:54.129 --> 00:06:59.259
degree burns over his entire body, both his
legs and one arm have to be amputated, he

00:06:59.259 --> 00:07:04.380
is blind in one eye, and will probably be
deaf. Dr. Norton and his medical team, seeing

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:09.139
a perfect candidate for their project, convince
Clara to give consent to use Alex for the

00:07:09.139 --> 00:07:15.220
program, although she is concerned as to what
kind of life he will have.

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:20.800
Three Months Later. Alex is at a party with
Clara, along with Jack and his wife. Alex

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:26.069
and Clara dance to a Frank Sinatra song. This
turns out to be a memory that Norton and Kim

00:07:26.069 --> 00:07:30.889
are viewing as they put the finishing touches
on Alex's new mechanical suit. They wake him

00:07:30.889 --> 00:07:35.960
up, and he is in shock as to what he sees.
He grabs Norton by the throat and throws him

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:40.939
down. Kim tries to shut Alex down as he runs
out of the room, but Norton tells her to let

00:07:40.939 --> 00:07:45.399
him go. Alex continues to run until he hops
over the wall of the facility and through

00:07:45.399 --> 00:07:51.770
a field before they're able to shut him down
and bring him back in.

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:57.169
Back in the lab, Norton speaks with Alex face-to-face
and shows him just what is left of him - only

00:07:57.169 --> 00:08:02.939
his head, heart, lungs, and brain are still
intact. Alex is horrified by this and requests

00:08:02.939 --> 00:08:07.590
that he die. Norton reminds him that Clara
signed the consent forms, so if they let him

00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:12.129
die, the work will have been for nothing.
Alex later talks to Clara through a video

00:08:12.129 --> 00:08:17.520
chat. She is happy to hear from him again.
Afterwards, he later sees news reports on

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:21.939
his attempted murder, and is dismayed that
much to his suspicions, Vallon is still out

00:08:21.939 --> 00:08:26.309
there on the streets, Lake and Daniels having
scuttled the investigation into his attempted

00:08:26.309 --> 00:08:32.979
murder, while Jack offers messages of support
for his fallen partner.

00:08:32.979 --> 00:08:37.780
Alex is put through training and is set to
get familiar with his program. As Maddox shows

00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:43.500
him, his suit can respond to a threat, taking
out a firearm if needed. Alex is taken a simulator

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:49.620
room where he is placed next to a basic EM-208.
As shown on a monitor, the robot responds

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:54.410
to threats quicker than Alex, who hesitates
and is conscious of potentially harming civilians,

00:08:54.410 --> 00:09:02.190
yet also shows more sound tactics. Maddox
quips that he "wouldn't buy that for a dollar".

00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:07.130
After Alex's simulator training is complete,
he moves on to field training. He is put to

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:12.440
the test against Maddox in an exoskeleton
along with other robots. As Alex easily maneuvers

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:17.131
through the robots' gunfire, he shoots them
all and tases Maddox for good measure. The

00:09:17.131 --> 00:09:22.430
entire training is observed by Norton and
Sellars. Norton explains that although Alex

00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:27.589
thinks he is the one carrying out these actions,
he is merely carrying out orders as programmed.

00:09:27.589 --> 00:09:32.420
Kline points out that this is illegal, but
Sellars thinks it's fully legal for a machine

00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:35.430
to think it is a man.

00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:40.509
Norton drives Alex to his home where he will
get to see Clara and David for the first time.

00:09:40.509 --> 00:09:45.230
David set up a "welcome home banner" for his
father. Alex enters his home, and although

00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:50.740
both Clara and David are surprised by his
new appearance, they still embrace him.

00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:56.710
A public press conference is held to present
the new and reformed Murphy to the city. While

00:09:56.710 --> 00:10:00.980
he is getting set up, Norton and Kim see on
a monitor the emotions going through Murphy's

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:05.600
head as they put the police database information
into his head. When he starts to remember

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:11.230
his attempted murder, he becomes overwhelmed
and starts to have a seizure. Dr. Norton catches

00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:16.410
him and is pressed by Kline and Pope to find
a solution in a matter of minutes. He and

00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:21.529
Kim resolve to lower Murphy's emotional levels.
He walks out to find Clara and David waiting

00:10:21.529 --> 00:10:27.779
for him. David says hello to his dad, but
Murphy just continues walking with no expression.

00:10:27.779 --> 00:10:32.649
He passes Sellars and the mayor as they extend
their hands to him. Once he steps out before

00:10:32.649 --> 00:10:38.020
everybody, the crowd goes silent as he begins
scanning the crowd for criminals with warrants.

00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:43.319
Things escalate as he spots one man in the
crowd, Thomas King, who is wanted for murder.

00:10:43.319 --> 00:10:48.199
Murphy calls the man out to arrest him. King
begins to run until Murphy hops into the crowd

00:10:48.199 --> 00:10:54.550
and shoots him with a taser round to the back,
knocking him down.

00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:59.529
The incident is spun by Pat Novak on his show
as a reason for people to finally get behind

00:10:59.529 --> 00:11:04.170
this new program. He notes that King stood
within spitting distance of two cops who could

00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:09.459
not identify him and that he has eluded the
police for six years on charges of rape, assault,

00:11:09.459 --> 00:11:14.579
and murder, yet Alex was able to catch him
within a minute. As a result, public opinion

00:11:14.579 --> 00:11:19.959
on the Dreyfuss Act begins to change. The
citizens of Detroit begin to embrace Alex,

00:11:19.959 --> 00:11:23.910
giving him the nickname of RoboCop, though
some are against this due to the belief that

00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:29.770
the police work belongs to human cops and
not a robot. However, Sellars tells Dr. Norton

00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:33.850
to, for the meantime, keep Murphy away from
his family.

00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:39.649
At the police station, Murphy comes in as
Chief Dean briefs the other officers on several

00:11:39.649 --> 00:11:44.700
murder suspects. Murphy says he will take
on the case to look for a criminal named John

00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:49.649
Biggs. He patrols through the city on his
motorcycle. He catches a few totally stoned

00:11:49.649 --> 00:11:54.930
junkies, getting one to tell him where Biggs's
drug lab is. Murphy finds the lab and storms

00:11:54.930 --> 00:12:00.450
in, gunning down Biggs's goons. Biggs tries
to run but Murphy has him cornered. He tries

00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:04.720
to throw a grenade at Murphy, but he gets
shot in the leg and drops it, blowing himself

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:08.139
up in the process.

00:12:08.139 --> 00:12:13.290
Days later, Alex is stopped on the street
by Clara as he's leaving to fight more crime.

00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:17.389
She pleads for him to hear her as she tells
him that David is traumatized and is having

00:12:17.389 --> 00:12:22.420
nightmares. Although Alex seemingly ignores
her, moments later, he can't help but tap

00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:29.720
into CCTV footage to see reporters hounding
Clara and David as she tries to take him to

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:31.000
school.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.130
Realizing how much he's become distant from
his family, Murphy rides back to his home

00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:40.170
and inspects the crime scene where his car
blew up. He reviews the security footage that

00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:45.010
recorded the blast, and is further dismayed
to realize that David witnessed his burning

00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:53.120
body, leaving him fearful, anxious, and distressed.
He resolves to end Vallon once and for all.

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:57.899
To start, Murphy goes back to Jerry White,
the gun dealer who first told him and Lewis

00:12:57.899 --> 00:13:03.199
about Vallon being behind the gun trafficking.
He tracks Jerry down and pulls him out of

00:13:03.199 --> 00:13:08.440
his car to interrogate him. Jerry initially
resists and tries to avoid giving him answers,

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:13.000
until Murphy breaks his hand and gets him
to give up the identity of a man on Vallon's

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.951
crew that he's in contact with. Using his
access to the phone company records, Murphy

00:13:17.951 --> 00:13:22.850
is able to locate Vallon's warehouse. As he
rides over to the warehouse, someone tips

00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:28.250
off Vallon to Murphy's impending arrival.
Vallon rallies his men to grab their guns.

00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:32.649
As an extra precaution, they turn the lights
off and don night-vision goggles, hoping to

00:13:32.649 --> 00:13:37.779
make it harder for Murphy to get kill shots
on them. They open fire on Murphy as he blows

00:13:37.779 --> 00:13:42.870
down the doors with his motorcycle. In the
barrage, Murphy gets his suit shot and his

00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:48.410
visor broken, but he kills all of Vallon's
remaining gunmen, saving Vallon for last.

00:13:48.410 --> 00:13:52.689
After gunning down Vallon, Murphy picks up
a gun from one of the fallen soldiers and

00:13:52.689 --> 00:13:59.699
scans it for fingerprints, picking up prints
from Lake and Daniels.

00:13:59.699 --> 00:14:04.959
Murphy returns to the police station, followed
by Jack. He interrogates Lake and Daniels,

00:14:04.959 --> 00:14:08.529
showing the meeting through every monitor
in the station to prove their involvement

00:14:08.529 --> 00:14:14.100
in the bombing. Daniels tries to shoot Murphy
but gets shot in return. Lake admits that

00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:18.699
Dean was involved with both the shootout at
the restaurant and the car bomb. He tases

00:14:18.699 --> 00:14:24.410
Lake and goes to confront Dean. Before he
can get a confession out of her, Maddox, operating

00:14:24.410 --> 00:14:32.670
from the facility, shuts Murphy down. Maddox
reports this to Sellars who is in his helicopter.

00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:37.529
On another episode of "The Novak Element",
Novak comments on how Murphy exposed the corruption

00:14:37.529 --> 00:14:42.210
within the police department, further suggesting
why it's time to finally put the robots out

00:14:42.210 --> 00:14:47.350
on the street. Meanwhile, Sellars meets with
Maddox, Kline, and Pope to talk about the

00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:52.050
state of Murphy's condition. Kline issues
a statement to the public to say that Murphy

00:14:52.050 --> 00:14:56.879
is in critical condition. Sellars decides
that they can use Murphy as a symbol of martyrdom

00:14:56.879 --> 00:15:02.260
to stir up sympathy. Additionally, the Dreyfuss
Act is repealed. Clara demands to see her

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:06.439
husband but is denied.

00:15:06.439 --> 00:15:11.199
Sellars sends Maddox and other mercenaries
out to destroy Murphy, preparing to tell Clara

00:15:11.199 --> 00:15:16.480
that Alex died from his injuries. Kline arrives
at Clara's home and escorts her and David

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:21.839
to HQ to meet with Sellars. With Kim's help,
Dr. Norton runs into the facility where Murphy

00:15:21.839 --> 00:15:26.279
is being kept, warning him that the mercenaries
are sent by Sellars and are there to kill

00:15:26.279 --> 00:15:32.779
both of them. Murphy wakes up in time to kill
the two goons before they can fire at him

00:15:32.779 --> 00:15:34.600
and Norton.

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:39.410
Murphy rides his motorcycle to OmniCorp Headquarters
and gets help from Lewis, who has rallied

00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:44.600
the SWAT team to assist. He tases one guard
outside the building, forcing the others to

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:49.639
stand down. He flips his motorcycle into the
building, getting the attention of two ED-209

00:15:49.639 --> 00:15:55.160
droids. They shoot at Murphy, but he gets
them to shoot at each other. A third droid

00:15:55.160 --> 00:16:00.089
is caught in the chaos and falls from a great
height, and Alex's left arm is caught beneath

00:16:00.089 --> 00:16:08.470
it. As more droids come in, Murphy is forced
to grab a submachine gun and shoot his left

00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:13.689
arm off. The droids shoot at him, bringing
him down. Lewis runs in and stands in front

00:16:13.689 --> 00:16:19.910
of him, giving Alex a chance to run. He is
found by Maddox and another goon, both of

00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:24.720
whom are wearing red asset bracelets, which
keep Murphy from shooting either of them.

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:28.779
Before Maddox can deliver the fatal shot,
Lewis shoots him in the back and kills him,

00:16:28.779 --> 00:16:33.699
and then kills the other goon before getting
shot himself, nonfatally. Murphy assesses

00:16:33.699 --> 00:16:40.249
the wound and determines it to be non-fatal
to Lewis.

00:16:40.249 --> 00:16:44.779
Murphy makes it to the rooftop of the building
as Sellars is waiting for a helicopter. Clara

00:16:44.779 --> 00:16:49.721
and David are there with him, as are another
mercenary, along with Kline and Pope. Alex

00:16:49.721 --> 00:16:54.600
orders the latter two to stand down, and they
comply. He attempts to arrest Sellars for

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:59.019
trying to have him killed, but he is also
wearing a red asset bracelet, and therefore

00:16:59.019 --> 00:17:04.221
he cannot shoot him. Sellars aims his gun
at Alex, and then at Clara and David. This

00:17:04.221 --> 00:17:09.809
gives Alex enough of a push to override his
program and shoot Sellars, who returns fire.

00:17:09.809 --> 00:17:14.630
As Sellars dies, Clara and David rush to Alex's
side.

00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:21.010
A while later, Alex is given a new repaired
suit. Clara and David are there to visit him.

00:17:21.010 --> 00:17:25.260
He smiles as they come in.

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:29.990
The last scene shows one more segment of "The
Novak Element." The President has vetoed the

00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:35.990
repeal of the Dreyfuss Act once Norton testifies
against OmniCorp's program. Despite this,

00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:41.410
Novak is still pro-robot, continuing to praise
Sellars and bash Norton for being a whistleblower.

00:17:41.410 --> 00:17:47.630
As he concludes his show, Novak urges viewers
to stop whining and to get with the program.

00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:52.440
