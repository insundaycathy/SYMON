00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Hello everyone, this is Mr. Brain Junkie&nbsp;
here! and today we'll be talking about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.200
a fantasy action film called Snow Girl and the&nbsp;
Dark Crystal! Be ready for some spoilers ahead!

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.840
A long time ago, the earth was&nbsp;
separated into three realms,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.520
the heaven where the Gods resided,&nbsp;
The Earth where the humans lived&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.480
and the underworld where the&nbsp;
Demons are constantly suffering.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.920
The day for the reincarnation draws near, giving&nbsp;
Demons a chance to appear on the mortal realm.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.400
General Zhang from the celestial army&nbsp;
volunteers to guard after the city of Hu,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.960
where the infamous demon lord is located.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.400
At the same time, numerous monsters appear in&nbsp;
the city and begins attacking everyone on site,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.360
killings the people and taking&nbsp;
their souls to the underworld.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.520
The demons carry the souls that they stole&nbsp;
and lays them inside the dark crystal,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.440
where it's magic allows them to&nbsp;
reincarnate and leave this terrible place.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.760
However, a man named Kui steals the&nbsp;
crystal while others are not looking,

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.120
but his strange behaviors are&nbsp;
quickly noticed by a lizard demon,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.400
who takes away his cloak,&nbsp;
revealing that he's a thief.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.000
All the monsters quickly become&nbsp;
hostile and charges towards the man,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.920
forcing him to run for his life.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.680
A large demon chases closely after&nbsp;
and is able to strike the man,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.840
but he escapes just in time at the help&nbsp;
of General Zhang who pulls him away.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.600
The lizard demon transforms into a&nbsp;
woman and rushes to stop the thieves,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.000
but only manages to see them escape.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.240
The demon lord is furious at his minions&nbsp;
for losing something so valuable,

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.920
and quickly goes to one of his most&nbsp;
powerful lieutenants named snow,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.960
telling her to retrieve the&nbsp;
crystal no matter the cost.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.960
Back at the human realm, the deity&nbsp;
gives Kui some medicine to drink,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.360
claiming that it can heal his wounds faster.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.320
He tells the man that they must&nbsp;
prepare to fight the demons,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.480
as the monsters will attack soon after&nbsp;
losing their most valuable treasure.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:48.560
He gives Kui a magical fan and&nbsp;
sprays the man's blood over the item,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.400
causing a transformation that turns&nbsp;
the warrior into a giant demon.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:57.280
Kui looks in the mirror and sees the&nbsp;
reflection, causing him to fall down in fear.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.240
The deity warns him to never&nbsp;
transform in front of the people,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.560
as they'll surely become hostile after&nbsp;
looking at the man's monstrous appearance.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:10.320
Kui begins training under the god's instructions,&nbsp;
and soon begins to be able to transform at will.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.160
He takes out the enormous sword that's&nbsp;
imbedded inside his spine and begins&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.440
sparring with the master, but his movements are&nbsp;
still too slow and fails to land a single hit.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.960
The deity gives him one more elixir, promising&nbsp;
that the medicine will help him recover faster.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.560
Back at the city of Hu, the&nbsp;
people all bow before the deity,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.200
and watches the old man give the dark&nbsp;
crystal to his magical beast called Qilin.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.320
Zhang promises the people that&nbsp;
they are very close to winning&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.200
as they now have the dark&nbsp;
crystal in their possession.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.160
Seven days later on the&nbsp;
night of the reincarnation,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.280
the souls taken by the demons would be returned to&nbsp;
the people, and their loved ones will be revived.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.640
He warns everyone to be wary&nbsp;
of the demons as they'll surely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.520
attack the city in order to regain their treasure.

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.240
Sometimes later, many performers arrive&nbsp;
to the gates of city and wishes to enter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.480
in order to host their show for the people.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.000
The men are quickly mesmerized by&nbsp;
the girls' female assets while their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.840
wives are screaming in their ears.

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.760
Kui comes to inspect the carriages,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.200
and is to shock to see a beautiful&nbsp;
woman dressed in all whites.

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.680
The warrior seems to know the girl from his past,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.120
but she refutes the assertion&nbsp;
and tells him to call her snow.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.360
Before the woman leaves, Kui grabs onto&nbsp;
her hand and comments on how rare it is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.320
that she feels so cold, just like someone he knew.

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.520
The man's very lucky that he's&nbsp;
not in the 21th century, as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.160
his actions would have landed him in jail by now.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.120
It turns out that Kui knows the woman from&nbsp;
before as her painting hangs over his bedroom

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.440
Threes years ago while studying to become&nbsp;
a scholar, the man meets the woman at his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:44.240
front door and immediately fell in love,&nbsp;
prompting him to draw a portrait of the girl.

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:48.640
She comes back the next day to the man's&nbsp;
surprise, and when Kui takes the woman's hand,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.960
he comments on how she felt very cold.

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.360
The two quickly fall for each other as they waste&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.160
no time before commencing&nbsp;
some aggressive cuddling.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.440
The woman wants to know whether&nbsp;
if a human can love a demon,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:04.320
but the man doesn't think so, not knowing&nbsp;
that his lover is in fact from the underworld.

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.480
She leaves later that night in tears,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.240
after realizing that Kui can&nbsp;
never accept her for who she is.

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:14.000
Back to the present, the performers&nbsp;
begin their show as all the villagers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.400
gather inside the giant tent,&nbsp;
mesmerized by the beauty of the dancers.

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.720
However, the lizard demon notices&nbsp;
that everyone's here except for Kui&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.960
and informs her sister right away.

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.760
Snow leaves a letter in the&nbsp;
main character's front door,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.040
asking him to meet so that she&nbsp;
can distract him from her plans.

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:34.720
the man arrives at her room and quickly&nbsp;
becomes possessed by her beauty,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.760
as he misses her greatly in&nbsp;
the years that she was gone.

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:42.800
The two begins to embrace and prepares for&nbsp;
some adult actions, but Kui notices the icicles&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.360
behind his back, and quickly paralyzes&nbsp;
the woman by hitting her special spots.

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:51.920
He quickly rushes to the temple where the the&nbsp;
magical Qilin is guarding over the crystal,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:57.120
and takes the item away from the box, anticipating&nbsp;
that the demons will try to steal it tonight.

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.040
Just like the man predicted, a&nbsp;
giant demon arrives into the temple,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.800
and the Qilin begins attacking the&nbsp;
monster furiously in their battle.

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.280
Snow has transformed into a demon as well,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.320
and proceed to search for the&nbsp;
crystal inside the building.

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.600
She quickly finds Kui in his&nbsp;
demon form guarding the temple&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:17.040
and attacks the man from behind,&nbsp;
sending him through the rooms.

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:20.000
Snow attacks by throwing&nbsp;
multiple ice shards at Kui,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.520
forcing the man to dodge immediately&nbsp;
and barely escapes the onslaught.

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.440
The woman continues to shoot at the man&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.720
and eventually nails him on the&nbsp;
wall and freezes him in place,

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:32.960
as the lizard demon transforms into her&nbsp;
true form and arrives in front of the box,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.040
not knowing that it's empty already.

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:39.360
Kui is able to slowly melt himself out of&nbsp;
the ice and begins charging up tremendous&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:44.000
amounts of energy, before releasing it&nbsp;
in a shockwave, forcing snow to retreat.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.120
At the same time, the Qilin&nbsp;
shoots fire from it's mouth,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:51.200
forcing the giant demon to run and&nbsp;
eventually traps him under a stone pillar.

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:55.120
The magical beast rushes towards the&nbsp;
enemy and bites on the monster's neck,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.720
killing him in the process.

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:00.720
The lizard demon brings the box to her&nbsp;
master who's been waiting for her return,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:04.560
but when she opens the container,&nbsp;
only a piece of rock is inside.

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.160
Realizing that they've been tricked,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:10.160
the demon king becomes furious as&nbsp;
he transforms into his true form.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.960
Meanwhile, Kui hands the crystal to his master,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:16.560
who congratulates everyone that&nbsp;
they've won the battle once again.

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.520
He takes out the performers&nbsp;
and ties them onto a pillars,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:23.840
forcing them into their true forms which&nbsp;
turns out to be lesser demons of all kinds.

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:28.000
The people begin killing the monsters and&nbsp;
sending their souls towards the crystal.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.240
Snow becomes furious as she watches&nbsp;
from the crowds and begins transforming,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:35.120
trying to kill the deity to&nbsp;
avenge her friends deaths.

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:38.160
General Zhang is quickly able&nbsp;
to overpower her and forces&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:42.240
her back into the human form in front&nbsp;
of Kui, as the man watches in shock.

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:45.520
He orders his pupil to slay&nbsp;
the demon, but surprisingly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:50.480
the man refuses and kneels before the god,&nbsp;
begging him to spare his lover's life.

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:52.800
Seeing that his student is defending the enemy,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:57.360
the deity strikes at the demon himself, but&nbsp;
Kui jumps in the way to protect the girl.

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:00.080
Their attentions are quickly&nbsp;
shifted when the demon lord&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:04.320
himself arrives at the gates of the&nbsp;
city along side his army of monsters.

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:08.560
The soldiers begin to fire numerous arrows&nbsp;
at the enemies, but their numbers are too&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:13.280
great and the demons manage to easily enter&nbsp;
the city as they break down the front gates.

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:17.360
The Qilin rushes out from the temple and&nbsp;
tries attacking the demon lord, but the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:22.080
creature is quickly defeated by the monster as&nbsp;
it get tossed around and thrown to the walls.

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:27.120
The demons continue towards the town center,&nbsp;
only to be stopped by general Zhang and Kui.

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:30.800
The deity tries attacking the enemies&nbsp;
by shooting numerous projectiles,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:35.520
but it wasn't effective as the demons lord&nbsp;
transforms into it's true form once again.

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:38.400
Zhang sees this and quickly&nbsp;
stabs Kui in the chest,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:42.480
forcing the man to transform as well in&nbsp;
order to fight off the giant monster.

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:48.080
The demon lord chases Kui onto the rooftops as the&nbsp;
man runs desperately trying to evade the attacks.

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:51.840
The monster jumps towards the main character&nbsp;
and tackles him through the buildings,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:56.400
but Kui is able to bite off one of heads&nbsp;
on the demon and manages to break free.

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:59.680
The warrior runs towards the&nbsp;
lake and jumps inside the water,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:03.680
trying to gain the advantage as he lures&nbsp;
the demon into a different environment.

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:06.560
The monster takes the bait by&nbsp;
entering the water as well,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:10.640
which gives Kui the chance to attack him&nbsp;
from behind and knock him towards the walls.

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:13.440
The demon becomes furious and smashes the ground,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:17.760
causing a large shockwave that devours the&nbsp;
main character as he tries to run away.

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:21.680
Instead of killing Kui, the monster tries&nbsp;
to bring the man towards the surface,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:25.280
but the warrior wakes up and attacks&nbsp;
the demon by cutting off his arm.

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:28.800
He drags the monster onto the surface&nbsp;
and throws him towards the city,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:31.120
causing the demon to crash into the buildings.

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:34.560
The creature recovers quickly&nbsp;
from the fall and roars furiously&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:37.280
as Kui arrives inside the location as well,

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:42.080
but surprisingly, he allows the demon to leave&nbsp;
as repayment for not killing him earlier,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:44.240
and ignores the orders from his master.

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:48.560
The deity is very upset that Kui has&nbsp;
disobeyed him and sided with the enemy,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:51.360
ordering the man to kill&nbsp;
the snow demon right away.

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:56.640
The warrior arrives in the prison where the woman&nbsp;
is being tortured constantly by the demon seals.

00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:59.760
After hesitating briefly, the&nbsp;
man frees her by cutting off&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:03.040
the restraints and promises&nbsp;
to protect her from now on.

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:05.760
When they arrive at a house&nbsp;
to hide from the soldiers,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:10.160
Kui starts to lose control of himself as&nbsp;
the transformation begins to takes place.

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:14.160
The man laughs maniacally and attacks&nbsp;
the woman, pinning her to the ground,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:17.920
but he's quickly stopped by the lizard&nbsp;
demon at the order of the demon lord.

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:20.800
She gives him the same elixir as the deity did and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:24.640
explains that it's true purpose is&nbsp;
to calm the man's vengeful spirit.

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:30.160
Apparently, Kui has died a long time ago during&nbsp;
the final examination to becoming a scholar.

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:33.120
The headmaster was bribed by&nbsp;
the family of the students,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:36.400
and chose to fail Kui in order&nbsp;
to make room for the bribers.

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:42.000
The man was framed as a cheater and taken away&nbsp;
to executed, leaving his spirit to be restless.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.440
He drinks the medicine in order&nbsp;
to regains control to his body,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:49.600
and plans to go to the underworld in order&nbsp;
to find out the truth from the demon lord.

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:51.680
The two arrives in hell and sees numerous&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:54.960
demons surrounding them as the&nbsp;
demon lord finally appears.

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:59.680
The monster tells him that he's nothing more than&nbsp;
a vengeful spirit who's been resurrected by Zhang,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:02.080
in order to steal the dark&nbsp;
crystal from the demons.

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:02.284
He explains that the man was&nbsp;
turned into a demon by the deity,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:02.284 --> 00:10:02.520
as no one but demons can enter this realm.

00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:06.960
Kui refuses to accept this and attacks&nbsp;
furiously, but gets pushed back by the monster's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:11.840
immense aura that causes a large explosion,&nbsp;
eventually revealing the demon's human form.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.320
Apparently, Zhang told the demon king to&nbsp;
attack the city in order to acquire more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:27.280
spirts to help with the demons' reincarnation,&nbsp;
but this created tremendous fear in the people.

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:31.440
as a result, they accepted the&nbsp;
deity as a savior without question.

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:35.440
In truth, Zhang wants the dark crystal&nbsp;
for himself so that he may suck out the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:39.040
souls of all the demons and humans&nbsp;
on the night of the reincarnation,

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:41.680
giving him great power that exceeds any God's.

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:44.960
The demon lord believes that only&nbsp;
Kui can save the realms and restore&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:48.800
them to order as he was created&nbsp;
by using the deity's own power.

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:52.080
The demon extracts all his energy&nbsp;
and gives it to the warrior,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:55.120
so that he may save all the&nbsp;
demons from being destroyed.

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:59.440
The next day, Kui goes in the city and&nbsp;
tries to warn the people about their god,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:02.960
who's planning to use them as&nbsp;
sacrifices for his own ambition.

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:05.840
However, no one believes the words that he says,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:09.840
especially after he defended the&nbsp;
snow demon and helped her escape.

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:13.920
Suddenly, the deity arrives and&nbsp;
everyone bows in honor of their god,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:18.480
but Kui charges forward in anger and&nbsp;
continues to blame Zhang for the evil doings.

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:22.080
The deity uses magic and tries&nbsp;
to force the man to transform,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:26.480
while all the people begin throwing rocks at&nbsp;
Kui, believing that he's the true villain.

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:29.520
The people's animosity causes Kui to lose control&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:33.200
and transform into his demon form&nbsp;
that frightens everyone around him.

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:35.920
The soldiers begin shooting&nbsp;
arrows at the main character,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:38.800
causing great damage as he has no where to run.

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:42.880
Luckily, snow arrives in time and summons&nbsp;
an ice storm that blocks the view,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:45.200
while taking her lover away from danger.

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:48.800
Kui is furious for being called&nbsp;
the villain and scream in rage,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:51.360
causing a large explosion inside the lake.

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:55.200
He runs helplessly away from the&nbsp;
city, and refuses to face the truth,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:59.760
but snow chases him behind and eventually&nbsp;
calms down the man using her embrace.

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:03.840
She tells her lover to not feel ashamed&nbsp;
as he's done everything right, but Kui&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:08.160
doesn't believe that it matters as they'll&nbsp;
all be killed by the dark crystal very soon.

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:12.720
The two embraces closely as Kui finally&nbsp;
falls unconscious from the exertion.

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:16.960
When the man wakes up later that night,&nbsp;
he finds that Snow has left already,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:20.080
most likely to stop the deity&nbsp;
from destroying the people.

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:23.840
At the same time, Zhang unleashes&nbsp;
the dark crystal upon the city,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:27.600
and the souls of the people are&nbsp;
sucked away one by one into the sky.

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:30.560
However, his ritual is interrupted by Snow,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:33.920
who arrives to stop the evil&nbsp;
god from continuing the madness.

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:38.720
She mocks the deity for being a false god&nbsp;
and begins to attack him furiously using&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:42.800
her ice powers, but Zhang counter&nbsp;
quickly and wards off the elements.

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:45.840
Snow transforms into a demon&nbsp;
and charges towards Zhang,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:48.560
as the god tries to stop her using his magic.

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:52.400
The woman manages to throw the crystal&nbsp;
into the air, and rushes forward,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:54.880
trying to take the stone away from the deity.

00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:58.320
Zhang flies quickly into the sky&nbsp;
and traps her using his magic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:00.720
before Snow can grab onto the crystal.

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:04.000
He conjures lightning from the&nbsp;
sky and directs it at the demon,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.320
striking her with tremendous power and&nbsp;
causing her to be paralyzed in the air.

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:11.280
Kui smashes through the gates&nbsp;
and rushes into the building,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:13.920
only to see that a battle has already occurred.

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:18.320
He jumps on the rooftop and sees that Zhang&nbsp;
has trapped his lover in a sealing technique,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:20.800
which causes him to be consumed in rage.

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:23.760
Kui transforms violently and grabs onto the god,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:27.440
smashing him around like the hulk and&nbsp;
kicks him in the air like a ragdoll.

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:31.040
He charges towards the flying&nbsp;
deity and attacks him furiously,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:33.440
punching him through the buildings as a result.

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:36.800
Zhang recovers quickly and&nbsp;
strikes Kui with incredible speed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:39.360
not allowing the man to counter in any way,

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:43.680
but the main character soon locks onto the&nbsp;
god and charges in with a barrages of punches,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:45.920
forcing the enemy inside his shield.

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:50.000
Kui takes out his sword from the back&nbsp;
and strikes the god using immense force,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.320
cutting open the barrier and splitting&nbsp;
the old man in half using a second strike.

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:57.920
The deity explodes in the last&nbsp;
moment and finally perishes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:00.800
allowing snow to be released&nbsp;
from her prison as well.

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:04.000
The woman falls from the sky&nbsp;
as Kui rushes in to catch her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.640
but she's mortally wounded by the previous fight.

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:10.320
Snow tells the man that she'll&nbsp;
always love him and dies in his arms,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:14.320
while Kui screams in agony after&nbsp;
seeing his lover disappear forever.

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:19.520
The souls all begin to return to the people as&nbsp;
they finally realize who their true savior is,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:23.120
but Kui walks away emotionlessly&nbsp;
no matter how much he's praised.

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:27.760
He returns the crystal to its rightful place&nbsp;
and restores balance between the realms.

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:32.640
The king of all deities offers him a place&nbsp;
in heaven, but Kui refuses in silence,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:35.920
realizing that Gods are nothing&nbsp;
more than hypocrite in the end.

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:39.360
He jumps into the underworld and&nbsp;
transforms into his true form,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:41.840
finally embracing his identity as a demon.

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:46.720
