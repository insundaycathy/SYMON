00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:02.130
Hi, Mystery Recapped here.

00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:06.950
Today, I'm going to explain an American dystopian
film called “The Darkest Minds.”

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:08.470
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:10.000
Watch out and take care!

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.890
In the year 2043 in the United States, Children
and teenagers start to die because of a terrible

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.320
disease that only afflicts children.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.230
This disease is contagious and spreads very
quickly.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.890
However, this disease is only lethal to children
but not to adults.

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:35.760
As a result of this virus, 98% of children
and teens die, and only 2% of children survive

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.310
the disease, and the children who survive
become abnormal.

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:43.539
The disease triggers a special ability in
these children which makes them dangerous.

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:47.390
The government urges all parents to hand over
their surviving child to a camp for healing

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:48.699
and research.

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:53.699
And at that time, the President of America
- President Gray - claims that his son, Clancy,

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.559
has survived the disease and is currently
being treated at the camp for healing, and

00:00:57.559 --> 00:00:59.480
his condition is getting better.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.390
In the camp, doctors and scientists classify
children and their disorders into five colours:

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.570
First, it is the Greens; for children whose
intelligence has increased.

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.070
The second is blue; for those who have telekinetic
abilities.

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.890
The third group is Gold, who have the power
to manipulate electricity.

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.540
The first three groups are considered to be
quite safe, and are only being treated in

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:20.920
healing camps.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.810
The fourth group is the group that is considered
dangerous, which is the red colour for those

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.220
who can control fire, and the fifth group
is Orange, the most dangerous group, for those

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.770
who can manipulate the minds of other people.

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.090
The red and Orange groups are very rare, and
the government considers them very dangerous

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.990
and orders them to be killed immediately on
sight.

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.970
The film takes us to a setting where a little
girl named Ruby is celebrating her birthday

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:44.390
with her parents.

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.930
They are worried because all the children
around are dead, and only Ruby is still alive.

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.480
At night, Ruby comes to her mother’s room
to calm her down, but suddenly she has a strange

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.830
vision when she holds her mother’s hand.

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.060
In the morning, her mother does not recognize
Ruby as her child anymore, and her mother

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.350
calls the government to take Ruby away to
the healing camp.

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.420
Finally, Ruby is taken with the other children
to the healing camp.

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.680
Every child brought to the camp, gets examined
by the Doctor to determine what abnormality

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:12.909
they have.

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:16.790
Ruby is taken to the examination where she
is identified as being ‘orange’ , the

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.969
most dangerous group that can control other
people’s minds.

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:24.349
Therefore, the doctor immediately wants to
inject Ruby with lethal injection.

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:28.390
But Ruby is able to control his mind and convince
him that she is ‘green’, the ones whose

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.079
intelligence has improved rapidly and is not
considered dangerous.

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:37.989
On the camp, there are three groups; Green,
Blue, and Gold, but there are no red nor orange,

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:40.689
because they are all killed immediately on
sight.

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:43.620
Ruby then lives her life in the camp as a
green.

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.230
Six years have passed, Ruby, who is working
in the camp, is scolded by the camp captain

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:49.780
for making a mistake.

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.189
The captain feels that Ruby is more stupid
than the other people there, and grows suspicious.

00:02:54.189 --> 00:02:59.439
However, Ruby’s campmate tries to defend
Ruby and insults the camp captain which infuriates

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:03.079
him, and as a result, the captain takes her
away for punishment.

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:06.140
The children are treated really badly in the
camp.

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.359
Later at the camp, frequency tests are often
held.

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:14.019
In short, this frequency test is a test that
uses a very loud sound whose frequency can

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:16.010
only be heard by the children.

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.269
During this frequency test, Ruby faints, and
she is taken to a doctor called Doctor Cate

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:22.189
for further examination.

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:26.279
From the examination, the officer finds out
that Ruby is an orange.

00:03:26.279 --> 00:03:29.810
Doctor Cate secretly writes a note to Ruby
that they have found out Ruby is an orange

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.799
and will kill her immediately.

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:34.409
And Doctor Cate tells Ruby to meet her in
the boiler room.

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:39.219
In a panic, Ruby then directly goes to the
boiler room, and in there, Doctor Cate is

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:40.569
waiting for her.

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:44.810
By that time, the alarm has been sounded for
an intrusion, and all officers are ordered

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.409
to look for Ruby.

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:50.670
With Doctor Cate’s help, Ruby manages to
leave using Doctor Cate’s car.

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:55.669
But at the checkpoint, Ruby is almost caught,
but Ruby uses her power to control the officer’s

00:03:55.669 --> 00:03:57.069
mind to let them escape.

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:01.569
Finally, after six years, Ruby manages to
get out of the camp.

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:05.590
In the car, Cate gives Ruby a panic button
that can be activated as a tracker if she

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.040
is in danger.

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.829
Cate explains that she is part of the Children’s
League, whose mission is to save children

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:12.969
from the camp and fight the government.

00:04:12.969 --> 00:04:17.380
Cate takes her to a gas station to meet her
boyfriend, Rob, who is also on a child rescue mission.

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.630
But when Ruby almost falls and holds Rob’s
hand, she has a vision of Rob, who seems to

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:24.420
like abusing children.

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:26.920
Ruby becomes suspicious of their motives.

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:31.718
When Ruby changes her clothes at a shop, she
suddenly sees a small girl who can manipulate electricity

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.410
The girl runs away when she sees Ruby, and
Ruby chases after her.

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:40.570
The girl then gets into a van, and Ruby follows
her to hide from Doctor Cate.

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:45.260
The little girl is called Zu, and she is a
mute and always wears gloves due to her ability.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.730
Zu is accompanied by two friends called Liam
and Charles.

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:53.450
Liam is a blue with telekinesis ability, while
the intelligent Charles is a green.

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:56.430
They agree to go with Ruby and help her escape
from Cate.

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:00.820
On the way, there is a woman who tries to
chase them; Her name is Lady Jane.

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:03.840
Lady Jane is a child hunter who works for
money.

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.540
While in pursuit, Cate also tries to pursue
them.

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:11.230
However, Liam uses his telekinesis power to
harass them by scattering the leaves, cracking

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:14.080
the road, and even knocking down the trees.

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.590
As a result, they manage to escape.

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:20.340
They also begin to get to know each other
better, but Ruby does not reveal her identity

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.860
as Orange and lies that she is a Green.

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.470
Liam explains that they are on their way down
the East River to a group of children led

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:29.390
by a mysterious person nicknamed the Slip
Kid.

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:32.680
They don’t know the identity of the Slip
kid, but it looks like he’s an Orange who

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.720
can control people’s minds.

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:39.460
He also explains that the Children’s League
led by Dr. Cate is not a good place to stay.

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:43.070
He used to be in the Children’s League,
where they train children to use their abilities

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:44.920
to fight against the government.

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:49.390
Liam didn’t like the idea of becoming a
soldier, and so he eventually left the League.

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:54.596
Meanwhile, Ruby and the others spend the night
at an inn. Ruby remembers the time with her parents.

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:58.880
It is revealed that she couldn’t really
control her ability, and because of that,

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:02.560
she accidentally erased her parent’s memories
of her when she was a kid.

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:07.040
While sleeping, Ruby accidentally touches
Zu’s hand and then gets a memory that Zu

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:10.450
where she used to be in a government camp,
but eventually, she and hundreds of other

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:14.380
children rebelled and fled, and the rebellion
was led by Liam.

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:17.900
Because of the trauma during her life at the
camp, Zu became mute.

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:22.300
In the morning, they go to a long-abandoned
mall to shop and pick up some supplies.

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:26.520
They really enjoy their moment together, since
they never have a normal childhood.

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:30.240
But suddenly, their bodies are lifted and
controlled by a group of people.

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:33.750
Luckily, Zu uses her electric power to stop
it.

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:37.780
It turns out that they are also a group of
children who have telekinesis abilities.

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:42.050
At night, they talk about the children’s
association in the East River and its very

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:43.460
secret nature.

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:47.520
They know where East River is, but they can’t
tell Ruby and her friends the exact location

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:49.690
because it’s a secret they cannot tell.

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:53.920
However, Ruby uses her telepathy secretly
to make one of them unconsciously gives a

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:57.220
clue about the location, which is the letter
E-D-O.

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:01.923
Later that night, the genius Charles tries
to figure out what E-D-O is, but he finds nothing

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:07.110
However, after speaking with Ruby about her
father being a cop, Charles starts to realize

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:09.860
that E-D-O might be a radio frequency.

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:14.930
He concludes that E represents 5, D represents
four, and O represents 0.

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:18.210
And he uses the number 5-4-0 for the radio
frequency.

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:23.571
Finally, they receive a message from the frequency,
and finds that the location is at Lake Prince Virginia.

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:29.510
The next day, on the road, they are ambushed
by Lady Jane, the child hunter, and she uses

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:33.230
the sound frequency of her rifle to incapacitate
the children.

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:37.710
Luckily Ruby uses her power to control Lady
Jane’s mind, and gives Jane a deserving punishment.

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:42.300
Liam and the others are shocked that all this
time Ruby is Orange.

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:46.465
It turns out that Ruby has lied to them all
this time because she isn’t proud of her abilities

00:07:47.298 --> 00:07:50.308
Some time later, Ruby confides with Liam about
her past.

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:53.330
And they start to fall in love with each other.

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:57.240
Finally, they continue their journey and arrive
at Lake Prince Virginia.

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:59.610
There, they meet other children like themselves.

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:04.460
They are so amazed because they haven’t
seen that many children in a very long time.

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:08.280
They also meet the Slip Kid, and it turns
out that all this time, he is the son of the

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:10.330
President, Clancy Gray.

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:12.960
Clancy is an orange, just like Ruby

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:13.960
At night, they have a party.

00:08:14.671 --> 00:08:16.861
Liam and Ruby dance together romantically.

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:22.320
In the morning, they are all given an assignment,
and Ruby is assigned to help Clancy.

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:26.530
Clancy tells Ruby that he is one of the first
people to survive the terrible disease, and

00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:29.610
the government used him to experiment to create
a cure.

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:31.200
But the Doctor failed.

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:35.279
And his father, the President, lied to the
public that they had found the cure.

00:08:35.279 --> 00:08:39.837
Clancy eventually escaped and formed a children’s
association where all the children can live safely.

00:08:40.810 --> 00:08:44.980
Clancy then teaches Ruby how to control her
power and control other people’s minds without

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:48.050
touching their hands, and Ruby finally succeeds.

00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:51.720
In return, Ruby teaches him how to erase people’s
memories.

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:56.200
However, during this process, Clancy controls
her mind and tries to kiss her.

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:59.149
Ruby is distraught, and she hits him and leaves.

00:08:59.149 --> 00:09:02.189
Ruby and her friends finally decide to leave
the place.

00:09:02.189 --> 00:09:05.639
But while on the run, they are ambushed by
troops from the camp.

00:09:05.639 --> 00:09:09.310
Liam tries to fight back, but suddenly he
becomes unconscious.

00:09:09.310 --> 00:09:12.160
It turns out that Clancy has made him unconscious.

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:16.620
It is revealed that all this time, Clancy
has been the mastermind behind it all.

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:20.290
Clancy has contacted the Camp captain to arrest
all the children.

00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:24.600
Clancy has been manipulating his father, the
President, and taking control of the government

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:25.970
using his power.

00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:29.860
His main goal is to create his army of children
with superpowers so that he would never get

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:31.590
abused by anyone.

00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:36.329
Ruby then uses her power to make the camp
captain commit suicide, and Zu controls the

00:09:36.329 --> 00:09:38.899
electricity to create a trick to escape.

00:09:38.899 --> 00:09:42.600
Suddenly armed forces arrive with helicopters
to arrest all the children.

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:46.579
The troops brought the children in the red
group who can control fire; it turns out that

00:09:46.579 --> 00:09:50.670
they are secretly weaponized by the government;
and they set the camp on fire.

00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:52.569
The battle finally ensues.

00:09:52.569 --> 00:09:57.430
The red army tries to burn Liam and his friends,
but Liam uses his power to retaliate.

00:09:57.430 --> 00:10:00.949
But suddenly, Clancy comes in the middle of
the battle and manipulates the minds of all

00:10:00.949 --> 00:10:02.360
the children there.

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:06.309
Liam and the others are forced to leave the
location and leave Ruby there, because only

00:10:06.309 --> 00:10:08.819
Ruby has the power to face Clancy.

00:10:08.819 --> 00:10:11.480
Ruby uses her ability to create her army.

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:15.740
However, Clancy shows his brutal nature, and
controls their mind to kill themselves by

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:16.970
shooting each other.

00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:21.620
Clancy then tries to use his new memory-erasing
powers to turn Ruby to his side, and forget

00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:22.889
her friends.

00:10:22.889 --> 00:10:28.160
But Ruby uses her power to control the pilot’s
mind, and the helicopter crashes and explodes.

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:32.499
Ruby manages to escape the explosion with
the help of Charles, but unfortunately, Charles

00:10:32.499 --> 00:10:37.190
gets burnt, and he is severely injured, leaving
Ruby no choice but to use her panic button

00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:39.649
to call the Children’s League for help.

00:10:39.649 --> 00:10:42.910
The next morning, the League squad comes to
pick them all up.

00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:47.403
Charles is immediately taken to the hospital
for treatment, while Zu is adopted by a good family

00:10:48.189 --> 00:10:52.009
But Liam is arrested by the League because
he has betrayed the League before.

00:10:52.009 --> 00:10:56.029
The League considers Liam knows too much about
the League to be left free.

00:10:56.029 --> 00:11:00.270
Ruby meets Kate and bargains to release Liam
by promising to be a soldier in the League,

00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:02.779
and fight against the government alongside
them.

00:11:02.779 --> 00:11:06.567
However, Kate is sure that Liam will never
leave without Ruby, and he won’t let Ruby

00:11:06.567 --> 00:11:07.596
join the League.

00:11:07.889 --> 00:11:10.290
Finally, Ruby meets Liam.

00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:13.959
Liam explains that he wants the two of them
to stay together and discuss plans for both

00:11:13.959 --> 00:11:15.529
of them in the future.

00:11:15.529 --> 00:11:19.879
But Ruby is forced to erase herself from Liam’s
memory, so that Liam can be released and so

00:11:19.879 --> 00:11:22.680
that she can join and fight with the Children’s
League.

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:26.720
All memories of Ruby from their first meeting
in the Van, chatting together and dancing

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:29.569
together, are all gone from his memory.

00:11:29.569 --> 00:11:33.189
Suddenly Liam doesn’t remember anything
about Ruby, and Liam leaves.

00:11:33.189 --> 00:11:35.800
Ruby then cries as she sees Liam leave.

00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:39.759
At the end of the story, Ruby joins and trains
with the Children’s League.

00:11:39.759 --> 00:11:41.089
But there is more!

00:11:41.089 --> 00:11:45.040
The struggle of Ruby and her friends is far
from over ,because it turns out that Clancy

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:46.560
is still alive.

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:50.050
And a fierce battle between the two sides
will be inevitable.

00:11:50.050 --> 00:11:54.019
