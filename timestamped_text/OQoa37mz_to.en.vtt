00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.880
Story Recapped here. Today, I'm going to&nbsp;
explain a horror and thriller film called&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.960
"I Spit On Your Grave." Spoilers&nbsp;
ahead! Watch out and take care.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.200
Jennifer Hills, a novelist from New York&nbsp;
City, travels to Louisiana to write her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:20.560
second novel. Along the way, she stops at a shop&nbsp;
to get the keys to the cabin she'll stay at.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.760
At the shop, a man named Earl hands her the&nbsp;
keys before instructing her how to get there.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.840
According to Jennifer, the purpose of her&nbsp;
trip is for some peace while she writes.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.280
On the way there, Jennifer gets confused about&nbsp;
the roads, so she pulls up at a gas station for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.960
some help. There, she meets Johnny, one of&nbsp;
the attendants, who points which direction&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.360
she should go. Johnny attempts to make a&nbsp;
move on Jennifer, but she scares him after&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.760
accidentally pressing her panic button. He spills&nbsp;
a bucket of fluid, causing Andy and Stanley,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:58.080
his friends, to laugh at him. As Jennifer&nbsp;
drives off, Johnny's embarrassment is evident.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.720
After the long stretch of road, Jennifer finally&nbsp;
arrives at the cabin, which will be her home for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.600
the months to come. She immediately unpacks&nbsp;
her belongings, ready to embark on a change of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.720
environment. The following day, Jennifer relaxes&nbsp;
by the lake after days of working on her novel.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.560
She hears suspicious noises but does not pay&nbsp;
much mind to them. However, the noises reoccur&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.600
and make her uneasy. Jennifer walks across the&nbsp;
nearby shed to check, but she finds nothing but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.720
bottles of poison inside. She accidentally spills&nbsp;
her drink onto her clothes and goes to the kitchen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.680
to wash off the stain. In there, an unknown&nbsp;
person is secretly documenting her half-naked.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.400
The following day, she jogs through the&nbsp;
woods and stumbles upon an abandoned cabin.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.040
Out of curiosity, Jennifer enters&nbsp;
to check how it looks like inside.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.960
However, she does not find anything&nbsp;
interesting and continues to go about her day.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.560
Back home, she discovers that her sink and&nbsp;
toilet are clogged, urging her to call a plumber,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:59.200
Matthew. He suffers from a mental disability,&nbsp;
hence his stuttering way of talking. After he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.440
fixes the problem in her bathroom, Jennifer&nbsp;
gets giddy and gives Matthew an abrupt kiss.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.080
For a moment, the shy Matthew blushes&nbsp;
and runs outside because of it.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.720
In the woods, Andy, Stanley, and&nbsp;
Johnny hang out and kill birds for fun.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.840
The brutality is recorded by Stanley, who has&nbsp;
a passion for documenting anything random. Not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:23.200
long after, Matthew arrives and tells the group&nbsp;
how he received a kiss from Jennifer. Johnny does&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.920
not believe him, but Stanley confirms that it is&nbsp;
real before showing a video of her in underwear.

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.880
At nightfall, Jennifer still hears the creepy&nbsp;
noises around the house and becomes more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.840
bothered by them. She sees a lifeless bird&nbsp;
just outside her door, but other than that,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.400
she finds nothing. Upon returning inside, she&nbsp;
sees her laptop with the group photo of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.200
guys she met days before. She looks at it in&nbsp;
horror before realizing that they are inside.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.040
Johnny, Stanley, and Andy taunt Jennifer&nbsp;
altogether, causing fear to the poor lady.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.600
Stanley calls Matthew, and Johnny drags him inside&nbsp;
so he could also participate in their scheme.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.640
As the leader, Johnny initiates the group&nbsp;
into threatening and letting Jennifer drink.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:08.000
When she refuses, Johnny becomes more agitated,&nbsp;
leaving her no choice but to abide by his orders.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.760
He then asks Jennifer to show him&nbsp;
her teeth and pulls her closer.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.760
Johnny pulls out a gun and forces it on&nbsp;
Jennifer's mouth in a sensual manner.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.400
Andy approaches her and does the same thing, but&nbsp;
with liquor, while Johnny forces Matthew to watch.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.120
Jennifer finds the courage to hit Andy's&nbsp;
knee before pepper-spraying Stanley.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.680
It allows her to escape into&nbsp;
the woods and run to safety.

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.760
Jennifer bumps into Storch, the local&nbsp;
sheriff, along with Earl. In tears,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.360
Jennifer informs the two men of the&nbsp;
assault that she has experienced recently.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.720
Storch calms her down by showing his badge,&nbsp;
informing her that she is now in safe hands.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.560
The sheriff tells Earl to go home as he&nbsp;
will accompany Jennifer back to the cabin.

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.120
Moments later, Storch drives with Jennifer&nbsp;
back to the cabin to confront the group.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.000
He bravely calls them out while looking for&nbsp;
them inside the cabin. Upon examining the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.840
scene, Storch finds the broken bottle of&nbsp;
alcohol and a joint belonging to Jennifer.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.560
He begins to interrogate Jennifer despite&nbsp;
her pleas for help as if she is not a victim.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.200
According to him, she has no right to make&nbsp;
false accusations about the men he knew since&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:14.560
they were kids. Storch then orders Jennifer to&nbsp;
face the window as he pats her down. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.960
he touches her improperly, revealing that Storch&nbsp;
is the group's accomplice as the boys enter.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.280
While Storch points a shotgun at her,&nbsp;
he orders Jennifer to get on her knees.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.480
Johnny picks her up while ordering Matthew to&nbsp;
remove his pants. At the moment, Jennifer is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:34.240
helpless, to say the least, with five heartless&nbsp;
men; her chance of survival is at stake. Stanley&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.720
records the whole thing while Matthew begins to&nbsp;
force himself on Jennifer until he is satisfied.

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:43.440
Despite being weak, Jennifer manages to&nbsp;
gather her strength and get out of the cabin.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.800
Further into the woods, she stumbles upon the&nbsp;
group again, where more sufferings await her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.760
Andy drags Jennifer near a puddle and submerges&nbsp;
her head a couple of times. As she lays on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:59.200
the ground, Storch removes his pants to force&nbsp;
himself on her, ignoring her cries for mercy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.440
After the men take turns on Jennifer, she&nbsp;
gains consciousness and is now covered in dirt.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.840
Jennifer gets up once again to go further&nbsp;
into the woods in the hope of some real help.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:11.520
Still unhinged from the hell she has&nbsp;
been through, she reaches the bridge&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:16.000
while the five men continuously follow her.&nbsp;
Just when Storch is about to shoot her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.880
Jennifer lets herself fall into&nbsp;
the river, leaving no trace.

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:24.800
The group searches for her, but they have no luck&nbsp;
tracking her body anywhere. As an alternative,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:30.240
they destroy evidence left behind, especially&nbsp;
Stanley's recordings. After the eventful day,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:37.040
Storch returns home, where his wife and daughter,&nbsp;
Chastity, welcomes him. As if nothing happened,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:42.320
he spends the night at home without any remorse&nbsp;
for his actions. The next day, Storch stops by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:46.640
Earl's shop to return the keys to the cabin,&nbsp;
saying that Jennifer left without notice.

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:51.760
Weeks pass, and the group goes on with their&nbsp;
lives as if nothing happened. Apart from the rest,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:55.520
Matthew is the only one that feels remorse&nbsp;
and spends most of his time in the woods.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.520
One day, he gets a vision of Jennifer&nbsp;
staring at him in a ghostly way.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:04.080
Matthew covers his eyes out of fear and gets&nbsp;
under the idea that Jennifer is haunting him.

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:09.360
While Andy and Johnny are hanging out for some&nbsp;
drinks, they see Stanley running toward them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.640
With worry in his voice, he informs&nbsp;
the voice that his camera has been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.280
stolen before revealing that&nbsp;
he kept the controversial tape.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:19.840
Johnny gets in a fit of rage and starts&nbsp;
beating Stanley up for putting them at risk.

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:24.400
That night, Johnny hears noises outside&nbsp;
his home and checks outside to find a dead&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:29.680
bird on the porch. He kicks it off before&nbsp;
returning inside. When he goes back inside,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:34.400
he hears it again and comes out with a gun.&nbsp;
To his surprise, the dead bird is lying on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:39.680
his porch once again, the culprit unknown.&nbsp;
When Johnny hears it again, he rushes outside&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:43.520
to see Jennifer's slipper on the porch and&nbsp;
tries to chase the sound but to no avail.

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:49.120
Meanwhile, Storch comes home to his wife, who&nbsp;
informs him that a package has been delivered.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:53.600
To his horror, he finds one of Stanley's tapes and&nbsp;
is relieved that neither his wife nor daughter has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:58.000
seen it. Storch quickly drives off to meet&nbsp;
with the group, who are nervous to see him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:03.600
Immediately, Storch threatens Stanley, thinking&nbsp;
that he is playing a prank on him. To defend his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:08.160
friend, Johnny shows the slipper, suspecting&nbsp;
that Matthew is responsible for everything.

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:13.040
On their hunting trip, Storch hands&nbsp;
Earl a bottle of whiskey and shoots him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:16.080
The reason behind it is Earl is&nbsp;
one of the loose ends to the crime,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:18.960
as he saw Storch accompanying&nbsp;
Jennifer back to the cabin.

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:24.000
Still troubled by his visions, Matthew returns&nbsp;
to the cabin to reflect on his actions. Out of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.600
nowhere, he hears Jennifer's voice calling out to&nbsp;
him, so he comes inside. He ends up falling down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:34.720
the stairs and knocks himself out. As he gains&nbsp;
consciousness, he sees Jennifer in the flesh,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:39.680
sitting on the couch. Jennifer invites him to&nbsp;
sit beside her, and he repeatedly apologizes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:44.720
for what he did to her. Matthew clings to her&nbsp;
while sobbing as guilt overtakes him. Jennifer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:49.920
comforts and calms him down but later puts a noose&nbsp;
tight around his neck. Matthew continuously says&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:54.480
sorry despite gasping for air, but Jennifer&nbsp;
replies that an apology is not good enough.

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:59.120
The resurfacing of pieces of evidence prompts&nbsp;
the group to look for Matthew in the woods.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:04.480
After several minutes of searching for him,&nbsp;
Andy and Stanley end up in an abandoned cabin.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:08.320
Andy enters while Stanley remains outside&nbsp;
to search for any signs of Matthew.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:12.480
There, he shockingly sees Jennifer&nbsp;
standing across him, giving out a smirk.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:17.760
When Stanley advances on her, he steps on a&nbsp;
bear trap that she set up and calls for Andy,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:22.400
who gets hit with a bat. Both of them lose&nbsp;
consciousness after Jennifer also hits Stanley.

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:27.200
After some time, Jennifer ties Stanley to&nbsp;
a tree and records him with his camera.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:31.920
She brings out a dead rodent and shoves&nbsp;
it in his mouth, which makes him vomit.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:35.920
Jennifer then sets up the camera before&nbsp;
using fish hooks to keep his eyes wide open.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:40.000
While recording him, Jennifer guts a&nbsp;
fish and spreads its insides all over&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.560
Stanley's face. The scent of the fish guts&nbsp;
attracts numerous crows that begin to peck him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:48.880
After some time, his eyeballs are eaten&nbsp;
by the birds, and he bleeds to death.

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:54.320
Meanwhile, Andy wakes up inside the run-down&nbsp;
cabin, tied on a few boards over a bathtub.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:58.800
The water in the tub keeps rising just&nbsp;
as Jennifer enters to check on him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:03.440
Andy begs her to let him go, but she is sure about&nbsp;
inflicting the same torture that she went through.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:08.560
Jennifer repeatedly submerges his head into the&nbsp;
water before throwing in some lye and removing one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:13.920
of the planks. Andy is left with no choice but to&nbsp;
hold himself up with all his strength to stay up,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:17.200
but his body eventually falls&nbsp;
into the water. Because of this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:20.160
Andy's face is eventually&nbsp;
burned, causing death upon him.

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:24.720
The following day, Jennifer stops by the&nbsp;
local gas station where Johnny works.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:29.120
She seduces him by wearing a short skirt&nbsp;
and attacks him the moment he comes close.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:34.640
As part of her plan, she brings him back to the&nbsp;
cabin to release her wrath upon him. When Johnny&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:39.680
gains consciousness, he finds himself tied to the&nbsp;
ceiling without any clothing. His torment begins&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:45.280
when Jennifer pulls out his teeth one by one using&nbsp;
pliers, making him realize his mistakes. Jennifer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:50.640
brings out a gun and forces it on Johnny's mouth,&nbsp;
just like what he did to her. However, he manages&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:55.680
to laugh, which makes Jennifer more agitated.&nbsp;
Using hedge clippers, she cuts Johnny's private&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:55.680 --> 00:10:00.480
part before shoving it in his mouth. He screams&nbsp;
in terror before eventually bleeding to death.

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:05.840
Finally, Jennifer is down to her last&nbsp;
target: Storch. The sheriff receives&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:09.600
a call from his family, receiving news&nbsp;
that Chastity's teacher is at their home.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:15.040
On the phone, Jennifer greets Storch, leaving&nbsp;
him in a state of disbelief. Out of concern for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:19.600
his family, he quickly drives back home, only&nbsp;
to find out that Chastity came with Jennifer.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:24.640
Storch arrives at an empty playground with his&nbsp;
daughter still out of sight. Worries start to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:28.800
overtake him, and he runs back to the cop&nbsp;
car, where Jennifer knocks him unconscious.

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:35.440
Upon waking up, he finds himself inside the cabin&nbsp;
with a rifle shoved inside him. Showing no mercy,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:39.360
Jennifer talks about how nice Chastity is&nbsp;
and how he could stomach assaulting a woman.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:43.200
She shoves the rifle deeper, causing&nbsp;
unimaginable pain to the sheriff.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:47.360
Across the room, Jennifer reveals&nbsp;
that Matthew is alive but unconscious.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:52.240
A string attached to the trigger is tied around&nbsp;
Matthew's wrist, which will kill both men if he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:57.760
moves. At this point, Storch desperately begs for&nbsp;
his life, but Jennifer completely ignores him. 
 &nbsp;

00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:03.440
Unbothered by his cries, Jennifer walks out of&nbsp;
the cabin, patiently waiting for the situation to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:09.600
take its turn. Matthew eventually wakes up, urging&nbsp;
Storch to calm him down. However, Matthew's mental&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:15.120
incapacity causes him to panic and unknowingly&nbsp;
pull the trigger, ending their lives. Outside,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:19.520
Jennifer realizes that she has gotten her&nbsp;
revenge, and she celebrates with a faint smile.

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:24.720
After experiencing the worst kind of torture any&nbsp;
woman could imagine, Jennifer refused to let the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:29.600
men win. She took matters into her own hands and&nbsp;
inflicted the pain she thought the men deserved.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:34.560
Throughout the story, every man received&nbsp;
similar torture to what they did on Jennifer.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:36.880
In the end, Jennifer turned her pain into power.
