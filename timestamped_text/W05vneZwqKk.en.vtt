00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:01.609
Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.609 --> 00:00:06.720
Today, I'm going to explain an adventure,
horror, and thriller film called "The Descent."

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:07.720
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.730
Watch out and take care.

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:13.540
A group of thrill-seeking friends enjoys whitewater
rafting together.

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:21.780
A young girl, Jessica, cheers for her mother,
Sarah, once their raft reaches the bank.

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:26.230
Sarah's husband, Paul, helps her friend, Juno,
out of the water.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:31.170
Meanwhile, their other friend, Beth, advises
the family to head back without them while

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.650
she and Juno fix up the raft.

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.489
Driving back to their hotel, Sarah makes plans
for Jessica's birthday party.

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:42.530
Paul is distracted while driving, and as soon
as he looks away, their car crashes onto another

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.990
vehicle carrying metal pipes.

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:49.430
In the hospital, Sarah dreams about Jessica
blowing candles on a birthday cake.

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.780
She wakes up in a panic, looking for her daughter
in the hospital.

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.649
The lights start going out as a scared Sarah
runs down the hall until she crashes onto

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:58.140
Beth.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.230
Sarah collapses onto Beth's arms, learning
that her daughter and husband are dead.

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.830
Juno watches them with tears in her eyes,
grieving for her friend’s family.

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.250
One year later, Beth drives Sarah to the Appalachian
Mountains in North Carolina.

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.790
They reach the cabin where Juno meets them.

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:22.369
Their other friends, sisters Becca and Sam,
and Juno's protege, Holly, welcome them in

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:23.520
the cabin.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.600
Juno shows the group an old photo of her,
Beth, and Sarah.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.570
Feeling nostalgic, Sarah tells them to love
each day.

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.799
A phrase which her husband, Paul, used to
say.

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:36.760
At night, Holly and Sam share a smoke.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.700
Holly rants about caving systems for tourists
and how she wants a real adventure.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.330
Juno catches them talking and promises Holly
that she won't disappoint them this time.

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.060
The women spend the rest of the night drinking
and joking around.

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.759
Later that night, Sarah struggles to sleep.

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:56.330
She looks out the window, and a metal pipe
crashes inside, hitting her on the head.

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.619
She wakes up, startled from her nightmare
and still not over her grief.

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:04.490
In the morning, Juno wakes up the group after
her jog in the woods.

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.860
The rest are still hungover from last night,
but they get ready for their adventure.

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.319
Before leaving, they take a group photo in
front of the cabin.

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:16.489
When they arrive at their destination, the
group unloads their equipment and gear up.

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:20.569
Juno takes her book of the cave's map and
intentionally leaves it in the car.

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:23.870
Juno leads the way, having checked the route
the week before.

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.090
On the way, they find crows feasting on a
deer carcass.

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.980
They ignore the gruesome sight and continue
their trek.

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:35.010
They finally reach the location, looking down
a large cave entrance leading underground.

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.810
The group descends the cave.

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.719
They stop to enjoy the wondrous sight.

00:02:38.719 --> 00:02:41.669
While exploring, Sarah finds a bloody handprint
on the wall.

00:02:41.669 --> 00:02:45.349
A group of bats flies out of the cave, startling
them.

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:48.090
Juno leads them down a small tunnel system.

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.449
They reach a large opening where Juno scatters
flares, lighting up the place.

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:56.650
Sarah starts exploring on her own again but
senses that something is watching them.

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.739
She looks around and finds another small passage
but sees nothing else.

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:02.599
The women enjoy a lunch break.

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:07.459
Juno sees Sarah distracted and checks up on
her, but Sarah waves her worry away.

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:11.719
Juno tearfully apologizes for not staying
with her after the incident but assures her

00:03:11.719 --> 00:03:14.090
that they're all here for Sarah now.

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.419
Sarah accepts the apology, then decides to
explore on her own again.

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:22.309
Sarah finds the next passage, which looks
more cramped than the first.

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:25.779
Holly volunteers to go first while the others
wait for her to confirm there's an exit at

00:03:25.779 --> 00:03:27.010
the end.

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.980
Holly struggles to crawl inside but pushes
on until she reaches the end.

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.150
The rest follow, with Sarah going in last.

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.239
The other women make it through, leaving only
Sarah and Beth in the passage.

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:40.819
Sarah starts to panic due to the tight space.

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:44.400
Beth checks on her, but Sarah is stuck and
hyperventilating.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.290
Beth crawls back towards her, using a joke
to get her to calm down.

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.180
Sarah is finally able to move, but the passage
starts collapsing.

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.889
Sarah and Beth hurry out of the passage, leaving
Sarah's rope bag behind.

00:03:55.889 --> 00:04:00.319
Knocked out, Sarah dreams about Jessica with
a birthday cake again.

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:03.180
She wakes up with all her friends coughing
from the dust.

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.949
With their passage blocked, the others worry.

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:10.159
Becca remembers the guidebook claiming three
exits out of the cave, asking Juno to double-check

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:11.159
the book.

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:15.049
Juno confesses that she left the book in the
car, angering Becca.

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:19.150
Beth assures them that they'll be rescued
since they filed their trip to Mountain Rescue.

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.229
But Becca suspects that Juno led them to a
different cave than what they declared.

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:28.199
Juno justifies that they wanted a real adventure,
so she led them to an unexplored cave system

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:29.879
and wanted them to discover it.

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:33.190
Pissed, Juno tells them they have to move
forward.

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.229
They find another passage, but it ends in
a cliff.

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:39.550
Becca climbs over and rigs a line for the
others to cross.

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:44.039
She spots an old climbing anchor already placed
in and attaches her rope to it.

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:47.650
Becca finally reaches the other side and helps
her friends across.

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:52.199
Before crossing, Sarah asks Juno if what she
did was for Sarah or herself.

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:55.729
Juno claims that she wanted all of them to
get their friendship back by claiming this

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:57.259
new cave system.

00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:01.610
With the rest on the other side, Juno starts
undoing the rope and clamps, being the only

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:04.430
ones they have left after Sarah lost her rope
bag.

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:08.729
But Juno falls and the rope zips between Becca's
hand, causing a gash.

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:12.080
The rope stops Juno's fall, letting her climb
up.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.889
They check the old anchor from the rock.

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:18.580
Juno tells them that it's an obsolete model,
so it must have been left there for years.

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:22.479
Beth wonders if someone else got out of the
cave, but Juno disagrees.

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:27.039
If someone already discovered and exited the
cave, they would've named it already.

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:30.229
Continuing their journey, they see cave paintings
on the wall.

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:33.730
Seeing a drawing of the mountain and cave
gives them hope that there is another exit.

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:36.949
They move on, not noticing a creature nearby.

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:38.770
The group reaches a dead-end.

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:41.889
Juno turns on her lighter, searching for a
passage.

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:45.020
The light flickers in one hole, confirming
an open route there.

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:47.849
Holly hurriedly goes in, eager to leave the
cave.

00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:50.440
She spots a lighted area, thinking it's daylight.

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:52.259
But she slips into a hole.

00:05:52.259 --> 00:05:55.130
Juno grabs her hand, but she slips.

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:57.139
Holly breaks her leg as she falls.

00:05:57.139 --> 00:05:59.449
The women carry Holly out of the water.

00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:03.949
While Sam treats Holly's injury, Sarah hears
giggling in the darkness and follows it.

00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:06.490
Further inside, she finds an old helmet.

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:09.099
Nearby, she spots a movement.

00:06:09.099 --> 00:06:12.310
Sarah investigates, seeing a humanoid creature
drinking water.

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:14.919
Juno finds her, but the creature is gone.

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:17.539
Juno thinks Sarah is hallucinating.

00:06:17.539 --> 00:06:21.680
Heading back to the group, Juno and Sarah
argue about what she saw.

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:25.520
Sarah describes that she saw a man, thinking
that he might help get them out.

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.599
But the others don't believe her.

00:06:27.599 --> 00:06:29.849
The women continue to look for a way out.

00:06:29.849 --> 00:06:33.830
They climb over a wall, reaching a chamber
filled with animal bones.

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:36.940
Sarah uses Holly's camera's infrared to view
the area.

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:41.660
Juno uses her lighter to find the right way,
but there's no breeze to give her a clue.

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:43.699
Sam starts screaming for help.

00:06:43.699 --> 00:06:46.020
Sarah then turns to Beth and sees the creature
behind her.

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:48.379
The creature lunges at them, screeching.

00:06:48.379 --> 00:06:51.580
They watch it crawl on the walls before disappearing
into the darkness.

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:54.780
Desperate, they try to choose any path to
escape the monster.

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:58.749
They hear the crawler circling them, making
them back away in fear.

00:06:58.749 --> 00:07:00.990
Sarah points to a tunnel, and they run to
it.

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:04.779
A crawler blocks Juno and Holly, causing Juno
to collapse.

00:07:04.779 --> 00:07:08.229
Holly tries to run, but the crawler grabs
her and bites her neck.

00:07:08.229 --> 00:07:11.840
The crawler then hops away, allowing Juno
to check on Holly.

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:15.289
The crawler returns and pushes her back, trying
to drag Holly’s body away.

00:07:15.289 --> 00:07:18.740
Out of panic, the other four women ran from
the scene.

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:20.830
Sam and Becca escape to a tunnel.

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:24.319
Beth follows Sarah on the opposite tunnel,
tripping along the way.

00:07:24.319 --> 00:07:28.529
As Sarah continues forward, she falls into
a pit and hits her head.

00:07:28.529 --> 00:07:33.229
Back at the chamber, Juno fights the crawler
off, refusing to let it take Holly.

00:07:33.229 --> 00:07:36.389
She gets her ice ax and swings it across its
face.

00:07:36.389 --> 00:07:40.650
Another crawler tackles Juno from behind,
allowing the first one to take Holly.

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:45.080
The creature tries to bite Juno, but she's
able to stab it with her ax.

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:49.360
Already deranged, Juno senses something behind
her and swings her ax, only to hit Beth on

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:50.439
the neck.

00:07:50.439 --> 00:07:53.029
Beth collapses, ripping Juno's necklace off.

00:07:53.029 --> 00:07:58.259
Juno watches Beth struggle with her injuries,
but she slowly steps away in guilt and fear.

00:07:58.259 --> 00:08:01.289
In the tunnel, Sam and Becca worry about the
others.

00:08:01.289 --> 00:08:04.740
They press on, not noticing the crawler nearby.

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:06.599
Sarah wakes up alone in the pit.

00:08:06.599 --> 00:08:11.270
She picks up Holly's camera to see in the
dark, finding human and animal bones everywhere.

00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:14.330
Hearing a screech, she hides behind some rocks.

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:17.620
Still using Holly's camera, she waits for
something to come.

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:20.309
She stifles a scream as Holly's body is dropped
in.

00:08:20.309 --> 00:08:23.520
More crawlers appear and start feeding on
the body.

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:27.000
Sam and Becca continue down their path but
hear screeches from afar.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.229
They search for another way, climbing up the
rocks to hide.

00:08:30.229 --> 00:08:32.310
Becca holds her sister protectively.

00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:35.919
Meanwhile, Sarah is disgusted at the scene
before her.

00:08:35.919 --> 00:08:38.419
She gags, catching a crawler's attention.

00:08:38.419 --> 00:08:42.099
It approaches but gets distracted when Juno
calls out for Sarah.

00:08:42.099 --> 00:08:45.310
The crawlers leave, following Juno’s voice.

00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:49.550
On the other side, Sam and Becca keep quiet
as a creature crawls over them.

00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:52.269
The crawler is unable to see them and moves
on.

00:08:52.269 --> 00:08:55.580
But Sam's watch starts alarming, catching
its attention again.

00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:58.090
Sam throws the watch away, misleading the
creature.

00:08:58.090 --> 00:09:00.690
The crawler investigates the watch but is
confused.

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:04.800
Juno's voice reaches them, prompting the crawler
to hunt her down instead.

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:08.110
Finally, alone, Sarah goes to Holly's body.

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:12.440
She notices the ice ax used as a splint for
Holly's broken leg and takes it.

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:16.700
She continues to take valuable items from
Holly, grieving for her friend.

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:21.560
Sarah finds a lamp nearby and pours its remaining
gas on torn pieces of Holly's clothes.

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:25.510
She lights a torch on fire, allowing her to
see the area better.

00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:27.769
Sam and Becca continue down the path.

00:09:27.769 --> 00:09:30.550
They're separated when a crawler jumps on
Becca.

00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:33.500
Becca tells Sam to run while she fights off
the creature.

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:37.390
The crawler nearly bites Becca on the neck
during the struggle, but Juno throws her ax

00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:38.850
at it, saving them.

00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:43.079
Sam reunites with them as Juno reveals that
Holly was taken and Beth's gone, not mentioning

00:09:43.079 --> 00:09:45.540
that she accidentally stabbed the latter.

00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:47.019
Sam studies the crawler.

00:09:47.019 --> 00:09:50.340
She suggests that the creatures are blind
and uses sound to hunt.

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:54.850
Juno figures that the creatures go above ground
to hunt for animals and bring it back down,

00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:56.740
so there should be another exit.

00:09:56.740 --> 00:10:00.460
Juno mentions the markings she saw from the
previous explorers that will lead them to

00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:03.699
the exit but insist that they shouldn’t
leave without Sarah.

00:10:03.699 --> 00:10:06.680
Back in the pit, Sarah finds Beth among the
mess.

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:09.690
Sarah tries to move her but stops when Beth
screams in pain.

00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:12.350
She tells Beth that she'll find Juno to help
her.

00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:15.120
But Beth reveals that Juno left her to bleed
out.

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:19.660
She warns her not to trust Juno, but Sarah
is more concerned about getting Beth out.

00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:24.160
Sarah tries to lift her again but slips, leaving
Juno's necklace in Sarah's hand.

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:28.680
Recognizing that it's Juno's, Sarah realizes
that Beth is telling the truth.

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:31.019
Beth tells her that the necklace was from
Paul.

00:10:31.019 --> 00:10:34.910
Sarah refuses to believe it but sees the words
"Love Each Day" on the pendant, confirming

00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:37.050
that it was from her husband.

00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:39.500
Screeches alert them that the creatures are
back.

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:41.430
Sarah tries to get Beth up again.

00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:44.630
Instead, Beth begs her to end her suffering.

00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:48.250
Sarah is distraught, but seeing Beth's pain,
she agrees.

00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:50.490
Sarah lifts a rock and drops it on Beth's
head.

00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:53.750
Sarah is frozen, trying to process what she
did.

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:56.590
A young crawler grabs her from behind.

00:10:56.590 --> 00:10:58.890
She throws it off her and steps hard on it.

00:10:58.890 --> 00:11:02.310
Nearby, she sees what seems to be the young
crawler's mother.

00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:05.850
It screeches, angered to find its child's
condition.

00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:09.320
Sarah runs away but falls into a pool filled
with blood and bones.

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:12.730
The female crawler jumps on her, but she fights
it off.

00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:16.430
Sarah grabs a broken tusk and drives it into
the crawler's head.

00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:20.230
Sarah climbs to reach her torch, but another
crawler appears nearby.

00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:23.449
The crawler climbs over the rock, touching
Sarah's head.

00:11:23.449 --> 00:11:25.670
But she stays still until it leaves.

00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:29.070
She grabs a bone and ambushes the crawler
from behind.

00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:33.820
Brimming with fear and anger, Sarah lets out
a wail that alerts Juno and the rest.

00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:37.570
Thinking that she's coming, Juno whispers
her name, ready to fight crawlers that may

00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:38.899
be chasing Sarah.

00:11:38.899 --> 00:11:43.480
But Becca and Sam argue that it's too late
to save her, urging Juno to run with them.

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:46.699
Before following Becca and Sam, Juno hears
movement.

00:11:46.699 --> 00:11:48.490
She checks, hoping it's Sarah.

00:11:48.490 --> 00:11:52.480
Instead, it’s a group of crawlers that comes
after them.

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:55.779
Sam frantically searches for a way out but
stops at a cliff.

00:11:55.779 --> 00:11:59.830
She tries to climb her way across, installing
a rope to hold her in place.

00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:03.730
Juno and Becca find her just as a crawler
scratches on her neck.

00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:08.750
Sam stabs the crawler on the chest, causing
it to fall before it lays limp and lifeless.

00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:11.130
Becca cries for her sister’s demise.

00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:14.949
Another crawler pulls her from behind and
takes a bite of her on the stomach.

00:12:14.949 --> 00:12:18.569
Unable to save her, Juno jumps off the cliff
and lands on the pool below.

00:12:18.569 --> 00:12:22.580
In the water, she sees the crawler that Sam
stabbed, still alive.

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:27.160
It tries to lunge at her, but Juno digs the
knife on its chest deeper, causing it to bleed

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:28.160
out.

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:31.279
Juno resurfaces and climbs up the wall to
the other side.

00:12:31.279 --> 00:12:34.360
She nearly falls, but Sarah grabs her and
pulls her to safety.

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:38.040
Shocked at Sarah's bloodied state, Juno freezes.

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:42.029
Sarah looks at Sam's body hanging above before
asking Juno about Becca and Beth.

00:12:42.029 --> 00:12:45.630
Juno confirms that they’re gone, claiming
that she saw Beth die.

00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:49.520
Knowing the truth, Sarah is angered but tells
Juno to press on.

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:52.940
Together, they search through the passages
for an exit.

00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:56.319
Three crawlers block their way, and the women
prepare for battle.

00:12:56.319 --> 00:12:59.230
A crawler jumps on Juno, biting her.

00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:02.199
Another one steals Sarah's torch and drags
her by the leg.

00:13:02.199 --> 00:13:04.350
Sarah stabs it on the leg before tackling
it.

00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:07.730
The third crawler jumps on her back, but she
throws it off.

00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:10.870
Sarah bites the second crawler's ear before
crushing its skull.

00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:13.100
Juno rams the other one's head on the wall.

00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:16.319
The third crawler goes for Juno, and she hits
it with her ax.

00:13:16.319 --> 00:13:20.500
Now alone, Sarah stares down at Juno, her
ax in hand.

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:26.079
She reveals Juno's necklace in her hand, letting
Juno realize that Sarah knows about the affair.

00:13:26.079 --> 00:13:29.079
Crawlers screech from afar, distracting Juno.

00:13:29.079 --> 00:13:32.730
Sarah takes the opportunity and swings her
ax on Juno's leg.

00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:36.220
Sarah escapes while Juno is left to fend for
herself.

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:40.250
Sarah hears Juno's screams from afar, causing
her to fall and hit her head.

00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:43.020
She wakes up, feeling the sunlight on her
face.

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:47.870
She crawls over a mound of animal bones, finally
able to escape the cave.

00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:50.839
Sarah emerges in the woods, taking in a deep
breath.

00:13:50.839 --> 00:13:54.070
She screams in fright, running until she finds
her car.

00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:57.829
Sarah finds the spare keys and drives through
the dirt path recklessly until she reaches

00:13:57.829 --> 00:13:59.560
the road.

00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:02.010
Finally safe, Sarah parks the car.

00:14:02.010 --> 00:14:05.699
She cries, mourning her friends and shaken
by the terror she went through.

00:14:05.699 --> 00:14:08.240
A truck passes by, jolting her upright.

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:12.779
She vomits out the window, then looks to the
passenger seat to see Juno's ghost next to

00:14:12.779 --> 00:14:13.779
her.

00:14:13.779 --> 00:14:16.339
Still in the cave, Sarah wakes up from the
dream.

00:14:16.339 --> 00:14:19.180
In front of her is Jessica with a birthday
cake.

00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:31.180
Sarah lovingly stares at the vision of her
daughter as the crawlers come closer.
