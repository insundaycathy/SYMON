00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:02.139
Welcome to Movie Shortens.

00:00:02.139 --> 00:00:05.770
Follow us today to a movie titled: Elevator.

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:08.450
Be aware, there are spoilers!

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:13.139
In the opening scene, we see a rather somber
looking man making a device using a soldering

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.200
iron.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.430
He soberly explains to someone that this could
prove fatal to anyone within a five meter

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:19.430
radius.

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:23.160
We then cut to a view of New York where we
see Mohammad looking at what looks to be a

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.070
homemade greetings card.

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.360
Panning across the city, George is getting
dressed while repeatedly reciting a joke.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:34.800
Meanwhile, Maureen and Don share a kiss over
a cup of coffee in their expansive apartment.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.760
A pregnant Celine clutches her prominent belly
lovingly in her bathroom.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:45.130
Next we pan to Jane, in a nervous state sitting
in what appears to be a small, dingy bedroom,

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:47.309
sipping liquor from a hip flask.

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.030
At the same time, a suit-clad Martin steps
into a yellow cab.

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.980
Finally, we are introduced to Henry, a well-dressed
businessman, and his granddaughter Madeline,

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.860
who asks him if the night is going to be boring.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.390
Arriving at the foot of a skyscraper, these
characters make their way towards an elevator.

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.520
First comes the tall, handsome but rather
impolite Don and his fiancé Maureen.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.400
The security guard at the elevator asks them
for ID and soon recognizes Maureen as a TV

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.400
reporter.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.490
Clearly, he’s a fan.

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.720
They are joined by one of Don’s colleagues
named Martin, who appears nervous.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.960
He is expecting the boss of the company, who
they’ve never met, to be at the event later

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.210
that evening.

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.360
The forth arrival is George, the event’s
comedian, who declares that he is borderline

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.120
claustrophobic and so he pleads with the security
guard not to overload the lift.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.270
He seems quite agitated and uncomfortable.

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:38.630
A security guard inside the lift makes a joke
about Mohammed, suggesting he is a terrorist.

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.540
Jane, who is walking with a stick, is helped
into the elevator by a guard and is soon followed

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.430
by Henry Barton and his young companion.

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:50.480
He is asked for ID, at which point Madeline
suggests the guard not be such an idiot.

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.740
As he looks for the ID, Don interjects telling
the security guard to check the name on the

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.240
front of the building.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.480
Henry is, it seems, is the BIG BOSS.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:03.940
Just as the doors are closing, a final member
of the party, Celine, arrives.

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.340
Despite George’s protests, she is allowed
to board.

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.670
As the lift begins to ascend, George is clearly
uneasy shifting his weight back and forth.

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.620
His eyes are fixated on the floor numbers
above.

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.319
Martin tries to reassure him, telling him
that this elevator has never broken down.

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:23.200
George says that would be his worst nightmare.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.499
Madeline, intrigued asks her grandfather why
George is so concerned.

00:02:27.499 --> 00:02:32.409
The mischievous young lady then notices the
stop button and slides back its protective

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:33.650
cover.

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.040
Looking directly at George, she pushes it.

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.930
The elevator comes to a halt.

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.810
George reacts angrily and aggressively but
she claims that it was only an accident.

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.379
George knows that it wasn’t but the others
don’t realize it.

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:50.140
With Mohammed’s advice, Henry attempts to
get the elevator moving again by pressing

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.590
a series of buttons.

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.640
However, we then learn that the brakes are
stuck.

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.569
Concerned at the lack of movement, Henry requests
help via the intercom but the assistant shows

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:00.879
no interest.

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:04.290
There seems to be no help in site.

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.160
George then begins to drink from his flask
to calm his nerves.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.420
He argues with Madeline and Henry saying he
has been fired from his gig as a comedian

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:13.859
for the night’s event.

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:17.379
The conversation soon turns to the purpose
of Henry’s visit.

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:21.489
Martin asks Henry if he is about to retire
and he admits that he is.

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:26.249
During this conversation, Jane interjects
suggesting that Henry can because he is due

00:03:26.249 --> 00:03:29.169
to receive a 75 million dollar payout.

00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:33.140
She then asks George for a sip of his drink
using it to swallow some pills.

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.659
The conversation turns to her and we then
find out that her husband has passed.

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:40.639
She is a few minutes from collapsing to the
ground.

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:45.219
Don then becomes centre stage calling out
Mohammed for not being able to help.

00:03:45.219 --> 00:03:50.579
Celine makes conversation with Don, clearly
interested to learn that he and Maureen are

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:51.579
engaged.

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:55.859
Having been instructed to tell a joke by Jane,
the rather alpha Don finishes it for him and

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:57.480
tells it’s an old one.

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:03.379
George then argues with Madeline, Martin and
Mohammed, who we find out is from Iran. and

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:05.200
George is Jewish.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:10.120
In the next scene, Celine is desperate to
use the toilet - as a result of her pregnancy.

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.889
She uses her bag as a makeshift toilet as
others turn away.

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:17.060
Martin assists in sheltering her using his
jacket.

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.549
George, however, sneaks a peak then makes
an inappropriate remark.

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:26.180
With the attention now back on Jane, we learn
she has lost her son in Iraq.

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:30.090
Despite this, she and her husband had retirement
plans to buy a boat.

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:35.090
However, he lost a lot of money buying bonds
which rapidly lost value on account of advice

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:39.370
from Henry’s company and ended up killing
himself as a result.

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:45.440
Jane, now upset, tells Henry how he trusted
her and how unfair the situation is.

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.449
Henry reacts without emotion, telling her
life isn’t fair.

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:52.979
He asks her why she came.

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:56.560
Moving back in time, we learn that Jane was
the person in communication with the bomb

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:57.639
maker.

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:02.699
We see her collecting the device, telling
him she wants to use it to send a message.

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:05.840
We can now assume that this is why she came.

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.889
In the elevator Jane begins struggling for
air.

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:11.050
It seems like she’s having a heart attack.

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.319
Martin attempts to call for help.

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:16.639
While on the phone, Jane tells Celine that
she has a bomb.

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:21.539
Martin relays this information to the emergency
services at the other end of the call.

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:25.919
Jane has passed away, confirmed by the medic,
Mohammed.

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:30.280
This information is also transmitted to Maureen’s
news channel by phone.

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:34.330
Maureen then begins filming and streaming
the events using the phone.

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:39.050
As she does so the others argue about who
should check if there is indeed a bomb.

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:41.599
Celine eventually volunteers.

00:05:41.599 --> 00:05:46.039
First she checks Jane’s bag but there is
nothing, and they all breathe a sigh of relief

00:05:46.039 --> 00:05:47.510
at this knowledge.

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:51.699
They do, however, find a news clipping which
contains information about the suicide of

00:05:51.699 --> 00:05:52.699
her husband.

00:05:52.699 --> 00:05:55.220
Next, she checks Jane’s body.

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:59.939
As she runs her hands around Jane’s midriff
she announces that she’s found something.

00:05:59.939 --> 00:06:05.419
She opens the bottom of Jane’s blouse nervously,
revealing a small metal box fastened to her

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:07.050
with metal cables.

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:09.780
The group falls silent at this revelation.

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:12.879
They immediately begin contemplating their
escape.

00:06:12.879 --> 00:06:17.500
First Don forces a panel in the ceiling loose
looking for an escape hatch.

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:20.110
Looking through the gap he only finds lights.

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:23.229
Celine begins to smoke but Don stops her.

00:06:23.229 --> 00:06:26.319
She reacts by asking him if wants to be a
good father.

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:30.780
Maureen, of course, overhears this and begins
interrogating Don.

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:35.349
We learn that he and Celine work together
and that the two of them have had an affair.

00:06:35.349 --> 00:06:40.199
As tensions rise, George and Mohammed begin
to argue, with Mohammed grabbing George by

00:06:40.199 --> 00:06:41.909
the scruff of the neck.

00:06:41.909 --> 00:06:46.020
The others then step in to separate them.

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:48.780
On the outside the situation has made the
news.

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:51.289
The bomb maker sees this on TV.

00:06:51.289 --> 00:06:55.430
He hears about the people, including the young
girl, trapped in the elevator.

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:57.509
He appears highly concerned.

00:06:57.509 --> 00:07:02.439
In the next attempt to escape, led by Don,
the group tries to force the doors open.

00:07:02.439 --> 00:07:04.000
They realize they are trapped.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.900
Don, thinks that he might be able to reach
the buttons on the outside.

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:10.780
He attempts to do so using Jane’s cane.

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:15.520
At the same time Madeline begins rapidly pressing
buttons on the elevator’s panel.

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:21.051
Don eventually reaches the external buttons
as the elevator plummets down the shaft.

00:07:21.051 --> 00:07:25.620
Don’s arm is torn off as he was unable to
pull it back inside in time.

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:28.639
The elevator comes to a rest in complete darkness.

00:07:28.639 --> 00:07:33.979
In addition to Don’s injury, Henry has sustained
a laceration across his forehead, and Mohammed

00:07:33.979 --> 00:07:37.620
leg has been injured due to Martin falling
on it.

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:42.400
As the lights come on, Mohammed assists Don,
using his tie as a tourniquet to stop the

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:44.150
bleeding from the severed limb.

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:49.159
The mood starts to shift as George begins
helping Henry to take a seat and Madeline

00:07:49.159 --> 00:07:52.110
begins to accept some of the responsibility.

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:56.639
Elsewhere in the city, the bomb maker has
contacted a TV station and is being interviewed

00:07:56.639 --> 00:07:58.539
while seated on his bed.

00:07:58.539 --> 00:08:02.900
The interview is seen by the group via mobile
phone, which Martin is holding.

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:07.030
During the interview he explains that Jane
is a good person and that she wanted nothing

00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:09.030
to do with the situation.

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:11.960
He helped her because he’d been friends
with her son.

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:16.620
He admits that an explosion will be deadly
and that an explosion is only about ten minutes

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:17.620
from happening.

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:22.030
The major turn of events comes when George
decides they should try opening the doors

00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:23.030
again.

00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:26.300
The elevator has moved, so perhaps they’ll
be able to escape.

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:30.120
They finally manage to pull them apart, with
help from Henry.

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:34.120
There isn’t enough space to escape and so
they allow the doors to close.

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:38.139
Unwilling to give up, George asks for help
opening them once more.

00:08:38.139 --> 00:08:42.409
He says there might be a big enough gap allowing
them to throw the bomb down the shaft, keeping

00:08:42.409 --> 00:08:44.050
them from danger.

00:08:44.050 --> 00:08:45.610
There is one problem.

00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:48.070
The bomb remains chained to Jane.

00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:52.690
He asks if anyone has anything sharp, but
the only person able to respond is Mohammed

00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:54.180
who hands him a tiny knife.

00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:57.510
It will be impossible to cut through the metal
cable.

00:08:57.510 --> 00:08:59.750
But that is not his plan.

00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:03.380
Perhaps they can release the bomb by cutting
Jane’s flesh instead.

00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:06.850
While Mohammed remains resistant, others agree
with the plan.

00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:10.820
He’s unable to go through with it and instead
begs the others to help.

00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:16.420
The only one willing to help is Henry, who,
it turns out, has experience butchering animals.

00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:19.279
He begins by cutting into the skin near the
waist.

00:09:19.279 --> 00:09:24.430
He soon makes it to her guts, but needs assistance
to remove her organs, so Martin and George

00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:27.920
get on their knees helping in the bloody operation.

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:31.150
Unable to cut through the spine, they decide
to try to snap it.

00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:34.720
The group will divide forces and twist the
body from either end.

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:39.050
During this debacle, George asks Henry to
give everyone a million dollars if they are

00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:41.930
able to survive, Henry agrees.

00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:46.830
Before they can complete this, the help they
had been so desperately hoping for arrives.

00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:50.830
The doors are forced open from the outside
and the elevator is raised enough to open

00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:53.649
up a gap big enough to climb through.

00:09:53.649 --> 00:09:57.209
Madeline is the first out, with Martin at
the rear.

00:09:57.209 --> 00:10:02.339
When it comes his turn, he realizes he is
too big and that the explosion is imminent.

00:10:02.339 --> 00:10:06.740
The now, humane George pleads with those around
him to help.

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:10.940
Unperturbed, the support team tells him they’ll
lower the lift to another floor.

00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:15.800
The doors close and Martin finds himself alone,
with the remains of Jane and the impending

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:16.800
bomb.

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:21.060
Though distraught, he gathers himself muttering
“I guess I’m the hero”.

00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:25.740
Seconds later, as the elevator descends, the
bomb explodes.

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:30.300
Now outside the evacuated building, we see
George and Mohammed sitting down looking rather

00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:33.360
forlorn and understandably shellshocked.

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:38.370
As Henry walks by George reminds him about
the deal they’d struck in the lift, but

00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:39.790
isn’t acknowledged.

00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:41.730
Suddenly George’s phone rings and an irritated
voice is on the other end.

00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:46.149
It is his partner reminding him that he needs
to buy some toilet paper on the way home.

00:10:46.149 --> 00:10:50.200
She is clearly oblivious to the events that
have just unfolded.

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:55.430
