00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:07.924
hey what's up guys

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:11.188
today I'll show you a crime thriller film: "Captivity" 

00:00:11.476 --> 00:00:14.212
spoiler ahead, watch out and take care

00:00:14.548 --> 00:00:17.284
in a bustling city, there is an unknown assailant 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.020
who enjoys abducting and torturing other people

00:00:20.212 --> 00:00:23.236
and he is still at large continuing his crime

00:00:23.476 --> 00:00:27.172
his next target is a rising fashion model, Jennifer

00:00:27.364 --> 00:00:31.156
so he starts to stalk his victim and records her personal life

00:00:31.252 --> 00:00:34.852
Jennifer's company turns down her application of taking a vacation

00:00:34.948 --> 00:00:39.028
so she has to go to a charitable activity that evening in a bar with her dog

00:00:39.124 --> 00:00:42.532
but gradually, she feels dizzy due to the drinking

00:00:42.628 --> 00:00:45.364
Jennifer realizes that she must have been drugged

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.916
so she wants to go to the washroom and vomit what she has drunk

00:00:49.012 --> 00:00:51.364
but in the corridor, she finds a camera

00:00:51.556 --> 00:00:53.668
which is playing her every action in the bar

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.556
then she is attacked by someone and loses her consciousness

00:00:57.748 --> 00:01:01.012
when Jennifer wakes up, she hears the sound of seabirds

00:01:01.108 --> 00:01:03.604
with dizziness, she walks to the window

00:01:03.652 --> 00:01:08.308
but soon finds that what she saw just now turns out to be a projection image

00:01:08.404 --> 00:01:11.236
she is totally frightened and cowers in the corner

00:01:11.284 --> 00:01:14.788
in the dim light, Jennifer realizes she is locked in a cell

00:01:14.836 --> 00:01:18.052
where contains a lot of personal items taken from her apartment

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.116
and a huge poster about herself

00:01:20.212 --> 00:01:22.564
she feels so scared by those things

00:01:22.708 --> 00:01:25.204
suddenly, the metal drawer on the wall is opened

00:01:25.252 --> 00:01:27.988
and there is a drink and a card with some words on it

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.244
but in anger, Jennifer doesn't take it 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.276
she throws the cup to the wall and breaks all the other things prepared for her

00:01:34.372 --> 00:01:37.396
barking an order at the hidden kidnapper to let her go

00:01:37.492 --> 00:01:39.940
but her resistance is made in vain

00:01:40.036 --> 00:01:44.212
oppressed by a burst of narcotic gas, Jennifer soon faints again

00:01:44.404 --> 00:01:45.508
when she wakes up

00:01:45.604 --> 00:01:50.452
she finds herself lying on an operating table which is used to punish other victims before

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.484
in front of her, there is a television playing a cruel recording about a girl 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.356
being abused with acid

00:01:56.452 --> 00:02:00.772
though the girl was crying and begging for mercy, she was killed nevertheless

00:02:00.916 --> 00:02:04.948
now it seems that the kidnapper intends to treat Jennifer the same way

00:02:05.188 --> 00:02:06.772
Jennifer is in great horror 

00:02:06.916 --> 00:02:10.708
she begs in despair for the kidnapper to stop, but to no avail

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.684
some unknown liquid drips down on her face

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.460
then she faints again

00:02:15.604 --> 00:02:17.860
later, Jennifer wakes up from the nightmare

00:02:17.956 --> 00:02:20.740
and she can feel her face tied up in bandages

00:02:20.884 --> 00:02:24.964
but under the bandages, the wound on her face is just a fake one

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.884
Jennifer is totally confused

00:02:27.028 --> 00:02:30.244
she then takes the key from the drawer and opens the cupboard 

00:02:30.388 --> 00:02:32.548
seeing that there is a set of revealing suit

00:02:32.644 --> 00:02:36.436
immediately she tears the suit and throws it away in anger

00:02:36.484 --> 00:02:38.980
which however, brings her a lot of suffering

00:02:39.028 --> 00:02:43.972
the room is soon flooded with the hash sound that makes her feel extremely painful

00:02:44.068 --> 00:02:47.860
she can't bear it, but hide under the bed to alleviate the pain

00:02:47.956 --> 00:02:49.636
after the sound fades out

00:02:49.684 --> 00:02:54.916
Jennifer finds a dropped blade and uses it to remove the screws of the ventilation duct

00:02:54.964 --> 00:02:56.644
she then squeezes into the duct 

00:02:56.932 --> 00:02:59.188
but before she can move a little further

00:02:59.332 --> 00:03:02.548
the duct is suddenly sawed, and she is stuck in the middle

00:03:02.644 --> 00:03:06.868
the kidnapper grabs her arm and forces her to take a shot of anesthetic

00:03:06.964 --> 00:03:11.092
causing her to faint again and be confined to the operation table 

00:03:11.188 --> 00:03:12.820
to make her obey him totally

00:03:12.916 --> 00:03:16.276
the kidnapper mashes fragments of other people's bodies into pulp

00:03:16.468 --> 00:03:18.772
and forces Jennifer to swallow it all

00:03:18.868 --> 00:03:20.500
while Jennifer falls asleep

00:03:20.596 --> 00:03:23.092
the kidnapper continues to make a book collection

00:03:23.188 --> 00:03:25.924
about the details of torturing and killing her

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:27.748
on the other hand, Jennifer wakes up 

00:03:27.844 --> 00:03:31.252
and finds some light piercing through the paint on the glass wall

00:03:31.348 --> 00:03:34.612
she checks it and discovers a few words on the glass

00:03:34.708 --> 00:03:39.796
in that way, Jennifer knows about a man Gary who is also abducted in the opposite cell

00:03:39.892 --> 00:03:43.012
the man gives her a box of matches through the shutters

00:03:43.108 --> 00:03:47.524
Jennifer lights the match, so that they can see a small part of each other's faces 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.988
then they begin to talk about their experience after being kept in captivity

00:03:52.084 --> 00:03:55.204
Jennifer and Gary decide to escape from there together

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.460
when she wakes up from a dream the next day

00:03:57.508 --> 00:04:00.292
Gary already cleans up all the paint on the wall

00:04:00.436 --> 00:04:03.172
so they can see each other very clearly now

00:04:03.364 --> 00:04:06.580
but it seems that the kidnapper is just playing games with them 

00:04:06.628 --> 00:04:08.740
he can know everything behind the screen

00:04:08.788 --> 00:04:11.524
watching them talking about their escaping plan

00:04:11.716 --> 00:04:13.780
he turns off the light to scare Jennifer 

00:04:13.828 --> 00:04:16.708
and then comes to Gary's room and knocks him out

00:04:16.852 --> 00:04:19.060
Jennifer shrinks in the corner with fear

00:04:19.108 --> 00:04:22.420
but the kidnapper comes to her and makes her faint again

00:04:22.612 --> 00:04:23.860
when Jennifer wakes up

00:04:23.956 --> 00:04:25.972
she finds herself locked in confinement 

00:04:26.068 --> 00:04:28.564
which is slowly filled up with the falling sand

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.700
outside the space, there is a sandglass counting down the time of her death

00:04:33.844 --> 00:04:37.588
while Jennifer can do nothing but cry out in despair

00:04:37.876 --> 00:04:40.468
fortunately, Gary wakes up at the same time

00:04:40.612 --> 00:04:43.492
and he begins to find a way to save Jennifer

00:04:43.684 --> 00:04:47.092
soon after, he discovers a leak in the ventilation duct

00:04:47.332 --> 00:04:50.836
he takes an iron bar and crawls through the duct to get her

00:04:50.932 --> 00:04:54.196
at the very critical moment, Gary breaks the top of the space 

00:04:54.292 --> 00:04:56.404
and helps her escape the confinement 

00:04:56.596 --> 00:04:59.716
then they escape through the duct and search to another room

00:04:59.908 --> 00:05:04.372
in dim light, they find a totally festered female body in a bathtub

00:05:04.516 --> 00:05:06.724
the kidnapper comes to catch them

00:05:06.772 --> 00:05:09.400
so they run to the garage and get into the car

00:05:09.549 --> 00:05:12.477
trying to smash through the shutter door for escape

00:05:12.573 --> 00:05:15.357
but Gary loses his consciousness due to the crash

00:05:15.405 --> 00:05:19.965
locked inside the car, Jennifer is also knocked out by the sleeping gas

00:05:20.205 --> 00:05:22.317
as a punishment for an attempt to escape

00:05:22.365 --> 00:05:25.197
the kidnapper even forces her to kill her dog

00:05:25.341 --> 00:05:29.229
when waking up again, she finds that she is changed into a new dress

00:05:29.325 --> 00:05:31.485
and Gary is put in the adjoining cell

00:05:31.581 --> 00:05:36.045
she realizes the kidnapper may want to control them both mentally and physically

00:05:36.141 --> 00:05:40.605
so she opens the cupboard with the key and wears the attractive dress prepared for her

00:05:40.653 --> 00:05:43.341
making herself hormone-charming to the kidnapper

00:05:43.437 --> 00:05:46.749
it seems that the kidnapper is pleased by her obedience 

00:05:46.845 --> 00:05:50.061
he allows Gary and Jennifer to be together in one cell

00:05:50.253 --> 00:05:52.077
but then he turns off its lights

00:05:52.173 --> 00:05:56.349
and plays a recording on television about how he tortured other victims before

00:05:56.445 --> 00:06:00.333
Gary can't bear it anymore and breaks the monitor in anger

00:06:00.381 --> 00:06:02.349
resulting in the punishments to him

00:06:02.493 --> 00:06:06.381
he is tied to the operation table suffering endless tortures

00:06:06.621 --> 00:06:11.229
Jennifer is so worried about him, but her own situation is no better than Gary

00:06:11.325 --> 00:06:14.733
the kidnapper ties her up on the operation table with Gary

00:06:14.781 --> 00:06:17.709
and plays a video about the kidnapper's own childhood 

00:06:17.805 --> 00:06:22.029
from that, Jennifer gets to know the kidnapper killed his mother, who was a drug addict

00:06:22.077 --> 00:06:24.669
and recorded the bloody crime scenes 

00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:28.653
Jennifer is terrified to see the killing and trembles in fear

00:06:28.749 --> 00:06:31.629
the kidnapper shows up later with a pair of pliers 

00:06:31.773 --> 00:06:33.837
trying to make her suffer the pain

00:06:34.125 --> 00:06:38.205
in order to distract him away from Jennifer, Gary confronts the kidnapper

00:06:38.253 --> 00:06:40.941
but at the expense of losing one of his teeth

00:06:41.133 --> 00:06:44.349
Jennifer is touched by Gary for what he did to protect her

00:06:44.445 --> 00:06:49.005
so she offers him a fast hormone game as compensation for his lost tooth

00:06:49.149 --> 00:06:53.085
two minutes later, Gary gets up while Jennifer falls to sleep

00:06:53.181 --> 00:06:56.109
right then, he seems not so helpless as before

00:06:56.445 --> 00:06:59.613
he uses a card to open a secret door behind the mirror

00:06:59.709 --> 00:07:02.157
walking up the stairs, he comes to a room 

00:07:02.253 --> 00:07:04.797
which seems to be the bedroom of the kidnapper

00:07:04.941 --> 00:07:08.637
there, the television is still playing the killing of the kidnapper's mother

00:07:08.733 --> 00:07:12.765
before the woman died, she called out the name of her son-Gary

00:07:13.005 --> 00:07:16.077
it reveals that Gary and the kidnapper are brothers

00:07:16.317 --> 00:07:19.341
they kidnap young girls to satisfy their own lust

00:07:19.581 --> 00:07:21.875
but after being together with Jennifer these days

00:07:21.974 --> 00:07:25.046
he really thinks that Jennifer is the Miss Right in his life

00:07:25.238 --> 00:07:27.350
so he hopes his brother can let her go

00:07:27.446 --> 00:07:29.990
but the brother tells him that woman is untrustworthy

00:07:30.134 --> 00:07:32.486
the best way to memorize his favorite girl 

00:07:32.534 --> 00:07:35.750
is to keep her face in the recordings and collection books

00:07:35.846 --> 00:07:39.878
Gary soon understands that it is impossible to persuade his brother in words

00:07:39.974 --> 00:07:41.798
so he resorts to action

00:07:41.894 --> 00:07:45.734
he stabs his brother in the chest and then drags him into the tub

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:47.846
as he plans to leave there with Jennifer

00:07:47.894 --> 00:07:50.870
he's astonished to find two unexpected detectives 

00:07:50.918 --> 00:07:54.854
who visit to investigate his brother based on some clues they have got

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:58.598
despite Gary telling them that his brother is not at home for the time being

00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:00.470
the two enter the house

00:08:00.614 --> 00:08:04.454
while waiting for his brother, they begin to watch the football game on the TV

00:08:04.502 --> 00:08:07.622
but later happen to see Jennifer locked in the basement 

00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:11.318
Gary has no choice but to shots the two detectives

00:08:11.366 --> 00:08:13.382
then he comes back to wakes Jennifer up

00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:16.742
lying that he has killed the perpetrators when they are inattentive

00:08:16.886 --> 00:08:18.518
but when they are out of the basement

00:08:18.566 --> 00:08:21.926
one of the detectives who has survived charges at Jennifer

00:08:22.118 --> 00:08:25.766
mistaking him for the kidnapper, the panicking Jennifer takes a bat 

00:08:25.814 --> 00:08:27.926
and beats the detective to death

00:08:28.118 --> 00:08:32.726
Gary says something to comfort Jennifer and tells her they need to clean the mess

00:08:32.774 --> 00:08:35.318
and the recordings of this room need to be destroyed

00:08:35.414 --> 00:08:38.438
so that no one will know she has killed someone here

00:08:38.534 --> 00:08:43.238
still in great panic, Jennifer agrees with everything he said and stays upstairs

00:08:43.286 --> 00:08:45.638
waiting for Gary to clean up all the bloody mess

00:08:45.734 --> 00:08:48.902
but soon, she discovers several collections in a cupboard 

00:08:48.998 --> 00:08:51.158
labeled with different names, respectively

00:08:51.254 --> 00:08:53.174
one of them even shows her name

00:08:53.318 --> 00:08:55.718
driven by curiosity, she opens the book

00:08:55.814 --> 00:08:59.126
and is horrified to find that it records all the details of the plan 

00:08:59.174 --> 00:09:00.950
of how to kidnap and tame her 

00:09:01.046 --> 00:09:03.926
and the incriminating photos with Gary in it as well

00:09:04.214 --> 00:09:07.718
she is shocked by the truth and suddenly attacked by Gary's brother

00:09:07.766 --> 00:09:11.030
who survives the deadly blow thanks to his fat body

00:09:11.126 --> 00:09:15.110
however, Jennifer struggles to fight back and finally kills him 

00:09:15.206 --> 00:09:18.758
then she wants to escape away from the house immediately

00:09:18.806 --> 00:09:21.062
but the doors and windows are all locked

00:09:21.158 --> 00:09:23.606
at the same time, she hears a ringing bell

00:09:23.702 --> 00:09:26.774
which seems to be from the cellphone of one of the dead men

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:28.070
she races to check it 

00:09:28.166 --> 00:09:32.294
and realizes the man who she has just killed is actually a detective

00:09:32.534 --> 00:09:35.846
she tries to calm down and pretends to be obedient to Gary

00:09:35.894 --> 00:09:37.334
helping him with the cleaning

00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:41.462
right then, she takes a choice to spray the pungent liquid into his eyes

00:09:41.558 --> 00:09:44.678
while Gary is struggling, Jennifer returns to the basement 

00:09:44.774 --> 00:09:46.886
and breaks the main power switch

00:09:46.982 --> 00:09:51.302
then she goes back to her cell and finds a gun left by Gary's brother

00:09:51.398 --> 00:09:54.230
however, she doesn't know how to use it at all

00:09:54.326 --> 00:09:57.590
so soon after, she is overpowered by the coming Gary

00:09:57.734 --> 00:10:00.278
but Jennifer doesn't just wait to be killed

00:10:00.374 --> 00:10:02.486
observing how Gary is using the gun

00:10:02.534 --> 00:10:05.702
Jennifer rises to fight against Gary at her full strength

00:10:05.798 --> 00:10:09.686
she manages to grabs the gun back and shoots Gary down in blood

00:10:09.782 --> 00:10:15.446
then she breaks the huge poster and uncovers a secret passage leading to outside

00:10:15.638 --> 00:10:18.134
she flees out of the damned house, finally 

00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:23.510
Jennifer is relieved with pleasure and joy after her survival from the horrible abduction

00:10:23.798 --> 00:10:26.726
this's Daniel CC movie channel, peace out
