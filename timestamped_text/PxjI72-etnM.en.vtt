00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.350
Welcome to Moviecaps.

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:07.560
Today I will show you a Comedy, Romance film
from 2008, titled Yes man.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.250
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:11.309
Watch out and take care.

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.900
Carl gets barraged with calls from Peter,
but he has no intention of answering them.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.770
After all the calls he ignores, he accidentally
picks up the phone and pretends to be in his

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.310
apartment despite the fact that he’s in
a video rental store.

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.080
After an invitation to go out Carl says he
can’t because he’s too busy.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.119
But Peter knows Carl is simply making excuses
since he is spotting him standing in line

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:32.780
at the video store.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.510
Carl continues to insist that the man at the
shop is not him, despite the fact that he

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.730
caught him.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.160
Peter manages to pull him to a bar.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.399
The reason Peter invites Carl and his friend
is to announce Peter's engagement to Lucy,

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:45.960
his now-fiancee.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.630
They will have an engagement party in a few
days.

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:52.649
At the same bar, Carl's expression changes
when he sees his ex-wife Stephanie with her

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.070
new boyfriend.

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.840
He feels agitated and decides to leave, just
as she approaches him and makes for an uncomfortable

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.440
encounter and an oopsie moment.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.940
Carl's neighbor Tillie offers him breakfast,
which he refuses with all sorts of excuses.

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.030
Outside, he rejects a concert flyer handed
to him.

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.851
Even at work, Carl's buddy and supervisor
Norman invites him to his costume party at

00:01:13.851 --> 00:01:17.950
his house, but again Carl says he is going
to be out of town, before Norman tells him

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.210
the date.

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.850
Norman then mentions it will be on Friday,
but that's obviously the date Carl will be

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.170
out of town.

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.950
He also turns down numerous loan applications
from his clients.

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.430
Carl is a stubborn, mild-mannered individual.

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:35.520
During an outdoor lunch break, Carl suddenly
runs into an old friend, Nick.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.619
They tell each other about their lives.

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.869
Nick tells him about a seminar that changed
his life, like climbing a mountain or shooting

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:45.300
a cow with a bazooka, not proud of it, but
he did it.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.610
He advises Carl to try it, since he looks
miserable.

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.350
Carl declines, Nick tells him he needs to
loosen up and tells him to ask him to throw

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.200
a rock at the bank window, and he does.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.009
As he is running away, he tells him to visit
the seminar and he will not regret it.

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:05.350
After turning down an unknown caller, an orange
vendor, some flyers, and more loan applications,

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.160
he spends his after-work time watching TV
as he usually does.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.900
Carl notices Peter's call but does not take
it.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.170
Peter arrives at Carl's place, frustrated
that his friend did not show up for his engagement

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.340
party.

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.400
After all the arguing, he leaves Carl, who
has always been looking for an excuse for

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.800
his faults, and tells him that he will end
up a lonely guy if he does not change his

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:26.800
life.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.870
Peter and Rooney go to Carl's shortly after
and find his friend dead on the couch in his

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:30.870
apartment.

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.690
However, it turns out to be a dream.

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.580
Carl gets anxious about the dream, so he looks
at the brochure Nick gave him and decides

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.560
to attend the seminar.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.959
He clearly feels like a fish out of water.

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:46.440
Nick notices Carl before the seminar begins
and decides to sit next to him.

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.420
Nick convinces Carl that his life will change
after hearing from a motivational speaker.

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.370
Terrence starts the seminar and says, "Yes
is a really powerful word.

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.230
The word has the ability to absorb the good
energy of life and those who speak it can

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.069
get anything they want".

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:05.130
Terrence invites a newcomer to the podium
and Nick immediately points to Carl.

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.750
He becomes agitated because every time he
says no, the crowd yells no man, No man at

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:10.750
him.

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.620
Carl continues to refuse to climb to the top
of the podium, but then Terrence sprints up

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:15.629
to him.

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:19.849
He tells Carl that he knows he has no friends
or a relationship because he leads a repetitive

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:21.620
and boring life.

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.129
Terrence gets uncomfortably close and asks
him to make a promise that he will say yes

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:29.260
to any opportunity that comes his way, and
if Carl breaks the promise, everything in

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.230
his life will fall apart.

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.580
Carl eventually goes along with the deal.

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.590
That is some cultish persuasion going on.

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.380
As Carl is about to get into his car, a homeless
man approaches him and asks for a ride.

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:46.420
Nick notices this and rushes over to Carl
to remind him of his promise to say yes.

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.440
Carl tells him to get in and the homeless
man asks Carl to borrow his phone.

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.580
Since Nick is still in the picture, he can
not say no.

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:57.489
When they arrive at their location, the man
tells him that he had good luck lately outside

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:00.709
of the Yes Hotel and asks for all of Carl's
money.

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:04.340
Carl reluctantly says yes and the man eventually
leaves.

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.019
Just as he is about to drive off, his car
comes to a halt in the middle of nowhere on

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:09.439
an empty road.

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:11.470
His phone's battery is dead.

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.640
Carl gets angry and curses at the seminar
he attended.

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.239
Carl heads to the gas station irritated.

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:21.190
At the gas station, he notices a beautiful
woman named Allison.

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.990
She takes a pity picture of him talking to
himself.

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.290
They chat a bit and Carl tells her about the
tragedy he suffered.

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:30.330
Allison then offers to drive him to his car.

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.230
On the scooter, in the middle of the road,
Allison takes a picture of them and performs

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:36.970
a maneuver that should not be done on a road.

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:39.389
Carl looks amused as he fills up his car.

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:44.060
Then he jokes about making out and she kisses
him, and gives him the photo she took earlier.

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.110
He realizes that saying yes has got him into
a better situation.

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:52.880
Later he receives a call from Norman asking
if he can come to work today (it's Saturday).

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:57.060
He says yes to every opportunity he gets at
work, including an ad from a company you would

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.550
normally ignore.

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.390
He also approves of a loan application for
someone who wanted to start a portrait cake

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:05.449
business, something I would have definitely
turned down.

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:09.620
He tells Norman about this loan, and he thinks
it's good that Carl is showing some initiative

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.600
and tells him about the promotion talks.

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.770
Two of them bond.

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:17.550
That night, Carl meets his friends Peter and
Rooney and tells them about the seminar and

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.970
how things have changed after he started saying
yes to everything.

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:25.350
They take advantage of it and open a tab in
his name, getting him drunk and staging bizarre

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:26.350
acts.

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:30.139
At the bar, he kisses a random stranger and
her boyfriend intervenes and tells him they

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:32.120
need to take it outside.

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.890
Once outside, Carl is barely on his feet.

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:38.590
He gets punched in the liver and his friends
break up the fight, but Carl still taunts

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:41.160
him by telling his GF to call him.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:45.310
The next sunny morning, Tillie asks Carl to
put up a shelf in her house.

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:49.210
She appreciates Carl's help and offers to
pay him for his work, but she is out of money

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:52.110
and approaches him telling how handsome he
is.

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:54.960
Instead of cash, she offers him a release.

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.250
Carl is uncomfortable and refuses.

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:00.819
Then bad things start happening to Carl as
he leaves Tillie's house.

00:06:00.819 --> 00:06:03.580
Carl thinks it's because he turned down Tillie's
offer.

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:06.780
He returns and I'll leave the rest to your
imagination.

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:09.259
His belief in saying yes grows stronger.

00:06:09.259 --> 00:06:13.270
He says yes to everything, Norms Harry Potter
costume party invitation.

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:15.020
Girl Scouts.

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:16.320
Guitar lessons.

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:17.600
Flying lessons.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.440
Korean language lessons.

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:20.860
Helping the homeless.

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:23.660
And concert flyers he kept turning down.

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:27.460
In the evening, Carl goes to the bar for a
concert from the flyer.

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:29.700
It turns out that Allison is there.

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:31.490
Carl's expression brightens.

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:35.130
She performs for 5 people; some songs were
actually good.

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:39.260
He is waiting at the bar counter after Allison
finishes her performance, he pretends not

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:40.770
to notice her.

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:42.699
Allison notices him and says hi.

00:06:42.699 --> 00:06:46.850
She tells him that she has to work early in
the morning as a running photography trainer.

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:50.340
She asks Carl if he wants to come along, and
he says yes.

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:53.130
They share a very lovely moment together.

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:57.699
When Carl is about to sleep, Rooney suddenly
calls him to go for an all-nighter party.

00:06:57.699 --> 00:07:00.080
And of course, Carl says yes.

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:04.330
The next day he comes to Allison's class from
a rave with loud music and tons of red bull

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:05.330
cans.

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:08.030
He says he's very excited to attend her class.

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:10.919
Carl runs fast while taking pictures with
his phone.

00:07:10.919 --> 00:07:15.070
Midway through the run, the energy of the
Red Bulls has left him and he passes out and

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:18.560
becomes the object of a photoshoot for the
other participants.

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:22.759
When Carl comes to his senses, Allison seems
to be attracted to him because of his seemingly

00:07:22.759 --> 00:07:24.460
erratic lifestyle.

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:26.750
Carl has lunch with Faranoush and Peter.

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:30.940
He met Faranoush on a Persian website for
finding a wife (one of the ads where he clicked

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:32.250
"yes" to meet her).

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:36.319
Carl tells Peter that the magic word 'yes'
is the reason he met Allison.

00:07:36.319 --> 00:07:39.650
Lucy shows up and tells them that she does
not have anyone to help her with her bridal

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:40.650
shower.

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:44.840
Finally, Peter asks Carl to go with her since
he always says yes.

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:49.370
Lucy is shocked because she genuinely disliked
Carl because of his negative attitude.

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:53.729
Later, Carl and Allison attend Norman's Harry
Potter costume party.

00:07:53.729 --> 00:07:55.590
Is his suit toddler size?

00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:58.990
The party was nerdy and everyone watched one
of the Harry Potter movies.

00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:02.120
I mean... a couple of movies.

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:04.229
Somehow they manage to slip out of there.

00:08:04.229 --> 00:08:07.820
They decide to do some breaking and entering
in a concert hall and have a special moment

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:09.050
on the stage.

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:12.790
A bit later, they are discussing things like
the world being a playground that everyone

00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:17.450
forgets about it when they grow up, responsibilities
and so on, when suddenly a security guard

00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:19.650
arrives and they scatter.

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:23.340
Carl greets the lined debtors in the morning
and hands them oranges (presumably from the

00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:24.380
vendor).

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:27.370
His friend Lee is already waiting in his office.

00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:30.940
Suddenly Norman calls Carl out and tells him
that someone from headquarters wants to talk

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:33.330
to him about all the loans he has approved.

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:36.860
Carl asks for a minute before meeting with
the HQ person.

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:40.729
He returns to Lee to approve his presumably
last loan application.

00:08:40.729 --> 00:08:45.890
Finally, Carl meets with Wesley, the vice
president of the company he works for.

00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:51.210
Wesley says that a loan officer usually makes
35-40 loans each month, but Carl has already

00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:55.050
made 561 loans, slightly more than the average.

00:08:55.050 --> 00:09:00.070
In the midst of the tension, Wesley suddenly
laughs, Carl and Norman follow his laugh.

00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:04.580
It turns out that 98% of the debtors have
paid off their debts, giving the company big

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:05.810
profits.

00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:07.700
Carl is offered to work at the HQ.

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:10.519
Don’t have to tell you what his answer is.

00:09:10.519 --> 00:09:14.260
As promised, Carl shows up to help Lucy prepare
for her wedding.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:17.170
The clerk at the store seems irritated to
help them.

00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:22.180
When a clerk expresses her dissatisfaction
in Korean, Carl's Korean skills come in handy.

00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:26.190
He asks her in Korean what's wrong, and the
clerk explains that she's jealous of a married

00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:28.800
couple and wonders when she'll be the bride.

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:32.080
After Carl cheers her up, she helps them with
their matters.

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:36.750
A man bursts through the store entrance shouting
that someone is ready to jump off a ledge.

00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:38.630
Carl goes over immediately.

00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:42.330
At the scene, someone shouts to help the man,
which is Carl's queue.

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:45.800
He runs up the stairs and tries to talk him
out of it when the man tells him not to try

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:47.080
and stop him.

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:50.470
Carl becomes confused about what to do, as
he can't say no.

00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:52.970
In the apartment, he finds a guitar.

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:56.330
Carl starts singing and playing the guitar
to calm the man down.

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:59.100
The man and the bystanders sing along with
Carl.

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:02.260
Finally, he drags the man into the apartment.

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:06.500
When Carl is at the airport, he runs into
his ex-wife Stephanie, who says she saw Carl

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:08.890
save a man's life on TV.

00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:12.400
After they say goodbye, she looks back as
if she misses him.

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:16.810
Carl and Allison arrive at the ticket counter
and ask for the fastest departure scheduled.

00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:20.779
The ticket clerk tells them that the fastest
scheduled flight is to Nebraska.

00:10:20.779 --> 00:10:22.490
So they fly to Nebraska.

00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:26.770
They visit a telephone museum, a shooting
field, and a football game that Carl's friends

00:10:26.770 --> 00:10:28.019
are watching.

00:10:28.019 --> 00:10:30.529
Their next stop is the chicken slaughterhouse.

00:10:30.529 --> 00:10:34.480
As the instructor describes how to cut off
the chicken's head, Carl faints.

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:38.920
Later, Allison and Carl are walking together
when it suddenly starts to rain.

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:42.050
He wraps Allison in his jacket and runs to
a barn.

00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:46.490
When they arrive, Allison looks at Carl warmly
and confesses that she loves him, and tells

00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:48.640
him that she wants to live together.

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:51.329
Carl thinks it’s a big move for both of
them.

00:10:51.329 --> 00:10:53.480
Allison starts to regret what she said.

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:58.050
He doesn’t want to make her sad, so he convinces
her that he also wants to live with her.

00:10:58.050 --> 00:11:00.490
At the airport Two FBI agents approach them.

00:11:00.490 --> 00:11:05.760
They are suspicious about Carl's activities,
like purchasing random tickets, visiting dating

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:10.180
websites, learning to fly an aircraft, and
taking Korean courses.

00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:13.730
Carl is puzzled and seeks Peter's assistance
as his lawyer.

00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:18.110
Peter tells the FBI that his friend once attended
a seminar that required him to say yes to

00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:19.110
everything.

00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:23.620
Allison, who heard Peter's explanation, becomes
disappointed and annoyed.

00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:27.390
She thinks Carl has been with her all this
time because he always has to say yes to all

00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:28.820
her requests.

00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:32.579
He tries to explain to Allison that he is
completely sincere to her.

00:11:32.579 --> 00:11:34.550
She ignores him and leaves.

00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:39.330
Back at the airport in LA, Carl tries to talk
to her, but she just tells him to stay away,

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:40.610
which he does.

00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:44.060
He's back to his old self, watching movies
at home.

00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:45.880
Allison will not take his calls.

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:50.060
Carl tries to distract himself with a bungee
jump, when Wesley calls, which he answers

00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:51.600
while still hanging.

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:56.180
He tells him that HQ has decided to close
the branch where Carl used to work.

00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:59.060
Carl visits Norman to tell him the sad news.

00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:03.930
As he listens to his voicemails, he looks
around his cluttered apartment, dissatisfied.

00:12:03.930 --> 00:12:08.529
One of the messages is from Peter, reminding
him of the bridal shower tomorrow night.

00:12:08.529 --> 00:12:11.790
Carl is distraught because he has completely
forgotten about it.

00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:16.330
Carl somehow manages to throw a huge party
to which he invites everyone he knows.

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:20.450
Lucy and Peter are shocked that so many people
are attending their wedding shower.

00:12:20.450 --> 00:12:24.060
Carl notices Norman sitting glumly at the
counter and wonders if he's okay now that

00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:25.709
the branch has closed.

00:12:25.709 --> 00:12:30.160
To cheer him up, Carl invites his Korean friend
he met at the store, and introduces them to

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:31.329
each other.

00:12:31.329 --> 00:12:33.680
They become friends and have a good time.

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:36.250
Lucy shows Carl that he has done a good job.

00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:40.680
Nevertheless, in the middle of the celebration,
Carl tries to call Allison, but she declines

00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:41.760
the call.

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:45.621
Rooney is introduced to Tillie and she asks
him for his help with some shelfs, if you

00:12:45.621 --> 00:12:47.029
know what I mean.

00:12:47.029 --> 00:12:50.850
When Carl gets home, Stephanie calls him and
asks him to come over.

00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:54.459
She tells Carl that she and Ted had a big
fight and he stormed off.

00:12:54.459 --> 00:12:57.990
Stephanie asks Carl to stay the night, but
Carl says NO.

00:12:57.990 --> 00:13:00.470
When he leaves, he has a run of bad luck.

00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:03.300
The elevator he is in suddenly breaks down.

00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:07.140
Carl becomes extremely paranoid and gets scared
of a cat that makes him bump into someone

00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:08.529
else's car.

00:13:08.529 --> 00:13:11.720
His car is towed away and he begins to hallucinate.

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:14.000
Carl hides in Terrence's car.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.860
Terrence panics when Carl unexpectedly shows
up in his car and causes an accident that

00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:20.149
lands them both in the hospital.

00:13:20.149 --> 00:13:24.100
The reason he wants to meet with Terrence
is to undo the promise they made.

00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:26.520
Terrence then reveals that the deal was a
bluff.

00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:30.209
The word "yes" should be used to open up to
people and then the decision should be based

00:13:30.209 --> 00:13:31.890
on your heart.

00:13:31.890 --> 00:13:35.810
Carl asks Rooney what time it is, and when
he hears it's early morning, he storms out

00:13:35.810 --> 00:13:37.060
of the room.

00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:40.660
On his way, he runs into Lee and asks to borrow
his ride.

00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:45.110
Thanks to Carl's earlier approval of the loan,
he now owns a Ducati motorcycle.

00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:49.640
Carl rides off while still wearing the patient's
clothes and exposing his booty.

00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:53.050
Carl crashes Alison's class, entering like
a badass.

00:13:53.050 --> 00:13:56.820
He tells her that he does not want to live
with her, that kind of decision takes time,

00:13:56.820 --> 00:14:00.630
he explains that what he did was wrong and
that he misinterpreted Terrence's words all

00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:01.710
along.

00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:05.330
He tells her that he would not have met her
if he had not said yes to everything.

00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:10.399
He praises her on how great she is and they
reconcile with a long, passionate kiss.

00:14:10.399 --> 00:14:11.779
The End.

00:14:11.779 --> 00:14:13.200
Thank you for watching!
