00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.200
Hello Everyone!

00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:05.540
This is Mr. Brain Junkie Here, and Today we'll
be talking about an action fantasy film called

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.749
the tales of Wukong, be ready for some spoilers
ahead!

00:00:09.749 --> 00:00:14.159
A long time ago, There's a machine in the
heavens called the destiny Astrolabe, that

00:00:14.159 --> 00:00:17.099
is capable of controlling the fates of mortals.

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:21.820
When the goddess Nwa saved the world by sealing
the sky with a sacred stone, a Giant was also

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.090
born from it's remainders.

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:28.030
The monster refused to accept his fate, and
fought against the heavens in order to destroy

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:29.749
the destiny astrolabe.

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:34.560
The celestial armies were able to defeat the
giant and scatter his body across the land,

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.630
where eventually it became the flower mountain
and the heart stone gave life to the monkey demon.

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:44.550
However, the Destiny Astrolabe summons a series
of disasters that left the flower mountain

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.010
in ruins, and the monkey demon swears to take
vengeance on the heavens.

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.720
The main character WuKong arrives at the immortal's
academy, where the head master will select

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.670
individuals worthy of entering the heaven
and becoming immortal.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.370
Instead of attending the ceremony, he steals
food from the kitchen, which causes the captain

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.330
of the guards to not receives his food
from the server.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.290
The man bullies the girl and escalates the
situation to where he attacks her with his

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:14.990
weapon, but luckily, a recent graduate, Juanlian,
protects her from the devastating hit.

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.210
This only makes the soldier angrier, and Juanlian
gets knocked across the room.

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.940
However, the captain gets kicked by another
Deity named AhZi, and she embarrasses him

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.210
in front of the crowd.

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.250
The man becomes furious and sends the guards
to attack the girl, but they are quickly tossed

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.780
aside by Wukong, who grabs onto the captain
and kicks him through the tables.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.010
Numerous guards arrive into the room and surrounds
Wukong, but he summons his weapon from his

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.040
ear, which turns into a staff that's made
from lava.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.380
The soldiers charge at the man, but he summons
the flames from the weapon, which causes a

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.710
huge explosion that sends the enemies flying
backwards.

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.680
General Hua of the celestial army is notified
of the fight in the ceremony, and sends her

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.290
right hand man Tien to resolve the situation.

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.450
Wukong looks at the soldiers lying on the
floor and smirks in satisfaction, but quickly

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.900
senses the incoming danger as Tien flys in
to attack him with numerous daggers.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.599
Wukong is able to counter the strikes, but
the numerous blades make it difficult for

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:12.439
him to land any direct hit.

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:18.010
The blade master sends numerous daggers towards
Wukong that turns into a giant tornado, surrounding

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.069
him in a twister of blades.

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:24.590
After being cornered with no way out, Wukong
slams the staff onto the floor, and it begins

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.269
growing to an incredible size that eventually
hits the ceiling.

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:32.969
He kicks the massive weapon as it drops towards
Tien, breaking open the flying blades.

00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:37.989
The blade master dodges the attack, but Wukong
grabs the staff and hurls it at the opponent,

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:39.939
Forcing Tien to leap into the air.

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:45.239
AhZi tells them to stop, but WUkong is unable
to withdraw his attack that's heading her way.

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:49.319
The weapon slams into the girl, but she appears
to have stopped it with one finger.

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:53.730
However, it turns out that another man stopped
the attack using one hand while trying to

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.800
protect the girl, and he calls himself Erlang.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.359
The man reveals his right arm that's imbued
with godly powers and punches the giant staff

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:05.010
towards Wukong, which breaks the weapon as
it flys backwards.

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.129
Wukong retracts the staff and leaps into the
air, planning to destroy his opponent with

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:10.239
a final attack,

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:14.620
but Erlang charges towards the man and proceeds
to land a devastating punch that throws the

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.139
main character into the walls, knocking him
out in the process.

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:22.310
The guards are able to capture Wukong and
lock him into the cells, while the head master

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.280
apologizes profusely towards General Hua for
the incident.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.059
AhZi arrives as well and begins complaining
about why his friend Erlang was also imprisoned

00:03:31.059 --> 00:03:34.519
alongside Wukong, since all he did was stop
the fight.

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:38.980
The general explains that Erlang disobeyed
her orders by fighting, when she only commanded

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.650
Tien to resolve the situation.

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.019
It turns out that AhZi is the daughter of
the general, but their relationship is clearly

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:50.059
strained as the girl dislikes her mother's
habit of imposing her will onto everyone.

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:54.489
At the same time, the two men are locked into
the same prison, and Wukong complains about

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:57.799
how their previous fight was unfair since
it was two on one.

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:02.689
He demands to fight Erlang again, but when
the man refuses, Wukong begins insulting Erlang's

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:06.189
mother who was punished by the general for
loving a mortal.

00:04:06.189 --> 00:04:10.419
This infuriates the man, and just before they
start fighting again, the general arrives

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:12.739
to the prison accompanied by Tien.

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:16.989
She unchains Erlang and tells him to wait
for her in the council, while Wukong continues

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:19.840
to complain about why his rival was set free.

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.060
The general takes out the crown of binding
and puts it on the head of the prisoner.

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.550
She begins chanting and the crown shrinks,
causing immense pain to Wukong as he screams

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:31.530
on the floor, eventually fainting to the pressure.

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.650
She give her daughter the scepter capable
of controlling the crown and tells AhZi to

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.909
keep the man under supervision at all times.

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:42.560
Wukong begins dreaming about his past, and
it turns out that he was the demon monkey

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.060
created by the heart stone.

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:49.100
A deity took pity on him and saved him from
dying, but also sealing his powers inside

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:52.640
the human form in order to save him from the
wrath of gods.

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:57.379
At the same time, General Hua lectures Erlang
about his unwillingness to let go of human

00:04:57.379 --> 00:05:02.699
emotions, which prevents him from opening
his third eye that would grant him immense powers

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:08.009
She tells him to forget about his mother and
Ahzi, so that he may become a true deity.

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:12.770
Wukong wakes up finding himself with Ahzi,
and swears that he'll regain freedom by removing

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:13.770
the bindings.

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:18.180
He screams at her in anger, but when Azhi
takes out the scepter, Wukong quickly bows

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:22.110
down to the girl, trying to avoid the pain
that he experienced before.

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:26.330
He goes to a seminar where the headmaster
is showing the students how the heaven works.

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:30.520
They cross the bridge that separates the realm
from the mortals, which the man claims would

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:33.740
take away their powers once they fall into
the waters.

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:38.190
The room eventually leads to the Destiny Astrolabe,
where all mortal affairs are controlled by

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:39.449
the machine.

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:43.500
General Hua begins lecturing the crowd abut
the history of the heaven, and purposely speaks

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:47.810
about the annihilation of flower mountain
in order to test Wukong's true objective for

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:48.830
being here.

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:53.210
the monkey demon becomes furious at hearing
the woman's compassionless rant, but before

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:58.789
he can do anything hasty, AhZi interrupt her
mother and publicly disagrees with her ideals.

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:03.199
She argues that heaven is supposed to represent
justice, and questions how destroying someone's

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:05.470
home can represent such ideal?

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:09.250
The general states that everything is done
according to the Destiny Astrolabe, which

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:11.400
is the ultimate justice.

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:16.039
After purposely enraging the monkey demon,
general Hua confirms that the demon who attacked

00:06:16.039 --> 00:06:21.189
the heavens before still lives on inside Wukong,
and orders Tien to retrieve the heart stone

00:06:21.189 --> 00:06:22.729
by killing him.

00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:26.659
Wukong manages to trick Juanlian and knocks
him out while taking his key that opens the

00:06:26.659 --> 00:06:28.390
gates to the councils.

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:32.330
He jumps on the bridge of destiny, planning
to destroy the astrolabe, freeing all the

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:36.840
mortals from their predestined fates, but
Erlang stops him from his attacks and warns

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:38.389
him about breaking the laws

00:06:38.389 --> 00:06:42.409
the man takes out his sword and charges at
the monkey demon, stabbing the the staff and

00:06:42.409 --> 00:06:44.370
freezing it's fire elements.

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:48.840
He throws Wukong on the floor, and continues
to strike him with a fury of slashes, but

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:51.240
the demon manages to dodge all the attacks.

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:55.660
Their fight begins to damage the bridge itself
which causes a storm to arise.

00:06:55.660 --> 00:07:00.099
AhZi realizes that something is wrong, when
she finds Juanlian unconscious in the kitchen

00:07:00.099 --> 00:07:01.300
with the keys missing.

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:06.020
Tien joins the fight against Wukong at the
order of the general, and the two begins attacking

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:10.960
the demon together with multiple strikes and
overpowers Wukong with their combined efforts.

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:15.331
AhZi arrives at the bridge with Juanlian,
and tries to tell them to stop, but Wukong

00:07:15.331 --> 00:07:21.150
strikes the floor and enlarges the staff after
being cornered, which destroys the structure completely.

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:26.289
The group falls from the sky alongside the
giant weapon and crashes into the land of the mortals

00:07:26.289 --> 00:07:30.569
The group survives the fall, and questions
their location, but Tien realizes that they

00:07:30.569 --> 00:07:33.400
have landed on what used to be the flower
mountain.

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:37.490
The three man continues to fight each other,
but soon realizes that their powers are gone

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:39.930
after entering through the bridge of destiny.

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:44.169
Their fights are cut short when a large cloud
begins to form on top of the village, and

00:07:44.169 --> 00:07:47.860
the villagers rush into the building in fear
of the demon that is about to wreak havoc

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:49.090
on the town.

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:53.240
The cloud monster begins taking the people
as it steals the water from the humans.

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:58.470
Tien sees a child outside and to his surprise,
a woman runs to protect the boy from danger

00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:03.840
He rushes to save them and carries them inside,
but gets held on by the cloud demon and pulled

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:05.379
towards the center.

00:08:05.379 --> 00:08:11.050
Before the man can be completely consumed,
Wukong grabs onto him alongside with everyone else.

00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:15.560
Ahzi shoots the cloud demon with an ice arrow
that Juanlian invented, freezing the monster

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:17.340
and forcing it to retreat.

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:22.330
The next morning, Wukong wakes up and realizes
that he's tied up by AhZi in order to prevent

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:24.319
further fighting amongst the group.

00:08:24.319 --> 00:08:28.290
She tells Wukong and Erlang that they have
to help the villagers, as the people have

00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:32.400
suffered a great deal and thinks that they
are deities sent from heaven.

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:36.960
The two refuses at first, but after seeing
the misfortunes that the villagers are suffering

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:41.490
from with their own eyes, they decide to capture
the cloud demon and save the people together.

00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:46.380
Tien explains that the cloud used to be from
the heavens, but wondered off and became corrupted

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:48.710
by the demonic auras from the ruins.

00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:53.830
It took all the water from the village, therefore
causing drought and preventing any crops to grow.

00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:57.950
They plan to trick the monster and capture
it by projecting a sunset, and weaken it by

00:08:57.950 --> 00:09:00.220
firing ice bombs in a large cannon.

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:04.390
The people put up all the red cloth that they
have in a pattern, and soon the sky begins

00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:07.080
turning black as the demon appears over the
village.

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:11.920
They began shooting ice arrows at the sky,
but that only manages to annoy the monster

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:13.370
as it retreats temporarily.

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:18.040
Tien grabs the torch and throws it under the
field of red cloth, creating the illusion

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:22.720
of a sunset which triggers the monster as
it begins revealing it's true form.

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:27.140
The demon approaches closer, and Wukong takes
this opportunity to load up the cannon and

00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:29.350
fires directly at the demon's face.

00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:33.750
The monster freezes quickly and falls towards
the city where Tien capture it by trapping

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:35.300
it within a cage.

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:39.280
The people begin cheering as the sky finally
rains after years of drought.

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:44.340
At night, the villagers gather together as
they celebrate the victory against the demon,

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:48.590
but Juanlian feels something wrong as ice
particles began forming in the air.

00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:53.100
He notices a mysterious figure in the background,
who appears in front of the people with dark

00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:55.100
aura surrounding his body.

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:59.460
The man attacks Juanlian and sends him crashing
into a building, while the people panic and

00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:00.730
run for shelter.

00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:04.930
The man follows the villagers inside and begins
creating ice weapons from the air, which he

00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:06.740
unleashes at the people.

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:10.610
More assassins arrive in front of Tien as
he tries to run away, but gets stabbed by

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:13.340
the numerous ice shards across his body.

00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:17.530
Wukong notices something wrong in the air
and runs towards the town center, but when

00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:21.480
they arrive inside the building, they see
that all the people are killed.

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:24.170
Erlang arrives as well, and is shocked at
what happened.

00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:28.920
They look at Juanlian who's barely alive,
and he apologizes for not being able to save

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:31.470
the villagers before he dies.

00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:36.041
Numerous assassins arrive outside the building,
and Wukong charges at them in fury, trying

00:10:36.041 --> 00:10:37.630
to avenges his friends.

00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:42.230
The men fires at the monkey demon as he gets
impaled by numerous ice bullets and falls

00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:43.230
to the ground.

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:47.790
The general appears and tells them that their
efforts are useless in the face of destiny,

00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:52.310
as the astrolabe has decided a long time ago
that the people were meant to die.

00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:55.810
She tells them to surrender their hopes because
everything is predestined.

00:10:55.810 --> 00:11:00.340
Wukong screams in rage as the the general
knocks him out with a final attack.

00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:05.836
AhZi wakes up in a prison cell along with
Erlang, who's accepted the rulings of the heaven.

00:11:05.836 --> 00:11:10.760
He tells her that they were wrong for disobeying
destiny and trying to save the people.

00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:14.570
Wukong is imprisoned in the deepest level
where he's constantly suffering from the worst

00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:19.210
pain imaginable, but refusing to die as he
waits for AhZi's return.

00:11:19.210 --> 00:11:24.040
The girl goes to the monkey demon and Wukong
smiles after seeing her arrival.

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:29.390
Trying to end her friend's suffering, AhZi
tells him that she despises him and that he lost everything.

00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:33.710
The flower mountain will never return and
they cannot win against destiny.

00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:39.400
Feeling heartbroken and hopeless, Wukong finally
gives up on life and slowly turns into dust,

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:42.730
while leaving behind the heart stone and the
scarf that he carries.

00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:46.990
AhZi promises that she'll finish her friend's
mission as she drops the scarf into the flower

00:11:46.990 --> 00:11:49.980
mountain where it lands inside the village.

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:54.470
Erlang brings the heart stone to the general,
and after abandoning all emotions, he opens

00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:57.830
the third eye on his forehead and receives
tremendous power.

00:11:57.830 --> 00:12:01.870
The elder Deity picks up the scarf that was
dropped from heaven, and talks with the monkey

00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:03.740
demon in purgatory.

00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:07.760
The main character thinks that he lost everything,
but the old man disagrees.

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:12.990
Although Wukong has lost the heart stone,
it also allowed him to abandon his mortal body.

00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:18.570
He must now decide whether if he wants to
accept destiny or fight against it with his own heart.

00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:23.920
Wukong begins lifting the giant staff symbolizing
his power, and resurrecting it into flames.

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:29.750
The massive weapon breaks the ground and rises
into the air as the buildings collapse around it.

00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:34.060
the monkey demon emerges from the dust, and
takes on his true form as the staff unveils

00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:35.860
itself from its outer shells.

00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:40.460
He unleashes the demon cloud that he captured
as it flys towards him, carrying the monkey

00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:43.970
demon into the air as they charge towards
the gods.

00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:47.520
Wukong lands outside of the kingdom, as he
looks upon the deities.

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:51.690
He crashes into the building, causing a large
explosion that destroys all the guards in

00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:54.670
one shot and throws the captain to the floor.

00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:59.790
He declares himself equal to the heavens and
stares directly at the celestial warriors.

00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:04.340
The demon throws the staff at the soldiers
and begins attacking them like a wild beast,

00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:08.920
ripping them apart one by one as he avenges
the people that they killed in the village.

00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:13.780
At the same time, AhZi betrays her mother
as she refuses to accept the tyranny and strike

00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:17.020
at the destiny astrolabe, trying to break
it permanently.

00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:22.130
Tien arrives beside Wukong as well after surviving
the attacks, and they begin destroying the

00:13:22.130 --> 00:13:24.580
armies with their combined efforts.

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:28.460
Before long, the soldiers are quickly defeated
as they are turned into dust.

00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:32.740
The general stops her daughter from sabotaging
the machine as she grabs her neck and slams

00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:36.640
her in the chest, knocking her into the air
with tremendous force.

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:40.830
Wukong rushes into the room and catches the
woman, as Tien prepares to fight the general

00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:41.830
to the death.

00:13:41.830 --> 00:13:45.780
He throws multiple blades at the opponent,
but she blocks them easily with the metals

00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:47.420
that she use as shields.

00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:52.010
The general then throws the man's blades back
at him and knocks him towards the wall, turning

00:13:52.010 --> 00:13:54.940
him into dust as he vanishes from this world.

00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:59.570
Wukong sees AhZi mortally wounded and tries
to comfort her, but she tells him to not be

00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:02.350
sad, only wishing that they had more time
together.

00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:07.060
The two share a last kiss and Ahzi begins
disappearing into nothingness as Wukong gently

00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:08.650
lays her own the floor.

00:14:08.650 --> 00:14:13.830
The monkey demon takes Ahzi's crown while
he cries and wraps the metal onto his weapon.

00:14:13.830 --> 00:14:17.710
He walks towards the general and plans to
avenge all the people that she killed.

00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:22.040
The woman constructs a metallic wall around
herself, but Wukong strikes it repeatedly

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:25.760
with anger and eventually manages to overpower
her magic.

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:29.920
The general is forced to teleport them outside
and begins attacking wukong with numerous

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:35.550
blades that she created, but the demon deflects
all of them easily and breaks them into pieces.

00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:40.470
Suddenly, Wukong notices that Erlang has arrived,
and gets knocked away by his attack.

00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:45.690
The man no longer feels any emotions and has
chosen to abandoned the memories of his friends.

00:14:45.690 --> 00:14:50.180
The two charges at each other and fights furiously
as they trade blows, but Erlang gains the

00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:52.880
upper hand and pushes Wukong backwards.

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:57.140
He summons a gigantic ice weapon that strikes
Wukong, pushing him towards the mountains

00:14:57.140 --> 00:14:58.930
and crashing into the rocks.

00:14:58.930 --> 00:15:03.150
The Demon counters by launching his weapon
as well, but Erlang stops it and breaks the

00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:06.000
staff pieces by piece, until he stabs Wukong
in the stomach.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.990
The Monkey throws away their weapons and the
two proceeds to punch each other with all

00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:14.490
their might, which causes a huge explosion
that engulfs the entire area.

00:15:14.490 --> 00:15:19.110
When the dust settles, General Hua walks towards
Erlang, but notices something wrong.

00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:23.580
The man begins recalling his memories after
striking Wukong and sensing Ahzi's presence

00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:25.030
in the demon's heart.

00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:30.470
He cries as he realizes her death and opens
his eyes, refusing to let go of Ahzi's memories

00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:33.290
and be treated as a puppet for the general's
control.

00:15:33.290 --> 00:15:37.410
Seeing that Erlang has betrayed her will,
The general decides to vanquish both of them

00:15:37.410 --> 00:15:41.750
by transfroming into a gigantic titan using
the metals around her.

00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:45.890
Wukong recovers from the ground and summons
a ball of flames that turns into his weapon.

00:15:45.890 --> 00:15:49.750
He throws the staff at the giant and leaps
onto the weapon as it becomes larger.

00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:54.030
He charges towards the general, as the weapon
flys closer to the titan.

00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:57.970
Erlang begins running as well and leaps onto
the floating rocks, getting closer towards

00:15:57.970 --> 00:15:58.970
the enemy.

00:15:58.970 --> 00:16:03.360
He leaps towards the center of the giant and
prepares his final attack, while Wukong jumps

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:06.310
under the giant staff and swings it at the
titan.

00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:10.750
Erlang punches through the center of the giant
as Wukong lands a direct hit on the head.

00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:14.750
The giant staff breaks the general in half
as it cuts through her body and turning her

00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:15.910
into dust.

00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:19.870
The two lands back into the building after
finally destroying the general and the machine

00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:20.870
of destiny.

00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:25.130
Erlang tells Wukong that Ahzi saved him this
time, but the next time they meet will be

00:16:25.130 --> 00:16:26.880
a battle to the death.

00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:30.560
Wukong turns around and accepts the challenge,
as the two go their separate ways.

00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:34.660
Erlang will become the new general of the
celestial army, while Wukong will gather all

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:38.780
those unwilling to accept their fates, and
wage a war against the deities that will last

00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:41.150
hundreds of years.

00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:42.950
