00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.280
Detective Recapped here. Today, I'm going to&nbsp;
explain a crime-drama film called, "Ms. .45,”&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.600
which shows how the horrors of an uncaring and&nbsp;
exploitative world can make a good woman turn bad.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.520
Also known as, ‘Angel of Vengeance’, this&nbsp;
aptly titled movie follows the story of a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.040
silent vigilante blurring the violent&nbsp;
lines between revenge and retribution.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.200
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.
‘Are you the prey or are you the hunter?’&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.720
The answer to this question shapes the way&nbsp;
a person’s life unfolds. But when the hunter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.640
becomes the hunted and the prey becomes the&nbsp;
predator, it becomes the world’s problem, too.&nbsp;

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.040
In a garment factory in Manhattan, a mute, young&nbsp;
seamstress named Thana heads home after a day of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.280
work. While walking, Thana and her friends are&nbsp;
pestered by some vulgar men, but they ignore&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.440
them as they head to a bar. Though her friends&nbsp;
try inviting her for some drinks, Thana politely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.360
refuses and goes to a supermarket instead.&nbsp;
After shopping for meat in a grocery store,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.000
Thana is walking home when suddenly, a heinous man&nbsp;
viciously grabs her. He pulls her to a back alley,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.480
and there, he forces himself onto her. Once&nbsp;
the disgusting man was done, Thana lies by the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.960
trash bin, traumatized. Mustering her remaining&nbsp;
strength, a drained Thana returns home and sits&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.440
down by her couch to recuperate from her crushing&nbsp;
incident. Already, it’s clear that Thana and her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.960
friends are navigating an environment that treats&nbsp;
them as little more than meat to be consumed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.640
From the way they’ve been ogled at and catcalled&nbsp;
with every step of the way, many of the men around&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.080
them just make the streets uncomfortable for&nbsp;
them to travel. To Thana’s friends, they were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.920
little more than a nuisance, but to Thana,&nbsp;
these men became a real and tangible danger.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.680
The unnerving thing is, it didn’t have to be&nbsp;
just Thana. Any lone woman could have taken&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.600
her place and suffered the same tragedy as her.
But just when it feels like Thana’s day couldn’t&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.240
get worse, it did. Thana is suddenly confronted&nbsp;
by a burglar, who threatens to kill her if she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.360
dares scream. Despite his demands for money,&nbsp;
Thana is unable to speak, annoying the burglar.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.440
But he soon realizes that she's mute, and upon&nbsp;
noticing her torn clothes, he decides to take&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.840
advantage of her. The burglar lays Thana on the&nbsp;
floor as he shamelessly forces himself on her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.160
repeating the evils that Thana just experienced&nbsp;
earlier. At first, Thana could only lie helplessly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.160
on the floor while the burglar continues, but in&nbsp;
a bout of quick thinking, she grabs a glass ball&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.400
near her. Hearing the burglar drop his gun, Thana&nbsp;
immediately strikes him, making him fall to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.400
floor. Thana quickly gets up and picks up an iron&nbsp;
before smashing it against the burglar's head.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.200
Dazed, Thana pulls the burglar to her bathtub.&nbsp;
As she struggles with it, she suddenly hears&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.600
a dog barking outside. She quickly fixes her&nbsp;
apartment, hides the bloody iron under the couch,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.320
then covers herself up. Finally, she cautiously&nbsp;
checks outside to see if anyone's there.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.480
After finding no one outside, Thana falls&nbsp;
to the ground in a mix of fear and relief.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.560
After being forced into one soul-crushing evil&nbsp;
after another, it’s almost a wonder how Thana can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.480
still pick herself up and fight against her second&nbsp;
assailant. Unfortunately, that’s the world Thana&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.880
lives in, and she has no other choice but to fight&nbsp;
and even kill to survive. Naturally, being the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.120
victim of a harrowing crime can change a person,&nbsp;
but killing, even if in self-defense, can also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.942
have that effect. But the ironic thing is, Thana&nbsp;
killed the burglar with an iron—something that’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.942 --> 00:02:38.320
closely associated with women in the household.
The next day in the garment factory, Thana's boss,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:43.360
Albert, scolds one of the workers there, scaring&nbsp;
the other women inside. After looking at a trash&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.240
bag, an idea strikes Thana, and she freezes in&nbsp;
shock, alarming her co-workers. As they ask her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.080
how she's feeling, Thana tries nodding at them,&nbsp;
but she soon zones out with memories from the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.480
previous night still haunting her. After work,&nbsp;
Thana heads home again and immediately goes to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.040
bathroom. She saws the burglar's body apart before&nbsp;
stuffing the pieces inside trash bags, which she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.280
then hides in her fridge. Afterwards, Thana&nbsp;
cleans up her bathroom, removing the evidence&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.360
of her brutal attacker. Once she's finished,&nbsp;
Thana stares at herself in the mirror, still&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.680
clearly traumatized from everything that happened.
Suddenly, she hears water coming from the drain,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.160
so she checks on it. There, she realizes that bits&nbsp;
of the burglar's flesh are clogging up the drain.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.840
But Thana just heads to bed and rests for&nbsp;
the night. The next morning, Thana leaves&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.280
the apartment to throw the dismembered&nbsp;
body into a trash bin along the streets.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.600
With that, she heads to work. There’s some poetic&nbsp;
justice to be had with the way the burglar’s body&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.680
has been chopped into pieces and disposed of as&nbsp;
if it were meat. In the beginning, it was Thana&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.920
and her friends who were being treated like meat&nbsp;
on display. Now, the burglar is being treated with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.720
the same disregard and brutality. In the garment&nbsp;
factory, Thana irons a dress before she zones out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.640
Still remembering the horrors of the other&nbsp;
night's ordeal, she accidentally burns the dress.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.840
Albert comes to check on her, but&nbsp;
Thana dismisses his attempts to help.&nbsp;

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.400
A few hours later, a heckler tries picking up some&nbsp;
girls along the streets but is constantly ignored.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.000
Feeling hopeless, he desperately tries looking&nbsp;
for more when he suddenly spots Thana getting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.920
off a taxi. Thana quickly walks, dropping&nbsp;
a bag of the burglar's body on the streets,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.720
and the heckler notices this. He then follows her&nbsp;
and tries to return the bag to her. Panicking,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.120
Thana runs away while the man chases her along the&nbsp;
streets. But eventually, Thana reaches a dead end,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.280
leaving her fearful of getting violated again.&nbsp;
As the heckler makes his way to her to return the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.200
bag, Thana quickly gets out the .45 pistol&nbsp;
that she got from the burglar. She shoots&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.960
the heckler with it, killing him instantly.
Thana frantically returns home, vomiting as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.280
she thinks about how she committed her second&nbsp;
murder. Suddenly, her neighbor, Ms. Nasone,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.600
quickly knocks at her door, asking if she's fine.&nbsp;
Thana answers the door, so she can nod to let&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:36.480
Mrs. Nasone know that she's okay. Unconvinced,&nbsp;
Mrs. Nasone tries to get a doctor for Thana,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.400
but she refuses before escorting Mrs. Nasone&nbsp;
out of her apartment. Later that night, Thana&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.400
nervously shifts in her bed as she dreams of the&nbsp;
traumatic things that happened to her. Now, the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.800
extent of Thana’s trauma is unfolding. Not only is&nbsp;
she ceaselessly haunted by the despicable ways in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.040
which she was violated, she is now unable to trust&nbsp;
the men who approach her. Even though the heckler&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.800
may not have been looking to force himself on her,&nbsp;
she still can’t afford to lower her guard because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.640
she must have felt that the world had already&nbsp;
punished her for doing just that. At this point,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:05.760
Thana can only trust herself and her .45 pistol.
The next day, a homeless man in the streets tries&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.760
rummaging for food in a trash bin. While searching&nbsp;
around the bin, he suddenly shrieks in horror as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:14.160
he finds one of the burglar's hands in a bag&nbsp;
that Thana threw away. Meanwhile, in the office,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.560
Albert speaks with Thana. He expresses his concern&nbsp;
over Thana's dwindling efforts with their clothing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:22.240
line. Calmly, Albert asks her to get back on&nbsp;
track with her work, adding that she should&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:27.040
be more like her co-workers. He then invites her&nbsp;
over for a Halloween party to help her calm down.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:30.640
In response, Thana writes a note to Albert,&nbsp;
telling him that she'll try before leaving&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:35.200
his office. Afterwards, her friend, Carol,&nbsp;
asks her why Albert called her to his office,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:39.200
but Thana replies through a note that she&nbsp;
wants to be left alone. Understanding Thana,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.800
Carol looks at her reassuringly before they&nbsp;
go out for lunch with some of her co-workers.&nbsp;

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.000
In the restaurant, Thana and her friends&nbsp;
are enjoying their meals when suddenly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.280
a man named Rich Volk tries introducing himself to&nbsp;
them. One of her co-workers, Laurie, rudely sways&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:55.440
Rich off before she and her friends head out,&nbsp;
leaving Thana alone in the restaurant. These women&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:59.200
really can’t catch a break. Even when they’re just&nbsp;
minding their own business and eating together,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.880
they’d still come across people like Rich,&nbsp;
who feel entitled to their time and attention.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:06.240
While approaching people isn’t a crime, there’s&nbsp;
still something to be said about how the men in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:10.160
this story are barely giving the women any room&nbsp;
to breathe without getting hounded. After fixing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:14.640
her things, Thana leaves as well, and she heads&nbsp;
over to the pedestrian crossing. Rich follows her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:18.720
and he apologizes for his earlier actions&nbsp;
before introducing himself. Thana tries to walk&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:22.960
away from him, but Rich continues to pester her,&nbsp;
bragging about his job as a fashion photographer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:27.520
before inviting her over to his studio. Thana is&nbsp;
reluctant to join him, but she eventually agrees&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:31.520
to go. The two then go to Rich's condominium,&nbsp;
where they take the elevator to the studio.&nbsp;

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:36.560
Upon their arrival, Rich heads inside alone while&nbsp;
Thana abruptly takes out her gun. She coldly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:40.640
shoots Rich then leaves him all alone in the&nbsp;
studio as she heads back home. Later that night,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:44.480
Thana puts heavy makeup on herself, contrasting&nbsp;
how she usually looks before heading out again&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:49.600
for the city. From there, Thana wreaks a bloodbath&nbsp;
around town. She saves an escort from a violent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:54.080
pimp, kills a gang of thieves, and even shoots a&nbsp;
wealthy Sheik. It's a night of havoc in Manhattan,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:58.000
and Thana has taken her self-construed&nbsp;
justice into her own hands as a vigilante.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.760
But above all, Thana has taken the role of an&nbsp;
Angel of Vengeance using the very weapon of her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:05.840
own assailant—that .45 pistol. In every step&nbsp;
of the way, the men who hurt her are the ones&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:09.680
compelling Thana and giving her the ability to&nbsp;
kill. Her using that pistol can be the image of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:13.280
her reclaiming her power, or it’s the image of&nbsp;
her still shackled and trapped by her anguish.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:17.520
Either way, it’s the gun that helps her&nbsp;
perpetuate a cycle of worldly violence.&nbsp;

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:21.440
The next morning, Thana coldly washes the blood&nbsp;
away from her hands before hearing Mrs. Nasone's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:25.920
dog barking rapidly. Annoyed, Thana comes&nbsp;
up with a solution for the dog's barking.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:29.360
She grinds some of the burglar's meat from the&nbsp;
fridge before giving it to Mrs. Nasone as she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:34.160
listens to the news of last night's killspree. A&nbsp;
few hours later, Thana heads out, and she disposes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:38.560
of some of the burglar's body parts again on her&nbsp;
way to the factory. In his office, Albert scolds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:42.560
Thana for not returning to work the previous day,&nbsp;
which worried him and the rest of her co-workers.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:46.160
Thana sheepishly listens to Albert's tirades,&nbsp;
and he's disappointed that she isn't even going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:50.560
to the Halloween party. But Thana cuts him off,&nbsp;
writing a note saying that she wants to go.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:54.320
Amused, Albert invites Thana to the party&nbsp;
as his partner, and Thana coldly accepts.&nbsp;

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:58.960
Shortly after, Albert and Thana join the rest of&nbsp;
their co-workers as they watch Laurie hook up with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:03.440
a man. The group laughs at the sight, amused&nbsp;
by Laurie's intensity, while Albert and Thana&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:07.680
share seductive looks. Later that night, Thana&nbsp;
goes around the city again in search of her next&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:12.160
victims. While waiting inside a phone booth, Thana&nbsp;
spots a man making out with his girlfriend before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:16.880
he leaves for home. Thana follows the man to his&nbsp;
apartment and prepares to shoot him. However, the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:21.600
man enters his home, leaving a disappointed Thana&nbsp;
outside. The more Thana unravels, the more evident&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:25.520
it is that she’s no longer doing this for justice.&nbsp;
Her crusade against the men of Manhattan has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:29.680
turned into a crusade of contempt and vengeance.&nbsp;
Perhaps her resentment has grown so strong that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:33.760
she started believing that all men are deserving&nbsp;
of death. Maybe she’s trying to keep the high of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:37.680
finally being the predator in a society that keeps&nbsp;
putting her on the lowest rung of the echelon. No&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:41.680
matter what Thana’s reasoning is, Thana’s just out&nbsp;
for blood now, and there’s barely a justification&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:46.320
for this. Still in search of a target, Thana&nbsp;
moves to a bar and sits beside a man there. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:50.080
blabbers on about his life with his wife and job&nbsp;
while Thana fakes interest in the man's stories.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:55.520
Soon, they sit on a nearby bench outside the bar.&nbsp;
With a lost look in his eyes, the man recounts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:59.680
almost robotically how he caught his wife with&nbsp;
another woman. He talks about brushing his teeth,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:04.160
changing his clothes, and finally, he talks about&nbsp;
strangling his wife's cat. Upon hearing this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:08.320
wide-eyed Thana slowly raises her gun towards&nbsp;
the man, but he quickly takes the gun from her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:12.400
He asks her if she's joking before cocking the&nbsp;
weapon and aiming it at his head. The two share&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:15.920
some intense seconds of silence, just staring&nbsp;
at each other until the man eventually shoots&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:20.800
himself dead. In a panic, Thana quickly rushes&nbsp;
home. Though the man and Thana have completely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:25.040
incomparable experiences and baggage, they’re&nbsp;
both hurt and listless people. His wife’s cat&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:28.720
was innocent, but he still chose to strangle it,&nbsp;
presumably to hurt his wife because he couldn’t&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:33.680
hurt her directly. Or he strangled it to let&nbsp;
his pain and anguish be known. Or, even simpler,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:37.600
he strangled the cat because he had all those&nbsp;
emotions festering in him with no other outlet.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:40.800
No matter what his reason was, he&nbsp;
wasn’t all that different from Thana.&nbsp;

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:44.800
The next morning, Thana is walking along the&nbsp;
stairs when Mrs. Nasone's dog growls at her after&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:49.520
sensing her presence. But Thana shrugs it off&nbsp;
and ignores the dog to head inside her apartment.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:53.120
There, she removes her disguise and fixes her&nbsp;
apartment up before placing the last of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:57.440
burglar's body parts into a bag for disposal.&nbsp;
Thana then leaves through the fire exit before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:02.080
Mrs. Nasone suddenly enters the apartment with&nbsp;
her dog. The dog sniffs around, standing by a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:06.880
locked door and making Mrs. Nasone run out to get&nbsp;
the keys. However, Mrs. Nasone's dog accidentally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:10.640
bumps into a drawer, causing one of Thana's&nbsp;
vases to fall to the ground. Hearing this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:14.880
Mrs. Nasone quickly returns to Thana's apartment&nbsp;
and fixes her dog's mess before leaving.&nbsp;

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:18.880
Meanwhile, in the garment factory, Albert rewards&nbsp;
the workers by giving them the afternoon off to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:22.800
prepare for their Halloween party that night.&nbsp;
Later that day, Thana returns home and asks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:27.520
Mrs. Nasone if she could walk her dog. With Mrs.&nbsp;
Nasone's reluctant blessing, Thana heads out to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:32.000
try and get rid of it. She tries getting the&nbsp;
dog run over by some cars to no avail. Then,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.880
she heads to a nearby port, where she ties the&nbsp;
dog by a pole. She proceeds to aim her gun at it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:40.800
Back in the apartment, she leaves a letter for&nbsp;
Mrs. Nasone, telling her that her dog ran away,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:44.880
before preparing for the party. Though it&nbsp;
isn’t made clear if Thana shot the dog or not,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:48.400
it’s apparent that her increasingly flippant&nbsp;
attitude towards murder has extended beyond&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:52.560
victimizing men of varying innocence. By&nbsp;
pointing her gun at the dog, it’s as if Thana is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:56.160
starting to use her weapon as the answer to the&nbsp;
hurdles and inconveniences she’s experiencing.&nbsp;

00:10:56.720 --> 00:11:01.280
After putting on her nun costume, Thana loads&nbsp;
her gun, and she kisses the bullets one by one.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:05.920
She then stands in front of a mirror, pretending&nbsp;
to shoot. Night comes, and Thana and Albert arrive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:09.440
at the party together before making their&nbsp;
way to their co-workers. Albert mingles&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:12.320
around with the people at the party, and&nbsp;
he keeps telling them about his partner,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:16.880
Thana. With the crowd dancing to the lively&nbsp;
music, Albert and Thana sneak into a nearby room.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:21.200
There, Albert gently kisses parts of&nbsp;
Thana's body, down to her leg and foot.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:25.440
When he lifts her skirt, Albert is shocked to&nbsp;
find a gun hidden near her thigh. The jig is up,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:29.600
and Thana shoots Albert, alarming the whole&nbsp;
party. In an anticlimactic turn of events,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:33.360
Thana’s most glaring victim is not her first&nbsp;
assailant. It’s not even a man who’s been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:38.160
going around violating women and enacting violence&nbsp;
upon their unwilling bodies. It’s just her boss,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:41.600
a painfully plain man whose misgivings are&nbsp;
berating his employees and constantly trying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:45.840
to get with Thana. And though Thana’s clearly not&nbsp;
in any sound state of mind, this can be her own&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:50.080
way of fighting against the daily transgressions&nbsp;
she’s been put through. After all, harm isn’t&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:54.480
always something grotesque and macabre; the harm&nbsp;
most people face is more sinister and nebulous.&nbsp;

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:58.240
Some of the men try to check the two, but Thana&nbsp;
unflinchingly shoots them as she walks down some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:02.560
stairs. Once she's there, she carefully&nbsp;
shoots the men one by one in the crowd.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:06.560
Thana continues her violent burst without remorse,&nbsp;
targeting all the men there relentlessly before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:11.600
Laurie suddenly reacts. She grabs a nearby knife,&nbsp;
and with that, she stabs Thana in the back.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:15.920
As Thana screams in pain, she looks back in shock&nbsp;
to find Laurie there. Thana could only whisper&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:20.880
the word, ‘sister’ as she falls to her doom.
Meanwhile, in Thana's apartment, Mrs. Nasone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:25.440
returns and opens Thana's locked door. When she&nbsp;
walks inside the room, Mrs. Nasone carefully&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:29.040
sneaks around, searching for whatever Thana&nbsp;
is hiding before taking one of the bags there.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:34.080
Suddenly, the door creaks, alarming Mrs. Nasone.&nbsp;
She then calls out to the person outside,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:38.240
asking if it's Thana before her neighbor comes&nbsp;
inside, clad in a gorilla suit. This surprises&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:43.360
Mrs. Nasone, and the two eventually leave Thana's&nbsp;
place. When Mrs. Nasone returns to her apartment,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:47.760
she immediately opens Thana's bag and screams in&nbsp;
horror as she uncovers the burglar's severed head.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:51.520
In a rush, she frantically makes her call&nbsp;
to the police to tell them of Thana's crime.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:55.360
The police then give her a visit, and Mrs.&nbsp;
Nasone dramatically talks about how Thana must&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:59.280
have killed her beloved dog while her gorilla-suit&nbsp;
neighbor comforts her. When the police are gone,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:04.160
Mrs. Nasone is left alone in grief. However,&nbsp;
as Mrs. Nasone cries, her dog suddenly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:09.040
returns to their home, barking at the door.
After being violated by her two assailants, no man&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:13.280
has come close to harming Thana again. With her&nbsp;
pistol, she was practically untouchable, and it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:17.280
almost felt as if no man can ever take her down.&nbsp;
And that’s correct, because Thana’s undoing was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:21.840
brought by two women and herself. It was a cruel&nbsp;
and twisted irony, but with how Thana had fallen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:26.000
off any just and moral standing, it’s become a&nbsp;
comeuppance against her. Thana was the prey who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.640
turned into a hunter, not just against the vile,&nbsp;
but against anyone resembling the perceived evil.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:35.040
This only goes to show that the story is not meant&nbsp;
to empower; it’s not even about retribution. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:39.040
tale is about Thana’s unrelenting vengeance&nbsp;
and her perpetuating a cycle of violence.&nbsp;

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:43.120
With the .45 pistol that once belonged to the&nbsp;
burglar, it’s almost as if Thana is killing her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:47.280
victims in the burglar’s proxy. It’s the wretched&nbsp;
effect he had on Thana, seeping through her and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:51.600
damning every man around her. Though unapparent&nbsp;
at first glance, this is also a cautionary tale&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:54.880
about how one’s act of evil can affect even&nbsp;
those who they never came into contact with.
