00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.000
Welcome to Slash Forward. In this episode&nbsp;
we’re going to keep things simple and,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.200
perhaps, intimate as we look at a little indie&nbsp;
film with only six characters and one primary&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:22.160
location. It’s a straightforward film about&nbsp;
a couple who kidnaps another couple and get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.560
themselves stranded in a service station&nbsp;
while attempting to avoid a predatory mold&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.680
that absorbs our nutrients and takes over and&nbsp;
reforms biological material. Of course you must&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.320
realize I’m describing the 2008 creature&nbsp;
feature Splinter. How could you survive an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.040
attack from a semi-sentient fungus that can take&nbsp;
you over slowly from a single prick, or through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.160
directly attacking you as amalgamation of various&nbsp;
parts and pieces that used to be your friends.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.560
We’re about to go on a journey with a quartet of&nbsp;
fine people who are forced to struggle with just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.400
that question. Let me know if you’ve seen this one&nbsp;
and what you thought in the comments below. And if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.400
you like any part of this video, hitting the like&nbsp;
button would help me out a lot. Let’s get to it.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.080
We open at a Sherman service&nbsp;
station somewhere out in BFE.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.480
The clerk’s having a lazy afternoon and&nbsp;
settles into his lawn chair for some relaxin,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.880
which is hard to do with your back to the&nbsp;
wilderness. A noise attracts his attention,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:16.800
but he’s no fool - he approaches cautiously, but&nbsp;
gets his lower extremities shredded nonetheless.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.680
As he suffers we get little bits of a driving&nbsp;
scene where we can almost make out what’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.840
happening, before the sports ute enters the&nbsp;
perimeter of one of those old experimental&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.240
extraction sites owned by the oil companies.&nbsp;
While I’m sure this was marked on the map,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.640
they still pull about twenty feet off of&nbsp;
a nearby service road to post up for (what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.480
basically equates to camping in their backyard)&nbsp;
some bunny hill camping. After giving Seth wood,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:43.120
he and Polly almost immediately get&nbsp;
to rolling around in the wild grasses.

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.600
Meanwhile, Dennis and his girl Lacey find&nbsp;
their engine destroyed while on their way to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.160
Mexico. Determined to salvage the weekend,&nbsp;
Dennis insists they get out and walk it.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.800
At the campsite the tent almost makes Seth&nbsp;
give in and head out to the nearest motel. But&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:02.240
it is their anniversary and Polly desires to&nbsp;
make love in the moonlight. So they soldier on,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.880
but end up destroying their only tent,&nbsp;
which now severely limits their options.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.040
Not a man to travel heavy, D chucks their&nbsp;
belongings into the woods so they can move&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.360
swiftly. Lacey is upset with this turn of events,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.280
but D wins her over with some classic&nbsp;
little pet names. Always the gentleman,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.760
he even makes sure she’s nice and warm,&nbsp;
even though his shirt is fully saturated.

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.720
On their way back to civilization, Seth hits his&nbsp;
lady with some anniversary fun facts about nature&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.920
But do you know if they’re known for harboring&nbsp;
an ancient evil? As they head down the old dusty&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.640
trail, and make jokes about the gnarly and sticky&nbsp;
motel room that is likely in store for them, they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.680
run past Lacey and decide to stop. Unfortunately,&nbsp;
she was honey potting the young couple and as a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.160
result of their indecision, D is able to sneak&nbsp;
up on them and take control of the vehicle.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.800
While they initially needed a ride, D also&nbsp;
reveals the amended plan is to hold them until&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.280
the banks open in the morning so they can get some&nbsp;
spending cash before heading to their destination.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.320
As they settle into the situation, Lacey is&nbsp;
stricken by a bout of unseasonable shivers.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:07.040
As D tosses the phones and searches their&nbsp;
wallets, we find out that Seth is a PhD&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.680
student. When Lacey perks up and inquires if&nbsp;
he has yet been entrusted with writing scripts,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:17.920
her affliction comes into focus. Unfortunately&nbsp;
for, well, everybody really, Seth is a biologist.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.520
They travel into the night, but have to stop&nbsp;
after hitting something in the road. Then they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.920
file out to change the flat while the truck&nbsp;
takes a relaxing piss all over the asphalt.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.320
Lacey thought the animal looked like her dead&nbsp;
pet Ginger. Despite the low likelihood of this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:34.400
scenario, she goes back to check it out.&nbsp;
Distraught, she attempts to compel Seth to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:40.160
use his biology PhD to help her despite the fact&nbsp;
that Ginger is now just a wet spot on the road.

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.800
Back at the truck D gets a&nbsp;
wicked splinter in his finger,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.840
but he’s a hard man so he just&nbsp;
pulls it out and keeps rolling.

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.480
With limited options available to him, Seth&nbsp;
resorts to wishing Ginger alive and sure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.920
enough her remains become agitated. When they get&nbsp;
snapped at, Lacey fires on the cat flap and runs.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.320
In the confusion they all pile into the car and&nbsp;
drive at Lacey’s insistence. When they reach a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:05.120
safe distance she explains what happened, but D&nbsp;
reassures her that Ginger is dead and suggests&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:10.080
that this may be a byproduct of her coming down&nbsp;
off the red dragon, if you know what I’m saying.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:14.800
As he continues to reassure her, the engine&nbsp;
temperature rises, risking a warped head. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:19.600
they pull off at a nearby service station that’s&nbsp;
familiar to us. Lacey heads to the bathroom and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:24.480
D has Seth fuel up - after reminding him who&nbsp;
the big man is. Then he and Polly go inside to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:29.280
get some coolant. They find it to be strangely&nbsp;
quiet as everyone goes about their business. D&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:34.000
attempts to check out, but can’t raise the clerk.&nbsp;
But Lacey finds him in the bathroom, begging for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:41.280
death. She runs up front to warn everyone of the&nbsp;
danger, and luckily she’s an expert communicator.

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:46.320
She’s vindicated, however, when a man with spikes&nbsp;
comes around the corner and menaces them in short,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:51.600
wonky movements. Despite her early adoption of&nbsp;
the danger aesthetic, Lacey gets spiked up while&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:56.240
Seth and the others lock themselves inside.&nbsp;
D takes a moment to mourn for his lost love,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.560
but also reminds them that they’re still&nbsp;
kidnapped. Things settle down after a few minutes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:05.760
so D snaps back into action - stocking up on phone&nbsp;
cord, cigarettes and cash. When he goes to erase&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:11.360
some evidence, he notices Lacey moving outside.&nbsp;
But with only 15 pixels demonstrating this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.200
he feels the need to venture out and&nbsp;
confirm it. As he prepares to do so,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:19.600
he makes Seth and Polly pinky promise that&nbsp;
they won’t leverage this to their advantage.

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:24.480
He proceeds with extreme caution, staying&nbsp;
low just in case there’s a sniper nearby.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:28.960
The spines tingle upon the approach of fresh&nbsp;
meat, and he drags her back to the station,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:32.560
face down of course. When things&nbsp;
start happening, Polly locks the door.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.400
Cowardly Seth, however, doesn’t want to&nbsp;
stir the pot, and the end result has them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:40.640
locked back in the store with a new friend&nbsp;
in the form of Lacey’s disembodied hand.

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:45.120
Seth is interested in its biology, but&nbsp;
D treats it like a giant spider. But&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:49.040
Seth’s boundless curiosity gets the best&nbsp;
of him and he studies it further - watching&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:54.080
as it absorbs nutrients from nearby fluids&nbsp;
like some sort of mold or fungus. The hand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:59.440
eventually stops, but the rest of Lacey’s body&nbsp;
is famished and it thirsts for their fluids.

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:03.360
They attempt to escape out the back door, but&nbsp;
don’t have a key. Seth goes back up front to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:07.840
search for one, but is coming up empty when&nbsp;
D suggests they pop the hinges. So Seth comes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:12.880
back with a screwdriver and they begin to remove&nbsp;
the door as D recounts all of his now irrelevant&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:17.600
hopes and dreams. Unfortunately, a second&nbsp;
layer of security confounds their efforts.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:21.760
Curiously, the banging stops, and they hear&nbsp;
the creature shuffling around on the roof.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:25.440
It’s then discovered that this was caused&nbsp;
by the arrival of the local Sheriff.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:30.960
They try really hard to convince her to call for&nbsp;
backup, but to also be careful and do so from the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:40.720
safety of her vehicle. They eventually reach&nbsp;
a compromise Well, that’s something, I guess.

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:45.200
As she raises HQ on her radio, she gets some&nbsp;
splinters dropped on her grill before being&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:49.840
descended upon and ripped in half. At this point,&nbsp;
even grizzled Dennis chucks his lunch in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:55.440
corner. Afterward, they all take a moment to fall&nbsp;
into an infinitely deep pit of despair. Meanwhile,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:55.440 --> 00:07:01.360
topside, the creature reconstitutes the officer’s&nbsp;
torso to configure itself into version 2.0.

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:06.240
During the next lull, we’re reminded of D’s&nbsp;
dirty little secret as Polly and Seth argue&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:10.480
over whether they should make for the cruiser&nbsp;
or trust that help is now on the way. Then,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:15.280
a third option - they can create a trail of&nbsp;
flammable liquid from the back door to the forest,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:17.280
light it on fire and wait for the firemen to come&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:21.840
rescue them with their barrel chests&nbsp;
and burly arms. Seth is not on board,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:25.680
but in the absence of viable options they tell&nbsp;
him to take a breather while they get to work.

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:29.600
But then they hear the crackle of Sheriff&nbsp;
Frankel’s radio and see that it’s just outside&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:33.920
the exterior pay station. Seth immediately&nbsp;
fashions a device to try to hook it in.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:38.400
D attempts to help him add to it, reminding&nbsp;
us of the creeping dread consuming his hand.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:43.680
Seth fiddles a bit, but eventually snags the cord&nbsp;
and slowly draws it in and juuuust over the edge.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:48.480
But the creature drops in to dispute ownership&nbsp;
since it is comprised of the Sheriff’s torso.

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:53.040
It attempts to get in but can do little more&nbsp;
than bleed all over the floor with it’s weak,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:57.760
squishy human parts. However, this does&nbsp;
present as an enticing snack for several&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:02.240
pieces now inside the building. After they&nbsp;
repel it, Seth and Polly realize suddenly that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:07.520
there is a conspicuous absence of D. But they’re&nbsp;
distracted from this by another autonomous hand,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:11.920
which they manage to hold off because, really,&nbsp;
it shouldn’t be that strong to begin with.

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:16.400
D then pops out from behind the OJ to warn&nbsp;
them to avoid splinters and invite them into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:20.880
his sweet cooler clubhouse. Once inside,&nbsp;
the hand just sort of forgets about them.

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:26.000
As they reconvene, the moment is punctuated&nbsp;
by his affliction completely ravaging his arm.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.560
Noooowwww he decides it’s an appropriate time&nbsp;
to try to stop the spread. He calls for a knife,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:34.960
but then passes out. But it’s all good,&nbsp;
because Seth finally steps up to do him a solid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:41.360
fairplay. But with only a boxcutter surely&nbsp;
the bone will pose a - oh, well, okay then.

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:46.000
When he wakes up he is forced to give Seth his&nbsp;
props for lopping off his traitorous appendage.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:51.040
Now feeling high after the adrenal dump, he&nbsp;
opens up a bit to share some of his motivations.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:54.720
He wasn’t actually going to Mexico. He&nbsp;
was trying to get back to his nest egg&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:58.960
to gift it to the widow of the man he&nbsp;
killed in a robbery that went sideways.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:01.680
Saddled with medical bills, she&nbsp;
eventually went bankrupt and he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:04.960
had been trying to help support her while&nbsp;
he did his stretch in the penitentiary.

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:09.600
The introspective mood leads Seth to a&nbsp;
hypothesis that temperature may be a factor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:13.200
in this situation. He needs to check something&nbsp;
first, though, so they all creep out of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:18.240
safety of the cooler to corner themselves behind&nbsp;
the counter. Upon review of the security tape Seth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:23.280
posits that this simple organism just wanders&nbsp;
around, following the warmest object nearby&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:26.960
hoping that it’s food. It didn’t come for&nbsp;
him at first, because he was protected by the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:31.280
heat of the engine. If they can stay below the&nbsp;
ambient temperature they would be invisible to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:36.720
the creature. Since a hypothesis means nothing&nbsp;
without proper experimentation to back it up,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:40.080
he goes into a zenlike state and&nbsp;
attempts to induce hypothermia.

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:44.560
Since the outside temp is 92 degrees, he&nbsp;
waits until he drops sufficiently below&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:48.720
that to give him some time to get to the&nbsp;
car. The others toss some hot-ass fireworks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:52.960
out the back door for a distraction and,&nbsp;
once the creature shows up, Seth staggers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:57.760
out the front hoping he can get there without&nbsp;
warming up too much. But, ya boi is struggling.

00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:02.240
Bad news when they set off a fresh one and the&nbsp;
splinter monster seems disinterested. Because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:06.960
when Seth gets to the car there are no keys,&nbsp;
the radio is off, and he can’t help but to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:12.000
hot - attracting the monster’s attention. D tries&nbsp;
to regain control by throwing a firework into the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.400
front lot, but the creature is not attracted to&nbsp;
the hottest thing around anymore and it bursts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:20.800
into the store with them. Despite it being&nbsp;
a fair 2v2, they duck back into the cooler.

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:24.960
Seth tries to unlock a shotgun, nearly blowing&nbsp;
his face off, and then we’re reminded that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:28.800
there was a puddle of lighter fluid out&nbsp;
back. As the building goes up in flames,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:32.720
Seth tries to distract it and they recognize&nbsp;
that they have to get it into the fire.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:37.200
Seeking redemption Dennis gets up close and&nbsp;
personal, firing some shots and taking some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:42.480
splinters before blasting the diesel into a&nbsp;
cleansing fireball. Seth and Polly return to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:46.240
him. However, recognizing that he’s done&nbsp;
for, he turns over the widow’s address&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:50.960
and instructions for accessing his cache&nbsp;
of cash. Then they walk off as he ensures&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:55.600
there is nothing left behind. As Seth and Polly&nbsp;
wander toward the horizon, comforted in leaving&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:55.600 --> 00:11:01.200
the danger behind them, we see that the danger is&nbsp;
simply awaiting a new host upon whom it can feed.

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:05.280
Much like in the movie itself, Splinter -&nbsp;
the movie itself - started small and seems&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:08.640
to have built up a loyal following over time. Any&nbsp;
acclaim is well deserved. It has a very sharp and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:13.280
effective narrative wrapped up in a sort of a&nbsp;
little baby movie at just over eighty minutes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:17.760
long. But they spent the money in the right&nbsp;
places, utilizing mostly practical effects and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:22.800
using them sparingly, but with intensity. Taking&nbsp;
an excellent creature design and incorporating&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:26.800
it into a simple set up that focuses on&nbsp;
tension and character development is a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:31.760
winning combination. This is essentially the same&nbsp;
recipe that was later used for Attack the Block,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:36.000
another good example that puts these principles to&nbsp;
work. I’d love to hear your thoughts on the movie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.160
in the comments below. Did you catch this one, or&nbsp;
did it fly under your radar? If you can find it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:44.880
the short time commitment makes it an easy watch&nbsp;
even if you’re not sure it’s your type of thing.

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:55.840
Before we go, I’d like to give a huge thanks to&nbsp;
my donors, memorialized in the hall of headshots.

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:04.640
I have a website set up where you can&nbsp;
support the channel through donations or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:09.280
merch. Any donation unlocks uncensored movie&nbsp;
reviews of Lifeforce and Under the Skin,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:12.400
with others to be added over&nbsp;
time. If you enjoyed the video,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:17.600
I’d love for you to become a part of the&nbsp;
channel by subscribing. Thanks for watching.
