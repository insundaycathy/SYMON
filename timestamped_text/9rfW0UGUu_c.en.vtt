they're trying to do is obviously make
 

00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:15.590 align:start position:0%
they're trying to do is obviously make
you<00:22:14.309><c> think</c><00:22:14.670><c> that</c><00:22:14.730><c> it's</c><00:22:14.820><c> a</c><00:22:14.970><c> body</c><00:22:15.179><c> but</c><00:22:15.480><c> it's</c>

you think that it's a body but it's
 

00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:17.360 align:start position:0%
you think that it's a body but it's
pretty<00:22:15.929><c> clear</c><00:22:16.410><c> that</c><00:22:16.440><c> it</c><00:22:17.100><c> wouldn't</c><00:22:17.280><c> be</c>

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:17.370 align:start position:0%
pretty clear that it wouldn't be
 

00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:19.430 align:start position:0%
pretty clear that it wouldn't be
revealed<00:22:17.640><c> that</c><00:22:17.820><c> way</c><00:22:17.970><c> that</c><00:22:18.150><c> quickly</c><00:22:18.360><c> no</c><00:22:18.809><c> way</c><00:22:19.020><c> no</c>

00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
revealed that way that quickly no way no
