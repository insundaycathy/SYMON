00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:09.700
Welcome to Slash Forward.

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:13.830
In this episode we’re going to dive into
a philosophical meditation on the dangers

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.810
of allowing our political landscape to develop
into a three party system.

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.489
In this case, under the context of that third
party determining that there were insufficient

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:26.960
resources to provide the level of care necessary
for a functional society.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:32.180
Given this, and under the guise that purging
one’s deep-seated emotional turmoil is a

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.360
necessary aspect of human nature, the concept
of the purge was born.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.080
But, is it helpful, and is it actually healthy?

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.280
In order to look forward we first have to
go back - to the beginning - and see how it

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.290
all started with The First Purge.

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:51.290
In the process of parsing this information,
please don’t let me prevent you from hitting

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:56.309
the like button if you see or hear something
you like, nor from leaving a comment identifying

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.199
your favorite film from the purge series.

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.690
Let’s get to it.

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.960
We open on an interview with a colorful gentleman
who openly acknowledges his need for the pipe.

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.090
If he doesn’t get it, he becomes unrepentantly
violent.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.420
While some may struggle with this aspect of
their personality, Skeletor recognizes this

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:19.369
as just a part of who he is - he has to purge

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:24.830
We then listen in on a newsreel that describes,
essentially, the world as it is right now.

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.619
Widespread unrest has led to the emergence
of a dreaded third political party, this one

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:31.460
named the New Founding Fathers.

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.609
This group has, through promises of revitalization,
managed to rise to power.

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:41.469
We then transition to Staten Island, somewhere
in New England, where we meet Dmitri - the

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:46.170
neighborhood boss getting in his cardio while
learning about this new purge situation, which

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.340
is to be tested for the first time in Staten
Island.

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.670
We also meet Nya and Isaiah, doing the best
they can with what they have and trying to

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.359
ignore the upcoming event that looms over
them, like a leaky pipe about to burst, perhaps?

00:01:59.359 --> 00:02:04.789
We’re then invited into another confidential
interview where we learn the NFFA, the governing

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:10.820
body overseeing this experiment, is paying
residents to stay on the island.

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:16.830
In addition, they’re offering monetary bonuses
for engaging in and instigating purge activities.

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.200
As the news reports on the growing anticipation,
most of the normies are working to get off

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.200
the island.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.599
Amidst the protests against this barbaric
experiment, the NFFA Chief of Staff confirms

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:31.720
that this is a vetted and voted upon project,
so it’s legit.

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:37.780
Dr. Updale, the project’s conceiver, also
confirms that it is apolitical, it’s purpose

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.159
is therapeutic and should help to heal the
growing rifts in our society.

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:47.250
Dmitri then descends from his ivory tower
to take in the ambiance, pay tribute to who

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.110
he calls the three kings of the neighborhood
and confide in Nya that, despite being an

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.940
unsavory fellow, he’s not into this type
of unbridled destruction.

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:01.739
On a nearby corner we see Isaiah training
up for his new job - to the disapproving clucks

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:03.000
of the old-timers.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.970
He gets his first test from Skelator, who
tries to convince him that it’s customary

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.620
for new slangers to hook up their good customers
with a free sample.

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:16.470
Isaiah’s response is not customer-service
oriented so Skelly sprays him with COVID before

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.450
slicing his neck and running off.

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.480
We then transition to Dmitri, holding a town
hall for his employees where he encourages

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.640
them to lay low and avoid getting hurt.

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.579
The goal here is to prevent profit loss or
creating an opportunistic opening for their

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:30.579
enemies.

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:34.390
They’ve deemed it too risky to try to move
the stuff or the money off the island.

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.160
After a little bit of power checking, they’re
feeling pretty confident that they have everything

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.890
squared away with limited likelihood that
they’ll ultimately reap what they sow.

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.129
When we see Isaiah again, he’s addressing
his fresh neck wound.

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:50.610
However, he didn’t do enough to stem the
flow before laying down a scarlet trail for

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:51.810
Nya to follow.

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.140
She is disheartened to learn he’s been running
the streets for D. As we transition over to

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.859
the local sports clubs where the boys are
getting in a few last hoops before the murder

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:05.719
sprees start up, we discover that D is also
an active coach and mentor to many young men.

00:04:05.719 --> 00:04:10.920
Nya busts in and expresses her dissatisfaction
in Isaiah’s career aspirations, which Dmitri

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.829
claims to be ignorant of, but he vows to balance
the scales of justice here.

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:20.870
Recognizing this as code for violent retribution,
Nya admonishes her former lover for the man

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:21.870
he’s become.

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.620
Still thirsty for that filthy lucca, Isaiah
takes his first free moment to visit a purge

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:31.090
trailer where he receives his complimentary
flower and recording lenses.

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.940
An hour before the purge starts, we see that
not everyone who wanted to leave was able

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:39.590
to do so, while others seem perfectly happy
to just be right in the middle of it all.

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:43.860
Meanwhile, those who agreed to stay for the
money, but had no intention of participating

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.060
find comfort and safety in numbers.

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:50.370
Nya finishes checking in some of the refugees
before circling back with Isaiah who lies

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:51.710
about being in Brooklyn.

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:56.650
Instead, he pops in his new contacts, which
would only work if you don’t already wear

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:59.370
contacts, and then hits the streets to find
Skeletor.

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.560
As the sun goes down, everyone settles in
for the festivities.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:07.400
After some well-wishes from our overlords,
the official warning announcement is broadcast.

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:12.210
As the siren blares, Isaiah emerges into the
night air where some folks are already reveling

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:13.639
in the party atmosphere.

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:18.250
Elsewhere, Skeletor takes a moment to admire
his murderous preparations, and we learn that

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:23.020
social mores were, apparently, the only thing
keeping him as close to within the lines as

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:24.020
he had been.

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:28.060
Eager to get that money, he hits the streets
and manages to draw first blood.

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:32.240
This is confirmed at the command post where
an air of titillation runs through the crowd.

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:36.639
Dmitri checks in with his business partners
and former lovers.

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:41.069
But Nya is tied up at the church in her own
mini-purge when she finds Dolores ransacked

00:05:41.069 --> 00:05:44.230
the pastor’s office to dip into his private
stash.

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:49.240
Out in town Isaiah proceeds through an alley
where he wonders if he may be a sheep among

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:50.240
wolves.

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:54.389
He then turns a corner where he finds those
two ladies had, apparently, raided the local

00:05:54.389 --> 00:05:57.449
radio shack in order to fashion some remote
detonators.

00:05:57.449 --> 00:06:00.819
He makes it through the gauntlet and comes
out in the business square where the town

00:06:00.819 --> 00:06:04.129
proprietors try in vain to protect their storefronts.

00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:08.819
He then runs across a group of school chums
who convince him to join them at a purge party

00:06:08.819 --> 00:06:12.770
where they intend to leave this nastiness
behind them and just dance.

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:17.280
This is bad news at the command post, where
they observe parties unfolding all over town.

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:22.289
I mean, how will the people heal their broken,
individual psyches if they don’t engage

00:06:22.289 --> 00:06:24.110
in collective acts of violence?

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:27.979
This moment is interrupted, however, when
news of the first murder of the evening begins

00:06:27.979 --> 00:06:29.970
to disseminate to various groups.

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:33.470
Isaiah takes this as his cue to head out to
find his target.

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:38.229
But his target has arrived and he is delighted
at the opportunities before him.

00:06:38.229 --> 00:06:42.500
Back at Dmitri’s penthouse, his assistant
delivers him some ready and willing ladies,

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:45.599
who immediately begin to put on a show for
daddy.

00:06:45.599 --> 00:06:50.960
After some concurrent grinding at both locations,
everyone starts to get aggressively stabby.

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:55.960
The two femme fatales employ their best moves
while the part goers discover how disruptive

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:58.360
murder is toward experiencing joy.

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:04.789
Once neutralized, the ladies immediately rat
out their employer.

00:07:04.789 --> 00:07:08.820
Updale considers this a fairly good starting
point, even though the news reports out that

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:10.270
it’s generally quiet out there.

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:14.210
Isaiah contributes to the quietude when he
struggles to do the one thing he set out to

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:18.380
accomplish that evening, and finds himself
scurrying around looking for a dangerous place

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:19.380
to hide.

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:24.220
Despite the open legality of everything, the
crackheads are still enjoying their drugs

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:27.840
underground, and do not appreciate the intrusion.

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:32.300
Recognizing he’s now in too deep, Isaiah
finds a quiet spot and comes clean to Nya,

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:34.060
dragging her out into the open.

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:38.960
She suffers the misfortune of running across
a baby-faced crotch-grabber who, we presume,

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:42.970
has been waiting under a grate all night,
hoping an attractive woman would come check

00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:44.379
out this one dumpster?

00:07:44.379 --> 00:07:49.319
So anyway, she arrives at the spot and waits
outside for Isaiah to come out, the perfect

00:07:49.319 --> 00:07:50.319
plan!

00:07:50.319 --> 00:07:55.069
He removes his contacts to avoid detection
and then emerges just in time to stab Skeletor

00:07:55.069 --> 00:07:57.449
in the back with a large shard of glass.

00:07:57.449 --> 00:08:02.069
Elsewhere, Capital A rolls up to the ladies
and, in his celebratory mood, basically admits

00:08:02.069 --> 00:08:06.530
to everything out loud, thinking this is now
his time to wear the crown.

00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:14.500
This prompts D to spring his trap where we
also learn he has an unusual talent to help

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:18.909
carry him through - then some purgin’ happens.

00:08:18.909 --> 00:08:22.240
While it feels like things are ramping up,
we learn at the command post that there is

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:28.259
some anxiety around the relatively low levels
of participation in comparison to expectations.

00:08:28.259 --> 00:08:32.360
Nya and Isaiah are heading back toward the
church and discussing the best pathway toward

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:33.930
success and lifelong enrichment.

00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:38.430
They come to an agreement, but the good times
are ruined when a succubus pops out and puts

00:08:38.430 --> 00:08:39.780
them up against the wall.

00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:43.750
Luckily, he’s just a mischievous devil,
out to have some fun - the little stinker!

00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:48.829
But he’s followed by a true danger as a
gang of caucasoid dirt bikers roll through

00:08:48.829 --> 00:08:52.040
ahead of a very professional looking caravan.

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:56.710
This development is coincidentally expanded
upon when a news story notes an unexpected

00:08:56.710 --> 00:09:01.720
development in human behavioral research - a
high percentage of participants on the grounds

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:04.339
are wearing masks to hide their identity.

00:09:04.339 --> 00:09:08.220
On the way back to his penthouse, D is then
involved in a major car accident.

00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:10.790
He wakes up to a full on gun battle underway.

00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:14.990
He momentarily turns into John Wick before
calling in his location for some backup.

00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:20.090
When they arrive, it’s noted the dead gentlemen
have matching tattoos that indicate military

00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:22.660
background, and they are identified as mercenaries.

00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:27.990
Meanwhile Nya and Isaiah arrive at the church
just in time to see the end stage of a massacre

00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:28.990
underway.

00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:33.010
They find a couple of survivors, but nearby
gunfire prevents them from sticking around

00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:36.120
to find anyone else, so they go back to their
apartment.

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:40.079
At the command post, it’s noted that a slow
start with a sudden spike in violence is the

00:09:40.079 --> 00:09:42.010
inverse of expectations.

00:09:42.010 --> 00:09:46.630
Suspicious about the outcomes, since it couldn’t
be her hypothesis, Updale requests the camera

00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:50.640
tech backtrack the CCTV to ascertain where
the caravan originated.

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:55.870
It turns out a large number of vehicles came
spewing from a central garage location and

00:09:55.870 --> 00:10:00.390
then immediately converged on various, highly
populated areas around the city.

00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:04.720
When confronted with this info, Sabian comes
right out and admits that this was all an

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:09.519
attempt to cull the population to make it
easier to manage reasonable solutions to most

00:10:09.519 --> 00:10:10.910
of our social ills.

00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:16.279
Now, for the first time since grad school,
Updale reconsiders her pursuit of the social

00:10:16.279 --> 00:10:17.279
sciences.

00:10:17.279 --> 00:10:21.779
Back at the accident site, now with an earpiece
in hand, D and his group decide to track the

00:10:21.779 --> 00:10:25.209
mercs and use their talent for violence to
save the community.

00:10:25.209 --> 00:10:29.019
First they head back to the armory to pick
all their personal favorites before hitting

00:10:29.019 --> 00:10:31.350
the streets to mount a counterforce.

00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:36.290
As they do that, our survivors run the streets
with violence unfolding all around them, eventually

00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:37.690
arriving at their building.

00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:41.940
They just barely make it in unscathed, but
are home now, and there’s only two hours

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:43.690
of purging left.

00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:48.779
The state of things is almost overwhelming,
but then Dolores arrives to bring some levity

00:10:48.779 --> 00:10:50.160
in these trying times.

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:54.420
D’s team hears about some locals who are
pinned down and putting up a resistance.

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:57.510
We see it’s the three kings fighting off
a gang of klansmen.

00:10:57.510 --> 00:11:02.100
Unfortunately, they are out-equipped as they
run out of ammunition in succession, requiring

00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:04.040
them to transition to melee weapons.

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:08.230
But before the klan can make a move, some
smoke grenades fog up the joint and provide

00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:12.970
the perfect cover for the wrecking crew to
slip in unseen and just absolutely destroy

00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:14.050
their enemies.

00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:18.620
Unfortunately, there’s no time to celebrate
as the radio indicates that all units are

00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:20.589
now converging on Park Hill.

00:11:20.589 --> 00:11:25.880
They make it there quickly but, while planning,
a gang of drones takes out the whole group,

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:30.680
leaving Dmitri lonely while also confirming
he does not know how to die.

00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:35.019
As the militia moves into the building, Nya
encourages them to arm themselves, and D calls

00:11:35.019 --> 00:11:38.200
her to confirm that he’s going to make his
way up from behind them.

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:42.089
He approaches the first active floor, where
the team is already winning hallway battles

00:11:42.089 --> 00:11:43.779
and busting down doors.

00:11:43.779 --> 00:11:48.300
As a warmup, a couple of blokes happen into
the stairwell with D where he helps them recognize

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:50.820
the mistakes they’ve made in life that have
led them here.

00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:53.089
He then gets the idea to take out the lights.

00:11:53.089 --> 00:11:57.660
This turns the advantage in his favor, and
he is able to quietly take out an entire unit,

00:11:57.660 --> 00:12:01.910
other than the captain who then calls in for
a replenishment of manpower.

00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:05.970
Up ahead at the apartment, Nya comes up with
a plan for the attackers - use their five

00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:09.690
bullets to shoot low and then come in for
the kill once incapacitated.

00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:16.190
They wait for the inevitable, and it goes
off sans hitch, with Isaiah even showing he’s

00:12:16.190 --> 00:12:18.010
starting to get his stabbing legs under him.

00:12:18.010 --> 00:12:19.980
D then arrives to take out their backup.

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:23.639
Unfortunately, the reinforcements have shown
up.

00:12:23.639 --> 00:12:27.649
He scopes the corner with a mirror and lucks
out as, right when they’re about to let

00:12:27.649 --> 00:12:32.130
loose with a rocket, Skeletor arrives and
is disappointed to discover that the NFFA

00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:34.780
hired outside contractors to do his job.

00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:39.440
He files his complaint with the manager, giving
D time to toss out a C4 charge and shoot it,

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:42.620
roasting alive anyone who wasn’t already
dead.

00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:46.860
As the sun comes up outside, the sirens signalling
the end of Purge night sound off.

00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:55.090
The survivors of Park Hill emerge with a renewed
optimism and we’re left to assume that everything

00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:56.120
got better from there.

00:12:56.120 --> 00:13:01.390
It feels good to now fully know why we have
a purge and that it, at least, started from

00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:03.050
a place of good intentions.

00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:08.500
If only Dr. Updale’s pure and therapeutic
vision hadn’t been so twisted and bastardized

00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:13.390
by the dirty business of politics, imagine
how well-off our society would be now.

00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:17.380
In watching this one, I think it makes sense
that Purge activities seem to revolve around

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:19.120
murdering people you don’t like.

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:23.420
If you know people are going to be out murdering,
then the ultimate stakes for going out would

00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:24.709
be to wind up dead.

00:13:24.709 --> 00:13:29.220
So, why would you go out unless you really
had a murderous itch you needed to scratch?

00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:34.090
You’d think you’re going to have fun raiding
a candy store or scoring fifteen copies of

00:13:34.090 --> 00:13:36.750
Madden ‘21, only to wind up dead.

00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:40.480
Aside from that, the Purge series has had
political implications from the start.

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:44.810
But, I’m not sure that these themes were
provided additional depth by making it all

00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:48.860
tie back specifically to governmental attempts
at population control.

00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:52.630
That seems a bit more heavy handed than it
needed to be, but what did you think?

00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:55.300
The series box office went up with each successive
installment.

00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:58.040
Do you think it holds up well across the board?

00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:00.920
Let me know in the comments below, and if
you’ve seen the newest movie I’d love

00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:03.899
to hear how it rates in comparison to the
others.

00:14:03.899 --> 00:14:10.600
Before we go, I’d like to give a huge thanks
to my donors, memorialized in the hall of

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:13.889
headshots.

00:14:13.889 --> 00:14:23.970
I have a website set up where you can support
the channel through donations or merch.

00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:28.500
Any donation unlocks uncensored movie reviews
of Lifeforce and Under the Skin, with others

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:30.000
to be added over time.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.720
If you enjoyed the video, I’d love for you
to become a part of the channel by subscribing.

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:34.329
Thanks for watching.
