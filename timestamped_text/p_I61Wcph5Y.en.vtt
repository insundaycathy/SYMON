the mask she asks him who he is and he says he is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.960
like a family member after all these years he then&nbsp;
says her dad must be dead since she reached there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:35.440
she speculates that he must have done something to&nbsp;
be there he asks her if she has any moral values&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:41.920
or she is just like her dad she wants to know&nbsp;

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:47.840
steak on earth with potatoes and caesar salad&nbsp;

making up for 30 years that he has been captive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:58.800
there and a slice of key lime pie he also wants&nbsp;
to shave she threatens him that she can walk&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:04.320
away and let him rot there however he replies&nbsp;
that your conscience will not let you do it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:10.320
she gives him a razor from the shelf and&nbsp;
he asks to leave the lights on since her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:17.360
father used to give him light for only one hour&nbsp;
a day she then leaves she then goes back to home&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:22.400
she scans the prints and sends a voicemail&nbsp;
to their family friend detective emilio&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:28.880
sanchez asking him to run a check on it as soon as&nbsp;
possible after she gathers all the things the guy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:34.640
asked for she gets a call from scott she tells&nbsp;
him she is doing well and she needs some space&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:40.480
she then gives the guy all things he asked for&nbsp;
and he smells the steak then starts eating the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:46.880
food enjoying it with tears of joy she wants to&nbsp;
know about the truth but he starts laughing and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:53.440
she leaves she then comes back few hours later and&nbsp;
brings him a chocolate bar and a bottle of scotch&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:58.800
he gets emotional when he sees the chocolate bar&nbsp;
he says her dad would bring chocolate once a year&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:04.080
for him and give him one square piece of it and&nbsp;
he used to put the bar on shelf to taunt him along&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:10.000
with the pictures he took of him she then opens&nbsp;
the box and finds pictures of him from every year&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:16.320
he then introduces himself as morgan warner&nbsp;
and he grabs her hand then he apologizes by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:23.200
saying it's been long he had human contact he then&nbsp;
tells his story 30 years ago he met archer they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:29.440
had same taste of money gambling and women then&nbsp;
they became business partners he says one night&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:36.640
they had few drinks an archer was driving and they&nbsp;
ran over someone on road they killed a pedestrian&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:42.640
he wanted to call police but archer said if&nbsp;
there's no body there's no crime archer insisted&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:48.240
that they cover up the crime so archer buried it&nbsp;
but morgan was against it then archer attacked him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:54.320
and knocked him out and brought him to the bunker&nbsp;
he begged to kill him but archer didn't do it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:58.640
since he was afraid and he didn't let him&nbsp;
go as well that morgan will go to cops&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:05.280
then morgan claims archer has an affair with&nbsp;
a woman called sofia she is everything that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:10.560
catherine couldn't be lauren does not believe&nbsp;
so he gives her the address of her house&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:14.960
and asks her to check it by herself and also&nbsp;
to ask harold the family attorney about it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:21.840
since he knew about it as well lauren rages up&nbsp;
and she leaves she obviously cannot process all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:26.320
this and still calms herself down and she calls&nbsp;
the detective to check on the man morgan warner&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:30.480
meanwhile we can see morgan working&nbsp;
out and reading the newspaper&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:39.360
later shiraj to the address and asked to meet&nbsp;
sofia soon she meets sofia and she invites her in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:46.960
and she asks why she came there sofia tells her&nbsp;
that she met her father in a poker game she then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:53.040
looks at a picture and realizes her dad even&nbsp;
has a son with her at this point we can say that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:57.840
lauren is in shock again about the parallel&nbsp;
life her dad was living and she breaks down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:04.640
later she goes to harold and tells him that he&nbsp;
is a snake in the grass she mentions sofia but he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:10.320
says it's his job to keep secrets she asks to know&nbsp;
more secrets he says nothing that can harm you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:15.440
he then says there are things that he will hide&nbsp;
till he goes to grave and he asks her to walk&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:21.840
away later she meets her mom they all seem to be&nbsp;
preparing for the election campaign of william&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:27.920
she asks him about morgan warner but her mom&nbsp;
cannot recall anything then william shows up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:32.720
he says that he is losing some polls and wants&nbsp;
her to come to the rally since she is a famous&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:39.600
attorney who has an image of being good she agrees&nbsp;
she then goes to see morgan and she asks him why&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:45.440
he didn't mention the sun he says he wanted her&nbsp;
to suffer when she knows about it herself she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:49.680
asks him if he knows anything else he says he&nbsp;
knows everything since her father used to come&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:56.160
to him and confess everything that the bad husband&nbsp;
he was she asks him about the body of pedestrian&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:01.840
he says he does not know the direction but he&nbsp;
wants his freedom if he takes her there they agree&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:07.840
she then takes him outside he looks at&nbsp;
the sky and starts to laugh out of joy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:14.960
he says he even missed the scene of earth and he&nbsp;
thanks her scott calls her he asks her why she is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:21.040
ghosting him and their daughter she apologizes&nbsp;
and hangs up she then starts driving and he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:27.520
gives her the directions like offline maps&nbsp;
and they go to the exact path upon arrival&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:31.040
he walks a bit and takes her to the spot&nbsp;
and tells her the body is buried here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:37.520
she starts digging morgan starts smoking&nbsp;
after a while she comes across a human skull&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:42.160
her fears came true and she starts&nbsp;
hiding it again just like her father&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:48.960
then they leave she takes him to the bunker again&nbsp;
and asks him to put the collar back she now has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:54.080

mother he even didn't speak to her since 30 years&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:55.120 --> 00:10:00.400
she says she is not the one who is responsible&nbsp;
he says you can fix it she then says that she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:04.160
didn't volunteer for this he begs to her and&nbsp;
then he says you are just like your father&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:10.320
he promises that he won't say it to anyone&nbsp;
not even cops he will just vanish and spend&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:18.720
the remaining years of his life in peace she says&nbsp;
i'm sorry and she steps back and she leaves later&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:23.200
she calls the detective to find the information&nbsp;
of morgan warner but they don't have the file&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:28.880
there and it will take few days to get the hard&nbsp;
copy of the file the next day she goes to harold&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:33.600
aggressively he says stop asking questions you&nbsp;
don't want to hear answers to and asks her to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:39.600
walk away she then goes to william she asks him&nbsp;
for some advice she says it's for one of the cases&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:44.960
in court she asked him what he would have done if&nbsp;
a guy knew all the secrets and he is harmed to you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:49.440
he replies either dump his body in&nbsp;
the river or pay him off and walk away&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:56.320
later she goes back to bunker with a bag he asks&nbsp;
her to do the right thing she wants him to vanish&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:21.520
later we see morgan in his new look she asks&nbsp;
him what her dad told him about her he says&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:24.960
he was proud of her but he didn't like&nbsp;
that she is going after his rich friends&nbsp;&nbsp;

he says at least he didn't buy the union reps she&nbsp;
is surprised then she goes to william and she asks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:38.640
him if he paid off union reps he says there is&nbsp;
no evidence she is against the bribery he says&nbsp;&nbsp;

she starts putting all the stuff in trash&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:19.680
then we see detective sending the hard copy of&nbsp;
the file in which the fingerprint match was found&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:23.840
earlier when lauren took fingerprints&nbsp;
of morgan and sent it for verification&nbsp;&nbsp;
