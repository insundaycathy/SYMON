00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.240
The Ritual will give you another reason to
avoid hiking in a desolate forest away from

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.120
all the creature comforts you’re addicted
to.

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:14.500
In this video on Nerd Explains, I'll summarize
and explain The Ritual’s story and ending.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:19.520
If you need a breakdown of the monster, if
you want to know how to beat the monster,

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.160
or just want to see all the kills and monster
scenes, I'll have videos on all of these that

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.529
you can check out.

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.439
But this video’s all about explaining the
main events in The Ritual.

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:34.289
The Ritual starts off rather casually, with
a group of friends at a bar talking about

00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:35.760
vacation ideas.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.931
There’s mention of Tuscany to get drunk,
Ibiza to party, Amsterdam to get high, before

00:00:41.931 --> 00:00:48.070
landing on their soon-to-be most unforgettable
trip idea, hiking the Kings Trail in Sweden

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.210
where the Nordic gods are known for tormenting
mortal humans.

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.220
Luke and Robert then head to a liquor store
to pick up some Vodka where they run into

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:02.039
some junkies that end up killing Robert, after
he refused to give them his wedding ring.

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.600
Luke hides in the back of the store when all
this goes down, to be forever stricken with

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.520
survivors guilt from the incident, even though
there’s nothing he could have done, Luke

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.880
isn’t Michael Jai White.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:24.290
The thugs had knives and bats and would have
killed him too.

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.400
But that doesn’t ease his burden.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.590
Flash forward and Luke emerges from a tent
on the side of a mountain with his 4 friends,

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.259
minus Robert of course.

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:38.840
They decided to hike the trail in remembrance
of Robert.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.020
They break camp and finally make it to the
summit, where they honor their fallen friend

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:49.470
with some final words, swigs of booze from
a canteen, and a final libation, also known

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.920
as pouring one out for their dead homie, also
known as a ritual.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.750
They spend the night at the summit, where
the air is heavy with thoughts of Robert.

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:04.079
Hutch earnestly tells Luke that despite what
others may think, Rob’s death wasn’t Luke’s

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.299
fault, but this falls on unbelieving ears.

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:11.030
As they make their descent, Dom trips and
hurts his leg.

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.640
Hutch and Luke both scoff at how Dom is being
over dramatic about his injury.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.580
This causes the crew to search for a quicker
way off the mountain than was originally planned.

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:26.580
Hutch, the pathfinder of the group, sets them
on an uncharted, off-trail hike through a

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:27.580
forest.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.290
This little shortcut would theoretically cut
their journey in half, do ‘em some good,

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.760
and they’d be in a lodge with their feet
kicked up drinking some beers next to a warm

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:36.760
fire.

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.870
A real happily ever after fairy tale ending.

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.300
But there’s an hour and twenty minutes left
in this horror movie, so it’s safe to say

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.300
the shortcut won’t be doing them any good.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:53.320
Before too long, they walk past an eerie abandoned
van while cracking filthy jokes, while this

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.560
is one of the movie's earliest warning signs,
the mood is still light.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.910
It’s not until they stumble into an elk
strewn and hung from the trees with its intestines

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:08.000
gutted, freshly dripping blood that they realize
they may be in danger.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.819
Unfortunately for this group of friends, this
is what you might call, strong foreshadowing.

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:18.659
They wrongly mistake this for a deleted scene
from Planet Earth and venture on.

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:24.450
A thunderstorm erupts and forces them to find
shelter, and what better place to shelter

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.060
than an abandoned cabin in the woods.

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.170
Better than a tent I suppose.

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.880
While most of them unpack and settle in, Phil
goes to check out the attic for firewood.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:39.319
He does find some, but it’s stacked in the
quite unsettling shape of a headless torso

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:43.569
with antlers for arms, an effigy of sorts.

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:48.159
They decide to use other things for firewood
while discussing what the thing in their attic

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:52.080
is before getting the worst sleep of their
lives.

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:56.550
Luke wakes up to a nightmare where he’s
back in the convenience store, except it’s

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:58.659
foresty, it’s very trippy.

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:03.770
He walks up to grab the same bottle of vodka
he did when Robert was killed, then he gets

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:08.319
metaphysically hooved in the chest by something,
leaving a bloody wound.

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:12.939
His nightmare crashes back into reality when
the shelf of vodka seemingly gets ripped away

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:18.160
from him and disappears, with an invisible
monster running back into the forest.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:23.270
This wasn’t solely a hallucination, as the
bloody injury is still there when he wakes

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:24.440
up.

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:29.420
Luke returns to the cabin and finds Hutch
wetting his bed, Dom crying in the corner,

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:32.450
and Phil naked and praying to his Tinder date.

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:38.050
Now, it’s a bit unrealistic to assume it’s
a coincidence that all 4 of them had devastating

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:42.550
night terrors where 2 of them did some form
of sleepwalking.

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.160
Something is toying with them, testing them,
sizing them up.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.740
They leave the cabin in the morning to find
that the trees have symbols carved into them.

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.291
It’s not clear if those symbols were there
before the group walked into the cabin, but

00:04:55.291 --> 00:05:00.480
previously when look was shining his flashlight
out there at night we see possibly the same

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.360
trees that are untouched.

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.700
They figure the symbols are warnings.

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:10.700
These symbols are most likely Elder Futhark
runes from the 2nd to the 8th centuries.

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:17.240
The symbols translate roughly to the estate
of a giant dangerous elk who provides liberation

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.730
and new life from hardship.

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:24.930
At least that’s my interpretation from briefly
studying ancient runes on Wikipedia.

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:32.190
Dom, freaked out as he is, marches off on
a path to civilization, or so he thinks, despite

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:36.050
Hutch’s valid concerns that they have no
idea where it leads.

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:40.600
After some hours of getting nowhere, Luke
decides to run to the top of the ridge to

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:41.800
get a better view.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:47.480
He crests the hill only to see more of the
infinite forest, and one of the creepiest,

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:50.920
spine-shivering moments of his life so far.

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:55.080
Luke locks up when he sees something that
looks like a hand grasping a tree, but it

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:59.600
could just be part of the tree, until the
thing that looks like a hand moves.

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:03.030
He hightails it back to the group to tell
them what he saw.

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:08.040
Dom continues to lose his shit, dismissing
and denying that Luke actually saw anything

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:09.040
up there.

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:12.870
The tension between the two culminates when
Luke says that we wouldn’t be in this haunted

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:15.840
forest if Dom hadn’t screwed his knee.

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:20.560
Dom retaliates with a mic dropping bomb, saying
that we wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:26.520
for you, basically telling Luke that because
he was a coward and let his friend get killed,

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:31.130
they were hiking this mountain in his honor,
where they are now faced with an impending

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:32.130
doom.

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:35.680
Man, camping trips can really put a strain
on friendships.

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:40.200
Their internal feud is quickly overshadowed
by them stumbling across some fabric on the

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:41.200
ground.

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:45.860
They pull it out of the ground to realize
that it’s a tent, with boots, gear, a wallet

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:47.760
and credit card all abandoned.

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:53.210
The wallet contains a picture of a family,
and the credit card holder is Anna Eriksen,

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:55.750
expiring in 1984.

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:59.620
Given everything the crew has been through
up to this point, it’s hard to take this

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:03.470
as anything but a terrible sign of what might
happen to them.

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:08.530
Hutch continues to be the strongest leader
of the group, using logic, compasses, and

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:11.350
calming the group by saying that they will
get found.

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:16.990
Hutch’s words and hope are quickly extinguished
when Dom mentions that it’s getting dark

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:17.990
again.

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:20.900
It’s pretty apparent that the night is when
things turn bad.

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:24.650
Cut to night, they’ve pitched tents and
Hutch sizes up the group's health.

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:30.660
Dom’s knee is torn up, Phil is more mentally
weakened, and Hutch tells Luke that he should

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:35.660
take the compass, head South-West and try
to make a break for civilization and bring

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:37.280
back help while he stays with them.

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:41.850
Hutch has this sort of, thousand yard stare
thing going, like his mind is trying to find

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:43.820
a way out of this predicament.

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:49.840
While he was spreading hope earlier, deep
down, he knows their situation is dire.

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:54.430
Considering he’s the most experienced hiker
in the group, this is unnerving.

00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:58.650
They all get tucked into their tents for the
night, and right when Luke goes for a midnight

00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:01.600
pop-tart snack, the forest comes alive.

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:07.240
I can’t imagine how vulnerable it must feel
being in a tiny tent, with a thin piece of

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:12.200
fabric between you and a monster creeping
through the woods just outside.

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:21.490
Luke draws down the loudest zipper mankind
has created, and most likely shit himself

00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:26.650
when he sees three shadowy figures in the
forest, staring at him from the darkness.

00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:32.760
It’s a PTSD trip like the one he had when
he was hit in the chest, except in this nightmare,

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:44.550
the mugger eerily makes eye contact with Luke,
mocking him as a coward, before the forest

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:48.250
erupts into branches breaking and trees moving
around his tent.

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:52.650
We get a jarring moment where Luke witnesses
Hutch’s tent being ripped up from the ground

00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:57.510
and sucked into the trees, where he then wakes
up to Phil screaming and Hutch’s bloody

00:08:57.510 --> 00:09:00.080
tent torn open, and Hutch missing.

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:03.870
Luke’s nightmares and reality don’t appear
to be two separate things.

00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:14.360
We then hear Hutch yelping in severe pain
from deep in the forest.

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:19.840
The remaining three friends courageously attempt
a rescue, but as we all know, Hutch is pretty

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:21.000
much a goner.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.770
At dawn, the search continues, where they
stumble across their worst fears.

00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:30.630
Hutch, like the elk from earlier, is found
gutted, hanging from the trees.

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:36.110
It’s an incredibly gruesome sight, and this
is the exact moment when shit got real for

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:37.110
the group.

00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:41.140
The hope of making it back in one piece is
irreversibly over.

00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:45.930
This is the moment where their lives were
permanently changed forever, or at least until

00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:47.890
they get hung from the trees too.

00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:53.610
This is also a huge blow because Hutch was
the one leading them out of this mess, this

00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:56.020
most likely isn’t a coincidence either.

00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:57.920
Phil says something interesting.

00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:02.390
He thinks the monster put Hutch’s corpse
on this path because it knew they were coming

00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:03.640
this way.

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:09.330
Dom yet again loses his shit in denial, claiming
that it was pagan hillbillies that did this.

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:13.920
Luke steps into Hutch’s bloody shoes as
the fearless leader of the group, affirming

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:16.570
that they are going to get out of the forest
alive.

00:10:16.570 --> 00:10:19.620
I don’t think any of them actually believed
it though.

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:24.610
They find footprints leading somewhere, but
they smartly avoid following them, choosing

00:10:24.610 --> 00:10:27.720
instead to go South-West as planned.

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:33.610
As they ascend the ridge, we see the monster,
perfectly camouflaged in the background.

00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:38.440
One could speculate that the footprints were
incredibly obvious, and with the monster watching

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:41.720
from a distance, this might have been some
sort of trap.

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:45.320
While Dom is panicky and hot-headed, Phil
is something else.

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:50.160
He looks pale and sickly, and it is deeply
disturbed and mentally unstable.

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:55.030
Stating that the monster got inside his head,
made him pray to it, and that he can’t get

00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:56.030
it out.

00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:59.260
I’m starting to wonder how they thought
they could make it out of the forest in less

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:00.770
than one day.

00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:04.610
Even with all the events that have unfolded,
it seems they should be close.

00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:10.500
Oh yep, they are close, just hours away, which
might as well be a thousand miles considering

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:12.650
night is now falling upon them.

00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:16.630
Let’s just say, it’s about to get bumpy.

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:19.850
And Phil got rekted before the sun completely
went down.

00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:23.870
At least he got the famous last words in,
“I think I heard something,” before being

00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:37.980
dragged off screen to be slaughtered.

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:43.560
Yes Phil, that was the sound of a giant forest
monster lurking behind you.

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:48.620
Luke springs into action, and with immense
athleticism, manages to run into a tree and

00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:53.730
knock himself out, where he then wakes up
at the familiar convenience store.

00:11:53.730 --> 00:12:00.940
Only this time, instead of the mugger calling
him a coward, Robert tells Luke that he can’t

00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:03.820
run.

00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:07.420
To which then, Luke proceeds to get up and
run.

00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:11.970
Just like at the cabin, and the tent, the
monster is communicating with Luke through

00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:13.840
the hallucinations.

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:18.190
Luke finds Dom and they both cuddle up next
to a tree, while Dom cries on Luke's shoulder

00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:22.560
and Luke says he’ll never leave Dom under
a moonlit night sky.

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:28.130
On three they make a run for the treeline,
but end up on a firelit path leading to either

00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:31.010
civilization or pagan hillbillies.

00:12:31.010 --> 00:12:35.910
Considering the monster is right behind them,
they take the risk and follow the path.

00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:41.730
Just before they bolt, the flashlight illuminates
Phils lifeless body, hanging from a tree.

00:12:41.730 --> 00:12:46.410
In sick irony, Phil saying that the monster
put Hutch’s body in their path so they would

00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:49.680
find it was exactly what happened to Phil.

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:54.490
The monster is intelligently directing them,
and placing their friends dead bodies in their

00:12:54.490 --> 00:12:56.400
path for them to see.

00:12:56.400 --> 00:13:01.830
As soon as Dom and Luke bust into the nearest
cabin, they quickly realize it was a mistake,

00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:07.120
as the occupants aren’t alarmed at the situation,
it was almost as if they’d been expecting

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:09.029
the duo to show up.

00:13:09.029 --> 00:13:13.370
Luke also see’s that they are praying to
a stone carved with the representation of

00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:15.170
the Norse god Loki.

00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:19.750
The stone is called the Loki stone, and depicts
Loki chained up.

00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:21.170
Probably not a good sign.

00:13:21.170 --> 00:13:27.700
It’s confirmed that there will be no hospitality
given here as they get face stomped into unconsciousness.

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:39.610
They wake up in shackles with ritualistic
chants roaring above them, people erecting

00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:43.910
human-sized crosses, and a creepy old lady
feeding them water.

00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:46.980
Not exactly a 5-star bed and breakfast.

00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:51.350
The creepy old lady reveals she is injured
in the same way Luke is.

00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:56.690
At this point it’s clear that this injury
is a mark of ritualistic importance.

00:13:56.690 --> 00:14:01.841
Unfortunately for Dom, he doesn’t have the
mark, and is dragged into the attic to be

00:14:01.841 --> 00:14:07.260
blessed by prayers in preparation for his
sacrifice.

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:16.279
Yah, I don’t think they were building a
Wendy’s outside after all.

00:14:16.279 --> 00:14:22.120
The cult brings Dom back inside so he can
have one last chat with Luke before this evening’s

00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:23.120
show.

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:27.130
He reveals that earlier in the cabin, when
Hutch was alive and pissing himself and he

00:14:27.130 --> 00:14:31.720
was in the corner crying and screaming the
name Gayle, that his nightmare was the future

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:36.830
prediction that he would end up here, being
sacrificed to the monster.

00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:42.880
It brings a sense of dread and inevitability
to the situation, which Dom obviously realizes

00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:45.090
by saying that he will die here.

00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:49.180
The monster literally forecasted everything
that happened to the group.

00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:52.890
It’s placement of Hutch and Phil’s corpses
was no coincidence.

00:14:52.890 --> 00:14:55.850
It herded them to the cult.

00:14:55.850 --> 00:15:01.560
Dom’s chilling final request is that Luke
burns the place to the ground, that he never

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:05.930
stops, that he lives on as best he can, and
to tell his wife he did what he could to get

00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:06.930
back to her.

00:15:06.930 --> 00:15:12.050
The cult marches Dom out to be sacrificed,
where numerous other corpses are hanging from

00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:13.570
the tree’s in full view.

00:15:13.570 --> 00:15:18.500
The sacrificial cross is actually in the shape
as one of the symbols they saw earlier, which

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:20.080
translates to elk.

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:25.670
In an attempt to rescue Dom, Luke breaks his
thumb in order to slip out of his shackles,

00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:28.649
he gets out of one, but cant get his other
hand free.

00:15:28.649 --> 00:15:32.160
I’m not sure Luke could have done much if
he did get free though.

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:37.030
This is an important moment for Luke, as he
was now ready to take personal injury while

00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:39.130
fighting for his friends.

00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:41.700
Despite his best efforts, he’s too late.

00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:45.770
As was foretold in the nightmare, Gayle emerged
from the woods.

00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:50.700
Only we know now that the monster has some
form of telepathic abilities, and is assuming

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:56.380
the figure of Dom’s wife, before dragging
him into the forest to be hung from the tree’s.

00:15:56.380 --> 00:16:01.080
We do get a good look at the monster’s face
hole, and it’s pretty clear this is nothing

00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:02.960
humans have encountered before.

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:07.529
Why hang the bodies from the trees though,
what significance does that have.

00:16:07.529 --> 00:16:12.630
It may be some sort of nod to other Norse
mythology where the god Odin was said to gain

00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:17.830
knowledge and power by sacrificially impaling
and hanging himself on a tree.

00:16:17.830 --> 00:16:23.120
Why did the monster need the cult to sacrifice
Dom instead of hunting him like Hutch and

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:24.240
Phil?

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:29.110
Considering all the ritualistic worshiping,
it appears to be more of the ego thing the

00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:30.300
monster has.

00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:35.020
Killing all the friends in the woods with
nobody to see is like a basketball team playing

00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:36.750
with nobody in the stands.

00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:43.230
It’s also a show of power to the cult, a
warning.

00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:45.710
Why did the monster appear as Gayle?

00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:50.350
It may be it’s ego and need to be revered
and worshiped that caused the monster to appear

00:16:50.350 --> 00:16:52.490
as Gayle when killing Dom.

00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:57.230
Dom revered Gayle and the monster wanted to
find someone to look at it like how Dom looks

00:16:57.230 --> 00:16:58.460
at Gayle.

00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:03.540
Another answer is that the monster despises
people with good lives, as it cannot as easily

00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:05.720
convert them to a worshiper.

00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:11.210
It torments Dom by first appearing as Gayle,
before revealing it’s true grotesque nature

00:17:11.210 --> 00:17:12.640
as it kills him.

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:16.780
Why did the monster choose Dom to sacrifice,
and not the others?

00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:20.980
Possibly because Dom is wounded, and is easier
for the cult to control.

00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:25.589
I don’t think the cult had the capacity
to detain all four friends at once.

00:17:25.589 --> 00:17:27.670
They’d pose too much of a danger.

00:17:27.670 --> 00:17:30.780
It killed off the stronger and healthier of
the friends first.

00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:34.520
Dom, with his injured leg was an easier catch
for the cult.

00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:39.300
A younger woman enters the cabin, who appears
to be the little girl from the picture in

00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:42.970
the wallet at the abandoned tent the group
found earlier.

00:17:42.970 --> 00:17:47.960
Luke asks if they took Dom’s body down from
the trees, to which she replies, we don’t

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:49.309
move the bodies.

00:17:49.309 --> 00:17:55.020
She tells Luke that the monster is an ancient
nordic god named Moder, and is the slightly

00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:57.970
less charming offspring of Tom Hiddleston.

00:17:57.970 --> 00:18:02.920
The cult worships Moder, and in return it
provides them with protection and everlasting

00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:08.770
life without pain, and if that sounds too
good to be true, it’s because it is.

00:18:08.770 --> 00:18:13.559
But it’s not like you have a door number
2, if you don’t worship it, you’ll end

00:18:13.559 --> 00:18:16.410
up like Hutch, Phil, Dom, and countless others.

00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:20.390
We again see that this lady bears the mark
that Luke has.

00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:26.050
When asked, why him, she responds that she
believes it is because his pain is great.

00:18:26.050 --> 00:18:31.000
It’s now that we’re clued in that the
god marks those it wants as worshippers, selecting

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.080
only those with immense emotional baggage.

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:39.370
This is another clue that this woman is the
little girl from the picture, as she is distant

00:18:39.370 --> 00:18:44.330
and unsmiling while her family is happy and
hugging each other, suggesting that she also

00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:45.330
carries great pain.

00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:46.620
The mark is over the heart, as this is traditionally
where deep emotional pain is said to be felt.

00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:51.100
Back in the cabin where all the friends had
nightmares, these nightmares were most likely

00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:56.320
caused by Moder gripping their hearts and
feeling out which one of them it would choose.

00:18:56.320 --> 00:19:01.240
Dom was screaming for Gayle, possibly suggesting
that he missed her and regretted not spending

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:02.640
more time with her.

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:07.390
Phil was praying to the effigy, possibly suggesting
that he had some unresolved issues with a

00:19:07.390 --> 00:19:10.300
commitment to a religion or higher power.

00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:15.550
Hutch losing his bowels may suggest that his
pain was in losing control, as he was the

00:19:15.550 --> 00:19:20.130
leader who seemingly always had a handle on
the group, and was constantly trying to keep

00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:21.700
them on path.

00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:25.540
Obviously Luke, carrying the guilt from Rob's
death at the liquor store, was the one whose

00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:28.150
heart the monster gripped the hardest.

00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:32.510
The monster clearly herded Luke to the cult
instead of killing him, which it had plenty

00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:36.980
of opportunities to do earlier, so that he
could become a worshiper of it.

00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:42.500
Now, our boy Luke has had some character development
over the past hour and 20 minutes, he’s

00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:46.040
not about to take any more shit from Loki’s
ugly ass son.

00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:50.200
He grabs a torch and heads upstairs to check
out the congregation.

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:59.040
Instead of opening the door to find Benny
Hinn, Luke discovers probably the creepiest

00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:00.540
thing we’ve seen yet.

00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:04.320
The worshipers are all mummified remains of
elder cult members.

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:09.720
He has some serious cojones for walking into
that room, I'd have tossed the torch in and

00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:11.650
noped out of there.

00:20:11.650 --> 00:20:17.360
Remember when I said everlasting life was
too good to be true, yah, this is Moders gift

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:18.631
in all its glory.

00:20:18.631 --> 00:20:23.790
It’s the hellacious side of everlasting
life, as they aged but didn’t die, and since

00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:29.059
their mummified remains can’t ever leave,
they are stuck in that attic, forced to worship

00:20:29.059 --> 00:20:41.480
Moder forever, well until Luke mercy kills
them by lighting them all on fire, ultimately

00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:43.610
living up to his promise to Dom.

00:20:43.610 --> 00:20:54.580
Badass Luke absolutely rocks granny with a
straight right jab, then grabs a german kar98k

00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:58.150
bolt action rifle and a couple rounds of 8mm
ammo.

00:20:58.150 --> 00:21:03.330
On a side note, this could be a subtle indication
that this monster god has been abducting hikers

00:21:03.330 --> 00:21:05.760
since before 1935.

00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:10.400
I mean obviously Moder’s been around for
awhile since he’s an ancient god, but I

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:12.140
think it’s worth pointing out.

00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:17.200
Moder returns from the woods, pissed off at
his beautiful church being burned down.

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:22.590
Luke blasts the creepy bald guy with his newfound
rifle, then akimbos the rifle and an axe as

00:21:22.590 --> 00:21:28.640
he turns around to see Moder in the doorway,
who drops the super dead eyes gouged out blonde

00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:33.150
woman to the ground as a kind of, see what
you caused type of taunt.

00:21:33.150 --> 00:21:38.000
Earlier the blonde woman looked up at Moder
and whispered a reply to it, we don’t know

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:43.010
what she said, but I think fair to say that
Moder is mad and punishing it’s worshipers

00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:49.430
for allowing Luke to burn down the elders.

00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:55.420
Luke busts out the backdoor and into the woods
while Moder picks up dead Annie, presumably

00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:57.260
to hang her from the trees.

00:21:57.260 --> 00:22:00.990
He fires the rifle at the monster with his
last remaining round.

00:22:00.990 --> 00:22:05.670
We don’t really know if Luke hit Moder with
the bullet, but Moder seems pretty unphased.

00:22:05.670 --> 00:22:12.180
Moder is what you might consider to be, big
game, which means one 8mm round won’t do

00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:13.960
the trick anyway.

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:19.640
Realizing this, Luke takes off for the treeline
with the displeased monster chasing him down.

00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:24.250
That damn convenience store shows up again,
meaning that he definitely did not lose Moder

00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:25.470
in the woods.

00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:30.680
He then gets bucked to the ground by the elk
god, and now has Luke in his tiny hand’s

00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:31.680
grasp.

00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:35.890
Just when you think Lukes about to become
a tree ornament, Moder tosses him on the ground

00:22:35.890 --> 00:22:51.110
and starts flexing on him, establishing its
dominance like a gorilla beating its chest.

00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:55.940
As soon as Luke stands up in defiance, Moder
quickly shoves him back down into the kneeling

00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:56.940
position.

00:22:56.940 --> 00:23:02.299
Luke hallucinates one last time, and see’s
Robert on the ground next to him, Robert turns

00:23:02.299 --> 00:23:07.740
to look at him, almost as a suggestion from
Moder that he needs to cowardly submit to

00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:10.679
Moder like he submitted to the muggers.

00:23:10.679 --> 00:23:15.350
It might not be those with great pain that
the god chooses for worshipers, but instead

00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:18.620
it chooses those who are most likely to submit
to it.

00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:21.940
We’re led to believe it chooses the biggest
cowards.

00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:26.780
I have some problems with this though, as
after Hutch is killed it’s clear that Luke

00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:29.480
ain’t gonna be nobody's bitch, he’s done
being a coward and he assumed the stronger

00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:36.670
leader role, while Phil showed much less mental
resolve and arguably would be an easier target.

00:23:36.670 --> 00:23:42.220
Though Phil’s golden ticket may have been
revoked because of his disrespect at the cabin

00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:43.220
earlier.

00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:46.929
I don’t know though, earlier when they saw
the footprints leading presumably to the cult

00:23:46.929 --> 00:23:49.160
camp, Phil was still alive.

00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:54.930
Moder may have actually wanted Phil too, but
since they take the bait, it decided to kill

00:23:54.930 --> 00:23:55.930
him.

00:23:55.930 --> 00:23:59.710
The blonde lady did mention that Moder will
take away their pain, so Luke’s immense

00:23:59.710 --> 00:24:02.200
guilt is what might make him the target.

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:06.910
In order for Moder to take away someone’s
pain as a motivation to become a worshiper,

00:24:06.910 --> 00:24:09.080
that person has to have pain to begin with.

00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:14.530
It’s apparent now that Moder’s main motivation
is to satisfy it’s ego by building a group

00:24:14.530 --> 00:24:18.630
of followers to worship it, much like an instagram
ho.

00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:23.230
This is also maybe why it made Phil strip
down naked and beg for his life to the headless

00:24:23.230 --> 00:24:28.880
antler-hand effigy for disrespecting it by
saying "I'll pay a thousand to whoever shacks

00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:31.429
up with the thing tonight."

00:24:31.429 --> 00:24:36.340
Luke says fuck that noise, picks up the axe
laying beside him that Moder seemed to forget

00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:42.429
about, and thrusts it into the monsters head,
drawing the blood of the ancient god creature.

00:24:42.429 --> 00:24:46.690
Luke makes it to the treeline, where the forest
seems to have some sort of electric shock

00:24:46.690 --> 00:24:49.220
collar fencing that Moder can’t go beyond.

00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:55.090
It could also be interpreted that the monster
is also a bit of a coward and all it’s shenanigans

00:24:55.090 --> 00:25:00.320
were a defensive projection of it’s own
cowardice as it hides in the forest and doesn’t

00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:02.299
want to be seen in the open.

00:25:02.299 --> 00:25:06.830
Luke is barefoot and out of breath, he hasn't
had time to grieve his dead friends.

00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:09.630
He's face to face with a mythical monster.

00:25:09.630 --> 00:25:15.040
It roars in anger, Luke, too stricken to feel
fear of death screams back in sadness and

00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:16.040
defiance.

00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:20.730
He's no longer a coward, but what does it
matter when all his friends were murdered.

00:25:20.730 --> 00:25:24.559
How can he even begin to explain or cope with
what he has endured.

00:25:24.559 --> 00:25:30.000
The movie leaves Luke to make his solitary
journey back home so he can be imprisoned

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:35.630
as he’s painted as a mentally unstable PTSD
afflicted person who lost his mind and murdered

00:25:35.630 --> 00:25:36.850
his friends in the forest.

00:25:36.850 --> 00:25:41.960
What, did you think we’d really believe
an ancient monster god killed them?

00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:46.809
What he should have done, is kept the axe
he used to draw the god’s blood, and used

00:25:46.809 --> 00:25:51.320
that as biological evidence of an unworldly
creature that attacked them.

00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:55.220
If you want to know more about how to beat
Moder, I'll have a video on that as well.

00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:59.950
Anyways, this movie had more depth and raised
more questions than I expected, so let me

00:25:59.950 --> 00:26:01.429
know what you guys thought of it!

00:26:01.429 --> 00:26:03.840
Thanks for watching!
