this guy is the unluckiest man in the world jion&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:31.440
here has just gambled the last of his life savings&nbsp;
on a horse track and manages to win 4 million own&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:38.160
collecting the money from the tether he runs&nbsp;
out to spend his new hard-earned cash and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:45.440
steps outside to call his family with the good&nbsp;
news he's on top of the world but that's when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:53.440
he notices a gang of lone sharks approaching&nbsp;
him and realizes his luck has just run out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.440 --> 00:01:02.080
panicking he runs back inside to escape them but&nbsp;
crashes into his oman and falls to the ground now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:11.680
realizing that this pickpocket has just stolen all&nbsp;
of his weaning the lone sharks finally corner him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:19.600
in the restroom to collect his debt but when he&nbsp;
checks his pocket he finds it's slashed open and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:27.520
his money has disappeared with nothing to collect&nbsp;
be forced to sign his contract with his own blood&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:36.080
promising to pay them back in one month depressed&nbsp;
the glamour sits on the subway bench to wait for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:44.000
that next rain home when this businessman comes&nbsp;
over to talk to him he asks segun here wants to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:51.200
play a game and the clamber thinks he is just&nbsp;
an annoying salesman but then he opens his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:59.120
briefcase reviewing stocks of cash and two folded&nbsp;
paper squares the salesman invites him to play the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:07.120
korean game duck is promising to give him a&nbsp;
hundred thousand own every time he wins but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:15.600
he will have to pay the salesman if he loses it's&nbsp;
a ridiculous gamble but with everything to gain&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:22.560
jivin decides he's in the man places he folded&nbsp;
paper on the ground and the glamour tries to flip&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:30.640
it over but he only manages to make the red tile&nbsp;
jump his failed but when the salesman takes his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:38.240
turn he flips it over on the first try jion tells&nbsp;
the man he doesn't have the money to pay him but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:45.680
the salesman offers to reduce his debt in return&nbsp;
for one slap in the face it's an offer he can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:52.960
refuse and desperate to win he takes the slap&nbsp;
to continue playing he keeps losing each round&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.960 --> 00:03:01.040
getting smack after smack until finally he throws&nbsp;
down his tile and flips the salesman's paper over&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:08.720
julian has just went a hundred grand for playing&nbsp;
a children's game but it's not as innocent as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:16.080
it may seem okay first of all let me just say&nbsp;
that this guy here needs to be careful because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:24.800
if any of these trains are going to busan then he&nbsp;
is going to instantly regret it now as for guild&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:33.280
here accepting this game was a terrible idea this&nbsp;
man can't stop himself on gambling with money he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:41.920
doesn't even have and against someone who works&nbsp;
in front of dutchy in his suitcase and is clearly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:50.480
better at the game than him anyone with a brain&nbsp;
without take that bit but once kion realizes that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:57.280
it's free money and only requires a slab in&nbsp;
the face to keep playing he doesn't stop to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:05.040
consider that this whole situation is suspicious&nbsp;
as hell look at this guy's outfit here this man&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:12.480
is strictly on business and since he approached&nbsp;
him with such a specific agenda it tells us he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:19.040
already knew that julian is a degenerated camper&nbsp;
and he's targeting him for some hidden reason the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:26.000
salesman gave him every possible chance to make&nbsp;
sure he's owned some money from him and nobody&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:34.480
tries that hard to lose money unless what you are&nbsp;
getting in a return is much more valuable jian was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:42.800
too greedy to recognize any of these warning signs&nbsp;
and the man let his emotions get the better of him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:49.600
now none of this guy's suspicious behavior matters&nbsp;
if you had a proven strategy to play and win&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:57.200
dakdy is a game that korean school kids play&nbsp;
and it's so popular that the game is even&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:03.680
televised for mass entertainment but it's not&nbsp;
the strongest player who wins this game it's the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:11.840
smartest and most coordinated if you look at&nbsp;
this player here he manages to flip the player in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:18.080
one try and that's because he used the&nbsp;
most surface area to make more contact&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:26.160
with the other paper if you can strike the target&nbsp;
with the flat side of your dark g paper then the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:33.040
momentum will be transferred and carry the&nbsp;
paper up on the bounds so that it flips&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:40.400
over this might seem counterintuitive but&nbsp;
it's just playing physics and you can see this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:47.920
player was not successful because he was trying&nbsp;
to use the age which is not opening strategy if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:55.280
jian here had known the best way to play&nbsp;
this game he could hustle his businessman for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:03.760
all his cash and walk away without having to get&nbsp;
slapped in the process now even though he own&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:11.440
this one victory will soon leave the gambler to&nbsp;
play in six of the most terrifying death game&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:17.360
you could possibly imagine and instead of a&nbsp;
slap in the cheek he will soon be gambling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:25.200
with his life julian here collects his warnings&nbsp;
and the salesman tells him he can win more money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:31.520
playing other children's games but he turns&nbsp;
down the offer that's when the salesman stands&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:39.760
up and reveals he knows the exact amount of money&nbsp;
gulen owes to loan sharks and that he will be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:48.560
killed if he doesn't pay it back the gambler asked&nbsp;
him how he knows this and the salesman hands him a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:56.480
business card telling him to call if he wants to&nbsp;
join the competition of a lifetime jion considers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:02.640
his offer but this will be the biggest mistake&nbsp;
of his life celebrating his newfound luck&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:09.440
he turns back home to have dinner with his mother&nbsp;
but the woman knows the money came from gambling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:16.640
she tells him that his ex-wife is planning to move&nbsp;
to america and he will only be able to see his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:25.520
daughter if he has the finances to prove he can&nbsp;
care for her gn is devastated and realizing she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:31.040
is right he decides to call the number on the&nbsp;
business card telling the salesman that he accepts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:38.800
his offer to play another game later that night he&nbsp;
waits outside to be picked up when a van pulls up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:46.880
to the sidewalk getting inside he begins to notice&nbsp;
that all the other passengers are asleep but when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:54.800
the van starts to feel weak toxic gas the gambler&nbsp;
realizes he is just a big time and gets knocked&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.800 --> 00:08:02.400
unconscious when the man opens his eyes he wakes&nbsp;
up to find himself lying in a bunk bed surrounded&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:11.520
by hundreds of others and courts just like him&nbsp;
they are all wearing uniforms and numbers on them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:19.200
and as everyone gathers in the center of the&nbsp;
room the front door opens and a team of guards&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:26.480
walk inside this man of the square mask tells&nbsp;
them they will be played in six different&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:34.800
games and those who make it through all six games&nbsp;
will get a cash prize this man demands to know why&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:41.360
they were brought here and the guard presses a&nbsp;
button playing a montage of several people being&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:49.680
slapped everyone in this room is drowning in debt&nbsp;
and they have all been invited here to win enough&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:58.720
money to play it off the players all line up to&nbsp;
some constant forms with three clauses stating&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:06.240
that they must keep on playing that if they refuse&nbsp;
to play they will be eliminated and that the games&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:13.120
can be ended if the majority of players agree to&nbsp;
stop okay there's nothing more dangerous than a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:20.240
room full of desperate people who have nothing&nbsp;
to lose and that's why the real threat are these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:28.400
players not just the games for the video that was&nbsp;
played we can see the taxi salesman use the same&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:35.200
trick on everybody and they have only invited&nbsp;
players who are willing to gamble money they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:44.480
don't have on a game they are unlucky to win its&nbsp;
textbook psychological manipulation and it proves&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:53.040
this wasn't a game for cash this was a test that&nbsp;
everyone in the room passed and now they know what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:59.680
we are willing to say yes to which should scare&nbsp;
the crap out of us if we all agree to play for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:06.640
more money then we can be sure that the plenty of&nbsp;
losing is going to be a lot worse than a few slaps&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:13.360
now if you pay close attention to the details&nbsp;
of this place you will realize that villain&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:20.800
here is about to have a really shitty day because&nbsp;
this place looks like a death camp designed by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:28.640
ikea and even refugee camps don't just take their&nbsp;
bank six beds high and everyone is given a uniform&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:35.680
with a number instead of their name so their&nbsp;
identities have been stripped from them and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:42.240
it's an immediate red flag that this is going&nbsp;
to be become a death game if prison rules apply&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:49.680
here then there are 455 other people who&nbsp;
might kill you to get ahead and it won't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:57.920
matter what game you are playing the best strategy&nbsp;
right now is to lay low stay quiet and observe our&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:03.760
surroundings to gain more information to&nbsp;
make sure we have a competitive advantage&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:11.280
a key thing to notice here is that these guards&nbsp;
have different shapes on their mask but this could&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:18.640
indicate different work rows the circles could&nbsp;
be workers and the square make could be a manner&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:25.840
of some kind of recognizing power is extremely&nbsp;
important because it helps you behave accordingly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:32.800
and pleasing of the wrong person just might get&nbsp;
you killed now singing this contract is the cherry&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:40.800
on top of the death game here because after being&nbsp;
dragged against your will and kidnapped this whole&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:47.680
enterprise is completely illegal which means&nbsp;
the contract can't be binded this is designed to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:54.080
create the illusion of choice and keep you playing&nbsp;
even when and this start getting really up the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:54.080 --> 00:12:01.840
fact that nobody here has realized this contract&nbsp;
is meaningless tells us they aren't prepared for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:08.560
what's about to happen next after being proceeds&nbsp;
they are all taken to their first game entering an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:16.640
outdoor room with a massive clearing and in front&nbsp;
of them is a giant doll standing at the other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:23.760
end of the field jun here recognizes one of the&nbsp;
players as his childhood friend sangu and walks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:31.760
up to say hello suddenly the gates behind them&nbsp;
locked shut and the competitors are told they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:38.960
will be playing the children's game red light&nbsp;
green light players must run to the finish line&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:46.800
while the doll looks away but if it looks back&nbsp;
and catches them moving they will be eliminated&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:53.600
they have only five minutes to cross the finish&nbsp;
line and with that the game begins the players&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:59.680
start running across the field but the doll&nbsp;
suddenly announces red light before anyone expects&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:07.840
it and this player is caught completely off guard&nbsp;
it spots the man still trying to catch his balance&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:15.440
and a voice announces that he's eliminated&nbsp;
suddenly a gunshot rings out and the player&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:23.840
collapsed to the ground motionless he's just been&nbsp;
shot dead and realized they have been tricked into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:30.640
playing a death game everyone starts running for&nbsp;
the exits but the doll is detecting every moment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:38.480
and bullets start flying by the time the shooting&nbsp;
stops over 100 people have been murdered and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:46.080
surviving players are left frozen in fear the doll&nbsp;
turns it head back announcing its green light and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:53.760
the group starts moving again determined to make&nbsp;
it out of here alive using this guy like a shield&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:53.760 --> 00:14:01.200
this girl cleverly falls behind another player&nbsp;
to hide herself from the door's side the game&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:07.680
girl who stole the gambler's money earlier when&nbsp;
he was running from the loan sharks and without&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:13.600
hesitation she pulls the man down to launch&nbsp;
herself ahead of the packagion here tries to move&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:20.560
forward but he's grabbed by the injured player who&nbsp;
begs him for help one wrong move and he is going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:27.360
to get him shot but luckily the doll turns back&nbsp;
around just in time and he breaks out of the man's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:33.600
grip there's now one minute left and the players&nbsp;
are finally starting to reach the finish line&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:42.160
the man is only a few meters away from being this&nbsp;
game but just as he takes a step forward he trips&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:49.440
over a dead body he's about to fall on the ground&nbsp;
but another player saves him life holding him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:56.880
up until the doll announces green light with only&nbsp;
three seconds on the timer gulen jumps through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:56.880 --> 00:15:02.560
the air and finally makes it across the finish&nbsp;
line and remembering players who haven't crossed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:10.240
are all brutally shot to death and the survivors&nbsp;
look up to notice a massive roof close overhead&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:18.320
they have no idea they are on a private iceland&nbsp;
in the middle of now here and the only way to out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:26.560
of here is to win that's one game down with only&nbsp;
five more to go okay this is the most horrifying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:35.280
children's game i have ever seen but double zero&nbsp;
one here is having the time of his life because he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:41.680
understands something that everyone else is too&nbsp;
scared to realize this game isn't just about speed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:47.760
it's about how much ground you can cover with&nbsp;
enough stability to freeze at any given moment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:56.480
with this in mind the best method here is to walk&nbsp;
with feet flat on the ground and a wide stance so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:56.480 --> 00:16:04.640
our center of gravity stays low and stable this&nbsp;
old man was born for this moment because he moved&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:13.840
with a very stable date and it's the best example&nbsp;
of how everyone there needs to work it they want&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:22.160
to make it now alive now we can't afford to be&nbsp;
frozen and shocked like jion here because there's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:30.800
a lot of ground for us to cover in a very short&nbsp;
time this room is designed to deceive you into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:39.200
thinking it's smaller than it is but there's a&nbsp;
trick we can use to judge the distance so that we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:46.720
know how fast we need to work to reach the finish&nbsp;
line before the clock runs out taking advantage of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:53.840
parallax and anatomy you can actually use your&nbsp;
thumb to figure out the length of the field the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:53.840 --> 00:17:01.200
space between your eyes is about one-tenth the&nbsp;
length of your arm so if you stuck your thumb&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:07.760
out closing one eye after another your thumb&nbsp;
would appear to move one tenth the distance as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:15.440
the card are from where you are standing you can&nbsp;
actually try this right now by sticking your thumb&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:23.440
out in front of you and closing one eye and then&nbsp;
switching to the other eye to see your thumb&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:30.880
move if you do the math here this trick tells us&nbsp;
that we are at least 100 meters away that means&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:38.480
that this place is roughly the length of a soccer&nbsp;
field so if we want to make it across in five&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:45.040
minutes we can't afford to waste even one second&nbsp;
one of the biggest mistakes you can make here is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:52.240
looking at the doll instead of watching where you&nbsp;
are placing your feet it's important to remember&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:59.680
that we aren't responding to visual cues here we&nbsp;
are listening for red light green light we can't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:08.400
risk trapping or accidentally losing our footing&nbsp;
so watching our foot helps us shut out unnecessary&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:14.160
information so we can concentrate on&nbsp;
stability while keeping our ears out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:21.280
for the signals the next thing i would do is try&nbsp;
to protect myself and there's nothing more safe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:28.960
in a death game than finding a good old fashioned&nbsp;
meat shield if we position ourselves behind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:37.360
another person then it makes it much harder for&nbsp;
the robot to detect any movement if we happen to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:45.120
flinch at a gunshot or react to another player&nbsp;
dying close by so walking behind someone is the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:54.320
best insurance we have to hide it now the most&nbsp;
dangerous element of the scenario is actually the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:54.320 --> 00:19:02.240
other players trapped in here with us we have to&nbsp;
realize that we are extremely vulnerable to anyone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:09.520
who wants to communicate their way out of here&nbsp;
if you get pushed over then you are taking you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:16.640
out with them and it only takes one tiny movement&nbsp;
to get you killed so we will need to stay far&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:23.600
enough away from people that they can't interfere&nbsp;
with their process the best way to do this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:31.840
is to position yourself along this wall into&nbsp;
this also give us another point stability to help&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:39.040
us stop in time and we can make it to the finish&nbsp;
line without getting killed after the game the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:47.600
guards come in to congratulate the survivors on&nbsp;
passing and announced that 255 players were killed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:56.080
it's a horrifying number and afraid of her life&nbsp;
this woman steps forward begging the man to let&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:56.080 --> 00:20:04.560
her go home several other players joined her&nbsp;
in protest but that's when this massive piggy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:12.480
bank drop in above them and start to feel with&nbsp;
more cash than you have ever seen in their lives&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:20.320
the survivors are shocked and the must man tells&nbsp;
everyone that they have an opportunity to win&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:28.880
45.6 billion own but if anyone lives then&nbsp;
they won't get a single penny with that a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:36.720
voting machine is set up in front of them and they&nbsp;
all cast their votes but the majority of players&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:44.960
agreed to quite the must man tells them they can&nbsp;
still come back if a majority agrees to compete&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:52.320
again and the players are sent back home now it&nbsp;
turns out that every single one of them realize&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:52.320 --> 00:21:00.720
their lives outside are much worse than they&nbsp;
remember and gian here returns to keep playing but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:08.400
they are all going to instantly regret it&nbsp;
because this next death game is even more screwed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:16.080
up than the last the van take them and to the&nbsp;
private iceland where a team of workers dressed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:24.240
them into their uniforms and the players finally&nbsp;
wakes up back in the same place as if they never&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:30.960
left later that night coolant talks with his&nbsp;
childhood friend and suggested they team up for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:38.480
the next game to increase their odds of winning&nbsp;
the man agrees it's wise to join forces and spawn&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:45.200
the players who rescued him last game the gambler&nbsp;
insists this man joined them too that's when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:52.400
the old man asked if he can also be a part of&nbsp;
their team and gulen happily accepts him into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:52.400 --> 00:22:00.080
the group but his friend is not happy he invited&nbsp;
someone so old to join their team the next morning&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:09.440
all the players are laid into a new arena and as&nbsp;
they pour in they find an oversized playground&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:17.680
in front of them if voice instructs them to line&nbsp;
up in front of one of the four ships on the walls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:26.960
and their choices are a circle triangle star and&nbsp;
umbrella that's when changu here has a flashback&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:34.960
to his childhood and suddenly realizes what this&nbsp;
game is but the man doesn't tell anyone what he's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:42.960
just discovered jion here ask him if they should&nbsp;
all choose the same shape but he rejects the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:51.520
idea suggesting they should split up to reduce the&nbsp;
risk finally the doors open as announcer instructs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:58.800
them to take a case of the tables and the&nbsp;
players find a thin piece of hard sponge trophy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:05.920
with a shape in the middle they will have to use&nbsp;
the needle to poke out the shape in 10 minutes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:13.280
but if they crack it they will be executed&nbsp;
the game begins and gulen here carefully&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:19.920
starts breaking off piece of the candy but&nbsp;
another player immediately cracks his honeycomb&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:27.040
in half without hesitation the guard pulls out&nbsp;
his pistol and shoots the man dead making him the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:34.320
first casualty of his game it starts a chain&nbsp;
reaction as more people are executed without&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:40.400
mercy june is waiting for the pressure in&nbsp;
the umbrella is the hardest shape to cut but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:50.160
suddenly the man has a relevation revelation&nbsp;
seeing the bits of sweat falling onto the candy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:58.560
he realizes he might be able to melt it with his&nbsp;
saliva from the bottle because the outline the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:05.040
shape is thinner than the rest of the honeycomb&nbsp;
he starts to leak the toffee while other players&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:12.880
begin to follow his lead and with 12 seconds&nbsp;
left on the clock jion desperately breaks apart&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:21.040
his honeycomb perfectly removing the umbrella&nbsp;
from the mall despite all odds he is on again&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:28.240
there's two games so with four more to go okay&nbsp;
this might seem easy but if you pick the wrong&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:35.040
shape in this game you have an extremely&nbsp;
low chance of surviving for those of you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:42.000
who are unfamiliar this candy is known as take&nbsp;
owner and removing the shape without cracking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:49.840
it is very common game that korean vendors play&nbsp;
with kids which is why the players recognize it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:58.160
as soon as they open their tin cans it's made out&nbsp;
of melted sugar and baking soda creating a unique&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:06.640
structure inside which makes it hard to predict&nbsp;
how it might crack in fracture machines this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:14.320
known as strain energy and when it releases&nbsp;
other micro cracks start to spread making it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:20.720
crumble more easily that it is exactly&nbsp;
what makes this game so challenging because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:27.360
as careful as you are is just might make your&nbsp;
candy crack on your without warning and you will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:35.520
be shot in the face the more sharp angles there&nbsp;
are in the shape the more you are likely to break&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:42.160
it and that's why jion hair is completely&nbsp;
screwed because he chose an umbrella which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:50.000
has the most angles by far this teammate here&nbsp;
told everyone to split up to spread out the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:57.680
risk but if you think about it his suggestion is&nbsp;
total bull spreading out just makes it harder for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:57.680 --> 00:26:04.560
the group to work together because they won't&nbsp;
be facing the same problems for this reason i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:12.400
would have suggested that we all select the same&nbsp;
shape so that whatever solutions we can find we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:20.480
can all benefits from them and when it's clear&nbsp;
that this guy is intentionally trying to get the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:27.280
other players killed in order to increase the&nbsp;
price pool for himself and that's cold blooded as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:34.160
hell now there's still a way to increase your&nbsp;
chance of choosing the right shape without working&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:41.520
what the game is locked at how these first two&nbsp;
players rush in to select a shape before anyone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:49.920
else both of them choose triangle and when nobody&nbsp;
supposed to know what the game is yet it probably&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:55.520
means they recognize the game from their&nbsp;
childhood now this doesn't guarantee that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:55.520 --> 00:27:04.320
triangle is the best choice but given they are so&nbsp;
sure of themselves when the stakes are life and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:11.760
death it's not unreasonable to assume that someone&nbsp;
this confident has probably figured something out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:18.720
if the players were unsure of their decision they&nbsp;
would take more time to think about it and if you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:26.000
have no idea what the game is following their&nbsp;
lead to going to be your best option now if it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:33.680
just so happens that we get stuck with the worst&nbsp;
shape possible there's still hope there because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:41.520
the rules never stated that you could only use the&nbsp;
needle and that opens up a lot more possibilities&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:49.920
too when using your saliva is a smart move because&nbsp;
giant weight makes the candy softer and you will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:57.360
be able to cut the shape out without cracking it&nbsp;
this might seem obvious but under a craze about a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:57.360 --> 00:28:03.760
stress like this it's hard to see other solutions&nbsp;
if you are already told now you are supposed to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:12.240
solve them and most of the players here were so&nbsp;
fixated on using the needle they didn't stop the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:19.760
thing outside of the box this is actually very&nbsp;
similar to the candle problem which was a famous&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:28.480
psychological test in the 1950s the subjects&nbsp;
were given a table a box of thumb backs some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:35.520
matches and a candle they were then instructed to&nbsp;
stick the candle to the wall without letting any&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:44.960
wax strip into the table but they have to come up&nbsp;
with a solution as fast as he possible can what's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:51.920
interesting is that most of the participants&nbsp;
didn't consider that the box itself could be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:59.760
used to solve the problem until their time&nbsp;
ran out and it had everything to do with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:08.160
time pressure and how the itself were presented&nbsp;
to them we can learn from this by considering&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:15.920
all the tools we have to work with but none of&nbsp;
these players realized they might be able to use&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:24.080
the tin can here to solve their problem instead&nbsp;
of looking the candy to death they could have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:33.680
used the cannon to collect their liquids and soak&nbsp;
the bottom of the candy way faster all the players&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:41.440
go back to the main room where the results of the&nbsp;
second game are announced 79 people were killed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:51.920
with 108 left standing and that's now 34.8 billion&nbsp;
own in the bank later the players will gather for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:51.920 --> 00:30:00.880
lunch time but when the last of them walk up to&nbsp;
get food they're shocked to find there's nothing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:08.640
left angry the man yells at the guard for being&nbsp;
unfair but suddenly this girl stands up and points&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:16.080
across the room telling everyone that these&nbsp;
players here cut the line to take seconds the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:24.880
man walks up to the gangster and tries to pull&nbsp;
the water out of his hand but he is overpowered&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:33.280
and the bottle shatters on the floor furious this&nbsp;
guy slaps him to the guard and starts beating him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:40.800
to death as the girls do nothing do to stop&nbsp;
him all of a sudden the scoreboard announces&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:48.960
another player has died and the total cash price&nbsp;
goes up by 100 million own a couple of guards walk&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:57.520
in to take the body away while everyone stares&nbsp;
in war realizing that this game just got a lot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:57.520 --> 00:31:04.960
more dangerous later sangu here tells his team&nbsp;
to stay awake tonight is easy they're attacked&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:11.520
the other groups are preparing for a fight but&nbsp;
guild here notices this girl across the room&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:19.360
and recognizes her as a pickpocket who stole his&nbsp;
money the man approaches and invites her to join&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:26.640
the team but she rejects his offer insisting no&nbsp;
one here can be trusted that night they all get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:35.040
into their beds and nervously wait for the guards&nbsp;
to leave the room once the lights are turned off&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:41.840
several people slowly begin to leave their courts&nbsp;
searching for an easy kill suddenly this player&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:51.280
panics as the thug grabs her and stabs the woman&nbsp;
to death this one murder causes a chain reaction&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:58.880
and all the other players begin killing each&nbsp;
other for cash june and his team tried to defend&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:05.440
themselves but vaseline here the old man begging&nbsp;
everyone to stop fighting and when the lights&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:12.640
turned back on the guards ran into the room&nbsp;
putting a stop to the madness okay this just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:20.320
might be scarier than the actual game so far there&nbsp;
are no rules or restrictions here and when you are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:28.800
literally out more dead than life everyone in this&nbsp;
room has a motive to kill you now with that said&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:35.120
this is actually the best thing that could&nbsp;
possibly happen there where a total of 27&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:41.600
players who died in the chaos and while those&nbsp;
are better odds than any of the death games so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:48.080
far this wipes out a lot of competition that we&nbsp;
would otherwise be facing in the next challenges&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:55.520
all we have to do is survive the night and the&nbsp;
other players can kill each other off for our&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:55.520 --> 00:33:02.880
direct benefit the best strategy here is to run&nbsp;
to the corner of the room and defend your position&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:10.560
with a group of friends this might seem&nbsp;
counterintuitive but when it's completely dark and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:19.520
you can't see who's coming for you being cornered&nbsp;
in like this leaves you with only 90 degrees of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:26.800
vulnerability and that's much better than being in&nbsp;
the middle of the room where you would have a full&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:34.480
360 degrees to be attacked from if you don't have&nbsp;
a group then we should be hiding under one of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:41.760
bunk beds as soon as the lights go out the killers&nbsp;
won't be able to look for anyone in hiding under&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:47.680
one of bunk beds as soon as the lights go out&nbsp;
the killers won't be able to look for anyone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:54.880
in hiding because it's too dark to see so this&nbsp;
just might be the only time i'll ever tell you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:54.880 --> 00:34:02.720
that hiding under the bed is a good idea and hey i&nbsp;
don't mind being called a coward if we end up out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:10.640
leaving everyone else as a result the next morning&nbsp;
all the players wake up but jion here notices how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:17.520
tired the old man is and finds out he stayed up&nbsp;
all night watching over the team in case someone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:25.360
attacked them he is exhausted but there's no more&nbsp;
time to rest because the third game is about to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:33.360
being the players are led into a white room where&nbsp;
they are told to divide themselves into groups of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:39.040
10 song who here realizes that a team game&nbsp;
could mean it's a physical challenge and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:45.520
things they should find stronger mean to&nbsp;
join them the group splits up to search for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:53.280
more players but with time running out they&nbsp;
only managed to bring in outcasts realizing that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:53.280 --> 00:35:01.360
three skinny women and an old man could put them&nbsp;
at a severe disadvantage the groups are taken into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:08.880
another room where they see two massive platforms&nbsp;
and they are told that today's game is tug of war&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:15.600
they'll need to pull in the rope until the other&nbsp;
team falls off the platform to their deaths and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:23.760
the guards draw lots of decide who will go first&nbsp;
when it's finally their turn jion and his team&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:31.840
stand up to see who they will be facing but find&nbsp;
that their opponents are all stronger than team&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:38.720
they are completely outmatched and no they&nbsp;
won't be able to beat them with brute force&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:46.160
but as they ride the elevator up to the platform&nbsp;
the old man tells then he knows exactly how to win&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:53.040
gluin takes a position at the front of the&nbsp;
act as leader with the strongest player at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:58.560
the very back the group stands on alternating&nbsp;
sides with their feet pointed forward and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:05.440
as soon as the game begins they all lean back&nbsp;
as far as they can using their whole body to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:12.240
pawn the rope with this technique they will able&nbsp;
to get the advantage within the first 10 seconds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:20.400
and talk the other team closer to the age but it&nbsp;
doesn't last for long their opponents gain their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:26.800
second wind and the group loses their footing&nbsp;
as their drag closer to the age of the platform&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:34.880
but that's when sung who here has a brilliant idea&nbsp;
he yells at everyone to take three steps forward&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:43.360
at his signal and with no other plan they do&nbsp;
as he sees the group steps forward knocking the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:49.680
other team of balance and it sends them tumbling&nbsp;
to the ground now with the advantage glue and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:56.320
steam is finally able to pull the others off the&nbsp;
platform and as the blade cuts through the rope&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:56.320 --> 00:37:03.120
the players call ups just happy to be alive the&nbsp;
players call ups just happy to be alive that's how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:10.800
three games they have owned and there's only&nbsp;
three more to go okay for anyone who's picked last&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:17.280
in gym class this one has got to bring back some&nbsp;
painful memories because it's immediately clear&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:24.720
that the biggest and strongest player are going&nbsp;
to dummy in this game if you are weak too old like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:31.520
these guys you are at serious risk of getting your&nbsp;
whole team killed now i am not going to say that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:39.520
they own just because they had plot arm but if i&nbsp;
were them i would be looking for every possible&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:46.160
way to cheat because of the players we have it's&nbsp;
going to be our best chance at surviving now the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:54.720
truth is this isn't just a children's game talk&nbsp;
of war used to be in the olympics from years 1900&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:54.720 --> 00:38:02.560
to 1920 and this day the international olympics&nbsp;
committee still recognizes it as an official sport&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:08.640
if this seems like treval information i assure&nbsp;
you it's not because unlike silly children's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:15.520
games and official sport has tons of rules with&nbsp;
governing bodies to make sure that the game is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:22.800
being played fairly the reason this is important&nbsp;
is because these rules are created to prevent him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:29.760
from gaining an unfair competitive advantage&nbsp;
now that doesn't put a smile on your face&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:34.960
then you are not paying attention because in&nbsp;
a death game like these unfair competitive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:41.920
advantages are everything we could possibly want&nbsp;
to stay alive in a death game official sport&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:48.240
rules are basically a gift wrapped instruction&nbsp;
manual for how to cheat and win because the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:54.640
workers are not going to be holding a training&nbsp;
camp on proper tag of war techniques and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:54.640 --> 00:39:01.680
there's no referee on this platform if we know&nbsp;
what the official rules are then it's reasonable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:08.000
to assume that we can break them without getting&nbsp;
punished for it the first rule i would break is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:15.520
called locking this is usually done by placing&nbsp;
your elbow behind your thigh and it locks up any&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:23.120
back and fourth movement in the rope normally&nbsp;
a tug of wire your hands are the only point of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:29.920
contact with the rope and it means that your&nbsp;
arms are doing a lot of work but locking helps&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:37.520
you easily use your entire body's weight to pull&nbsp;
with and this rule break makes it much harder for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:44.320
the other team to win another form of cheating is&nbsp;
for the player in the back to use what's called&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:53.120
an anchor grip where they wrap the end of the rope&nbsp;
around their torso this allows the last player to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:53.120 --> 00:40:00.080
concentrate on using his full body to pull without&nbsp;
even needing to place his hands on the rope&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:07.760
there are tons of tug of war rules that we can&nbsp;
break here that we give us an unfair advantage&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:15.360
and it's the best way for a team like this to&nbsp;
win no matter what now if we are about to lose we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:24.080
are going to need a hill mary tactic and the best&nbsp;
thing we can do is to have the whole team shift to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:32.320
one side while the player in the back ties the&nbsp;
rope to this metal ball here this doesn't violate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:38.880
any of the rules stated by the square mask and&nbsp;
if we keep pretending to pull while letting our&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:45.920
arms recover the other team will have no idea we&nbsp;
are cheating and they will blow their muscles out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:54.000
these anchors can also be used as footholds&nbsp;
instead of relying on the friction of the floor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:59.680
to push off the next morning the players are&nbsp;
brought to another room where they are giving&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:06.640
instructions for the next game they will need to&nbsp;
pair up with one other person and they have 10&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:14.000
minutes to find a partner the players immediately&nbsp;
start looking for anyone that will help them win&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:22.160
but gion here notices that they are all ignoring&nbsp;
the old man approaching him he reaches out of hand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:30.080
offering to be his partner and the two join up by&nbsp;
the end the only person who doesn't have a partner&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:36.640
is this woman and with an odd number of players&nbsp;
everyone else lives for the game while she is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:43.760
dragged away by the girls inside the arena the&nbsp;
players are laid through a room that looks like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:52.080
an old korean neighborhood and are each given a&nbsp;
pouch filled with 10 marbles and old man tells his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:52.080 --> 00:42:00.320
partner that he was good at playing with them as a&nbsp;
kid but makes him promise to be ganbu best friends&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:07.360
if he wants a chance to survive this game suddenly&nbsp;
an announcement tells the players they must use&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:13.520
the marvels to play a game of their choice and&nbsp;
take all 10 of them from their partner in order&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:21.280
to win jiang here decided to play a game of odds&nbsp;
or events and his partner has never played before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:28.080
but after only a few rounds all here manages&nbsp;
to get the better of him winning all but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:35.200
one of his marvels the man is devastated and he&nbsp;
begs his partner to help him survive asking for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:41.280
one last chance to play against the other teams to&nbsp;
take their marbles instead his partner decides to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:47.040
trust him and that's when thank you asked for&nbsp;
the man's pouch placing it under his jacket&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:54.160
he secretly switches it out which he secretly&nbsp;
switches it out with his own before stripping his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:54.160 --> 00:43:01.200
shirt to create a sling hanging his pouch around&nbsp;
the man's neck he tells him to go searching for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:07.600
others to play against and the man lives with&nbsp;
his partner gone he puts his last marble in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:15.040
pool pouch is stole and hands it over the guard&nbsp;
becoming the winner it's a filthy trick to play&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:22.880
but he did what he needed to survive meanwhile&nbsp;
guillen plays against the old man cheating in each&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:31.760
round until he's down to one less marble realizing&nbsp;
he about to lose he decides to surrender to his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:39.760
best friend and golan breaks down in tears with&nbsp;
all 10 marbles he walks away the winner as the old&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:47.520
man gets killed and with four games down there's&nbsp;
only two more to go okay this death game has a lot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:54.880
more possibilities than any of other challenges&nbsp;
because for the first time we get to choose&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:54.880 --> 00:44:02.160
how we want to play now the danger here is that&nbsp;
there's only 30 minutes on the clock and if your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:08.480
partner refuses to continue you will run out&nbsp;
of time before you have own all their marbles&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:15.600
which will get you killed playing a single all or&nbsp;
nothing round will solve this problem but it's a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:23.840
risky strategy because if you lose there's no way&nbsp;
to win your marbles back now there's guys here are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:23.840 --> 00:44:31.040
playing the game odd or even where your opponent&nbsp;
cases if the number of marbles in your hand is odd&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:39.520
or even and if they guess right they get to take&nbsp;
them winning this game is based on pure chance and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:47.040
for someone as smart as sango here he should have&nbsp;
realized that this game would give him no way to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:55.120
use a strategy to an advantage instead of games&nbsp;
of blind luck like this we should be looking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:55.120 --> 00:45:02.080
for something that your opponent thinks they&nbsp;
can win but that you know you can win and for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:02.080 --> 00:45:08.640
that there's nothing better than an unsigned&nbsp;
chinese game called neem this game has been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:15.200
around for countries but what makes it special&nbsp;
is that there's actually a proven strategy to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:22.720
guarantee a victory if you are not familiar with&nbsp;
the game this is how to play first we combine our&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:30.240
20 marbles together into a shared pile and take&nbsp;
turns removing either one or two marbles at a time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:37.120
whoever removes the last marvel gets to keep all&nbsp;
of them and wins the game it's so simple that you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:44.800
would think there couldn't possibly be a strategy&nbsp;
here but the key to this game is to always go&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:51.440
first and remove exactly two marbles then whatever&nbsp;
they remove you remove the opposite for example&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:58.240
if they remove two marbles then you remove one&nbsp;
and if they remove one marble then you remove two&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:58.240 --> 00:46:05.840
if we keep this going then you are guaranteed to&nbsp;
remove the last marble and you will never lose&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:05.840 --> 00:46:12.720
most people don't know this mathematical trick&nbsp;
exist and that's why it is perfect game to choose&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:20.160
in the situation because when our victory depends&nbsp;
on another players comparison we can use name to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:27.520
trick anyone into agreeing to play and they won't&nbsp;
realize they have lost until it's too late now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:34.720
it might be that there's just now enough time to&nbsp;
invest in playing a full game of nim because the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:42.160
longer it takes your opponent to make decisions&nbsp;
the more he puts you at risk of getting executed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:49.360
if that's the case then we should follow these&nbsp;
guys dirty tactics and steal our partners marbles&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:56.800
to do this we should ask for their pouch in order&nbsp;
to set up the game but once they have handed them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:56.800 --> 00:47:04.080
over just go straight to the guard and declare you&nbsp;
have made the win conditions the other player will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:10.000
probably attack you in protest but violence is&nbsp;
not allowed in this game and your opponent will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:17.520
be threatened at gunpoint if he does once you&nbsp;
have his marvels there's nothing to stop you from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:25.440
winning and in a death game like this we have&nbsp;
to consider every tactic at our disposal if we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:33.360
want to stay alive and victor's return to the main&nbsp;
room and they are all surprised to see that this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:40.720
woman is still alive she explains that since she&nbsp;
had no one to pair with the game let her skip the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:46.720
challenge and after everything they have been&nbsp;
through the others are furious the next morning&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:55.520
all the players wake up to a group of girls coming&nbsp;
in with a coffin and gion here realizes that one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:55.520 --> 00:48:03.360
of their fellow players decided to quit during the&nbsp;
night looking up they watch the man's life turns&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:10.240
into cold hard cash and that's when the pa&nbsp;
announces that the fifth game is about to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:17.760
begin the group is taken to a room with a royal&nbsp;
mannequins wearing numbered vests and they are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:25.920
told they each choose one for their next challenge&nbsp;
rushing in everyone gets their pick but when jian&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:33.040
finally step up to choose the only best left for&nbsp;
him are numbers 1 and 16. he considers taking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:39.920
number one even though that means he will go first&nbsp;
but this player asked to have the number instead&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:39.920 --> 00:48:47.520
and he agrees to let him take it finally they&nbsp;
are brought into the game room and the announcer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:54.560
tells them they will be playing glasses taping&nbsp;
stones they must remove their shoes and walk over&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:54.560 --> 00:49:02.640
tempered glass to make it across the bridge but&nbsp;
if they step on a panel made from regular glass&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:11.440
they will fall to their death with 60 minutes on&nbsp;
the clock the first player takes off his shoes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:19.120
and approaches the breeze nervous he jumps to the&nbsp;
first tile and makes it but when he moves on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:19.120 --> 00:49:25.680
second the man falls straight through the glass&nbsp;
horrified the other players have no choice but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:33.200
to continue and more people start crossing the&nbsp;
glass breeze one by one they plummet to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:39.040
ground as they slowly reveal a path of stable&nbsp;
panels for the others to follow with the first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:46.160
eight players dead it's now the gangster's&nbsp;
turn to lead the group but he refuses to move&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:52.800
on telling the others to go before him if they&nbsp;
want to pass everyone behind him starts to panic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:59.120
they still have five panels left and are quickly&nbsp;
running out to time suddenly the gangster comes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:59.120 --> 00:50:07.760
face to face with this woman and she mocks him&nbsp;
for being a coward jumping onto his platforms she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:08.320 --> 00:50:15.840
locks her arm around him threatening to pull him&nbsp;
off the ledge if he doesn't continue but before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:15.840 --> 00:50:23.680
the gangster knows it they break through the glass&nbsp;
panel as they both fall to their deaths with only&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:31.760
a handful of survivors and least then three&nbsp;
minutes left this man crouches down to inspect the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:39.600
panel in front of him son who begs him to keep on&nbsp;
moving but he reveals that he was a glassmaker for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:45.920
30 years and can tell which panels are tempered&nbsp;
from the reflection the man jumps towards onto&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:52.800
a stable panel and they realizes his theory is&nbsp;
working but that's when the game decides to make&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:58.160
things more challenging and turns off the light&nbsp;
so they can't tell the difference panicking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:58.160 --> 00:51:05.680
sango here realizes they won't be able to see the&nbsp;
reflections anymore but the glass maker has one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:05.680 --> 00:51:12.800
last trick up his sleeve he asked for something&nbsp;
to throw out the panels explaining that tempered&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:19.360
and regular glass make different sound given&nbsp;
here passes over the marble he still has and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:19.360 --> 00:51:26.160
the glass maker tosses in front of them but with&nbsp;
the less than 25 seconds remaining sangu decides&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:34.080
to take matters into his own hands he pushes the&nbsp;
man forward shattering the glass into pieces and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:34.080 --> 00:51:41.600
with the path clear they all make it to the other&nbsp;
side when the timer hits zero the remaining glass&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:41.600 --> 00:51:48.720
panels suddenly explode and the shades go flying&nbsp;
through the air injuring the three survivors that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:48.720 --> 00:51:57.280
sound five games down and one more to go okay this&nbsp;
glass maker was a total badass he could have saved&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:57.280 --> 00:52:04.240
all 16 players if he shared his knowledge in the&nbsp;
beginning but he knew that keeping his mouth shut&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:09.680
would eliminate his competition and it was&nbsp;
a better move the only mistake he made was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:15.040
not waiting longer because once he revealed&nbsp;
his strategy the game removed his advantage&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:15.040 --> 00:52:23.520
and all it took was one greedy man to kill him off&nbsp;
now having said that this game is different from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:29.360
the previous challenges because it's not a test&nbsp;
of skill or strength when you have no information&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:29.360 --> 00:52:37.520
to base your decision on choosing the right path&nbsp;
here makes a game a random chance if you look here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:37.520 --> 00:52:48.240
you will see that there are 18 pairs of panels so&nbsp;
this first player has a one in 262 144 chance of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:56.960
making it across this breeze this is basically a&nbsp;
death game lottery with odds that i wouldn't play&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:56.960 --> 00:53:06.720
under any circumstances unless i found a way to&nbsp;
cheat by the few of advantages it's fair to assume&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:14.080
that each player will probably step on two panels&nbsp;
before dying with one correct guess and one wrong&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:14.080 --> 00:53:21.040
one that means on average nine players will need&nbsp;
to die in order to cross all 18 of them if the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:21.040 --> 00:53:28.160
majority of the players are going to die then it&nbsp;
might be the perfect time to convince them to vote&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:28.160 --> 00:53:34.800
on leaving the competition this game is like&nbsp;
telling someone that if they don't win the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:43.520
lottery they will get murdered and when you put it&nbsp;
like that it's kind of ridiculous that the first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:43.520 --> 00:53:50.640
players even attempt to play now if we actually&nbsp;
choose to play the horse we are going to have to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:58.560
cheat if we want any chance of making it to the&nbsp;
next round i am not expert glass maker like this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:58.560 --> 00:54:06.400
guy here but all i need to know is that if you&nbsp;
throw something through window it's going to break&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:06.400 --> 00:54:13.760
that's exactly why i would have collected these&nbsp;
shoes here take my jacket off and tie a knot at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:13.760 --> 00:54:23.120
the end of the sleeve then place a bunch of shoes&nbsp;
inside so that we can swing it in front of us to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:23.120 --> 00:54:31.440
test if the glass will break or not if it crack&nbsp;
then i jump to the opposite panel and continue&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:39.120
until i reach the end if for some reason this&nbsp;
method fails we can also try working on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:45.520
metal bars here instead of the glass now this&nbsp;
might be considered unacceptable to the game&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:45.520 --> 00:54:53.760
designers but if someone doesn't try it will&nbsp;
never know if it's allowed or not the only win&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:53.760 --> 00:54:59.680
condition for this challenge is to make it across&nbsp;
the bridge and we have already seen others game&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:59.680 --> 00:55:06.720
where the players are able to manipulate the rules&nbsp;
to their advantage if you remember in the last&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:06.720 --> 00:55:13.600
game jango him the marvels instead of playing&nbsp;
for them and when things get desperate these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:13.600 --> 00:55:22.000
are the kind of tactics that we need to start&nbsp;
using if we don't test the boundaries of what's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:28.800
allowed in each and every game then we might&nbsp;
be missing out on some of the best strategies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:34.640
that will keep us alive for longer and it's a&nbsp;
terrible waste of an opportunity later the players&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:34.640 --> 00:55:42.480
are rewarded for surviving to the final game and&nbsp;
given the first real foot they have had in days&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:42.480 --> 00:55:50.560
starving the men dig into their stake realizing&nbsp;
this could be the last meal of their lives when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:50.560 --> 00:55:58.080
they finishes eating the stuff leave them with&nbsp;
their steak knives and by all appearances this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:58.080 --> 00:56:04.640
next game is going to be a visual fight to the&nbsp;
death that tonight jion here decides to approach&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:04.640 --> 00:56:10.880
the girl to talk he asked her what she will do if&nbsp;
she survives and the girl reveals she wants to get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:10.880 --> 00:56:18.720
her mother out of north korea so their families&nbsp;
can reunite it's a touchy moment but suddenly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:19.760 --> 00:56:26.160
looks over the notice the other players splouching&nbsp;
in his bed he's falling asleep and the man&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:26.160 --> 00:56:33.280
realizes he's got the perfect opportunity to kill&nbsp;
him pulling out his steak knife he is about to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:40.640
step forward when the girl stops him insisting&nbsp;
he shouldn't play this way he hesitates but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:40.640 --> 00:56:48.960
the man knows she is right and puts the knife away&nbsp;
that's when he hears the girl gasping and turns&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:48.960 --> 00:56:56.720
around shocked to find her leaning over the bed&nbsp;
and realizing she was injured by the flying glass&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:56.720 --> 00:57:04.560
in the last game worried he runs over the front&nbsp;
door and screams at the staff to treat her owned&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:04.560 --> 00:57:11.680
to his surprise the light suddenly turned on as&nbsp;
the workers entered the room carrying a coffin but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:17.760
they aren't here to help green looks behind&nbsp;
him and sees sango standing over the girl's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:26.240
bed and his knife is soaked in her blood furious&nbsp;
jion goes to attack him but a guard intervenes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:26.240 --> 00:57:33.920
shoving the player to the ground and as he screams&nbsp;
in fury the coffin closes over the woman's body&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:33.920 --> 00:57:40.000
leaving the final two players left with one&nbsp;
last game okay this was devastating but we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:46.720
all should have seen it coming sango here has&nbsp;
managed to stay alive because he's the most&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:46.720 --> 00:57:53.120
cold-blooded player in the game but that's&nbsp;
why he was 100 correct to kill this woman he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:53.120 --> 00:58:01.440
realizes that with three players left there was&nbsp;
a huge risk that if the others banded together&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:01.440 --> 00:58:08.720
they would have a majority using the third clause&nbsp;
of the contract this will let them force abort to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:08.720 --> 00:58:15.840
quite the game and he wouldn't be able to stop&nbsp;
them if they were me i wouldn't let that happen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:15.840 --> 00:58:22.480
under any circumstances because we have come&nbsp;
away too far to give up now that's why he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:22.480 --> 00:58:29.040
took matters due to his own hands before it&nbsp;
got that far and it was a brilliant move to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:29.040 --> 00:58:35.040
make now to be fair this girl was already bleeding&nbsp;
out and was simply not strong enough to compete&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:35.040 --> 00:58:43.840
at the next game her only options were to kill the&nbsp;
men during the night or to force a vote and return&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:43.840 --> 00:58:51.680
back to the mainland both of this benefit nobody&nbsp;
but herself and jion here seems to keep forgetting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:51.680 --> 00:59:01.040
that he is a finalist in a death game saying you&nbsp;
just did him a huge favor and wiped out 33 of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:01.040 --> 00:59:08.080
competition so as heartless and cold-blooded&nbsp;
as it was the man did exactly what he had to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:08.080 --> 00:59:17.040
do the two men are taken to a corridor where their&nbsp;
trendy coin will be flipped to decide who will be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:17.040 --> 00:59:22.880
defending or attacking picking triangle gun&nbsp;
here wins the toss and chooses to play offense&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:22.880 --> 00:59:28.720
before the players are finally told that for&nbsp;
the last round they will be playing squid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:28.720 --> 00:59:36.960
game as the attacker blue must enter the squid&nbsp;
shaped coat and tap his foot inside a circle&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:36.960 --> 00:59:44.880
on the other end to win the defender wins if he&nbsp;
manages to toss the attacker out of the court but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:44.880 --> 00:59:51.600
any kind of violence is allowed and the last&nbsp;
person standing will be the winner suddenly the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:51.600 --> 00:59:57.680
sky goes dark and it starts to rain as the two&nbsp;
players take their positions determined to get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:58.320 --> 01:00:05.920
visions for the girl journey here works towards&nbsp;
his childhood friend and starts swinging his knife&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:14.160
but the other player manages to get him in a choke&nbsp;
hold the two men go at it and as the player get&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:22.640
locked into a wrestling match his opponent picks&nbsp;
up his knife before stabbing glenn deep into the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:30.640
thigh he kicks the other player away from him but&nbsp;
with his injuries he can barely defend himself the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:37.440
man walks up to him and tries to end his life but&nbsp;
jion won't give up catching the knife at the last&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:45.520
second and bites his ankle forcing the man to back&nbsp;
off exhausted he climbs over his friend and beats&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:52.720
him into the ground xango is too weak to continue&nbsp;
and even though he has the perfect opportunity&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:52.720 --> 01:01:00.800
to kill him jan spares his life getting on to his&nbsp;
feet he asked the guard about clause number three&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:08.320
and if they are still allowed to end the game if&nbsp;
both players agree to quit he then offers a hand&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:15.920
to his friend telling him they can both go home&nbsp;
but the man decides to sacrifice himself letting&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:25.760
june win by default he's completed all six games&nbsp;
and on 45 billion own but has just lost his friend&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:34.320
in the process okay sango took the honorable way&nbsp;
out but to be fair this guy had it coming to his&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:41.360
because he was just about the host childhood&nbsp;
friend you have ever asked for first of all he&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:48.480
tricked jian into picking an umbrella in the&nbsp;
second game knowing that it might get him killed&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:56.560
and he also stole his other teammates marvel&nbsp;
which was downright disrespectful having said that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:56.560 --> 01:02:04.480
we cannot get emotional like jion here because&nbsp;
this kind of behavior will backfire on you quickly&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:11.920
he's furious that song who killed the girl but&nbsp;
it's distracting him from his priorities of&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:21.920
staying alive and finding strategies to win this&nbsp;
last game now if the man had kept his cool he&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:29.520
would have noticed that all the walls of&nbsp;
the room were images that told him exactly&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:36.400
what the next game would be these pictures&nbsp;
have been here the whole time and if glenn&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:43.680
had noticed this drawing of the squid game court&nbsp;
with only two players inside with that kind of&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:51.200
evidence all you need to know is how to play squid&nbsp;
game to figure out what tactics will give us our&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:59.280
best chance to win so let's break down how this&nbsp;
game actually works first there are two sides and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:06.880
offense and a defense the attacking players begin&nbsp;
the game by trying to run across the court here&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:14.960
while the defender tries to stop them if they&nbsp;
succeed the game enters stage two and the attacker&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:21.760
must run through this narrow gap and break the&nbsp;
defense but only wins by tapping his foot on&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:29.440
his tiny space lastly if he gets pushed out of&nbsp;
bounds by the defender that he losses now that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:37.200
you know the rules imagine if you are the attacker&nbsp;
trying to run through this gap except this time&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:46.080
the defending player here is holding out a stack&nbsp;
knife this is why choosing to play offense is a&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:51.440
terrible strategy because they are actually not&nbsp;
playing squid game at all they are playing a new&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:59.600
game called kill your childhood friend and in fact&nbsp;
that they are both given stick knives completely&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:06.960
changes how we should be thinking about this to&nbsp;
put it another way if sumo wrestlers were allowed&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:12.800
to use stick knives in competition they would&nbsp;
have to completely change their regular strategies&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:20.400
in how to play and win the scenario jion has to&nbsp;
make it through this tiny opening without getting&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:27.440
stabbed but all sango has to do is push him out&nbsp;
of the court or kill him choosing the defender is&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:34.240
going to give you a better chance to win because&nbsp;
the knife makes it almost impossible to enter the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:41.440
gap without getting seriously injured if i wear&nbsp;
him i would even try standing where the opponent&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:50.160
is supposed to tap his foot this loose the&nbsp;
attacker closes to the aid of the court here and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:58.640
we might be able to throw him out of bounds to win&nbsp;
the game it doesn't require nearly as much energy&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:06.080
agility or endurance as the offensive player&nbsp;
needs to have and that's why guild made the worst&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:11.760
possible choice now this is not the only mistake&nbsp;
that he made because even while the game was being&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:18.320
played he was so caught up in gaining revenge&nbsp;
that he completely forgot the main objective&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:18.320 --> 01:05:24.960
this man had several opportunities to run through&nbsp;
the gap and tap his foot on the circle to win but&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:32.240
he completely ignored it and continued fighting&nbsp;
its the game problem he had at the beginning with&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:32.240 --> 01:05:39.440
a dog to player because when he finally owned&nbsp;
and flipped the paper he was so caught up with&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:45.920
his emotions that he wanted to return the slap&nbsp;
and forgot that he was playing for one hundred&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:45.920 --> 01:05:55.520
thousand own its jian's host character flaw and it&nbsp;
nearly cost him his life he is taken back to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:55.520 --> 01:06:03.280
mainland and dubbed on a sidewalk with a special&nbsp;
debit card as a reward when he puts it into an atm&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:10.960
he discovers it's full of the prize money from the&nbsp;
death game one year later june here is miserable&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:18.000
and hasn't touched any of the money he owned but&nbsp;
as he sitting on a riverbank a woman asked him&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:26.640
to buy one of her flowers because they while he&nbsp;
pays for a single rose and she gives it to him&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:35.040
but then he discovers an envelope was added to it&nbsp;
with a pink ribbon opening it he finds out it's a&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:42.960
squid game business card for the old man invited&nbsp;
him to a reunion in the city going to the address&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:50.880
he enters his building and is shocked to find that&nbsp;
the old man lying in a gurney he's somehow still&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:50.880 --> 01:06:58.480
alive and glean demands an explanation about who&nbsp;
he is and old man tells him he created the dead&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:58.480 --> 01:07:06.720
games and the only reason he joined was so that&nbsp;
he could feel like a kid again dion is completely&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:13.600
disgusted but the old man dies before he can&nbsp;
answer any more of his questions several days and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:20.640
