00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:01.390
Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:05.649
Today I'm going to explain an action, adventure,
and drama film called “The Man In The Iron

00:00:05.649 --> 00:00:06.649
Mask."

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:07.660
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:09.400
Watch out and take care.&nbsp;

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.510
&nbsp;
In the 17th century, Paris is in chaos as

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:13.960
riots against the King continue to emerge.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.700
As a consequence, rioters are bound to prison
to suffer a slow death because of hunger.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:22.100
Among the prisoners is a mysterious inmate;
his name is unknown, so he comes by the alias

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.690
“the man in the iron mask.”

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:28.830
As the chaos continues, the captain of the
musketeers, D’Artagnan, patrols the streets

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.010
of the town, but the angry citizens throw
rocks at him because he still serves the King.

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.700
He used to be one of the four musketeers,
but the group has separated ways.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:42.740
Porthos has become a womanizing drunkard,
while Aramis has become a priest.

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:46.010
The two of them live together despite their
very opposite lifestyles.

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.469
Porthos disturbs Aramis in prayer, resulting
in an argument, just as D’Artagnan enters

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:50.510
the room.

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.700
Both of them are delighted to see him, but
he informs his two former colleagues that

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.770
he comes in the name of the King, who wishes
to summon Porthos and Aramis immediately.

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:04.580
The fourth musketeer, Athos, peacefully lives
with his only son, Raoul, who also aspires

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.030
to be a musketeer.

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.880
He entrusts his wife’s ring for Raoul to
propose with it to his love interest.&nbsp;

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.080
&nbsp;
France is under the reign of King Louis the

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.200
14th, a militaristic leader who enjoys grandeurs.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.550
While going about his day of preparing a battle
plan for war, one of his chief advisers, Pierre,

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:22.610
informs him that riots are happening in the
city.

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.520
Pierre adds that the people are starving and
that they could distribute the food reserved

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.250
for the army as a solution.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.040
At that moment, Aramis responds to the King’s
call and arrives at the palace.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.369
King Louis welcomes him and informs the former
musketeer that he wants him to find out who

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:37.640
the secret leader of the Jesuits is, someone
who is a threat to the people’s loyalty

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:38.850
to the crown.

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.009
King Louis adds that when Aramis finds out
the leader’s identity, he must kill him

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:43.549
in the name of God and France.

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:47.640
Hesitantly, Aramis accepts the mission, knowing
that he might end up in an unfortunate situation

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.240
if he refuses.&nbsp;

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.790
&nbsp;
The King shifts his attention to Pierre’s

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.900
concerns about the people rioting for food.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.850
As a solution, he orders Pierre to send them
rotten food.

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.439
At the palace festival, Raoul is joined by
Christine Bellefort, the woman he intends

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:01.450
to marry.

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.490
The King gets a glimpse of the couple from
the palace window and asks for the woman’s

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:05.490
name.

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.620
Christine’s beauty captivates the King,
and just as Raoul is about to propose, they

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:10.549
are interrupted by a game hosted by the King.

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:14.749
A piglet is brought for the guests to catch,
where the winner’s prize is a piece of jewelry.

00:02:14.749 --> 00:02:18.330
Everyone participates in the game, but Christine
fails to join as she is trapped in the nearby

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.150
garden because of the fountains.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.450
The one behind the fountains being set off
is King Louis, who sees the game as a perfect

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.730
opportunity to talk to the beautiful lady.

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.069
Christine looks around the palace, searching
for another exit when King Louis sneaks from

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:31.109
behind and opens a conversation.

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:34.560
From a distance, D’Artagnan is secretly
listening to their conversation.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.790
King Louis confesses his interest in Christine,
but she lets the King know that she loves

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.049
Raoul and is faithfully committed to him,
but the King pays no attention to what she

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:42.809
says and proceeds to kiss her.

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:46.739
However, D’Artagnan pushes the pig toward
their direction to interrupt the moment.

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:50.779
Out of nowhere, a spy runs from behind and
attempts to assassinate the King; luckily,

00:02:50.779 --> 00:02:55.049
D’Artagnan is under strict supervision and
manages to throw his sword, killing the spy.

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:57.159
Raoul rescues Christine from the scene, and
they flee.&nbsp;

00:02:57.159 --> 00:03:00.939
&nbsp;
Queen Anne, the King’s mother, is a very

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:04.989
religious woman; she visits the chapel as
often as she can and says her prayers.

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:08.749
That day, she passes by D’Artagnan’s room
to personally express her gratitude for saving

00:03:08.749 --> 00:03:10.030
her son’s life.

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.230
The conversation briefly ends after the musketeer
humbly says that it is simply his job.

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.129
Moments later, he is informed that Raoul has
withdrawn his request to join the musketeers,

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:20.389
which raises suspicions in D’Artagnan.

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:23.669
He visits Athos in his home to seek answers,
where they happily embrace each other after

00:03:23.669 --> 00:03:25.870
not seeing each other for a long time.

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.169
While they drink wine together, Raoul enters
in a melancholic mood.

00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:32.439
His father comes to ask him what is wrong,
but he returns the ring and informs him that

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:35.089
the proposal is cancelled because he is sent
back to the battlefront.

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:38.570
Athos suspects that the King has arranged
the assignment of Raoul back to war so that

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:40.949
he could have Christine all to himself.

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:44.969
Accepting his fate, Raoul walks up to his
room as Athos gets agitated about D’Artagnan

00:03:44.969 --> 00:03:46.919
remaining loyal to the greedy King.&nbsp;

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:48.650
&nbsp;
At the palace, a commotion happens as the

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.730
people of Paris attack the musketeers all
over the city for distributing rotten food.

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.889
Some musketeers get beaten, and some run back
to the gates for refuge.

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:59.939
D’Artagnan instructs them to hold fire as
he makes his way outside to talk to the people.

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:03.609
They yell at him, refusing to listen to any
word he says, as they know that he is a king’s

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:04.609
officer.

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:07.969
An apple and a tomato are thrown at him, but
he successfully slices and catches it with

00:04:07.969 --> 00:04:09.199
his sword mid-air.

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:12.769
This gains the people’s attention and respect,
making them listen to him.

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:15.769
He assures the townsfolk that he will speak
to the King himself and bring up the issue

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:16.769
about food.

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:20.650
The people return to town in an orderly manner,
and D’Artagnan makes his way to a secret

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:23.710
passage to inform the King that fresh food
should be given to the people.

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.060
On a personal note, he asks about Christine
and his intentions toward her; King Louis

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.300
annoyingly replies that he is still King and
the one in charge despite being a young king.

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.639
After the meeting, King Louis assigns a new
chief advisor and orders Pierre to be killed

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:37.330
after distributing rotten food, which was
his order.

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.389
He also reminds them that he gives them the
authority to shoot the people who participate

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:41.389
in riots.&nbsp;

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:43.500
&nbsp;
The day of battle begins, where Raoul fights

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:44.740
at the front.

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.150
Before advancing to the enemy’s headquarters,
he hands a letter to another officer and kindly

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.460
asks him to take it to the royal dispatches.

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.900
As he leads the ground troops, a dutch cannon
fires right at the moment, resulting in his

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.020
instant death.

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.800
Meanwhile, a letter is slipped on Christine’s
door.&nbsp;

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.520
She opens the letter and reads that Raoul
has sadly died.

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.759
The news breaks her into tears, as well as
Athos, who receives the same news.

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:08.180
His son's death sends him into a fit of rage,
making him go to the palace to confront the

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:09.180
King.

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.460
D’Artagnan sees his friend and proceeds
to calm him down, but Athos fights him and

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.439
the other musketeers around.

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:17.979
To control the commotion, D’Artagnan knocks
him to the ground, begging him not to act

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:20.729
insanely after the tragedy experienced by
his son.

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:24.319
This puts a strain on their friendship; Athos
walks away after calling D’Artagnan a traitor

00:05:24.319 --> 00:05:26.360
for siding with his son’s killer.&nbsp;

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.240
&nbsp;
In the palace, King Louis invites Christine

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.819
to have a romantic dinner.

00:05:29.819 --> 00:05:32.740
Despite all the grandeur, Christine’s heart
is filled with grief and sadness after the

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:34.070
death of Raoul.

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:37.150
She could not bring herself to take a single
bite of her food, but the King comforts her

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:39.940
by saying that he only desires her comfort
and happiness.

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:43.379
To seduce Christine, King Louis brings her
into a room, but she hesitates to give him

00:05:43.379 --> 00:05:44.430
what he wants.

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:48.320
Finally, the King manages to get into her
mind and make her give in to his desires;

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:52.020
that night, they share an intimate moment
as she spends the night in the palace.&nbsp;

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:53.500
&nbsp;
In a secret mission assigned by the King to

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.639
Aramis, he gathers his former colleagues to
have a secret meeting.

00:05:56.639 --> 00:06:00.409
He explains that the Jesuits are against King
Louis’ wars and the starvation of the people.

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:04.060
Additionally, he says that the King has ordered
him to kill the leader of the Jesuits, but

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:08.020
the thing is, he is the Jesuit's secret leader
and has a plan to depose King Louis.

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:11.680
His three friends look at him in utter disbelief,
but Athos and Porthos agree to take part in

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:12.790
his plans.

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:16.870
D’Artagnan, on the other hand, stands by
his oath to be of service to the crown.

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:20.490
Athos despises him for being loyal to a dishonorable
king and threatens him with death should they

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:21.620
ever meet again.

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:25.430
Back in the palace, King Louis informs D’Artagnan
that the three former musketeers are missing

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:28.560
and asks if he thinks that his friends are
a threat to the crown.

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:31.770
Subtly defending his friends, D’Artagnan
does all he can to drive the King’s attention

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:34.430
away from them, but he orders him to track
them down.

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:38.030
The dilemma of staying loyal to service or
his friendship stresses D’Artagnan out,

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:40.169
leaving him clueless on his next course of
action.

00:06:40.169 --> 00:06:42.461
&nbsp;
During a full moon, the man in the iron mask

00:06:42.461 --> 00:06:46.330
longingly looks at the sky, wondering when
he can witness the great outdoors freely.

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:49.770
In the island prison, the three former musketeers
sneak in with disguises.

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:53.259
Aramis manages to enter after pretending to
be an Italian priest.

00:06:53.259 --> 00:06:56.849
He carries a corpse in a similar iron mask
inside his ample cloak to replace the prisoner

00:06:56.849 --> 00:06:57.849
with.

00:06:57.849 --> 00:07:00.360
He alerts the guard that the man in the iron
mask has been plague-infested.

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:04.749
This urges the guard to act quickly and burn
the body before it could further infect anyone.

00:07:04.749 --> 00:07:07.610
Aramis carefully makes his way out of the
prison while carrying the real man in the

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:09.020
iron mask with him.

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:11.940
The group safely docks their boat into shore
and makes their way to a safe house in the

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:12.940
countryside.

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:16.340
In an attempt to reveal the man’s identity,
they unmask him and find out that the man

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:19.819
behind the mask is the King’s identical
twin brother, Philippe.

00:07:19.819 --> 00:07:23.900
Athos assists him to a room where Philippe
tells him that he used to live in a farmhouse

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:27.629
when people took him into prison and has been
bound to an iron mask since then.

00:07:27.629 --> 00:07:30.639
Two men enter the room two clean Philippe
and fix his appearance.

00:07:30.639 --> 00:07:34.069
The three of them watch him in complete disbelief
and amazement when he enters the kitchen,

00:07:34.069 --> 00:07:35.509
looking like the King himself.

00:07:35.509 --> 00:07:39.729
Aramis finally reveals to him his true identity;
his mother, Queen Anne, gave birth to twins,

00:07:39.729 --> 00:07:43.949
and their father, King Louis the 13th, made
one of them disappear to avoid dynastic warfare

00:07:43.949 --> 00:07:45.380
between his sons.

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:48.909
His father ordered Philippe’s true identity
hidden; only on his death day did he reveal

00:07:48.909 --> 00:07:51.229
to Queen Anne and King Louis about Philippe.

00:07:51.229 --> 00:07:54.800
As a mother, the Queen wanted to restore Philippe's
birthright, but the greedy King imprisoned

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:58.409
him to preserve his power and put him in the
iron mask to conceal his identity, an act

00:07:58.409 --> 00:08:00.080
that Aramis executed.

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:04.039
Regretful about it, Aramis asks for forgiveness
and wishes to redeem himself by replacing

00:08:04.039 --> 00:08:06.169
Louis with the more benevolent Philippe.

00:08:06.169 --> 00:08:09.889
Porthos and Athos contradict his plan, saying
that it is too dangerous, but Philippe fails

00:08:09.889 --> 00:08:11.270
to answer just yet.

00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:14.779
In the palace, King Louis receives the news
about his brother through a letter.

00:08:14.779 --> 00:08:18.080
He orders his servants to let his mother know
of the tragic fate experienced by his twin

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:20.620
before opening a box where the iron mask lies.

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:23.419
He is filled with horror after looking at
it and imagining what it is like to live a

00:08:23.419 --> 00:08:24.620
masked life.

00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:27.550
The Queen runs to the chapel to express her
grief in front of the altar.

00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:30.569
For comfort, D'Artagnan approaches and offers
her his embrace.

00:08:30.569 --> 00:08:33.970
It is revealed that the two used to have an
affair until the musketeer has chosen to remain

00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:34.970
loyal to the crown.&nbsp;

00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:37.010
&nbsp;
For the following days, the group encourages

00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:40.909
Philippe to take part in their plan, but he
refuses to pretend to be anyone else.

00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:44.829
He wants to have complete freedom in his life,
including choosing to be who he wants to be.

00:08:44.829 --> 00:08:49.060
Eventually, he agrees after realizing that
he wants to share a common goal with the musketeers,

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:52.050
which is to aspire to a better country to
serve the people rightfully.

00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:55.620
The three tutor Philippe on courtly life,
including how to combat, dress, and act like

00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:56.720
the King.

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:58.980
His days are filled with lessons that the
group patiently teaches.&nbsp;

00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:01.540
&nbsp;
Meanwhile, Christine is living a majestic

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:03.360
life after living with the King.

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:06.670
While she gets ready for an event, her servant
brings her a letter, which she finds out is

00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:07.870
from Raoul.

00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:10.829
He wrote the letter predicting his death for
being sent to battle and telling Christine

00:09:10.829 --> 00:09:13.050
that he forgives her for being the King’s
mistress.

00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:17.220
Tearfully, she reflects on his words and suspects
the King for orchestrating Raoul’s death.

00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:20.550
He confronts King Louis about it that night,
but he dismisses her thoughts and acts indifferent

00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:21.550
toward her feelings.&nbsp;

00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:23.540
&nbsp;
Aramis leaves for the palace and seeks to

00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:24.940
talk to Queen Anne.

00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:28.570
In a confessional, he informs the Queen that
there is still hope for the poor Philippe.

00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:31.279
Her eyes fill with hope after hearing the
words of Aramis.

00:09:31.279 --> 00:09:34.620
Days later, the palace hosts a masquerade
ball, where guests are dressed in elegant

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:36.519
attires as they dance.

00:09:36.519 --> 00:09:40.630
Aramis, Porthos, Athos, and Philippe disguise
themselves as guests at the party, waiting

00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:43.100
for the perfect opportunity to plot their
mission.

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:46.550
King Louis sees a guest in an iron mask for
a split second and is disturbed by the sight

00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:47.550
of it.

00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:51.620
As he continues dancing, he sees the iron
mask once again, which is held by Aramis.

00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:55.910
Repeatedly, he sees the mask, which sends
him to his room after not feeling well.

00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:59.040
The group uses the secret passages to get
to the King’s room quickly, where he lays

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:00.070
in bed.

00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:03.850
He turns to see the three musketeers approaching,
and he is knocked unconscious.

00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:07.279
Moments later, he gains consciousness back
and sees Philippe along with the group.

00:10:07.279 --> 00:10:11.529
Their clothes are exchanged, and Porthos restrains
him by tying his mouth and covering his head.

00:10:11.529 --> 00:10:15.389
Nervously, Philippe makes his way back to
the party, all dressed as the King, while

00:10:15.389 --> 00:10:18.790
Athos looks at him proudly and starts to develop
paternal feelings toward him.

00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:21.800
Philippe walks to the throne in the ballroom
and feels powerful for the first time in his

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:23.070
life.

00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:26.380
Suspicions grow among the people as he helps
one guest up after tripping in front of him,

00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:27.730
revealing his good nature.

00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:30.600
Queen Anne dramatically makes her entrance
to the party, and Philippe sees her for the

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:31.769
first time.

00:10:31.769 --> 00:10:35.209
They subtly express their happiness to reunite
again, and the Queen’s maid shares the joy

00:10:35.209 --> 00:10:37.050
of knowing that Philippe is alive.

00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:40.290
D’Artagnan realizes something is amiss;
he checks the King’s room and heads back

00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:41.800
to the ballroom to check on him.

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:45.320
Out of nowhere, Christine disrupts the party
by calling the King a murderer and accusing

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:47.910
him of being responsible for Raoul’s death.

00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:51.310
Instead of punishing her, he orders the guards
to lay hands off her; he further asks for

00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:53.579
forgiveness and promises to make amends.

00:10:53.579 --> 00:10:56.880
The unexpected response from the King raises
suspicions in D’Artagnan and orders all

00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:59.110
palace musketeers to be on full alert.

00:10:59.110 --> 00:11:02.519
He instructs Philippe to follow him to the
underground dock, to which he refuses, but

00:11:02.519 --> 00:11:04.889
D’artagnan insists, so he follows.

00:11:04.889 --> 00:11:08.740
Meanwhile, the three musketeers make their
way to the port where their boat awaits.

00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:11.959
Before they could leave, palace musketeers
start attacking them, but they successfully

00:11:11.959 --> 00:11:13.170
get rid of them.

00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:17.010
Their expertise in battle has not faded after
all these years, but unfortunately, the gate

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:18.790
closes before them and the boat.

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:22.410
The musketeers led by D’Artagnan now outnumber
the group; they take a moment to look at each

00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:24.120
other and reflect on their friendship.

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:27.970
Athos holds King Louis and frees him of the
sack, revealing that the King has a twin.

00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:31.320
The men decide to trade for the brothers'
lives; however, Philippe is re-captured in

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:33.279
the ensuing chaos of their escape.

00:11:33.279 --> 00:11:37.869
As the three musketeers are able to sail away,
Philippe’s life is in danger once again.&nbsp;

00:11:37.869 --> 00:11:39.780
&nbsp;
Inside the palace, King Louis observes Philippe’s

00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:43.450
appearance and tells Athos that the man standing
before him is not an impostor but his twin

00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:44.450
instead.

00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:48.639
The Queen enters the room and embraces Philippe,
which puts King Louis in a state of jealousy.

00:11:48.639 --> 00:11:52.250
He hits Philippe, but D’Artagnan pleads
with Louis to spare his twin’s life and

00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:53.250
show mercy.

00:11:53.250 --> 00:11:55.830
Philippe begs to be executed rather than sent
back to prison.

00:11:55.830 --> 00:11:59.130
King Louis, hardened in his anger against
all three of them, orders him placed back

00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:01.209
in prison and once again in the mask.

00:12:01.209 --> 00:12:04.740
As D’Artagnan comforts the distressed Queen
Anne, they hear a faint scream from a room,

00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:07.649
where they find out that Christine has sadly
taken her life.

00:12:07.649 --> 00:12:10.579
The King enters the room to find her hanging
from the window, where the sight of it angers

00:12:10.579 --> 00:12:11.579
him even more.&nbsp;

00:12:11.579 --> 00:12:13.810
&nbsp;
Meanwhile, Philippe is escorted to his cell,

00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:16.319
and an iron mask is placed on him once again.

00:12:16.319 --> 00:12:19.310
The special key for the mask is handed over
to King Louis to ensure the entrapment of

00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:20.380
his twin.

00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:24.319
Amidst the chaos encircling the whole town,
the three musketeers find refuge in a room,

00:12:24.319 --> 00:12:27.259
where they find a letter from D’Artagnan
instructing them about the whereabouts of

00:12:27.259 --> 00:12:28.259
Philippe.

00:12:28.259 --> 00:12:32.620
Athos, Porthos, and Aramis unearth their old
musketeer uniforms, becoming The Three Musketeers

00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:36.990
again and, with D'Artagnan's help, break into
the prison and escape with Philippe.

00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:38.899
D’Artagnan reunites with them, to make amends.

00:12:38.899 --> 00:12:42.610
Louis, however, has prepared an ambush to
arrest the group that plots to put an end

00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:43.810
to his reign.

00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:47.610
Just like the old days, the four musketeers
stand side by side in battle as King Louis’

00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:48.610
guards charge at them.

00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:52.279
They fight skillfully and manage to protect
themselves despite being outnumbered.

00:12:52.279 --> 00:12:55.910
More soldiers arrive to entrap and beat them,
but they refuse to surrender.

00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:58.899
Philippe begs the four musketeers to give
him up so they could spare their lives, but

00:12:58.899 --> 00:13:02.180
D’Artagnan soon reveals that Philippe and
Louis are his sons.

00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:05.420
Having had an affair with Queen Anne, she
bore twins, and that it was out of fatherly

00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:08.550
devotion that he served Louis, despite his
evilness.

00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:11.880
All of them are astonished to hear his revelation,
which gives them more determination to fight

00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:13.040
back.

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:16.230
Preparing to accept their fate, no matter
how painful it may be, they put their swords

00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:19.139
together and say the phrase “all for one,
and one for all.”

00:13:19.139 --> 00:13:21.899
Philippe joins them, and they all stand to
prepare for battle.

00:13:21.899 --> 00:13:25.630
The palace musketeers point their guns at
them, as defense, covering their King.

00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:29.050
The four Musketeers and Philippe make their
final attack at Louis' front line, where their

00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:33.339
bravery astound the soldiers into immobility,
provoking Louis to shout orders to fire.

00:13:33.339 --> 00:13:36.931
He puts his hands on one of the soldiers'
weapons and fires, setting off the rest, with

00:13:36.931 --> 00:13:39.990
many of them shutting their eyes or looking
away out of reluctance.

00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:43.639
The smoke clears and reveals that the five
men managed to dodge all the bullets.

00:13:43.639 --> 00:13:46.450
All the musketeers express their respect to
the former ones.

00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:49.610
King Louis attacks Philippe with a dagger
out of anger, but D’Artagnan stands in his

00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:51.399
way and gets stabbed instead.

00:13:51.399 --> 00:13:55.150
Philippe knocks Louis to the ground and begins
to strangle him, but D'Artagnan reminds Philippe

00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:58.440
that Louis is his brother and says the musketeer
phrase one last time.

00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:02.220
The crying Philippe grieves his father's death,
but moments later, he swaps clothes and locks

00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:03.950
Louis into the iron mask.

00:14:03.950 --> 00:14:07.800
Philippe announces Athos, Porthos, and Aramis
as his royal advisors.

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:11.870
Posing as the King, Philippe commands the
guards to take Louis and imprison him forever.

00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:15.420
The Musketeers show their respect and kneel
before Philippe, honoring him as their true

00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:16.420
King.

00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:18.160
&nbsp;
At daybreak, they all attend D’Artagnan’s

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:20.600
funeral to say their final goodbyes peacefully.

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:24.880
After the funeral, Philippe kindly asks Athos
to love him like his own son, and Athos accepts,

00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:26.089
kissing Philippe's hand.

00:14:26.089 --> 00:14:30.220
Then, the Three Musketeers walk through the
long line of proud saluting musketeers, idolizing

00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:31.410
the three.

00:14:31.410 --> 00:14:39.889
After that, France is reborn after having
a better king who gave his people food, prosperity,

00:14:39.889 --> 00:14:45.509
and peace.
