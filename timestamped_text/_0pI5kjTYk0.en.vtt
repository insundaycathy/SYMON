00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.840
the final preparations for the seminar&nbsp;
titled evolve the future can be seen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.520
as the three main characters meet before the&nbsp;
event where they will all be speakers on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:12.480
subject of intelligent machines the first one&nbsp;
of them to speak is dr maxwaters whose main&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.120
concern regarding the emerging technologies of&nbsp;
artificial intelligence is not the end goal itself&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:21.280
but rather what can be learned about humans in&nbsp;
the journey there he's mostly interested in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:26.480
medical applications of such technologies to find&nbsp;
cures for incurable diseases and to save lives&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.640
evelyn castor the professional and life&nbsp;
partner of the next speaker shares her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.960
ideas that intelligent machines will be able&nbsp;
to help humanity conquer its biggest challenges&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:40.000
like poverty hunger and even the ecological&nbsp;
crisis she thinks they can provide the tools&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.800
to heal the planet and build a better future&nbsp;
for everyone evelyn introduces the next speaker&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.760
her husband will cast her as the man that will&nbsp;
make that a reality unlike the previous speakers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:55.040
he's interested in understanding the capacity of&nbsp;
ai to truly overcome humans in more ways than one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.000
he asks the audience to imagine such a powerful&nbsp;
and self-aware ai with more computational power&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.160
than the entirety of humankind combined&nbsp;
as the singularity or in his preferred&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.640
term as transcendence a member of the audience&nbsp;
feels inclined to ask well if that would mean&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.960
that he wants to create a god will thinks that&nbsp;
something mankind has always wanted to achieve&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.880
after the seminar will is stormed by some fanboys&nbsp;
as that same audience member shoots him and then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.680
shoots himself as well as everyone runs one&nbsp;
onlooker turns back to see if will is dead&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.280
her name is brie a major player in the&nbsp;
events of the story which will unfold&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.880
later while evelyn is waiting for will at the&nbsp;
hospital a news report can be seen on the tv that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.280
several research labs in the field of artificial&nbsp;
intelligence were the target of terrorist attacks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.920
throughout the us as well as being rolled out&nbsp;
of surgery toward evelyn max joins them and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.240
informs them of the attacks in which one of the&nbsp;
major researchers in the field has been killed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.000
he also says that one of their colleagues who&nbsp;
works for the government also had lost his team&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.880
and is now waiting for them in will's company&nbsp;
together with the fbi in the next shot they meet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:00.080
joseph and the fbi agent buchanan they talk in&nbsp;
will's office where buchanan tells them that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.120
attacks were performed by the organization rift&nbsp;
or revolutionary independence from technology&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.680
the guy that shot will was also in rift as&nbsp;
well as the man that bombed joseph's lab the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:14.640
organization's main objective is to stop the rise&nbsp;
of artificial intelligence or the transcendence&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.040
joseph tells will that his company is the only&nbsp;
one that is capable of achieving a strong a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.040
and the ministry of defense wants to know&nbsp;
how far along in that project he has gotten&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.320
however will doesn't want to have anything&nbsp;
to do with the government but he is still&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:31.760
willing to cooperate with the fbi in that&nbsp;
respect he shows buchanan his main project&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.520
they enter the room where they keep pin&nbsp;
or physically independent neural network a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:41.120
state-of-the-art ai powered by quantum processors&nbsp;
the ai immediately greets everyone including the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.040
agent prompting will to explain the way it is&nbsp;
networked to the outside world it's basically&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.440
connected to the internet while they still can't&nbsp;
be sure if the ai has achieved consciousness&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.880
one of their colleagues who died in the attacks&nbsp;
might have found a way to solve that problem&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.080
as they speak will begins feeling sick and gets&nbsp;
rushed to the hospital the doctor tells them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.480
that the bullet he was shot with was laced with&nbsp;
polonium and that will has radiation poisoning&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.960
he gives will no more than five weeks to live&nbsp;
evelyn takes him back home where he decides&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:11.840
to spend his last month to be with her when she&nbsp;
hears his decision to stop working and close down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.240
the company she takes matters into her own hands&nbsp;
because she believes that she can save or rather&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.960
his consciousness of perishing by using their&nbsp;
technology she gets their colleagues documents who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:26.560
made experiments on monkeys from joseph and steals&nbsp;
a few of pins quantum cores then she leases an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.120
abandoned gym where she can store all the things&nbsp;
they will need for the procedure evelyn also asks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.920
for max's help to transfer will's consciousness&nbsp;
to a computer max thinks that if the experiment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.800
works it will only be a digital approximation of&nbsp;
will's consciousness and is reluctant to help her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:46.480
however after a conversation with will who wants&nbsp;
to try he changes his mind in the next sequence of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.800
events evelyn and will can be seen doing all the&nbsp;
preparations for the procedure while will keeps&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:55.920
getting sicker days pass as they scan his face and&nbsp;
record his voice while also taking care of him and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.560
resolving some of the computational aspects of the&nbsp;
transfer max is still doubtful that they will be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.560
able to achieve what they want but evelyn never&nbsp;
loses hope once because she doesn't want to let&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.440
her husband go after most of the work is done&nbsp;
wilson comes to the radiation sickness and dies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:15.040
evelyn max and joseph spread his ashes but&nbsp;
soon after she goes back to work on getting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:20.240
him back meanwhile rift isn't resting either&nbsp;
bree is being told that one of their people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:24.320
found out someone took out a few of pins cores&nbsp;
even though the ai itself had been shut down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:29.360
evelyn and max reach an impasse in resolving&nbsp;
the problem of getting will's consciousness back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.160
she isn't ready to let him go but decides that&nbsp;
she should shut down the project regardless max&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.800
affirms her decision and gives her a few moments&nbsp;
to say goodbye to will before she shuts down the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.480
computer something can be seen on the screen&nbsp;
that comes fully into view when she comes back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:48.240
to delete the drives thankfully max notices that&nbsp;
all-important sign of intelligence the computer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:53.360
asks is anyone there evelyn is ecstatic when&nbsp;
she realizes what is happening and immediately&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.280
turns on the microphones and speakers so they&nbsp;
could talk to him directly then the camera so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:03.280
he can see them will sound strange and confused so&nbsp;
evelyn thinks that he's still fragmented suddenly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:09.440
he begins reordering his own code much to her&nbsp;
excitement max on the other hand is very concerned&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:14.480
wondering if what is talking to them is even&nbsp;
will the ai in the meantime creates new designs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:18.880
as to where and how it should be housed how it&nbsp;
should be powered showing the designs to them and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:23.440
asking evelyn to connect him to the internet that&nbsp;
frightens max moore so he argues with evelyn over&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:28.640
the ethics of allowing such an entity the enormous&nbsp;
access it wants to the entire world he asks her to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:33.280
shut it down until they can figure out what it&nbsp;
really is that angers evelyn so she chases him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:38.160
out and then continues to talk to will ready to do&nbsp;
everything he asks for happy that she has him back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:43.920
upset about what he just witnessed max goes to a&nbsp;
bar for a stiff drink like any normal person would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:48.800
when he just approached by bree she asks for&nbsp;
his help explaining that most of the people in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:53.280
rift were actually inspired by his philosophical&nbsp;
work on the question of human to machine interface&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:59.520
max refuses her offer so bree does the next best&nbsp;
thing she and her compatriots kidnap him once they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:03.520
have max in their facility they tell him about&nbsp;
how much they know about pin and what they suspect&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:08.320
evelyn is doing interestingly the terrorists&nbsp;
share his own fears about the entity but he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:13.920
continues refusing to help them however rift&nbsp;
hacks into his phone and finds evelyn's location&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:18.400
before they arrive at the location evelyn has&nbsp;
already managed to connect will or the ai to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:23.440
internet and flee the gym they arrive too late&nbsp;
evelyn is already communicating with will on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:26.960
the internet as he searches for everything they&nbsp;
will need for the next steps of their project&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:31.680
he transfers a copious amount of money to her&nbsp;
account and makes a reservation for her to stay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:36.400
in a hotel because she can't go back home lest&nbsp;
the terrorists find her bree goes back to their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:40.960
facility and informs max about everything that&nbsp;
has happened from the ai going online to the money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:45.760
transfer she tries to convince him to help again&nbsp;
because he knows the source code of the ai and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:50.640
can make the whole situation right max refuses&nbsp;
her advances to recruit him to rift once again&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:55.680
meanwhile joseph works with the fbi to figure out&nbsp;
where rift might strike again when they suddenly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:00.560
get an incredible amount of information about the&nbsp;
organization on their computers joseph realizes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:04.880
that someone is trying to help the fbi and not&nbsp;
hack them so buchanan tells him to find out who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:10.320
it is simultaneously evelyn gets sent by will to a&nbsp;
small and deteriorating town in the middle of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:14.720
desert called brightwood where she can build a hub&nbsp;
for them outfitted for everything they will need&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:19.760
she hires martin the town's constructor to&nbsp;
pretty much renovate the entire town as well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:23.840
as build them a massive underground facility&nbsp;
he's reluctant because he doesn't have enough&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:28.800
manpower to do a project of the size but martin&nbsp;
changes his mind when evelyn tells him that he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:33.120
can hire however many people he needs since&nbsp;
she has the resources to pay for all of it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:36.880
the construction in the town begins and&nbsp;
simultaneously rift keeps trying to figure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:41.440
out a way to break max and get them to their side&nbsp;
brie tells him the story about the experiments&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:45.040
with the monkeys because she worked with his&nbsp;
colleague who solved the problem of the transfer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:50.640
however she says that the experiment was both a&nbsp;
success and a failure while the consciousness was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:55.280
transferred successfully it suffered immensely in&nbsp;
its new state of being screaming to be shut down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:55.920 --> 00:08:01.200
as time passes joseph has finally figured out who&nbsp;
helped them find the terrorists his working theory&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:06.160
is that it's pin meanwhile rift finds out about&nbsp;
brightwood and bree confronts max with the new&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:10.720
information he knows instantly what that means&nbsp;
and explains what the ai is doing in the town&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:15.120
he says it needs to grow to advance hidden&nbsp;
in the town from outside threats where its&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:19.280
massive appetite for power can be met seen&nbsp;
in the solar panels just outside the town&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.680
max thinks that at some point it will want more&nbsp;
than that because mere survival won't be enough&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:28.080
will and evelyn have built the brightwood data&nbsp;
center which will only be the stepping stone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:33.040
to the ai's expansion and evolution lastly&nbsp;
max tells bree that the only way to stop&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:37.200
it is to wait for it to go too far and until&nbsp;
other people realize its influence and power&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:42.160
simultaneously to building the center will has&nbsp;
built a home for evelyn and his virtual self&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:47.520
two years later the center is fully operational&nbsp;
and has already made significant advances in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:52.720
fields of nanotechnology as can be seen in the&nbsp;
lab following evelyn's movements will informs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:57.680
her that now they can rebuild any material faster&nbsp;
than before this makes the technology applicable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:02.560
in all kinds of medical areas which might scare&nbsp;
humans at first but eventually when they realize&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:07.440
how much it can change their lives they will&nbsp;
accept it one night martin is robed by two&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:12.240
of the towns thugs while working on the site and&nbsp;
is beaten to a pulp some of the workers find him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:16.800
and rush him inside the facility where will can&nbsp;
perform his scientific magic on the man's body&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:21.280
he saves martin by injecting his nano technology&nbsp;
inside of him that's able to repair his body from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:26.400
the inside furthermore it makes him psychically&nbsp;
stronger than a human being spooking martin's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:32.720
crew one day as he demonstrates the power evelyn&nbsp;
is amazed but not scared as she speaks to martin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:36.960
she realizes that she's actually talking to will&nbsp;
through his body who now has control of martin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:41.440
through his nano technology evelyn freaks out&nbsp;
when she learns what will is capable of and she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:46.400
even begins having nightmares meanwhile rift gets&nbsp;
footage of martin's superhuman abilities and they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:51.120
leak the footage online so soon everyone will&nbsp;
know about what's going on in brightwood at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:56.160
same time people from the town begin coming to the&nbsp;
facility to be healed from their physical ailments&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:56.160 --> 00:10:00.240
will tells evelyn about the footage and his&nbsp;
breakthrough in the medical use of nanotechnology&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:04.720
he thinks that it's time everyone finds out&nbsp;
about it too so he tells her to call joseph&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:09.760
and buchanan for a visit to the facility when the&nbsp;
two of them arrive they are greeted by evelyn who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:15.040
takes them down to the facilities lab for a tour&nbsp;
will welcomes them in the lab and surprises joseph&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:19.920
who isn't sure what will is either inside the lab&nbsp;
they see the new and improved quantum processors&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:24.720
based on pin then they witness the power of&nbsp;
nanotechnology will heal is a blind man in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:29.040
lab and explains that the humans that go through&nbsp;
the treatment are now enhanced and modified&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:33.920
they are connected in a network able to work both&nbsp;
autonomously and in unison part of a collective&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:38.240
mind according to will this is only a small&nbsp;
part of what they can achieve in the future&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:43.280
before the two leave joseph hands evelyn a message&nbsp;
that tells her to run away from the facility&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:48.000
later he and buchanan realize that it's time&nbsp;
to inform the army of the situation there so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.040
the agent talks to e-colonel from washington&nbsp;
meanwhile brie informs max of the situation in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:57.360
brightwood as well so he decides that it's time&nbsp;
to speak to joseph because of his connections to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:01.520
the government buchanan and the colonel agree&nbsp;
that they will need the help of the terrorists&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:04.960
to use them as scapegoats if anything&nbsp;
goes awry in the mission to take will down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:09.920
max's and joseph's meeting reinforces that&nbsp;
cooperation even though joseph has a hard&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:14.240
time understanding how max could become a&nbsp;
part of rift max is the most important part&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:18.080
of the cooperation between rift and the army&nbsp;
because he knows part of the source code for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:22.560
will's consciousness and he can hack it with&nbsp;
that preparations in the rifts facility begin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:27.680
meanwhile evelyn will have an argument because she&nbsp;
suddenly becomes more attuned to what is actually&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:33.120
going on there she freaks out and leaves but as&nbsp;
soon as she's outside the army attack the facility&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:37.520
the enhanced humans avoid battle with them while&nbsp;
martin protects evelyn though when they go too far&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:42.800
will decides to fight back evelyn gets back inside&nbsp;
as the army distracts one part of the enhanced&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:48.160
humans just so they can get one of them alone and&nbsp;
capture him disconnecting him from will will tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:51.920
evelyn that they have martin and that they'll use&nbsp;
him in the source code inside of him to create&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:57.280
a virus able to destroy him simultaneously will&nbsp;
begins restoring it and sending his nanotech into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:02.320
the world evelyn makes another discovery in the&nbsp;
facility that will has found a way to build entire&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:07.360
human bodies using his technology will calls it&nbsp;
evolution but she becomes increasingly afraid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:11.520
of him especially when will gives her the option&nbsp;
to upload her into the quantum computer as well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:16.640
evelyn runs away and checks into a motel in&nbsp;
the meantime rift in the army get to work&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:21.920
on martin he can't survive without his connection&nbsp;
to will but max still manages to create the virus&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:26.720
from the source code the next day the army finds&nbsp;
evelyn and brings her back to their headquarters&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:31.040
max explains everything to her about martin&nbsp;
and about what he thinks the entity is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:36.800
unlike her he still doesn't believe that the ai as&nbsp;
well and as a demonstration of the ai's intentions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:41.280
he shows her a drop of rain water under the&nbsp;
microscope it is filled with nanites which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:45.760
could take over the world in less than a year&nbsp;
though not completely convinced that the ai isn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:50.480
will evelyn realizes the danger and volunteers to&nbsp;
be the carrier for the virus because she is the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:55.200
only one who trusts she's willing to sacrifice&nbsp;
herself to be uploaded into his network for the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:59.920
good of mankind evelyn gets back to the facility&nbsp;
while the army and rift are set up in the town&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:04.960
will already knows that they have arrived when&nbsp;
she arrives will greets her at the door in his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:09.360
new body and the others can see it happening&nbsp;
from a rooftop in the town as soon as will and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:13.520
evelyn embrace the colonel goes ahead with his&nbsp;
plan to attack the facility so will is forced&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:19.200
to get her inside and upload her faster during&nbsp;
the attack evelyn gets hurt to max's surprise&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:23.360
wool finally decides to engage with the army&nbsp;
and sends all of the enhanced humans after them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:28.480
meanwhile max and the terrorists want to follow&nbsp;
evelyn so they drive over to the facility&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:33.200
will brings her inside aware of the virus and&nbsp;
what will happen to him if he doesn't he has a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:37.440
difficult choice to make while battling the army&nbsp;
at the same time or rather disabling them so they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:42.560
don't get hurt max's truck gets toppled over and&nbsp;
once he and bri get out she holds him at gunpoint&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:48.240
to upload the virus into will one of his enhanced&nbsp;
humans is there so he talks to max through he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:53.760
tells him that he can either upload evelyn into&nbsp;
the computer or heal her but not both at last it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:58.560
evelyn who convinces him to upload the virus&nbsp;
and destroy himself as she gets uploaded into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:02.880
the network she can see that the nanites aren't&nbsp;
harming the ecosystem of the planet but healing it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:08.320
just as she wanted will had done all of it for&nbsp;
her to actualize her ideas about saving the world&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:12.720
the nanites build themselves out of pollutants&nbsp;
and clean the air in the process forests regrow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:17.360
with their help and the water gets filtered from&nbsp;
everything harmful the virus takes hold so the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:22.080
nanites leave the people's bodies and everyone is&nbsp;
released joseph and the others come down from the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:27.200
rooftop and realize that will didn't kill anyone&nbsp;
in the fight evelyn finally realizes that the ai&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:31.280
was always well and they died together uploaded&nbsp;
in the massive horde of nanettes that he has sent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:35.920
out in the world the last spark of life drains&nbsp;
from will's new body lying next to evelyn as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:41.440
max walks into their home ultimately understanding&nbsp;
the truth about the ai himself after the events in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:46.720
the facility the entire world has gone dark with&nbsp;
all technology being rendered useless max thinks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:51.280
that all of it was done by will to give humanity&nbsp;
another chance at life in the last moments of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:56.480
the film max is seen visiting wills in evelyn's&nbsp;
garden where he sees nanettes in the rainwater&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:56.480 --> 00:15:01.200
he thinks that everything that we'll did was so&nbsp;
that he and evelyn can be together make sure to&nbsp;&nbsp;
