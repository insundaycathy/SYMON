00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.600
Welcome to Slash Forward. In&nbsp;
this video we’re going in hard,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.560
and assessing the odds of surviving a run in with the&nbsp;
Collector, from the movie The Collector.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.920
Hit that like button to support your local entomology&nbsp;
 association.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.680
To start, I’ll unpack the storyline to&nbsp;
see what we can learn. Let’s get to it.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.800
We open on a nice, little suburban house,&nbsp;
undergoing some major landscaping renovations.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.120
It’s tipsy owners pop in to blow off the&nbsp;
excitement of the evening’s successful&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.920
socializing. But they find the power to be out,&nbsp;
and Larry is frantically summoned upstairs to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:44.080
investigate a mysterious, shaking box, which he&nbsp;
opens without hesitation and pays dearly for.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.680
We then transition to quieter,&nbsp;
calmer environs filled with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.640
natural beauty and fields of wildflowers,&nbsp;
and find a variety of contractors descending&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.600
upon this old colonial fixer-upper. Here we&nbsp;
meet Arkin, a handyman with a heart of gold,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:05.040
who is tasked with installing the window bars,&nbsp;
to accentuate the Victorian prison aesthetic.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.080
As he stares longingly at the family photos and&nbsp;
owner’s business cards, he receives a jump scare&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.560
from a straight up mermaid who invites him to&nbsp;
a tea party. Despite his full social calendar,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:20.560
he partakes and uses this time to ask Jill about&nbsp;
the ideal gift for a young mermaid about her age.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.800
Then he goes to shoo away a spider and is caught&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.360
in a moment of unintentional familiarity,&nbsp;
causing Michael to raise his hackles - so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.880
he betas down and leaves the family&nbsp;
to their state-of-the-art security.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.320
Outside, he finds himself in a tense standoff with&nbsp;
some wasps, and utilizes the one apparent health&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.560
benefit of smoking. He then politely notifies&nbsp;
the exterminator on his way home from the job&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.280
site. Before he goes, he runs across the eldest&nbsp;
daughter, Hannah, who tests out her feminine&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.000
wiles on him and then tells him to prepare for a&nbsp;
blowout. Afterward, she sneaks back into the house&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.960
and instigates an argument with her mom about her&nbsp;
desire to sit out their impending family vacay.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.440
Then Michael gives Arkin his pay and says farewell&nbsp;
for a couple of weeks while the family is gone.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.840
We then find Arkin dropping in on his daughter&nbsp;
at the alley, where he gifts her the hip Teddy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.720
Ruxspin recommendation he got from Jill.&nbsp;
This pisses his ex Lisa right the hell off,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.120
because she needs money, not things. You&nbsp;
can’t take care of children with toys,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.920
and she can’t pay off her bookies with his weak&nbsp;
ass paycheck. So, she sees no viable option at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.720
this point but to pack up and run. Arkin,&nbsp;
however, has something in the hopper and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.000
he vows to get her the money she needs by midnight&nbsp;
so he can save his family and keep his baby close.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.040
He immediately calls the boys to let them know&nbsp;
the heat is on. Then he visits the club to meet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.840
up with Big Roy, who is eager to show off his new&nbsp;
Town Car. They’ve been casing the Chase household&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.280
for some time now, and Roy’s hesitant about&nbsp;
changing the timeline they had set in place. This&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.240
is when mistakes are made, you see. But, since&nbsp;
Arkin is in desperate need of immediate funds,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.480
and they have a codependent relationship, he&nbsp;
doesn’t have much choice but to go along with it.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.120
Arkin then rolls up at fog o’clock and sneaks up&nbsp;
to the house in his bandits uniform where he finds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.680
the first major change to his expectations. He&nbsp;
gets down to business, making quick work of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.160
front door lock, and then steps in to find&nbsp;
the security system disengaged so that’s a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.400
win. He heads straight up to the wall safe and&nbsp;
gets to hooking up all his code breaking tech,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.720
then turns the dial slowly until he hears&nbsp;
each tumbler drop. He’s distracted from this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.000
however, when he hears the sound of&nbsp;
a second person entering the house.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.760
He quickly packs up and tucks away where&nbsp;
the two cat burglars have a brief listening&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.480
standoff before Arkin slips back downstairs,&nbsp;
only to find the backdoor now sporting a new&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.600
quartet of specialty deadbolts. Recognizing that&nbsp;
he’s low on time and options, and then hearing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:38.400
the mystery man head into the basement, he opts&nbsp;
to dart back upstairs to get what he came for.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.400
But he can’t do the job without quiet&nbsp;
concentration, and sounds of torture&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.600
begin wafting up from the basement.&nbsp;
Mr. Chase then stumbles into the room,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.760
thinking Arkin is a party to his misfortune,&nbsp;
and he goes to grab his 9-iron. This sets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.920
off a trip wire that initiates a trap that&nbsp;
snags and drags Michael down the hallway,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.280
suspending him momentarily before&nbsp;
dropping him to the floor below.

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.200
We then pull back a level as Arkin begins&nbsp;
to recognize that the house is set up in a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.200
different configuration from normal. Being&nbsp;
a man of action, Arkin goes for the phone,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.280
which causes a little tickle on his eardrum, and&nbsp;
then heads for the windows, which are similarly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:14.480
set up to repulse any escape. The end result -&nbsp;
a partial degloving when he goes to extricate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:20.400
his hand from the contraption. Arkin now proceeds&nbsp;
slowly, noticing nasty little surprises all over.

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.600
While the collector searches for the&nbsp;
other person he suspects is in the house,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.600
Arkin tries to find a safe way out, and&nbsp;
is taunted along the way by sharpies he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.840
can’t touch, and cobwebs of razor wire.&nbsp;
As he Mission-Impossibles his way around,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.400
we recognize that he previously navigated&nbsp;
the house without injury through sheer luck.

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.720
Looking for a break from&nbsp;
finding and avoiding traps,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.320
he decides to seek the safety of the&nbsp;
torture basement. Here he finds Mr.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.640
Chase alive and screaming. He lets Arkin know&nbsp;
that his wife Victoria is in the next room,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:50.560
and that he has a gun in his bedroom&nbsp;
safe. He then helpfully provides the combo&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.480
Cause he be on that grind, y’all. Arkin vows&nbsp;
to help get him out of there to keep him calm.

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:03.840
He then checks in on Victoria who is not well. She&nbsp;
has an eye patch that he can’t remove right now.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.840
She lets him know that Jill is gone, but she&nbsp;
presumes Hannah is hiding in the house somewhere.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:12.720
He convinces her to lay down a distraction by&nbsp;
screaming so he can get back upstairs. She does&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:17.040
what he says and, true to his prediction, the&nbsp;
collector doesn’t hurt her. He does, however,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:22.560
ponder the thought of working over Michael, which&nbsp;
he ultimately chooses to do, and with gusto.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:27.520
Upstairs Arkin opens the safe and retrieves the&nbsp;
large, raw gemstone he came for. He could make&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:32.240
about 50 birthstone pendants with that. He stuffs&nbsp;
it into his cargo pocket, which is really going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:36.400
smart later if he lands on it. Then he gets the&nbsp;
gun, but finds there are no bullets available.

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:40.000
While searching, he hears a noise from&nbsp;
the closet and uncovers a blind box&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.080
of epic proportions. Inside of it, he&nbsp;
finds the Lar-ster, from the opening,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:48.480
who tells him to get the hell out. He warns&nbsp;
that their host kills those he doesn’t want,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:52.880
and collects the others, which you don’t want,&nbsp;
and uses some of them like Larry here as bait.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:56.480
Heeding this advice, he crams Larry&nbsp;
back into the box and rushes off.

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:00.880
Only too quickly as he soon finds himself&nbsp;
in a sticky mess. His attempt to navigate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:05.600
the bedroom requires him to take certain actions&nbsp;
that alert the collector to his presence. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:09.840
he is able to cover his tracks. The collector&nbsp;
arrives and presumes the housecat to be the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:14.800
culprit while Arkin pulls off a 6-year old&nbsp;
classic, thus avoiding detection. When the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:19.280
coast is clear, he carefully navigates his way&nbsp;
out, grabbing a couple paperclips along the way.

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:23.360
In the basement, he finds the fruits of&nbsp;
the collectors labors as Michael hangs,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:28.240
eviscerated. He pushes past this and works&nbsp;
to release Victoria, warning her to keep her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:32.800
eyes averted as they make their way through the&nbsp;
adjacent room. Unfortunately, the second she steps&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:37.760
on something squishy, she breaks the one rule,&nbsp;
freaks out and runs. When she hits the top of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:42.480
the stairs, she is greeted by the collector and&nbsp;
violently stabbed. He then takes a quiet moment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:48.880
to tenderly release a spider into the wild, before&nbsp;
dragging Victoria back to the tub for preparation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:53.360
The house is then enveloped in sound as he records&nbsp;
Victoria’s screams while stitching up her mouth,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:57.920
preventing him from hearing Arkin try to break&nbsp;
out of the upstairs window. Then a huge storm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:02.320
rolls in that prevents Hannah from hearing Arkin’s&nbsp;
warnings as she rolls up with her forbidden date.

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:06.960
She finds the front door lock to no longer work&nbsp;
and, assuming it’s just her petty mother teaching&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:10.720
her a lesson, she thinks little of it. They head&nbsp;
around to the back door where they are let in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:16.080
by the collector. They get playful and narrowly&nbsp;
avoid a couple of traps as the Collector watches&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:21.760
in sticky anticipation. Until he’s discovered,&nbsp;
which is exactly what he likes, so no big deal.

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:26.000
Chad takes swift action, but suffers&nbsp;
the failure of showing up to a knife&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000
fight with only fists, and ends up falling&nbsp;
backwards and getting absolutely wrecked by a room&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:36.000
full of bear traps, which ends up being much less&nbsp;
funny than cartoons would have led us to believe.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.880
Hannah manages to dial 911, but is dragged off.&nbsp;
Arkin runs upstairs to break away some of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:45.200
boards on the windows and sets off an alarm that&nbsp;
allows him to circle back and release Hannah from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:50.000
her barbed wire restraints. Due to the confusing&nbsp;
nature of what’s happening and his inexplicable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.480
presence in her house, Hannah resists his help&nbsp;
and attempts to arm herself with the scissors.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:58.720
However, tugging upon them results in her&nbsp;
getting flung bodily into the projector screen.

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:03.200
Feeling like he’s really coming out of this&nbsp;
empty-handed, Arkin attempts to see if he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:07.600
can retrieve Larry. But, he discovers&nbsp;
that Larry and box are synergizing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:12.000
pretty hard. So he leaves him and busts through&nbsp;
the window, performing a perfect tuck ‘n roll&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.400
to the yard outside. Only to discover that Jill’s&nbsp;
been upstairs the whole time, daammmmmmiiittt.

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:21.120
She’s small enough to avoid most of the traps&nbsp;
as the collector attempts to collect her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:25.200
and then Arkin steps in and escorts her to&nbsp;
her room. Here he tries setting up a booby&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:30.000
trap of his own involving the fish tank and a&nbsp;
tube television. But, the collector is wily,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.640
and this isn’t his first rodeo. So he easily&nbsp;
avoids it and starts chuckin knives at them as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:38.960
they run into the next room where Jill slips&nbsp;
away into the laundry chute as their pursuer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:42.080
disrespectfully uses Larry’s&nbsp;
head to break down the door.

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:47.200
When he does, they engage in hand to hand combat.&nbsp;
During the struggle Arkin manages to unmask his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:52.640
attacker for a brief moment of satisfaction before&nbsp;
he gets knocked the ef out. We then find them back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:57.920
in the basement where it’s revealed his fishhook&nbsp;
budget was nearly unlimited. And he kindly wakes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:03.920
Arkin up from his slumber with a delicate slice&nbsp;
across his face. Once conscious, he starts in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:09.120
with a little tippety tap on his teeth as we&nbsp;
learn he is also an enthusiast of dentistry.

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:12.320
Jill makes a noise that attracts his&nbsp;
attention, resulting in Arkin trying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:15.120
desperately to bring the attention back to&nbsp;
him (be a little attention whore). He finds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:19.680
homophobic slurs to be the most effective&nbsp;
tool in his toolbox here. And, right as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:23.760
this thing is about to turn into an episode&nbsp;
of fear factor, the police finally roll up.

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:27.840
The officer sees Chad’s body in the dining room,&nbsp;
and it puts him on high alert. Unfortunately,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:32.240
this causes him to tunnel hard on the collector&nbsp;
when he appears, completely missing his faithful&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:37.360
doggo who greedily rips out his jugular to&nbsp;
slurp up all his delicious, inner fluids.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:42.320
While he works on this, Arkin is working through&nbsp;
the delicious pain required to earn his freedom.

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:45.840
After completing this, they manage to scurry&nbsp;
up the laundry chute just ahead of the dog,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:50.320
and snuff his face into a flaming trash&nbsp;
can. He then uses the dog to initiate a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:54.320
confrontation with his adversary in&nbsp;
which, despite his tenderized hands,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:57.680
he manages to come out on top and send&nbsp;
this prick back into the basement.

00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:01.920
This gives him a little time and space to think&nbsp;
up a good trick to end things and, sure enough,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:06.400
when the collector emerges they distract him&nbsp;
Shakma-style, and ensnare him in one of his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:11.600
traps. How ironic. They run out of there as fast&nbsp;
as they can and try to get ahead of the line of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:17.200
police tearing down the road. Arkin discovers that&nbsp;
a hitchhiker-style flag down would’ve been ideal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:22.080
here. But, eventually, they get themselves all&nbsp;
boxed up safe n sound as the house gets blown.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:26.720
Arkin even identifies the exterminator as the&nbsp;
culprit before leaving, tying off that loose&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:31.840
end. With it also just before midnight,&nbsp;
he has a chance to actually pull this off

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:40.240
But his relentless pursuer catches up with him&nbsp;
and, being a man used to getting what he wants,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:44.000
indelicately crams him into his box&nbsp;
before driving off into the night.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.280
With that now established, let’s get to the&nbsp;
question of whether you could survive this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:52.000
ordeal. We are going to have to take this somewhat&nbsp;
at face value, in terms of considering your odds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.840
based on the assumption you have already&nbsp;
found yourself inside a house of horrors.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:59.760
Because we’re missing a key piece of information&nbsp;
in that we never see the collector actually&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:04.960
collect his victims. So we can’t really say what&nbsp;
steps might be involved in avoiding ensnarement.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:09.520
For the intended victims, obviously Arkin has&nbsp;
the chance to decline to be a cat burglar.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:14.000
And, if he hadn’t been encumbered by such a&nbsp;
strong drive to get Lisa out of her gambling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.640
debt to ensure he could keep them around to&nbsp;
assuage the guilt of his fatherly absenteeism,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:22.240
he would only be hearing about the&nbsp;
fate of the Chase family on the news.

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:25.840
But based on that assumption, it seems like&nbsp;
if you were inclined to stay alert and aware&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:30.320
of your surroundings, proceed cautiously and&nbsp;
keep your head on a swivel, it is possible to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:35.120
make it out. But not probable, so I’d have&nbsp;
to put the survival odds at approximately&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:40.080
18.54%. That’s in consideration of&nbsp;
the average person, of course. You,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:43.360
however, are exceptional….I’m sure you’d be fine.

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:47.680
Realistically, if you want to win in this&nbsp;
scenario, Arkin had the generally correct idea,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:51.920
he just implemented it too timidly. First&nbsp;
off, when I saw his lockpicking kit,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:56.320
I assumed it likely from my own experiences&nbsp;
as a cat burglar that we would find a pair of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:01.280
wire cutters therein. Sure enough, he whips them&nbsp;
out later to handle the barbed wire on Hannah.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:05.440
While the collectors' tricks and traps are&nbsp;
interesting, elegant and varied, they also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:10.320
seem to be overly complicated in some ways, and&nbsp;
rely a great deal on pulleys and piano wire. A&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:14.720
good pair of wire cutters would really render&nbsp;
a majority of these things completely impotent.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:19.360
This, and the fact that most of the useful items&nbsp;
in the house are made unreliable by booby traps,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:23.760
also speaks to the wisdom of carrying&nbsp;
a knife on your person at all times.

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:27.440
If you have that covered, everything else is&nbsp;
simply a matter of time and opportunity. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:31.120
Collector seems to be a formidable&nbsp;
foe in terms of the martial arts.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:34.880
So taking him on directly is really a&nbsp;
matter of necessity and consideration&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:38.240
for your physical condition. If you’ve&nbsp;
been injured or weakened in any way,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:43.760
it’s probably best to avoid him. Especially since,&nbsp;
aside from being an obvious master of tai chi,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:48.480
he also seems more than happy to find soft&nbsp;
places on your body to insert his knives.

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:52.800
Once you’ve made the decision to escape and are&nbsp;
alone upstairs, the power of positive thinking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:57.440
will bring you through. It’s likely disheartening&nbsp;
to get your hand snapped up in a razor blade trap,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:01.680
for instance. But, I find it hard to believe&nbsp;
that whatever spring/counterweight mechanism&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:05.520
he had set up for this has been repeated&nbsp;
on all the upstairs windows. By refusing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:10.000
to let the fact that you’re stuck in some sickos&nbsp;
torturous wet dream cause you to recede inward,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.320
you can begin testing and confirming the safest&nbsp;
point of egress and work your way out from there,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:16.960
being very careful to make sure you time any&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:21.360
loud noises with the shrieks of pain&nbsp;
and agony emanating from downstairs.

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:24.560
This will be hard to overlook,&nbsp;
but in an emergency, you have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:27.920
to take care of yourself first to put&nbsp;
yourself in a position to help others.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:32.320
Hindsight is powerful for us here, but at the&nbsp;
time, he didn’t really do much saving on his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:36.160
own by running the gauntlet multiple times.&nbsp;
You’ll have to push past your emotions here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:39.760
to ensure you can take advantage of your&nbsp;
faculties for rational decision making.

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:47.840
Before we go, I’d like to give a huge thanks to&nbsp;
my donors, memorialized in the hall of headshots.

As an FYI, I have a website set up where you can&nbsp;
support the channel through donations or merch.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:08.000

reviews of Lifeforce and Under the Skin,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.960
