00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.440
Story Recapped here. Today, I'm going to explain&nbsp;
a horror and thriller film called "Wrong Turn."&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.560
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.320
In the West Virginian Appalachian wilderness,&nbsp;
a couple climbs deep within the forest. The man&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.280
reaches the top while his girlfriend struggles.&nbsp;
She loses footing, but luckily she’s on a harness.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:25.040
She asks her boyfriend to pull her up, but&nbsp;
he doesn’t respond. Suddenly, the man lays&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:29.840
lifeless by the edge. His killer throws him over&nbsp;
the edge and starts pulling the woman’s harness.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.680
She uses a knife to cut her harness, but she&nbsp;
loses balance and falls beside her dead boyfriend.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.400
The killer chases her down,&nbsp;
and she runs for her life.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.320
With her car in sight, she trips on barbwire.&nbsp;
The killer then pulls her and kills her.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.680
News about the couple’s death spreads&nbsp;
throughout the county, reaching Chris’&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.040
car radio as he drives along. He&nbsp;
encounters unexpected traffic.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.080
Chris exits the vehicle to ask&nbsp;
a trucker what’s happening.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.640
The trucker says a truck spilled chemicals on the&nbsp;
road, and it’ll take hours until it’s cleaned up.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.320
Chris starts up his car and turns back. He tries&nbsp;
to call someone to inform them that he’ll be late&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.840
for his job interview, but he has no reception.&nbsp;
On his way, Chris sees a sign and takes a detour.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.720
He arrives at a gas station. Chris&nbsp;
uses the payphone, but it doesn’t work.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.040
He asks the owner if he has another&nbsp;
phone, but he refuses to lend it to him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.480
So Chris looks at the map, and&nbsp;
he finds a marked-off path.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.480
As he leaves, the owner wishes&nbsp;
him good luck with the journey,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.800
seeming like he foresees&nbsp;
grim events about to occur.

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:37.040
On the path, Chris encounters a crossroads.&nbsp;
He sees a sign that says bear mountain road.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:42.560
He thinks for a while and continues to drive&nbsp;
down that path. Suddenly, his stereo acts up,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:48.560
the C.D. ejects, and Chris reaches for it. He&nbsp;
puts it back, and he regains control. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.960
he gets distracted by his dashing looks in the&nbsp;
rearview mirror and crashes into another vehicle.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:59.680
As Chris exits his car, Scott and Carly&nbsp;
approach him to make sure he's okay. Evan&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.360
starts berating him for driving&nbsp;
recklessly, and Francine&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.400
asks him to pay for the damage done to her&nbsp;
mother’s car. The group explains that they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:14.000
blew a tire, which is why they’re stuck in the&nbsp;
middle of the road. Jessie informs the group that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.560
she found a barbwire that punctured their tires.&nbsp;
They plan to look for someone that can help them.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.080
Jessie converses with Chris&nbsp;
and asks him to carry her bag.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.080
Scott apologizes as he feels terrible&nbsp;
for the way his friends treat Chris.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.080
The four of them leave while Evan and&nbsp;
Francine stay behind to keep watch.

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.840
Scott becomes friendly with Chris, asking him if&nbsp;
everything was in slow motion when he crashed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.720
Chris just laughs at his silly remarks. After&nbsp;
a while, the group encounters a dead animal.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.800
Scott thinks it’s a squirrel, but&nbsp;
Chris corrects him, saying it’s a mink.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.600
Humblebragging the fact that&nbsp;
he went to medical school.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.640
Evan and Francine contemplate how they should’ve&nbsp;
taken Jessie to New York instead of the woods.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.280
Francine says that Jessie loves the woods, and as&nbsp;
her friends, they should help her get through her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.560
recent breakup. The conversation leads to Francine&nbsp;
sliding down and asking Evan to remove his pants.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.240
She kisses him and plans to up&nbsp;
the ante by going down on Evan.

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.400
Meanwhile, Scott and Carly daydream&nbsp;
about their future as a couple.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.760
Scott then sees flames beside a tree.&nbsp;
Someone started a fire not too long ago,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.640
and they call out to the mystery person. However,&nbsp;
no one answers, and they go about their way.

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.680
Evan searches the back of their vehicle to find&nbsp;
something to eat, while Francine snacks on a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:31.760
candy bar in Chris’ car. She looks through Chris’&nbsp;
C.D.’s and judges his taste in music. Suddenly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:37.040
a faint noise of a branch breaking sparks Evan’s&nbsp;
curiosity, and he leaves to check it out. Feeling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:42.400
worried, Francine walks deeper into the forest to&nbsp;
search for him. On the ground, she sees his shoe.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.840
Concurrently, Scott and Carly are planning&nbsp;
their future wedding. He acts more of a bride&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.720
than her as he chooses their wedding singer. As&nbsp;
time passes, Scott gets lost in his thoughts.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.080
He finally realizes that&nbsp;
Carly isn’t with him anymore.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.840
After more searching, Francine&nbsp;
sees Evan’s ear on the ground.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.000
She steps back in fear and disgust,&nbsp;
unknowingly walking to her death.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.160
Scott is starting to feel more anxious&nbsp;
as Carly is still nowhere to be found.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:13.520
She then appears, scaring Scott. The two then&nbsp;
catch up with Chris and Jessie standing at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:17.440
the edge of a cliff. Scott pretends&nbsp;
to trip, almost going over the edge.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.320
Chris and Jessie leave the two as Carly starts&nbsp;
talking about their future sensual escapades.

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:27.600
The couples arrive at a cabin in the woods.&nbsp;
They find it odd that several abandoned vehicles&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:33.680
surround the home. Chris knocks on the cabin, but&nbsp;
no one answers. They decide to enter the shack.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.200
They rummage through all the filth to&nbsp;
try and find a phone, but to no avail.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:42.000
Scott urges them to leave the place as he&nbsp;
suspects that the homeowner belongs to a cult,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.760
but Carly shouts at him to shut up. Scott then&nbsp;
opens a room filled with random items. Jessie also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:53.120
finds an odd collection of sunglasses. Meanwhile,&nbsp;
Chris finds a pot filled with boiling dark liquid.

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:58.160
Chris enters another room that has a working&nbsp;
generator powering up refrigerators and coolers.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:04.160
He opens it up to find jars filled with body&nbsp;
parts. Simultaneously, Jessie finds barbed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.800
wire covered up in a corner, Chris opens up&nbsp;
a container with human flesh, and Carly sees&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.520
a dead body submerged in the bathtub. They’re&nbsp;
about to leave when suddenly, a pick-up truck&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:18.320
arrives with their vehicles in tow. They try to&nbsp;
exit through the backdoor, but it’s barricaded.

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:22.960
The mutants enter their home while Jessie and&nbsp;
Scott hide under a bed. One of the mutants drops&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:28.080
Francine’s body, and the two see her mangled&nbsp;
face. Her blood flows through Chris’ hand, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:33.120
they shake in fear and disgust. The mutants with&nbsp;
deformed faces then start cutting up Francine.

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:38.240
A bullet drops under the bed, and a mutant&nbsp;
reaches for it, luckily missing the two under&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:42.480
the bed. Behind a keyhole, Carly whimpers&nbsp;
at the sight of them butchering her friend.

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:47.120
After some time, the mutants take a&nbsp;
deserved nap after a long day of killing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:52.160
The two couples start to make their way out&nbsp;
of the cabin. Carly knocks down a pitcher,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:57.680
making noise, but the mutants stay sleeping. She&nbsp;
can’t bear to look at Francine’s chopped-up body.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.160
They near the exit, and as Jessie opens the&nbsp;
door, Chris holds onto the door spring to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:06.800
stop it from making a sound. His hands start&nbsp;
to bleed as everyone takes their time leaving.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.240
Due to this, one of the mutants&nbsp;
awakens and sees them leaving.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.960
They start running up the mountain, and behind&nbsp;
them are the brothers riding off for another hunt.

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:20.960
Carly is in distress, slowing down the group.&nbsp;
Scott comforts her by talking about their future,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:26.160
and she calms down. They arrive in an area filled&nbsp;
with abandoned vehicles and remnants of murders.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:31.840
In the distance, Chris hears the pick-up truck&nbsp;
closing in. They get down to avoid being seen,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:36.480
and the deformed brothers start to search for&nbsp;
their prey. Chris plans to use the pick-up truck&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:41.280
to escape. Scott suggests one of them distracts&nbsp;
the mutants while the others get into the vehicle.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:46.000
Without hesitating, Chris starts running&nbsp;
and shouting. One of the mutants shoots&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.880
Chris in the calf, disabling him. To try and&nbsp;
save him, Scott also runs to distract them.

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:55.440
Jessie and Carly help Chris to&nbsp;
the truck. Upon opening the door,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:58.160
Evan rolls out, and Carly&nbsp;
gets emotional once more.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:03.040
They drive off, but right behind them is&nbsp;
one of the brothers. Deeper in the woods,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:09.200
they spot Scott. He runs towards them, but he&nbsp;
suddenly stops moving. An arrow pierces his chest,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:14.640
killing him. Another arrow shatters the glass,&nbsp;
prompting Jessie to drive, leaving Scott behind.

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:20.960
In the truck, Carly can't accept her fiance’s&nbsp;
death and begs Jessie to turn back. After a few&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:26.320
hours of driving, they return to the path. Without&nbsp;
the love of her life, Carly’s eyes are lifeless.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:32.000
Unfortunately, the truck gets stuck in the mud,&nbsp;
so they abandon it. Carly refuses to believe they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.040
can survive and loses all hope. Jessie tries to&nbsp;
tell her that Scott sacrificed himself so they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:41.920
could survive. She eventually listens, and&nbsp;
they continue their journey. Chris cuts it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:46.480
close as he almost gets caught in a bear trap.&nbsp;
Carly then maniacally laughs at what happened.

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:52.560
The group comes across a watchtower. Carly starts&nbsp;
shouting to see if someone is up there, and Jessie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:57.120
asks her to be quiet. They climb up the rickety&nbsp;
ladder, and they reach the top just in time for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:03.040
sunset. Chris and Jessie start to look for nearby&nbsp;
roads or towns while Carly remains pessimistic.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:06.400
They find a first aid kit, and&nbsp;
Jessie helps in fixing up Chris’ leg.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:10.400
Carly finds a radio, but no one&nbsp;
responds to their distress call.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:14.720
Outside, a faint light from a torch&nbsp;
signals Chris that the mutants are close.

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:20.080
The mutants pass by them, but a blaring&nbsp;
alarm from the radio catches their attention.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:25.040
A ranger receives their distress call and asks for&nbsp;
their location. Carly shouts that she doesn’t know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:29.600
where they are. The mutants start climbing up&nbsp;
the ladder, and Chris starts to barricade the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:34.960
entrance. Jessie gives them a general idea of&nbsp;
their whereabouts. The radio base advises them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:39.280
to stay put as he’ll come to rescue them.&nbsp;
One mutant starts poking through the hatch,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:44.560
and Chris starts crushing it. Suddenly, they stop&nbsp;
trying to enter, and it becomes eerily silent.

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:50.720
As smoke rises outside, they realize that the&nbsp;
watchtower is on fire. Carly throws a crate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:54.960
through the window and plans to jump, saying she’d&nbsp;
rather die from the impact than burn to death.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:59.840
Chris realizes that Carly is right, saying&nbsp;
there’s a possibility to survive the fall.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:04.880
He jumps, and the branches catch him.&nbsp;
Carly and Jessie successfully follow,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:06.320
but the mutants hear their screams.

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:12.000
They start walking through the trees, hiding&nbsp;
within the shadows. Random arrows fire up from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.200
below, making them wary of their every move. One&nbsp;
of the mutants comes face to face with Carly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:22.320
and he buries an ax in her face. Chris and&nbsp;
Jessie watch as her body separates from her head.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:26.960
They continue to escape, and the laughs and&nbsp;
wails of the mutants echo throughout the forest.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:31.440
Chris stops to pull on a branch that he intends&nbsp;
to use to push off the mutant in the trees.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:36.080
Jessie leaves to lure the mutant. The mutant&nbsp;
drops behind her with a knife in hand.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:38.480
Chris lets go of the branch&nbsp;
and the mutant flies off.

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:44.160
Chris and Jessie hide behind a waterfall. Jessie&nbsp;
opens up about her breakup, saying it was her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:48.640
fault that her friends died. Chris comforts her&nbsp;
as they spend the night in each other’s embrace.

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:54.720
Jessie dreams about the mutants attacking her.&nbsp;
She wakes up, startling Chris. They leave the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:54.720 --> 00:10:00.320
waterfall to carry on with their escape. The first&nbsp;
sign of hope appears as they see a road. But then,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:04.880
an ax hurls toward Chris, and the mutants&nbsp;
surround them. They push Chris off, and they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:10.320
abduct Jessie. A ranger drives down the road,&nbsp;
and Chris intercepts him. He reports about the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:15.920
mutants killing them. However, an arrow pierces&nbsp;
the ranger’s eye midway through the conversation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:19.440
The mutant barely misses the next shot,&nbsp;
prompting Chris to hide under the car.

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:25.280
The mutant grabs the keys and looks underneath&nbsp;
to find no one. Chris hides behind the shrubbery,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:29.680
waiting for the mutant to enter the car. He&nbsp;
slides and latches onto the undercarriage.

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:34.800
Back in the cabin, Jessie asks the mutant to&nbsp;
let her go. Chris and the other mutant arrive,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:39.200
and he watches him drag the ranger to the&nbsp;
cabin. He hears Jessie’s cries as she watches&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:45.200
them butcher the ranger. Suddenly, a fire erupts,&nbsp;
and one of the mutants approaches to check on it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:50.080
Chris rams the front of the house and the mutant&nbsp;
with it. He throws a Molotov at the last mutant,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:55.280
lighting him on fire. He stabs him, and the&nbsp;
burning mutant falls to the ground. As soon as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:55.280 --> 00:11:00.560
Chris frees Jessie, another mutant throws him to&nbsp;
the wall, grabs an ax, and starts attacking him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:04.800
The mutant strangles Chris, allowing Jessie to&nbsp;
shoot him in the back of the head with an arrow.

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:09.040
As they think the horror has ended,&nbsp;
the last mutant rushes towards Chris.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:13.920
Jessie hits him from behind with a burning&nbsp;
piece of wood. The mutant focuses on her with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:18.560
two knives in hand, kicking her through the&nbsp;
glass. Chris then strangles him with a chain,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:22.560
and Jesse deals the final blow with&nbsp;
an ax. The three are still alive,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:26.720
and with only a single shot, Chris shoots&nbsp;
a fuel tank, and the cabin explodes.

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:31.760
After a while, the mutants' pick-up truck&nbsp;
approaches the gas station, and the owner&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:37.440
closes up in fear. To his surprise, a beaten-up&nbsp;
Chris steps out of the vehicle to grab a map.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:41.040
Chris and Jesse survive, and they&nbsp;
drive off for Chris’ job interview.

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:45.760
Inbred, serial-killing, and cannibal&nbsp;
brothers reside within the forest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:49.600
somewhere in West Virginia. For years,&nbsp;
they’ve gruesomely murdered passing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:52.960
tourists that simply want to immerse&nbsp;
themselves with nature for vacation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:58.000
Unaware that they’ll soon be immersed in a pool&nbsp;
of their own blood. A group of young adults&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.280
encountered the mutants and experienced&nbsp;
the same horrors as those before them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:07.920
However, with skill, luck, and plot armor on their&nbsp;
side, Chris and Jessie barely survive. Ridding&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:12.480
the world of murderers, and creating a special&nbsp;
relationship built on the foundations of trauma.

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:17.600
After a harrowing encounter with hillbilly&nbsp;
inbred cannibalistic mutants deep in the woods,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:22.240
Chris and Jessie make it out alive. With their&nbsp;
friends all fallen victim to the killers,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:24.400
Chris and Jessie have a newfound respect for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:27.520
life and have formed a stronger bond&nbsp;
through a shared traumatic experience.
