00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.400
Story Recapped here. Today I'm going to explain&nbsp;
a science fiction action film called Ghost in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:10.480
Shell. Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care In&nbsp;
the near future, there is only a thin line between&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.960
human and machine. Technological advancements&nbsp;
allow humans to enhance themselves with cybernetic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.360
parts. In what seems to be an emergency room,&nbsp;
a medical team brings in an injured woman.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:24.320
Mira Killian, a woman in the accident, is reborn&nbsp;
as a cyborg, but her brain is still intact.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.240
She gains consciousness after the sheet is&nbsp;
uncovered. She has difficulty breathing after&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.160
the procedure and is confused about where she&nbsp;
is or what is happening. She meets her designer,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.040
Dr Ouelet, who monitors her condition. She reveals&nbsp;
to Mira that she is the sole survivor of a refugee&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.520
boat attacked by rebels who killed her parents.&nbsp;
She also says that Mira's body was beyond repair,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.520
leaving her no choice but to replace it with&nbsp;
a synthetic shell. Mira twitches as she feels&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.760
restrained in the bed. Dr Ouelet speaks to Hanka&nbsp;
Robotics CEO Cutter about the strengths and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.240
abilities that Mira's new body possesses. They&nbsp;
call her "the first of her kind". Cutter wants&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.400
to place Mira in Section 9, an anti-terrorism&nbsp;
division, but Dr Ouelet feels she is not ready&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.760
for such a thing. A year later, in a futuristic&nbsp;
cyber world, Mira overlooks the great cityscape.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.560
She is now known as "The Major". She communicates&nbsp;
with Section 9 Chief Daisuke Aramaki, from who she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.800
receives orders. She is listening to a meeting&nbsp;
between Hanka representative Dr Osmond and an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.120
African Ambassador. Mira informs Aramaki that&nbsp;
someone is scanning data traffic as shown in her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.760
device. She traces where the transmission is from,&nbsp;
accessing various surveillances from properties&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.840
around the area. They find out that danger is&nbsp;
around the African Ambassador and Dr Osmond.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.560
During the business conference, a group of men&nbsp;
opens fire. The group of geisha robots start&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.640
to attack people in the conference room. This&nbsp;
urges Mira to take action despite Aramaki not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.160
giving orders. She jumps from the building&nbsp;
and goes invisible to save the essential&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.600
officials in the conference. The men shoot&nbsp;
recklessly at the people in the room as one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.440
of the geisha robots extracts information&nbsp;
from Dr Osmond's neck before killing him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.920
Out of nowhere, the armed men start falling to&nbsp;
the ground after shots fire. They look around,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.560
but Mira is invisible.The geisha robot drags&nbsp;
Dr Osmond around the room while the data is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.360
stored in her system. Mira emerges from a glass&nbsp;
window and finishes off the remaining attackers.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.800
Her skills and movements are much more&nbsp;
advanced compared to the ones in the room.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.440
She shoots the geisha robot; before finishing it&nbsp;
off, it tells her, "Cooperate with Hanka Robotics&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.560
and be destroyed." The phrase made an impact on&nbsp;
Mira, and it confuses her. The other operative,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.960
Batou, arrives at the scene and notices Mira's&nbsp;
injury on her wrist. She looks at it and sees&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.840
a resemblance with the geisha robot. She walks&nbsp;
away after Batou says that it is not the same.&nbsp;

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.640
Mira becomes restless that night as it bothers&nbsp;
her that she only remembers so little from her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.800
upbringing. She hallucinates and sees glitches out&nbsp;
of nowhere, which she thinks are fragments of her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.600
past. She makes her way outside after injecting&nbsp;
a medication provided by the company. She walks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.960
through crowded streets until she gets to the&nbsp;
department of defence section 9 headquarters.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:44.080
Mira, Togusa, Batou, and Carlos discuss the&nbsp;
attack in a room using a dimensional image of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.240
the group of men. While concluding the source,&nbsp;
Aramaki arrives, and they all stand still.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.960
Togusa, another operative, reports that three more&nbsp;
scientists from Hanka were slain on the night of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.640
the attack in the company's central laboratory.&nbsp;
All of the victims have a sign of cerebral&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.760
hacking. Just like Dr Osmund, they were senior&nbsp;
figures. At the crime scenes, the same messages&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.920
were left by someone who identifies himself as&nbsp;
Kuze. The statements are the same as what Mira&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.720
heard from the geisha robot. Aramaki orders Togusa&nbsp;
and Ladriya to inform Cutter of the situation,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.200
while Mira and Batou find out what is recovered&nbsp;
from the geisha. Aramaki privately talks to Mira&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.120
about disobeying his orders when she was in the&nbsp;
building. She defends herself by saying that more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.120
would have died without her. He responds by saying&nbsp;
that she is his responsibility and that she is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:28.400
more than just a weapon built to hunt down rebels.&nbsp;
Aramaki reminds Mira that she has a soul—a ghost.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.560
Mira and Batou stroll through the streets; he buys&nbsp;
a piece of meat and feeds it to stray dogs, which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.640
he is deeply fond of. Batou asks Mira about her&nbsp;
parents in the car and tells him that her parents&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.400
died as refugees for trying to get into the&nbsp;
country. The boat sunk in the harbour before they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.040
arrived as rebels attacked it. She struggles with&nbsp;
recalling her memories. She sees another glitch&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.520
before they arrive at the headquarters. Mira meets&nbsp;
with Dr Ouelet frequently to repair her body when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:54.320
it encounters damages. She consults her Dr that&nbsp;
she sees flashes more than usual as of the moment.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:58.640
The doctor dismisses her hallucinations as&nbsp;
glitches caused by her injuries. But Dr Ouelet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:03.680
shows empathy and care toward Mira. The same day,&nbsp;
Mira and Batou meet with Dr Dahlin, dissecting the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.720
geisha robot's body. She informs the duo that the&nbsp;
hardware of the robot is vandalized and ripped up.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.640
Mira says she needs to do a deep dive into the&nbsp;
geisha robots AI to get more information about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.360
the whereabouts of the culprit. Meaning, she&nbsp;
will go inside its brain. Dr Dahlin warns her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:21.360
about being trapped in malware. Batou backs her&nbsp;
claim by saying that her mind might be exposed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:25.040
to whoever orchestrated the attack and be “open".&nbsp;
This can mean that Kuze might be able to control&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:30.000
her. She disregards their warnings and continues&nbsp;
to deep-dive into the robot's memory. Batou helps&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.680
her get ready as they start the procedure.&nbsp;
Mira gives consent to the doctor in terms of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.800
downloading her data. In a dream-like setting, she&nbsp;
falls, landing on the robot's memory. She finds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.720
herself walking through a club with distorted&nbsp;
images of several people that are slowly fading.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.960
She follows a path and sees Kuze. She feels&nbsp;
restrained, causing her to twitch on the surface.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:52.240
Multiple bodies drag her down, and Dr Dahlin&nbsp;
struggles to retrieve her. She gains consciousness&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.920
and says that she knows where to find Kuze.
Mira and Batou go to a nightclub with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:00.720
Ladriya for backup. She observes the club upon&nbsp;
entering and looks for any unusual happenings.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.880
Two men lead her into a private room. She and&nbsp;
Batou can still communicate without talking,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:09.040
using an advanced system that uses telepathy;&nbsp;
however, her signal suddenly gets blocked.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.960
The men in the room electrocute and force&nbsp;
her to dance for them. She is all on her own,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.960
as Ladriya and Batou cannot communicate with&nbsp;
her. The tension in the club rises as a man&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:21.440
points a gun at Batou at the bar. Mira fights&nbsp;
back and knocks down the men in the room. Batou&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.840
fires multiple shots, but he manages to shoot&nbsp;
the attackers. Mira heads to the backroom;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:30.480
it is dark and dingy. She kicks open a door and&nbsp;
sees an image of the burning hut. Kuze emerges&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:34.560
from the ashes and says the phrase "Cooperate&nbsp;
with Hanka Robotics and be destroyed" again.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:39.120
Mira sees several bombs attached to the walls;&nbsp;
it explodes, leaving her and Batou unconscious.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.880
While Dr Ouelet enhances her physical injuries,&nbsp;
she shares that Kuze seemed like he was waiting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.880
for her arrival. She also admits that her&nbsp;
glitches are getting worse by the day. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:51.440
doctor grows worrisome about Mira's well-being.&nbsp;
She has been inside the same Shell as Kuze, which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:55.680
might be the reason for her hallucinations. Batou&nbsp;
receives cybernetic eyes to replace his damaged&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:00.240
ones after the shootout. Mira visits him as he&nbsp;
shows her his new set of eyes. He reminds her to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:04.000
feed the dogs because he fears that the strays&nbsp;
would be terrified of his unique appearance.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.160
Mira happily does as he says. Meanwhile,&nbsp;
Cutter meets with Aramaki with anger over&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:12.480
Mira doing the deep-dive, saying that she is an&nbsp;
excellent asset to his company. Aramaki warns&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:16.160
Cutter who he is threatening since Aramaki&nbsp;
answers to the Prime Minister and not Hanka.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:20.720
Mira heads to the city's red-light district and&nbsp;
asks a woman if she is human. In a private room,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:24.880
she examines her by touching her face and asking&nbsp;
what it feels like. She is very much interested in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:29.440
the concept of humanity and their feelings. Kuze&nbsp;
makes his way to Dr Dahlin's lab; before killing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:34.640
her, he rips her eyes out. The following day, Mira&nbsp;
and Batou receive an incoming call from the car.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:39.040
Someone informs them that Dr Dahlin dies because&nbsp;
of another attack. They see her lifeless body with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:42.960
eyes plucked out. Mira pulls a drive out&nbsp;
of Dahlin's hand, which contains names of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:47.360
other Hanka associates, including Dr Ouelet,&nbsp;
who is most likely the next target of Kuze.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:52.160
That day, Kuze controls two sanitation workers to&nbsp;
ram their truck into Dr Ouelet's. The collision is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:57.200
intense, causing her car, along with the driver&nbsp;
and Ladriya, injuries. As their car is smashed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:01.120
in the street, one of the sanitation workers shoot&nbsp;
the driver and points the gun at the doctor, still&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:06.240
under Kuze's influence. Just in time, Mira and&nbsp;
a squad of soldiers arrive to rescue the doctor.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:10.160
The shootout lasts for a while. They manage&nbsp;
to bring down one of the sanitation workers.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:15.840
Mira and her partners arrive in time to shoot back&nbsp;
at the men. She chases after one man, Lee, who&nbsp;

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:21.120
can turn invisible. He runs away from Mira,&nbsp;
ending up in a body of water. She fights him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:24.320
while invisible, which is a struggle for&nbsp;
Lee. She recklessly hurts and throws him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:28.800
around. Mira desperately extracts information&nbsp;
about Kuze until Batou shows up and stops her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:32.800
saying that they need him alive. The section&nbsp;
9 team imprisons him in a glass cage as he is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:37.040
being interrogated. He informs Section 9 that&nbsp;
he was on his way to pick up his daughter.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:40.880
Mira shows him a photo of what he sees as his&nbsp;
daughter but is really a picture of himself.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:45.280
They ask him more questions, and his memory starts&nbsp;
to feel clouded. They conclude that Kuze managed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:50.160
to plant fake memories in Lee's head. In a matter&nbsp;
of seconds, Lee's body language begins to shifts.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:55.040
He displays a menacing smile; the team realizes&nbsp;
that Kuze is in his head, again. Mira enters the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:59.040
enclosure to communicate with Kuze. He speaks&nbsp;
through Lee to threaten Section 9 before making&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:03.840
Lee jump to hang himself with the cable around&nbsp;
his neck. Togusa manages to trace Kuze. Mira&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:08.080
him connected to a network with other humanoid&nbsp;
cyborg bodies. The team takes off and gets ready&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:13.040
to uncover the mystery of Kuze's real personality.&nbsp;
They get inside the premises successfully. Several&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:17.200
citizens vacate the area that is filled with&nbsp;
illegal activities. Another shootout happens,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:21.840
which sparks up instant chaos. Mira finds Kuze as&nbsp;
he is connected to a network with other humanoid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:26.720
cyborg bodies. They form a circle and seem to&nbsp;
form one common source of thoughts. Kuze is using&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:31.600
human minds to create a network of his own. This&nbsp;
makes him powerful as he can control his subjects.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:35.200
She investigates the place even more and&nbsp;
spots the burning hut image once again.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:38.480
A group of men attack her from behind and&nbsp;
electrocute her endlessly, causing her to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:42.880
fall to the ground. Kuze walks from a dark&nbsp;
spot and finally comes face to face with Mira.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:47.120
He connects her to his network, and reveals&nbsp;
himself and shows her his true form. Kuze stutters&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:51.360
as he talks. He admits that he was a test subject&nbsp;
of Hanka's but considered a failure and a freak&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.640
on his deformed outcome. Kuze says that Hanka took&nbsp;
control of their lives instead of saving them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:01.040
He then grabs a partial layer of Mira's exterior&nbsp;
to look at it closely and puts it back. She calls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:05.760
him a bad person, and he becomes more agitated,&nbsp;
threatening her even more. He disconnects her from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:10.400
the system and shoots him. He remains resilient.&nbsp;
Mira sees a tattoo on his chest of the burning&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:14.480
hut, like in her hallucination, and asks him&nbsp;
what it is about. Both of them seem to see the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:18.880
same image over and over again. Kuze tells her not&nbsp;
to take the medication that Hanka supplies for her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:23.680
because it suppresses her memories. According to&nbsp;
him, the Shell belongs to them, but not the ghost.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:28.720
His words make an impact on Mira. That night,&nbsp;
Mira confronts Dr Ouelet over her epiphany.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:32.640
She asks about how many fell victim to their&nbsp;
experiments. She asks about where her body&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:36.400
came from. Dr Ouelet reveals that they gave&nbsp;
her false memories to build her personality&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:40.400
and design what would motivate her to fight. Her&nbsp;
body did not come from a boat, and her parents&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:44.960
did not die the way she believed for years.&nbsp;
Mira is their first successful experiment. She&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:49.520
went off the grid to run away from the team. She
takes a swim to be at peace with her thoughts.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:53.680
Upon returning to the boat, Batou is there to&nbsp;
accompany her. She gets worried that one day he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:57.440
might receive an order to terminate her, but he&nbsp;
assures her that none of that will ever happen.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:01.280
She asks him to take her back to Kuze's&nbsp;
network. Cutter orders Dr Ouelet to get rid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:05.120
of Mira on account of her being a threat to the&nbsp;
company. She informs him that Mira knows enough&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:09.760
information to take defiance. The team tracks her&nbsp;
location and brings her back to the headquarters.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:14.320
Mira gets another episode of hallucinations of&nbsp;
experiments like her. As she lies sedated, Cutter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:19.360
wants her to shut down permanently. Dr Ouelet&nbsp;
opposes, saying that she can just reprogram Mira.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:22.960
However, Cutter stands by his decision&nbsp;
and is firm about getting rid of Mira.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:26.800
He hands a deadly substance that the doctor&nbsp;
must inject on her for deletion of her data.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:31.680
As Mira undergoes the process, Dr Ouelet gives her&nbsp;
an address instead to find answers for herself.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:36.000
Ouelet allows Mira to escape by unbuckling her&nbsp;
from the bed. Before she lets herself get left&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.160
behind in the lab, she hands a compilation of&nbsp;
Mira's memories so she can recall her past.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:44.480
Mira makes her way out of the premises by fighting&nbsp;
several members of the security team. She seems to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:48.400
gain more strength despite the process. Cutter&nbsp;
shoots and kills Ouelet from the glass division&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:52.720
in revenge. Mira strolls through the city on a&nbsp;
bike to make her way to learn about her past.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:56.800
Meanwhile, Cutter reports to Aramaki that Mira&nbsp;
killed Dr Ouelet and that she must be terminated&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:01.440
because she is a danger to them and the company.&nbsp;
This angers Batou and asks for Armaki's verdict.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:06.000
He responds by handing over a gun. Mira follows&nbsp;
the address; it reveals to be where she used to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.240
live in the past. The cat that she constantly&nbsp;
sees in her hallucinations comes to her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:13.840
The door opens and her mother, which she&nbsp;
has not found out yet, welcomes her inside.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:18.320
Mira observes the house closely and feels a sense&nbsp;
of belonging inside the home as if everything she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:22.720
sees is familiar. According to her mother, she&nbsp;
had a daughter who ran away and was killed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:25.520
She only found out about her daughter's&nbsp;
death after the administration gave her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:29.200
the ashes and made her believe that Motoko&nbsp;
Kusanagi, her daughter, took her own life.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:33.360
However, she doubts this because she knows that&nbsp;
her daughter was happy and contented with living&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:37.280
simply. Her mother does sense a familiar look in&nbsp;
Mira's eyes when she looks at her and says that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:42.320
she reminds her of Motoko. Mira leaves, confused&nbsp;
with her emotions. She reconnects with Aramaki to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:46.960
explain that she is an experiment and that Kuze is&nbsp;
just like her. Aramaki informs her that Dr Ouelet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:51.600
is dead. Mira stops for a moment and grieves for&nbsp;
her death. He also lets her know that Cutter says&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:55.280
she killed her, though they both know the truth.&nbsp;
They both know that Cutter is eavesdropping on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:59.600
their conversation, but they allow this to happen&nbsp;
as they plan their next move. Aramaki gets in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:04.400
car in the pouring rain and instructs the team to
switch to mind communications. After relaying the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:09.200
message, men shoot at Aramaki's car; he pretends&nbsp;
to be hit. As they get closer, he fights back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:13.440
and survives the attack. He manages to bring&nbsp;
down the three men with ease and composure.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:17.520
Cutter sends his men to kill Section 9 members,&nbsp;
but Batou and Togusa kill their attackers as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:22.080
Mira makes her way to meet with Kuze at a hideout,&nbsp;
which resembles the burning hut's structure.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:26.320
She recalls a memory that seems to be traumatic as&nbsp;
she feels a sense of familiarity with the place.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:30.000
A flashback reveals that she was actually&nbsp;
abducted from that specific place. They&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.760
finally piece together fragments of their memory&nbsp;
and wholly remember what happened that night.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:37.840
They remember that their real names were Hideo&nbsp;
and Motoko. They were initially fighting against&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:41.680
companies that turn humans into cyborgs.&nbsp;
All of a sudden, an explosion happens,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:46.560
leaving both of them unconscious. A spider tank&nbsp;
appears; it attacks Mira under Cutter's control.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:50.400
The spider tank hits Kuze and severely damages&nbsp;
himIt aims and shoots at her relentlessly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:54.720
but she manages to go to another level and find&nbsp;
the perfect spot to bring it down. The spider tank&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:59.360
approaches Kuze; ready to shoot him, Mira draws&nbsp;
fire at it again. It acquires target at her again&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:04.560
and sends a big explosive her way. The building&nbsp;
collapses totally, leaving it in flames. In the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:09.040
meantime, the spider tank grabs Kuze by the head&nbsp;
and lifts him into the air. Cutter now thinks that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:13.760
he is undefeated and calls him a freak. Out of the&nbsp;
ashes, Mira emerges invisible at first until she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:18.480
steps on the spider tank, to destroy it. She uses&nbsp;
all her strength to ruin the machine, even causing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:22.880
damage to her Shell and ripping her arm off. She&nbsp;
tirelessly destroys it until it finally explodes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:26.720
which causes injury to both of them. Kuze&nbsp;
offers to merge his ghost with her, saying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:30.800
that he will always be there for her no matter&nbsp;
what. She refuses, because according to her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:35.200
this is where she belongs, and this place is her&nbsp;
true nature. Moments after, Cutter's men from the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:40.400
overhead aircraft aim a shot at Kuze, instantly&nbsp;
killing him. Mira shouts in agony and sadness.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:45.200
Without her knowledge, Aramaki sends his own&nbsp;
man, Saito, to take down the sniper to save Mira.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:49.680
The aircraft crashes into the ground completely.&nbsp;
As they lay on the ground, Batou approaches them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:53.760
and recovers Mira, who is still alive. He is in&nbsp;
awe after seeing her still surviving despite the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:58.720
attacks. He asks Mira what her true name is, and&nbsp;
she responds by saying "Motoko". Batou helps her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:02.880
get up and recovers her strength. Aramaki then&nbsp;
confronts Cutter after having spoken to the Prime&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:06.800
Minister about tagging him as a criminal. Cutter&nbsp;
is charged with multiple crimes he committed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:11.280
against the state including Dr Ouelet’s death.&nbsp;
Aramaki contacts Mira through mind communication&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:16.000
and gets her consent to execute Cutter. He shoots&nbsp;
Cutter three times as he falls into his own pool.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.920
Mira sees her own grave for the first time. Her&nbsp;
mother accompanies her, and they are happily&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:24.960
reunited. She tells her mother that she does&nbsp;
not need to come to the cemetery anymore. Life&nbsp;

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:29.680
continues in the futuristic city. Aramaki still&nbsp;
gives the orders, the team assembles again,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:32.880
Operations with section 9 continue,&nbsp;
and Mira is ready for her next mission.
