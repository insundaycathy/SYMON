00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.200
Detective Recapped here. Today, I'm going to&nbsp;
explain a Drama-War film called: "The Beguiled".&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.240
This depicts the pitfalls of the different&nbsp;
kinds of desire through a lone soldier&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.720
finding himself in a school for girls.&nbsp;
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:17.440
Three years into the Civil War in Virginia,&nbsp;
1864, Union Soldier Corporal John McBurney&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.520
finds himself hiding in the woods, unable&nbsp;
to move because of his injured leg. When Amy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.800
comes across him while picking up mushrooms,&nbsp;
the little girl doesn't hesitate to offer him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.040
help. Amy tells McBurney that she can take him&nbsp;
to her school on the other side of the woods.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.040
With McBurney asking if there are any men there,&nbsp;
Amy explains that there are only two teachers and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.360
four other students at The Miss Martha Farnsworth&nbsp;
Seminary for Young Ladies. While Amy isn't sure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.880
if McBurney will be welcomed there as a Yankee,&nbsp;
she assures him that it's a better place than the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.800
forest. Clearly, Amy’s been taught well by her&nbsp;
teachers with how she helps a stranger without&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.640
question out of the goodness of her heart. Like&nbsp;
an innocent little girl, Amy doesn't even think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.560
about the danger that the soldier could pose.&nbsp;
All she wants to do is help a man in need, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:57.600
in times of war, help is hard to come by. With no&nbsp;
other choice, McBurney accepts Amy's invitation,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.080
and the little girl helps him as he walks. Along&nbsp;
the way, McBurney learns that Amy's teacher only&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.760
kept their school open because they don't have&nbsp;
anywhere else to go. When Amy asks him if he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.360
ran away, McBurney only tells her that he got&nbsp;
separated from his group after they got hit.

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.480
Upon reaching the Farnsworth Seminary, the&nbsp;
exhausted soldier finally passes out. Amy calls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.800
Miss Martha and the rest for help, and they’re all&nbsp;
ambivalent towards the soldier’s presence there.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.480
Still, they take him to the porch, where they&nbsp;
argue whether they should help him or not.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.240
Miss Martha orders Amy to get their blue rag and&nbsp;
tie it to the gate, which will let the patrol&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.720
know they've captured a live Yankee. However, Miss&nbsp;
Edwina thinks they should tend to his wound first,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.160
so Miss Martha says they'll wait until McBurney's&nbsp;
injury is healed before they decide what to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.320
do with him. They then take him inside, where&nbsp;
Miss Martha removes all the metal shards from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.480
his wound before sewing it. After tending to&nbsp;
the wounded soldier's needs, Miss Martha and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.560
Miss Edwina leave the room and find their five&nbsp;
students waiting for them outside. Amy informs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.320
them of the soldier's name, but Miss Martha says&nbsp;
his name won't matter since he'll be leaving soon.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.680
As Miss Martha cleans McBurney's body, Miss Edwina&nbsp;
and the students proceed with their sewing class.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.320
The bells ring, signifying the approaching patrol.&nbsp;
Miss Martha talks to the captain but doesn't tell&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.400
him about McBurney. Instead, she asks him&nbsp;
for an extra cartridge for her revolver,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.760
saying she'll feel safer if she knows&nbsp;
that she can use it. Despite Miss Martha’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.440
initial decision to turn McBurney over to the&nbsp;
patrol, her fright and reluctance affected her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.040
judgement. Her frequent glancing towards&nbsp;
the school is a small tell of her nerves,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.280
but she keeps a calm façade and gives nothing&nbsp;
away. Keeping McBurney there may be a problem,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.960
but she’s still curious and concerned, seeing&nbsp;
as she’s kept her mouth shut about him.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.120
Back inside the school, Miss Martha loads&nbsp;
her gun before hiding it again. Meanwhile,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.200
Miss Edwina scolds Amy for secretly talking to&nbsp;
McBurney. The girls are having breakfast the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.160
next day, and Alicia asks Amy how McBurney&nbsp;
is, to which Amy answers that he's fine.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.560
On the other hand, Jane is annoyed that she can't&nbsp;
practice in the music room because of McBurney,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.680
but Miss Edwina tells her that the soldier&nbsp;
will stay there for as long as he needs to.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.760
The teachers and the students carry on with their&nbsp;
regular activities, and when it's time for Miss&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.120
Martha to clean McBurney's wound, she makes&nbsp;
it clear to the man that she doesn't like his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.200
presence in her school. She asks him if he's not&nbsp;
afraid that she'll turn him over to the soldiers,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.200
and McBurney says he isn't. McBurney thinks there&nbsp;
are far worse things that could happen to him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.920
and he believes he would've been&nbsp;
dead already if it wasn't for her.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.360
In spite of McBurney’s expressions of&nbsp;
gratitude, Miss Martha remains cold and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.800
reminds him that he's not their guest but&nbsp;
rather a most unwelcome visitor. McBurney&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.480
understands where Miss Martha is coming from,&nbsp;
but he still tries to be friendly towards her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.000
When Alicia comes and asks Miss Martha if&nbsp;
she needs any help, the teacher instructs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.160
her to inform the other students that the music&nbsp;
room is off-limits. Before Miss Martha leaves,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.000
McBurney politely asks if she could give him&nbsp;
some soap and a razor. The tension between&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.480
McBurney and Miss Martha rises when the teacher&nbsp;
expresses how discomforted she is by his presence.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.880
Alicia, however, is very interested in the&nbsp;
corporal and finds ways to be close to him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:37.280
When McBurney is finally left alone, he chuckles,&nbsp;
showing that he's enjoying the attention he gets.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.560
One day, Marie visits McBurney in the&nbsp;
music room to bring him a prayer book,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.320
and she made sure to wear a set of pearl&nbsp;
earrings. When Marie leaves, Miss Edwina&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.800
sees her on her way out and asks why she's wearing&nbsp;
her earrings. The little girl tries to be smart,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.640
saying everyone has dressed up that morning,&nbsp;
but Miss Edwina wants her jewelry back.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.560
Marie then promises to return it, and when Miss&nbsp;
Edwina tells the girl to get back to her work,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.200
McBurney calls her. Despite her hesitance, Miss&nbsp;
Edwina enters the music room, bringing the razor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.800
and soap that McBurney asked for. While the&nbsp;
teachers and students are anxious because of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.480
McBurney, they’re still thrilled to have a man&nbsp;
in their school. It's not every day that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.000
ladies get to talk to a good-looking soldier,&nbsp;
so each one of them has their own strategy on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.840
how they'll be noticed by the corporal. Soon&nbsp;
after McBurney's arrival, the ladies have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.920
started to change the way they dress, even wearing&nbsp;
conspicuous pieces of jewelry just to stand out.

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.160
When Miss Edwina notices the soldier's dirty&nbsp;
nails, McBurney admits that he thought of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.320
burying himself in the middle of chaos in&nbsp;
battle. However, he failed, so he ran away&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.800
instead. Miss Edwina doesn’t find that brave,&nbsp;
and while McBurney agrees, he believes that what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.200
he did was smart and gave them a chance to meet&nbsp;
each other. As she cleans his wound, Miss Edwina&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.960
shares that her father is from Richmond, and she&nbsp;
left Savannah when she was young. Fascinated,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.960
McBurney keeps asking Miss Edwina questions about&nbsp;
her life, wondering how someone like her ended&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.880
up in that school. McBurney thinks she's waiting&nbsp;
for a sweetheart to return from the war, but Miss&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.960
Edwina tells him she doesn't have anyone in the&nbsp;
military. Being bold, McBurney tells her that he's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.200
never come across such beauty as hers. He then&nbsp;
takes her hand and asks what her greatest wish is,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:01.200
and Miss Edwina admits that she wishes someone&nbsp;
would take her away from that place. A little&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.640
embarrassed, the teacher leaves and lingers&nbsp;
outside the room, trying to gather herself.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:09.120
Miss Edwina is on her guard the whole time she's&nbsp;
talking to McBurney, barely meeting the soldier's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.600
eyes and careful not to stir her feelings. On&nbsp;
the other hand, McBurney boldly displays his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:18.400
attraction towards her, making the teacher uneasy.&nbsp;
As Miss Edwina remains by the door, it is apparent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.680
that she's trying so hard to restrain herself&nbsp;
from doing anything she might regret later.

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:26.240
During their evening prayer, Alicia excuses&nbsp;
herself and asks Miss Martha if she could use&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.640
the bath closet. However, instead of going there,&nbsp;
she heads to the music room and finds McBurney&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:34.880
sleeping. Without hesitation, Alicia kisses&nbsp;
McBurney on the lips and wakes him up before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:38.880
quickly going back to join the others in their&nbsp;
prayer. As Alicia's curiosity gets the best of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.720
her, it becomes clear that she’ll do anything to&nbsp;
get McBurney's attention. Unwilling to leave any&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.640
room for competition, she audaciously makes the&nbsp;
first move on the corporal before the other girls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:51.760
can. Luckily for Alicia, she manages to pique the&nbsp;
corporal's interest. The next day, while having&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:55.840
dinner, the teachers and students discuss what&nbsp;
they might learn while McBurney stays with them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.280
Alicia says the sight of McBurney will remind them&nbsp;
that there's something else in the world beyond&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:03.200
their lessons, but Miss Martha disagrees with her,&nbsp;
saying that learning lessons at a young age can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:07.360
help them attain a calm and happy life. When it's&nbsp;
Jane's turn to talk, she tells them that McBurney&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.960
will constantly remind them that the war is still&nbsp;
going on and they should keep praying. The other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:14.800
girls share their thoughts, too, and when Miss&nbsp;
Edwina says she finds McBurney to be a sensitive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:19.200
person, Miss Martha asks her to share more of&nbsp;
her findings with them. Miss Martha then informs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:23.360
them that they will join the corporal after dinner&nbsp;
for a prayer, and everyone agrees with her. Here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.760
it is apparent that Alicia and Miss Edwina both&nbsp;
have their eyes set on McBurney. From the way they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:31.760
talk about him, it is undeniable that they like&nbsp;
the man. Although the other students are curious&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:36.080
about McBurney, too, they don't speak of him with&nbsp;
such adoration the way Alicia and Miss Edwina do.

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:39.440
After dinner, the teachers and the students&nbsp;
head to the music room to share a prayer with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:42.960
the soldier. Miss Martha then asks Jane&nbsp;
to play the piano for them, and before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:47.280
the girls start singing, McBurney praises her&nbsp;
for playing beautifully. As the students sing,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:50.800
the two teachers can't help but feel a&nbsp;
bit distracted by McBurney's presence.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:54.800
All of a sudden, they hear a loud pounding on&nbsp;
the door, and Miss Martha instructs Miss Edwina&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:59.040
to stay with the girls while she checks who their&nbsp;
visitor is. Before leaving, Miss Martha also adds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:02.320
that she'll rap on the door three times to let&nbsp;
them know if it's the enemy soldiers at their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:05.840
gates, and Miss Edwina says they'll go to the&nbsp;
woods and meet her there if that's the case.

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:09.760
Amy is concerned about McBurney, but Miss Martha&nbsp;
says he'll have to stay behind since he's not well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:13.840
yet. Miss Martha leaves for a while, and when she&nbsp;
returns, she assures everyone that the soldiers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:17.520
are two of their own, and they have offered them&nbsp;
their assistance. The soldiers are eating some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:20.880
food in the kitchen, and Miss Martha tells the&nbsp;
ladies that she hasn’t informed the soldiers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:25.280
about McBurney yet. Once again, Miss Martha had&nbsp;
her chance to tell the soldiers about McBurney,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:29.440
but she didn’t. Instead, she lets them inside&nbsp;
her school, acting as if she's not harboring a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:33.520
deserter. Whether Miss Martha is letting McBurney&nbsp;
stay with them out of her kindness or guilt,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:36.480
Miss Edwina and the girls sure are&nbsp;
relieved that McBurney isn't leaving yet.

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:39.840
However, Miss Martha intends to ask the&nbsp;
soldiers to take McBurney with them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:44.160
and Amy is quick to protest, saying McBurney&nbsp;
can’t ride without hurting his leg. Miss Martha&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:47.360
says she'll tell the soldiers that McBurney is&nbsp;
still injured and just ask them to come back,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:50.880
but that will take a long time. After arguing&nbsp;
over what they should do with their visitor,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:55.040
Miss Martha makes the final decision of letting&nbsp;
McBurney stay with them only until he's recovered.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:59.120
Defeated, the girls agree with Miss Martha's&nbsp;
plan, and they all go back to their rooms.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:02.560
Before leaving McBurney alone, Miss Martha&nbsp;
asks him if he'd like to join her for a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:06.240
brandy when she returns, and McBurney says&nbsp;
he'd like that very much. Being the one to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:10.240
find McBurney in the woods, Amy expresses&nbsp;
the most genuine concern about the corporal.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:13.680
She is worried about what will happen to him,&nbsp;
and it's not because she likes him romantically,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:16.800
but because she considers him to be&nbsp;
her friend. When all the girls retire&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:20.720
for the night, McBurney eventually shows his&nbsp;
disappointment about Miss Martha's decision.

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:24.480
When the two soldiers finally leave, the girls&nbsp;
quietly discuss how long they think McBurney&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:28.720
will stay with them. Meanwhile, Miss Martha and&nbsp;
McBurney talk about the girls' life at school,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:32.880
with McBurney expressing his admiration for&nbsp;
her dedication to them. Miss Martha admits that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:36.400
although she gets tired sometimes, she believes&nbsp;
that she needs to give the girls what they need&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:40.720
to survive in the war. Out of the blue, McBurney&nbsp;
asks Miss Martha if she had anyone before the war,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:44.880
and the teacher says she did. McBurney doesn't&nbsp;
push Miss Martha to talk about that person,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:49.680
but instead, he just apologizes to her. He then&nbsp;
tells her that he was a coward to leave, but Miss&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:53.840
Martha isn't judging him. McBurney shares that he&nbsp;
was fresh off the boat from Dublin when he took&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:58.160
$300 to take another man's place, but Miss Martha&nbsp;
understands him and says everyone has done things&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:01.680
out of their character. Miss Martha says she'll&nbsp;
see to it that he'll find his way home, and even&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:05.920
though he clearly doesn't want to leave, McBurney&nbsp;
keeps quiet about it. During their conversation,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:09.600
McBurney tries to win Miss Martha over by&nbsp;
repeatedly complimenting her about her work,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:13.680
but he fails. He then tries to get her sympathy&nbsp;
by saying he only joined the war so he could&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:18.000
have some money, but that doesn't work, too.&nbsp;
Judging by the look on his face, McBurney is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.760
fighting the urge to tell Miss Martha that he&nbsp;
has no intention of fighting in the war again.

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:26.560
In the morning, Amy provides a cane for McBurney,&nbsp;
and he is grateful for it. As he practices walking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:30.640
around, Amy calls Miss Martha to show what she's&nbsp;
done for the corporal, and Miss Martha tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:35.920
McBurney not to force himself. When McBurney loses&nbsp;
his balance, Miss Martha catches him just in time.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:39.920
McBurney then asks Amy to help him go outside, and&nbsp;
on their way out, Alicia reminds the young girl&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:43.920
that it's her turn in the kitchen garden. When Amy&nbsp;
says she's helping the corporal, Alicia offers to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:48.480
relieve her, but Miss Martha tells them to stop&nbsp;
arguing. Once outside, McBurney notices that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:53.040
roses need pruning and volunteers to do it, but&nbsp;
Miss Martha won't let him. Amy then asks if he's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:56.720
had gardening experience, and when the corporal&nbsp;
says he's done a bit of it, Miss Martha resigns&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:01.120
and asks him to assist them when he recuperates.&nbsp;
Thankful, McBurney says he'll be happy to do it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:05.600
and Amy and Miss Martha go back inside. McBurney's&nbsp;
injury doesn't stop him from attaining his goal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:09.680
of staying there. His insistence on helping Miss&nbsp;
Martha with her garden is just the front he puts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:14.080
to hide his cowardice to leave, and the teacher&nbsp;
sees right through him. However, Miss Martha still&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:18.080
lets him do what he wants, and the corporal must&nbsp;
be relieved that he finally has a reason to stay.

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:22.000
McBurney starts working in the garden as soon&nbsp;
as he feels better. Late in the afternoon,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.080
Miss Martha thanks McBurney for his hard work in&nbsp;
the garden. She then asks to see his wounded leg,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:29.120
and after checking it, she tells&nbsp;
McBurney that he's almost healed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:32.320
McBurney asks if she wants him to go,&nbsp;
and even though she says she doesn't,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:36.160
Miss Martha thinks it would be better if he&nbsp;
leaves by the end of the week. Surprised,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:40.320
McBurney asks Miss Martha where he should go, but&nbsp;
the teacher says that's entirely his business.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:44.000
He then expresses his desire to just stay there&nbsp;
and tend to their garden, but the teacher can’t be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.880
swayed. Just when McBurney thought he's safe, his&nbsp;
plan is suddenly jeopardized. This time, McBurney&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:53.600
fails to maintain his composure, revealing his&nbsp;
temperamental side. Once again, he tries to reason&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:57.360
with the teacher to let him stay, only proving&nbsp;
how scared he is to go back to the outside world.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:02.320
Inside the school, Amy informs Alicia and Emily&nbsp;
that Miss Martha has asked McBurney to leave,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:06.400
making the girls feel sad and worried. They then&nbsp;
think of ways to stop McBurney's departure from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:09.840
happening, like suggesting to Miss Martha&nbsp;
that the corporal join them for dinner.

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:12.880
When Miss Edwina visits McBurney in&nbsp;
the music room, the corporal boldly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:16.560
tells her that he misses being near her. Miss&nbsp;
Edwina tells him she doesn't want him to go,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:20.800
and McBurney holds her hand, confessing that&nbsp;
he loves her. Confused, Miss Edwina asks him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:24.320
not to say that unless he means it, but the&nbsp;
corporal insists he's telling the truth. He’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:28.160
felt this way from the moment they spoke, but he&nbsp;
was afraid that Miss Edwina might push him away.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:32.400
He confesses to being a tired man who’s tired&nbsp;
of the war, and he just wishes to see the West.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:35.920
Miss Edwina says that her father can help him&nbsp;
once he goes to Richmond, and McBurney asks her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:40.400
to come with him. Unable to control herself, Miss&nbsp;
Edwina gives in to the soldier's charms and kisses&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:44.960
him. But they are interrupted by Alicia, who asks&nbsp;
McBurney to join them for supper. In a desperate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:49.120
move, McBurney used Miss Edwina's affection for&nbsp;
him just so he could stay there. The teacher,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:52.480
unfortunately, fell for the corporal's&nbsp;
sweet words easily. Clearly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:56.240
she’s been lonely for so long that she would&nbsp;
instantly believe a stranger’s words. Miss&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:59.760
Edwina is so infatuated with McBurney that&nbsp;
she fails to see him for who he really is.

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:03.760
Everyone dresses up nicely for dinner, and&nbsp;
the girls continue to vie for the corporal's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:08.240
attention. After eating, McBurney asks Miss&nbsp;
Edwina if he could see her later in the evening,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:12.320
but before she could answer, Miss Martha&nbsp;
invites him to join her in having some digestif.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:16.240
As they talk, McBurney once again expresses&nbsp;
his desire to stay with them as their gardener,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:20.800
but Miss Martha doesn't say anything. When it's&nbsp;
finally time for bed, Miss Martha takes McBurney&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:25.120
to his room, and the two almost kissed if it isn’t&nbsp;
for the girls' noise. Miss Martha then takes her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:29.120
leave, and once everyone is asleep, Miss Edwina&nbsp;
puts on a nice nightgown and makes herself look&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:34.240
presentable as she waits for McBurney. However,&nbsp;
McBurney doesn't show up. When Miss Edwina decides&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:38.320
to look for him, she finds the corporal in&nbsp;
Alicia's bed. Hurt, Miss Edwina backs away&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:42.240
from McBurney as he tries to explain himself,&nbsp;
only to push him down the stairs by accident.

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:46.080
Alerted by the commotion, everyone gets out&nbsp;
of their rooms, and Miss Martha realizes that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:49.760
McBurney has broken his already-injured leg.&nbsp;
With Miss Martha asking to know what happened,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:54.000
Alicia lies about McBurney attacking her and Miss&nbsp;
Edwina fighting him off. Believing Alicia's story,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.520
Miss Martha asks the girls to help her&nbsp;
carry the soldier to the table. Once there,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:01.120
Miss Martha orders the students to return to&nbsp;
their rooms before informing Miss Edwina that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:05.040
they need to cut McBurney's leg. Although Miss&nbsp;
Edwina vehemently disagrees with Miss Martha,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:08.960
she obeys her and leaves the room to fetch the&nbsp;
things they need for the amputation. This isn’t&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:12.400
the first time Alicia shows that she's willing&nbsp;
to go to great lengths to get what she wants,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:16.800
especially when she feels threatened. When she saw&nbsp;
McBurney focusing his attention on Miss Edwina,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:20.960
she made sure that the corporal will come to her&nbsp;
bed instead of the teacher's. Sadly for the three,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:24.400
their strong desire for one another is so&nbsp;
rotten that it led to a horrible accident.

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:28.880
The next day, McBurney wakes up and realizes&nbsp;
that his leg has been amputated. His screams&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:33.120
bring Miss Edwina to his room, and as she tries to&nbsp;
talk to him, McBurney accuses her and Miss Martha&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:37.280
of punishing him for not going to their rooms&nbsp;
instead. Miss Edwina expresses how sorry she is,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:40.960
and even though Miss Martha insists that the&nbsp;
amputation saved his life, the corporal won't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:45.760
hear her. Enraged, McBurney yells at them to leave&nbsp;
and bring him something for the pain. As the women&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:50.160
leave, they make sure to lock McBurney inside the&nbsp;
room. McBurney continues to wail the whole day,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:53.520
and while the girls worry about what they should&nbsp;
do, Miss Martha thinks it would be unwise if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:57.760
they let him go. He could tell the other men of&nbsp;
their garden and cow and lead them to the school.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:01.600
Alicia then visits McBurney when he finally calms&nbsp;
down, but the man isn't in the mood to talk to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:06.080
her. He then demands Alicia to bring him the&nbsp;
key to his room, and when she refuses, he grabs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:10.480
her by the hair and eventually makes her do his&nbsp;
bidding. Finally, with McBurney unravelling, he’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:15.120
starting to show his true colors. He isn’t the&nbsp;
charming man everyone thought he was. Of course,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:18.880
losing a leg is a tragedy for most people,&nbsp;
but McBurney is so self-absorbed that he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:22.400
believes his amputation to be a conspiracy&nbsp;
against him by bitter and jealous women.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:27.120
Still, Alicia keeps visiting the corporal in his&nbsp;
room, proving she's unbothered by his outbursts.

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:31.840
Later on, as Jane goes down the stairs, McBurney&nbsp;
asks her to come into his room. Although she's a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:35.760
little scared, Jane listens to McBurney as he begs&nbsp;
her to put a good word for him with Miss Martha&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:40.080
and the others. McBurney wants Jane to ask Miss&nbsp;
Martha to let him stay, and when Jane says she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:44.320
will, she hurriedly leaves and locks the door.&nbsp;
Later that day, McBurney manages to escape from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:48.080
his room and get a gun. With the girls frightened,&nbsp;
Miss Martha tells McBurney that they will assist&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:51.120
him as he leaves, but the corporal makes it&nbsp;
clear that he'll only go when he wants to.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:55.600
He keeps claiming that Miss Edwina pushed him&nbsp;
off the stairs, and Miss Martha amputated his leg&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:59.920
because he didn't visit them in their rooms that&nbsp;
night. Amy tries to calm him down, but the soldier&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:04.400
has changed, and he even throws Amy's pet turtle&nbsp;
away. He then starts drinking and breaking stuff,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:08.800
and when he leaves, Miss Martha instructs Amy&nbsp;
to tie the blue rag to the gate. Unfortunately,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:13.440
McBurney catches Amy and chases her into the&nbsp;
woods. McBurney must've felt betrayed, for Amy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:17.440
was the first person among the ladies to show him&nbsp;
kindness. He probably doesn't expect the little&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:21.360
girl to turn against him because she's always been&nbsp;
the one to stand up for him against Miss Martha.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:25.520
Even though he genuinely likes Amy, McBurney&nbsp;
is forced to stop her from doing her task.

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:29.920
The girl screams, and Miss Martha goes to check&nbsp;
on her. To her horror, Miss Martha finds Amy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:34.000
with McBurney in the barn. With the corporal&nbsp;
threatening her with a gun, Miss Martha asks him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.240
to join them inside the school. There, McBurney&nbsp;
orders everyone to sit down before promising them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:42.640
he meant them no harm. He’s pained and frustrated&nbsp;
over his amputated leg, and he asserts that he’d&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:46.560
rather be dead than be a man without a leg. He&nbsp;
asks Miss Martha why she didn't just kill him when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:50.640
she got the chance, and when she doesn't answer,&nbsp;
he tells them how much he regrets trusting them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:53.840
He then threatens to shoot anyone who&nbsp;
disobeys him, and as he's about to leave,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:58.240
McBurney shoots down the chandelier just to prove&nbsp;
a point. Miss Edwina tries to go after McBurney,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:02.560
but when Miss Martha stops her, she pushes her&nbsp;
to the couch and goes to McBurney's room. Miss&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:07.120
Edwina blocks the door with a table before making&nbsp;
a move on McBurney. The man pins her to the floor,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:10.880
and he makes love to her. Meanwhile, Miss&nbsp;
Martha and the girls continue to think of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:14.960
how they'll get rid of the corporal, and Marie&nbsp;
suggests they serve him with poisoned mushrooms.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:18.880
It’s incredible to see the effects a single man&nbsp;
could have on these girls’ lives. After all that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:22.800
McBurney’s done and shown them, Miss Edwina’s&nbsp;
affection for him doesn’t change. She even&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:26.480
disregards Miss Martha's wish that she stay away&nbsp;
from the soldier, showing that she's done obeying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:30.720
Miss Martha's orders. And now, the students and&nbsp;
Miss Martha were forced to come up with their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:35.360
plan, proving that a dangerous situation can force&nbsp;
a good person's hand to do something unimaginable.

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:38.800
During dinner, McBurney gets himself&nbsp;
a serving of the poisoned mushrooms.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:42.160
Miss Edwina’s also about to eat&nbsp;
them, but Amy manages to stop her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:45.760
As soon as McBurney eats the mushrooms,&nbsp;
he starts having difficulty breathing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:49.680
It isn’t long before he collapses on the floor&nbsp;
and dies. Miss Edwina looks at Miss Martha and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:53.840
the girls, bewildered over what happened, but&nbsp;
they don't seem to be bothered at all. Later on,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:58.400
Amy ties the blue rag to the gate then helps the&nbsp;
other girls sew a shroud for McBurney's body. Miss&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:02.320
Edwina mourns the death of the corporal, but she&nbsp;
doesn't say a word about it. When they're finally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:06.240
done, the teachers and the girls place McBurney's&nbsp;
body outside their gate for the patrol to see.

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:10.960
In the end, The Beguiled shows us that God-fearing&nbsp;
women aren't always weak and innocent. They can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:15.040
be fearless and manipulative, too, especially&nbsp;
when they have their backs against the wall. On&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:20.240
the other hand, not all men are brave. They, too,&nbsp;
can be cowards, who will do anything to survive.

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:24.240
Still, war is a force of its own that can&nbsp;
distort people into unrecognizable iterations&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:28.240
of themselves. It fuels simple desires&nbsp;
and twists them into something terrifying.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:31.440
From McBurney desiring to live in peace&nbsp;
away from the war to the girls’ desiring to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:35.200
experience something beyond the limbo of their&nbsp;
school, everyone just wanted something more.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:38.720
But at the end of it all, McBurney still died&nbsp;
young, and the girls remained in their school.
