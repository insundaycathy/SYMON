00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:14.290
In 1963, teenaged Frank Abagnale lives in
New Rochelle, New York with his father Frank

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:17.610
Abagnale, Sr., and French mother Paula.

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:22.430
When Frank Sr. is denied a business loan at
Chase Manhattan Bank due to unknown difficulties

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:27.570
with the IRS, the family is forced to move
from their large home to a small apartment.

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.730
Paula carries on an affair with Jack, a friend
of her husband.

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.710
Meanwhile, Frank poses as a substitute teacher
in his French class.

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.440
Frank's parents file for divorce, and Frank
runs away.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.039
When he runs out of money, he begins relying
on confidence scams to get by.

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:47.789
Soon, Frank's cons increase and he even impersonates
an airline pilot.

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:53.389
He forges Pan Am payroll checks and succeeds
in stealing over $2.8 million.

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:58.920
Meanwhile, Carl Hanratty, an FBI bank fraud
agent, begins tracking Frank.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.790
Carl and Frank meet at a hotel, where Frank
convinces Carl his name is Barry Allen of

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.680
the Secret Service, and that he was also after
the fraud.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.300
Frank leaves, Carl angrily realizing a minute
too late that he has been fooled.

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:18.050
Later, at Christmas, Carl is still at work
when Frank calls him, attempting to apologize

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:19.430
for duping Carl.

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.490
Carl rejects his apology and tells him he
will soon be caught, but laughs when he realizes

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.010
Frank actually called him because he has no
one else to talk to.

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:33.270
Frank hangs up, and Carl continues to investigate,
suddenly realizing (thanks to a waiter) that

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.520
the name "Barry Allen" is from the Flash comic
books and that Frank is actually a teenager.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.820
Frank, meanwhile, has expanded his con to
include the identities of a doctor and lawyer.

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.790
While playing Dr. Frank Conners, he falls
in love with Brenda.

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:53.040
While asking her father's permission to marry
her, he admits the truth about himself and

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.990
asks for help with the Louisiana State Bar
exam.

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.240
Carl tracks him to his engagement party and
Frank is able to sneak out a bedroom window

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.410
minutes before Carl bursts in.

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.570
Before leaving, Frank makes Brenda promise
to meet him in Miami two days later so they

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.019
can elope.

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:13.019
Frank sees her waiting for him two days later,
but also notices plainclothes agents waiting

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:18.379
to arrest him; realizing he has been set up,
he escapes on a flight to Europe.

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:23.480
Seven months later, Carl shows his boss that
Frank has been forging checks all over western

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.510
Europe and asks permission to go to Europe
to look for him.

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.579
When his boss refuses, Carl brings Frank's
checks to printing professionals who claim

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:33.939
that the checks were printed in France.

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:39.060
From an interview with Frank's mother, Carl
remembers that she was actually born in Montrichard,

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.060
France.

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.739
He goes there and locates Frank, and tells
him that the French police will kill him if

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:46.340
he does not go with Carl quietly.

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.889
Frank assumes he is lying at first, but Carl
promises Frank he would never lie to him,

00:02:50.889 --> 00:02:54.840
and Carl takes him outside, where the French
police escort him to prison.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:00.480
The scene then flashes forward to a plane
returning Frank home from prison, where Carl

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.079
informs him that his father has died.

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:08.129
Grief-stricken, Frank escapes from the plane
and goes back to his old house, where he finds

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:13.349
his mother with the man she left his father
for, as well as a girl who Frank realizes

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:15.689
is his half-sister.

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:19.900
Frank gives himself up and is sentenced to
12 years in prison, getting visits from time

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.169
to time from Carl.

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:26.819
When Frank points out how one of the checks
Carl is carrying as evidence is fake, Carl

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:31.150
convinces the FBI to offer Frank a deal by
which he can live out the remainder of his

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:36.310
sentence working for the bank fraud department
of the FBI, which Frank accepts.

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.469
While working at the FBI, Frank misses the
thrill of the chase and even attempts to fly

00:03:40.469 --> 00:03:41.680
as an airline pilot again.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.520
He is cornered by Carl, who insists that Frank
will return to the FBI job since no one is

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:47.520
chasing him.

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:52.170
On the following Monday, Carl is nervous that
Frank has not yet arrived at work.

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.791
However, Frank eventually arrives and they
discuss their next case.

00:03:54.791 --> 00:03:55.791
The ending credits reveal that Frank has been
happily married for 26 years, has three sons,

00:03:55.791 --> 00:03:56.791
lives in the Midwest, is still good friends
with Carl, has caught some of the world's

00:03:56.791 --> 00:03:57.791
most elusive money forgers, and earns millions
of dollars each year because of his work creating

00:03:57.791 --> 00:03:57.793
unforgeable checks.
