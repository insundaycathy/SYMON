00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:08.960
Welcome to the breakdown where we breakdown
all the messed up shit!

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.690
It's literally been over a year since the
last time I watched an anime movie or show

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:15.250
for this channel.

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:20.810
Corpse Party was the last anime and I had
probably 50 subscribers back then.

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:28.420
Now we at 192k subscribers and its time to
get back into to some universal animation.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:33.730
Perfect Blue is one of the anime titles that
has come out of the 90's age, a decade in

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.690
time that saw the sophistication of anime
as well as just more adult or mature themes

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:39.910
all throughout.

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:45.870
Perfect Blue is a big example of this, and
came out in 1997 directed by Satoshi Kon.

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.350
Perfect Blue is all about an ex J-Pop idol
named Mima who decides that acting is the

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:52.470
way to go.

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:58.540
Well not everybody likes this change in career,
including her ex fans, so she deals with both

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:03.450
the mental problems that come about because
of the pressures, as well as the psychos stalkers

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.379
around her that may want to kill her.

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:09.329
{First before we get any farther lets have
a word from our sponsor.

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:14.479
Today�s video is sponsored by Ridge Wallet,
the entity that created the minimalist flagship

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:18.560
wallet that sits comfortably in the pockets
of over half a million people worldwide.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:24.619
You see, I�ve been lugging this fat Marvel
wallet around for about two years now, gift

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:25.810
from granny right?

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.649
Well I like Marvel, but as the wallet got
bigger, Inotice how much BS I stuffed in my

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:32.539
wallet just to get it out of my sight!

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:34.569
The Ridge Wallet helps combat this.

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:39.409
You have to metal pieces bound together by
a strong elastic band, which looks nothing

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:42.439
like that suitcase we carry in our back pocket.

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:47.649
You can choose between Titanium, Carbon Fiber
and Aluminum and many different colors in

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:49.569
case you care about your material!

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:50.569
Me?

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:54.670
I'm using the titular Ridge Wallet in the
forms of the Cash Strap and the money clip,

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:55.670
which both came with a tool and screws to
augment the wallet.

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:02.039
Its great for holding case, cards, IDs and
also blocks any Remote RFID hacking in case

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:03.459
your cards carry an RFID chip.

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:05.079
Plus I also use the backpack which is quite
helpful for a student like me.

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:10.140
So, Ridge Wallet is again, a minimal 5 star
wallet that helps carry and protect what you

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.640
need, and leave the rest.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:17.110

Thanks for The Ridge Wallet for sponsoring
this video!

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.150
Oh yeah so what was I talking about?

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.710
} Oh yeah, So back to Perfect Blue.

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:46.459
As a reminder, I'm not analytical or whatever,
but I acknowledge the richness such a film

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:47.459
can hold.

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:51.480
If you want something more than a synopsis
then maybe check out the links in the description.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:03:03.109
If you wanna see what happens including all
the messed up parts stay tuned for the breakdown.

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:07.590
The beginning of Perfect Blue starts off with
a dramatic public performance of some fake

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.430
ass Power Rangers called Powertron.

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.010
They are the Power Rangers in this world,
but the audience is probably a lot older than

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.239
the usual young individuals.

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:22.939
A lot of people are really there to see the
performance of a J-Pop group called CHAM.

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:28.280
Many people though gossip about one of the
CHAM members named Mima, who seems to be making

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.609
an announcement near the end of the CHAM set.

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:37.670
Mima and her bandmates next get on stage to
perform after a very hectic preparation, then

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:39.080
title screen.

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:44.220
The song itself slaps though, you can listen
to it if you click on the "i" on the right

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.220
here.

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:50.420
One of the part time workers though has his
eye on Mima in the weirdest way possible.

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:55.810
That look is so fucking ugly, but Mima got
dodge moves like a wide receiver though.

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.810
The person who threw the can at her was the
leader of some group of delinquents.

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:05.499
The employee crawls over as Mima and the group
end their first song and begin their shocking

00:04:05.499 --> 00:04:07.499
revelation to the crowd.

00:04:07.499 --> 00:04:12.719
That's all interrupted though when the employee
gets his ass handed to him'by fuckin Trippie

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:15.939
Redd of all people, or Japanese Riley Freeman.

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:18.420
They just let him act crazy like this?

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:19.420
Where's security?

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:23.260
I expected secret service level for J-Pop
performances!

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.660
Ultimately, the employee does stop the rowdiness!

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:31.490
About damn time, this the guy she tell you
not to worry about, if you're insecure enough

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:32.490
to ask.

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:37.670
Anyway the reveal is that Mima is leaving
the CHAM group to start a career in acting.

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:41.110
She plays her last song as the intro goes
by.

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:45.100
This song fucking slap too btw here go the
link for your forheads.

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:49.720
Soon after the performance, Mima makes it
back through all the overwhelming environment

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.530
of being a star.

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:53.820
Despite being a star, she is pretty relatable.

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.320
Who doesn't lay in the bed like this?

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:01.680
As the view pans around, a radio broadcast
talks about an earthquake that killed at least

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:08.080
200 people, but Mima is more focused on putting
her idol past to bed, not wanting anything

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.700
to influence second thoughts.

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:14.980
She reads some fan letters, but one says "I
always love looking into Mina's Room!

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:18.780
I've put up a link to Mima's Room".

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:24.140
Mima just brushes it off, almost as much as
she brushes off her mommy's little protests

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:25.540
for her to keep being an idol.

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:30.090
Its her on the phone, but also some weirdo
calls her, doing nothing but breathing all

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:31.220
weird.

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:37.520
Even weirder, someone sends in a fax with
large characters all over caller her a traitor.

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.830
I guess for leaving behind the music group
to act.

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:45.590
Speaking of acting, Mima is later on a set
for a very small role.

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:50.560
She's playing a small part is some murder
mystery called Double Bind, but the pressures

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:54.770
start to get to her, everybody really sees
her as just that pop star.

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:57.810
The main actress on the set is Eri here.

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:01.430
Right before the scene is to start, an explosion
is heard.

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:03.880
One of the managers of Mima is injured!

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:04.900
Why?

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:08.940
Well because he was holding a fan letter meant
for Mima.

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:13.650
Someone is really not liking Mima's decisions,
but I don't think the letter was meant to

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:15.420
kill or maim.

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:18.100
Regardless of what happened, things go on
as usual.

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:23.220
You would think they would get law enforcement
involved, I definitely think that was a threatening

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:28.300
letter that should have got its own investigation,
but it was the injured managers idea to not

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:30.270
involve the police.

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:34.800
Right now Mima and her manager, Rumi are setting
up the internet.

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:40.210
The reason why is cuz that fan letter saying
"I've put up a link to Mima's Room" was actually

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:43.280
referring to a website called Mima's Room.

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:49.510
The weird part is that the website maker has
faked a diary as if Mima herself has wrote

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:50.510
it.

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:55.060
But as she reads it, she realizes that nobody
should know the info that's there, except

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:56.060
for her.

00:06:56.060 --> 00:07:02.000
I mean she laughed it off at first, but then
realized someone is really knowing her habits.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.440
The only two explanations is that someone
is really watching her, or Mima is really

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:09.440
losing it and not remembering any of this.

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:11.590
Mima starts to believe the latter.

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:16.740
Soon after, Mima complete the one liner scene
that was interrupted because of the rigged

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:17.740
letter.

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:23.030
It's a pretty mature murder mystery that we
see here, yet Mima's little roles introduce

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:27.990
little faith in her ability to be successful
just as an actress.

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:31.580
Anyway, Mima has a panicking moment after
she leaves the train.

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:35.110
Its uz it reminded her of what that fake diary
was saying.

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:39.760
It described her literal way of leaving the
train which causes her to lose it a bit and

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:41.980
run out like she running from zombies.

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:47.110
She walks past the annoying fans waiting on
her, going to the manager building some floors

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:48.110
up.

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:52.670
While riding the elevator though, she sees
a little newspaper clip purposefully placed

00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:53.970
for Mima to read.

00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:59.800
It shows that leader delinquent has been in
a hit and run and is in critical condition.

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:04.700
Probably ran over by this stalker fan that
Mima should probably throw hands with by now.

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:10.040
With little options on gaining more traction
as a actress, Mima submits to the pressures

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:15.110
and agrees to be in a rape scene that is surely
damaging to her persona.

00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:19.970
It starts with her stripping in a club, only
to be grabbed and assaulted by the men around

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:20.970
her.

00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:26.120
Remember this is all acting, yet still just
being apart of a scene must be emotionally

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:27.440
hard to take in.

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:33.000
I know if I saw my favorite pop star being
raped, acting or not, I'd be just as sad as

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.000
Rumi here.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.450
It's this scene that causes Mima to confuse
reality with performance.

00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:45.270
After the scene and getting home, Mima goes
to feed the fishies, but they all died.

00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:51.880
Aww so sad, but uh Mima I don't remember you
feeding them since the beginning.

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:55.590
Nobody makes this much of a fit because of
some dead fishes.

00:08:55.590 --> 00:09:00.830
Really she's not reacting all crazy because
of the fishes, but just seeing them dead also

00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:04.630
made her sad about participating in that rape
scene.

00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:10.110
Despite being all gung ho about it like "Yeah
sure I'll do it, and it's the next step to

00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:14.330
being the Hokage!", she truly only did it
because there was so much pressure on what

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:17.980
she should do, and did it to not let anybody
down.

00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:23.260
The main individual that starts to eat away
at her and criticize her, is her past Idol

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:24.960
self though.

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:26.737
We will see a lot more of her later.

00:09:26.737 --> 00:09:32.170
We also see that creepy stalker fixing the
fake diaries on Mima's Room website.

00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:34.540
He may actually be following orders.

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:36.340
We will get to that later.

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:40.570
Even if he didn't, he records damn near every
thing she does.

00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:46.020
Mima herself believes the Idol Mima persona
is writing those diaries, and she is continues

00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:48.230
to hurt Mima's mind.

00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:51.450
Someone though is beginning a killing spree.

00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:56.690
One of the acting managers that suggested
Mima play in the rape scene is targeted in

00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:58.030
an empty garage.

00:09:58.030 --> 00:10:04.240
Baited by old Idol songs from Mima, we next
see him brutally murdered in an elevator,

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:06.110
eyes gouged out and all.

00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:10.890
Things are getting hectic around our main
character, cuz she is having lots of trouble

00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:14.370
defining whats real and whats fake.

00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:19.029
Usually people would at least know they tripping,
but Mima seems to believe her hallucinations

00:10:19.029 --> 00:10:21.520
of Idol Mima is a real person.

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:23.760
She's got some mental wounds.

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:28.500
The stalker also sees this Idol Mima as well.

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:31.860
He is tripping too which we will get to in
a bit later.

00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:35.800
Her hllucinations start ruining her average
days!

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:38.529
Injuring herself to chase this figment.

00:10:38.529 --> 00:10:40.900
But who knows if even that is real.

00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:45.390
Its equally confusing for both Mima and us
as viewers.

00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:50.310
She usually "wakes up" back in her bed which
I think gets progressively more cluttered.

00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:57.770
She also even begins to believe the fake diary
entries, saying yep I guess I went there today.

00:10:57.770 --> 00:11:03.980
So one of the things that Mima does in her
ex Idol exploits is get professional pictures.

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:08.910
Including some nude pictures which is a big
contrast from that idol image I believe.

00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:12.260
Her photographer here gets attacked by someone
for it.

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:16.460
Brutally stabbing him in the eye and chasing
the bloodied man all around his flat.

00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:21.980
He gets his killing wounds from the hidden
figure, who seems to reveal themselves as

00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:23.330
Mima.

00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:26.570
Killing him for ruining her "Idol" image.

00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:30.010
This is a pretty remarkable scene in the movie
itself by the way.

00:11:30.010 --> 00:11:35.290
Mima awakens again next, and even finds evidence
that she killed that photographer.

00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:39.470
Regardless of all that, we go back to that
mystery show Mima acts in.

00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:46.140
The scene in particular plays twice, firstly
as Mima literally plays herself.

00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:51.210
The character is the killer of the show who
is pretending to be "Mima".

00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:57.420
The second time the scene plays, Mima is actually
in character playing the true villain of the

00:11:57.420 --> 00:12:04.221
show, no references to reality yet still pretending
to be someone relative to the show, and she

00:12:04.221 --> 00:12:09.750
gets much needed applause for playing the
character and finishing production.

00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:11.940
This was real for once.

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:16.850
After the shoot, Mima walks to he dressing
room, but gets attacked by the stalker.

00:12:16.850 --> 00:12:19.190
This is definitely real I think.

00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:23.620
He speaks for the first time in the film and
he sound like a damn rat.

00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:29.540
Truly a leftover from one of the Lizards sick
experiments, he plans on killing Mima, believing

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:35.060
the one in front of his is fake and is ruining
the real Mima's reputation.

00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:38.960
The real Mima is the Idol Mima, which ironically
both Stalker and Mima see for some reason.

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:43.790
She fights back as best as she can, on the
set of the scene in which she played a rape

00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:44.790
victim.

00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:48.940
She grabs a hammer and smashes it across his
face, killing him.

00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:54.860
As she looks over, TV crews clap ahead, but
I'm sure this is just a hallucination.

00:12:54.860 --> 00:13:00.350
Her manager Rumi discovers her soon after,
and when she leads her to the scene, the body

00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:01.800
isn't there.

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:04.550
The body isn't there, but Stalker really did
die.

00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:06.170
I'll explain later.

00:13:06.170 --> 00:13:12.160
Rumi drives Mima back, but oddly tells her
that she is driving her back to "Mima's Room".

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:16.610
Its odd cuz she shoulda said, I'm driving
you back to your room.

00:13:16.610 --> 00:13:18.930
Mima's Room is the name of the website.

00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:21.140
And, she awakens in her room.

00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:22.140
Rumi is in the back.

00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:28.190
Mima tries to call the manager of hers, but
he's dead, as well as the stalker.

00:13:28.190 --> 00:13:32.040
Now the question is did someone move his body?

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:35.450
Mima has another hallucination next though.

00:13:35.450 --> 00:13:37.269
Or..does she?

00:13:37.269 --> 00:13:41.110
The reflection in the mirror shows a big boned
clone!

00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:47.480
This is the manager Rumi, dressed in this
Idol dress and pretending to be Mima as she

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:49.610
was during Idol days.

00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:52.410
I'll call her Idol Rumi.

00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:57.930
She is nuts too, and was apparently using
the stalker in much of his deeds.

00:13:57.930 --> 00:14:03.520
I guess everything the stalker did to scare
her throughout the film.

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:09.089
Idol Rumi herself though is I believe the
real author of the website, either that or

00:14:09.089 --> 00:14:15.660
she told stalker what to say, in addition
to murdering the two manager men.

00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:18.580
She attacks Mima and gets some stabs on her.

00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:23.710
She has to Nathan Drake across the complex
just to get away, like for real she was doing

00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:26.790
some Nathan Drake Lara Croft ass stuff.

00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:32.610
Also I know it look like Idol Mima/Rumi is
a fairy in her movements, but that's just

00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:35.300
what the running Mima is seeing.

00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:39.270
This reflection in the mirror proves just
that, big ass.

00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:44.360
Idol Rumi gets a stab on Mima with some random
ass umbrella she found, and chases her to

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:47.220
a stop right in front of a store.

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:49.710
In the window, she sees her reflection.

00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:55.640
Its like it helps her realize she is the real
true ass Mima.

00:14:55.640 --> 00:15:00.779
The windows or whatever get destroyed though,
and Idol Rumi says there can only be room

00:15:00.779 --> 00:15:07.160
for one Mima, but true Mima doesn't care about
all that anymore and knocks that wig off.

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:13.960
Not only does it expose Rumi, even having
her react by screaming randomly, but she stabs

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:19.190
herself in the neck on the exposed glass,
making blood shoot out everywhere.

00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:23.870
She crawls away in pain over to the street,
and puts that wig back on.

00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:29.220
This is a pretty iconic visual of this movie
as well, but crazy ass Idol Rumi sees a truck

00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:32.529
coming and think its just the spotlight of
being famous.

00:15:32.529 --> 00:15:37.110
I don't know how the hell Mima really just
saved this girl but like I said she pushes

00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:41.000
her out the way, getting grazed by the truck
a little.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.800
If one thing is for sure though, Mima's hallucinations
seem to be over!

00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:48.600
Then, some unstated amount of time passes.

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:51.290
Could be months or years.

00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:53.590
Rumi is in some kind of mental help facility.

00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:56.670
And guess who her main visitor is!

00:15:56.670 --> 00:15:58.110
Mima here!

00:15:58.110 --> 00:16:03.750
I wathed the sub version, but in the English
dub that I saw again, Mima comments that if

00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:07.089
not for her, I wouldn't be the person I am
today.

00:16:07.089 --> 00:16:10.980
Rumi still sadly suffers from a case of personality
disorder.

00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:14.060
Mima though appears to be successful.

00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:18.339
She's even got long hair now like the lead
actress Eri that she worked with.

00:16:18.339 --> 00:16:22.220
I guess maybe its saying she's on her level
of success now.

00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:25.990
Even some nurses outside gossip like OMG is
that Mima?

00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:27.810
No way Mima would be here?

00:16:27.810 --> 00:16:32.690
The movie ends as Mima gets in her whip, takes
a loot into her rearview mirror and talks

00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:38.040
to us watching with confidence, saying No
I'm the real Mima!

00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:41.400
I think that movie deserved some claps, it
was very interesting.

00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:44.750
I'm also quite happy they ended the film like
that.

00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:48.540
Now I'm sure there is some confusion on what
really even happened.

00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:51.860
I'm confused too trust me but I think I have
an idea.

00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:55.820
So Mima, her stalker, and Rumi are three different
individuals.

00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:56.820
Check.

00:16:56.820 --> 00:17:01.540
Mima begins to struggle mentally with all
the expectations and issues of her careers

00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:03.490
as a singer and actress.

00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:07.449
She goes kinda crazy with hallucinations seeing
herself as an Idol.

00:17:07.449 --> 00:17:11.699
These early hallucinations are different then
the final battle at the end because they are

00:17:11.699 --> 00:17:13.439
just that, figments.

00:17:13.439 --> 00:17:18.480
The only time the figment could actually hurt
her was when she was with Rumi at the end.

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:20.639
And so about Rumi and Stalker.

00:17:20.639 --> 00:17:25.610
I wouldn't have known this if not for other
sources, but it seems to be some kind of weird

00:17:25.610 --> 00:17:30.650
shared delusional disorder shared between
Mima, Stalker and Rumi.

00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:37.769
It seems likely that Mima got the delusional
disorder of seeing Idol Mima from Rumi I guess.

00:17:37.769 --> 00:17:40.669
And Then Stalker got it from Mima.

00:17:40.669 --> 00:17:46.590
That's why Stalker could see the Idol Mima
as well as Mima herself.

00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:51.840
Rumi must have just went nuts some time early
in the movie, maybe even before it started.

00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:59.259
So it seems that Rumi was the murderer of
both the TV manager and the Photographer,

00:17:59.259 --> 00:18:04.659
quite possibly the Stalker too but I actually
think she just hid the body or whatever along

00:18:04.659 --> 00:18:06.799
with the other manager she murdered.

00:18:06.799 --> 00:18:13.330
To recap all what I said, I think that..despite
being rare as hell, got a delusional disorder

00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:20.110
from simply being around Rumi as well as her
own experiences, and Stalker did as well.

00:18:20.110 --> 00:18:26.309
So you had three crazy ass people linked together
through hallucinations all just from existing

00:18:26.309 --> 00:18:27.739
near each other.

00:18:27.739 --> 00:18:30.929
I'm sorry if yall still don't understand but
that's just my guess really.

00:18:30.929 --> 00:18:36.669
So lets get on with the most disturbing moment
and most enjoyed moment in that SPOOKY STUFF!

00:18:36.669 --> 00:18:44.690
So lets get right into it, the most disturbed
moment is probably either the rape scene that

00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:45.739
Mima starred in.

00:18:45.739 --> 00:18:49.990
Usually its cuz rape is just a horrifying
experience to witnessj, but right now I'm

00:18:49.990 --> 00:18:53.929
saying t because it was the start of Mima's
delusions.

00:18:53.929 --> 00:18:59.049
If not that scene then probably the murder
of the photographer, he really was fighting

00:18:59.049 --> 00:19:00.679
to stay alive.

00:19:00.679 --> 00:19:03.749
The most enjoyed moment is probably the ending.

00:19:03.749 --> 00:19:07.730
Usually I say that because I'm glad a movie
is over, but this time I say that because

00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:11.149
Mima decisively took control of herself for
once really.

00:19:11.149 --> 00:19:16.770
She literally became so good of an actor that
she broke the film just to tell us that she

00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:22.179
aint dealing with no doubts anymore, no troubles
and that the real Mima is the one who goes

00:19:22.179 --> 00:19:23.179
forward in whatever she does.

00:19:23.179 --> 00:19:25.780
That's some true ass anime swag right there
that you see a lot.

00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:26.999
And that's it.

00:19:26.999 --> 00:19:31.759
I really really enjoyed watching this movie,and
despite getting a recap I implore yall to

00:19:31.759 --> 00:19:32.889
watch it yourselves.

00:19:32.889 --> 00:19:35.640
I gotta get through some more crazy anime
movies, in addition to the manga and comic

00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:36.640
series in January.

00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:37.640
Here on the left is Corpse Party.

00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:41.639
I made this video when I first started so
just don't mind if I say anything stupid or

00:19:41.639 --> 00:19:43.139
ignorant.

00:19:43.139 --> 00:19:49.149
Here on the right is Suicide Club, another
Japanese movie that talks about the pressures

00:19:49.149 --> 00:19:51.559
and anxieties of Japan going forward.

00:19:51.559 --> 00:19:53.429
Thanks for watching, SPOOKY OUT!
