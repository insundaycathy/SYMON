00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.770
Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.430
Today I'm going to explain a Sci-fi drama
film called The Butterfly Effect.

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:06.539
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:06.539 --> 00:00:08.349
Watch out and take care.

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:11.090
Evan Treborn has been suffering from blackouts
as a child.

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.219
He remembers nothing during those times, but
it often occurs during the most significant

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:15.840
moments of his childhood.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.050
Some of these incidents happened when he spent
time with his best friends Lenny, Kayleigh,

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.740
and her brother Tommy.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.310
His mother Andrea first noticed the blackouts
when Evan was just seven years old.

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.259
While Andrea was dropping Evan off at school,
his teacher, Mrs Boswell, asked her to stay

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:31.160
behind for a moment to discuss an artwork
drawn by Evan.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.440
While other children drew wholesome pictures,
Evan's work depicted a man holding a bloody

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.160
knife in his hand standing close to two lifeless
bodies of men on the ground.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.230
Evan doesn't remember creating the gruesome
drawing, so his mother decided to take him

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.719
to a psychiatric hospital for a checkup.

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:47.629
As they await Evan's neurological exam results,
Andrea expresses her concern to the doctor

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:50.110
that Evan might have inherited an illness
from his father.

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.100
The doctor suggests that Evan should start
keeping a journal to help him with his memory

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.370
loss.

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.110
Evan takes the doctor's advice and starts
writing down the things he is doing for the

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:58.110
day.

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.859
In the first entry of his journal, he notes
that he will be meeting up with Kayleigh and

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:02.840
Tommy for a playdate at their place.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.150
He also mentions that this would be the first
time he will meet their father, Mr Miller,

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.660
face to face.

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:11.330
While preparing to leave, Andrea becomes witness
to one of Evan's blackouts.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.910
She sees Evan in the kitchen holding a large
knife with a blank stare in his eyes.

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.901
When he asks the boy about the utensil, he
drops it on the floor and tells her that he

00:01:17.901 --> 00:01:19.450
can't remember.

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.250
When they arrive at the Millers, Kayleigh
tells him that their dad is shooting a movie

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:23.700
with his new camera.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.630
Mr Miller tells Evan that he is going to be
the star of the flick.

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.310
When Tommy complains about getting the starring
role, his father snaps at him.

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.560
Mr Miller asks Evan to promise not to tell
anyone else about the movie.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.770
After agreeing to keep Mr Miller's secret,
he blacks out and regains consciousness in

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:37.900
the basement.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.440
Evan finds himself in front of Mr Miller's
camera with his clothes on the floor.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.170
When Evan asked Mr Miller how he got there,
the man asks him to do what he's told.

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.270
He notices Kayleigh beside him, but she remains
silent even when he asks her what's happening.

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.510
Meanwhile, Tommy angrily twists the neck of
a doll while watching them from the stairs.

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.710
Andrea goes back to the doctor to ask about
the results of Evan's tests.

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.270
The doctor confirmed that the tests didn't
show any physical damage to his brain.

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.230
He asserted that stress might be causing the
blackouts and suggested that it could be due

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:05.510
to difficulties coping with his father's absence.

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.720
Andrea remembered that Evan had been asking
to see his father for a while.

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.760
The doctor tells her that a controlled meeting
between the two could help alleviate Evan's

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.870
stress.

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.890
Evan writes about the meeting with his father,
Jason, in his journal on their way to the

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:16.990
hospital.

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.130
He indicates that he is aware of his father's
mental illness, but the boy is still hoping

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:21.730
that he gets to call him "dad."

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.360
The doctor tells him that his father might
be a little sleepy because of the medication.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.580
When his dad arrives in the designated meeting
room, he immediately assures Evan that it's

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.390
safe to be with him.

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.760
Jason asks the boy if he had seen pictures
of him.

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.980
Evan starts telling his father about their
similar features, but he suddenly experiences

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.140
a blackout.

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.690
When he woke up, his father was strangling
him, saying, "I love you."

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.900
The guards rush in to the room to stop him.

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.960
During the struggle, a guard hits Jason in
the head with a baton.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.740
Jason falls to the floor, bleeding and lifeless.

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.910
Six years after his father's death, Evan and
his friends have now taken up smoking and

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.660
other questionable habits.

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.810
One day, while hanging out at the Miller's,
the group decides to blow up something with

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.290
a stick of dynamite to alleviate their boredom.

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.710
Tommy compels Lenny into blowing up a mailbox.

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:05.090
Lenny refuses, fearing that the explosive
might blow up too soon.

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.620
Evan steps in and stuffs the fuse into a lit
cigarette.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.060
He tells Lenny that the fuse should now last
at least two minutes before the dynamite explodes.

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.350
Lenny puts the dynamite into the mailbox and
runs back to his friends.

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.210
Evan covers Kayleigh's ears while waiting
for the mailbox to blow up, but he blacks

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:19.880
out before the explosion.

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.270
When Evan regains consciousness, they are
already running deep into the woods.

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:26.980
He and Tommy have been carrying Lenny, who
appears to be awake but unresponsive.

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.450
While Lenny is loaded into an ambulance, Andrea
asks Evan what happened.

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.120
Evan insists that he blacked out and can't
remember anything.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.930
When Andrea tells him that he can't use his
condition as an excuse, he tears up, convincing

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.209
his mother that he is telling the truth.

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:42.730
Sitting alone in the attic, Evan decides to
write down the incident in his journal.

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.440
His pencil breaks mid-sentence, so he starts
looking for something else he could use.

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.250
During his search, he sees a box labelled
with his father's name.

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.540
Inside, he finds a few pictures, and an envelope
marked "Dad's death certificate."

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.660
He looks at the paper and discovers that his
grandfather, Edward, was committed at the

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:57.960
Bellevue Institute.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:01.020
He concludes that his grandfather also had
a mental illness.

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:04.460
Evan has agreed to undergo hypnosis to remember
the incident that leads to Lenny's catatonic

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:05.460
state.

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:07.690
He remembers covering Kayleigh's ears to protect
her.

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.660
Evan recalls a car arriving but struggles
to tell the doctor anything else.

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:14.250
The doctor tries to convince Evan that he's
not in danger, but the boy remains agitated

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.120
and starts shaking violently.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.609
As his nose starts bleeding, the doctor decides
to stop the session.

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:22.860
Evan wakes up, not remembering anything about
the hypnosis.

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.650
Later on, Andrea drops off Evan at the cinema
to meet up with Kayleigh and Tommy.

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.750
When Evan asks his friends what happened to
the mailbox, Tommy shoves him violently to

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.380
the wall and tells him not to mention the
incident again.

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.340
The three friends go inside the cinema to
watch a movie, but Kayleigh leaves in the

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:36.690
middle of the flick.

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:39.700
Evan follows her and tries to console her,
but she winces in pain after he touches her

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:40.760
shoulder.

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:44.500
Evan sees the large bruise on her arm and
finds out that her dad had beaten her up.

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.380
He tells her that she doesn't deserve that
beating and kisses her.

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.380
Tommy sees them kissing and yells at them.

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.710
As he walks over to them, he is tripped by
an older kid, causing him to fall on the floor.

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.970
Tommy starts beating up the kid who tripped
him, but he stares angrily at Evan and Kayleigh

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:58.160
while doing it.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.820
Kayleigh and Evan look on in shock as Tommy
is being dragged away by the guards.

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:05.260
While washing dishes in the kitchen, Andrea
hears a news story about a dynamite explosion

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:06.840
resulting in a tragedy.

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.250
The news indicated that there are still no
suspects connected to the blast.

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:13.300
Andrea later tells Evan that they will be
leaving town soon.

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.590
Kayleigh and Evan find out that Lenny is now
at home, so they visit him.

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:19.630
As the three kids take a trip and walk out
in the woods, they notice a cloud of smoke

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:21.000
coming from a yard.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.030
They quickly run to the source and see that
Tommy has put Evan's dog in a sack and is

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:25.930
trying to light it up on fire.

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:28.570
Tommy quickly grabs a plank and tries to hit
Evan with it.

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:31.550
Evan manages to dodge it, but Kayleigh gets
struck in the head.

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:34.680
Tommy beats up Evan and tries to light up
the dog on fire again.

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:38.070
Evan gets up and charges Tommy, but he blacks
out before reaching him.

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:40.560
He wakes up to see his dog burned to cinders.

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.980
As Evan and his mom were about to leave town,
Kayleigh runs to their house, hoping to see

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:45.310
him one last time.

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:48.449
Knowing that they won't be able to talk, Evan
writes her a note, saying he'll come back

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:49.449
for her.

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:53.370
Evan, now aged 20, has decided to study psychology
in college.

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:56.650
One night, he asks his roommate Thumper to
celebrate with him because he hasn't experienced

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:58.300
a blackout in seven years.

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:01.639
They go to the bar for a few drinks and a
game of pool, but things turn sour when frat

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:03.930
boys start making fun of Thumper.

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:06.970
After leaving the bar, Evan goes back to his
dorm room with his date.

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:10.180
She sits on the bed and notices Evan's journal
as he grabs her a drink.

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:12.919
She convinces Evan to read a few sentences
from the journal.

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:16.370
As he reads, he starts remembering the incidents
described in his notes.

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:19.010
He notices his surroundings shake as he continues
to read.

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:21.860
Evan soon finds himself reliving the time
when he tried to stop Tommy from lighting

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:23.460
up his dog on fire.

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:26.770
Lenny was desperately trying to open up the
sack to free the dog, but he stops when Tommy

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:28.949
threatened to kill his mother in her sleep.

00:06:28.949 --> 00:06:32.490
Tommy castigates Evan for kissing Kayleigh
as he lights up the dog on fire.

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:35.260
Evan wakes up as soon as Tommy puts the fire
against the sack.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.990
His date tells he was just dreaming, but he
says that it felt very real.

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:42.810
Still bothered by the experience, he visits
Lenny to ask him what happened that day.

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:45.240
Lenny repeats Tommy's threat about killing
his mother.

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:48.950
Evan goes back to his dorm, convinced that
the incident he saw in his dream happened.

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:51.710
He reads from his notes again and goes back
to the time when they were blowing up the

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:52.780
mailbox.

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:56.620
He is stunned by the sudden shift in his surroundings
and drops a lit cigarette on his shirt.

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:59.731
As they observe a car arriving at the house,
Evan feels the cigarette burning through his

00:06:59.731 --> 00:07:02.389
shirt and onto his skin, leaving a burn mark.

00:07:02.389 --> 00:07:05.389
The owner of the house gets out of the car
carrying her baby.

00:07:05.389 --> 00:07:08.710
Kayleigh breathes a sigh of relief as they
see the woman walk toward her home, but relief

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:12.110
turned quickly into dread when they see the
lady walk back to the mailbox, still carrying

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:13.130
her baby.

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:16.430
They witness the dynamite explode as soon
as the lady opens the box.

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:19.880
Shocked by what he saw, Lenny stands frozen,
staring at the distance while the three others

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:21.130
run away.

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:24.229
Tommy and Evan come back for Lenny and carry
him away on their shoulders.

00:07:24.229 --> 00:07:28.380
When Evan wakes up, he checks his tummy and
sees the scar left by the cigarette burn.

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:32.030
Evan later goes out for dinner with his mother,
and he starts asking her about his dad.

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:34.310
Andrea tells him that Jason had a good memory.

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:37.320
She further reveals that Jason had claimed
to have found a way to remember his past when

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:39.110
he was the same age as Evan.

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:41.960
Andrea tries to tell Evan that Jason claimed
to have another ability but failed to say

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:43.180
what it was.

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:46.370
She noted that his father was already too
sick by that time.

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:49.950
After leaving the restaurant, Evan asks Andrea
again about Jason's ability.

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:53.580
Andrea changes the subject by convincing Evan
to try palm reading for fun.

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:57.360
As soon as the palm reading starts, the psychic
tells Evan that he has no lifeline.

00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:00.570
She further asserted that Evan has no soul
and was not meant to exist.

00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:03.900
Andrea later tells Evan that she had miscarried
twice before he was born.

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:06.820
She considered Evan her miracle baby because
she didn't have any problem giving birth to

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:07.980
him.

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:10.669
Back in the dorm, Evan goes through his journals
again.

00:08:10.669 --> 00:08:13.960
While reading through the part when Mr Miller
was filming him and Kayleigh, Thumper stops

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:17.510
him, arguing that there could be a good reason
he repressed those memories.

00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:20.979
Evan goes back to his hometown to see Kayleigh,
who now works at a diner.

00:08:20.979 --> 00:08:24.010
After getting reacquainted, Evan starts telling
her that he has been recovering some of his

00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:25.030
lost memories.

00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:28.020
When he asks her about the time Mr Miller
was filming them, Kayleigh got mad at him

00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:29.430
for bringing it up.

00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:32.030
Evan tells her that she shouldn't hate herself
for anything wrong that might have happened

00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:34.589
that time, but Kayleigh gets even more upset.

00:08:34.589 --> 00:08:37.870
Kayleigh tells Evan that talking about that
incident doesn't make her feel any better.

00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:41.110
As she walks away, she turns back to Evan
and asks him why he didn't keep in touch with

00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:43.309
her if he thought she was so wonderful.

00:08:43.309 --> 00:08:46.720
When Evan gets back to the dorm, he hears
an angry voice message from Tommy, telling

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:49.259
him that Kayleigh had taken her own life the
night they met.

00:08:49.259 --> 00:08:52.329
He goes to the funeral, but he only watches
it from a distance.

00:08:52.329 --> 00:08:55.499
After everyone had left, he leaves behind
some flowers and the old note containing his

00:08:55.499 --> 00:08:57.660
promise to return for Kayleigh.

00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:00.740
Evan starts reading from his journals again
to test his theory that his flashbacks really

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:02.639
allow him to change the past.

00:09:02.639 --> 00:09:05.751
After reading a few phrases from his notes,
he goes back to the moment when Mr Miller

00:09:05.751 --> 00:09:08.029
invited him to the basement to shoot a movie.

00:09:08.029 --> 00:09:10.949
As Mr Miller prepares the camera, he tells
the children that they will be kissing in

00:09:10.949 --> 00:09:13.890
the film, so he instructs them to take their
clothes off.

00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:17.679
Evan tells Kayleigh to cover her ears and
starts berating Mr Miller for his depravity.

00:09:17.679 --> 00:09:21.000
He warns Mr Miller that his activities would
eventually lead to Kayleigh's suicide and

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.619
threatens to castrate him if he doesn't stop.

00:09:23.619 --> 00:09:27.290
When Evan wakes up, he finds himself in a
girl's dorm room, and he immediately experiences

00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:30.569
flashes of memories that seem to have happened
after he confronted Mr Miller.

00:09:30.569 --> 00:09:33.899
Kayleigh wakes up beside him and notices that
his nose is bleeding.

00:09:33.899 --> 00:09:37.009
After getting cleaned up, he and Kayleigh
walk together to go to class.

00:09:37.009 --> 00:09:39.920
When Evan asked about Mr Miller's camera,
Kayleigh told him that her dad got rid of

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:41.769
it the same day he got it.

00:09:41.769 --> 00:09:45.420
While leaving his message for his mom on the
phone, he sees Thumper in the hallway.

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:48.949
When he asks him for the time, he finds out
that Thumper isn't very fond of him.

00:09:48.949 --> 00:09:52.949
He later learns that he is now friends with
the frat boys who bullied Thumper at the bar.

00:09:52.949 --> 00:09:56.160
Evan sets up a romantic evening with Kayleigh,
but the evening was spoiled when he hears

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:57.980
that someone has trashed his car.

00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:01.069
He and Kayleigh notice a dog collar hanging
from the rearview mirror, and they both figure

00:10:01.069 --> 00:10:03.459
out that it was Tommy who caused the damage.

00:10:03.459 --> 00:10:06.619
The couple goes back to Evan's dorm to find
something he could use for self-defense, but

00:10:06.619 --> 00:10:08.040
all he could see was a pepper spray.

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:10.899
Kayleigh assures Evan that Tommy wouldn't
hurt him.

00:10:10.899 --> 00:10:12.990
Evan reminds her that Tommy killed his dog.

00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:16.329
He argues that Tommy's bad behavior couldn't
just be a result of a bad upbringing because

00:10:16.329 --> 00:10:17.759
Kayleigh turned out fine.

00:10:17.759 --> 00:10:20.839
Kayleigh stressed that her father never harmed
her and asserted that Mr Miller had taken

00:10:20.839 --> 00:10:22.449
out all of his anger on Tommy.

00:10:22.449 --> 00:10:25.499
Evan decides to stay with Kayleigh in her
room, but Tommy confronts them as they walk

00:10:25.499 --> 00:10:26.759
to the dorm.

00:10:26.759 --> 00:10:28.869
Tommy starts beating up Evan with a bat.

00:10:28.869 --> 00:10:32.680
Evan manages to incapacitate Tommy with a
pepper spray and beats him while he's down.

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:35.959
After punching Tommy a few times, he grabs
the bat and hits him in the head, killing

00:10:35.959 --> 00:10:37.389
him instantly.

00:10:37.389 --> 00:10:39.429
Evan is sent to prison for killing Tommy.

00:10:39.429 --> 00:10:43.319
After entering his jail cell, he immediately
asks his cellmate, Carlos, for protection.

00:10:43.319 --> 00:10:47.459
Carlos, who is quite religious, refuses and
advises Evan to close his eyes and go somewhere

00:10:47.459 --> 00:10:50.459
else in his mind when other prisoners start
abusing him.

00:10:50.459 --> 00:10:53.880
Andrea pays Evan a visit to tell him about
the case and bring him his journals.

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:57.389
She was only able to bring two books as the
others are still kept in storage.

00:10:57.389 --> 00:11:00.970
Before Evan could even take his books to his
cell, other inmates take them from him.

00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:03.759
Evan was able to rip out a few pages from
the books before the other prisoners could

00:11:03.759 --> 00:11:04.990
take them away.

00:11:04.990 --> 00:11:08.360
He uses the pages he kept to go back in time
to convince Carlos to help him get the rest

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:10.160
of his journals back.

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:13.589
Evan flashes back to the day when he drew
the picture of a man holding a knife.

00:11:13.589 --> 00:11:17.179
He impales both his hands on pointed paper
holders to convince Carlos that he is experiencing

00:11:17.179 --> 00:11:18.209
stigmata.

00:11:18.209 --> 00:11:21.500
When Evan wakes up, Carlos sees the scars
and decides to help him.

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:24.170
Evan goes to the inmates' cell that took his
journals and asked them to let him join their

00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:25.170
gang.

00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:28.429
He agrees to pleasure them as part of the
initiation, but as soon as he kneels, he stabs

00:11:28.429 --> 00:11:29.499
them both.

00:11:29.499 --> 00:11:32.920
Carlos comes in to hold down the gate of the
cell as Evan reads from his journal.

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:35.970
He soon returns to the moment when Tommy was
about to burn his dog.

00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:38.850
He gives Lenny a sharp piece of metal and
persuades him to cut the rope when he sees

00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:40.259
the dog in the sack.

00:11:40.259 --> 00:11:44.009
When they reach the yard, Evan confronts Tommy
and convinces him to let the dog go.

00:11:44.009 --> 00:11:48.009
Lenny, however, walks toward Tommy while he's
releasing the dog and stabs him with the metal

00:11:48.009 --> 00:11:49.069
shard.

00:11:49.069 --> 00:11:52.329
Evan wakes up back in his dorm room and starts
convulsing as new memories flash into his

00:11:52.329 --> 00:11:53.329
head.

00:11:53.329 --> 00:11:55.660
He is taken to the hospital and undergoes
some tests.

00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:59.089
As the doctor explains the results to Andrea,
Evan interrupts him and asserts that he had

00:11:59.089 --> 00:12:02.129
inserted 40 years worth of memory in his brain
in one year.

00:12:02.129 --> 00:12:05.949
He steals a security key from the doctor and
goes to see Lenny in his room.

00:12:05.949 --> 00:12:08.740
Lenny just stares into space as Evan tries
to talk to him.

00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:11.649
As Evan was about to leave, Lenny asks him
if he knew that something would happen when

00:12:11.649 --> 00:12:13.360
he handed him the metal shard.

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:17.459
When Evan said yes, Lenny tells him that he
should be the one locked up in the psych ward.

00:12:17.459 --> 00:12:20.790
Evan decides to revisit the moment when he
met with his dad in the hospital.

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:24.339
During the meeting, he tries to ask his father
to tell him how he could make things right.

00:12:24.339 --> 00:12:27.410
His father tells him that it's impossible
because he can't change people without destroying

00:12:27.410 --> 00:12:28.720
a part of their identity.

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:32.029
Evan insists on using his abilities to make
things better, so Jason lunges at the boy

00:12:32.029 --> 00:12:33.860
and strangles him.

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:37.550
Upon his return from the flashback, Evan goes
back to his hometown to find Kayleigh.

00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:40.899
He tries to look for her at the diner but
finds out that she never worked there.

00:12:40.899 --> 00:12:43.459
Evan soon learns that she is now working as
a prostitute.

00:12:43.459 --> 00:12:47.100
He visits her at the motel, takes her to the
diner, and tells her about his ability.

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:50.779
Kayleigh refuses to believe him, so he goes
back to his dorm and reads from his journal

00:12:50.779 --> 00:12:51.779
again.

00:12:51.779 --> 00:12:55.470
This time, Evan uses his ability to stop the
woman from opening the mailbox.

00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:58.760
He runs toward the house and tells the lady
to stay away from the mailbox.

00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:02.069
Frustrated by Evan's decision to warn the
lady, Tommy shields the woman and her baby

00:13:02.069 --> 00:13:04.049
from the blast so he would come out as a hero.

00:13:04.049 --> 00:13:08.509
Evan, who is standing next to the mailbox,
gets blown away by the explosion.

00:13:08.509 --> 00:13:11.959
Evan returns to his dorm room and sees Lenny
on the next bed instead of Thumper.

00:13:11.959 --> 00:13:15.329
As soon as Evan realizes that he had lost
his limbs, he starts convulsing from the surge

00:13:15.329 --> 00:13:17.430
of new memories flashing into his mind.

00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:20.819
In those flashes, Evan finds out that Kayleigh
and Lenny have become lovers.

00:13:20.819 --> 00:13:24.200
He later meets Tommy, who is now a member
of a religious group.

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:27.249
While spending some time alone with Kayleigh,
he asks her whether they could've been together

00:13:27.249 --> 00:13:28.459
as a couple.

00:13:28.459 --> 00:13:31.230
Kayleigh tells him that he was the first person
he ever cared about.

00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:34.589
She went on to say that Evan was the reason
she stayed with her dad instead of her mom,

00:13:34.589 --> 00:13:36.800
even though she didn't like being with her
father.

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:39.609
Evan tells her that nobody could love her
the way that he does.

00:13:39.609 --> 00:13:43.189
Feeling depressed from losing Kayleigh to
Lenny, Evan tries to drown himself in the

00:13:43.189 --> 00:13:44.189
bathtub.

00:13:44.189 --> 00:13:46.119
Tommy saves him and tells him not to give
up hope.

00:13:46.119 --> 00:13:50.109
Tommy takes Evan to the hospital to see Andrea,
who is now suffering from lung cancer.

00:13:50.109 --> 00:13:53.290
Evan remembers from the flashes that his mom
had started chain-smoking after he lost his

00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:54.290
limbs.

00:13:54.290 --> 00:13:57.299
He suddenly gets the idea to go back in time
and destroy the dynamite so he doesn't get

00:13:57.299 --> 00:13:58.709
blown up.

00:13:58.709 --> 00:14:01.949
Evan fails in his first attempt to destroy
the dynamite and tries again.

00:14:01.949 --> 00:14:05.290
In his second attempt, he goes back to the
moment when Mr Miller was preparing to shoot

00:14:05.290 --> 00:14:07.040
a movie with them in the basement.

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:10.119
When he finds the dynamite, he lights it up
near the fireplace.

00:14:10.119 --> 00:14:13.209
Mr Miller quickly runs toward him and smacks
the explosive out of his hand.

00:14:13.209 --> 00:14:15.459
It rolls toward Kayleigh, and she picks it
up.

00:14:15.459 --> 00:14:19.300
The dynamite explodes in her hand, and Evan
ends up in a psych ward upon his return.

00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:23.379
Eager to try again, Evan goes to the doctor's
office to ask for his journals.

00:14:23.379 --> 00:14:25.839
The doctor tells him that the journals never
existed.

00:14:25.839 --> 00:14:29.189
He pointed out that Evan was just like his
father, who kept asking him for a photo album

00:14:29.189 --> 00:14:30.649
that he never had.

00:14:30.649 --> 00:14:33.929
When Andrea comes for a visit, he asks her
about the home movies he used to watch and

00:14:33.929 --> 00:14:36.249
tells her that he'd like to see them again.

00:14:36.249 --> 00:14:39.260
Once it went dark, Evan quickly snuck into
the doctor's office and started writing a

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:40.439
goodbye note.

00:14:40.439 --> 00:14:43.490
He watches a home movie of his pregnant mom
at the hospital before she gives birth to

00:14:43.490 --> 00:14:44.490
him.

00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:47.059
He goes back to that moment when he was still
in the womb.

00:14:47.059 --> 00:14:50.929
On her way to the delivery room, Andrea suddenly
feels a sharp pain in her womb.

00:14:50.929 --> 00:14:54.049
As the doctors observe the baby's condition
on the ultrasound, they find out that the

00:14:54.049 --> 00:14:56.049
umbilical cord is choking him.

00:14:56.049 --> 00:14:59.180
Andrea tells the doctor to save the baby,
but they eventually lose him.

00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:02.399
Evan’s friends lived very peaceful lives
in his absence.

00:15:02.399 --> 00:15:05.259
Kayleigh and Tommy went to live with their
mother and avoided getting abused by their

00:15:05.259 --> 00:15:06.259
father.

00:15:06.259 --> 00:15:08.429
Andrea had remarried and had another baby.

00:15:08.429 --> 00:15:16.410
Lenny had never suffered from any trauma.

00:15:16.410 --> 00:15:23.169
Tommy becomes a valedictorian of his class,
and Kayleigh gets married.
