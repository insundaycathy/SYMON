00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.280
Welcome to Thriller Recapped, Today, I&nbsp;
will show you an American Science fiction,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:11.760
psychological thriller film called The Butterfly&nbsp;
Effect: Chapter. 3, Spoilers Ahead, watch out and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.800
take care. This movie is the third and final&nbsp;
installment in the butterfly effect franchise.&nbsp;

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:25.280
The movie starts with the Protagonist Sam. We&nbsp;
see him in a park, sneaking on a woman and child,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:31.360
and then we see him witnessing the woman being&nbsp;
killed. He then wakes up in an ice-filled bathtub,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:38.080
his brain is being monitored by his sister, Jenna.&nbsp;
She asks what he saw but he avoids the question,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.080
and he leaves. He then goes to police station,&nbsp;
one of the officers speculate that he’s psychic.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.840
Sam, then identifies the man he saw&nbsp;
in his vision. They are amazed since&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.840
he has helped police in identifying 22&nbsp;
criminals in exchange of some money.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.000
Detective Dan Glenn asks him that if he’s psychic&nbsp;
then he should be able to tell how he met his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:07.120
wife. Sam smiles and leaves. Then we see Sam,&nbsp;
paying rent and all the bills of his sister,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:14.240
who is always isolated in her apartment. They talk&nbsp;
a bit, then Jenna asks him, that when she was 15&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:20.240
years old, there was a fire in the house, and she&nbsp;
was locked in the room. So, how did Sam, entered&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.840
the house from outside and rescued her, he says&nbsp;
he doesn’t want to talk about it, and he leaves.&nbsp;

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:32.560
Later that night, we see Elizabeth, the sister&nbsp;
of Sam’s murdered girlfriend Rebecca arrives at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:38.560
Sam’s apartment. She has a theory that the man who&nbsp;
is about to be executed for her sister’s murder,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:45.520
Lonnie Flennons, is innocent. She says, she&nbsp;
found a diary of her sister, in which she found&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.560
a confession that her sister was cheating on Sam&nbsp;
with Lonnie, and he can’t be the actual killer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.600
since they were seeing each other behind&nbsp;
his back. So, she wants Sam to find the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:01.040
actual murderer. He denies it by saying&nbsp;
it’s too complicated and she leaves.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:07.840
The next day, he meets, Goldberg, a man he&nbsp;
met in his previous time travel journeys.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.480
Goldberg tries to be T.V.A. And reminds him of&nbsp;
the strict rules: He is only supposed to observe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.920
the past events. He is not supposed to change&nbsp;
the past or it will change the future as well,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:27.040
by giving example. In Flashback, When Sam was 15,&nbsp;
a house fire would have killed Jenna, but same&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.400
couldn’t see his sister dying so he rescued her,&nbsp;
which resulted in the fire killing his parents.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:39.600
Which is consequence of Meddling with time,&nbsp;
he then leaves. We see Vicki, the bartender,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:45.520
she seduces Sam, and they both change&nbsp;
hormones for few seconds, until Sam remembers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:52.160
her dead girlfriend and he becomes soft.
Next day, He decides to help Elizabeth.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.640
He goes and meets Lonnie and tells him about&nbsp;
the diary that he knows they both had an affair,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.800
and which explains he is not the killer. Lonnie&nbsp;
then speculates that Sam killed Rebecca since&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:11.520
she was cheating on him. At home, Sam gets ready&nbsp;
to travel back in time when Rebecca was killed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:17.840
Jenna says he shouldn’t alter the past,&nbsp;
which he replies he made the rules.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.480
He then travels to 1998, he bumps into&nbsp;
the drunk Elizabeth, and he tells her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.040
to stay in car and lock the doors. Since&nbsp;
he knows Rebeca’s killer might be around.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.440
He goes upstairs, and finds Rebeca’s body&nbsp;
slaughtered in half, and in the car, someone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:41.280
attacks Elizabeth and kills her from behind too.&nbsp;
Sam returns to present, and he finds out that,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.240
he is renting his sofa to some dude called&nbsp;
Pako, and that he no longer owns a car.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.240
He goes to police station and learns that he is&nbsp;
the main suspect of the Rebecca’s murder case,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:58.080
since his prints were found near the house. They&nbsp;
tell him that there is a serial killer on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:02.560
loose, who has killed 8 women including&nbsp;
Rebecca and Elizabeth in last decade.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:09.840
Later, he calls his sister and finds out&nbsp;
that, Lonnie, who was a suspect in other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.640
reality is now a Lawyer, she tells him that&nbsp;
he needs to stop jumping between timelines.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.920
He meets Lonnie’s and asks him about his&nbsp;
whereabouts on the night of the murder.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:25.280
He said that night Rebecca asked him to meet&nbsp;
up since Sam wasn’t around but when he saw&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:31.200
Sam outside the he left instead. He then shows&nbsp;
him that he is handicapped in this timeline,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:37.280
so Sam leaves. However, like last time&nbsp;
Lonnie, again accuses Sam of the murders.

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:45.360
Next day, Sam visits Goldberg, and Goldberg says&nbsp;
he tried saving one life, but it resulted in death&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:51.200
of 8 women by a serial killer, and he shouldn’t&nbsp;
meddle with time. Then he says he shouldn’t go&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:56.160
back in the night of Rebecca’s murder which will&nbsp;
boil his brain, instead he should visit the scene&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:01.520
of third murder, but only observe this time, and&nbsp;
do not do anything but just see the face of killer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:06.480
and then report the killer to police, so when&nbsp;
he comes back in time the killer will be in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:12.880
prison. Sam tries sniffing a flower, and Goldberg&nbsp;
refuses by saying it will make him paralyzed for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:19.760
one hour. Later, Sam meets Jenna, and she refuses&nbsp;
to him by saying there are always consequences of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:27.600
his actions, so he leaves. He then gets ready to&nbsp;
travel back to see the third victim Anita Barnes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.800
He breaks into the house and hides&nbsp;
in a closet upon hearing some noise.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:35.680
Then we see Anita arriving, and she is&nbsp;
attacked by a man who tries to rape her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.200
but later we see, they were&nbsp;
trying to fantasize a rape fetish.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:45.200
She says she likes it, but her boyfriend is&nbsp;
uncomfortable, he then goes to closet to get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:52.160
some clothes and Sam is discovered, He gives Sam&nbsp;
a superman punch, and Sam returns to present.&nbsp;

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.600
We see Pako, asking Sam to&nbsp;
pay for the rent of couch.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:01.600
Later, He goes to Goldberg and finds&nbsp;
out that he is missing since many years.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:06.960
At this point, we can say that things have&nbsp;
changed drastically from meddling with time.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:12.880
He then decides to go and see Anita, the third&nbsp;
supposed victim, to know what she is doing after&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:18.320
the encounter. She says she has restraint order&nbsp;
against him, since he was hiding in her closet,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:25.120
and she pepper sprays him. He then goes to meet&nbsp;
his siter, she finds out that he time traveled&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:30.400
again without telling her, so she is mad,&nbsp;
he asks her how Anita Barnes is still alive,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:35.520
he said Goldberg could have explained what’s&nbsp;
going on, but he is missing. She says it’s good&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:41.600
that he is missing, she then claims that Goldberg&nbsp;
tried convicting Sam of all the murders, she then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:46.320
claims further that she erased the evidence so&nbsp;
that Sam can escape, and that future Sam is the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:53.360
serial killer. He is shocked and cannot accept&nbsp;
that he can kill anyone, he breaks down that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:58.640
only thing he wants to do is help people not hurt&nbsp;
anyone, and he promises not to time travel again.&nbsp;

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.600
He then goes to the bar and visits Vicki, the&nbsp;
bartender. He asks if she can come over for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:11.680
hormone sandwich, but she says she is engaged&nbsp;
now, he says maybe in another life, and decides&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:18.320
to leave. Once he leaves, we see someone dressed&nbsp;
like Texas chainsaw guy and cutting her in half.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:25.120
The next day, the Detectives find out that Vicki&nbsp;
is dead, and Sam was the last customer to leave.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:31.840
So, they arrest him for interrogation. Detective&nbsp;
Glenn accuses him of being the serial killer,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:36.320
when Jenna comes with a lawyer, Sam&nbsp;
steals the evidence notebook of Detective.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:41.520
He is bailed and they go to home, where&nbsp;
he gets ready to travel back in time.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:46.640
He goes to the place where they found bodies&nbsp;
of other victims to see the serial killer,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:50.800
he looks a bit and finds “Welcome&nbsp;
Home”, written on the wall,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:55.600
and he returns to the present.
He finds himself on Jenna’s couch&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:55.600 --> 00:08:00.880
and she leaves for work, and tells him that she&nbsp;
paid all the bills, and asks him if he can cook&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:06.000
dinner for them. In other timeline Sam used to&nbsp;
cover everything, their roles are reversed now.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:12.000
He then, tries to find a pattern for the murders,&nbsp;
and he goes to the place where they found bodies,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.320
as walks inside, looking for clues,&nbsp;
the team of detectives arrest him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:23.520
In police station, the detective tells him that&nbsp;
Sam is charged for killing 7 Women and 1 Man,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:29.840
he asks who was the man and finds out&nbsp;
Lonnie, is also murdered. In the lockup,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:34.880
he sees Detective Glenn, and tries to convince him&nbsp;
that the killer is still outside, he is not buying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:40.400
all this since evidence are against him. Then Sam&nbsp;
tells him that how detective met his wife his wife&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:45.040
mistook Glenn for M.C. Hammer on their first&nbsp;
meeting. Glenn comes back since only he and his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:49.920
wife knows about this, he says he travelled&nbsp;
back in time and saw it in other timeline&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:55.600
when Glenn asked him for the first time about it.&nbsp;
Glenn releases Sam by saying find that Son of the.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:03.440
Later, Sam goes to Jenna’s house and finds some&nbsp;
flowers by Goldberg. he sniffs them which turns&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:09.360
out to be the one that paralyzes you. He still&nbsp;
manages to go in tub and travel back in time,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:14.720
He goes to the same abandoned place,&nbsp;
and finds Goldberg brutally slaughtered.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:18.880
Running for help Sam falls to&nbsp;
the ground by a foothold trap.

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:26.800
The killer approaches him, and revealing herself,&nbsp;
it is Jenna. She says Surprise, and reveals she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:32.000
can travel in time as well just like her brother.&nbsp;
She loves for her brother like Alabama sweet home.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:37.120
Also, that she killed Rebecca,&nbsp;
since Rebecca was cheating on Sam.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:42.960
Further, she had to kill the other women because&nbsp;
she perceived them as rivals for Sam's affections&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:49.120
like Vicki, who was changing hormones with Sam in&nbsp;
one timeline. And other ones because they were new&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:55.120
witnesses, result of Sam's rescue attempts. She&nbsp;
tries to kiss Sam but he looks away and he travels&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:59.600
back to the day of the fire that killed his&nbsp;
parents; and this time instead of saving Jenna,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:05.600
he traps her in her burning room. Knowing&nbsp;
what the future holds. And saves his parents.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:11.280
He then wakes up in a timeline in which he has&nbsp;
married Elizabeth. They have a daughter called&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:18.160
Jenna; they go to their house. Where he is greeted&nbsp;
by his parents, Rebecca, and a healthy Goldberg.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:22.240
Sam's daughter Jenna puts her fashion&nbsp;
doll on the grill and smiles as it burns.&nbsp;

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:27.760
