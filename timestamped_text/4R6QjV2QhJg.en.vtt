00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.240
Welcome back to Movie Recaps. Today&nbsp;
I will show you a drama, horror,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:09.200
mystery film from 2020, titled The Rental.
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.560
An amazing view of a coastline can be seen,&nbsp;
then a house overseeing the water. Mina and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:18.480
Charlie are looking at the listing for that house&nbsp;
and see that it's available for that weekend.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.480
Even though it's super expensive, they&nbsp;
think they deserve to have a vacation there.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.360
Josh pops into the office and kisses Mina. Charlie&nbsp;
jokes with him a little, then they tell him about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:32.080
the celebration vacation they are planning.&nbsp;
When Mina leaves, Josh congratulates Charlie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:37.280
over the big deal happening at his job. The two&nbsp;
of them leave. That night, Charlie is in bed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.440
while his wife Michelle tells him that she's&nbsp;
happy that his brother Josh is doing better.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.400
She thinks Mina is a positive influence on him,&nbsp;
but Charlie thinks that she's too good for him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.000
Meanwhile, the two of them are&nbsp;
in bed joking around and kissing.&nbsp;

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.160
That weekend, Charlie and Michelle pick them&nbsp;
up from their house to go to the rental.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.880
Josh brings his dog Reggie to Charlie's&nbsp;
displeasure, but he still pets him. Later, they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:03.520
talk about the fact that the owner of the rental&nbsp;
denied Mina's request and accepted Charlie's.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.440
Josh thinks the owner is a racist, but his&nbsp;
brother wants to give him the benefit of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.920
doubt for some reason. Mina keeps out of the&nbsp;
conversation. They drive to the coastline and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.720
when they get close to the house, Charlie tells&nbsp;
Josh to hide Reggie so the owner doesn't see him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.360
They arrive and get out of the car. When the owner&nbsp;
doesn't show up immediately, they let themselves&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.320
in. Charlie calls him and they realize that he's&nbsp;
right behind them. He's a bit mad that he waited&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.200
for them for an hour. Mina is surprised that he&nbsp;
owns a house like that, so he tells them that it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.840
his brother's house and he just takes care of it.&nbsp;
Charlie introduces everyone to the owner and when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.800
he gets to Mina, the man asks her how she got in&nbsp;
their family. She's pissed because she thinks he's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.280
a racist and can't believe they'll be giving him&nbsp;
so much money to stay in the house, but Josh calms&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.320
her down. They walk inside as the owner is giving&nbsp;
Charlie and Michelle a tour of the place. He shows&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.880
them the balcony and the hot tub, then tells them&nbsp;
how beautiful the stars look from there at night.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.640
Michelle comments that she should've brought her&nbsp;
telescope and he tells her that he'll bring one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.880
for them. Before he leaves he tells them where to&nbsp;
find the rest of the information they might need&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.040
and that he's just up the road if they need&nbsp;
him. Mina confronts him about her application,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.600
but he doesn't really respond to her. Charlie&nbsp;
and Michelle are putting away the groceries,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:17.200
when the man drives by and spies on them. He&nbsp;
drives away fast, scaring the two. Josh notices&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.600
that Mina's still angry about what happened and&nbsp;
starts joking with his brother to calm her down.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.760
Later, Michelle is getting unpacked, when&nbsp;
she finds some dirt on the bed covers.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.480
Charlie checks the password for the wifi. And Mina&nbsp;
goes through the bathroom cabinet. She finds a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.760
photo of the man in the drawer and flips it over.&nbsp;
Josh is outside playing with Reggie. He throws the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.160
dog's ball underneath the crawlspace and goes&nbsp;
over to fetch it. The door is open so he goes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.880
inside and finds it, but sees another door under&nbsp;
there. He's checking it out, when Mina jumps and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.680
scares him. They think it's creepy that there's a&nbsp;
hidden door with an electronic lock and password.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:55.280
Out of jest, Josh tries to enter 666 in&nbsp;
and open the door. They laugh and leave.&nbsp;

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.920
The four of them are taking a walk on the beach.&nbsp;
Mina and Charlie are upfront with Josh and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.400
Michelle following. Josh looks at them having fun&nbsp;
and tells Michelle that he's afraid that she will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.720
leave him. She tells him that she only sees his&nbsp;
brother as a work partner and that he shouldn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.680
be worried. He thinks that she doesn't need him&nbsp;
to feel inspired. Michelle reassures him that what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.640
she needs from him is love and support. Suddenly,&nbsp;
Mina joins them and asks them to turn back.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:24.240
The two couples walk to the house at sunset. When&nbsp;
they walk in the house they find the telescope.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:28.880
Everyone is excited for that, except for Mina.&nbsp;
She doesn't like the fact that he can just come&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.840
inside whenever he wants. No one else wants to&nbsp;
talk about it. Later, they're finishing with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.000
dinner and Michelle is showing them pictures&nbsp;
of the waterfall they'll go see tomorrow.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.320
Mina asks Michelle if she has the surprise they&nbsp;
were planning together and she brings a little&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.640
baggie over to the table. Charlie can't believe&nbsp;
that Michelle got them molly for the weekend.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.120
Everyone wants to get high that night, part from&nbsp;
Michelle. She's had a long week at work and she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.680
wants to rest. She tells them to leave some of&nbsp;
the drug so they can all do it again tomorrow.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.160
The three of them and Reggie dance to super&nbsp;
loud music, then the two brothers play fight.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.880
Michelle is sleeping, but there seems to be&nbsp;
something sinister going on. The rest are on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:09.120
the balcony looking at the stairs and talking.&nbsp;
Charlie makes fun of Josh and he goes inside to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:14.080
get another drink. Mina stands up to stargaze,&nbsp;
but turns the telescope toward the houses.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.800
Suddenly, she tells Charlie that someone is&nbsp;
looking right back at her and crouches down.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:23.760
As soon as he peeps through the telescope,&nbsp;
she laughs and tells him she was joking. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:28.480
continues the same joke and scares her a little.&nbsp;
They continue to talk and have a moment, when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:33.360
Mina starts feeling a little bit uncomfortable and&nbsp;
walks inside the house to check on Josh. She finds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:38.000
him passed out drunk on the couch. When she goes&nbsp;
back outside Charlie is uncovering the hot tub.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:43.600
Mina tells him about Josh, but they still decide&nbsp;
to get in the tub. Charlie walks inside to get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:48.320
his suit. Michelle is sound asleep. He waits&nbsp;
for Mina in the hot tub and she brings him a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:53.840
drink as she comes inside. They trade places so&nbsp;
Mina can sit next to the water jets in the tub.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:58.240
All of a sudden he tells her that she's brilliant&nbsp;
and great. She says that she feels the same&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:03.280
way about him, happy that they have a great&nbsp;
partnership. They cheer and he sits next to her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:08.080
He starts kissing her, but Reggie barks and&nbsp;
cries and interrupts them. Mina changes her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:13.040
mind and gets out of the tub. Someone is watching&nbsp;
them from the distance. Mina walks inside the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:17.600
house and goes to take a shower, freaking out&nbsp;
about what happened. She's showering and hears&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:22.080
the door. Charlie appears in the bathroom&nbsp;
and gets in the shower with her. They kiss.&nbsp;

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.680
Charlie wakes up alone in bed the next day. He&nbsp;
joins the others in the dinning room and Michelle&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:32.880
greets him. She tells him to hurry so they can go&nbsp;
on their hike. Josh tells Mina that it's time to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:37.760
go, but she says that she won't go. He tells her&nbsp;
that she's the one that wanted to have a vacation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:42.320
so they could spend more time together. She still&nbsp;
doesn't want to go on the hike and he suggests the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:47.280
two of them stay back. Mina doesn't want to spoil&nbsp;
the hike for Michelle so she tells him to go,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:52.160
because it's apparent that Charlie doesn't want to&nbsp;
go on it either. Charlie apologizes to Michelle.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:56.560
She doesn't like the fact that he's not coming,&nbsp;
but her and Josh still go on the hike. Before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:01.280
they leave Josh tells Mina that Reggie is tied&nbsp;
up out back and that she should check up on him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:05.280
She's left alone in the house with Charlie and&nbsp;
they awkwardly start to talk about what happened&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:09.200
between the two of them the previous night.&nbsp;
Mina thinks that they shouldn't continue the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:14.000
affair and he agrees. She tells him that&nbsp;
she really loves his brother. Meanwhile,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.920
Josh and Michelle are on the hike and he's&nbsp;
telling her the story of how the two of them met.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:22.560
He says that her and Charlie have the best&nbsp;
story. Michelle tells him that it's complicated,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:26.880
considering that Charlie had a girlfriend at the&nbsp;
time. Josh jokes that the same thing happened&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:32.080
before, but Michelle doesn't appreciate the joke.&nbsp;
She didn't know that and she feels terrible. They&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:36.080
stop for a moment and he tries to comfort her.&nbsp;
Someone is spying on them while they're there.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:42.000
Back at the house, Mina is tiding up the place,&nbsp;
covering the hot tub and taking the telescope in.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000
Charlie is sleeping in the living room. She&nbsp;
sarcastically tells him to keep sleeping and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.880
that she'll finish cleaning up, so he lies back&nbsp;
down on the couch. Mina goes to take a shower&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:55.440
and when she's done with it, she sees something&nbsp;
in the shower head. She calls for Charlie and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:55.440 --> 00:07:00.000
shows him that there is a camera in it, telling&nbsp;
him that she will call the cops. He freaks out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.240
and runs over to check the other shower where they&nbsp;
made love, only to find another camera there too.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:09.200
They both freak out and he says that they can't&nbsp;
call the cops because Michelle and Josh will find&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:13.440
out about everything. Mina doesn't want the man&nbsp;
to get away with it. He thinks that they should&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:17.680
pretend that it never happened and she says that&nbsp;
they should threaten him to give them the footage.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:22.400
Charlie's of the opinion that if they do that, he&nbsp;
will surely show Michelle and Josh the footage.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:26.400
Mina is angry, but says that they should make&nbsp;
up some kind of lie so they can leave early.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:30.560
Charlie disagrees and convinces her to&nbsp;
pretend that the whole thing never happened.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:35.920
Josh and Michelle come back from the hike.&nbsp;
She's angry at Charlie and walks right past him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:40.960
Josh kisses Mina and tells her that he wants to&nbsp;
take a shower, but she finds a way to convince&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:46.320
him not to take one. Charlie goes after Michelle&nbsp;
and asks her what's wrong. She asks him about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:50.480
his previous girlfriends and he tells her the&nbsp;
truth, but doesn't understand why she's asking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:56.160
him that. They argue, but don't really settle the&nbsp;
argument. Later, Michelle walks in on the three&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.160 --> 00:08:01.280
of them watching a documentary about sea turtles&nbsp;
and she's disappointed. She turns off the TV and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:05.840
tells them that they won't end their vacation&nbsp;
like that. She wants to do drugs and party. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:09.840
rest don't feel like it and they tell her that&nbsp;
they're not going to participate. Charlie asks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:14.400
her if she wouldn't want a slower night playing&nbsp;
board games. She's mad at them, but still decides&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:18.880
to go through with her plan and get high. Michelle&nbsp;
does some molly and leaves Charlie in the kitchen.&nbsp;

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:24.640
Later that day, Josh is making dinner and calls&nbsp;
for Reggie. When the dog doesn't show up, he asks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:30.000
Mina and Charlie where he is. He storms outside,&nbsp;
with Mina following him, saying that she's sorry&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.560
because she forgot about the dog. They pass by&nbsp;
Michelle and don't tell her what has happened.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:39.440
Josh finds Reggie's leash, but there is no sign&nbsp;
of the dog even when they all call after him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:43.840
He's upset and they all go searching for&nbsp;
Reggie. Michelle figures out what happened,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:48.400
but continues to get the hot tub ready. The three&nbsp;
of them look for him in the surrounding area.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:52.880
Meanwhile, Michelle is having fun by herself&nbsp;
when they come back to get their phones.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:57.600
She tells Charlie that she called the man&nbsp;
to fix the hot tub because it's not working.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:02.400
He gets upset that the man will be coming to the&nbsp;
house. Michelle doesn't understand the problem and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:07.760
he tells her that Mina doesn't like him. She says&nbsp;
it's fine so that Michelle doesn't get suspicious.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:12.560
Josh comes inside wondering if the man took Reggie&nbsp;
and saying that he will confront him about it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:17.840
Charlie doesn't like that idea, but he will still&nbsp;
go ahead with it. A bit later, the man arrives and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:22.000
Josh confronts him instantly. He tells him that&nbsp;
he'd been drinking all day and that he hasn't been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.200
to the house. Josh asks him bluntly if he took&nbsp;
Reggie, but the man tries to figure out why they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:31.840
have a dog there in the first place. Josh asks&nbsp;
him again and he says that he didn't take him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:37.440
Michelle interrupts the conversation and sends&nbsp;
the man to fix the hot tub. Charlie joins her out,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:42.080
so she's not out there alone with him. The man is&nbsp;
repairing the tub and Michelle makes fun of him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:47.120
He fixes it in no time and tells them to enjoy&nbsp;
their final night before they leave. Charlie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:51.760
stays with Michelle at the hot tub. The man is&nbsp;
walking out to his car when he happens upon Mina&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:56.320
searching for Reggie. He tells her that he's a&nbsp;
dog lover himself and that he hopes they find him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:01.280
Mina asks him back inside to show him the camera&nbsp;
in the shower, but he thinks that it's about the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:05.360
toilet. She tells him that if he releases the&nbsp;
footage from the shower they will go right to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:09.760
the cops, but he doesn't understand what she's&nbsp;
talking about. Mina lights up the shower head&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:13.760
and shows him the camera, but he doesn't know what&nbsp;
it is and thinks that they are the ones actually&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:17.920
pulling a scam on him. He tells her to call the&nbsp;
police because he had nothing to do with the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:22.240
camera and takes his phone out to call them. She&nbsp;
struggles with him for the phone and Josh sees it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:27.120
happening from outside. He runs into the bathroom&nbsp;
and tackles the man, beating him senseless.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:32.080
Mina can't pull him away. Michelle and Charlie&nbsp;
hear that something is going on inside and run in.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:36.640
Charlie pulls Josh away from the man before&nbsp;
he kills him. Josh runs out and all of them go&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:41.760
after him. Michelle asks what happened as Mina and&nbsp;
Charlie argue. Mina tells her that he was filming&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:46.160
them and that even though they kept it secret from&nbsp;
the two of them, she needed to confront him. Josh&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:51.600
heard them fighting and misunderstood, so he came&nbsp;
in and started plummeting the guy. Simultaneously,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:56.320
someone is watching them on a security camera. The&nbsp;
same person goes into the bathroom and kills the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:56.320 --> 00:11:01.120
man. The four of them are arguing about what they&nbsp;
should do. Michelle seems to be the only one who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:05.440
thinks that they should call an ambulance and the&nbsp;
police. Josh is trying to convince them that he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:10.240
didn't do anything wrong. Charlie goes to check&nbsp;
on Taylor and Michelle goes to find her phone.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:14.640
He comes in and tells her to wait because the&nbsp;
man isn't breathing. Josh freaks out and doesn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:19.120
understand how he can die from the beating. Mina&nbsp;
asks what they should do and Michelle thinks they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:23.040
should call the police. Charlie doesn't think&nbsp;
that's their best option, since his brother&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:27.520
had already been to prison once. He thinks they&nbsp;
should stage the scene to look like an accident,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:31.840
as if he got drunk and fell of a cliff after he&nbsp;
cleaned out the place. Michelle doesn't want to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:37.040
hear it. But they continue to plan it out and see&nbsp;
what could be done. Mina already seems on board,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:40.960
trying to figure out how they would find the&nbsp;
footage. She thinks the receiver to the wifi&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:44.960
camera must be somewhere in the house. Michelle&nbsp;
doesn't want to have anything to do with it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:49.840
so she storms out of the room, realizing the three&nbsp;
of them have already agreed. They move the body&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:54.720
and clean up the place. Mina packs her things and&nbsp;
Charlie puts the man's tools back in his truck.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:59.440
Before they leave to dispose of the body , Charlie&nbsp;
goes to see Michelle. He tells her that she didn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:03.760
do anything and she shouldn't feel guilty. She&nbsp;
says that by not calling the police she becomes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:08.160
an accomplice to murder like him and Mina. The&nbsp;
three of them get the man's body down the stairs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:12.560
and carry him out to the cliff. They throw him&nbsp;
over, but he falls on a rock and doesn't drop in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:17.920
the water. Charlie finds a rock and decides to try&nbsp;
to push him over with it. He fails. Him and Josh&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:22.720
find a bigger rock and just end up smashing his&nbsp;
head. Josh decides to climb down to the man and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:27.600
push him over. Mina and Charlie don't think that&nbsp;
he should do it because it's too dangerous, but he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:32.800
proceeds regardless. When he comes close to the&nbsp;
body, he slips and falls on top of it. He tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:37.520
the others that he's ok and pushes the body off of&nbsp;
the cliff. Josh gets back up and they head back to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:42.800
the house. Simultaneously, Michelle hears a shower&nbsp;
come on inside the house and goes to check on it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:47.360
She checks each shower one by one, though none&nbsp;
of them is on. She keeps hearing the sound and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:51.840
follows it around the house. Michelle finally&nbsp;
finds the place where the sound is coming from.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:56.880
There's a recording playing on a TV showing Mina&nbsp;
and Charlie making love in the shower. As Charlie,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:01.440
Josh and Mina are coming back to the house, a&nbsp;
man appears behind them, but they don't see him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:06.240
Suddenly, Michelle drives off and Charlie stops&nbsp;
her. She tells him that she saw the footage.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:10.400
He asks where she found the footage instead&nbsp;
of apologizing and she drives away from him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:14.320
Charlie comes back to the group and tells them&nbsp;
that they need to find the footage first and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:18.960
think about how they'll leave the place second.&nbsp;
As Michelle is driving, her tire pops and she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:24.240
hits into a tree. She finds what caused her tire&nbsp;
to pop, freaks out and goes back to the car,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:29.360
locking herself in and texting Charlie. Suddenly,&nbsp;
a man shows up and breaks her car window.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:33.680
Meanwhile, the others are searching the house for&nbsp;
the footage. Charlie gets Michelle's message and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:38.320
goes after her. He finds the car without her&nbsp;
inside and calls her phone. The ringtone is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:42.560
heard from behind some bushes and when he goes&nbsp;
toward it, he stumbles upon Michelle's body.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:47.440
All of a sudden, the man knocks him out and kills&nbsp;
him. In the meantime, Mina and Josh go under the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:52.000
crawlspace and open the hidden door. Even though&nbsp;
the place looked suspicious from the outside,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.320
they don't find anything inside the room. When&nbsp;
they realize they won't find anything there they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:56.320 --> 00:14:00.960
decide to go back to the house. Josh lags behind&nbsp;
and gets an audio message with Charlie's and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:05.600
Mina's conversation about their secret. When he&nbsp;
gets to her inside the house he asks her about it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:10.240
but gets a message with the video as well. When&nbsp;
he sees it, he freaks out and wants to go after&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:16.000
Charlie. The doors slam downstairs and he thinks&nbsp;
it's him, so he follows. Mina stays behind and he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.240
looks for him around the house. Josh opens&nbsp;
a door and the man hits him over the head.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:25.120
Mina hears the commotion and climbs down, but when&nbsp;
she sees the man she runs away from him. Before he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:30.000
goes after her, he kills Josh. Mina sends him&nbsp;
in a false direction and escapes the house.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.080
The man finds her quickly and runs after her&nbsp;
through the woods. She doesn't know where she's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:38.560
going through the heavy fog and eventually falls&nbsp;
over the cliff. The man makes sure she's dead,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:43.520
then goes back to the house and starts cleaning up&nbsp;
after himself. He takes the wires from the road,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:48.320
he places the hammer back in the toolbox and he&nbsp;
takes out every camera and every listening device&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:52.800
he has set up in the house. He looks at himself&nbsp;
in the mirror and takes off his mask. He's still&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:57.600
in the house when Reggie finally comes back.&nbsp;
He tries to pet him, but the dog backs away.&nbsp;

00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:01.760
Later, the man is seen looking over a rental&nbsp;
apartment. The woman is showing him around&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:05.280
the place and gives him the keys before&nbsp;
she leaves. He makes another set of them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:09.600
and prepares the apartment in the same way as&nbsp;
he did the house, placing cameras everywhere.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:13.280
The man sits on the sofa with his mask&nbsp;
on, thinking about his next victims.
