00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.520
Welcome back to Movie Recaps.&nbsp;
Today Iâ€™m gonna explain a mystery,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:08.960
horror, thriller film from 2016, titled The&nbsp;
Boy. Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.&nbsp;

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.760
A car drives through a road in the British&nbsp;
countryside. On its back seat, there's an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.400
American woman sleeping, Greta Evans. She's woken&nbsp;
up by the driver when they finally make it to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.960
house she'll be working at. The driver informs&nbsp;
her the house owners had to step out for a second&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.520
and that she should wait for them in the parlor.
Greta enters the house and takes off her shoes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.520
leaving them next to her things by the&nbsp;
entrance. When she hears a noise from upstairs,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.160
she decides to go there. She finds a painting on&nbsp;
the way: a picture of a couple with their son,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:41.040
presumably the family she'll work for. She goes&nbsp;
farther inside and finds a child's room, which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.440
she enters and grabs a toy for a closer look. The&nbsp;
toy is dropped to the ground when she's startled&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:51.760
by a man, Malcolm, saying hi from behind. He's the&nbsp;
grocery boy. After he introduces himself, he asks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.720
her to join him in the kitchen so he can show her&nbsp;
around, which she accepts. Once there, they start&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.560
putting the groceries away while chatting.&nbsp;
Malcolm guesses she's American and the she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:05.360
is running away from someone. Eager to change the&nbsp;
subject, Greta asks him what the family is like.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.960
Malcolm tells her they're very nice and generous.&nbsp;
When she asks about the son, however, he hesitates&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.800
and says he doesn't know how to explain.
They're suddenly interrupted by a woman,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.520
Mrs. Heelshire, entering the room and asking why&nbsp;
Greta isn't wearing any shoes. They go back to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.920
the house entrance to retrieve them, but the shoes&nbsp;
aren't there where she left them. Mrs. Heelshire&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.160
tells her they'll show up, it was just her son&nbsp;
playing around. Greta outs on different shoes.&nbsp;

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.880
In another room, Mr. Heelshire is talking&nbsp;
to his son, Brahms, whose face is hidden&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.240
by the chair. The two women arrive then, and Mrs.&nbsp;
Heelshire introduces Greta to her husband and son,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.960
but when they step aside, the figure sitting on&nbsp;
the chair turns out to be a doll. Greta laughs,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.640
thinking they're pranking her, but their&nbsp;
serious faces tell her that's not the case.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.560
They're interrupted by Malcolm, who enters the&nbsp;
room and interacts with the doll as if it was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.680
a real person. Malcolm leaves then and Greta,&nbsp;
encouraged by his reaction, approaches the doll,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.920
shakes his hand and tells him she hopes they&nbsp;
can be friends. Mrs. Heelshire asks the dad&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.520
to bring Greta's things up to her room while&nbsp;
she shows the new nanny all she needs to know.&nbsp;

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.000
While making their way upstairs, Mrs. Heelshire&nbsp;
tells Greta they've tried other nannies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.920
and Brahms rejected them all, although they&nbsp;
hadn't been as young and pretty as Greta.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.080
Once they reach Brahms' room, Mrs. Heelshire&nbsp;
guides Greta through the daily routine.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.880
Brahms must be woken up every morning at 7 am and&nbsp;
changed into clean clothes, which Mrs. Heelshire&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.760
asks Greta to demonstrate. She disapproves of the&nbsp;
way Greta does it, so she ends up stepping in and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.720
doing it herself. They go to the studio next.&nbsp;
Brahms has three hours of lessons five days a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.600
week and likes to start with poetry. Next is music&nbsp;
appreciation, which is very important to Brahm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.240
and it must be played rather loudly. A couple of&nbsp;
hours later, they're all having dinner together,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.080
doll included. When they're done, Greta&nbsp;
takes the leftovers to the kitchen,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.160
but Mrs. Heelshire tells her they don't throw&nbsp;
away food because they're in the countryside.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.080
They must save it in the freezer for&nbsp;
emergencies. Mr. Heelshire walks in then,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.040
hands Brahms to his wife and takes&nbsp;
Greta with him to check on the traps.&nbsp;

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.600
Greta follows him outside and finds him getting&nbsp;
caught rats from the traps in the garden.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.360
While doing all the checking, Mr. Heelshire&nbsp;
tells her more about the house, like the fact&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.600
all windows have been shut permanently. Mr.&nbsp;
Heelshire says he isn't sure how they reached&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.440
this point but he tells Greta that no matter how&nbsp;
it looks from the outside, their son is there with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.160
them. Greta tells him she understands.
In the evening, the parents put Brahms&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.320
to bed and they pray all together while Greta&nbsp;
listens - they include her name in the prayer.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.760
Mrs. Heelshire asks Greta for a&nbsp;
moment of privacy with her family.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.680
Greta waits outside while they chat, but the&nbsp;
couple is quick to come out a moment later to tell&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.320
Greta Brahms wants her as his nanny if she'll have&nbsp;
him. Greta agrees and Mrs. Heelshire hugs her.&nbsp;

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.920
Greta goes to her room to call her&nbsp;
sister Sandy on the landline phone.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.440
She tells her how weird everything is, including&nbsp;
the lack of wi-fi and phone signal. Sandy tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.600
her she needed to get away and this job fits her&nbsp;
situation perfectly then confesses that Greta's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.400
ex, Cole, has been calling her house nonstop,&nbsp;
even appeared by the house and scared her kid.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.320
But she hasn't told him anything about Greta's&nbsp;
current location and promises she never will,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:58.560
not wanting to see her sister hurt again.
The next morning, Greta leaves her room when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.400
she hears some noises and finds Mrs. Heelshire&nbsp;
scolding Brahms for throwing his toys on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.520
floor. Mr. Heelshire startles Greta out of&nbsp;
her watching, apologizing for the sudden rush.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:11.760
He tells her it's been such a long time since&nbsp;
they went on a holiday, they're anxious to go.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.960
He also gives Greta a sheet of paper&nbsp;
with the rules she must follow every day.&nbsp;

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.400
We follow Mr. Heelshire and Greta walk towards&nbsp;
the house entrance. As Mrs. Heelshire joins them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.240
with Brahms in her arms, the husband tells Greta&nbsp;
to be good to his boy because then he'll be good&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.800
for her in return. If she's bad to him though,&nbsp;
well - he doesn't get to finish that sentence,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.960
because his wife interrupts him. Greta promises&nbsp;
she'll treat the boy as if he was his own,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.520
and after being handed the doll, Mrs.&nbsp;
Heelshire hugs her and apologizes in her ear.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.120
Greta takes Brahms outside and together&nbsp;
they watch the couple leave in the car.&nbsp;

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.600
Once back inside, Greta doesn't follow the rules.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.160
She leaves Brahms on a random chair and covers him&nbsp;
with a blanket because he creeps her out before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.840
heading to the kitchen to make a PB and jelly&nbsp;
sandwich that she takes with her to a reading&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.400
chair, where she drinks some wine and eats while&nbsp;
reading a magazine. Eventually she falls asleep.&nbsp;

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.360
It's nighttime when she wakes up. She grabs&nbsp;
the tray and intends to take it to the kitchen,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:06.320
but stops midway when she notices the blanket has&nbsp;
fallen off Brahms. Creeped out by this, she grabs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.160
him and takes him to his room, carelessly throwing&nbsp;
him on a rocking chair before going to bed.&nbsp;

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:14.800
Greta is woken up by the sound of a kid's&nbsp;
laughter echoing in the house. She leaves&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.960
the room to investigate, and when she reaches the&nbsp;
painting of the family, she comes closer to look&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.880
at the kid and is suddenly grabbed by the neck&nbsp;
by a hand coming out of it - that's the exact&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:28.160
moment she wakes up in bed, perfectly fine. Upset&nbsp;
by this dream, she dresses up and goes to Brahms'&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:32.480
room to check on him - he's on the chair where she&nbsp;
left him, and there's water falling from his eye.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:36.480
Greta comes closer, nervous at the idea it&nbsp;
may be tears, but she quickly discovers it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:40.800
just water from a ceiling leak. To protect the&nbsp;
doll, she moves him to the bed before leaving.&nbsp;

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.440
In another part of the house, she finds a door&nbsp;
to an attic and tries to open it using a fire&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:50.880
poker to no avail. Later that day, we see Greta&nbsp;
trying to keep herself busy. She tries to call her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:55.280
sister but she gets the answering machine. The&nbsp;
phone rings as soon as she hangs up, and Greta&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:00.320
quickly picks it up, but only hears static noise.
The next day, Greta's at the gates picking up the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:04.720
mail when Malcolm arrives in his car with the&nbsp;
groceries. They go to the kitchen, where Malcolm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:09.120
shows her they must throw all the leftover food in&nbsp;
a trash bag he'll take with him. Greta complains&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:13.280
about Malcolm not warning her about Brahms, and&nbsp;
he says he didn't want to ruin the surprise.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:17.760
Greta asks him about the story behind the doll.
Malcolm takes her to a grave near the house.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:22.240
Turns out Brahms didn't survive a house fire&nbsp;
on his eighth birthday, the doll showed up the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:26.800
day after. Malcolm says he knows it all&nbsp;
seems very strange, but it's harmless.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:30.240
Greta makes the math and realizes the couple&nbsp;
has been living like this for twenty years.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:34.400
Malcolm tells her they had been looking for a&nbsp;
nanny for one year before Greta came along and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:38.560
if she's feeling restless, he can take her out&nbsp;
and show her the nightlife in town, promising he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:42.720
won't tell anyone. Greta accepts after making&nbsp;
sure Malcolm understands it's not a date,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:47.840
because she recently got out of a relationship.
In Brahms' room, we learn all the conversations&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:52.160
in the house reach Brahms through the walls.&nbsp;
Greta is in her own room on the phone with Sandy,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:55.600
telling her about her plans for the night,&nbsp;
but isn't able to convince her sister that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:55.600 --> 00:07:01.040
this isn't a date. Sandy approves, Greta needs to&nbsp;
get out more. When glancing at the mirror, Greta&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:05.840
notices Brahms looking at her from the other room.&nbsp;
Feeling creeped out again, she closes the door.&nbsp;

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:10.880
Moments later, she goes to the bathroom to take&nbsp;
a shower, unaware of another presence in the room&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:14.880
that takes her dress and necklace. When she&nbsp;
comes out and looks at herself in the mirror,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:19.520
she notices she's missing a chunk of hair, and&nbsp;
right after she notices the missing objects too.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:23.600
Upon returning to her bedroom, she finds all&nbsp;
drawers open and all her clothes missing as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:28.240
Scared, she leaves the bedroom, only to find the&nbsp;
door to the attic open and the stairs ready to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:32.800
climb inside. Starting to think it may be an&nbsp;
intruder, she grabs the fire poker and enters&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:37.440
the attic. As soon as she's inside, the door&nbsp;
closes behind her, and she can't open it again.&nbsp;

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:41.600
When she hears a car, she goes to the&nbsp;
window to see Malcolm knocking on the door.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:45.600
She tries to make noise to call his&nbsp;
attention, but he can't hear her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:50.000
Next she tries breaking the window with the poker,&nbsp;
but she only manages to break the poker itself,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.040
and Malcolm leaves. While trying&nbsp;
to find a way around the place,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:57.120
a human shadow startles her and she falls to&nbsp;
the floor, the hit to the head knocking her out.&nbsp;

00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:01.760
She wakes up the next morning still in the&nbsp;
attic. She learns he shadow she saw last&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:05.680
night was just some clothes on a hanger and&nbsp;
finds a photo album from Brahms' childhood.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:09.360
Among all the pictures, there's one of the&nbsp;
painting and the photo that it was based on,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:13.440
although on the original, Brahms' look much more&nbsp;
serious. Greta's startled out of her thoughts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:18.080
by the attic door suddenly opening on its own.&nbsp;
Greta leaves and goes to her room, only to find&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:22.640
her clothes back hanging all over the furniture.
Malcolm comes by a few hours later to help her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:27.200
check the house for intruders, but he doesn't&nbsp;
find any signs of breaking in. Greta points out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:31.680
that doesn't explain her clothes. To help her&nbsp;
feel at peace, Malcolm decides to stick around.&nbsp;

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:36.640
While playing some pool, Greta asks Malcolm&nbsp;
to tell him more about the real Brahms.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:41.440
He says he knows nothing else, but he's clearly&nbsp;
lying, so Greta insists. Malcolm tells her there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:46.000
are two kinds of stories around town and the&nbsp;
truth is somewhere in between. The polite talk&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:51.280
says Brahms was a good kid, the pub talk says he&nbsp;
was very strange. When Greta asks for the truth,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:54.640
Malcolm tells him about the day he came to&nbsp;
the house with a delivery for what would've&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:59.520
been Brahms' birthday. Mrs. Heelshire was opening&nbsp;
presents with the doll while Mr. Heelshire was in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:04.080
the pool room, drinking and mumbling he couldn't&nbsp;
do it anymore. He invited Malcolm to drink with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:08.720
him and Malcolm asked him about the real Brahms&nbsp;
too. The father replied, with a heartbroken look,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:13.600
that the kid was odd. After checking Greta&nbsp;
truly is ok on her own, Malcolm leaves.&nbsp;

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:18.000
Greta moves to her room to talk to her sister&nbsp;
on the phone. Sandy informs Greta that Cole has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.640
been by her house again. Sandy's kid, trying&nbsp;
to get rid of him, gave Cole Greta's address.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:28.160
Sandy apologizes but Greta doesn't blame her for&nbsp;
it. After hanging up, Greta goes to the bathroom&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:32.720
to brush her teeth and notices a moving shadow&nbsp;
in the mirror. She goes to Brahms' bedroom, where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:36.960
she finds a bunch of paper sheets on the floor.&nbsp;
She fixes the position of the doll's face but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:40.960
it moves on its own to look at her, and at that&nbsp;
moment, once again, Greta wakes up in her bed.&nbsp;

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:45.760
She hears some noises outside so she goes to&nbsp;
her door and opens it, only to find her lost&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:50.400
shoes waiting for her. Getting scared, she goes&nbsp;
to Brahms' room to find him in a new position:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:55.040
sitting on the edge of the bed, the list of rules&nbsp;
next to him. Greta runs back to her room and locks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:59.680
the door, then tries to make a call but the phone&nbsp;
isn't working. She hangs up, and the phone rings&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:04.320
right afterward. When she picks it up, a child's&nbsp;
voice says her name and asks her to come out,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:08.880
it also wonders why she isn't following the rules.&nbsp;
Greta drops the phone, but then there's knocking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:12.640
on the door and something is left in front&nbsp;
of it - "her favorite" the voice says. Greta&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:16.880
opens the door to find a tray with a PB and jelly&nbsp;
sandwich, and Brahms still sitting on his bed with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:21.280
the rules. Greta approaches the doll and finally&nbsp;
understands Brahms only wants her to follow the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:26.320
rules. Malcolm calls and tries to invite her out,&nbsp;
but Greta hangs up, all her attention on the doll.&nbsp;

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:30.480
Somewhere else far away, the Heelshires&nbsp;
are writing a goodbye letter to Brahm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:33.120
before filling their pockets with&nbsp;
rocks and walking into the ocean.&nbsp;

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:38.160
Next day, Greta starts following the rules&nbsp;
to a tee, except for the good night kiss.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:41.600
Many days later, Malcolm visits her&nbsp;
since she wouldn't pick up the phone,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:46.240
he also brings in the mail, which she&nbsp;
ignores. After she promises she's doing fine,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:51.120
he tries to ask her out again, she turns him&nbsp;
down so he leaves. Alone with the doll, Greta&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:55.840
tries to make him grab a fruit, asking for a sign&nbsp;
of a presence of a spirit in the house. At first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:55.840 --> 00:11:00.480
there's no answer, but when Greta leaves the room,&nbsp;
she hears a noise: Brahms has moved on his own.&nbsp;

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:05.440
Hours later, Malcolm returns to the house because&nbsp;
Greta called him: she needs someone else to see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:10.960
it. After lots of testing, she's discovered Brahms&nbsp;
only moves if nobody can see him. To prove it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:15.280
she draws on the floor around him with chalk, then&nbsp;
leaves the room with Malcolm. When they check on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:20.080
him after some minutes, nothing has happened.&nbsp;
But Greta wants to try again, so she asks Brahms&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:25.120
really nicely to help her. This time around, when&nbsp;
they leave and return, the doll isn't standing on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:30.720
the chalk spot anymore. Malcolm finally believes&nbsp;
her. They chat about it afterward. Greta tells him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:34.800
she thinks this is happening for a reason: her&nbsp;
ex was abusive and made her lose her pregnancy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:38.080
Malcolm now understands why this is&nbsp;
so important to her and they kiss.&nbsp;

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:43.040
Later at night, after putting Brahms to bed, Greta&nbsp;
returns to her room where she and Malcolm start&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:46.800
making out. Someone is watching them through&nbsp;
the keyhole, and the sudden noise of music&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:51.680
interrupts them. They come downstairs to find the&nbsp;
record player playing and Brahms sitting nearby.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:55.360
Greta takes the doll back to bed before going&nbsp;
to the kitchen to make some coffee while Malcolm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:59.840
tells her it would be wise for her to spend the&nbsp;
night in town. She refuses, so Malcolm tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:04.320
her another story: years ago a little girl called&nbsp;
Emily Cribs used to come over to play with Brahms.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:08.160
Her body was found not far from the&nbsp;
house the same day it caught on fire,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:11.120
and they never found the killer.&nbsp;
Greta still refuses to leave.&nbsp;

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:15.120
She checks on Brahms in his room and for&nbsp;
the first time, she gives him the good&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:19.040
night kiss before leaving for the attic.&nbsp;
There she looks at the photo album again,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:22.800
finding pictures of Emily and noticing her&nbsp;
annoyed face as Brahms stared at her creepily.&nbsp;

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:27.600
The next day, after returning to the house from&nbsp;
cleaning traps, she hears the sound of the pool&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:32.560
table. She goes there with Brahms and finds out&nbsp;
Cole has broken in. They have dinner together and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:36.800
Cole tries to convince her he's changed so she&nbsp;
would return to him. Malcolm shows up then and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:41.440
after awkward introductions, he uses the groceries&nbsp;
as an excuse to talk to Greta in private.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:44.480
He tells her he's worried Cole will&nbsp;
hurt her, but Greta says she has a plan.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:48.720
Malcolm leaves the house but not the area,&nbsp;
deciding to stay in the car just in case.&nbsp;

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:54.160
Inside, Greta brings Cole sheets and pillows&nbsp;
for him to sleep on the couch. Cole tries to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:58.560
convince her to leave together again and goes&nbsp;
for a kiss she dodges before leaving. She takes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:03.680
Brahms to his room and tells him she needs help.
Later that night, we see blood drops falling on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:07.920
Cole's face, and he wakes up to find rat bodies&nbsp;
in his bag, a message in red on the wall that says&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:11.840
"get out" and the doll sitting nearby. Greta&nbsp;
runs to him when she hears him yell her name,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:16.480
and when she gets there, he accuses her to be&nbsp;
the one behind all this. Greta grabs Brahms&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:20.640
and an angry Cole starts chasing her around,&nbsp;
Malcolm hears the screaming and gets inside to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:25.120
find Cole taking the doll from Greta. He starts&nbsp;
shaking the doll around as he yells, and tired&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:29.280
of hearing Greta and Malcolm asking to be careful&nbsp;
with Brahms, he smashes the doll against a chair.&nbsp;

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:33.680
Something starts making noise in the walls and&nbsp;
Cole approaches the mirror to try to follow it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:38.560
better. The mirror suddenly shutters, throwing&nbsp;
Cole back and revealing who was making the noises:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:43.200
a grown man wearing a porcelain mask. The real&nbsp;
Brahms, calling for Greta with the same kiddy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:48.000
voice she heard on the phone before. Brahms jumps&nbsp;
on Cole and after some struggling, he manages to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:53.040
kill him. He grabs Greta next, but Malcolm appears&nbsp;
from behind and hits him before taking Greta away.&nbsp;

00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:56.800
Brahms starts chasing them through&nbsp;
the house. Greta and Malcolm try to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:00.480
lock themselves in her room, but Brahms&nbsp;
knows the secret passages in the walls,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:04.960
so he has no trouble reaching them anywhere.&nbsp;
After running around for a while, they finally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:08.880
get a chance to escape when they find the door to&nbsp;
one of Brahms' wall passages, which they enter.&nbsp;

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:13.200
Greta and Malcolm find a hidden room: the place&nbsp;
where Brahms has been living all this time.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:17.680
He has everything he needs and more: Greta&nbsp;
finds her dress and hair on a doll Brahms made&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:21.440
to imitate her, she also finds the letter from&nbsp;
his parents saying they aren't returning and he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:26.080
could "have the girl". They go back to the hidden&nbsp;
passages and Malcolm finally catches up with them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:29.280
After some more chasing, he jumps on&nbsp;
Malcolm and knocks him out as Greta&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:33.600
finds an exit and runs away from the house.
She makes it to the gates and stops there,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:38.240
realizing she can't leave yet: she must go back&nbsp;
for Malcolm. Back in the house, she grabs a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:42.560
screwdriver that she hides in her pocket before&nbsp;
meeting with Brahms. She tells him she's come&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:47.280
back for him, then uses her authoritative nanny&nbsp;
voice to order him to go back to bed. After some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:52.640
hesitation, he obeys. Greta takes him to his room&nbsp;
and puts him to bed, and when she tries to leave,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:57.840
Brahms asks for the good night kiss. She refuses,&nbsp;
saying that's his punishment for misbehaving.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:02.240
But Brahms grabs her arm and insists, so Greta&nbsp;
has no other choice but to lean in for a kiss.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:06.880
When Brahms puts his porcelain mouth against her&nbsp;
real lips, she takes the chance to retrieve the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:11.120
screwdriver and use it on him. Brahms pushes&nbsp;
her away and after getting off the bed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:15.600
grabs her by the neck and pushes her against the&nbsp;
wall, intending to leave her without air. For&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:20.240
a moment Greta seems to be out of it, but at the&nbsp;
last second, she snaps and pushes the screwdriver&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:24.880
deeper until he collapses. The mask breaks and&nbsp;
we see Brahms' face is burnt under it. Greta&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:29.040
hurries out of the room to find Malcolm and get&nbsp;
him in the car so they can escape the house. She&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:33.520
smiles when she realizes they're finally free.
The movie ends with a pair of hands wearing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:36.240
sleeves very similar to Brahms'&nbsp;
gluing the doll back together.
