00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.560
Welcome back to Movie Recapped. Today I&nbsp;
will show you a horror film from 2002,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.160
titled Ghost Ship. Spoilers&nbsp;
ahead! Watch out and take care.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.800
The year is 1962. Aboard the ocean liner&nbsp;
Antonia Graza, the passengers are having&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.160
an evening of dinner and dancing to Francesca's&nbsp;
music. A little girl, Katie Harwood, sits alone,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.040
not having fun as the others. A waiter helps her&nbsp;
write "I'm so bored" on her little toy; afterward,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.560
the captain of the ship asks her to&nbsp;
dance with him, which she accepts.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.800
While everyone enjoys themselves, someone&nbsp;
is lifting a lever to unravel some wire.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.960
When the spool finally snaps, it makes the&nbsp;
wire whip on the dance floor, bisecting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.960
all the passengers and crew except Katie, whose&nbsp;
height's allowed the wire to pass above her head.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:49.360
Forty years later, we meet a crew of salvagers:&nbsp;
Captain Murphy, Maureen Epps, Greer, Dodge,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.640
Munder, and Santos. They're rescuing a ship that&nbsp;
is taking too much water, so Greer isn't sure they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.920
can carry it on for much longer. It was also very&nbsp;
hard to find, so Epps refuses to give up on it so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.480
soon. Using a wire to move between ships, she&nbsp;
enters the rescued boat and finds a punch in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:09.120
the port floater. Ignoring Murphy's warnings, Epps&nbsp;
starts working on repairing the hole as Munder and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.760
Dodge join her to help: she hammers on a piece&nbsp;
of metal that the men weld. Some hours later,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.600
we learn the group was successful in their rescue&nbsp;
when Murphy brings their pay to their table at a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.560
bar. They're celebrating when they're approached&nbsp;
by a man, Jack Ferriman, who wants to hire them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.480
Ferriman proceeds to tell them his story: he&nbsp;
flies the Arctic Weather Patrol Flights out of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.640
Mackenzie Bay and last month he was in the middle&nbsp;
of the Strait when he saw something. He shows them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.720
a picture of a ship in the Bering Sea, which&nbsp;
he tried to contact to no avail, so he figured&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.040
it was adrift. He told the Coast Guard about it&nbsp;
but since the ship is on international waters,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.680
they only took note of it. He never caught the&nbsp;
ship's name, but he saw it again a few days ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.320
Ferriman only asks for 20% of the findings and&nbsp;
promises he hasn't told anyone else about it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.720
Murphy asks for a minute alone with his crew.&nbsp;
After Ferriman leaves, the crew discusses&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.800
if taking this job or not: Greer is hesitant&nbsp;
because they've already been out for six months,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.720
and this would take them another week - he&nbsp;
hasn't seen his fiance in a long time. When&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.920
Murphy promises an even split, everyone accepts to&nbsp;
go, and Greer gives in as well. They call Ferriman&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.720
over and tell him they'll give him 10%, he accepts&nbsp;
under the condition he goes with them. They set&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.280
out in their tugboat at sunset, but it isn't until&nbsp;
later in the rainy night that they find something.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.840
Santos is at the wheel when he sees something&nbsp;
on the radar, so he calls Murphy over. The radar&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.400
shows nothing when the captain arrives, so he&nbsp;
thinks Santos imagined things, but seconds later,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.520
the radar shows something again. Murphy calls Epps&nbsp;
to join them and after she arrives, he tries to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.160
contact the mysterious ship while Epps notices how&nbsp;
it shows up and out of the radar by the second.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.880
Suddenly, the large ship appears in front of them,&nbsp;
so Santos has to quickly stop their boat - they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.600
don't fully crash, but the engine gets damaged.&nbsp;
They circle the liner to check it out and Murphy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.320
is surprised to see the name: Antonia Graza.&nbsp;
It's an Italian ship that was reported missing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.960
in 1962 off the coast of Labrador, but the&nbsp;
strange thing is there was no distress signal,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:58.240
it just disappeared. Since then, every captain&nbsp;
has been looking for her, but now she's theirs.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:03.440
They bring their ship closer so they can board&nbsp;
her. Greer, Santos, and Ferriman stay behind while&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:08.080
the rest of the crew goes to investigate. They&nbsp;
take note of the condition details of the liner,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.960
like life preserver lockers being&nbsp;
empty and lifeboats being gone.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.920
When they find a door, they go inside, which&nbsp;
makes Greer lost his connection to them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.480
The crew walks around different rooms, commenting&nbsp;
on the fanciness, when they hear a noise:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.960
they follow it and find a pendulum clock still&nbsp;
ticking that startles Munder when it strikes time.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:29.600
As their laughter echoes in the ship, they move&nbsp;
onto another room, on a nearby table Katie's old&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.920
toy moves on its own and misspells "welcome&nbsp;
aboard". In the tugboat, Greer is bothered by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.880
the lack of communication. But in the liner, the&nbsp;
crew keeps going without worrying much. They enter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.520
a lower level of the ship and keep looking around&nbsp;
when suddenly, the floor breaks under Munder. Epps&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:48.000
grabs him and prevents him from falling, but he's&nbsp;
left hanging and she's brought down to the floor.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.160
While desperately crying for help, Epps sees&nbsp;
Katie through the hole, but she's gone in a blink.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.440
Luckily Dodge and Murphy catch her and pull her&nbsp;
and Munder up before they get hurt. Moments later,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.360
they make it to the ship's bridge. Munder&nbsp;
finds that the compass and the helm are dead,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.080
and Dodge notices the fuel tanks are empty:&nbsp;
the ship must've ridden on until she was dried.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.800
Murphy finds log documentation on a desk, which&nbsp;
he intends to take back with him, and on another&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:16.160
table, Dodge finds a digital watch, which doesn't&nbsp;
make sense because they didn't exist in 1962.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.520
Murphy thinks they aren't the first ones to&nbsp;
find the ship, but it doesn't matter because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:23.920
it's theirs now. So he orders everyone to go&nbsp;
back, they'll start the towing in the morning.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:28.000
The crew returns to their tugboat. Ferriman&nbsp;
asks them if they were able to find out what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.360
happened to the liner, Murphy says it's&nbsp;
a very good question and tells them the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.600
story of the Marie Celeste, a ship that went&nbsp;
through the same thing as the Antonia Graza:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:40.240
she was found empty with no crew or passengers&nbsp;
and no signs of distress, she traveled for miles&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:45.040
at full sail with nobody at the helm. Ferriman&nbsp;
calls her a ghost ship, which Dodge scoffs at.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:49.840
They discuss their plan afterward: Murphy wants to&nbsp;
tug the liner along as they usually do, but Santos&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.080
doesn't think their little tugboat can pull such&nbsp;
a big ship. Greer mentions they could anchor her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.240
and come back later, but Dodge says that Russians&nbsp;
could steal her from them, and Murphy points out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.640
the anchors are gone anyway. So Greer agrees to&nbsp;
get the engines working and drag her with the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:07.120
tugboat, which will take them two weeks. But he&nbsp;
doesn't mind, since this will pay extremely well.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:12.080
Meanwhile, Epps can't stop thinking about&nbsp;
what she saw when Munder fell. Ferriman comes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.080
to check on her since she's been very quiet,&nbsp;
and Epps confesses she saw a girl on the ship,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:20.400
which is impossible. Ferriman tells her he also&nbsp;
sees things sometimes when he's been flying for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:25.280
too long, and she finds his words comforting. The&nbsp;
next morning, the crew goes scuba-diving to check&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:29.840
on the state of the liner's hull. They confirm&nbsp;
she has a hole and is sinking, she probably got&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:34.880
hit around a week ago. Back inside the tugboat,&nbsp;
they discuss their options. The ship is caught&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:38.800
in a strong current loop that has been slowly&nbsp;
pushing her towards a nearby group of rocks,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.520
they must fix her before she gets hit again. They&nbsp;
have three days to do it, but Munder mentions all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.760
the things they need to work on and points out&nbsp;
three days aren't enough. Santos also thinks he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:52.560
doesn't have enough gear to fix the engine. Murphy&nbsp;
orders everyone to do it anyway. When Greer says&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:56.640
he's going to call this in following marine law,&nbsp;
Murphy forbids it, he doesn't want any guests.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:01.120
Santos stays in the tugboat working on the engine&nbsp;
while the rest of the crew boards the liner to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:05.760
do a full recon before they start working on the&nbsp;
repairs. They divide the group into pairs to work&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:09.760
on different areas, Greer and Murphy are together&nbsp;
but Murphy doesn't allow Greer to enter the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:14.240
captain's room with him when they find it. Munder&nbsp;
and Dodge are going through a flooded lower level,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:18.720
heading to the main engine room, when they realize&nbsp;
they're unable to use their walkie-talkies.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:22.080
Meanwhile, Epps is supposed to be with&nbsp;
Ferriman, but she seems to be alone when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:26.720
she finds a room with a swimming pool. She gets&nbsp;
inside the pool and finds holes on its walls,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:31.600
plus bullets on the floor. When she decides&nbsp;
to leave, she starts to climb the pool stairs,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:36.880
only to find Katie at the top. Startled, she&nbsp;
falls back into the pool and loses consciousness.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:41.600
In the meantime, Greer continues to look around&nbsp;
while Murphy checks out the captain's room. After&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:46.480
finding the captain's hat, he checks the bathroom,&nbsp;
where he finds blood and a razor on the sink.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:51.120
The other members of the crew are finding weird&nbsp;
clues as well: Greer sees the elevator has fallen,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:55.280
and when Dodge and Munder make it to the engine&nbsp;
room, they discover it's totally flooded.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:58.800
They try to tell the others, but all&nbsp;
they get is static on the talkies.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:02.960
In the pool, Epps is waking up, unaware that&nbsp;
the blood from her head wound is being absorbed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:07.680
by the holes on the floor. She asks for Katie to&nbsp;
wait, but the only person there now is Ferriman.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:11.200
He helps her get out as a different&nbsp;
hole on the wall starts spouting blood.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:15.680
Back in the captain's room, Murphy finds a glass&nbsp;
of whiskey and when he's about to drink it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:19.760
he looks up and finds that the reflection on&nbsp;
the mirror is not his but the liner's captain's.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:23.760
Startled, he drops the glass and leaves the room&nbsp;
while the mirror shows the old captain again.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:28.400
Meanwhile, Ferriman and Epps discuss what the&nbsp;
bullets could mean as more holes start spouting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:32.640
blood, filling the pool with it. Bodies can&nbsp;
be seen floating as Ferriman and Epps leave.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:38.080
Suddenly, Francesca's singing can be heard over&nbsp;
the walkie-talkies. While Greer follows the voice&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:42.560
into a dining room, Ferriman and Epps find the&nbsp;
central laundry, and Epps decides to check if the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:47.600
vent is flooded. As soon as she opens it, a strong&nbsp;
wave of water comes out, further flooding the room&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:52.480
and revealing bodies that can only be around a&nbsp;
month old. As the door closes on its own, Epps&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:56.800
tries to contact Murphy to tell him they should&nbsp;
get off this ship, but the talkies aren't working.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:01.360
They try to leave the way they came in, but since&nbsp;
it's locked now, they take a different side door.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:05.520
Meanwhile, in the dining room, Greer finds&nbsp;
a piano on the stage, and on top of it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:10.080
an ashtray with a cigarette that is still lighted&nbsp;
and has lipstick on it. He also admires a picture&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:15.120
of Francesca, unaware that she's watching him from&nbsp;
afar. Back to Ferriman and Epps, they're moving&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:19.840
through a hallway when Ferriman suddenly enters&nbsp;
a room, excited to find an old car. Epps tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:24.720
him they should go, but stops when she realizes&nbsp;
there's something moving under a pile of mailbags.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:29.280
They kick the bags off and open the box under it,&nbsp;
revealing a bunch of rats that startle Epps and,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:34.880
most importantly, many bars of gold. As they leave&nbsp;
the room, Epps tries to contact Murphy again,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:38.880
but on the talkie only there's only static and&nbsp;
a strange voice that calls out her name and asks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:43.680
for help because it's cold. They keep moving and&nbsp;
find the galley, Epps decides to open the fridge&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:48.000
even if Ferriman warns her not to. She enters&nbsp;
the fridge and is suddenly jumped on by two&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.400
people inside meat bags that chase her out and&nbsp;
back to the galley. These people turn out to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:56.320
Dodge and Munder playing a prank, Epps interrupts&nbsp;
their laughter by telling them about the bodies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:01.120
and the gold. Moments later, the whole crew has&nbsp;
reunited and gone to the cargo hold to open the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:05.840
rest of the boxes. They all contain gold bars,&nbsp;
and the crew immediately starts celebrating their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:10.480
newfound fortune, but Greer is worried they may be&nbsp;
insured. Dodge points out the markings have been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:15.440
filed down, so the owner must've wanted the bars&nbsp;
to be untraceable. Greer thinks it's stolen then,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:20.560
and Murphy thinks this may be why the ship&nbsp;
disappeared. Munder says that explains 1962,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:24.880
but the bodies they've found are recent, which&nbsp;
causes Greer to confess he heard a woman singing,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:29.280
making the others laugh at him. Epps proposes&nbsp;
to call the Coast Guard, but Dodge points out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:33.920
they could equal trouble if the gold truly was&nbsp;
stolen. Murphy reminds them that anything found in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:38.560
international waters is finders keepers, so they&nbsp;
agree to take the gold and leave the ship behind.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:42.320
Greer and Santos go back to the boat&nbsp;
while the others get the boxes ready.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:45.760
As an invisible force opens a propane&nbsp;
tank in the boat's engine room,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:50.000
Katie appears in front of Epps and warns her&nbsp;
to stop what they're doing, but it's too late.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.400
Another ghost pushes Katie away as Greer starts&nbsp;
the boat, causing the engine room to explode.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:59.680
Santos catches fire and jumps into the water&nbsp;
right before the rest of the boat also explodes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:03.840
Desperate to help, Epps jumps into the water&nbsp;
too and manages to rescue Greer while Ferriman&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:09.280
appears by her side, having found Munder. Santos&nbsp;
is nowhere to be seen, but Katie's observing from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:14.640
afar. A few moments later, the crew is back in&nbsp;
the liner. While Epps tends to Greer's wounds,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:18.400
Dodge gets angry at Ferriman for not having&nbsp;
investigated this ship better and tells him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:23.840
it's his fault Santos is dead. He intends to&nbsp;
punch him, but Greer stops him. Afterward, Epps&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:28.640
goes to the deck, where Murphy is sitting alone&nbsp;
and blaming himself. She tries to comfort him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:32.720
but he just silently leaves. Epps returns to&nbsp;
the room with the others and tells them they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:36.960
should try to repair the ship so they can return&nbsp;
home or at least survive until they're rescued.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:40.320
Greer would rather build a raft, but&nbsp;
Munder thinks it's not a good idea,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:44.720
and he asks Epps to wait until morning to start&nbsp;
repairs under good light, which she accepts,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:48.960
but Greer doesn't. He doesn't think Epps can&nbsp;
guide them through this and keeps on complaining,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:53.680
causing Munder to insult him. Greer punches him&nbsp;
for it, and Ferriman and Dodge have to drag him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:58.880
away. As it gets late in the night, we see Katie&nbsp;
dancing around the swimming pool, Murphy returning&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:03.120
to the captain's room to grab the whiskey bottle,&nbsp;
Epps finding Katie on the passengers' list,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:07.280
Ferriman hanging out in the communications room,&nbsp;
Dodge and Munder competing to see who tries the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:12.080
old food first, and Greer drinking and talking&nbsp;
to a picture of his fiancé in the dining room.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:15.800
While Dodge and Munder discover the food&nbsp;
is in good condition but has worms in it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:20.240
Epps walks through a hallway trying to find Katie.&nbsp;
All the doors suddenly close around her except for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:25.200
one, where Epps can hear humming. She enters the&nbsp;
room and finds Katie's toys, clothes and drawings,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:30.400
but when the closet suddenly opens, she finds&nbsp;
her body as well. Meanwhile, in the dining room,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:34.320
Greer watches how the room puts itself&nbsp;
back together and people appear around him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:38.880
including Francesca on the stage. Back in the&nbsp;
captain's room, the whiskey bottle is moving&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:43.280
and wakes Murphy up, only for him to find the old&nbsp;
captain sitting across from him and offering him a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:48.720
drink. Back to Greer, he's being approached by&nbsp;
Francesca, who kisses his cheek to seduce him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:52.720
He decides that since this isn't real it won't&nbsp;
count as cheating and he can go along with it, so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:57.840
he kisses her on the mouth. In the meantime, Epps&nbsp;
retrieves a locket from Katie's body and opens it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:02.000
finding pictures of her parents. She's about&nbsp;
to close it when Katie appears behind her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.160
asking her not to close it because she&nbsp;
hasn't seen it in years. After some chitchat,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:10.080
Epps tries to give her the locket back,&nbsp;
but it goes through Katie's ghost hand.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:14.000
While in the dining room Francesca gets&nbsp;
Greer to follow her by taking off her dress,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.560
in the captain's room Murphy starts talking to the&nbsp;
captain's ghost. The captain shows him pictures&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:23.280
of a ship they rescued two days before the Graza&nbsp;
disappeared, it was that ship that had the gold.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:28.080
Murphy recognizes her as the Lorelei and from the&nbsp;
tales, he knows there were no survivors on her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:31.760
But the captain shakes his head and shows him&nbsp;
a picture of the one person that was aboard,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:36.720
causing Murphy to curse. In the meantime, Greer&nbsp;
continues to follow Francesca around while Epps&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:40.720
gets an explanation from Katie. She says all&nbsp;
the ghosts are trapped there because when the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:44.800
ship has all the souls she needs and fills&nbsp;
her quota, they'll be ferried. She doesn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:48.880
get to say where they'll be ferried because&nbsp;
suddenly, blood starts appearing on the ceiling.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:52.880
Katie says "he" doesn't want her to talk to Epps&nbsp;
and asks her to get off before she disappears.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:57.760
Meanwhile, Murphy has entered the pool room,&nbsp;
looking for Epps, but he keeps seeing Santos'&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:02.640
ghost everywhere. Back to Greer and Francesca,&nbsp;
she's finished undressing and Greer comes closer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:07.520
to touch her, but he goes through her and falls&nbsp;
into the elevator shaft, instantly dying. In the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:11.600
hallways of the ship, Epps has found Ferriman&nbsp;
and together they come across Murphy, who can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:16.480
only see them as Santos trying to attack him. This&nbsp;
causes him to defend himself and fight Epps, but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:21.520
Ferriman manages to knock him out by hitting him&nbsp;
from behind. A moment later, after reuniting with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:26.400
Dodge and Munder, together they lock Murphy in the&nbsp;
aquarium for their safety. As the morning comes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:30.800
Epps is watching Murphy in the tank, and the other&nbsp;
three come back saying they couldn't find Greer.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:36.040
Epps asks them to stick to the plan and try to fix&nbsp;
the boat. A moment later, Epps, Dodge and Munder&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:41.040
go diving into the engine room, and after forcing&nbsp;
the door open, work on fixing the hull. They&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:45.840
think it'll hold, so they get out and test it. The&nbsp;
ship is indeed working now, and Epps moves to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:49.600
bridge to steer her, noticing how the current is&nbsp;
taking them to the rock faster than they thought.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:54.080
She goes back to Dodge and Munder and tells them&nbsp;
to keep control of the drift while she goes down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:58.480
below to see if she can find Greer. When she&nbsp;
makes it down there, she finds Greer's body&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:03.280
and Katie again. While the men discover a clog in&nbsp;
the engine room, Epps is touched by Katie to show&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:07.840
her memories of what happened. The ship's crew&nbsp;
killed all the passengers through various methods,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:12.000
then they turned on each other when the time came&nbsp;
to divide the gold. The last standing officer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.400
was approached and killed by Francesca, who in&nbsp;
return was tricked and killed by the mastermind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:21.280
behind all this: the Lorelei's last survivor,&nbsp;
Ferriman. He's also the one that caused the boat&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:25.600
explosion and, Epps is learning now through these&nbsp;
visions, filled the aquarium to drown Murphy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:30.800
Upset by this news, Epps runs to check on her&nbsp;
captain, but it's too late: the vision was true.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:35.280
Back in the engine room, Munder is diving to&nbsp;
fix the clog while Dodge takes the wheel at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:40.080
bridge. Epps shows up then and tells him about&nbsp;
Murphy, Ferriman soon follows but she decides&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:44.720
not to say what she knows. After giving Dodge a&nbsp;
gun she found in the lower levels, she leaves to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:49.680
check on Munder, asking the other two not to leave&nbsp;
the bridge. In the engine room, Munder is crushed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:53.440
by the ship's gears, and Epps arrives to guess&nbsp;
what happened when seeing the blood in the water.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.640
Meanwhile, on the bridge, Ferriman taunts Dodge&nbsp;
by calling him a coward for doing everything Epps&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:03.120
says but still won't confess his feelings for her.&nbsp;
He tries to leave the room and Dodge shoots him to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:08.160
stop him. Back to the engine room, Epps is setting&nbsp;
up explosives when she's approached by Dodge.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:12.080
He gets angry when he discovers she wants to&nbsp;
blow up the ship, but Epps is suspicious because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:16.560
he hasn't asked about Munder. Dodge laughs and&nbsp;
reveals he's Ferriman, who took Dodge's place&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:21.280
after killing him. Ferriman is a demonic spirit&nbsp;
whose job is to fill the ship with souls and,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:25.360
once she's full, takes the ship to hell. He&nbsp;
offers her to live in exchange for the ship,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:30.240
but she doesn't accept, so he makes a beam hit her&nbsp;
and send her to the water. He jumps after her and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:35.200
tries to drown her, but Epps finds a crossbow on&nbsp;
the floor so, after pushing Ferriman off her, she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:40.240
shoots the detonator, causing the ship to explode.&nbsp;
All the souls are freed and Katie appears in front&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:44.880
of Epps to guide her to the surface. Epps swims up&nbsp;
and holds onto some rubble for hours until a ship&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:49.760
arrives to rescue her. The movie ends hours later,&nbsp;
with Epps back on land and being loaded into an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:54.400
ambulance. When she opens her eyes, she notices&nbsp;
some officers loading the gold into another&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:58.800
ship and Ferriman following them. She tries to&nbsp;
scream, but the doors are closed on her face.
