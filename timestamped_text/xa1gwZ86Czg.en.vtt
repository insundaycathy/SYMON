00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.080
Story Recapped here. Today, I'm going&nbsp;
to explain an action, adventure,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.800
drama film called “War for the Planet of the&nbsp;
Apes.” Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.920
Years ago, a scientific experiment gone wrong&nbsp;
gave rise to a species of intelligent apes, but it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.280
destroyed most of humanity in the form of the flu.&nbsp;
A new ape civilization lead by Caesar struggled&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.880
to coexist with the humans and eventually&nbsp;
resulted in a fight when a rebel ape named Koba&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.520
led a vengeful attack against the humans. The&nbsp;
humans were able to send a distress call to a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.360
military base in the North and prompted a&nbsp;
ruthless Colonel with his battalion to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.360
dispatched and exterminate the apes. Caesar&nbsp;
evaded the Colonel for years and was rumored&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.240
to be marshaling a fight from a hidden&nbsp;
base in the woods as the war rages on.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.960
In the present, deep in the woods, a group of&nbsp;
human soldiers, with the help of Koba’s former&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.520
subordinates, sneakily finds an ape encampment.&nbsp;
The soldiers launch a sudden bombarding attack&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.440
and kill a lot of apes. One of the apes signals&nbsp;
the rest of the ape army for backup, and they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.920
immediately launch a heavy counterattack, wiping&nbsp;
almost all of the soldiers. One of them, Preacher,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.920
survives and tries to call the Colonel for&nbsp;
backup but is caught by the hoard of apes.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:06.880
Caesar, along with his subordinates, Maurice,&nbsp;
Luca, and Winter, arrive at the encampment,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.720
where they meet the surviving humans. Preacher&nbsp;
recognizes Caesar and tells him that they were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.640
looking for him and thought he was dead. Caesar&nbsp;
explains that it was not him who wanted war, but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.280
his former ally, Koba. Caesar further tells them&nbsp;
that Koba is already dead and he only fought to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.800
protect his tribe. Koba’s former subordinate, Red&nbsp;
Donkey, who was also captured, tells Caesar about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.880
the ruthlessness of the Colonel and threatens&nbsp;
him. This angers the apes, so Caesar commands&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.520
Winter to take Red Donkey outside. Caesar lets the&nbsp;
captured soldiers go as a message offering peace&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.080
to the Colonel. Winter, however, returns to Caesar&nbsp;
and tells him that Red Donkey managed to escape.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.800
At the lake, Caesar expresses his regrets about&nbsp;
Koba to Maurice, telling him that his actions’&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.240
consequences still haunts them. Maurice&nbsp;
comforts Caesar and tells him that no one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.840
could’ve predicted Koba’s rebellion. Shortly&nbsp;
after, Caesar’s son, Blue-Eyes and his friend,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.240
Rocket, arrives home from a long journey.&nbsp;
Blue-eyes tells Caesar that he bears good&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.680
news from their travels so Caesar immediately&nbsp;
takes them home to their hidden base at a cave&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.840
behind a waterfall. The apes then have a meeting&nbsp;
about their plans. Blue-eyes tells them that they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.040
discovered a new place to call home and that&nbsp;
humans will not be able to follow them there.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.880
This excites the apes but Winter urges them&nbsp;
that they should leave immediately for fear&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.040
that the humans may attack. Caesar silences&nbsp;
Winter and agrees to Blue-eyes’ suggestion that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.280
they be more tactful about their next move. Caesar&nbsp;
reassures everyone that they will leave together.

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.800
When night falls, Caesar stays vigilant with his&nbsp;
sleeping family. He then notices an unusual green&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.960
light passing down the waterfall in front of&nbsp;
him. Curious, Caesar approaches the waterfall&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.280
and discovers a rope, telling him that the humans&nbsp;
have invaded them again. Caesar tells Blue-eyes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.600
to stay on guard and protect his family while he&nbsp;
looks for the invading humans. Caesar meets Luca&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.520
and notifies him of the attack. Back in the&nbsp;
bedroom, Blue-eyes sees one of the soldiers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.600
entering and beats him to death. Meanwhile,&nbsp;
Caesar manages to ambush one of the soldiers,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.760
but not before the soldier made contact with his&nbsp;
Colonel. The apes hear the Colonel’s response,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.280
telling the soldier that he killed the ape’s&nbsp;
leader. This prompts Caesar to hurry back to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.200
his family, where he meets the Colonel,&nbsp;
who is preparing to escape, eye to eye.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.960
The Colonel realizes that he killed the wrong&nbsp;
ape and looks at their bodies once more.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.600
Caesar follows his gaze, and to his demise, he&nbsp;
sees Blue-eyes and his wife dead. The Colonel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.080
attempts to kill the infuriated ape, but Caesar&nbsp;
dodges the attack. The rest of the apes arrive,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.320
and the Colonel fires to slow them down, and he&nbsp;
escapes. Caesar chases the Colonel on the rope&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.640
he was retreating to. As Caesar is about to catch&nbsp;
up, the Colonel pulls his army knife and cuts the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.960
rope. Caesar falls down the river and swims away&nbsp;
to safety, looking at the escaping Colonel once&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:27.440
more with a vengeance. Caesar returns to his room&nbsp;
and mourns with the rest of his friends. To his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.720
comfort, Caesar finds his younger son, Cornelius,&nbsp;
hiding amidst the fight earlier and embraces him.

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:34.880
Due to the attack from last night,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.200
Caesar relocates the entire tribe to the new&nbsp;
place Blue-eyes told them about. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.880
Caesar stays to seek vengeance while stalling&nbsp;
the soldiers from catching up to the apes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.840
The apes embark on their journey while Caesar&nbsp;
makes his way to where the Colonel is stationed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.040
Unbeknownst to him, Maurice, Rocket, and Luca are&nbsp;
following him. Caesar tells them that he should&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.880
fight alone and that he may not make it back&nbsp;
alive. But the apes insist that Caesar needs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.240
their help and they will make sure not to let him&nbsp;
die, so the four apes embark on their journey.

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.040
On the way, the apes find an abandoned village&nbsp;
and explore the place. They then find a human who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.520
is gathering firewood. The human hastily picks&nbsp;
up his gun to shoot, but before he could fire,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:12.160
Caesar shoots him. Suddenly, a noise breaks out&nbsp;
from one of the houses. The apes aggressively&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.800
enter the house, expecting another hostile, but&nbsp;
to their surprise, they find a young girl lying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:20.800
on her bed. Caesar deems her harmless, so&nbsp;
he commands everyone to search the place and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:25.440
take what they can. Maurice, however, sees that&nbsp;
something is wrong with the girl and feels sorry,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.440
so he converses with her. Maurice asks Caesar&nbsp;
to bring the girl as she won’t survive alone.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.840
Caesar is hesitant but takes her with them anyway.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.240
The group continues to look for the human&nbsp;
encampment and eventually finds one. They&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.840
scout the place from afar with their binoculars,&nbsp;
but instead of finding the Colonel, they see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.920
Winter working with the humans. That night, the&nbsp;
group sneakily finds their way to Winter’s tent,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:48.400
startling the white ape. Caesar immediately&nbsp;
asks about the Colonel’s whereabouts. Winter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.760
tells Caesar that the Colonel is no longer at the&nbsp;
camp and that he’s making his way at the border to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:56.000
meet more soldiers coming from the North. Caesar&nbsp;
asks about the border to which Winter is oblivious&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.840
about. Winter tells Caesar that after Red Donkey&nbsp;
bargained with him that if he tells them where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.000
Caesar was hiding, the Colonel will spare his&nbsp;
life. Caesar remembers his family and gets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.240
infuriated, telling Winter that his son and wife&nbsp;
died because of what he did. Winter gets nervous&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.880
but notices some soldiers outside his tent, so he&nbsp;
attempts to call for help. Caesar and the group&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:16.720
immediately stop Winter before he could make a&nbsp;
sound. They were able to prevent the soldiers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:20.400
from suspecting, but Caesar accidentally chokes&nbsp;
Winter and kills him while holding Winter down.

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:25.280
Later that night, Caesar thinks about what he&nbsp;
did and feels guilty. His guilt drives him to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:29.280
see Koba’s ghost amidst the camp, reminding him&nbsp;
that apes don’t kill each other. Maurice tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:33.680
Caesar that the soldiers are leaving, so the group&nbsp;
follows them. On a snowy mountainous place, the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:38.720
group finds the soldiers stopping for some reason.&nbsp;
Suddenly, they hear gunshots. As they hide,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:42.880
the gunshots continue, and the group wonders where&nbsp;
they were shooting at. When the soldiers leave and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:47.360
the blizzard stops, the group examines the place&nbsp;
and finds dead bodies barely buried in the snow.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.280
They examine the bodies, removing the sackcloth&nbsp;
covering the heads, and finds one of the bodies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:56.480
still alive but in great agony. Caesar tries to&nbsp;
ask why he has been shot, but the man can’t speak.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:59.360
Caesar then looks back at the young girl&nbsp;
and realizes that they are the same.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:02.640
Feeling pity for the man’s hopeless&nbsp;
state, Caesar ends his suffering.

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:08.000
The group loses track of the soldiers, so they try&nbsp;
scouting the area from a tower. At the same time,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.240
a thief wearing a jacket approaches one of the&nbsp;
horses. The girl is distracted by her toy, so the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:16.640
thief tries to steal their belongings. Luca looks&nbsp;
down and sees the thief, and lets out a massive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:20.800
roar. The thief steals the horse and makes a run&nbsp;
for it. The group immediately makes chase, but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.960
the thief is faster. The chase eventually stops&nbsp;
when the thief leaves his horse at an abandoned&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:29.200
mansion. The group catches up with the thief who&nbsp;
has surrendered and shows himself to be an ape.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:34.320
The ape introduces himself as Bad Ape but he&nbsp;
doesn’t understand the apes’ sign language.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:38.240
Bad Ape tells his story, telling them that he&nbsp;
is from the zoo where Caesar was once from.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:42.560
Bad Ape tells them that the other apes died a long&nbsp;
time ago and that he is the only one who survived.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:46.560
Bad Ape is happy that he is not alone and thus&nbsp;
gives them food to celebrate. Caesar looks at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:50.480
food and asks Bad Ape where it is from. Bad Ape&nbsp;
replies that he found them from the border where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:55.120
the soldiers are. Caesar insists that Bad Ape take&nbsp;
them there, but Bad Ape refuses due to his fear.

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:58.800
The group stays for the night. Bad&nbsp;
Ape asks Caesar about the girl.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:02.720
Caesar replies that the girl has no&nbsp;
one but them. Bad Ape tells Caesar&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:05.920
that he looks sad and asks him if he&nbsp;
has children. Caesar tells him about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:10.320
his family. Bad Ape sympathizes and tells&nbsp;
him that he also has a child at the border.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:14.560
Bad Ape makes a deal with Caesar. If they help him&nbsp;
find his child, he will take them to the border.

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:18.160
The next morning the group leaves&nbsp;
for the border with Bad Ape’s guide.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:22.400
When they arrive, Caesar commands Luca that they&nbsp;
scout the place from a closer distance. But while&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:27.200
they are scouting, patrolling humans spot them.&nbsp;
Luca pushes Caesar away and kills one of them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:31.120
The other human threatens to kill Caesar,&nbsp;
but Rocket immediately comes to the rescue.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:35.200
Luca is fatally injured from the fight and the&nbsp;
group retreats to a safer place. They grieve for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:39.520
Luca as he draws his final breaths. Maurice now&nbsp;
pleads to Caesar that he should stop his quest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:44.240
and join the other apes. Rocket objects and&nbsp;
insists on avenging Luca. Maurice then frankly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:48.560
tells Caesar that he is becoming more like Koba.&nbsp;
Caesar is furious and tells them to join the other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:52.720
apes and goes to the encampment alone.
 
Caesar makes his way to the encampment.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:56.480
Along the way, he finds some of his apes&nbsp;
killed and their bodies tied to a stake.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.480 --> 00:08:00.000
Caesar hurries towards the edge to see the&nbsp;
encampment, and to his despair, his entire&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.080
civilization is already imprisoned there. One&nbsp;
of the apes behind him is still alive, so he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:08.320
immediately frees him and asks him what happened.&nbsp;
The ape tells him that they were ambushed, but the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:12.400
Colonel didn’t kill them and instead turned them&nbsp;
into slaves. Before the ape could finish talking,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:16.720
he dies. Suddenly, Red Donkey hits Caesar&nbsp;
from behind the head and knocks him out.

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:21.040
When Caesar wakes up, he finds himself inside the&nbsp;
encampment with the Colonel. The Colonel tells him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:24.960
that he’s curious why Caesar isn’t with the tribe&nbsp;
and asks him if he has come to save his apes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:28.800
Caesar replies that he came to kill him. The&nbsp;
Colonel then asks him who he killed that night&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:32.720
and Caesar answers. The Colonel tells him that&nbsp;
he meant to come there to kill him and apologizes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:37.120
for his loss. He then asks Caesar how he found&nbsp;
him, to which Caesar answers that someone told&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:40.320
him and that more soldiers are coming from&nbsp;
the North to join him wipe out the apes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:43.680
The Colonel somewhat disregards the matter,&nbsp;
and they take Caesar outside and puts him in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:48.080
one of the cages. There are two cages, one&nbsp;
for the adult and one for the younglings.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:51.440
Caesar sees his son Cornelius calling&nbsp;
to him from the younglings’ cage.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:54.720
Caesar, at the sight of the apes, rethinks&nbsp;
everything and regrets his actions.

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:59.520
When morning comes, the soldiers open the cages,&nbsp;
and the enemy apes start lashing the prisoned apes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:04.240
forcing them to do their slave work. It turns out&nbsp;
that the apes were forced to build a wall. Caesar&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:07.920
wonders why the humans need a wall and starts&nbsp;
observing the area and sees defense turrets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:11.760
on the walls. One of the apes tells him that the&nbsp;
tribe is starving and they haven’t been given food&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:16.320
or water for days. While this is going on, one of&nbsp;
the weakened apes gets into an accident and causes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:21.200
a scene. The soldier commands Red Donkey to punish&nbsp;
the ape, and he proceeds to lash him with a whip.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:25.360
Caesar commands Red Donkey to stop. The apes&nbsp;
revolt with Caesar and they start raising their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:29.280
voices against the soldiers. The Colonel then&nbsp;
commands one of his soldiers and Red Donkey to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:34.080
bring Caesar. They force Caesar to kneel, and Red&nbsp;
Donkey starts lashing him in front of the Colonel.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:37.920
When the lashing stops, the Colonel tells&nbsp;
Caesar to command his apes back to work.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:42.080
Caesar refuses and tells him they need food and&nbsp;
water. The Colonel then shoots the weakened ape,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:46.480
points the gun at Caesar, and starts a countdown,&nbsp;
pressuring the infuriated ape to obey him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:50.320
Seeing the standoff, one of the apes initiates&nbsp;
the work and the rest of the apes follow.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:54.080
This stops the Colonel, but he commands&nbsp;
Red Donkey to string Caesar in a stake.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:57.440
While this is happening, Maurice and&nbsp;
the group are watching from a distance.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:59.760
They see the state of the apes&nbsp;
and plan for a way to save them.

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:04.160
Later that night, Red Donkey releases Caesar&nbsp;
from the strings and tells him that the Colonel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:08.320
wants to see him. At the command center, the&nbsp;
Colonel warns Caesar that if he dares interrupts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:13.040
the work again, he will kill his tribe one by&nbsp;
one. Caesar continues to demand food and water,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:17.760
or else they won’t finish the work. The Colonel&nbsp;
reminds him who’s in charge. Caesar then tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:21.200
the Colonel about his observations, that the&nbsp;
army’s coming from the North aren’t allies but are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:25.520
against the Colonel. The Colonel is surprised and&nbsp;
impressed at Caesar’s perception and intelligence.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:28.560
The Colonel explains that they are fighting&nbsp;
because the apes will eventually outclass the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:32.720
humans, for it is the law of nature. He then&nbsp;
explains to Caesar that the virus that almost&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:36.720
wiped them out has mutated and started taking&nbsp;
away their ability to speak or think properly.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:40.240
It started with the Colonel’s son, whom he had&nbsp;
to kill with his own hands to protect the rest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:44.800
of humanity. After that, the Colonel ruthlessly&nbsp;
purged everyone who had the infection, prompting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:48.640
armies from the North to stop them. The Colonel&nbsp;
makes his purpose clear, to prevent the apes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:52.080
from dominating the planet, so he tells Caesar&nbsp;
that he is glad that he killed Caesar’s kin.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:56.160
Caesar immediately lunges at him, but&nbsp;
Red Donkey and Preacher stops him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:59.920
The Colonel stands backs to his feet and&nbsp;
tells Caesar that he is too irrational.

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:03.600
That same night, Maurice and the group position&nbsp;
themselves closer to the camp to get a better&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:08.240
look. Maurice and Rocket are looking for ways to&nbsp;
go in, but Bad Ape insists that they shouldn’t.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:11.920
They hear some soldiers coming, so the group&nbsp;
retreats to a safer spot, where Bad Ape&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:16.320
accidentally falls to a tunnel. The next morning,&nbsp;
the soldiers finally distribute food and water to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:20.800
the apes except for Caesar, who is still tied to&nbsp;
a stake. Maurice and the group search the tunnel,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:24.240
and they find a soft spot where they could easily&nbsp;
dig out a path that leads directly inside the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:29.120
camp. Bad Ape and the young girl heads back out,&nbsp;
and they both see Caesar in agony. The young girl&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:32.720
is worried about Caesar, so she heads over to&nbsp;
the camp despite Bad Ape trying to stop her.

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:38.080
Caesar is freezing and starts to hallucinate about&nbsp;
Koba again. Koba tells Caesar to give up and join&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:41.840
him. Caesar then realizes that Red Donkey is&nbsp;
in front of him while he is hallucinating.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:46.960
Red Donkey releases Caesar under the Colonel’s&nbsp;
commands, forcing him to work. While Caesar is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:50.960
sleeping in his cage, the young girl makes her&nbsp;
way in undetected and hands Caesar her doll.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:54.160
She then proceeds to aid him with the help&nbsp;
of the rest of the apes, giving him water to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:58.480
drink and food to eat. The apes then show their&nbsp;
determination to persevere and remind Caesar that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:03.360
they are strong together. Suddenly, soldiers are&nbsp;
approaching the cages, endangering the young girl.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:07.200
Maurice and the group see this, so Rocket enters&nbsp;
the camp and makes a scene to distract the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:11.920
soldiers from the girl. The soldiers immediately&nbsp;
surround Rocket, and Red Donkey approaches him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:16.000
Rocket then tackles Red Donkey, and the two&nbsp;
beat each other until the Colonel stops them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.880
The Colonel is now suspicious of&nbsp;
other apes who might still be outside,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:23.200
so he orders a patrol and puts Rocket in the&nbsp;
pen. Red Donkey beats Rocket some more before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:27.360
leaving. Rocket then gets up, determined,&nbsp;
and tells Caesar to prepare for an escape.

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:31.040
The next morning, the Colonel releases Caesar&nbsp;
from his cage to work, but he finds the doll&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:34.880
the girl gave Caesar. The Colonel wonders what&nbsp;
the doll is and how it got there but dismisses&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:39.040
Caesar for work. Rocket and Caesar work together&nbsp;
to count the steps that lead towards the pens,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:42.080
and they communicate with Maurice&nbsp;
and Bad Ape by sign language.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:45.920
Maurice and Bad Ape immediately head back&nbsp;
to the tunnel and start tracing the steps.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:49.760
That night, the apes head back to the pen,&nbsp;
and Red Donkey chains Caesar back to his cage.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:53.920
Red Donkey tells Caesar that the Colonel&nbsp;
will kill the apes once the war is over.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:57.680
Caesar replies that the Colonel will not&nbsp;
win. He then intimidates Red Donkey by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:02.240
telling him that he too will not survive. Red&nbsp;
Donkey is speechless and leaves. Meanwhile,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:05.600
the young girl who was watching the apes hurries&nbsp;
to Maurice to notify him that the apes are back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:10.080
on their pens. Maurice commends her and shows&nbsp;
his gratitude by telling her that she is brave.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:14.240
Maurice then gives her the name Nova to which&nbsp;
she happily accepts. Bad Ape finishes digging&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:18.480
the soft ground above, and they sneakily check&nbsp;
on the pen. When the soldiers leave the pen, the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:23.760
apes immediately meet Bad Ape to thank him, and he&nbsp;
proceeds to introduce himself. Maurice, however,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:28.240
notices that the tunnel is flooding, making them&nbsp;
unable to dig towards the younglings. They inform&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:32.640
Caesar, and Caesar immediately improvises. The&nbsp;
apes taunt the watchman by throwing mud at him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:36.720
prompting him to enter the pen by himself and&nbsp;
threatening the apes. Rocket continues throwing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:40.240
mud at the soldier, baiting him to their pitfall&nbsp;
trap and relieving him of his keys and gun.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:45.040
Rocket and Caesar sneakily make their way to the&nbsp;
younglings, where Caesar reunites with Cornelius.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:48.560
They then guide the younglings to the main pen,&nbsp;
and the apes begin escaping through the tunnel.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:52.080
Caesar, however, stays behind to&nbsp;
settle his score with the Colonel.

00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:57.200
Suddenly, the armies from the North arrive and&nbsp;
attack the base. The soldiers immediately prepare&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:01.840
to defend themselves. Preacher, however, notices&nbsp;
that the apes are gone and the pens were empty.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:06.880
Outside the camp, the firing slows down the&nbsp;
apes’ escape as the enemy jets bombard the walls.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:10.960
Caesar finds himself in the command room and&nbsp;
sees the Colonel in his bed. Caesar picks up a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:15.040
gun and is about to shoot the Colonel. But to&nbsp;
his surprise, the Colonel is infected and is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:19.680
unable to speak. He sees the doll and realizes&nbsp;
what happened. The Colonel then pulls Caesar’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:24.000
hand and points the gun to himself, wanting to&nbsp;
die. This pressures Caesar, wanting to pull the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.560
trigger to exact revenge, but in the end, Caesar&nbsp;
couldn’t do it, so he puts the gun down and feels&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:32.480
sorry for the poor Colonel. The agonizing Colonel&nbsp;
then reaches for the gun and shoots himself.

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:36.880
War continues to rage outside when one of&nbsp;
the soldiers in the frontline alongside Red&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:41.440
Donkey spots the escaping apes. They shoot them&nbsp;
down, killing a number of them. Caesar heads&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:45.360
out and sees this, taking a pack of grenades&nbsp;
with him and jumping out. On the frontline,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:49.680
Red Donkey starts to realize what he’s done and&nbsp;
feels sorry for the apes. A soldier commands the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:54.480
donkey to grab a grenade launcher, and while doing&nbsp;
so, he sees Caesar running towards them. Caesar&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:57.840
is about to throw a grenade at a gas tank when&nbsp;
suddenly he gets shot with an arrow by Preacher.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:02.480
Caesar is pinned down, and Preacher is about&nbsp;
to deal the final blow, but he explodes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:06.480
It turns out that Red Donkey used the grenade&nbsp;
launcher at Preacher. The soldiers immediately&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:10.800
shoot Red Donkey then immediately fires at Caesar.&nbsp;
Caesar dodges the bullets while reaching for the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:15.360
grenades. He successfully throws the grenade&nbsp;
at the tanks, blowing the entire place up.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:19.360
Caesar manages to escape through the tunnel.&nbsp;
He finds his way outside and sees the northern&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:23.520
soldiers arriving at the camp, celebrating&nbsp;
their victory. The explosion, however,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:28.480
causes a massive avalanche. This forces the apes&nbsp;
to climb on tall trees to avoid the avalanche.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:32.480
The humans are wiped out before they could&nbsp;
run. Caesar hastily runs towards a tree,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:34.160
and he survives along with the rest of the apes.

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:38.400
The war finally ends, and the apes travel&nbsp;
peacefully towards their new home and finally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:42.080
arrive at a beautiful savanna. The apes’&nbsp;
celebration is cut short when they realize&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:46.160
that Caesar’s wound did not recover, causing him&nbsp;
to lose a lot of blood throughout the journey.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:48.880
Maurice notices this, but Caesar&nbsp;
tells Maurice not to worry.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:53.360
Caesar further tells him that they are finally at&nbsp;
peace and can go on even without his leadership.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:56.720
Maurice starts tearing up and speaks for the&nbsp;
first time, reassuring Caesar that he will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:56.720 --> 00:16:01.120
preserve his legacy for his son. Caesar smiles&nbsp;
and looks at his tribe once more before drawing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:05.120
his last breath and finally rests, knowing&nbsp;
that his tribe, the apes, are finally safe.
