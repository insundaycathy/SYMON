00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.400
Story Recapped here. Today, I'm going to&nbsp;
explain a Sci-Fi film called "Hollow Man."&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.200
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.920
Inside a military-sanctioned research lab,&nbsp;
a rat inadvertently scurries into a cage in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.240
search of food and water, but instead of finding&nbsp;
sustenance, it becomes prey to an unseen predator.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.920
The invisible beast only becomes perceptible&nbsp;
when the rat's blood taints its sharp fangs.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.760
Elsewhere, Dr. Sebastian Caine works overtime&nbsp;
in his apartment to develop a formula to reverse&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.920
a procedure that turns a subject invisible.&nbsp;
He stops for a while to admire his alluring&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.840
neighbor in the next building as she changes&nbsp;
her clothes. Sebastian's anticipation of seeing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.600
her undress turns to disappointment when the&nbsp;
woman shuts the blinds on her bedroom window.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.360
As he paces around the apartment, he suddenly&nbsp;
comes up with a breakthrough, so he immediately&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.600
tests it on the computer. Not long, he calls&nbsp;
his colleague and ex-girlfriend Linda McKay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.360
to report his success. During a video call, he&nbsp;
notices a man on Linda's bed and asks who it is,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.640
but Linda turns the camera away from the&nbsp;
bed, noting that her love life is no longer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.800
Sebastian's business. After showing Linda the&nbsp;
breakthrough formula, he asks her to call their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.680
colleague Matt Kensington to prepare the gorilla&nbsp;
Isabelle so that they could conduct a live test.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.200
After dropping the call, Linda wakes up Matt&nbsp;
and tells him that they have to go to the lab&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.200
immediately because Sebastian finally cracked the&nbsp;
reversal formula. Linda tells him that they should&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.280
go in separate cars to keep their relationship a&nbsp;
secret from Sebastian. Matt hints that they will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.800
have to let Sebastian know at some point, so&nbsp;
Linda assures him that she will do it someday.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.360
Upon their arrival, Matt goes straight to&nbsp;
Isabelle's cage to sedate the invisible gorilla,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.600
but before he could inject her with the solution,&nbsp;
the animal scratches him and runs out of the cage.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.560
As Matt chases the ape, he runs into Sebastian in&nbsp;
the hallway. After grabbing a tranquilizer gun,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.720
Sebastian initiates a $10 wager, saying&nbsp;
he'll be the one to get Isabelle first.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.080
With the gorilla cornered, Matt shoots&nbsp;
her with the tranquilizer, but he misses.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.560
Sebastian immediately follows up with one shot&nbsp;
and hits the ape, knocking her unconscious.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.480
Dr. Sarah Kennedy, the lab veterinarian, suddenly&nbsp;
barges in and confronts Sebastian about injecting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.560
the new formula into Isabelle without even&nbsp;
testing it. Sebastian argues that skipping the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.800
tests will save them time. Linda interrupts their&nbsp;
argument to tell Sebastian that the lab is ready.

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.800
After checking Isabelle's vitals, Sarah&nbsp;
sprays the gorilla's arms with a dye and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.560
taps it to prepare for the injection. As Matt&nbsp;
prepares to inject Isabelle with the serum,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.040
Sebastian grabs the syringe from Matt, saying&nbsp;
the honor should go to him. Soon after injection,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.080
the serum travels through the ape's&nbsp;
veins and makes its way to the heart.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.840
The research team watches in amazement as&nbsp;
Isabelle's vital organs become visible.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.240
However, the gorilla starts thrashing around in&nbsp;
pain as her blood pressure and heart rate rise.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.160
Soon the ape starts going through cardiac arrest&nbsp;
and eventually flatlines, so Linda hits her with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.880
the defibrillator several times. Sebastian asks&nbsp;
Matt to administer an intracardiac injection after&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.200
getting no response, but before Matt could inject&nbsp;
the gorilla, her heart starts beating again.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.400
As her condition stabilizes,&nbsp;
Isabelle's body slowly becomes visible.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.560
The research team celebrates their success&nbsp;
by dining in an upscale restaurant.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.240
During a moment alone with Linda, Sebastian&nbsp;
reminisces about their failed relationship and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:50.080
hints that he wants to get back together with&nbsp;
her. However, his hopes of rekindling their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.360
relationship are soon dashed when he notices&nbsp;
her pulling back when he tries to kiss her.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.080
Days later, Sebastian meets with an oversight&nbsp;
committee at the Pentagon to report his findings.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.000
But Linda and Matt are surprised to hear Sebastian&nbsp;
telling them that he was unsuccessful at reversing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.320
the procedure. Sebastian tells the committee that&nbsp;
the research team is close to finding a solution,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.960
but they still need more time. Dr. Howard&nbsp;
Kramer, Sebastian's former teacher,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:14.640
praises his ingenuity and determination, but&nbsp;
he warns Sebastian that the government can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.960
easily replace him if he doesn't&nbsp;
show them any results soon.

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.040
Sebastian tells Linda and Matt that he wasn't&nbsp;
ready to let the military know about their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.640
success, fearing that the government will take&nbsp;
over the project once they report their findings.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.880
Sebastian suggests conducting a test on&nbsp;
humans without letting the government know.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.080
Matt reminds him that there are rules&nbsp;
and procedures, but Sebastian argues that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.600
following the rules will get them nowhere.&nbsp;
Sebastian assures them that they will have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.960
a better chance of winning the Nobel Prize&nbsp;
by taking the project into their own hands.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.880
When they get back to the lab, Sebastian&nbsp;
tells the rest of the team that they got the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.120
clearance to go ahead with human testing because&nbsp;
he volunteered. Sensing the team's apprehensions,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.360
Sebastian reminds them that they had successfully&nbsp;
brought back seven apes in the past four weeks.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.840
He stresses that human testing&nbsp;
would be the next logical step&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.040
if they want to keep the project going.&nbsp;
Once they go through with the procedure,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.080
Sebastian will stay invisible for three&nbsp;
days before performing the reversal.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.800
On the day of the procedure, Matt tells Sebastian&nbsp;
that he can still back out, but Sebastian is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.560
determined to be the first human test subject&nbsp;
for his experiment. On the operating table,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.400
Sebastian takes the serum from Linda, saying&nbsp;
he'll inject himself so Linda won't be blamed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.720
if anything goes wrong. Soon after shooting the&nbsp;
serum into his vein, Sebastian starts feeling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.200
a tingle in his arm. He suddenly starts thrashing&nbsp;
around from the pain as his skin starts to vanish.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.240
Seeing his unstable heart rate, Carter&nbsp;
Abbey, the emergency medical technician,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.400
immediately brings the defibrillator beside the&nbsp;
operating table. But before they could shock him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.120
his heart rate begins to stabilize&nbsp;
even as he writhes from the pain.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.040
Soon, Sebastian loses consciousness&nbsp;
while his body slowly turns invisible.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.840
After 17 hours, Sebastian finally wakes&nbsp;
up. Overwhelmed by the brightness,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.160
Sebastian tells Linda to turn off the lights,&nbsp;
noting that he can't shut his eyelids. Linda&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.920
points out that Sebastian can still see when&nbsp;
he shuts them because they are now transparent.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:53.600
Sebastian immediately walks to a mirror to&nbsp;
see if he has really turned invisible. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:57.200
then walks with Matt and Linda to the lab to let&nbsp;
the rest of the team marvel at his invisibility.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.800
Later on, Linda informs Sebastian&nbsp;
that one of the team members will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.080
be staying with him if he needs anything.&nbsp;
The rest of the team will be on alert so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.280
that they could run back to the lab&nbsp;
within 30 minutes. Before leaving,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.720
Linda tells Sarah that Carter will come by at six&nbsp;
in the morning while she will be back by eight.

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:15.440
While Sarah sleeps, Sebastian approaches her and&nbsp;
caresses her hair, trying to find out if she's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:20.640
awake. Not long, Sebastian starts unbuttoning her&nbsp;
shirt and touches her inappropriately. When Sarah&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:25.040
wakes up, she notices her unbuttoned shirt, so&nbsp;
she asks Sebastian if he's in the room with her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:29.040
When she looks at the monitor, Sebastian is&nbsp;
not in his bed, but he gets back and lies down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:33.280
as soon as Sarah turns around. The following&nbsp;
morning, Sarah tells Linda and Matt about her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:37.440
suspicion that Sebastian had done something to&nbsp;
her while she was asleep. However, Sarah tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:41.280
them not to confront Sebastian because she is&nbsp;
still not sure if anything happened. When Matt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:45.200
asks Sebastian about his absence from his room,&nbsp;
Sebastian explains that he went out to get coffee.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.400
Three days after the procedure, the team prepares&nbsp;
Sebastian for the reversal. After Matt injects&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:54.000
him with the serum, Sebastian starts breathing&nbsp;
heavily, telling them that something is wrong.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:58.640
Soon, he thrashes around the table and breaks free&nbsp;
from the straps, so Matt and Carter hold him down.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:03.440
However, Sebastian still manages to get up from&nbsp;
the table after throwing Carter across the room&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:06.800
and kicking Matt in the face. His body&nbsp;
becomes visible for a moment, but he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.720
drops to the ground and becomes unconscious.&nbsp;
By the time they bring him back to the table,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:14.320
Linda discovers that Sebastian no longer&nbsp;
has a pulse, so Matt performs C.P.R. on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:18.480
him. His pulse eventually returns, and&nbsp;
his body slowly becomes invisible again.

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:22.000
When Sebastian wakes up hours later,&nbsp;
Linda tells him that he almost died.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.600
Sebastian tells Linda that he needs to make some&nbsp;
adjustments if he's going to remain invisible,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:30.320
so they make a latex mask to make him visible as&nbsp;
he walks around the lab. Over the next few days,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:34.320
Matt desperately tries to figure out how to&nbsp;
reverse the procedure without killing Sebastian.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:38.080
After ten days of invisibility, Sebastian&nbsp;
becomes frustrated from undergoing several&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:42.000
tests and being confined to the lab. One&nbsp;
night, he decides to go out when Carter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.600
is the only one at the lab watching&nbsp;
over him. Failing to stop Sebastian,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:48.960
Carter immediately calls the other team members&nbsp;
to alert them about Sebastian's departure.

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:53.440
While driving on the road, he decides to have&nbsp;
fun with two kids in a car by showing them his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:58.000
empty eye sockets. Linda asks Matt to go to the&nbsp;
lab while she checks out Sebastian's apartment.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.160
When Sebastian gets home, he notices his neighbor&nbsp;
at the next building changing her clothes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.600
He hesitantly decides to take advantage of his&nbsp;
invisibility and go to the next building to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:09.840
see the woman up close. Sebastian rings the bell&nbsp;
several times until the woman opens the door and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:14.560
comes out of the room. When she gets back inside,&nbsp;
Sebastian observes the woman combing her hair.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:18.640
He then moves the mirror several times, causing&nbsp;
the woman to look around the room in a panic.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:21.600
As she turns away from him, Sebastian&nbsp;
starts forcing himself on her.

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:26.080
Linda soon arrives at Sebastian's apartment&nbsp;
and finds his mask and clothes on the bed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:29.040
After having his way with his neighbor,&nbsp;
Sebastian looks out the window and sees&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:32.720
Linda in his apartment. He waits until&nbsp;
Linda leaves before returning to his home.

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:37.920
Back at the lab, Frank Chase, the lab&nbsp;
technician, hands out tranquilizer guns&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:41.280
to the rest of the research team as they&nbsp;
prepare to look for Sebastian outside.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:44.480
Sebastian soon arrives and tells them that&nbsp;
he only went home to pick up a few things.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:48.880
Linda tells him that she'll go straight to the&nbsp;
committee if he tries leaving the lab again. Linda&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:52.880
tells Matt about her concern that the invisibility&nbsp;
has now started to affect Sebastian's mind because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:57.120
he has been invisible far longer than the animals.&nbsp;
While Carter performs some physical tests on him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:00.480
Sebastian confesses that he messed with a&nbsp;
woman while he was outside, and he liked it.

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:05.040
A few days later, Matt calls Linda to tell&nbsp;
her that he had a breakthrough. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:09.840
the process breaks down during a simulation at the&nbsp;
lab. Sebastian expresses his frustration to Linda&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:14.000
that he cannot take advantage of his invisibility,&nbsp;
adding that he has become a prisoner at the lab.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.720
When Linda tells him that he's not a&nbsp;
prisoner, Sebastian points out that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:19.760
Linda can freely go outside and be with&nbsp;
her boyfriend while he's stuck in the lab.

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:23.920
Later that night, Sebastian grabs a piece of&nbsp;
electronic equipment at the lab and installs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:27.680
it in the camera inside his room to run a&nbsp;
video loop of himself sleeping on the bed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:31.040
He decides to visit Linda's apartment and&nbsp;
finds out that she's been dating Matt.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:35.040
As Matt and Linda begin to make love, Sebastian&nbsp;
breaks the window next to the bed, interrupting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:39.840
them. Linda calls the lab to find out if Sebastian&nbsp;
has escaped, but Frank tells her that he's in bed.

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:44.800
Sebastian goes back to the lab, enraged with&nbsp;
jealousy. While pacing around the facility,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:46.960
he gets annoyed by the&nbsp;
barking of the invisible dog,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:50.000
so he grabs it and slams it on the&nbsp;
walls of the cage until it dies.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000
When Sarah confronts Sebastian about the dead&nbsp;
animal, he claims to be asleep when it died.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.760
After going through the video security footage,&nbsp;
they conclude that Sebastian never left the room.

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:02.640
While Linda is working at home, she's suddenly&nbsp;
disturbed when she hears noises all over the room,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:06.720
so she runs to the lab to see if Sebastian's&nbsp;
there. Linda sees him lying in bed on the video&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:10.400
monitor, but she doesn't find him in his&nbsp;
room. She realizes that he's been running&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:14.080
a video loop of himself in bed, so she calls&nbsp;
everyone in the team to get back to the lab.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:18.400
Meanwhile, Sebastian walks around the parking&nbsp;
lot, observing the research team as they arrive.

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:22.800
Matt and Linda visit Dr. Kramer to report&nbsp;
Sebastian, but unbeknownst to them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:26.400
Sebastian followed them there. After&nbsp;
they leave, Sebastian attacks Dr.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:30.000
Kramer by the pool and drowns him. Dr.&nbsp;
Kramer calls out to his wife for help,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.960
but by the time she gets to the&nbsp;
pool, Dr. Kramer is already dead.

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:37.040
When Linda arrives at the lab the next&nbsp;
day, she tries to call Dr. Kramer,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:40.800
but she finds out that he drowned in the pool&nbsp;
the previous night. She tries calling another&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:44.160
member of the oversight committee, but&nbsp;
the phone lines are suddenly disconnected.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:47.840
Matt and Linda try to leave the lab, but the&nbsp;
security system won't let them use the elevator.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:51.920
Soon, the research team learns that their&nbsp;
access codes inside the lab have been revoked.

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:57.520
As the team starts searching for Sebastian, Janice&nbsp;
Walton, the lab tech, falls behind while she grabs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:01.680
a thermal goggle. Sebastian suddenly appears at&nbsp;
the door and strangles her with an I.V. line.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:05.920
She screams, but her voice is drowned out by the&nbsp;
noise of the screeching animals in their cages.

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:10.320
Failing to find Kramer, Linda uses the intercom&nbsp;
to tell Sebastian that the committee already&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:13.920
knows what he did. But Sebastian reveals&nbsp;
that he killed Kramer the previous night&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:17.600
before he could tell anyone about him.&nbsp;
Soon, the team realizes that Janice is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:22.160
missing. Using their thermal goggles, they&nbsp;
discover her lifeless body inside a locker.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:25.760
Linda asks Frank to restore their access codes&nbsp;
so that they can activate motion detectors.

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:28.960
When they see someone moving through the&nbsp;
corridors, Matt and Carter arm themselves&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:33.040
with tranquilizer guns to find Sebastian as&nbsp;
Linda guides them. Carter sees heat signatures&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:36.240
behind the pipes, but Matt discovers&nbsp;
that the heat is coming from the vent.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:40.000
While Matt is not looking, Sebastian grabs&nbsp;
Carter while hiding on a ceiling pipe.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.080
Matt shoots him, but he misses and hits a&nbsp;
pipe instead. As Matt continues to shoot,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:48.400
Sebastian flings Carter toward the wall. Carter&nbsp;
hits the corner of a metal box by the pipes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:50.640
cutting a major artery and&nbsp;
causing massive blood loss.

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:54.080
Sebastian surrounds himself with&nbsp;
heat emanating from the pipes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:58.560
rendering Matt's thermal goggles useless. After&nbsp;
running out of tranquilizers, Matt grabs a fire&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:02.400
extinguisher to use it against Sebastian.&nbsp;
With the smoke from the fire extinguisher,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:06.480
Matt is able to see Sebastian, but he still&nbsp;
struggles to hit him. Sebastian knocks Matt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:09.600
to the ground with a punch and a kick,&nbsp;
but Linda arrives to take him to safety.

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:13.760
Sarah learns that Carter has lost a lot of&nbsp;
blood, so she grabs several bags of blood&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:17.840
from the walk-in fridge. Before she could&nbsp;
get back to Carter, Sebastian locks her in,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:22.320
so she splashes the blood all over the floor to&nbsp;
see Sebastian's footsteps. She manages to douse&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:26.320
Sebastian with blood, but Sebastian tackles&nbsp;
her and shoots her with the tranquilizer gun.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:30.480
Not content with knocking Sarah unconscious,&nbsp;
Sebastian breaks her neck, killing her instantly.

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:34.880
Carter soon dies from severe blood loss&nbsp;
while Frank waits for Sarah to get back.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:38.480
Frank leaves Carter's dead body behind and&nbsp;
goes with Matt and Linda to find Sarah.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:42.640
When they discover her body in the walk-in fridge,&nbsp;
Sebastian emerges and stabs Frank with a crowbar.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:47.360
Afterward, Sebastian stabs Matt with a metal bar&nbsp;
in the lower chest and locks him and Linda inside&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:51.360
the fridge. Sebastian goes back to his room&nbsp;
to wear his mask and prepare to leave the lab.

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:55.680
Linda patches up Matt's wound with duct tape&nbsp;
and escapes from the fridge using a magnetized&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:55.680 --> 00:12:00.080
metal drawer handle. She then drags Matt out of&nbsp;
the freezer and lights a fire to warm him up.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:03.120
Meanwhile, Sebastian gathers up some&nbsp;
chemicals to create an explosive to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:06.160
blow up the lab and cover up his&nbsp;
crimes. He puts the chemicals in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:09.760
a centrifuge and sets the timer for five&nbsp;
minutes before heading to the elevator.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:14.320
Upon reaching the lift, Linda stops him and sets&nbsp;
him ablaze with a flamethrower. She slides down to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:18.080
the floor to stop the elevator doors from closing&nbsp;
and continues shooting flames at Sebastian.

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:22.720
After walking out of the lift, Sebastian slowly&nbsp;
peels away his singed clothes, making him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:27.440
invisible again. Linda uses the remaining fuel&nbsp;
on the flamethrower to activate the sprinklers.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:31.440
Sebastian manages to sneak up on her and subdue&nbsp;
her, but Matt comes to her rescue, knocking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:36.080
Sebastian out with a crowbar. Sebastian tries to&nbsp;
hit Matt with the crowbar, but Matt fends him off,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:41.040
causing him to hit a fuse box. As Sebastian gets&nbsp;
electrocuted, his body becomes partially visible.

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:43.840
Matt and Linda discover the makeshift&nbsp;
explosive that Sebastian made,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:47.280
so they run to the elevator in the hopes&nbsp;
of climbing the ladder that leads outside.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:50.880
As they climb up, the makeshift bomb&nbsp;
explodes, sending the elevator upwards,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:55.280
scraping Linda's shoulder. The elevator is then&nbsp;
pulled back down, but it stops just before it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:55.280 --> 00:13:00.160
hits Matt. As they start climbing the ladder&nbsp;
again, Sebastian pulls Linda back down. Linda&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:04.480
and Sebastian fall on the elevator, which is&nbsp;
hanging only by a thick wire. As Linda struggles&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:08.800
to break free, and Sebastian steals one last&nbsp;
kiss, telling her that it's for old time's sake.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:13.280
While they kiss, Linda grabs the wire holding up&nbsp;
the elevator and uses her foot to disconnect it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:17.760
Linda hangs onto the wire as she watches Sebastian&nbsp;
fall to his death down the elevator shaft. Linda&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:21.360
and Matt soon emerge from the burning building&nbsp;
as firefighters scramble to put out the flames.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.920
Before Sebastian turned invisible, the research&nbsp;
team managed to tolerate his arrogance and extreme&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:30.160
competitiveness. More of his bad qualities seemed&nbsp;
to turn up soon after becoming the test subject of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:33.840
his own experiment. He immediately mistreated&nbsp;
Sarah the first night he became invisible.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:38.160
When the reversal procedure failed, he grew&nbsp;
agitated from being confined in the lab,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:41.840
so he decided to break protocol and&nbsp;
leave. With no one to stop him outside,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:44.320
he takes advantage of his invisibility&nbsp;
and assaults his neighbor.

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:48.720
Sebastian's obsession with Linda also grew&nbsp;
out of control throughout the experiment.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:52.560
Although he's not in a relationship with Linda,&nbsp;
he killed an innocent dog in a jealous rage when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:56.720
he discovered her relationship with Matt. Out&nbsp;
of all his bad traits, the deadliest so far&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:01.200
has been his ambition. In an effort to preserve&nbsp;
his career, he killed his mentor Dr. Kramer, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:05.440
he created an elaborate plan to blow up the lab,&nbsp;
with all his colleagues trapped inside, to destroy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:09.520
all the evidence of his crimes. If it wasn't&nbsp;
for Linda and Matt, he might have succeeded.
