00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.440
Story Recapped here. Today I'm going to&nbsp;
show you a 1998 psychological comedy-drama&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:11.360
film called The Truman Show. Spoilers&nbsp;
ahead! Watch out and take careChristof,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.520
the creator of The Truman Show, informs a&nbsp;
documentary that although everything around&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:20.800
Truman is fake, his emotions are genuine, and&nbsp;
his life is still real. Truman Burbank is the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.880
unsuspecting star of the show. His wife, "Meryl",&nbsp;
and best friend "Marlon" support Christof's claim.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.040
Without his knowledge, he is one of the&nbsp;
most prominent personalities in the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:36.560
The crew films his daily life with thousands of&nbsp;
cameras that run 24 hours every day. The broadcast&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:41.840
is worldwide; thus, people from different&nbsp;
countries know of him.Truman is a cheerful man;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.240
he works as an insurance adjustor and lives in a&nbsp;
friendly neighbourhood that is completely designed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:51.360
and controlled by the production team. He does not&nbsp;
realize that Seahaven Island, which he considers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.560
home, is a huge television studio. This means that&nbsp;
Christof and his team can control everything in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:02.320
it. On a typical sunny day, something falls from&nbsp;
the sky. Truman investigates the object and sees&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.960
that it is a piece of lighting equipment for the&nbsp;
show. But, he has no idea about it and goes to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.840
work. To control the situation, the radio says&nbsp;
that it just an object from a broken aircraft.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.600
The production team can also control the news&nbsp;
that Truman listens to from his car. Every aspect&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.160
of his life is in Christof's hands.The whole&nbsp;
set of the show indeed looks like a friendly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:27.040
neighbourhood. Citizens or "actors" have jobs,&nbsp;
have families, and mind their own business.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.880
Truman is entirely clueless that everyone around&nbsp;
him is just actors. At work, he secretly makes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.480
a phone call to Fiji looking for Lauren or Sylvia&nbsp;
Garland. He fails to find her; he browses through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:43.760
a magazine page of a woman's face and rips it&nbsp;
as it resembles Sylvia's eyes. At that moment,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:49.360
his boss, Lawrence, instructs him to visit Wells&nbsp;
Park in Harbor Island to close a client deal.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.280
Truman respectfully declines, claiming&nbsp;
that he has an appointment at the dentist,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.840
but his boss insists that he secure the&nbsp;
deal. Truman arrives at the ferry terminal;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.160
he has second thoughts about continuing to go&nbsp;
when he sees a small boat submerged by the shore,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:08.000
which triggers his phobia of travelling by water,&nbsp;
so he turns back. That night, Truman meets up with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.880
Marlon to have drinks and play mini-golf. Truman&nbsp;
reveals that he wants to quit his job and leave&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.920
the island. He tells his best friend that he has&nbsp;
dreams of moving to Fiji, a small country in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:23.680
South Pacific Ocean. Marlon laughs at him and says&nbsp;
that his idea is ridiculous, as Truman's life is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.680
peaceful in Seahaven. To stop Truman from
discovering his controlled reality,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.600
Christof fabricates scenarios that&nbsp;
dissuade Truman's desire to explore,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.240
such as killing off his so-called father in a&nbsp;
sea storm to instil phobia and by constantly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:41.360
printing messages of and broadcasting the dangers&nbsp;
of travelling. The rain starts to fallâ€”but just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.560
on Truman. As soon as he notices this, the whole&nbsp;
sky opens up, and it starts raining completely.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.000
At home, while soaking wet, Truman introduces his&nbsp;
plan to Meryl, that they could travel the world&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.520
and see new things. She does not think that it is&nbsp;
a good idea, as their finances are not so stable.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.240
Meryl suggests that they should have a baby&nbsp;
instead; that would be adventurous enough. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:07.120
following day, Truman sees what seems to be like&nbsp;
a homeless man who looks exactly like his father.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:13.120
As he starts to recognize him, two bystanders&nbsp;
take the man away. Truman tries to run after them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.240
but the citizens stop him by getting into his way,&nbsp;
making it too late to run to the man. Completely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:23.040
distraught about the situation, Truman comes to&nbsp;
his mother, Angela, to talk about what he saw.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.360
She dismisses the encounter as a vision&nbsp;
stemming from the loss of his father,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:32.720
and he takes comfort in her words. In his&nbsp;
basement, Truman opens a box with his keepsakes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.840
that have pictures of him and his father, along&nbsp;
with other memorable items. Truman unwraps a red&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.160
sweater inside a plastic bag that belonged&nbsp;
to his high school classmate named Lauren.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.160
A flashback reveals that she was supposed&nbsp;
to be just an extra in the show, but she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:51.600
caught Truman's eyes, which made him fall for her&nbsp;
instantly. However, Meryl was the one intended for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:56.800
him. This pushed the show's producers to keep&nbsp;
Truman and Lauren apart as much as possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.200
While Truman danced with Meryl at their prom, he&nbsp;
caught a glimpse of Lauren once again and locked&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:06.240
her in his sight. The producers brought Lauren out&nbsp;
of the set to stop Truman from looking at her. On&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:11.200
a study night, Truman saw Lauren on a table across&nbsp;
from him and approached her, but she told him that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.920
she could not have a conversation with him. Truman&nbsp;
and Lauren managed to go to the beach, where they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.880
had their first kiss. She told him about the&nbsp;
truth, and she also revealed her real name,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:26.560
Sylvia. Truman failed to digest what she said; a&nbsp;
producer of the show who acted as Sylvia's father&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.920
picked her up and took her away. He told Truman&nbsp;
that she was insane, and they will move to Fiji.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:37.600
At that moment, Truman was left confused and&nbsp;
heartbroken. After the flashback, Truman opens&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.840
up a frame of his wife; behind it is a collage&nbsp;
of facial features that he collects to resemble&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:47.360
Sylvia's face. The next day, Truman overhears&nbsp;
the production walkie-talkies on his car radio,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:52.800
describing his exact location. He becomes paranoid&nbsp;
as he feels watched and monitored. Instead of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.200
going to his office, he wanders around the island&nbsp;
to reflect on what seems to be a "controlled"&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:01.280
environment that he lives in. He observes
the traffic, the people around him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.680
and the way they behave. He begins to notice&nbsp;
the strange things that are happening around&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:11.040
him that he never saw before. Buses and other&nbsp;
vehicles stop for him as he crosses the street.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:16.160
Truman realizes that the city somehow revolves&nbsp;
around his life. He enters a building and tries&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:21.280
to get on an elevator furiously but sees an&nbsp;
open wall with producers instead. Confused,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:26.720
Truman is kicked out of the building. He decides&nbsp;
to visit Marlon, who works at a convenience store;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:30.960
upon hearing from Truman and his observations,&nbsp;
he treats him like he is just making things&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.880
up. Marlon assures him that everything is&nbsp;
fine and that no one is following him.At&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:41.040
home, Truman, Meryl, and Angela browse through&nbsp;
their photo albums of Truman when he was young.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:46.240
They reminisce memories from the past. When&nbsp;
it's time for Angela to head home, Meryl assists&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.960
her while Truman continues to look through the&nbsp;
photos. He notices that in their wedding photo,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:56.000
Meryl crossed her fingers when they kissed.&nbsp;
The gesture is a sign of lying or insincerity,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.480
which makes Truman doubt their marriage and&nbsp;
relationship. Because of this, he follows Meryl&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:06.080
to work the following day. After she left, he&nbsp;
rushes to the fake hospital where she works at.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:11.680
This forces Meryl and the other actors to act like&nbsp;
real doctors and stage a simulated surgery. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:16.320
staff manage to stop him, and he decides to leave&nbsp;
a message for his wife that he is going to Fiji.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:21.280
Truman tries several ways to get out of&nbsp;
Seahaven; he goes to a travel agency,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:26.000
but none of the flights is available.&nbsp;
Instead, he gets on a bus to get to Chicago,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.440
but it breaks down before the journey even starts.&nbsp;
Truman's scepticism and hostility grow even more.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.920
Desperate to get out of the city, Truman&nbsp;
convinces to come with him and points out all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:41.840
the strange inconsistencies in his life. On their&nbsp;
impromptu road trip, traffic blocks their descent.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:46.560
They make it to a bridge, but Truman is too scared&nbsp;
of the water; he lets Meryl take the wheel as he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:52.000
accelerates. Implausible emergencies always seem&nbsp;
to block their way. He then runs out of the car&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.080
at a roadblock, but a group of extras knock&nbsp;
him to the ground and return him to his home.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:02.320
Meryl and Truman argue; he accuses her of being&nbsp;
part of the conspiracy. Truman begins to break&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:07.440
down while holding Meryl at knife-point. Hoping to&nbsp;
bring Truman back to a controllable state of mind,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:12.480
Marlon enters the home to "save" Meryl. On the&nbsp;
same night, Marlon gives a heartfelt speech&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:16.800
to Truman, trying to convince him that he is&nbsp;
just paranoid about things and his anxiety is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:23.120
unfounded. However, through an earpiece, Christof&nbsp;
is telling Marlon exactly what to say, including,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:27.760
"I would never lie to you, Truman." Moreover, he&nbsp;
tells him that he is right about his father, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:33.920
he found him for Truman. Dramatically, Truman's&nbsp;
father, Kirk, comes out of the fog to hug him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:37.920
Tearfully, they continue to have a moment&nbsp;
under the guise of having amnesia after&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:41.200
the boating accident, while thousands
of viewers watch in happiness from all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:46.000
around the world. During a televised interview&nbsp;
with Christof, he describes the ways that have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.160
kept "The Truman Show" on air for the&nbsp;
past 29 years without Truman's knowledge.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:55.040
He reveals that Truman got selected from several&nbsp;
unwanted pregnancies, and the corporation adopted&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:55.040 --> 00:08:00.000
him legally. Everything on the show is for sale,&nbsp;
and the actors integrate product advertisements&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.520
regularly. Sylvia interrupts the interview by&nbsp;
telling Christof that he is a manipulative liar.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:10.400
Truman returns to his usual self of being&nbsp;
funny and gets back to his regular routines.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:15.440
The only difference is that he starts sleeping&nbsp;
in the basement after Meryl left. One night, the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:20.080
control team of the show realizes that he secretly&nbsp;
escapes through a makeshift tunnel that he made in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:25.120
his basement.; he escapes their cameras. Christof&nbsp;
turns offthe transmission for the first time in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:31.280
29 years. The viewers are left in shock after&nbsp;
this. Everyone is wondering where Truman went.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:35.680
They organize an Island-wide search where all&nbsp;
the actors come out, and Christof even turns on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:40.480
the daylight to make it easier. In the meantime,&nbsp;
Truman is on a boat in the middle of the ocean&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:46.320
despite his phobia. He decides to overcome his&nbsp;
fear to achieve total freedom. Christof is angered&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:50.480
by this and cooks up a storm to capsize the boat&nbsp;
so that Truman would head back to the island.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:55.360
His plan is ineffective as Truman is strong-willed&nbsp;
to leave the island for good, so he ends the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:55.360 --> 00:09:01.120
storm. Truman continues to sail but reaches the&nbsp;
wall of the dome instead of the open sea. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:06.240
he reaches a staircase which is the exit to the&nbsp;
set. Christof has no choice but to introduce&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:11.040
himself to Truman as a voice from the sky. He&nbsp;
tries to persuade him that the real world is full&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:16.480
of lies, sick, and dangerous. But Truman, sure&nbsp;
of his choice, takes a bow and claims freedom.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:21.840
Defeated, the production team ends the program,&nbsp;
and his viewers look for something else to watch.
