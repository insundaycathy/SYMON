00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.410
Welcome back to Movie Recaps.

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:07.259
Today I will show you a sci-fi drama film
from 2016, titled Arrival.

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:08.490
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.320
Watch out and take care.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.490
As a beautiful view from a lake house is seen,
a woman's voice narrates, lamenting about

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.059
memory and time.

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.970
The same woman, called Louise, is cuddling
with her newborn baby.

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.439
Then she plays cowboys with the child, now
some years older.

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:27.130
She's tucking her daughter in bed as she says
she loves her and in the next moment, she's

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.189
a teenager saying she hates her.

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.270
The two of them are at the doctor and Louise
gets terrible news about her child.

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.460
The daughter dies from cancer.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.019
Louise is walking into a building, still narrating
about the simplicity of linear time, noting

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:44.129
how some days define the bigger story, like
the day the aliens arrived.

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.399
Everyone in the building is grouping around
a screen, but she passes by them.

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:51.999
She walks into her almost empty classroom
and starts the lecture.

00:00:51.999 --> 00:00:56.199
Immediately, phones start buzzing and ringing,
until one of her students asks her to put

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:57.410
on the news.

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:02.030
They are reporting a mysterious object touching
down in Montana, as well as in at least 8

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.110
other countries around the world.

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.880
Alarms start blaring in the classroom and
Louise dismisses the lecture.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.509
Louise continues listening to the news in
her car, the speculation is that the, now,

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:15.479
12 objects are of extraterrestrial origin.

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.020
She arrives in her home by the lakeside, talking
to her mother on the phone about the news.

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.130
Her mother is worried about her.

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:23.979
Louise keeps watching the news.

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:28.270
The objects are seen on the TV, spread across
the world with no obvious link between the

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.350
locations they've landed on.

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.640
Governmental agencies report that they have
protocols for such scenarios, but Louise looks

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.630
unfazed by the situation and falls asleep
in front of the TV.

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.090
Two days later, Louise comes back to an empty
University, so she continues watching the

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:44.759
news from her office.

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.070
As she listens to the reports about the worlds
reaction to the alien crafts, a man walks

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.850
into her office, introducing himself as an
army Colonel.

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.659
Considering her previous experience with the
army intelligence in translating certain things

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:00.829
and her ongoing security clearance, he asks
her to translate something for them again

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:02.950
and puts a recorder on the desk.

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.789
The recording is of a human team trying to
communicate with the aliens.

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:10.690
She's shocked and confused, but the Colonel
persists with questions she can't answer for

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.540
him from an audio file.

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.879
He gets angry and tells her that he can't
take her to Montana.

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:18.580
It's either translating from the file or nothing.

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.000
When she says nothing, he leaves her office.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.700
But, that night Louise is woken up by the
sound of helicopters coming to her house.

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.150
The Colonel is at her door telling her to
pack her bags.

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.790
They leave in a helicopter in the middle of
the night.

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:36.050
Inside, she meets the person she will be working
with, Ian, a theoretical physicist.

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.110
He quotes some of her writing on linguistics
and comments that the cornerstone of civilization

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.400
isn't language, but science.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.110
As day breaks, the helicopter is getting closer
to Montana.

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.159
Louise looks out of the windows and sees the
giant UFO in the distance.

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:54.550
Once they arrive at the army camp, her and
Ian have to go through certain protocols.

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:58.860
On the way to medical, their phones are taken
away and are given special IDs.

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.909
The doctor performs a few tests and gives
them an immunization booster.

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:06.860
After that, they're taken into the main part
of the camp, where links with the other 12

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.420
countries have been established.

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.360
The representative of Australia explains some
kind of situation with the gravity and air

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:17.220
circulation in the vessel, explaining that
they only have 2 hours of air once inside.

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.720
The Colonel comes in and takes the two of
them to their stations, introducing them to

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.220
their teams and explaining the priorities
of the mission.

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.689
Immediately after, they are getting into hazmat
suits and preparing to go inside the ship.

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:33.010
As they approach it, Louise looks as if she's
nauseous and Ian is excited.

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.260
The army vehicles approach the ship that looks
huge from bellow.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:41.300
Ian, Louise, the Colonel and a few others
are taken into the ship with an elevator.

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.550
They go in through an opening at the base,
as they slowly lose radio signal.

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:49.640
The gravity is completely different inside
of the ship and as they start walking up,

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.500
Louise starts feeling sick so the Colonel
pushes her in.

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.530
Ian takes a moment to get accustomed to the
gravity too.

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.680
The team moves toward the window opening to
start the communication.

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.599
Suddenly, the aliens arrive at the window
in a gust of what looks like smoke.

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:06.860
Strange sounds can be heard from the other
side as they appear.

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:11.049
Louise is afraid when she sees the giant heptapod
creatures, but the Colonel expects her to

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:14.359
start translating what seems like noise coming
from the other side.

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:18.570
The team gets back at the base and Louise
is asking if she's fired, as Ian is vomiting

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.040
on the other side.

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.570
The Colonel informs her that she has just
a few hours to figure something out, until

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:25.190
they go back in again.

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:29.410
A few soldiers watch the news, reporting that
the panic around the world has reached another

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:30.460
level.

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.680
Meanwhile agent Halpern is talking to Australia's
team again, telling him that they still have

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:35.920
nothing.

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:40.070
Louise and her team get back inside and this
time she has taken a whiteboard with her.

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:43.890
She writes down the word human and approaches
the creatures, hoping that communication would

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:45.780
be easier in written form.

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.640
Suddenly, the creatures disappear and when
they reappear they start writing back in their

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.030
own language.

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.030
They show her one symbol and then a few more
as well.

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.890
Back at the camp, the Colonel wonders if her
new approach is going to be fast enough and

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:00.510
she convinces him by making up a story about
the Aborigines.

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:05.950
To that, he reminds her what happened to them
when the Europeans colonized the continent.

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:09.970
He also tells her to have a vocabulary list
before the next mission.

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:14.860
Louise goes to the main communications part
of the base, where Ian is talking to a colleague.

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:18.880
Agent Halpern, tells her that China has taken
a completely different approach toward the

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.100
aliens than theirs.

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.940
The Colonel meets up with her and she gives
him her list.

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:26.900
He's not impressed with the simplistic list,
so she explains it to him by writing the most

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:30.520
important question, he needs answered, on
the board.

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:34.300
Louise breaks down the question and what she
needs to know about it, so they could understand

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:35.450
their answer.

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:39.520
The alarm goes off and he tells her to stick
to her list and not add anything.

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:43.590
Once inside, she writes down her name and
the aliens respond with the first symbol,

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:45.390
just slightly altered.

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:48.200
Louise takes of her suit, saying they need
to see her.

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.840
The soldiers panic, but let her do it.

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:53.680
As she approaches the window, so do the aliens.

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:57.360
She touches the window and the alien does
he same, so she shows them her name again

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:59.730
and one of them gives her a new symbol.

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:04.670
Louise thinks she's making progress, so Ian
takes his suit off too and introduces himself.

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:09.520
In return, the aliens give them two more symbols,
which Louise thinks are their names.

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:13.910
The team comes back to the base camp and she
starts feeling sick, suddenly, remembering

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:15.720
something about the child.

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:20.110
Back at medical, the doctor is upset that
she's putting herself in risk by taking off

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:21.110
her suit.

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:24.910
The Colonel and Agent Halpern are prepared
to take that risk considering her progress.

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:30.020
Meanwhile, Captain Marks talks to his wife,
afraid that something might happen to him.

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:34.020
Louise is working on her translation, when
she starts remembering the child again, but

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:35.690
she seems confused.

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:39.620
Some months into the start of the communication
with the aliens, this is what Louise, Ian

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:41.680
and the other experts have learned.

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:46.710
The alien ships emit no waste, gas, radiation,
sound or light.

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:50.520
If the ships communicate with each other,
it's undetectable to humans.

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:54.390
The experts still don't know why the heptopods
landed where they did.

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:56.870
Louise is the only one making some headway.

00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:00.780
She learns that there is no correlation between
what the aliens say and write.

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:04.890
That makes their writing free of time, with
no forward or backward direction.

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:09.180
It takes Louise a month to form a reply to
a simple sentence the aliens write, so getting

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:13.220
to the complex question about the purpose
of them being on Earth would take more time.

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:15.780
Meanwhile, the world is going insane.

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:20.370
The news are reporting violent riots and massive
protests, as a leaked picture of the aliens

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:21.640
goes viral.

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:25.860
Captain Marks and another soldier start listening
to conspiracy theorists online and seem to

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:28.100
have started believing in it.

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:32.120
Louise is working on the translation of the
symbols, when she starts remembering the child

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:33.120
again.

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:37.160
The girl is showing her some drawings she's
made and they're talking about Louise's divorce.

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:40.880
Ian asks her if she's ok, but she can't explain
what's wrong.

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:44.580
The Colonel walks in and asks when she last
checked in with the doctor.

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:48.490
Louise walks outside and remembers tangled
up moments in time with the child, from the

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:51.870
time when she was little up to the point when
she became sick.

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:54.560
Back at the base, she's talking to Ian again.

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:58.230
He's read about a theory which states that
learning another language changes the way

00:07:58.230 --> 00:07:59.230
you think.

00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:01.630
He's curious if she dreams in their language.

00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:05.660
She's scared that Ian thinks she's unfit to
do the job, as she hallucinates a heptopod

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:07.800
standing next to her in the room.

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:10.590
She wakes up the next day and the Colonel
is at the door.

00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:14.520
He asks her to translate a live feed of General
Shang speaking on the phone.

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:18.730
Shang is saying that each of the 12 is offering
advanced technology and that his science team

00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:20.420
is decoding the "sets".

00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:24.580
The Colonel tells Louise that both China and
Russia are mobilizing their forces, about

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:26.120
to start something.

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:29.540
So he tells her that it's time to ask the
aliens the big question.

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:32.669
Louise, Ian and the team are back in the ship.

00:08:32.669 --> 00:08:35.560
She tries to pose the question and formulate
a symbol.

00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:37.130
The alien answers.

00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:41.490
Everyone is waiting for her translation, which
turns out to be "offer weapon".

00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:45.430
Louise and Ian defend the aliens back at the
camp, saying that they don't fully understand

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:47.980
the difference between a weapon and a tool
yet.

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:51.579
The Colonel wants to know how he can understand
their intentions and she says she needs to

00:08:51.579 --> 00:08:53.410
talk to them again.

00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:57.439
Agent Halpern joins Ian and Louise after the
army leaves, saying that he thinks the aliens

00:08:57.439 --> 00:09:02.310
are pitting the humans against each other
and says history is littered with such examples.

00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:06.069
Louise and Ian are left alone in the room,
when an alarm suddenly blares.

00:09:06.069 --> 00:09:10.210
They go to the main communications room, where
agent Halpern is saying that China and Russia

00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:13.410
have gone dark and that he has orders to do
the same.

00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:17.060
Louise doesn't want the communication to stop,
so he tells her to find out what the latest

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:18.420
symbol means.

00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:21.180
All of the other countries break communication
as well.

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:25.420
Meanwhile, the news are reporting that General
Shang has asked for immediate talks in the

00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:29.209
UN, thinking that the aliens are trying to
divide humanity and that something should

00:09:29.209 --> 00:09:30.899
be done about that.

00:09:30.899 --> 00:09:34.829
Captain Marks and another soldier are getting
ready to go inside the ship, taking a package

00:09:34.829 --> 00:09:35.950
with them.

00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:39.710
They're not responding to the radio, as they
are being ordered to stop.

00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:43.040
Once inside, the package is revealed to be
a ticking bomb.

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:45.540
The heptopods notice something is happening.

00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:49.779
As Marks and his team are leaving, Louise
and Ian get on the elevator to go inside the

00:09:49.779 --> 00:09:50.779
ship.

00:09:50.779 --> 00:09:52.860
He tries to stop them, but can't.

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:56.310
Both of them walk inside and immediately start
the communication.

00:09:56.310 --> 00:10:00.250
The Colonel is being informed that Marks isn't
responding and orders security to be sent

00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:01.720
at the ship.

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:05.540
Louise and Ian try to ask the aliens what
"offer weapon" means, and they get a symbol

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:09.769
back, but as it dissipates, one of the aliens
starts tapping on the window.

00:10:09.769 --> 00:10:13.710
Meanwhile, security is approaching the ship
and Marks and the others prepare their weapons

00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:15.180
to hold them off.

00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:18.550
The alien puts his tentacle on the barrier
and Louise thinks it wants her to write on

00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:19.550
it.

00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:23.930
The moment she touches the barrier, visions
of the child start flooding her mind again.

00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:26.650
The alien teaches her how to write in their
language.

00:10:26.650 --> 00:10:31.560
The bomb is ticking down fast and one of the
aliens escapes, while the other keeps on writing.

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:33.949
They hear gunshots outside of the ship.

00:10:33.949 --> 00:10:39.370
As the bomb goes under 10 seconds, the alien
hits the barrier, pushing Louise and Ian back.

00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:43.589
The bomb explodes, but the alien had saved
them by pushing them in another part of the

00:10:43.589 --> 00:10:46.629
ship and closing a hatch between them and
the bomb.

00:10:46.629 --> 00:10:48.850
Louise wakes up in the camp with a concussion.

00:10:48.850 --> 00:10:50.639
Ian is alright as well.

00:10:50.639 --> 00:10:52.910
The doctor tells her about what happened.

00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:56.709
She hears alarms outside and he tells her
that they're preparing to evacuate.

00:10:56.709 --> 00:11:00.291
Ian and the Colonel are looking through the
footage of the last session in the ship, as

00:11:00.291 --> 00:11:02.899
she walks in and says that they shouldn't
leave.

00:11:02.899 --> 00:11:06.629
She thinks they should explain to the aliens
what happened and that as long as the aliens

00:11:06.629 --> 00:11:08.380
stay, so should they.

00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:10.959
Suddenly strange noise is heard from the outside.

00:11:10.959 --> 00:11:14.769
Everyone walks out and see the ship moving
into a different position, but not leaving

00:11:14.769 --> 00:11:15.889
yet.

00:11:15.889 --> 00:11:19.690
Agent Halpern is seen talking to his boss,
who tells him that China is ready to destroy

00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:23.870
their UFO and that they should be ready for
retaliation from the aliens.

00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:28.110
The same can be seen on the news, with the
report that Shang has given the aliens 24

00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:30.920
hours to leave the country or face destruction.

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:33.839
Other countries are thought to be following
China's lead.

00:11:33.839 --> 00:11:37.089
Louise and Ian are going through the footage
from the last session.

00:11:37.089 --> 00:11:40.459
She has another vision about her daughter
who asks about a technical term which she

00:11:40.459 --> 00:11:43.439
can't recall, but then wakes up in the base
again.

00:11:43.439 --> 00:11:45.850
Ian has had a breakthrough with the data.

00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:49.600
His interpretation is that the data shows
only one of twelve pieces.

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:53.490
Both of them present the information on a
meeting with the Colonel and the FBI agent,

00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:57.319
saying that the 12 countries need to work
together to get the full picture.

00:11:57.319 --> 00:12:01.269
Halpern disagrees, saying that the Russians
have killed their top scientist, whose last

00:12:01.269 --> 00:12:04.320
words have included the phrase "many become
one".

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:07.290
Louise thinks that means the same as what
they've learned as well.

00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:11.009
And Ian says that they should offer their
data first, so the others will follow, in

00:12:11.009 --> 00:12:12.749
a non-zero-sum game.

00:12:12.749 --> 00:12:17.290
In another vision, Louise recalls that the
term her daughter asked for was the same one.

00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:21.559
She suddenly has some kind of revelation about
the aliens and abruptly leaves the room.

00:12:21.559 --> 00:12:25.069
Ian follows her and sees that the ship has
sent out a shuttle to pick her up from the

00:12:25.069 --> 00:12:26.269
ground.

00:12:26.269 --> 00:12:29.759
Louise walks inside and as it starts taking
her back to the ship it fills up with some

00:12:29.759 --> 00:12:31.149
kind of gas.

00:12:31.149 --> 00:12:35.020
Suddenly, she's inside the ship, on the other
side of the window.

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:38.720
One of the aliens approaches her and they
start communicating easily, when she asks

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:40.149
about the other one.

00:12:40.149 --> 00:12:42.440
It tells her that the other one is dying.

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:46.319
She says she's sorry and that she needs it
to send a message to the other 12 sites.

00:12:46.319 --> 00:12:50.559
It only replies with "use weapon", but she
doesn't understand what that means and asks

00:12:50.559 --> 00:12:52.579
what their purpose here is again.

00:12:52.579 --> 00:12:56.709
The alien tells her that in 3000 years they
will need humanity's help, so they are here

00:12:56.709 --> 00:12:58.139
to help us now.

00:12:58.139 --> 00:13:01.980
To her question about how they know the future,
images of her daughter appear in her mind

00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:03.339
once again.

00:13:03.339 --> 00:13:07.160
She still doesn't understand and the alien
shows her more of the vision, which is actually

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:08.620
her future.

00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:11.620
Before it leaves, the alien says "weapon opens
time".

00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:15.540
The ship leaves Louise back on the ground
and it moves position again.

00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:18.850
She's met by Ian and the Colonel who tell
her that other countries are doing the same

00:13:18.850 --> 00:13:21.820
as China and that they are evacuating the
camp.

00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:26.699
She continues having visions of her daughter
in the future, who asks about her father again.

00:13:26.699 --> 00:13:30.170
Louise tells her that she told him something
that he wasn't ready to hear, about something

00:13:30.170 --> 00:13:33.060
that will happen related to an untreatable
disease.

00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:35.279
Her father thought Louise made the wrong choice.

00:13:35.279 --> 00:13:38.870
All of the ships around the world start moving,
as the armies from the different countries

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:41.019
are preparing to engage them.

00:13:41.019 --> 00:13:44.350
Louise keeps going back and forth between
the present in the camp and the future with

00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:45.569
her daughter.

00:13:45.569 --> 00:13:49.160
In the future she opens the book she had written
and in the present she's looking at the data

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:50.579
from the aliens.

00:13:50.579 --> 00:13:52.839
The book is about the alien language.

00:13:52.839 --> 00:13:56.740
She has visions of herself teaching it in
the future and recalls it in the present.

00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:59.999
Suddenly, she realizes she can read the data.

00:13:59.999 --> 00:14:01.760
She knows what the weapon is.

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:04.399
And she tells the Colonel that it's actually
a gift.

00:14:04.399 --> 00:14:06.459
The alien language is a gift.

00:14:06.459 --> 00:14:09.970
She explains that when you really learn the
language, you start to think like them, in

00:14:09.970 --> 00:14:11.509
non-linear time.

00:14:11.509 --> 00:14:13.680
The Colonel doesn't want to listen to her.

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:17.449
She has another vision about what will happen
18 months in the future.

00:14:17.449 --> 00:14:21.500
Louise is at an international celebration
and is approached by General Shang.

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:24.279
The only reason he's there is to meet her
in person.

00:14:24.279 --> 00:14:28.029
She has done something incredible, by reaching
him on his private number and changing his

00:14:28.029 --> 00:14:29.839
mind about something.

00:14:29.839 --> 00:14:34.490
Louise says she doesn't know his private number,
so he shows it to her and says now you know.

00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:37.380
She recalls it in the present and runs off
to call the General.

00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:41.500
Meanwhile, agent Halpern is being told that
someone is calling China from the camp from

00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:42.839
his own phone.

00:14:42.839 --> 00:14:45.589
He sends his men to find the person using
it.

00:14:45.589 --> 00:14:49.149
Louise is waiting for the call to be established
and wonders what to say.

00:14:49.149 --> 00:14:52.440
In the future Shang tells her what she said
to him and she repeats it to him over the

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:55.510
phone in the present, running away from Halpern's
men.

00:14:55.510 --> 00:14:58.699
They all surround her, as she tries to reason
with the General.

00:14:58.699 --> 00:15:02.949
Ian shields her as she finishes her conversation,
saying she's got it.

00:15:02.949 --> 00:15:07.149
Later in the present, the news are reporting
on an emergency press conference held by General

00:15:07.149 --> 00:15:11.529
Shang, stating that China is standing down
and will start sharing all of their information

00:15:11.529 --> 00:15:13.119
with the other 12.

00:15:13.119 --> 00:15:17.059
The alien ships from around the world begin
leaving the atmosphere.

00:15:17.059 --> 00:15:20.329
After the aliens leave Earth, her daughter's
story truly begins.

00:15:20.329 --> 00:15:24.079
Ian and Louise become a couple and they have
Hannah together.

00:15:24.079 --> 00:15:27.440
Louise is left with the notion about Hannah's
life and early death.

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:30.820
All of the pieces she had been seeing about
the future come together.

00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:34.949
She decides to have the baby nevertheless.
