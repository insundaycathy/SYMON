00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.460
As hearing a phone ring, the two young girls
lower themselves down the dark shaft to check

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:05.460
on it.

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.880
They discover that the red flowers are mimicking
the sound of the cell phone.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.480
Suddenly, the plants turn hostile and try
to kill the girls.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.650
In panic, they run away from the evil vines,
unsure about the fates.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.210
Will they make it out of the shaft?

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.210
What are those plants?

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:21.560
This is Movie Shortens.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.449
Follow us to get through a movie titled: The
Ruins.

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:25.449
Be aware.

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:26.449
There are spoilers.

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:28.859
Now, let's begin!

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.690
At a resort, two best friends Amy and Stacey,
are on vacation with their boyfriends Jeff

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:34.860
and Eric.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.720
When Amy realizes that she has lost an earring,
a young man named Mathias finds it and returns

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:40.760
it to her.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.489
The five soon befriend and have some drinks
at the pool.

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:47.720
Mathias shares that he needs to find his brother
Heinrich and his girlfriend in an ancient

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:48.720
temple.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.280
They are archaeologists coming to study the
ruins.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.180
He invites the four new friends and they all
in.

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.390
The next morning, they join Mathias’s friend
Dimitri for the trip.

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:02.850
After getting off the bus, the six can’t
find a taxi to take them to the ruins.

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.760
Dimitri pays a local truck driver to take
them there.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.250
As they enter the woods, they find Heinrich's
jeep left there.

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:10.700
They follow a map to get to the ruins.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.750
When they get to a spring, they don’t see
any further path.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.210
There are two Maya kids staring at them from
a distance without talking.

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.979
Mathias notices a bush nearby and it turns
out to be a hidden way leading to the temple.

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.340
Finally, they can reach the ruins.

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.689
While all are delighted with this hidden remains,
the sound of horses and the men shoutings

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:31.700
suddenly come from behind them.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.200
They rush out from the jungle with bows and
arrows.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.230
While the friends try to communicate with
the men, Amy stands in the back with her camera.

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:43.330
Seeing Amy step on the plants, the men instantly
turn aggressive.

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.451
When Dimitri tries to hand over the camera
in a sign of apology for taking photos, he

00:01:47.451 --> 00:01:50.790
is shot in the chest with an arrow, and then
shot in the face.

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.049
Frightened, the friends retreat back from
the men, running up to the top of the ruins.

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:00.570
Strangely enough, the men do not follow them
after, but do not leave the ruins.

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.720
At the top, Mathias finds the tents and a
pulley set up, but there is no sign of his

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.240
brother and his girlfriend.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.060
Jeff suggests waiting until the men leave
so they can get out of the woods.

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.750
Mathias accidentally sees two human legs buried
in the vines.

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.629
He uncovers it and realizes it is Heinrich.

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:20.450
However, his brother is dead with some strange
rashes on his body.

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.190
Mathias bursts into loud wails.

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.420
After a while, Jeff sees there are more and
more people from the tribe coming.

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.260
Jeff thinks Heinrich could die from infection.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.060
Their phones are out of signal when they arrive
here.

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.730
The group decides to wait for the authorities
to rescue them because Dimitri left their

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.730
information at the hotel before the trip.

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.670
Suddenly, they hear a cell phone ringing down
from the shaft.

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.120
The group finds it strange because their phones
can’t work here.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.760
However, Mathias decides to check on it because
he thinks Heinrich’s girlfriend can be down

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:51.760
there.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.940
Mathias then loops a rope around him.

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.920
The other friends lower him slowly down.

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.370
Suddenly the rope snaps and Mathias drops
to the bottom, unsure if he survives.

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:06.610
As the boys repair the rope, Stacey volunteers
to go down the shaft to check on Mathias and

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:07.610
the phone.

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.909
They lower her slowly down, but the rope isn't
long enough to take her all of the way.

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:15.159
Stacey decides to untie herself from the rope
to drop to the dirt floor.

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:17.909
However, she cuts her knee with the broken
lantern.

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:22.050
Mathias says that he is scared, and can't
feel his legs.

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.300
Stacey tells the group his back is broken.

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.830
The friends on the surface decide to make
a back-board to load him up.

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.870
Amy becomes scared and paranoid seeing what
happened.

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.710
She runs down the ground and asks the locals
for help.

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:36.660
However, the men stay rough at her and Jeff.

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.650
Amy gets angry, throwing the leaves to the
people.

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.500
The vines fall to a young boy.

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.269
This makes the man turn violent again.

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:46.520
The boy is shot to death after that.

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.379
Amy and Jeff are shocked and come back up
the top.

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:53.810
The group realize there is something mysterious
with the vines as they all touch it and bad

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:54.810
things happen.

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.250
Now it is Amy's turn to be lowered into the
shaft on the board.

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.370
At the bottom, she and Stacey struggle to
lift Mathias on the backboard.

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.519
Luckily, the trio are lifted to the surface.

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:09.110
While Jeff, a pre-med student, inspects Mathias'
wounds, they all argue about what to do about

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:10.299
their situation.

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:14.930
Later, they decide to rest in the tent, hoping
someone will find them.

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.760
In the morning, Jeff wakes up and hears some
noise from Heinrich’s body.

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.950
Jeff realizes his body has turned to skeleton.

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.820
At the same time, Stacey wakes up screaming.

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.620
She looks down at her leg, and one of the
vines from the ruins is clearly penetrating

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:30.990
into her injury.

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.610
Outside, Amy checks on Mathias.

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:38.500
Sweating and looking pale, Mathias asks Amy
to lift up the blanket because he senses something

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:39.970
is wrong with his legs.

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.780
A bunch of vines has grown over his lower
half.

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.800
They try to remove it the best they can, but
he is severely injured due to the cuts all

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.200
over his skin.

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:52.440
Now the friends realize they are being quarantined
by the tribe due to an evil lurk from the

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:53.770
vines in the ruins.

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.240
The cell phone rings again from the shaft.

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.810
Stacey and Amy once again get down to look
for it.

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:02.630
In the bottom, they begin to look around with
a handmade torch.

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:06.610
As they walk slowly down a hall, they hear
the phone ringing again.

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:10.461
Staying calm to continue with the search,
Amy sees that the inside of the red flower

00:05:10.461 --> 00:05:11.960
is vibrating.

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.640
It turns out all the flowers are actually
recreating the sound of a cell phone ring

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:17.600
by vibrating their stamens.

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.960
The plants suddenly become hostile and chase
the two girls.

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.930
They run to escape from them and luckily get
pulled up out of the shaft just in time.

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:28.210
The two explain what happened in the shaft.

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:31.669
Jeff decides to amputate Mathias’s legs
immediately.

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:35.639
The girls go to the tent, while Jeff heats
up a cast iron in the fire.

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:40.580
Eric is told to hold down Mathias, while Jeff
breaks both leg bones and cuts them off with

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:41.979
a hunting knife they found.

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:46.060
They see the vines retrieve the remaining
flesh that Jeff had cut away.

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:50.270
The vines are clearly carnivorous, and are
waiting for the friends to become their food.

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:54.580
Later, Stacey and Amy go into one of the tents
to sleep while Eric looks out.

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:58.270
Amy can't sleep and talks about Stacy while
sitting next to Eric.

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:02.830
In the tent, Stacy wakes up from sleep with
a clear moan and sigh that she believes came

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:04.729
from Eric and Amy.

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:08.539
Furious, she jumped out and accusing them
of sleeping together.

00:06:08.539 --> 00:06:13.180
Stacey screams at Amy, and when Jeff tries
to explain, Stacey tells him that Amy has

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:14.910
cheated on him before.

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:19.330
While the four friends argue, the vines come
from the ruins and choke Mathias to death.

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:22.819
Jeff runs to his rescue, but is too late.

00:06:22.819 --> 00:06:26.870
In the morning, Amy and Jeff sit next to each
other at the top while the tribe begins to

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:29.160
spread salt to stop the vines.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:32.350
It is clear that something about the vines
scared the Mayans.

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:34.830
Eric calls the two to check on Stacey.

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:37.080
He tells Stacey to show them her back.

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:40.410
She reveals a vine slithers like a snake under
the skin.

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:43.430
The group decides to cut them off Stacey to
save her.

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:48.000
Jeff cuts a large flesh on her knee, and grabs
the vine that is attempting to go deeper into

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.000
her leg.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.720
Next, Jeff makes a larger cut, pulling out
vines from her back.

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:56.729
Finally, they can take out as much as the
vines in Stacey’s body.

00:06:56.729 --> 00:07:00.460
Later, Stacey insists that she can feel another
one by her bones.

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:04.030
They try to convince her that there isn't
anything else in her body.

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:07.970
All four asleep, Stacey awakens first and
walks out of the tent.

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:11.680
She looks for the hunting knife that they
used to cut out the vines the other day.

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:15.760
Eric wakes up, and all three get out from
the tent to find Stacey.

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:19.849
They see Stacey standing in a pool of her
own blood, slowly cutting herself for the

00:07:19.849 --> 00:07:21.220
deadly vines.

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:25.490
They tell her to give them the knife - but
she is clearly beyond reason.

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:29.349
When Jeff tries to get the knife back, she
cuts him in the palm.

00:07:29.349 --> 00:07:34.290
Eric now tries to get her attention, and she
accidentally stabs the knife into his chest.

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:38.460
Eric falls to the ground and dies from the
knife wound, followed by the vines taking

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:40.310
him as their meal.

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:44.140
Stacey - screaming from the pain and realizing
what she has just done.

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:45.879
Stacey begs Amy to kill her.

00:07:45.879 --> 00:07:49.060
Jeff quietly puts Stacey out of her misery.

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:53.521
Jeff now stains blood on Amy's face and arms,
and explains to her that she must run, while

00:07:53.521 --> 00:07:56.000
he creates a diversion to lure the tribe.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.220
He walks down the steps holding her, presumably
dead, in his arms, and lays her down on the

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:01.220
ground.

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:05.440
He pretends to walk along the edge of the
ruins far enough to buy Amy time.

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:07.840
He then gets shot by arrows and bullets.

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:13.069
Amy gets up suddenly and runs as fast as possible
towards the abandoned Jeep they found earlier.

00:08:13.069 --> 00:08:17.680
Amy, chased by the men, manages to get in
the Jeep and starts the car.

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:22.370
She drives off rapidly down the road to an
unknown fate, and a vine slither appears under

00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:24.650
her right eye.
