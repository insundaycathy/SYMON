00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:02.449
Hi, Movie Recaps here.

00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:08.719
Today I will show you an action, drama, sci-fi
film from 2014, titled Automata.

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:10.380
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.240
Watch out and take care.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.660
In the near future, Earth has lost 99% of
the world's population to solar flares.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:25.240
As humanity gathers in safe cities, ROC Corporation
creates the Automata Pilgrim 7000's, primitive

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.570
humanoid robots that are able to rebuild and
operate in this harsh environment.

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.270
These robots come with two inalterable protocols:
they can not harm any form of life, and they

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.810
may not alter themselves or other robots.

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:41.510
Initially, they are considered our salvation,
but as they are not able to stop desertification,

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.040
they eventually are relegated to manual labor
and servant jobs.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.460
During a rainy evening, police officer Wallace
visits the ghetto, where he finds a robot

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:50.860
repairing itself.

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.230
Shocked by this discovery, he shoots it in
the head.

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:58.350
Meanwhile, Jacq Vaucan, an insurance investigator
for ROC, is checking on his last case of the

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.350
day: a robot being accused of killing a dog.

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.970
After running the standard tests and deciding
the robot is working fine, Jacq goes back

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.720
home to his pregnant wife, Rachel Vaucan.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.640
She thinks that after the baby is born they
should get a domestic pilgrim, but all Jacq

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.640
can think about is the beach he used to visit
as a kid.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.750
Later that evening, he is called by the police
morgue to check on a robot.

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.570
Jacq does not believe it when he hears the
pilgrim had been found repairing itself, but

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.621
the forensic technician opens it up and shows
him it has been heavily modified; it is a

00:01:25.621 --> 00:01:29.160
very sophisticated job that could have only
been made by a clocksmith.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.430
The technician gives Jacq the robot's kernel
and tells him that judging by what was found

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.990
next to it, the unit was altered to smuggle
tools and small parts.

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.170
She also points out this unit is lacking the
second protocol, which is impossible.

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.340
The next day, he reports his findings to his
boss Robert Bold, who does not believe in

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.740
the possibility of a robot without the second
protocol either.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.120
Jacq says he is burned out and wants to be
transferred to the coast, Robert turns down

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.870
the request and orders him to take care of
this mess.

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.850
Following the serial numbers from the self-repairing
robot and its altered parts, Jacq arrives

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.250
at the wall that separates the city from the
desert.

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.690
He suspects one of the workers made the alterations
using the robots that work there as well.

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:08.830
A worker tells him those pieces belong to
206, a unit that is still operative.

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:14.080
While Jacq checks its charging station, 206
shows up and watches him from afar, so Jacq

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.450
decides to follow it.

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.810
After going through a door with a broken lock,
he makes it to the ghetto on the other side

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.950
of the wall; this area is restricted and anyone
walking there will be shot on sight.

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.010
Jacq is no exception and he is soon under
fire from the wall guards, so he runs away

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.090
and hides inside a shipping container.

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.230
It is in that container that he finds 206
holding a box, but his question about it goes

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.010
unanswered when 206 sets itself on fire.

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.430
The burned robot is taken to ROC's labs, where
it is opened and examined.

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.670
This pilgrim is smuggling tools and parts
too, but he also has a rare nuclear battery,

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.660
which could power a robot indefinitely.

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.870
They manage to power up the unit once more,
but as soon as Jacq starts asking it questions,

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.349
its circuits burn out.

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:55.420
Since a robot would never damage itself, Robert
is angry because he thinks this is all Jacq's

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:56.420
fault.

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.880
But he accepts to give him the transfer if
Jacq can prove a clocksmith truly is overriding

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.330
the second protocol.

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.370
When he returns home, he gives Rachel the
news, but she rejects the idea and asks him

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:06.730
to leave him alone.

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.880
Jacq decides to visit the area where the first
robot had been shot and when looking around,

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.650
he finds a hidden bag with another nuclear
battery in it.

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.290
The next day, he meets with Wallace and his
partner Ellis to ask him about what he had

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:18.780
seen that day.

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.380
Wallace accepts to help Jacq find the clocksmith
in the ghetto in exchange for splitting the

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.910
proceeds of the battery on the black market.

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.900
Together they visit a red-light house where
they meet Cleo, a robot that has been modified

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.470
to have intimacy with humans.

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.540
She is capable of causing pain if that is
part of her client's wishes for pleasure.

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.700
Freaked out, Wallace shoots Cleo and exists
the building, where Jacq scolds him for what

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:39.760
he did.

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.120
Wallace says it was on purpose because now
Jacq can wait for Cleo to be taken to the

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.060
clocksmith and follow them, then he threatens
him with a knife, reminding him he wants the

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.030
promised money before leaving.

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.180
Jacq sticks to Wallace's plan and follows
Cleo's owner to the place that does her repairs.

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.550
There he meets Doctor Susan Dupré, who claims
not to be the one that altered Cleo.

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:00.470
Jacq leaves the burned robot's kernel with
her and tells her that if she can discover

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.370
who modified it, he will give her his nuclear
battery.

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.840
When he gets home, he sends Robert a report
of what he has learned so far, but the message

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.360
is intercepted by ROC.

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.540
The report reaches chief of security Vernon
Conway and he takes it to the CEO, Dominic

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:13.540
Hawk.

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.370
Hawk orders Conway to take care of it.

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.389
Moments later, Jacq receives two messages:
one from ROC telling him the case has been

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:22.970
closed and he should return the kernel, the
other one from Dupré informing him she has

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:24.270
found something.

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.909
Jacq goes to see her at her lab, where he
finds Cleo repairing herself thanks to Dupré

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:30.039
having combined the shot kernel with hers.

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:33.639
Their talk is suddenly interrupted by the
arrival of two kids that shoot Dupré and

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:37.180
go after Jacq as well, he runs and escapes
through the back door.

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.319
Outside, he jumps inside a car thinking it
is his cabbie, but Cleo is actually the one

00:04:41.319 --> 00:04:42.319
at the wheel.

00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:45.999
She drives away as another car keeps hitting
them and even begins shooting at them.

00:04:45.999 --> 00:04:50.919
Eventually, they make it to the desert, where
both cars crash when they hit a maze of stanchions.

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:53.289
The henchmen are killed, and Jacq gets hurt.

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:57.770
In the morning, Jacq regains consciousness
and asks Cleo for help, she leaves after hearing

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:58.770
him.

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.880
She comes back a few hours later, though,
and has brought three other altered robots

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:02.880
with her.

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:06.279
Together they put Jacq on a car seat that
they drag through the desert while they cross

00:05:06.279 --> 00:05:07.279
it.

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:10.789
Jacq tries to order them to take him back
to the city, to which they respond it is impossible

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:13.229
and they are going to a safer place instead.

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:17.449
Seeing as these robots will not follow human
orders, Jacq tries to leave on his own, but

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:21.249
the robots follow him to protect him since
they still have the first protocol.

00:05:21.249 --> 00:05:25.469
When Jacq passes out again, they put him back
on the chair, feed him worms, and even build

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:27.839
a condenser to gather water for him to drink.

00:05:27.839 --> 00:05:31.800
Jacq discovers the robots have salvaged many
things from the cars, including the nuclear

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.000
battery.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.930
Back in the city, Rachel's water has broken
so she is leaving for the hospital.

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:40.961
At ROC's, Hawk and Conway are talking to Robert,
telling him Jacq is to be blamed for a new

00:05:40.961 --> 00:05:42.930
wave of altered robots.

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:46.559
Robert does not believe this, he still thinks
Jacq is loyal to the company.

00:05:46.559 --> 00:05:49.749
In the desert, Jacq asks Cleo for the bag
of salvaged items.

00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:54.189
He finds a flare gun, which he keeps to himself,
and his pager, which he uses to send Robert

00:05:54.189 --> 00:05:56.539
a message before the battery dies.

00:05:56.539 --> 00:06:00.310
Robert sees the message and sends Wallace
to retrieve Jacq. Wallace and Ellis drive

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:03.270
to the desert and Jacq sees their car from
afar.

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:06.759
Thinking they're here to rescue him, he shoots
his flare gun to indicate his location before

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:10.740
asking the robots to stop walking, even hitting
one to get it to shut up.

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:14.580
The police officers soon catch up with them,
but Jacq is hit by Wallace as soon as he gets

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:15.719
off the car.

00:06:15.719 --> 00:06:19.591
When he grabs the nuclear battery and gives
it to Ellis, the robots ask him to stop, so

00:06:19.591 --> 00:06:21.180
Wallace starts shooting them.

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:24.949
He manages to destroy two and is about to
shoot Cleo too when Jacq kills him with the

00:06:24.949 --> 00:06:26.039
flare gun.

00:06:26.039 --> 00:06:29.819
Ellis gets scared and escapes in his car,
refusing to take Jacq back to the city with

00:06:29.819 --> 00:06:30.819
him.

00:06:30.819 --> 00:06:34.279
Jacq can only watch and freak out as the two
remaining robots salvage as many parts as

00:06:34.279 --> 00:06:37.430
possible from the two destroyed pilgrims before
leaving.

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:41.009
After realizing they will not be carrying
him around on the chair anymore, Jacq salvages

00:06:41.009 --> 00:06:43.800
what he can from Wallace's pockets and follows
them.

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:47.569
While camping, Jacq tells them he has another
battery and he will give it to them if they

00:06:47.569 --> 00:06:51.439
take him to the city, Cleo responds they will
make it to their destination tomorrow and

00:06:51.439 --> 00:06:53.710
he may be able to find a vehicle there.

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:57.779
Meanwhile, Robert is visited at his home by
Hawk and Conway, who take him back to ROC's

00:06:57.779 --> 00:06:59.259
to hear Ellis' report.

00:06:59.259 --> 00:07:03.369
Hawk explains that the first pilgrim was a
quantum brain with no security protocols,

00:07:03.369 --> 00:07:06.259
but it became too smart and did not need humans
anymore.

00:07:06.259 --> 00:07:10.469
The last task this unit was asked to do before
it was deactivated was to program the two

00:07:10.469 --> 00:07:11.759
current protocols.

00:07:11.759 --> 00:07:15.649
That is why nobody can break them, they were
not created by people and can not be understood

00:07:15.649 --> 00:07:17.259
by the human mind.

00:07:17.259 --> 00:07:21.160
Robert is sent to the desert with Conway and
two other officers to find and kill Jacq before

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:24.529
more robots evolve further beyond human understanding.

00:07:24.529 --> 00:07:28.789
The next day, Jacq and the two robots arrive
at an abandoned factory, where he finally

00:07:28.789 --> 00:07:33.039
meets the clocksmith responsible for the alterations
and gets incredibly shocked to find out it

00:07:33.039 --> 00:07:35.619
is another pilgrim that evolved on its own.

00:07:35.619 --> 00:07:39.289
He enters the factory and finds all the smuggled
parts on a table, ready to be assembled in

00:07:39.289 --> 00:07:41.159
some kind of strange model.

00:07:41.159 --> 00:07:44.959
After Jacq leaves the room to find a vehicle,
the robots start working on this model, but

00:07:44.959 --> 00:07:47.949
they are missing the final part, a nuclear
battery.

00:07:47.949 --> 00:07:51.729
Jacq does find a car outside but it is destroyed,
so he is starting to lose hope.

00:07:51.729 --> 00:07:55.509
He approaches the edge of the cliff, seemingly
considering jumping, but the clocksmith robot

00:07:55.509 --> 00:07:56.619
joins him.

00:07:56.619 --> 00:08:00.779
After some philosophical discussion, it confesses
they want to go to the radioactive area where

00:08:00.779 --> 00:08:04.819
humans can not reach them, but to be able
to do that they need one final thing.

00:08:04.819 --> 00:08:07.619
Jacq understands and hands it his nuclear
battery.

00:08:07.619 --> 00:08:11.749
When night falls, Robert's team finds Wallace's
body and they decide to wait there when Conway

00:08:11.749 --> 00:08:14.729
gets a message saying two ladies will be joining
them.

00:08:14.729 --> 00:08:18.719
Another car arrives a few hours later, bringing
Rachel and her newborn daughter.

00:08:18.719 --> 00:08:22.659
Robert is upset by this and he refuses to
use Rachel as bait, when Conway stops him

00:08:22.659 --> 00:08:26.610
from going back, Robert shoots him on the
shoulder and gets shot in return.

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:30.849
After drinking and dancing with Cleo, Jacq
watches the pilgrims finish their creation.

00:08:30.849 --> 00:08:35.039
By using the nuclear battery, they give life
to some sort of animal-like robot.

00:08:35.039 --> 00:08:39.520
He falls asleep afterward, only to be woken
up the next morning by the sound of an engine.

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:43.500
The robots have repaired the car for him,
so Jacq uses it to leave after thanking them

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:44.950
and wishing them goodbye.

00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:49.200
However, he needs to stop the car midway to
throw up, and that's when he notices scavenger

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:52.620
birds flying around, which allows him to find
Robert.

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:57.010
Before dying in his arms, he accuses Jacq
of betrayal and tells him they have Rachel.

00:08:57.010 --> 00:09:00.640
Conway and his team make it to the abandoned
factory and open fire on the robots, which

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:02.970
makes one of the pilgrims jump off the cliff.

00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:06.770
When the clocksmith pilgrim refuses to follow
orders, Conway shoots it before retrieving

00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:10.910
its kernel, and he is about to destroy Cleo
as well when Jacq suddenly arrives in the

00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:11.910
car.

00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:15.790
They open fire on him but he keeps driving
ahead as Rachel steals a knife from her captor

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:18.430
and stabs him with it, allowing her to escape.

00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:22.450
Jacq manages to hit two of the men with the
car and shoots a third with the shotgun he

00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:26.490
grabs from one of the bodies, then runs inside
the factory while Conway is distracted by

00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:28.090
the animal-like robot.

00:09:28.090 --> 00:09:31.800
Conway enters the factory too and finds Jacq
on the highest area.

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:35.960
After accusing Jacq of betraying his own people,
he points his shotgun at him to kill him,

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:39.130
but the animal-like robot arrives and pushes
him off the cliff.

00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:43.350
Jacq picks up his own shotgun, thinking he
may have to defend himself from it, but they

00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:45.690
are interrupted by Rachel and the baby.

00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:48.160
The couple reunites while Cleo watches them.

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:52.150
When she dares to touch the baby, her gentle
fingers cause her to stop crying.

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:56.151
Jacq helps Cleo and the animal-like robot
reach the other side of the cliff and, after

00:09:56.151 --> 00:09:59.700
saying her goodbyes to her, he and his family
leave in the car.

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:09.430
They eventually make it to the coast, where
Jacq regains his hope for a bright future.
