Welcome back to Movie Recapped.

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.649
Today I will show you a comedy, romance, sport
film from 2006, titled She's the Man.

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:08.740
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:13.719
Watch out and take care.

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:16.440
The movie opens with a group of teenagers
having fun on the beach.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.840
Our protagonist, Viola Hastings, is playing
beach soccer and showing how talented she

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:21.840
is.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.240
After the match is over, her boyfriend Justin
Drayton congratulates her with a kiss and

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.230
tells her she's already a better player than
half his team.

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.390
A few days later, Viola and her soccer team
are at the school grounds, intending to start

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.660
practice, when they discover their team has
been cut out because not enough girls signed

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:36.660
up.

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.160
Since playing soccer in college is her dream,
Viola doesn't accept this and goes to talk

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.750
to the boy's team couch, Pistonek, to ask
him to let the girls try for the boy's team.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.100
Pistonek laughs at first, thinking is a joke,
then refuses, worried about the rivalry match

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.500
against Illyria.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.070
At that moment, the entire team -including
Justin- comes over to know what's going on,

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.489
they also laugh when Pistonek explains.

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.239
He tells the girls that they can't join because
they aren't as fast, strong, and athletic

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.440
as the boys.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.350
Viola asks Justin what he thinks, since he's
team captain, and Justin agrees with his coach.

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.799
This angers Viola, who reminds him of what
he said on the beach about her talent, but

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:11.130
he calls her a liar.

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.450
This causes her to break up with him before
leaving.

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.500
Moments later, Viola is returning home when
she's approached from behind by Monique Valentine,

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.569
who thought she was her twin brother.

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:23.670
Monique dislikes Viola even if she's her boyfriend's
sister, but still asks her to tell her brother

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:24.670
to call her.

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.850
Viola insults her before she leaves.

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.609
When entering the house, her mother Daphne
shows her a surprise: she's bought some dresses

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:34.369
for the debutante party, which Viola has no
interest in going to.

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:38.130
After Daphne refuses to sympathize with her
troubles, Viola goes upstairs to check on

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.639
her brother Sebastian, who is in his room
packing.

00:01:40.639 --> 00:01:44.099
Viola tells him about Monique then wonders
why Sebastian is throwing his bags out the

00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:47.859
window, Sebastian is explaining he's going
to London for two weeks with his band.

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:51.509
Their divorced mom doesn't know this, he'll
be telling her he'll be staying at their dad's,

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.319
so he asks Viola to call his school pretending
to be Daphne and tell them he's sick.

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:59.320
He then leaves through the window, right before
Daphne enters the room to show Viola another

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.320
dress.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.039
When Viola turns down the offer again, Daphne
tells her she may as well be her brother,

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:06.070
which gives Viola an idea.

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.709
Later on, Viola and two of her soccer teammates
go to see Paul, a stylist friend of theirs,

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.150
to ask him to transform her into Sebastian.

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.569
Her plan is to go to Illyria and pretend to
be her brother for two weeks so she can join

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:19.540
the soccer team and beat her ex's team in
the rivalry match.

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.239
Paul is skeptical at first but eventually
gives in to the girls' pleads, so we cut to

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:25.680
a montage of Viola's training to be a boy.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.319
They try on different mustaches, she follows
men around to copy their mannerisms and they

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:31.590
even get her a binder for her chest.

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.370
When the day comes to pull off the plan, Viola
is caught leaving by her mom, so she tells

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.459
her she'll be at her dad's for two weeks.

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:41.099
Daphne doesn't like this idea because she
feels they haven't spent much time together,

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:44.549
so Viola makes her change her mind by telling
her she'll spend time with Monique to learn

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:46.040
to be a debutante.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.230
A few hours later, Viola finally arrives at
Illyria dressed as Sebastian.

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.579
She goes through a bit of panic at first,
but after Paul encourages her by reminding

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:56.239
her of all their training, she enters the
school.

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:59.740
She's overwhelmed by the big amount of people
and stands on campus and, when she makes it

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.830
to the hallway with the boy's rooms, disgusted
by the smell, but she pushes through and gets

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:05.120
to her new room.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.959
There she meets her roommate Duke Orsino,
and the boys from next door, Toby and Andrew

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:11.210
- the three of them are on the soccer team.

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:16.000
Viola starts unpacking and accidentally drops
her tampons, which are seen by the three boys.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.780
When they ask about it, she makes up an excuse
about using the tampons to stop nosebleeds.

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.330
When noon comes, the soccer tryouts start.

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:27.189
When Coach Dinklage announces they'll be doing
"shirts vs skins", Viola tells him she must

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:29.569
be a shirt because she's allergic to the sun.

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:33.500
The practice begins and Viola does very well
at keeping up with the boys, but when tryouts

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.700
are over and the coach announces the strings,
she's only chosen for the second one.

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.150
They all go to the showers afterward, and
Viola is trying to think of an excuse not

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.460
to undress when Dinklage comes in and tells
her she's been called to the principal's office.

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:49.340
Happy to have an out, Viola rushes there and
while waiting for the principal to arrive,

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.069
starts to undo her binder, only to quickly
stop when she realizes the office's drawers

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:54.879
must have her brother's file.

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:59.459
She opens a drawer and starts searching, but
suddenly, Principal Horatio Gold arrives,

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:02.790
causing her to close the drawer in a hurry
and getting her binder stuck inside, now she

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.230
can't move from there.

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.099
Gold doesn't notice, he just moves to stand
there with her and welcome her to the school.

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:11.579
Viola gets a chance to untangle her binder
when Gold opens the drawer himself to find

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:15.590
the file, and he tells her he was once a transfer
student too, so he'll visit her from time

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.150
to time to check on her.

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.520
Once she's dismissed, Viola leaves the office
and accidentally bumps into Olivia Lennox.

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:25.580
Viola apologizes and helps her pick up her
books, and this is seen by a suddenly appearing

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:29.880
Gold, who makes an awkward comment about abstinence
before getting back in his office.

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.180
Without realizing it, Viola slips back into
a girl by asking Olivia about her shoes, but

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.430
she quickly catches on and fixes her voice
to be a dude again.

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.300
After saying her goodbyes to Olivia, she goes
to the cafeteria to have lunch, sitting with

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:42.820
Duke and his friends.

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.740
While chatting about the incoming match against
her old school, Olivia arrives at the cafeteria

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.820
as well, and Viola learns that Duke likes
her, that Olivia recently went through a break-up

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.930
and that one more boy likes her, Malcolm Festes.

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:57.320
Malcolm sits next to Olivia and makes her
uncomfortable, which makes Viola sympathize

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.160
since she's also been vulnerable because of
her break-up.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.060
This demonstration of sensitivity isn't well-received
by the boys and they leave Viola alone at

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:05.240
the table.

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.180
When night falls, Viola goes to the showers,
since they'll be empty at that hour.

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.420
She's just finishing taking her binder off
when Malcolm walks on her and starts scolding

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:16.610
her for not wearing shower shoes, he's interrupted
by Duke stepping in and hitting him with his

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:17.610
towel.

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:21.670
Now there are more guys in the bathroom, Viola
can't have her shower so she just leaves.

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:23.640
We then cut to a cloudy soccer match.

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:27.690
The team isn't doing well so Viola is asked
to step in, but she's wearing a pink filly

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:28.690
dress.

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:31.990
Running is hard and when the time comes where
she has to shoot the ball at Justin's goal,

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:33.330
she falls.

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:36.400
Everyone is laughing at her when suddenly
water is thrown at her face, waking her up

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:37.460
from the dream.

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:41.420
Various students wearing masks and costumes
grab her and the other soccer newbies to put

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:45.060
them through an initiation, which begins by
throwing mud at them and taking their clothes

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:46.060
off.

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:49.930
When Viola hears this, she drops to all fours
and sneaks past them until she reaches and

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:52.980
activates the fire alarm, ending the whole
thing.

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:56.600
The next day, Viola calls Paul to tell him
everyone thinks she's a loser and she can't

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.080
even play soccer, so maybe she should quit.

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:03.360
Paul can't help her with sports, but he tells
her he has an idea to improve her socials.

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:07.230
Later that afternoon, Viola goes to a restaurant
where Paul is hiding at the back and Duke

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:11.010
and the boys are having lunch, but they try
to ignore Viola when she arrives.

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:14.790
The plan starts then: Viola's two soccer buddies
pretend they're her exes and say how much

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:18.620
they miss her in front of everyone, gaining
her the respect she wanted from the boys.

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:22.040
Suddenly, a third unplanned girl arrives:
Monique.

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:26.670
After rudely turning Andrew down, she asks
about Sebastian, the boys point at Viola.

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:30.690
Monique goes after her, so Viola starts running
around the restaurant, finding ways to cover

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:33.980
her face as she gives Monique a big speech
about how they're over.

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:38.210
Humiliated, Monique runs out of the restaurant
as the crowd claps and whoops for Viola, who

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:40.600
is now invited to sit with the boys.

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:44.590
When Viola goes back to school the next day,
everyone pays attention to her now.

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:48.060
She goes to science class, where they have
to draw a name from a bowl to decide who will

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:49.690
be their lab partner.

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:53.320
Duke gets Eunice Bates, who Toby likes, and
Viola gets Olivia.

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:57.090
Duke asks her to trade but they can't because
Viola already said her name aloud.

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:00.710
She moves to sit with Olivia while Malcolm
hovers nearby and admits dissection freaks

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:02.980
her out, which impresses Olivia.

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:06.350
Malcolm cuts in and steals a paper sheet from
Viola, which has some of Sebastian's lyrics

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:07.350
on it.

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:10.630
Olivia rescues the sheet and reads the lyrics,
she loves them.

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:14.650
After class is over, Duke takes Viola aside
to talk to her and offers a deal: if she puts

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:18.190
in a good word for Duke to get Olivia to date
him, Duke will in return help her improve

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:19.620
her soccer skills.

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:24.300
Viola obviously agrees, so we cut to a montage
of Viola's school life the following days:

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:27.950
lots of extra soccer training, working at
the lab with Olivia, and being careful about

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:31.500
not being discovered - that includes pretending
to be in a lot of pain when a soccer ball

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:33.240
hits her on the groin.

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:36.770
Then we cut to Malcolm, who is telling his
tarantula how furious he's about Viola getting

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:38.450
between him and Olivia.

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:42.360
He decides he'll find out why Viola acts so
weird and ruin her reputation before picking

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:44.070
up his pet to take it for a walk.

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:48.260
Meanwhile, Viola is outside, taking a call
from her brother and constantly fixing her

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.330
wig, which is noticed by Gold.

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:53.450
She tells his brother she's taken care of
his school issues and he says she was right

00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:55.840
about Monique, he'll break up with her.

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:59.400
After he tells her his band is doing great,
Viola hangs up and is approached by Gold,

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:01.880
who thinks she's wearing a wig because she's
getting bald.

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:03.640
Viole decides to just play along.

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:07.300
A few hours later, it's time for another science
class.

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:11.250
After Malcolm tells them his tarantula is
lost, Viola tries to convince Olivia to date

00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:13.810
Duke, but Olivia says he isn't her type.

00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:17.260
After admitting they feel very comfortable
with each other, Viola tells Olivia she isn't

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:20.300
her type either, so she insists on her dating
Duke.

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:22.320
Olivia replies she'll consider it.

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:26.100
When Viola returns to the dorms in the evening,
she gives Duke the news, and he's glad but

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:28.850
also nervous because he doesn't know how to
talk to girls.

00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:32.120
Viola pretends to "act like his sister" to
help him practice, and they're having a nice

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:36.390
little chat about cheese when they suddenly
discover Malcolm's tarantula is in the room.

00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:40.290
Both of them scream and jump on the bed, freaking
out non-stop until the tarantula leaves through

00:08:40.290 --> 00:08:41.380
the door.

00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:44.650
Duke asks Viola to never do the girl's voice
again when they're interrupted by a phone

00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:48.530
message from Daphne, reminding Viola of the
carnival happening the next day, which both

00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:49.930
twins must go to.

00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:54.600
Duke, Monique, and Olive are also going to
be there, which adds more stress to Viola's

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:55.600
charade.

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:59.390
The next day, Viola arrives at the carnival
with the boys, Olivia passes by and tells

00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:01.470
them to come see her at the kissing booth.

00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:05.110
When Monique also shows up, Viola ditches
the boys and runs to the bathroom to change

00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:06.750
into her girl clothes.

00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:09.920
She goes to see her mother, who reminds her
she has the next turn at the kissing booth

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:11.610
and asks about Sebastian.

00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:15.490
Viola runs to change again, bumping into Duke
-who thinks he may know her- and then Justin,

00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:19.170
who wants to get back together, but Viola
just slaps him before leaving.

00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:22.780
She enters a whirling game similar to the
teacups, where she gets dizzy but still manages

00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:25.150
to change into her Sebastian costume.

00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:29.100
Monique finds her when she gets off the ride,
so Viola runs and finds Paul and her soccer

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:32.540
teammates, who distract Monique while she
enters a bouncing castle to change into her

00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:33.770
dress again.

00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:37.550
We then cut to the kissing booth, where Duke
is looking forward to kissing Olivia.

00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:40.370
But at that moment, Viola arrives to replace
her.

00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:45.600
Olivia leaves after thinking Viola looks familiar,
and Duke comes forward then, obviously nervous.

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:49.440
His kiss with Viola is a bit awkward at first
but Viola asks for a second one that gains

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:53.770
intensity, only to be interrupted by a jealous
Justin, who exchanges a few words with Duke

00:09:53.770 --> 00:09:55.710
before jumping on him to fight him.

00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:59.370
The boys roll on the grass and Viola goes
after them to try to stop them, they end up

00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:01.590
breaking a popcorn stand in their struggle.

00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:05.190
Viola's mom arrives then to stop the fight
and kick them all out.

00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:08.890
When she returns to the dorms in the evening,
Duke is using one of her tampons in his nose

00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:10.350
as she taught him.

00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:14.300
After he tells her what happened, Viola says
he should forget about Olivia and date "her

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:15.300
sister" instead.

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:19.170
Duke is unsure of this, and freaks out about
the explicit way Viola talks about girls,

00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:23.100
showing his sensitive side, which he doesn't
want Viola to tell anyone about.

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:26.940
We cut to another soccer training montage,
where we learn both Malcolm and Couch Dinklage

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:28.740
have been watching Viola.

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:32.850
After practice, she and Duke are at the gym,
and Duke admits he's considering asking Sebastian's

00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:33.930
sister out.

00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:37.360
They're interrupted by Dinklage, who tells
Viola she's been accepted as first string

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:38.560
for the next match.

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:42.480
Meanwhile, Olivia watches them from afar,
mooning over Viola.

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:46.100
She decides the only way to win her over is
by making her jealous, so she approaches them

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:47.830
and starts flirting with Duke.

00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:51.610
Viola tries to stop them from getting together
but she fails, now Duke and Olivia have a

00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:52.620
date.

00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:55.960
Getting desperate, she runs out of the gym
and goes after Olivia to tell her she thinks

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:58.580
she and Duke may not be a good match after
all.

00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:02.140
Olivia thinks her plan is working, so she
tells Viola to come with Eunice on a double

00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:03.500
date with them.

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:08.170
Later that night, Duke and Olivia are at the
restaurant, and their date is going terribly.

00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:11.960
But when Viola and Eunice join them, Olivia
pretends to be all over Duke and Eunice tries

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:13.340
to do the same with her.

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:17.850
Viola gets uncomfortable so she decides to
leave, Olivia ditches Duke to follow her.

00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:21.300
We suddenly cut to Sebastian in London, who
is calling Monique to tell her he'll be going

00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:23.760
home a day earlier and that they need to talk.

00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:27.040
The next day, Viola assists one of her mom's
social meetings.

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:30.790
Olivia is there too, so Viola glares at her
during the whole meal, displaying a lack of

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:32.050
good manners.

00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:35.810
When Olivia leaves for the bathroom, Viola
follows her and introduces herself properly

00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:38.270
- Olivia remembers her from the kissing booth.

00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:42.910
Viola asks her about Duke, so Olivia confesses
her jealousy plan, making Viola come up with

00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:45.620
a speech to convince her to tell everyone
the truth.

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:49.220
One of the stall doors suddenly opens and
Monique comes out, having heard everything,

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:53.430
and starts a fight with Olivia over Sebastian,
which Viola joins to stop her.

00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:56.550
Once again, they're found and stopped by a
worried mom.

00:11:56.550 --> 00:12:00.680
At school the next day, Malcolm is trying
to convince Gold of Viola's real gender.

00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:04.770
Gold doesn't believe him, but Viola just happens
to walk by at that exact moment, talking on

00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:07.610
the phone about dresses and heels with her
girl's voice.

00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:09.710
This is still not enough for Gold to believe
it.

00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:13.130
Later in the evening, Duke is parking his
bike when he sees Olivia running towards a

00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:17.350
guy to kiss him - he thinks it's Viola, but
in truth, it's the real Sebastian.

00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:21.230
Then we cut to Monique entering her room and
listening to her messages, she finds out Sebastian

00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:22.640
has been in London.

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:26.700
Back to Illyria, Viola is returning to her
dorm, where an angry Duke confronts her about

00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:27.720
the kiss.

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:30.660
Viola doesn't know what he's talking about
but is kicked out anyway.

00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:34.589
Meanwhile, Malcolm is doing research and finding
out the Hastings are twins when she hears

00:12:34.589 --> 00:12:36.630
Sebastian's name being called out in the hallway.

00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:41.100
It's Monique, who is trying to get into her
boyfriend's room to get an explanation.

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:44.900
Duke opens the door and tells her he's not
there, also gives him Viola's phone, which

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:47.940
Monique quickly recognizes isn't Sebastian's.

00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:50.980
Malcolm has heard all this and leaves his
room to approach Monique, who is picking a

00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:52.630
phone call for Viola.

00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:53.690
They know the truth now.

00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:57.830
In the meantime, Viola is sitting outside
and Eunice finds her, inviting her to sleep

00:12:57.830 --> 00:12:59.070
in her room.

00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:02.470
At the same time, the real Sebastian moves
in with Duke.

00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:05.180
Morning comes and it's time to get ready for
the big match.

00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:09.050
While Olivia and Malcolm go to Gold to tell
him about Viola, the real Sebastian is dragged

00:13:09.050 --> 00:13:12.510
to the changing room with the soccer team
because Viola has overslept.

00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:16.180
She runs out of Eunice's room and into the
soccer field, where both her parents are arriving

00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:19.650
after the principal called them - their chat
makes them realize Viola hasn't been living

00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:21.160
with either of them.

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:24.540
The match begins and Sebastian is, obviously,
playing horribly.

00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:28.020
But the game is suddenly interrupted by the
arrival of Gold with Malcolm and Monique,

00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:31.279
who announce the truth behind Sebastian: he's
really a girl.

00:13:31.279 --> 00:13:35.440
In order to prove them wrong, Sebastian lowers
his pants and shows a little too much.

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:39.089
Embarrassed, Gold takes Malcolm away and allows
the game to continue.

00:13:39.089 --> 00:13:42.300
Monique tries to talk to Sebastian, but he
tells her they're over before he's sent to

00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:43.490
the bench by the coach.

00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:48.110
At half-time, Viola drags Sebastian away from
the team and explains the situation to him,

00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:49.839
he lets her trade places.

00:13:49.839 --> 00:13:53.590
After changing into the uniform, Viola asks
the coach to give her a second chance, so

00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:55.830
he accepts to let her play the second half.

00:13:55.830 --> 00:14:00.060
The team continues to have a hard time, however,
because Duke is still angry with her and refuses

00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:01.300
to cooperate.

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:05.140
Viola tries to talk to him but he refuses
to listen, then Justin comes over to confront

00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:06.490
and they start a new fight.

00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:10.160
The coach and the principal stop them, but
when Olivia enters the field to check on her,

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:13.500
Viola realizes she has no choice but to confess
the truth.

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:17.570
As she takes off her wig, she tells everyone
the whole story and Duke that she loves him.

00:14:17.570 --> 00:14:20.780
When asked for more proof, she shows everyone
her bare chest.

00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:23.830
Hearing her apology, Duke accepts to give
her a chance.

00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:27.310
Coach Pistonek tries to stop her from playing,
but Dinklage tells him his school doesn't

00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:28.930
discriminate by gender.

00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:31.950
The game continues then, and Viola plays wonderfully.

00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:35.470
When a foul is committed against her, she
gets the chance to shoot a penalty against

00:14:35.470 --> 00:14:38.180
Justin, and she manages to score thanks to
Duke's teaching.

00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:42.279
Illyria wins the game, and when her parents
come to congratulate her on it, Viola convinces

00:14:42.279 --> 00:14:44.760
them to have dinner all together as a family.

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:48.880
Olivia approaches them next, and Viola properly
introduces her to her brother.

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:52.890
As they leave together, Viola sees Toby finally
confessing and kissing Eunice before turning

00:14:52.890 --> 00:14:54.740
to Duke, who ignores her.

00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:58.730
Much later, Duke is in his room and is suddenly
visited by Sebastian, who leaves a box for

00:14:58.730 --> 00:14:59.730
him.

00:14:59.730 --> 00:15:03.620
Duke opens it and inside there's a big wheel
of cheese and an invitation to Viola's debutante

00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:04.620
ball.

00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:07.940
We then cut to said ball, where Viola is helping
the other girls to get ready but not getting

00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:10.180
ready herself because she's sad over Duke.

00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:14.750
Paul offers himself as her escort, she thanks
him but needs to go out for some air first.

00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:18.320
Night has already fallen when Viola goes for
a walk to the garden, where she sees a shadow

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:21.570
approaching her and thinks it's Duke, but
it's just the gardener.

00:15:21.570 --> 00:15:25.270
She's about to go back inside when the actual
Duke shows up in a tux and confesses he likes

00:15:25.270 --> 00:15:26.360
her too.

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:29.880
Back in the ball, the debutantes are making
their appearances with their dates.

00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:32.630
Monique is with Justin and Olivia with Sebastian.

00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:37.050
When Viola's turn comes, they call her name
and Paul's, but she shows up escorted by Duke.

00:15:37.050 --> 00:15:39.800
They kiss on the stage to everyone's applause.

00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:43.370
The movie ends with Viola and Duke happily
playing soccer together in the same team in

00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:47.209
Viola's school.
