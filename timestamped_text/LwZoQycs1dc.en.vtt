00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.690
Detective Recapped here. Today, I'm going
to explain a Crime-Mystery film called ‘Double

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:08.290
Jeopardy’. Spoilers ahead! Watch out and
take care.

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:11.559
Libby Parsons is a mother who loves nothing
more than spending time with her four-year-old

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:15.759
son, Matty. They like to do things together,
including fishing. Libby teaches her son how

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:19.930
to use a fishing rod, and as she does, she
points to a boat across the sea, the Morning

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:23.560
Star. She tells him that it's the prettiest
boat on the island. Libby also adds that she'll

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.029
someday teach Matty how to sail. According
to Libby, sailing is better than fishing.

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:30.939
She tells Matty that she doesn't want him
to grow up because he'll marry some girl,

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:34.370
and no one will sail with Libby anymore.
At their residence, Nick throws a party that

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.079
most of his friends and co-workers attend.
Two of his colleagues try to talk to him about

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:42.070
work, specifically about Seattle, but he avoids
them as he clearly doesn’t want to talk.

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.680
Meanwhile, Libby's best friend, Angela, hands
Matty over to her and Libby asks if she's

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.310
been carrying Matty around the whole time.
Angela says yes to this, and Libby tells her

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:53.250
that they’re never marrying her off.
As the party continues, Nick sees some of

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.309
his guests admiring one of his paintings.
He overhears their conversation as a guy explains

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:01.210
to his lady friend that one of the paintings
is made by Picasso. Ever the art enthusiast,

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.470
Nick corrects the man, explaining that the
painting is actually made by a German artist

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.510
named Wassily Kandinsky. After that, Nick
goes outside to where most of his guests are

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.080
to make a speech. He thanks everyone for coming,
announcing that the party's purpose is to

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.140
raise money for the Small Frye School. Angela
remarks that Nick is insufferable, and Libby

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.380
agrees with her.

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.200
After the party, Libby, Nick, and Angela are
left at home, and Nick talks about breaking

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.670
some news to Libby. When Libby asks what's
going on, Nick tells her to close her eyes.

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.620
The two playfully dance around, and when Angela
asks Libby what her favorite thing is, Nick

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.950
finally tells her to open her eyes. Libby
does as she's said, and the first thing she

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.300
sees is the Morning Star, smoothly sailing
across the waters. According to Nick, the

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.070
boat's owner is thinking of selling it and
has agreed to lend it to them for the weekend.

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:40.070
Nick adds that if Libby likes it, then he
will buy the boat for her. Libby can't believe

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:41.070
what she's hearing, and she tells Nick that
they can't afford the boat.

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.070
Nonetheless, Nick confidently asks Libby if
money has ever been an issue for them, making

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:43.070
Libby chuckle. Angela offers to take care
of Matty since Libby is worried about him,

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:44.070
promising that they will have a great time.
Still trying to wrap her head around Nick's

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.210
plan, Libby teases her husband that he hates
to sail. Nick only smiles at her, saying that

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.210
he can learn.

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.670
As planned, Nick and Libby take out the boat
with Libby navigating it. When Nick comes

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.580
out of the boat's compartment, he is surprised
that he can't see the land. When Libby asks

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.760
where he wants to go, Nick replies that he
wants to go to bed so they spend the night

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.410
in each other's arms. While in bed, Libby
suggests to Nick that they should go away

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.100
more often and Nick agrees before tenderly
kissing her. A few moments have passed, and

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.050
Libby must have fallen asleep before waking
to a loud, banging sound. Wondering why her

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.410
husband isn't in bed, Libby calls out to Nick.
Just as she does, Libby notices that her clothes

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.410
and hands are all covered with blood.
Frightened, Libby continues calling Nick,

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.020
who’s still nowhere to be found. When Libby
leaves their room, she sees blood painting

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.760
the walls, the floor, and even the stairs
leading to the upper deck. She spots some

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.210
bloody footprints which end by the rails.
If that were Nick’s blood, he might very

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:33.940
well have gone overboard. With a whimper,
Libby continues to search for her husband.

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.510
Eventually, she stumbles upon a knife on the
floor. She picks it up and as if on cue, the

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.770
Coast Guard patrol arrives only to be greeted
by the sight of a confused woman on deck with

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.930
a bloody knife in her hands.
The search for Nick begins, and the local

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.320
media starts to cover their story. Libby's
cop friend, Cutter, coordinates with the authorities

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.300
regarding Nick's case. According to him, the
life preservers are still on board. Cutter

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.600
also adds that the rescuers have already tracked
the wind and currents but they still haven’t

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.510
found any signs of Nick. He adds that the
water temperature that night was too cold,

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.170
implying that her husband couldn't have survived.
Suddenly, Libby starts hyperventilating and

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.319
Cutter holds onto her, trying to calm her
down and make sure she's all right.

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:10.920
One day, as Libby watches her son play by
the shore, Cutter and his fellow policemen

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.600
show up. Libby’s lawyer friend Bobby is
also with them and he informs Libby that an

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.900
inquest was held that morning. Nick has been
officially declared dead. It pains Bobby to

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.780
tell her this but while Nick was considered
to have a wrongful death, the authorities

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.900
have formally charged her with his murder.
Before she can respond, Bobby advises her

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.240
to withhold from making any statements to
the sheriff. Cutter apologises to Libby before

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:33.650
taking out the handcuffs. Libby firmly tells
him not to put them on her in front of Matty.

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.740
Libby is taken to jail, and as she waits,
Bobby arrives to tell her that they've been

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:40.990
denied bail. He asks Libby if Angela can take
care of Matty, and Libby only responds by

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:44.190
nodding. Bobby is preparing to tell Libby
what they can do about her case, but Libby

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.960
cuts him off. She starts telling him about
what could have happened that night. Libby

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:51.390
remembers having some wine before falling
asleep. She says that Nick might have been

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:55.180
trying to cut a snagged line as the knife
was on deck. Libby tearfully adds that the

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.870
boat might have pitched and he ended up cutting
himself. She proposes that he must have tried

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.291
going downstairs to wake her up. When Libby
looks at Bobby, his face is unreadable. He

00:04:03.291 --> 00:04:06.459
holds her hand, assuring her that everything
will be all right.

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:09.490
Returning to what they're supposed to discuss,
Bobby brings up that Nick and Libby bought

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:13.599
life insurance policies four months ago, to
which she is the beneficiary. Libby curtly

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:17.180
replies that she's Nick's wife, so Bobby asks
her if she knows that the policy is worth

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.700
two million dollars. Libby tells Bobby that
Nick wanted to make sure that his wife and

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.220
son would be okay in the event that something
happened to him. Bobby is quick to answer

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.020
that the jury might see this as a motive to
kill Nick. Libby asks him if people are saying

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.870
that she killed Nick for money, and Bobby
answers that nobody's saying that. Libby starts

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.660
to get hysterical, making Bobby lightly raise
his voice.

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.740
Finally, he admits that two of Nick's investors
were suing him for embezzlement. He says that

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.770
Seattle has issued a lien on all of Nick's
real estate properties and her possessions.

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.040
This means that Nick's death will make his
problems disappear behind a corporate shield,

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.900
which will leave Libby with two million dollars.
In court, the prosecution asks the officer

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.490
assigned to Nick's case about the boat's marine
band radio when they inspected it. He says

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.600
that the handset cord was cut, and that they
saw Libby holding a knife as they approached

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.550
the Morning Star. After the officer's statement,
the prosecution shows the court the bloody

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.350
knife from the scene and plays a recording
of Nick's voice. Based on the recording, Nick

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:07.710
was able to call for help. When the operator
asked what his emergency was, he said that

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:11.470
he'd been stabbed and that he was bleeding.
The operator asked for his location, but Nick

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:14.940
wasn't sure, so he just estimated where they
were before he started bawling.

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:18.630
After playing the recording, Prosecutor Halliwell
cross-examines Libby, trying to discredit

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:22.150
what she previously said that somebody must
have come aboard their boat. The prosecutor

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:26.389
mocks Libby by saying that aliens must have
murdered her husband but then takes it back.

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:30.640
Aliens weren't the beneficiary of Nick's life
insurance policy. Bobby, tries to object,

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:35.120
but the judge overrules this. Prosecutor Halliwell
continues her assault on Libby, saying that

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:39.380
Libby must've been sleepwalking when she stabbed
Nick. Finding it hard to contain her emotions,

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:42.430
Libby breaks down, insisting that she didn't
kill her husband and pleading to the jury

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:45.740
to believe her.
After losing the case, Bobby apologises to

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:49.949
Libby, but Libby tells him that it's not his
fault. Once he leaves, Libby turns to Angela,

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:54.190
and asks her to adopt Matty. She refuses,
saying she can't do that to Libby, but Libby

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:57.880
is adamant about it. Libby barely survived
her parents’ house so there’s no way she’ll

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:01.360
put her son there. Libby also adds that Matty
won’t be a problem because Nick’s life

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:05.130
insurance will be transferred to him. After
some convincing, Angela finally agrees and

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:08.810
Libby thanks her best friend profusely. Libby
pulls her son to her lap and tells him that

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:12.330
he’ll be staying with Angela for a while.
She does her best to keep herself from crying

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:15.850
in front of Matty and promises him that once
everything is over, they’ll be together

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:17.860
again.
In prison, Libby meets two inmates who bet

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:21.550
that Libby won't last long and that she might
even kill herself. Libby tells them to stay

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:24.520
away from her, but they say that they heard
about what she did to her husband and that

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:28.440
he probably deserved it. Libby tries to adjust
to her new life, and the frequent visits from

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:32.970
Matty and Angela are the main thing that keeps
her going. Eventually, Matty and Angela stop

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:37.201
visiting, and no matter how much Libby calls
her, she gets no answer. One day, the two

00:06:37.201 --> 00:06:40.710
inmates from before notice that she's alone
and in deep thought, so they approach her,

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:43.020
telling her that they know she's looking for
her friend and son.

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:45.910
Libby says that they disappeared, but one
of them insists that she can figure out how

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:50.090
to find them if she just used her head. By
posing as Angela and calling Matty's school,

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:54.110
Libby is finally able to track down where
Angela is, which is in San Francisco. Libby

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:58.870
immediately calls the number and when Angela
answers, she immediately asks if Matty's okay.

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:02.300
Angela stammers, saying that everything is
fine, but Libby continues questioning her,

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:04.750
asking her what they're doing in San Francisco
and why they suddenly disappeared. Trying

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:07.280
to come up with an excuse, Angela says that
she's just about to call Libby and that they're

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:11.150
planning to see her the following week. Tired
of Angela's excuses, Libby demands to talk

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:15.200
to Matty, and while they talk, Libby hears
Matty call his father. The line suddenly goes

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:17.500
dead, and Libby tries calling them again to
no avail.

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:22.410
One day, one of Libby's new friends, Margaret,
tells her to forget about reopening her case.

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:26.490
She says they take years and most of them
are unsuccessful. Being a former lawyer, Margaret

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:30.889
advises her to do her time instead, then asks
if Libby has ever heard about Double Jeopardy.

00:07:30.889 --> 00:07:34.090
When Libby says no, Margaret explains that
the Double Jeopardy rule provides that no

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:37.990
person may be tried for the same crime twice.
Since the state has already convicted Libby

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:41.960
of killing her husband, it means they can't
convict her of it a second time. It also means

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:44.660
that once Libby gets out, she can track Nick
down and kill him.

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:48.520
Learning about the Double Jeopardy clause,
Libby spends most of her free time in prison,

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:52.580
training and getting strong. After six years,
Libby is paroled due to her good behavior,

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:56.630
but she has to live in a halfway house under
parole officer Travis Lehman's supervision.

00:07:56.630 --> 00:08:00.470
In there, Lehman reminds Libby that the state
has only granted her conditional parole, meaning

00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:04.180
that for the next three years, she needs to
follow all the facility’s rules. He gives

00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:07.300
her a social security card for employment
then tells her that she's not allowed to carry

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:10.990
a weapon of any kind. After informing her
what time the curfew is, Lehman gives Libby

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:15.360
his number, telling her not to lose it. Lastly,
Lehman reminds Libby that violating any of

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:17.539
the rules might result in her imprisonment
again.

00:08:17.539 --> 00:08:20.919
With the help of some random guy in a library,
Libby tries searching for Angela's new address

00:08:20.919 --> 00:08:24.460
on the internet. Unfortunately, there are
more than a thousand Angela Greens in the

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:28.930
search results, making her impossible to find.
One day, a fight breaks between one of the

00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:33.409
parolees and Lehman in the house. After it
was resolved, the other parolees get to talking.

00:08:33.409 --> 00:08:36.319
That's when Libby finds out that Lehman used
to be a law professor who got in an accident

00:08:36.319 --> 00:08:39.909
due to intoxication. His wife and child have
also left him.

00:08:39.909 --> 00:08:44.309
In another attempt to find Angela, Libby talks
to Rebecca, Matty's former headmistress. Libby

00:08:44.309 --> 00:08:48.399
tells her that she's her only hope, but Rebecca
says that she can't help Libby. She also adds

00:08:48.399 --> 00:08:51.740
that Matty hasn't seen her in six years, and
if she suddenly comes back into her son's

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:55.740
life, she’ll just cause him more pain. No
matter how hard Libby pleads with Rebecca,

00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:59.809
the headmistress remains unmoved. That night,
Libby violates her curfew and breaks into

00:08:59.809 --> 00:09:03.959
Matty's old school to get Angela's contact
information. Libby manages to get Angela's

00:09:03.959 --> 00:09:08.570
records, but the cops catch her. Lehman eventually
picks her up. As he delivers Libby back to

00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:12.340
prison aboard a car ferry, he handcuffs her
to the car's handle to get coffee. Thinking

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:15.929
she can escape, Libby drives the vehicle back
and forth, repeatedly hitting a pipe until

00:09:15.929 --> 00:09:19.689
she breaks the handle. Lehman finally sees
what she's doing, but when he gets in the

00:09:19.689 --> 00:09:24.070
car, it falls off the ferry. Lehman is still
able to save Libby, but during the process,

00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:27.449
she gets a hold of his gun and hits him in
the head before finally escaping. Libby then

00:09:27.449 --> 00:09:30.660
visits her mother, who gives her some cash
and even lends Libby her truck.

00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:34.309
At a car dealership, Libby poses as Angela
again and uses her social security number

00:09:34.309 --> 00:09:38.279
to find out where Angela lives. Lehman manages
to track where Libby is going by asking one

00:09:38.279 --> 00:09:42.529
of his parolees to do a search on Angela Green.
Libby drives to Colorado and there she discovers

00:09:42.529 --> 00:09:46.160
from a neighbour that Angela, who's known
there as Angela Ryder, has died in an explosion

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:49.779
four years ago. Libby asks the neighbor about
Matty and the neighbor says that Matty and

00:09:49.779 --> 00:09:53.939
Simon, which is presumably Nick's new identity,
weren't there when it happened. Meanwhile,

00:09:53.939 --> 00:09:57.139
Lehman is only a few steps behind Libby, and
he's able to interview the same person Libby

00:09:57.139 --> 00:10:00.389
has asked about Angela.
After talking to Angela's neighbor, Libby

00:10:00.389 --> 00:10:04.019
searches the internet again for news about
Angela's death. In the picture, she sees a

00:10:04.019 --> 00:10:08.170
painting of Kandinsky that Nick owns. By going
to an art gallery, Libby's able to trace the

00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:11.899
painting to New Orleans. She finds out that
Nick is running a small luxury hotel there

00:10:11.899 --> 00:10:16.079
under his new name, Jonathan Deveraux. Lehman
has only missed her by a few minutes, so he

00:10:16.079 --> 00:10:19.089
asks the art curator what Libby was looking
for in the gallery.

00:10:19.089 --> 00:10:22.279
Libby looks for the hotel Nick is running,
asks for Jonathan Deveraux, then finds out

00:10:22.279 --> 00:10:26.269
that he will be at the Annual Bachelor's Auction.
At the hotel, Libby hears one of the guests'

00:10:26.269 --> 00:10:30.439
personal information and uses that to buy
a dress, saying she'll charge it to her room.

00:10:30.439 --> 00:10:34.380
Lehman, who is also in New Orleans now, coordinates
with the police to find Libby, saying that

00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:37.529
she might kill someone.
At the event, Libby joins the bidding when

00:10:37.529 --> 00:10:41.610
it's Nick's turn to be auctioned and she eventually
wins. When she comes forward to claim her

00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:45.980
prize, Nick is surprised to see her. She humiliates
him in front of everyone by asking for a kiss,

00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:49.620
only to turn away as soon as he’s about
to give her one. As they walk away, Libby

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:52.260
doesn't beat around the bush and threatens
to destroy Nick's life if he doesn't give

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.569
her Matty.
Nick makes the excuse of protecting her and

00:10:54.569 --> 00:10:58.019
Matty by getting the life insurance since
they were going under. He adds that he never

00:10:58.019 --> 00:11:01.959
believed that Libby was going to be convicted
anyway. Nick tries to tell her that his relationship

00:11:01.959 --> 00:11:04.999
with Angela happened later and that it turned
out to be a complete nightmare, but Libby

00:11:04.999 --> 00:11:08.600
doesn't believe him. She even asks if that's
why Nick killed her but he insists that it’s

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:12.869
an accident. Libby is having none of it and
she once again demands that he give her Matty.

00:11:12.869 --> 00:11:16.019
After a heated discussion, Libby sees Lehman
approaching and tells Nick that she'll call

00:11:16.019 --> 00:11:19.879
him the following day. Lehman talks to Nick,
who he thinks is named John Deveraux, and

00:11:19.879 --> 00:11:23.420
asks if he has seen Libby. Lehman tells him
that she believes him to be her husband, but

00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:27.319
Nick pretends to be clueless. Lehman also
informs him that Libby is looking for him,

00:11:27.319 --> 00:11:30.240
so Nick thanks him for his concern, adding
that he'll contact their security.

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:35.209
At a bar, one man recognizes Libby from the
flyers that the cops have been passing around.

00:11:35.209 --> 00:11:38.709
Instead of turning her in, he advises her
to leave immediately and even gives her an

00:11:38.709 --> 00:11:42.449
umbrella. With the cops surrounding the area,
Libby tries to escape again by carefully blending

00:11:42.449 --> 00:11:47.149
with the crowd. Luckily, she's able to hide,
and the cops just let it go. The following

00:11:47.149 --> 00:11:50.720
morning, Lehman meets up with Nick to inform
him that Libby got away.

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:53.829
Spotting the paintings on the wall, Lehman
asks Nick if his kids painted them, but Nick

00:11:53.829 --> 00:11:58.139
says they're made by a great artist named
Kandinsky. After answering the officer's question,

00:11:58.139 --> 00:12:01.759
Nick adds that he has a feeling that Lehman
already knew that. While they're talking,

00:12:01.759 --> 00:12:05.619
Libby calls and tells Nick to bring Matty
to Lafayette cemetery number three. However,

00:12:05.619 --> 00:12:09.149
Nick hires a boy to pretend to be Matty to
lure Libby into a mausoleum.

00:12:09.149 --> 00:12:13.269
In there, Nick attacks her and locks her inside
a coffin. Back at the police station, Lehman

00:12:13.269 --> 00:12:17.309
uses their system to search for Jonathan Deveraux
nothing came up. He then requests the Washington

00:12:17.309 --> 00:12:21.399
State DMV to fax him the driver's license
photograph of Nicholas Parsons.

00:12:21.399 --> 00:12:25.480
Back at the mausoleum, Libby escapes by using
Lehman's gun to shoot the coffin's hinges.

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:28.829
Upon getting the driver's license, Lehman
sees that the man in the photograph is a different

00:12:28.829 --> 00:12:32.410
man from Libby's husband. Feeling that Libby
might go to see Nick, Lehman beats her to

00:12:32.410 --> 00:12:35.699
the hotel and stops her, making Libby break
down.

00:12:35.699 --> 00:12:38.730
Lehman meets up with Nick again and informs
him that after asking the Washington State

00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:42.339
DMV for Nicholas Parson's driver's license
photograph, six different men with that name

00:12:42.339 --> 00:12:46.809
came up. One of them is him, Jonathan Deveraux.
Lehman pretends to ask Nick for a million

00:12:46.809 --> 00:12:50.139
dollars as hush money, but Nick says he can
only give him a hundred thousand at the moment

00:12:50.139 --> 00:12:52.730
before promising that he can provide the rest
tomorrow.

00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:55.660
When Lehman says that Libby is still going
to be a problem, Nick hints that he's already

00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:59.699
killed her. At that moment, Libby enters the
room with a gun in hand. Nick warns her that

00:12:59.699 --> 00:13:03.439
if she shoots him, she'll get the gas chamber.
Libby confidently replies that due to the

00:13:03.439 --> 00:13:07.069
double jeopardy clause, she won't be convicted
of killing him now since she was already convicted

00:13:07.069 --> 00:13:11.249
of that before. Libby asks Nick where Matty
is, and as soon as Nick tells her, she shoots

00:13:11.249 --> 00:13:14.449
the Kandinsky painting behind him. Lehman
then reveals that he's been recording their

00:13:14.449 --> 00:13:17.309
conversation and that he will be charged with
Libby's supposed murder.

00:13:17.309 --> 00:13:20.989
As Lehman and Libby are leaving, Nick shoots
them, hitting Lehman in the shoulder. Though

00:13:20.989 --> 00:13:25.350
he’s injured, Lehman manages to tackle Nick,
but Nick still gets the upper hand. As Nick

00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:29.519
stands and prepares to kill Lehman, Libby
shoots him twice, finally killing him. Libby

00:13:29.519 --> 00:13:33.110
tells Lehman that she's leaving, but Lehman
convinces her to go back with him to Seattle,

00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:37.040
where he will demand a full pardon for her.
At last, Libby goes to Matty's new school,

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:46.129
and even though he's aged six years, Matty
immediately recognizes his mother.
