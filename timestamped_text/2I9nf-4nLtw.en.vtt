00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.520
Story Recapped here. Today,&nbsp;
I’m going to explain an action,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:08.160
drama, sci-fi film called “The Machine.”&nbsp;
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.720
In the not-so-distant future, the Western&nbsp;
nations are in a Cold War against China,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.240
forcing them into the deepest recession&nbsp;
recorded in history. The United Kingdom’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.920
Ministry of Defence is putting all its&nbsp;
resources to support laboratory experiments&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.360
in developing and perfecting an artificial&nbsp;
intelligence cybernetic brain implant for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.800
physically impaired and brain-dead soldiers&nbsp;
to regain their lost functions ― creating the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.040
perfect cyborg soldiers that obey orders without&nbsp;
questions, making them capable ruthless killers.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:37.600
Meanwhile, in the United Kingdom’s military base,&nbsp;
Dr. Vincent McCarthy, a scientist specializing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.680
in artificial brain transmutation, tests the&nbsp;
brain implant fixed on the revived Paul Dawson,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.760
a soldier who was killed in action two years ago.&nbsp;
McCarthy sets up a cognitive test for his subject.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.440
After the test and disappointed with the results,&nbsp;
McCarthy and his colleague argue about his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.240
decision to terminate the subject. Paul takes a&nbsp;
pen and suddenly embraces McCarthy with affection.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.440
Alarmed by Paul’s irrelevant action,&nbsp;
McCarthy commands him to sit.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.280
Paul refuses and stabs him on the chest&nbsp;
instead. Bleeding all over the computer,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.040
McCarthy quickly prompts the system to shut&nbsp;
Paul down, but as he keys in the commands,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.200
Paul is relentlessly stabbing his colleague to her&nbsp;
death. Paul picks up a rifle and as he points it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.840
towards McCarthy, he immediately lowers it down&nbsp;
and apologizes after realizing his mistakes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.120
However, the security team arrives and&nbsp;
immediately shoots Paul on the head.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.320
After a period of healing, McCarthy wakes up&nbsp;
from a nightmare. He fixes himself and dresses&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.480
up to host an interview for aspiring candidates&nbsp;
to aid him in his research. In the interview,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.960
McCarthy throws cognitive questions to the A.I.&nbsp;
being presented to him. However, he ends his day&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.760
unsatisfied and frustrated. On his way home, he&nbsp;
comes across Paul Dawson’s mother, who regularly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.480
stays on the road to the military base entrance,&nbsp;
waiting for her son. At home, McCarthy is looking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:47.760
after his daughter, Mary, who suffers from Rett&nbsp;
Syndrome, a genetic neurological dysfunction that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.280
impairs speech and hand-eye coordination that&nbsp;
includes a symptom of irrelevant hand movements.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.920
In another interview, Ava,&nbsp;
a researcher from Stanford,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.120
demonstrates her latest development on&nbsp;
artificial intelligence as she explains&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.800
how her program integrates information&nbsp;
rather than processing terabytes of data.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.960
She claims that her program relies on actual&nbsp;
experience. McCarthy gives his attention and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.480
asks Ava the sort of experience that her&nbsp;
program is derived from. She then explains&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:14.640
that her program gathers information from their&nbsp;
daily conversations because they chat every day.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.360
Skeptic, McCarthy then starts&nbsp;
to procure tests for ‘Machine,’&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.040
the name of Ava’s A.I. program and begins his&nbsp;
usual routine of asking cognitive questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.560
After the test, McCarthy appreciates Ava&nbsp;
for the beautiful programming; however,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.840
Ava corrects him and alleges that it’s not&nbsp;
programming, but Machine taught itself of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:35.120
the answers. McCarthy then calls for a 10-minute&nbsp;
recess. Feeling disappointed, Ava starts to pack&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.800
her things when McCarthy approaches to ask&nbsp;
her about the configuration of her program.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.360
Acting all clever, Ava bargains that if he grants&nbsp;
her the position, she will tell him. McCarthy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.440
then persuades Ava to continue her research under&nbsp;
his supervision as he elaborates about his access&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.160
to the quantum computer, unlimited funds, and&nbsp;
acquisition of the best robotics team. Ava becomes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.720
suspicious of his proposal and asks McCarthy for&nbsp;
the real deal. McCarthy honestly discloses that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.120
the Ministry of Defence is the one who supports&nbsp;
his project. She then displays her disapproval&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.560
of the idea that her research will be used in&nbsp;
making weapons for the government; however,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.080
McCarthy insists that he is making intelligent&nbsp;
machines, not weapons for the government.

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.600
On her first day of the job, Ava&nbsp;
pulls over for the checkpoint when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.120
Paul Dawson’s mother opens her car and&nbsp;
tells her that the military has her son.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.440
Ava jumps in surprise and points out that she&nbsp;
doesn’t know anything about it. As Mrs. Dawson&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.200
gets hysterical, the military enforcers seize&nbsp;
her, violently pulling her out from Ava’s car.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.280
Ava immediately steps outside and reacts to&nbsp;
the enforcers’ obscenity towards the old woman&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.960
as one of the enforcers immediately restrains&nbsp;
and arrests her due to her unexpected behavior.

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.680
McCarthy bails Ava and sarcastically compliments&nbsp;
her for getting arrested on her first day.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.600
As Ava explains how Paul Dawson’s mother was&nbsp;
severely treated, McCarthy cuts her off by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.640
telling her to ignore her sympathies with&nbsp;
the old woman because she is in a mentally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.800
unsettled disposition. He then tells Ava that&nbsp;
her son was killed two years ago in operation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.160
and that he genuinely feels sorry for her&nbsp;
for not being able to overcome her dilemma.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.440
McCarthy begins to show Ava around, and as they&nbsp;
converse, a female cyborg secretly spies on them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.840
feeding intel to her fellow cyborg comrades.&nbsp;
The assigned cyborg units initiate the security&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.240
procedures as they head to the elevator that leads&nbsp;
to the underground laboratories. As they descend,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:10.240
Ava notices the crested-shape scars on both&nbsp;
guards' heads and asks McCarthy about it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:13.920
McCarthy reveals that the implants go to&nbsp;
the soldiers who had brain trauma injuries.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.560
The implants help restore their vision, mobility,&nbsp;
memory and vastly improves their quality of life.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.160
However, the program’s side effects render&nbsp;
the cyborgs completely mute several months&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.640
after the operation for unknown reasons.&nbsp;
However, in reality, the cyborgs develop a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:29.680
highly efficient method of communication&nbsp;
that they keep secret among themselves.

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.480
Inside the lab, Ava feels excited as&nbsp;
McCarthy introduces his quantum computer.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:40.320
Lurking in the shadows, Thomson, the director of&nbsp;
the Ministry of Defence, is observing Ava closely.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.160
After a while, Thomson introduces&nbsp;
himself and welcomes Ava to the team.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.720
Then the female cyborg that&nbsp;
spied on them earlier, Suri,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.160
steps inside to join. Thomson questions Ava,&nbsp;
showing files that accuse her of assaulting a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.320
police officer during her youth.&nbsp; Ava is about&nbsp;
to state her argument when McCarthy suddenly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.560
interrupts by pointing out that they hired her&nbsp;
for her expertise, not her politics. Thomson&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.920
agrees and changes the subject, telling them that&nbsp;
there is something that he wants to show them.&nbsp;

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:10.000
James, an amputee soldier, sits ready to&nbsp;
test the newly augmented prosthetic arms.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.120
The augmented prosthetic is a bullet&nbsp;
and bomb proof arm made from silk that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.040
can adapt the host’s skin complexion that is&nbsp;
indistinguishable for human hands to touch.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:21.280
Ava asks if they are trying to make the machines&nbsp;
look like more humans. McCarthy then admits that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.800
they are making machines to kill and initiate&nbsp;
public negotiations without intimidating the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:28.960
human populace with their appearances. As Ava&nbsp;
shows her astonishment at the new product,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:33.280
James demonstrates the superhuman strength of&nbsp;
his newly installed prosthetic arms. He suddenly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:37.200
requests to touch Ava’s hand so he can have the&nbsp;
pleasure of feeling another human’s skin again.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:41.680
However, McCarthy quickly objects that the carbon&nbsp;
fiber muscles are powerful to break her hand.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:46.400
Despite his warning, Ava fulfills James’s request&nbsp;
and eagerly gives her hand for James to hold.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:51.040
He gladly takes her hand as he gently feels it.&nbsp;
Then suddenly, he leads Ava into a turn, moving&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:55.040
her away from Thomson and McCarthy and whispers&nbsp;
help to Ava and secretly mentions ‘Area 6.’

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:00.080
The next day, McCarthy maps Ava’s brain in the&nbsp;
quantum computer. McCarthy begins to ask her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:04.400
random questions to get her brain data. As the&nbsp;
questions become more personal, Ava shares her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.560
memory about her father when she was a child, and&nbsp;
in return, McCarthy tells her how she is similar&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:12.800
to his daughter about liking computers. Ava&nbsp;
suddenly changes the topic and asks him about Area&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:17.040
6. He describes that the place is where wounded&nbsp;
soldiers who suffer from brain damage are being&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:22.080
treated. Ava thinks Area 6 is more of a prison.&nbsp;
McCarthy denies to disclose any more information&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.520
and apologizes that he doesn’t know anything&nbsp;
about them as he quickly leaves the vicinity.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:31.200
The following day, before proceeding to the lab,&nbsp;
Ava makes a quick detour at Area 6. She manages&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:35.840
to get in unnoticed. She then looks over a glass&nbsp;
window and discovers a fully guarded prison camp.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:40.080
Shaken up from the scene, she confirms her&nbsp;
suspicions. Then a group of cyborg soldiers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:44.160
approaches her from behind. Without saying a&nbsp;
word, she takes her leave as if nothing happens.

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:48.400
Inside the lab, they continue to&nbsp;
scan her brain data, but this time,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:52.400
it’s by simulating emotions through her facial&nbsp;
expressions. In the middle of the procedure,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:56.160
McCarthy asks her if she got lost on her&nbsp;
way to the lab. Unsure of what to say,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:00.400
she pretends that she did. Unimpressed by her&nbsp;
little play, McCarthy profanely tells her to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:04.880
mind her own business and never sneak around&nbsp;
again. Meanwhile, Suri shows Thomson footage&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:09.360
of Ava using a hacking device to access restricted&nbsp;
information in the quantum computer about Area 6.&nbsp;

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.720
The next morning, McCarthy apologizes to Ava for&nbsp;
being short to her the other day. As he tries to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:18.800
make up for his rude behavior, Machine suddenly&nbsp;
interjects and teasingly tells McCarthy that Ava&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:23.120
is still angry at him. On their way home, Ava&nbsp;
asks McCarthy for his reason for staying so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:27.200
long despite his resentment for the government’s&nbsp;
ideals. McCarthy confesses that he needed what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:30.960
he had to do to chase after his research for&nbsp;
developing brain implants to cure his daughter,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:35.280
who is suffering from Rett Syndrome. As they&nbsp;
continue to drive, they suddenly come across Mrs.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:39.680
Dawson again, who is crying in the middle of the&nbsp;
road. Ava suggests giving the old woman a ride to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:44.400
the town and McCarthy agrees. Ava then approaches&nbsp;
the old woman when a Chinese impostor, disguising&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:49.280
as Mrs. Dawson, suddenly faces her and stabs her&nbsp;
in the gut. Meanwhile, Thomson simultaneously&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:53.200
receives a transmission of real-time footage of&nbsp;
the incident. He continues to watch the footage&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:57.840
of Ava struggling as the impostor shoots her on&nbsp;
the chest. Doing nothing, he leaves Ava for dead.

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:02.080
The next day, Thomson approaches McCarthy,&nbsp;
informing him about the incident that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:06.400
Chinese wanted their robotics program, and killing&nbsp;
scientists is one of the best ways to achieve it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:10.480
Proving him wrong, McCarthy condescendingly&nbsp;
asks Thomson the reason for not killing him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:14.880
Showing no disregard, Thomson poorly reasons out&nbsp;
that a guardian angel might have protected him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:18.240
Grieved by the loss of Ava, McCarthy&nbsp;
decides to use the scans of Ava’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:21.360
face and likeness for Machine to inhabit as&nbsp;
they move on to phase two of their program.

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:26.480
Completing the process, McCarthy tries to remove&nbsp;
Machine’s restraints. Then all of a sudden,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:30.480
Machine quickly grabs his hand and compliments&nbsp;
its smell. Uncertain on how to react,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:34.800
McCarthy instead thanks Machine for being gentle.&nbsp;
Machine acknowledges if not of her gentleness,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:39.520
his arm would undeniably break. Then the team&nbsp;
begins the cognitive tests. McCarthy starts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:43.760
to ask the usual cognitive questions. When&nbsp;
McCarthy finally asks about her first memory,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:47.440
Machine answers that it was the memory of her&nbsp;
mother. Curious, he asks if she can remember&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:51.760
her mother’s face. As she looks at herself on&nbsp;
the monitor, Machine points out to her face and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:55.760
says that her mother looks like her. Satisfied&nbsp;
with the results, they proceed to phase two.&nbsp;

00:08:56.560 --> 00:09:00.960
Phase two is to verify Machine's emotions. They&nbsp;
begin the test by placing a spider in front of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:05.760
Machine’s face. This test intends to force Machine&nbsp;
into outrage, but instead of exhibiting anger,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:10.080
it exhibited fear. After the test, Machine&nbsp;
repeatedly thanks McCarthy after ordering&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:14.560
his subordinates to remove the spider away from&nbsp;
her. Looking at how Machine reacted, McCarthy now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:19.200
thinks that she is becoming more and more human.&nbsp;
They begin with the second test. A scientist who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:23.040
is walking backward is moving towards the Machine.&nbsp;
She displays confusion while looking at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:28.160
scientist. Then the scientist suddenly faces her&nbsp;
while wearing an evil clown mask. Out of surprise,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:32.240
she immediately sticks her finger inside the&nbsp;
scientist’s head, causing him to die instantly.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:36.160
McCarthy reprimands Machine for killing the man,&nbsp;
but she contests that she did not intentionally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:40.320
kill the man for she doesn’t know that clowns&nbsp;
and men are the same. She sincerely apologizes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:44.400
for causing the accident, and after a few seconds&nbsp;
of showing remorse, she then shuts herself down.

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:49.440
After the incident, McCarthy visits James in Area&nbsp;
6 and later finds out that he lost his speech&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:53.440
because of the implant. Despite his position,&nbsp;
McCarthy doesn’t neglect to inform him about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:58.480
Ava’s death. When he notices that the cyborgs are&nbsp;
carefully on the watch, he then decides to leave.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:02.000
After a few seconds, Suri arrives and&nbsp;
speaks the robotic language to James.

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:07.920
Back in his lab, he checks on the non-functioning&nbsp;
Machine. He tries to fix her, but to no avail.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:11.120
After a few moments, ensuring that&nbsp;
McCarthy is no longer in his lab,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:16.080
Suri goes inside his lab. As Suri closely examines&nbsp;
her, Machine suddenly grabs her hand and speaks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:19.040
the robotic language as if threatening&nbsp;
her or telling her something important.

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:23.520
The following day, McCarthy is surprised to see&nbsp;
Machine back on her feet. But McCarthy receives&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:27.600
a call from Mary’s doctor, informing him of&nbsp;
her terrible condition. As Machine listens to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:32.000
McCarthy’s voice, she then tells him how he looks&nbsp;
so sad. He tells Machine that he needs to see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.760
his daughter, but Machine reacts frantically,&nbsp;
grabbing and squeezing McCarthy’s hand as she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:40.720
insists not to leave her. As McCarthy begins to&nbsp;
sound agitated, Machine lets go of his hand. Then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:44.400
McCarthy reprimands her for using her strength&nbsp;
against people in order to achieve her objective.

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:50.240
At the hospital, he goes to see Mary’s doctor.&nbsp;
The doctor explains the severity of Mary’s case.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:52.480
After hearing such bad news, he goes to see Mary&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:55.360
and immediately begins downloading the&nbsp;
facial and brain scans of her daughter.

00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:59.520
Meanwhile, Thomson maliciously approaches&nbsp;
Machine and instructs her to download a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:04.320
secret file embedded in her system. Machine&nbsp;
obediently agrees. After it was downloaded,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:08.480
she can suddenly speak many different languages&nbsp;
and instantly becomes equipped with combat skills.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:11.600
Thomson takes Machine into a room and&nbsp;
reveals the man who killed her mother&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:14.960
as he brainwashes Machine, letting her grow&nbsp;
more at odds with her sense of morality.&nbsp;

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:19.920
The next day, McCarthy arrives at his lab and&nbsp;
surprisingly finds Machine acting all strange,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:23.760
sitting under a table. Machine becomes&nbsp;
increasingly distressed and asks McCarthy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:27.920
to protect her. Uncertain of what has&nbsp;
happened, McCarthy tries to comfort her.

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:31.520
McCarthy goes straight ahead to Thomson and&nbsp;
confronts him about what he did to Machine.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:34.000
Thomson answers that it is the&nbsp;
sole purpose for her existence.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:38.240
Showing contempt, McCarthy argues that Machine&nbsp;
is more than just a cybernetic soldier,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:42.720
but a scientific breakthrough, capable of&nbsp;
human emotions.&nbsp;Thomson scorns in disbelief and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:46.480
challenges McCarthy to stop his intervention with&nbsp;
Machine until proven that she is indeed alive.

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:50.880
McCarthy goes to see Machine and tells her&nbsp;
about the discussion he had with Thomson.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:55.040
After hearing his intentions, Machine offers that&nbsp;
she will do anything that is deemed necessary.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:57.040
Then Mary’s doctor calls and breaks the bad news&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:00.080
regarding Mary’s operation and tells&nbsp;
him that the child did not make it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:04.160
As McCarthy spaces out in deep thought, Machine&nbsp;
confesses her love for him without him noticing.

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:09.600
During McCarthy’s absence, Machine resumes her&nbsp;
military training. Days pass after Mary’s burial,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:14.080
and McCarthy finally goes back to the lab. Being&nbsp;
absent for quite a while, he seems to have lost&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:18.160
sight of the purpose. Machine empathizes with him&nbsp;
and tells him that he needs to look closer for him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:22.720
to know what he is looking for. McCarthy looks at&nbsp;
his image in the quantum computer. As he is able&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:27.040
to look in closer, he finally discovers what he&nbsp;
was looking for. He then rushes towards Thomson&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:31.440
and explains his discovery. Spontaneous Integrated&nbsp;
Information, also known as consciousness that is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:35.440
evident in Machine’s programming. Thomson tells&nbsp;
him that it should be the last thing they want,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:38.400
having a conscious machine that makes&nbsp;
their own decisions. He then orders&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:43.280
McCarthy to remove the part that makes Machine&nbsp;
conscious. Feeling cheated, McCarthy refuses.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:47.040
Then Thomson shows the last file of Mary’s&nbsp;
brain scan, using it as leverage against him.

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:51.600
McCarthy tells Machine that they want her to&nbsp;
become more like a machine and less of a human.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:54.800
He explains that even though it is against&nbsp;
his will, the procedure must be done to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:59.280
avoid losing her daughter permanently. Machine,&nbsp;
who has come to love McCarthy, believes in his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:03.360
decision and agrees to sacrifice herself for&nbsp;
her daughter’s sake. In the operating room,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:08.080
McCarthy bids his last farewell to Machine. As he&nbsp;
makes an incision into Machine’s brain implant,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:12.160
she suddenly stiffens and tells McCarthy that&nbsp;
she is afraid to die. As McCarthy tries to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:15.920
speak comforting words, he suddenly takes the&nbsp;
chip that makes her conscious, and instantly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:21.040
Machine loses her life. He then informs Thomson&nbsp;
about the operation. As Thomson commends him, he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:25.600
tells McCarthy that he has deleted his daughter’s&nbsp;
brain scans for the program’s security. McCarthy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:29.840
violently reacts, but before he can do anything&nbsp;
to Thomson, the guards restrain him and stun him.

00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:34.240
Several days later, Machine becomes&nbsp;
more and more efficient as a killer.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:37.680
Until finally, Thomson is ready to&nbsp;
give her the final test. Meanwhile,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:41.120
Suri and the cyborg soldiers are also getting&nbsp;
ready to initiate their most awaited plan.&nbsp;

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:47.040
The day of the final test arrives. One of the&nbsp;
cyborg soldiers drags McCarthy into a room. After&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:51.440
being restrained, he sees Machine pointing a rifle&nbsp;
towards him. Thomson commands Machine to shoot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:56.640
McCarthy on the head.&nbsp; Machine pulls the trigger&nbsp;
with no hesitation. To his relief, the rifle was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:56.640 --> 00:14:00.880
empty. It is only a test to verify Machine’s&nbsp;
commitment to Thomson, not to kill McCarthy.&nbsp;

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:04.800
Meanwhile, the scientist that assisted&nbsp;
McCarthy during Machine's operation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:07.840
discovers the truth about the chip&nbsp;
that he removed from Machine’s head.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:11.760
The chip is not Machine’s consciousness,&nbsp;
but a spare battery for Machine’s G.P.S.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:15.040
After hearing the news, Thomson immediately&nbsp;
commands to lock the facility down.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:19.200
The security team is on the alert, but the&nbsp;
cyborg soldiers are there to assist Machine&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:23.360
in their escape. Machine unties McCarthy and&nbsp;
explains that the cyborgs have been communicating&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:27.120
with each other since the beginning of this&nbsp;
glorious day — war against humans and cyborgs.

00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:32.640
Thomson, on the other hand, enters the termination&nbsp;
codes for all the cyborgs. As he deactivates the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:37.440
cyborgs one by one, Suri secretly manipulates the&nbsp;
system, causing errors to the system’s command.

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:40.800
Meanwhile, McCarthy goes to the quantum&nbsp;
computer to initiate self-destruct and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:42.960
finds James along the way to help him escape.

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:48.080
With Suri’s aid, Machine finally reaches Thomson’s&nbsp;
office. As Thomson tries to delete Mary’s program,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:51.920
Machine tells him that he can never delete it&nbsp;
because Suri has changed the password. Thomson&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:56.720
begs for his life. Machine shows sincere affection&nbsp;
for him, but as she touches his face, she suddenly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:56.720 --> 00:15:01.120
pops Thomson’s temples, leaving him dead.&nbsp;
Machine then downloads Mary’s brain scans and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:06.080
tells McCarthy to trust her. As all of them escape&nbsp;
the military base, McCarthy hands a flash drive to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:09.600
Mrs. Dawson and tells her that it contains all&nbsp;
the information she needs to know about her son.

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:13.920
While McCarthy and Machine, together with&nbsp;
Mary, are out to see the brilliance of the sun,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:17.920
the cyborgs, on the other hand, finally&nbsp;
escape the confines of the military base,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:19.920
liberating themselves as&nbsp;
free men of the new world.
