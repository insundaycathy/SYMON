00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.420
Ned then goes to a cemetery, followed by Walter.

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.670
In cemetery he notices a grave for Laura Tollins.

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:58.300

a birthday present for him.

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.131
In background, Future Walter says that if
he was never late in catching the dog, then

00:01:16.131 --> 00:01:20.680
Agatha would have never red that book, and
the chaos wouldn’t have started at all.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.979
Later, they’re in the mood and they go to
home to have a birthday sandwich, but the

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:30.441
kids are awake, so they stay outside, their
son Robin, comes out and he interrupts them,

00:01:30.441 --> 00:01:32.630
then they go inside.

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.770
He gives him a mug as a present.

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.870
Walter then starts reading the book, he reads
about the main character, a detective in it,

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:43.270
who refers to himself as Fingerling.

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:48.750
The next day, he reads the chapter 2, Fingerling
describes about his childhood in it, as a

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.560
kid he was top in his class, so that he can
leave his home, He claims he loved his dad,

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.890
but he didn’t want to be like his dad.

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.110
Since, his dad was an accountant and he only
cared about money, he says his neighbour is

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.530
the reason he became detective, neighbour’s
dog used to come in their yard, and it was

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.030
his job to catch it.

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.060
He was prohibited from going to neighbour’s
house, but he broke the rule on his 8th birthday,

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.650
and there he found the lady dead, doctors
claimed that it was suicide, but he speculated

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.830
that it was done by a passionate serial killer.

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.970
And that’s how detective fingerling was
born.

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:27.150
Then his wife interrupts him, and he asks
her if she red this book earlier? and she

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.760
answers that the author is very creative.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.350
However, Walter thinks this book has a lot
of resemblance to his life as a kid, and it’s

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.300
like his childhood in it.

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.770
He shows her the book, and he mentions the
incident of fingerling saying he went through

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:44.900
the similar events, and that is the reason
he became animal control officer.

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.660
Their son gets home, and he asks If he is
in the book and Walter continues reading.

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:55.230
In chapter 3, A woman named Fabrizia is Fingerling’s
girlfriend, and they both are having a spicy

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.830
hormone sandwich.

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.940
The next day, Walter wakes up early and he
goes to a park to read further.

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:08.470
In chapter 5, Fingerling is sent to a suicidal
woman, she’s named Suicide Blonde, she is

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.540
about to take her life, but Fingerling tells
her that it’s his birthday and he cannot

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.750
see anyone dying on his birthday, so she changes
her mind, and she starts explaining her life

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.739
story to him, she tells him about her abusive
ex-boyfriend.

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:25.989
She further shows him her writings on the
wall about her theory on number 23, and she

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:30.819
believes that number 23 rules her world, she
tells him that she was born on 23rd of the

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:36.019
month, and her favourite color is pink, which
in the colour accent number is 23, she gives

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:40.790
more examples, he says he was listening to
her, so he keeps her distracted from taking

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:42.349
her life.

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:46.349
He then cracks some jokes to make her smile
and he leaves from there.

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:51.330
As he walks, she jumps from her apartment
balcony to her death, fingerling is clearly

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.150
disappointed.

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:57.960
The next day, he went to see ex-boyfriend
of Suicidal Blonde, and he is found dead as

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:02.599
well, he told Fabrizia about the apartment,
and then she was turned on from the murder

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:04.510
scene and they had a feast there.

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.640
The more he researched about the blonde, the
more he learnt about the number 23, even that

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:14.410
woman’s name alphabets on number had the
total of number 23, Walter is stunned after

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:19.079
reading it, and he goes to the bookstore,
he learns that the author only wrote one book

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:22.790
and there is no further information available
about the author.

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:27.720
Later at home, Walter assigns numbers to his
middle name, and it becomes the number 23,

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:33.400
and his birthday is 3rd February which is
23. and his social security number is full

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.580
of 23 as well.

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.840
He was born at 11:12pm and that adds to 23
as well.

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:44.190
She denies all theories and she reveals that
in next chapter fingerling becomes a killer

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:47.650
but Walter is not a killer, and she wants
to leave.

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:51.900
He then compares the wall colour of their
house that it matches with the book cover,

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:56.780
further he claims that Fingerling met Fabrizia
at the age of 23, and he met his wife at the

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:58.460
same age.

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:02.810
And they got married on 3th of October, which
is also number 23.

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:06.500
Robin seems to be accepting his theories and
robin calculates that their house number is

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:12.400
number 23 as well, and they moved on the date
of 23rd, they both connect more and more dots

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:13.650
together.

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:20.970
Later, in chapter 7, the couple goes to a
hotel, and they are told only room 23 is available,

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:25.730
and its 9:14 on the watch, which is also 23,
Fingerling noticed all that.

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:31.120
Then they go to bed and Fabrizia is on fire,
so she wants him to fantasize that he has

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:36.199
a knife, and he is about to kill her he says
he can never hurt her, but she wants to fantasize

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:37.350
it.

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:42.070
From that moment, Fingerling started having
nightmares about killing Fabrizia.

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:46.190
Walter gets a nightmare about Agatha as well;
he counts the pair of shoes in their house,

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:48.790
and it adds to 23.

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:53.870
The next day, Agatha sees some notes written
on Walter’s wrist saying kill her she is

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:58.920
concerned with Walter’s obsession, Agatha
refers him to her friend, Isaac French, who

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:04.640
talks to him a bit, and Isaac speculates more
to his theories by saying, blood takes 23

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:12.380
seconds to circulate, our planet earth moves
on the axis of 23.5 which is 23 and 2+5, Isaac

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:17.199
speculates 23 is the number of devil and he
suggests that Walter is being paranoid and

00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:21.530
he recommends Walter to finish the book to
find the answers he's looking for.

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:24.440
Isaac offers to speak to Agatha in the meantime.

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:29.810

and counting the shoes, which is 23 pairs

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:31.610

Walter realizes they have 23 pair of shoes
as well.

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:40.449
Fingerling tells his department shrink about
his nightmares, and about the number 23.

Then Dr. Phoenix suggests he take a break
from work, and he offers to speak to Fabrizia

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:46.860
as well.

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:51.460
Fabrizia does not find Fingerling's vacation
appealing and she was turned on when he was

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:53.120
a detective only.

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:59.130
Later, after Fingerling discovers Fabrizia

home for one night, leaving Agatha a note,
that he wants to finish the book and clear

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:05.440
his head.

issues in the room.

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:16.330
However, he still takes it.

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:21.930
In the book chapter 22, Dr. Phoenix goes to
meet Fabrizia, and he discovers a murdered

00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:24.360

the hotel balcony, mirroring Suicide Blonde's
final moments.

00:08:34.389 --> 00:08:40.729
The book ends abruptly, with no further information
on Fingerling with empty pages.

00:08:40.729 --> 00:08:44.360
Walter is that convinced the number had gone
after Fingerling and now it’s going after

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:45.829
him.

00:08:45.829 --> 00:08:51.050
Walter then spots Ned, and he decides to chase
him, blaming the dog for making him late and

00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:53.720
therefore having the curse in his life.

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:58.870
Ned runs back to the cemetery like last time
and sits in front of a grave, Walter finally

00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:03.850
catches Ned, and he looks at the collar, he
learns that Ned also has number 23 in the

00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:09.189
name, A priest arrives there and reveals that
Ned is in care of a local church, since Ned

00:09:09.189 --> 00:09:11.230
tends to visit the cemetery.

00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:17.509
Ned recently favours a certain tombstone,
Laura Tollins, who died on her 23rd birthday.

00:09:17.509 --> 00:09:22.930
Walter is tired of the number 23; Priest reveals
that they never found her body.

00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:27.220
Walter goes back to home, and he realizes
that the circumstances revolving Laura Tollins'

00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:31.480
death is similar to the book's events and
he believes Tollins' convicted killer is the

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:36.239
book's author, and the book is just a way
of killer to confess things.

00:09:36.239 --> 00:09:41.199
The next day, Walter decides to visit Kyle
Flinch in prison, and he asks him what the

00:09:41.199 --> 00:09:42.990
number means.

00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:47.220
Kyle maintains his innocence that he didn’t
kill her, and he denies both killing Laura

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:49.029
and writing the book.

00:09:49.029 --> 00:09:53.950
Walter thinks about it, and he meets Agatha,
and he explains that Since Kyle's name does

00:09:53.950 --> 00:09:57.519
not add to 23, then he is convinced that he's
innocent.

00:09:57.519 --> 00:10:02.920
Robin, who has also read the book, finds two
pages sticked together and he finds a hidden

00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:04.670
address in it.

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:10.290
Hoping it's the author's address, the family
send 23 empty packages to the address occupant,

00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:13.269
in order to entrap them at the delivery office.

00:10:13.269 --> 00:10:18.329
Agatha wants to be with him, and she assures
him that he cannot hurt her.

00:10:18.329 --> 00:10:24.839
The next day, they wait outside the post office,
A suspicious looking man enters the post office

00:10:24.839 --> 00:10:29.540
and when Walter confronts him, the man is
suddenly terrified, telling Walter that he

00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:32.860
should be dead, and he can’t be alive.

00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:37.860
The man attacks Walter with a box cutter before
slicing his own throat.

00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:42.589
Agatha attempts to stop the bleeding and she
tells Walter to take Robin home.

00:10:42.589 --> 00:10:46.189
Before dying to his injuries, the man has
notes written and he tells Agatha to go to

00:10:46.189 --> 00:10:48.310
an institute.

00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:52.640
Agatha calls Walter and she tells him that
she will be home in a little while.

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:57.360
Agatha finds the man's former work ID badge,
and she visits the institute, which is now

00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:59.709
fenced off and abandoned.

00:10:59.709 --> 00:11:02.559
She walks a bit, and she goes inside a room.

00:11:02.559 --> 00:11:08.040
Sooner, she sees the room filled with notes,
and she realizes that just like Walter, the

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:11.299
man is obsessed with the 23 enigma as well.

00:11:11.299 --> 00:11:16.420
She then discovers a patient box labelled
W. Sparrow which stands for her husband’s

00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:21.470
name Walter Sparrow, but before she opens
it, a figure approaches her from behind, and

00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:23.319
she gets scared.

00:11:23.319 --> 00:11:27.470
Meanwhile at home, Walter notices some hidden
message in the book.

00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:31.600
Then he and robin discover a secret message
within the book, telling him to go to his

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:35.529
local park, and dig beneath its steps.

00:11:35.529 --> 00:11:40.399
Walter and Robin visit the park, and they
both dig beneath its 23rd step.

00:11:40.399 --> 00:11:42.870
Sooner they discover a skeleton in it.

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:46.649
The two flee the site, then someone approaches
the grave.

00:11:46.649 --> 00:11:51.269
Walter calls the police from a phonebooth,
However, upon returning the site they discover

00:11:51.269 --> 00:11:53.439
the body has been removed.

00:11:53.439 --> 00:11:58.059
The cop thinks they both are crazy, sooner
Agatha arrives there with Isaac and she meets

00:11:58.059 --> 00:11:59.509
them.

00:11:59.509 --> 00:12:04.089
When driving home, Robin is raging out since
they both saw the skeleton and he believes

00:12:04.089 --> 00:12:07.929
in number 23 as well, but she denies it.

00:12:07.929 --> 00:12:13.379
Ned is seen in the street, and he accelerates
to run it over, but he couldn’t do it.

00:12:13.379 --> 00:12:18.790
Walter then notices Agatha's muddy fingertips
and realizes she might have moved the skeleton.

00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:22.829
Walter confronts Agatha, believing she is
the author who had murdered the book's publisher

00:12:22.829 --> 00:12:26.290
to protect herself and removed the skeleton.

00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:28.519
He then finds a knife in her purse.

00:12:28.519 --> 00:12:33.990
After some pressure from Robin and Walter,
Agatha admits only to moving the skeleton,

00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:39.079
but she then reveals that at the psychic institute,
she learnt that Walter wrote the book, she

00:12:39.079 --> 00:12:44.850
shows him the box and the original copy of
book with Walter’s name on it.

00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:50.600
Isaac arrives there and Agatha shows Walter
his old items, Walter begins partially remembering

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:55.619
his past and realizing it’s his items in
the box, he then flees the home traumatized

00:12:55.619 --> 00:12:57.249
from everything.

00:12:57.249 --> 00:12:59.389
He goes to the King Edward Hotel.

00:12:59.389 --> 00:13:06.299
Later, he rips down the wallpaper of room
23 and shockingly he discovers his past scribblings,

00:13:06.299 --> 00:13:10.329
and the missing final chapter of the book,
Chapter 23.

00:13:10.329 --> 00:13:14.739
Walter reads and remembers the events that
young Walter's mother killed herself, which

00:13:14.739 --> 00:13:17.999
unfortunately, caused his father to do the
same.

00:13:17.999 --> 00:13:22.730
Walter's father, an accountant, failed to
leave a suicide note, only his notebook containing

00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:24.910
the 23 enigmas.

00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:30.350
Few years later, in college Walter met Laura
Tollins, they both started dating, she liked

00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:35.839
spicy sausages a lot and she was turned on
by danger and she fantasized to be killed.

00:13:35.839 --> 00:13:40.410
Few weeks later, Tollins started flirting
with her teacher Kyle Flinch, the man in prison

00:13:40.410 --> 00:13:45.809
right now, to mess with Walter, upon seeing
her cheating that brought back Walter's numeral

00:13:45.809 --> 00:13:48.989
obsession with the number 23 again.

00:13:48.989 --> 00:13:52.709
Tollins had an affair with Flinch, and she
broke up with Walter writing him a note, but

00:13:52.709 --> 00:13:57.179
Walter 'deciphered' her message in the note,
and he was convinced that she was in danger,

00:13:57.179 --> 00:13:59.329
and that the number wanted to kill her.

00:13:59.329 --> 00:14:04.639
Later, Walter visited Tollins to warn her,
but she threatened him with a knife and, she

00:14:04.639 --> 00:14:09.699
made fun of him that he is pathetic just like
his father and then she cut his arm.

00:14:09.699 --> 00:14:14.819
Walter went into a disturbing state, and he
stabbed her multiple times killing her.

00:14:14.819 --> 00:14:18.980
Walter then fled with her body, and he proceeded
to bury it under the park steps while Ned

00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:20.730
witnessed it.

00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:26.660
Kyle Flinch later arrived at her place, and
he picked up the knife, incriminating himself.

00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:31.619
Out of guilt, Walter arrived at the King Edward
Hotel and began typewriting his suicide note

00:14:31.619 --> 00:14:37.149
which quickly becomes the book, changing the
details of his confession into a fantasy.

00:14:37.149 --> 00:14:40.999
He removed the chapter 23rd from the book
he wrote, and he wrote the true events all

00:14:40.999 --> 00:14:45.930
over the room's walls, he was clearly in a
disturbing state from the events, then he

00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:48.720
jumped out the window to end his own life.

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:52.779
Walter survived his suicide attempt but due
to his head trauma and survivors’ guilt

00:14:52.779 --> 00:14:55.209
he was left with amnesia.

00:14:55.209 --> 00:14:59.169
Walter was rehabilitated at the institute
and after few months his brain blocked those

00:14:59.169 --> 00:15:03.549
memories, he was then released and that’s
how he met Agatha.

00:15:03.549 --> 00:15:08.850
Meanwhile, one of his doctors had obtained
Walter's novel and began to be consumed by

00:15:08.850 --> 00:15:14.279
the number 23 obsession, eventually publishing
it under the name Topsy Kretts.

00:15:14.279 --> 00:15:18.129
Back in the present, Agatha finds Walter at
the Hotel.

00:15:18.129 --> 00:15:22.889
Walter remembers everything and tells Agatha
he's a murderer, but Agatha argues that he

00:15:22.889 --> 00:15:28.509
isn't the same person, and he was never a
bad person, he was just sick and now he is

00:15:28.509 --> 00:15:31.209
well, and a wonderful husband.

00:15:31.209 --> 00:15:36.459
Walter is feeling guilty because a man is
in prison the one his ex-had affair with.

00:15:36.459 --> 00:15:40.250
Walter tells Agatha to leave before he kills
anyone again.

00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:42.860
Walter flees the hotel and runs into the street.

00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:46.040
There, across the road Ned is staring at him.

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:51.059
As Walter stares at the dog a bus number 23
comes towards him at full speed.

00:15:51.059 --> 00:15:55.459
Almost allowing himself to be run over, Walter
steps out of the way at the last second when

00:15:55.459 --> 00:16:00.550
he realizes his son is watching, not wanting
to repeat the cycle his own father created

00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:02.630
few years ago.

00:16:02.630 --> 00:16:06.709
Walter then hugs both Agatha and Robin apologizing
to them.

00:16:06.709 --> 00:16:11.459
Later, A funeral procession takes place in
front of Tollins' grave, where it is implied,

00:16:11.459 --> 00:16:14.279
her body has finally been laid to rest.

00:16:14.279 --> 00:16:18.999
And he finally understands that it's just
a number, and he wants justice so Walter hands

00:16:18.999 --> 00:16:23.479
himself in to the police, and he awaits sentencing
and he is told a judge will likely go easy

00:16:23.479 --> 00:16:26.479
on him due to handing himself in.

00:16:26.479 --> 00:16:31.009
Then he sees the number 23 on the clock And
