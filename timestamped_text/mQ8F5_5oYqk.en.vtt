00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.700
Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:07.090
Today, I’m going to show a 1997 action,
adventure, and sci-fi film called, “The

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:08.340
Fifth Element.”

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:09.710
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:11.300
Watch out and take care.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:16.939
It’s 1914 and Professor Pacoli and his student,
Billy Masterson, are investigating the ruins

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:18.650
of an Egyptian temple.

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.779
Pacoli is on the verge of discovering an ancient
prophecy and interprets the writings on the

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:23.779
walls.

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:27.849
It speaks of a great evil that will come in
5,000 years, unleashing from a black hole

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:29.970
and causing chaos and death.

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.649
The only thing that can stop it is a weapon
consisting of the four elements, water, fire,

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.390
earth, and air, and the fifth element, a perfect
being.

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.060
Pacoli believes that the fifth element is
the key, but he is unable to figure it out.

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:47.160
Just then, a priest from the secret order
approaches the two men, offering a toast of

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.309
poisoned water to their success.

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:53.129
Pacoli throws out the water and insists that
they drink wine instead.

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.309
Just then, an enormous ship lands on top of
the pyramid.

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.210
The priest is terrified and gasps that they’re
here.

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.780
Huge robotic-like creatures emerge from the
ship and approach the men.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.479
The priest pleads with them, telling them
that Pacoli was about to discover everything

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.590
but he arrived just in time.

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.490
The alien race, known as the Mondoshawans,
reveals that the priest was their human contact

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.100
from Earth and tells him that they must take
the stones and the fifth element because war

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.700
is coming and it’s no longer safe on Earth.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.380
The leader takes out the key and opens the
walls.

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.469
The absurdity of the events causes Pacoli
to faint, while the priest can only look on

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:31.119
as the Mondoshawans take the four stones and
the sarcophagus containing the fifth element.

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:35.570
Billy regains his composure and fires at the
aliens, thinking they have killed Pacoli.

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.210
The priest tries to stop him, but it’s too
late.

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.820
As the wall closes on the Mondoshawan’s
leader, the alien gives the priest the key

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.470
and his last mission.

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.270
As the ship flies away, the priest promises
them to pass the knowledge until their return.

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:54.460
300 years pass and it’s the year 2263 on
Earth, the year of the prophecy.

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.250
The great evil appears as a giant fireball
traveling towards the blue planet.

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.620
A military spaceship in direct line with the
President observes the threat.

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:06.719
Just as they’re about to shoot the fireball,
a priest named Vito Cornelius from the secret

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.200
order intervenes.

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.460
He insists that there’s no use shooting
the threat and the only thing that can save

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.270
humanity is within a great prophecy of the
four and fifth elements.

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.840
The President dismisses his theory and proceeds
to shoot anyway.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.780
The fireball absorbs the missiles and hurls
them back at the ship, destroying it instantly.

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.670
Back on Earth, Korben Dallas is a divorced,
ex-soldier, now working as a taxi driver and

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.130
living in a cramped apartment with his cat.

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.760
His close friend, Finger, calls him and they
plan to meet up tonight.

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.010
Korben gets about his usual day, apprehending
a mugger, and taking his taxi out for his

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.800
first drive of the day.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.270
Back at the President’s headquarters, Cornelius
explains his theory in detail and convinces

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:50.440
the President to grant the Mondoshawans, who
are carrying the elements, into their territory.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.410
On their way to Earth, the Mondoshawans are
attacked by a group of rogue aliens called

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.730
Mangalores and take the box containing the
elements.

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:02.210
The Mangalores contact their human conspirator,
Jean-Baptiste Emanuel Zorg, who is working

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:05.140
for the great evil and they agree to meet
at his factory.

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:10.160
The government visits the crash site and manages
to retrieve a surviving hand from the Mondoshawans,

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.100
taking it to their research lab.

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.860
In a recovery chamber, scientists reconstruct
the hand’s DNA back to life.

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.900
After a quick reconstruction process, the
chamber reveals a naked woman lying on the

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:21.900
table.

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.000
The woman wakes up and is shocked to find
herself trapped inside the glass chamber.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.370
She cries out in an ancient language.

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.020
One of the generals approaches her and taps
on the glass, taunting her.

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:36.190
The woman breaks her hand through the glass
and knocks out the general and takes his multipass

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:37.190
card.

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.020
The alert bells start ringing and she finds
herself trapped in the room.

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:44.760
Seeking the only way out, she breaks through
the walls and escapes through the ventilation

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:45.780
system.

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.900
She soon finds herself at the top of the building
and jumps to escape the police.

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.420
She lands right on Korben’s flying cab.

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.330
Korben checks on his impromptu passenger and
feels instantly attracted and intrigued by

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:57.470
her.

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:02.200
Sensing her vulnerability, he decides to protect
her from the pursuing police officers.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.510
They race through the streets with three police
cars chasing them.

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:09.560
Korben takes a sharp turn and leads them through
a rundown part of the city, losing one car

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.220
to a delivery truck.

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.010
They get back on the main street and a horde
of police cars fire at them.

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.789
Korben takes them down to the innermost streets
and through the fog, disappearing from the

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:20.310
police’s radar.

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.540
The woman tells him to take her to a priest
named Vito Cornelius and he manages to track

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:26.349
him down to his apartment.

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:30.319
Cornelius sees the elemental marks on her
arm and faints when he realizes that she’s

00:04:30.319 --> 00:04:31.660
the fifth element.

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.509
Not wanting to waste time, he gets his assistant,
David, and they prepare to meet the fifth

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:36.509
element.

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:40.819
Meanwhile, Korben glances at the sleeping
woman and kisses her, only to be met by her

00:04:40.819 --> 00:04:41.819
gun.

00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:45.889
He apologizes, calms her down, and learns
that her name is Leeloo.

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:50.330
Cornelius and David arrive to give her the
key to the tomb and usher Korben outside.

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:54.530
He goes back to his apartment and calls Finger,
apologizing that he didn’t stick to their

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:56.570
meetup and telling him about Leeloo.

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:01.100
Meanwhile, Leeloo learns 5,000 years’ worth
of history through Cornerlius’s computer

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:05.039
and tells him that the stones have been stolen
but she knows exactly where they are.

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:09.060
At the same moment, Zorg meets up with the
Mangalores and their leader, Aknot.

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:14.440
Zorg trades the stones for new weapons, but
when Aknot hands over the box, it’s empty.

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:18.200
Cornelius then learns that the Mondoshawans
gave the stones to someone they could trust

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:21.030
and Leeloo was supposed to contact this person.

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:24.999
They track the person down to a hotel called
Fhloston Paradise in Planet Fhloston.

00:05:24.999 --> 00:05:29.729
Suddenly, there’s a knock on the door and
a group of men appear and take Cornelius to

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:30.729
Zorg.

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:34.270
He threatens the priest to tell him where
the stones are but he doesn’t give in.

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:39.360
As he explains his plan to Cornelius, he chokes
on a piece of cherry and Cornelius saves him.

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:44.220
Zorg spares his life and lets him go and orders
his henchmen to track down the stones.

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:48.330
His men intercept a meeting with the President
and learn that the Mondoshawans gave the stones

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:53.509
to a diva named Plavalaguna who will be performing
at a charity ball at the Fhloston Paradise.

00:05:53.509 --> 00:05:57.229
The President agrees and asks the military
to hire their best agent which happens to

00:05:57.229 --> 00:05:58.729
be Korben Dallas.

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:02.020
The soldiers manage to track down Korben to
his apartment.

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:06.210
He finds out that the military rigged a raffle
contest to let him win two tickets to Fhloston

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:10.449
Paradise so that he could go undercover and
retrieve the stones discreetly.

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:14.449
Just then, Leeloo appears outside his door
and Korben manages to convince the soldiers

00:06:14.449 --> 00:06:18.139
to hide in his fridge by lying that Leeloo
is his girlfriend whom he’s planning to

00:06:18.139 --> 00:06:20.180
marry but hates the military.

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:24.520
He lets Leeloo in and Cornelius threatens
him with a gun and asks for the tickets.

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:27.620
Just then, the police swarm the building looking
for Korben.

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:31.740
He hides Leeloo and the priest in his apartment
and the police arrest the wrong guy.

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:36.080
The Mangalores arrive and intercept the arrest,
snatching the body bag and not knowing that

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:37.930
they took the wrong guy too.

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:42.210
Once the coast is clear, Korben takes Leeloo
and Cornelius out of hiding.

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:45.699
The priest knocks him out momentarily and
steals the tickets.

00:06:45.699 --> 00:06:49.279
When Korben regains consciousness, he accepts
the mission.

00:06:49.279 --> 00:06:54.169
Leeloo and Cornelius arrive at the airport
with David who acquired fake passports.

00:06:54.169 --> 00:06:57.960
Just as they’re about to check-in, Korben
arrives and takes David’s place.

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:00.900
David runs to Cornelius and tells him what
happened.

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:05.289
The priest instructs him with the key to prepare
the temple while he goes after the other two.

00:07:05.289 --> 00:07:09.669
The Mangalores arrive, disguised as Korben
and Leeloo, but they are caught up with security

00:07:09.669 --> 00:07:10.800
quickly.

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:15.449
Korben is then whisked away by a flight attendant
to meet the flamboyant radio talk show host,

00:07:15.449 --> 00:07:16.669
Ruby Rhod.

00:07:16.669 --> 00:07:20.590
Cornelius sneaks into the restricted area
and manages to get into the plane.

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:26.110
Meanwhile, Zorg is called by Mr. Shadow, the
dark entity existing within the great evil.

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:29.389
Mr. Shadow threatens Zorg to retrieve the
stones or else.

00:07:29.389 --> 00:07:32.949
In Planet Fhloston, the rocket plane arrives
at the hotel.

00:07:32.949 --> 00:07:35.129
Korben wakes up and finds Leeloo missing.

00:07:35.129 --> 00:07:37.960
Leeloo has managed to track down Plavalaguna.

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:42.210
The diva senses Leeloo hiding in the hallway
and sends out one of her assistants.

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:45.810
The assistant tells Leeloo to meet Plavalaguna
after the concert.

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:50.020
On the other hand, Korben is dragged away
by Ruby, giving him a tour of the hotel and

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:54.059
then of the opera house, as he goes on and
on in his live radio show.

00:07:54.059 --> 00:07:56.440
The concert starts as Zorg arrives.

00:07:56.440 --> 00:08:00.960
The curtains reveal Plavalaguna to be a blue-skinned
alien humanoid opera singer.

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:05.479
As she sings her piece, the Mangalores invade
the diva’s room and take the box.

00:08:05.479 --> 00:08:09.360
Leeloo intervenes and takes out the Mangalore
group on her own with martial art skills she

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:12.580
absorbed while learning through Cornelius’s
computer.

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:16.349
She knocks out the remaining brute just as
the diva finishes her song.

00:08:16.349 --> 00:08:20.110
Leeloo retakes the box and is stopped at the
door by Zorg and his gun.

00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:24.900
He demands the stones back and Leeloo tosses
him the box and jumps into a nearby air vent.

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:27.529
Zorg sends out rounds of fire at the vent.

00:08:27.529 --> 00:08:31.839
Meanwhile, the Mangalores have taken over
the entire hotel and are holding some guests

00:08:31.839 --> 00:08:33.000
hostage.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.880
One of them shoots Plavalaguna and she collapses
in Korben’s arms who then hides her under

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:38.120
the chairs.

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:42.880
Now with the stones in his hands, Zorg plants
a bomb in the room and leaves immediately.

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:46.980
Back at the opera house, Ruby is left alone
with Korben and the diva.

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:51.710
With her dying breath, Plavalaguna tells Korben
to help Leeloo save humanity and reveals that

00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:54.830
the elemental stones are actually stored inside
of her.

00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:58.730
This comes as an extreme disappointment to
Zorg when he realizes that the box is empty

00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:01.340
and he goes back to Fhloston Paradise.

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:05.580
Korben takes a Mangalore down and instructs
a frantic Ruby to hold a gun to the alien’s

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:06.580
head.

00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:09.620
He then opens the diva’s wounds and retrieves
the four stones.

00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:14.320
He wraps them in his jacket and hands them
to Ruby, asking him to guard it with his life.

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:18.290
As the Mangalores surround the area, Korben
takes the gun and kills several members of

00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:19.390
the crew.

00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:23.280
The aliens fire back with missiles and drive
him to hide behind a bar.

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:25.970
Ruby crawls and escapes to one of the balconies.

00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:29.220
The Mangalores have Korben trapped now as
they make him emerge from the rubble with

00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:30.460
hands up.

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:34.370
Korben spots Ruby up at the balcony and signals
him to move to the side.

00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:38.900
One of the aliens orders him to get down and
he jumps on a plank of wood, sending the alien’s

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:40.790
head through Ruby’s balcony.

00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:45.120
Ruby holds him down and the alien panics,
firing his gun at his crew.

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:48.670
Korben gets a hold of a gun and fires it at
the remaining aliens.

00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:52.660
As more of them start spilling into the room,
Korben takes Ruby and launches a grenade at

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:53.660
them.

00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:57.800
With guns firing at them, they hide under
a table and survive the explosion.

00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:01.640
They make their way to the control room where
the remaining Mangalores are holding Cornelius

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:03.680
and several other humans hostage.

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:07.860
As they take down some of the alien crew,
Korben identifies their leader and plans to

00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:12.050
kill him, stating that no Mangalore will fight
if their leader is killed.

00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:15.890
Just then, the leader asks the humans to send
in someone to negotiate.

00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:19.320
Korben volunteers and swiftly kills the leader
with one shot.

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:23.610
With the hotel back under the human’s control,
Korben manages to track down an unconscious

00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:25.640
Leeloo at the diva’s room.

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:28.630
Cornelius and Ruby follow him and discover
the bomb.

00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:31.860
The alarms go off and the guests are immediately
evacuated.

00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:36.180
The group makes their way to the docks just
as Zorg arrives back at the hotel room.

00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:38.340
They find Zorg’s ship and board it.

00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:41.640
Back at the hotel room, Zorg deactivates the
bomb.

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:45.870
Unbeknownst to him, the last Mangalore alive
activates their own bomb as revenge and it

00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:48.010
detonates, killing Zorg instantly.

00:10:48.010 --> 00:10:53.450
Korben, Leeloo, Cornelius, and Ruby safely
escape through the stolen ship.

00:10:53.450 --> 00:10:57.430
On their way to Egypt, Leeloo gains consciousness
and talks to Korben about the strangeness

00:10:57.430 --> 00:10:58.690
of humans.

00:10:58.690 --> 00:11:03.060
The two share an intimate moment and Korben
can’t help but feel more attracted to her.

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:07.430
Meanwhile, the fireball has picked up its
pace and is racing towards Earth with dangerous

00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:08.430
speed.

00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:11.310
The President calls Korben and gives him the
ultimatum.

00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:14.690
They have about two hours before humanity
is wiped away.

00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:19.030
Back at the ship, Leeloo learns about the
violent history of wars between humans.

00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:23.310
She is disgusted, disappointed, and shocked
to learn that she’s saving a race that’s

00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:24.950
causing so much violence.

00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:29.220
The group lands in the desert and is met by
David who takes them to the temple’s center.

00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:32.380
Korben carries Leeloo and places her on the
center table.

00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:36.590
With little time left, the group tries to
figure out a way to activate the weapon.

00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:41.020
They match the stones to their respective
places but have no idea how to open them.

00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:44.880
Korben tries to wake Leeloo up and asks her
how to open the stones, but she can only give

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:47.140
out a cryptic message in her dazed state.

00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:48.430
Wind blows.

00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:49.730
Fire burns.

00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:50.970
Rain falls.

00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:55.260
There are only three minutes left to annihilation
and David stands in front of his stone feeling

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:56.260
desperate.

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.940
He lets out a sigh and suddenly his stone
moves.

00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:03.130
The group gathers around and Korben figures
out that they need to imitate the elements.

00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:06.260
He blows on the box and a glowing golden stone
emerges.

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:10.530
David runs to the earth box and dumps sand
into it, revealing the earth stone.

00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:14.490
Cornelius then wipes his forehead and opens
the water stone with his sweat.

00:12:14.490 --> 00:12:19.240
As they gather around the last box, Korben
takes out the last piece in his matchbox.

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:22.100
He lights the box up and reveals the fire
stone.

00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:24.470
He goes back to Leeloo and wakes her up.

00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:28.290
He begs Leeloo to save them, but she says
that there’s no use in saving this world

00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:30.050
with nothing to live for.

00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:33.780
Korben breaks down and tells her that there
are things worth saving for like love.

00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:36.200
He needs Leeloo to save them because he needs
her.

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:39.750
In the last moments, Korben declares his love
and kisses her.

00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:44.150
Just as the fireball is about to hit Earth,
four beams of light erupt from the stone and

00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:46.540
hit Leeloo, activating the ultimate weapon.

00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:51.730
A blinding ray of light emerges from Leeloo’s
body, stopping the fireball in its tracks.

00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:55.400
Korben holds on to her body as he feels the
enormous force around them.

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:58.310
The lights go out after a few seconds and
it’s confirmed.

00:12:58.310 --> 00:13:01.840
The fireball has been destroyed and humanity
has been saved.

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:06.200
Korben takes an exhausted Leeloo in his arms
and they are greeted back at Earth as heroes.

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:10.840
The President tries to visit them, but the
scientists insist that they aren’t ready.

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:25.279
Inside the recovery chamber, Korben and Leeloo
engage in a passionate embrace and make love.
