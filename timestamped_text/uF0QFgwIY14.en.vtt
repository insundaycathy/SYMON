the episode she appears in seems like

00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:20.000 align:start position:0%
it's taking place on a ferry
 

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.909 align:start position:0%
it's taking place on a ferry

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:25.909 align:start position:0%

then<00:08:23.840><c> he'll</c><00:08:24.080><c> likely</c><00:08:24.400><c> have</c><00:08:24.639><c> to</c><00:08:24.720><c> go</c><00:08:24.960><c> across</c><00:08:25.360><c> this</c>

00:08:25.909 --> 00:08:25.919 align:start position:0%
then he'll likely have to go across this
 

00:08:25.919 --> 00:08:28.070 align:start position:0%
then he'll likely have to go across this
the<00:08:26.080><c> razor</c><00:08:26.560><c> he</c><00:08:26.720><c> busts</c><00:08:27.039><c> up</c><00:08:27.199><c> at</c><00:08:27.280><c> this</c><00:08:27.520><c> point</c>

00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
the razor he busts up at this point
 

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:29.670 align:start position:0%
the razor he busts up at this point
so<00:08:28.240><c> i</c><00:08:28.319><c> can</c><00:08:28.479><c> imagine</c><00:08:28.879><c> that</c><00:08:29.039><c> he'll</c><00:08:29.280><c> have</c><00:08:29.440><c> to</c>

00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:29.680 align:start position:0%
so i can imagine that he'll have to
 

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:31.430 align:start position:0%
so i can imagine that he'll have to
