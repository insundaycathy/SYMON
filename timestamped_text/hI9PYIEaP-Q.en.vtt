00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.320
﻿If you woke up with Jigsaw telling you&nbsp;
that you have seconds to find a key before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.240
you’re butchered, what would you do?
In this How to Beat video, we’ll follow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.880
Amanda and Jigsaw’s latest victims, see if&nbsp;
we can make better decisions, and ultimately&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.280
attempt to beat the Traps in Saw 3.

If you haven’t seen my videos on Saw 1 &amp; 2,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.440
go check it out to see how all&nbsp;
of the pain and suffering in this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.440 --> 00:01:55.600
sequel could have been prevented. 
Let’s see if we can beat Jigsaw and his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.600
Traps, for the third time.
We start out where Saw 2 left off,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.160
with Eric’s impulsive decision making landing&nbsp;
him in what’s quickly becoming the most&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.360
rancid bathroom on Earth.
Eric doesn’t have a game here.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.320
On the cassette tape Amanda gave him, she says&nbsp;
that he’s a test subject for future games.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:17.040
This means that there’s no playing along and&nbsp;
winning anymore. She will be back soon to rig him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.920
up in a contraption to test it’s lethality.
Eric could wait and see if the police find him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.240
but I'm not too confident in Detective&nbsp;
Kerry’s abilities. I think he’s on his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:31.760
own. Amanda could be back in a couple hours,&nbsp;
or a couple days. Either way, he needs to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.000
ready to ambush her when she arrives.
The gun lying next to him is unloaded,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.480
so he’s going to have to do Amanda in the&nbsp;
old fashioned way. He can’t ambush her in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.240
his current shackled position, which&nbsp;
really only leaves two options.
&nbsp;

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.960
Amputation, or pulverizing his ankle&nbsp;
bone into dust and slipping his wet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.120
noodle of a foot through the shackle. Tough&nbsp;
to say which one is more preferable. 
&nbsp;

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.800
I think I’d go with pulverizing my ankle for a&nbsp;
number of reasons. Less chance of bleeding out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.920
No need for a dangerous tourniquet that you might&nbsp;
have to leave on for days. No horrible infection&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.800
from using a rusty saw contaminated with the&nbsp;
decaying rotten flesh from Lawrence’s foot and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:15.200
Xavier’s throat. Less chance of the old shitty saw&nbsp;
breaking off midway into your ankle, and by only&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.440
breaking your ankle, you could potentially keep&nbsp;
your foot if you make it out of here alive.
&nbsp;

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.560
Eric opts for amputation. He bites down on&nbsp;
his shirt, lines the saw up on his ankle,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.680
but gets cold feet and rage throws one of the&nbsp;
only ways to save himself across the room.
&nbsp;

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.800
Realizing there’s no other way, and that he&nbsp;
absolutely has to get his leg free to save&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.440
himself and Daniel, he grabs a nearby toilet&nbsp;
cover and goes to town on his ankle.
&nbsp;

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:50.160
Apparently Amanda left the door unlocked like an&nbsp;
idiot, so Eric attempts his great escape. Amanda,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:55.280
did you not think that Eric would use the saw or&nbsp;
find a way out of his shackle eventually?
&nbsp;

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.120
He gets the drop on her and clubs her&nbsp;
over the head, but instead of going for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.560
the kill he tries to interrogate her&nbsp;
to find out where his son is. 
&nbsp;

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.040
I’m going to go ahead and say that this was a&nbsp;
bad call. Interrogating your enemy for answers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.720
only works when you are in a position of&nbsp;
power and they have something to gain.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.520
Neither of these are the case. Eric’s in&nbsp;
an extremely vulnerable and weak state, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:20.640
Amanda has little to gain by answering him. He’d&nbsp;
just kill her anyway. He should also know that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:26.400
Jigsaw’s accomplices are fanactical, and won’t be&nbsp;
intimidated by threats. The only way this ends is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.240
with Amanda fighting him to the death. 
Eric should have buried his knife under her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.320
jaw the first chance he had, gotten to&nbsp;
safety, and had the police conduct a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.720
thorough investigation of the building.
Amanda uses this opportunity to kick out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.680
Eric’s broken ankle and drag&nbsp;
him back into captivity.
&nbsp;

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.640
Since Eric failed his game and let Jigsaw&nbsp;
go, his rampage continues uninhibited.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:52.320
A man named Troy wakes up in a chair with chains&nbsp;
looped through his jaw, shoulders, arms, hips,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.560
heels, and hands. Each set of chains is&nbsp;
pulling on him from all directions.
&nbsp;

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:15.120
The TV turns on and Jigsaw lays out the game.
On a desk right across from him there’s a nail&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.280
bomb with 1 minute and 30 seconds counting&nbsp;
down on the timer. I know I'm supposed to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:23.760
helping Troy here, but Jigsaw should have put&nbsp;
the explosive on the other side of the jar if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:28.880
he wanted the nails to explode towards Troy. 
If we’re being real here, the chains looped around&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:34.080
his achilles and through his jaw are not coming&nbsp;
out. There’s no fucking way you are ripping your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:38.880
own jaw off. You’d need crazy leverage and&nbsp;
power to pull the tendons off the bone and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:43.440
to tear the flesh away completely so that it&nbsp;
was fully free from your body. And that’s even&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:47.840
disregarding the fact that your brain is going&nbsp;
to be actively shutting the procedure down.
&nbsp;

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:52.000
If another person put their foot on your&nbsp;
forehead, grabbed your lower jaw with both&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.560
hands, and deadlifted it with all their might,&nbsp;
I still don’t think your jaw would come loose&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:02.320
unless it’s Brian Shaw or The Mountain.
We’ve established that escape is not an option.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:07.280
The only ways to survive now are to deflect and&nbsp;
distance the blast or diffuse the bomb. 
&nbsp;

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.960
The other chains appear to be looped&nbsp;
through the epidermal layer only,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:23.200
so ripping these ones out is plausible. 
With only the jaw and achilles loop remaining,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:27.840
he should be able to move forward and to the side&nbsp;
enough to pull the bomb desk towards himself,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:31.680
or use his chair to pull it toward&nbsp;
him. Then, he can grab the bomb.
&nbsp;

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:36.480
Since this bomb looks homemade, it’s probably&nbsp;
a low enough yield that it could be survivable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:40.400
if he tossed it behind the teachers desk&nbsp;
and barricaded himself behind some of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:45.440
metal desks. Alternatively, he could pull the&nbsp;
bomb off the nail jar, put it in a desk cubby,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:49.600
and throw the cubby across the room. I wouldn’t&nbsp;
try to throw it through the windows as there’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:53.440
a high chance of it bouncing off or getting&nbsp;
caught by the blinds. You’re going to be close&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:58.400
to the bomb in an enclosed area, so you definitely&nbsp;
want to have your mouth open when it goes off. By&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:03.440
keeping your mouth open, you allow air to escape&nbsp;
your lungs when the pressure wave hits you so your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:08.560
innards don’t pop like a squeezed balloon. 
There is evidence that this bomb is survivable.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:12.320
When the police are investigating the crime&nbsp;
scene, they pick up the burnt teddy bear that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:17.600
was attached to the bomb, as well as recover the&nbsp;
functioning tape from the TV right across from it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:22.000
This is still incredibly risky, so I would&nbsp;
attempt to disarm the bomb first.
&nbsp;

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.640
The bomb looks like an explosive compound with&nbsp;
a timer serving as the electric detonator that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:31.120
triggers when the timer hits zero. It looks&nbsp;
pretty crude, and I doubt Jigsaw would have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:34.720
anticipated someone trying to diffuse&nbsp;
it and so they wouldn’t have put in a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:39.440
secondary failsafe trigger. From the looks of&nbsp;
it, simply removing the batteries on the front&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:44.160
should remove the ability to generate a current.&nbsp;
Of course, you’d still want to throw it across the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:49.280
room just in case it wasn’t fully disarmed.
Troy doesn’t try to disarm or deflect the bomb.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:54.400
He hastily starts tearing the chains out before&nbsp;
assessing the situation, and makes good time,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:58.720
but inevitably can’t budge the last ring&nbsp;
through his jaw before the bomb goes off.
&nbsp;

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:08.320
Later that night Kerry is reviewing Troy’s&nbsp;
tapes and all the evidence in her bedroom.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:13.680
Eric and Riggs weren’t lying, Kerry’s obsession&nbsp;
has completely hollowed out her entire life. To&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:17.760
be fair, I don’t think you can just switch&nbsp;
it off after seeing everything she’s seen,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:22.240
and after Jigsaw had abducted one of her&nbsp;
detectives. It’s not like she can just hit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:26.480
pause, pretend everything's fine, and&nbsp;
go vacay in the Keyes to drunk karaoke&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:30.480
‘Call Me Maybe’ with her girlfriends.
When the tape ends, the channel changes to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:35.760
a live video of Kerry’s bedroom. The camera for&nbsp;
it looks like it’s coming from the closet. Kerry&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:40.240
ain’t fucking around, and blasts it with her&nbsp;
service pistol she kept bedside. I gotta give&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:45.280
her props for keeping a weapon on her at all times&nbsp;
and not hesitating to send lead into the closet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:50.560
before she checked it out. She did only shoot high&nbsp;
and center though. If you think Jigsaw’s hiding&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:55.920
in your closet, you fire high to low and left to&nbsp;
right so you can hit them if they hit the deck or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:55.920 --> 00:09:01.040
were hiding on one side of the closet. You could&nbsp;
put a bullet in the center top if you played too&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:06.880
much Splinter Cell and were extra paranoid.
Kerry goes to clear the closet. Again, props for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:11.680
keeping her gun up and not stupidly holstering&nbsp;
her weapon to check it out, like Eric did in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:22.320
bathroom at the end of Saw 2. Still, this smells&nbsp;
like a trap to me. I’d back off and call 911.
&nbsp;

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:26.640
Pigmask was smart not to hide in the&nbsp;
closet anymore. That worked on Adam, but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:31.920
Kerry’s way too on edge. Wait, where did pigmask&nbsp;
even come from? There was literally nothing but a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:37.440
wall on that side of the room. Is Amanda also an&nbsp;
apprentice of the Ozunu Ninja Assassin Clan?
&nbsp;

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:43.040
Kerry wakes up in her worst nightmare. I hope you&nbsp;
learned something from reviewing all these crime&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:44.160
scenes and tapes.
Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:07.600
so the mission’s clear. We have one minute to dunk&nbsp;
our hand in a jar of highly corrosive acid to get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:13.600
a key which unlocks or disarms the trap, or we&nbsp;
end up like a chestburster victim from Alien.
&nbsp;

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:16.560
Looking around, there’s nothing that&nbsp;
you could use the key on that would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:20.560
disarm the contraption. The padlocks on the&nbsp;
leather harness aren’t going to halt it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:25.040
and since it’s hooked into her ribcage she&nbsp;
can’t just undo the harness and pop out.
&nbsp;

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:29.760
If the acid isn’t corrosive enough to disintegrate&nbsp;
the key for an entire minute, there's no way it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:34.160
will melt through all the steel braided cables&nbsp;
that will be pulling her ribcage apart. She could&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:39.280
try to hold the metal wings closed with her arms&nbsp;
and legs, but it would be futile. The hydraulics&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:43.760
on this contraption will be far too powerful.
I’m going to go with there’s no real way to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:47.360
beat this trap. This isn’t a&nbsp;
game, it’s an execution. 
&nbsp;

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:56.960
Amanda walking in as Kerry’s ribs took flight&nbsp;
just proves that Kerry didn’t have a shot.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:00.800
Amanda would never have let her live even&nbsp;
if Kerry escaped the trap somehow.
&nbsp;

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:04.560
The only way Kerry could have survived is&nbsp;
by not getting caught in the first place,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:09.680
but since pigmask is apparently a phase-shifting&nbsp;
ninja that can pass through walls without making&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:14.560
a sound, she didn’t stand a chance.
Amanda and Jigsaw’s next victim is Dr.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:17.840
Lynn. After rolling out of bed with&nbsp;
her affair to save a dying kid,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:22.880
Amanda jumps her in the hospital locker room.
Lynn then wakes up gagged and tied to a wheelchair&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:27.920
in a trap factory. Compared to Jigsaw’s other&nbsp;
victims, she could have woken up in a lot worse of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:33.280
a situation. Amanda shows up with her takeout and&nbsp;
wheels Lynn over to Jigsaw’s homemade infirmary.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:38.400
Jigsaw’s not looking too hot. His beatdown from&nbsp;
Eric definitely didn’t help the cancer.
&nbsp;

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:41.840
Jigsaw tells her the 6 words&nbsp;
no woman wants to hear.
&nbsp;

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:48.800
The collar Amanda’s placing around her neck is&nbsp;
linked to Jigsaw’s heart rate monitor. The second&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:53.280
his heart rate flatlines, or she leaves this&nbsp;
building, the collar will release the spring&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:57.920
loaded hammers which will detonate the five&nbsp;
shotgun shells directed towards her neck. 
&nbsp;

00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:03.120
Lynn has to keep John alive until another victim&nbsp;
on the monitor’s outside completes their test.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:07.680
If the other victim completes all of their&nbsp;
tests, and John still has a pulse, Amanda&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:12.080
will remove her collar and she’s free to go.
There’s a lot of shit that can go wrong here.
&nbsp;

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:17.120
Based on Lynn’s ocular patdown of John,&nbsp;
his condition is rapidly deteriorating and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:22.560
he could go at any time. This hospital isn’t&nbsp;
stocked with the necessary tools, medications,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:27.040
and trained personnel to keep him alive.&nbsp;
Even with all this, John still might not be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:32.000
savable. The heart rate monitor could fail or&nbsp;
the power could temporarily go out. There’s a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:37.600
high probability the other contestant won’t win&nbsp;
their game. Amanda’s coming across as emotional,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:41.680
unpredictable, and bloodthirsty. She can’t&nbsp;
be trusted to honor the rules of the game,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:45.360
and may kill Lynn anyways. 
Playing the game is too risky,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:48.960
so Lynn needs to find a way to disarm&nbsp;
the collar and take them all out.
&nbsp;

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:52.720
Straight up trying to kill Amanda&nbsp;
for the collar’s key is pretty risky.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:57.280
Amanda will be anticipating this and won’t&nbsp;
go down easy. Both her and John might have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:01.360
remote detonators for the collar too.
Amanda see’s Lynn thinking about this option&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:11.760
and runs some reverse psychology.
Bury the axe in the base of her skull&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:16.160
right now. She won’t be able to let a scream out&nbsp;
if you do it right, and then you can grab the key,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:19.600
take the collar off, slit Jigsaw’s&nbsp;
throat, and save your husband who’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:24.320
on the monitors playing Jigsaw’s metagame.
Actually, I wouldn’t trust the key to not activate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:29.120
the collar somehow. Amanda was a little too&nbsp;
overt about putting it around her neck. Seems&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:33.520
like bait. I would try to disarm it first.
There’s a number of ways this can be done. 
&nbsp;

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:38.240
Lynn could snag one of the electric bone&nbsp;
saws, tell John she’s taking a bathroom break&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:42.160
and that Amanda’s out shopping for medical&nbsp;
supplies, then try to cut the collar off.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:46.320
It’s a bit risky, as John will wise up&nbsp;
and possibly remotely detonate her, or the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:50.960
procedure itself might set the trap off.
The least risky method is to try to yank the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:55.280
shotgun shells out of their vices. Shotgun&nbsp;
shells are made of plastic and could potentially&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:59.680
be squished and jimmyed out. If the vices are&nbsp;
too tight, she could use any one of the sharp&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:04.000
objects in the building to cut open the ends of&nbsp;
the shotgun shells and drain the shot pellets out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.240
Even without the shot, there’s a plastic wad&nbsp;
inside the shell that separates the gunpowder&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:13.760
from the shot itself. These wads get shot out too,&nbsp;
and could easily penetrate her soft neck flesh.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:18.240
She’d want to put something hard between her&nbsp;
neck and the shells to stop the wads. Lynn could&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:22.880
also use fabric and tape to cover the primers&nbsp;
of the shells, or stuff the hammer slot which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:27.200
will jam it so it can’t strike the primer.
Lynn can’t muster the courage to drop the axe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:31.680
on Amanda, and goes back to tending to Jigsaw.&nbsp;
When she palpates his head, she concludes that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:36.320
his brain is herniating and will need to be&nbsp;
decompressed with a risky surgical procedure.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:42.160
This is both good and bad news. The bad news, John&nbsp;
could die and take her with him. The good news,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:46.480
Amanda needs to be sent off to go get crucial&nbsp;
medical equipment. Amanda freaks out at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:50.560
this suggestion, and her tantrum causes&nbsp;
John’s condition to destabilize. 
&nbsp;

00:14:55.760 --> 00:15:01.120
Again, good and bad. Bad, she almost got&nbsp;
her head popped from 5 different directions.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:03.920
Good, because now Lynn’s diagnosis was validated&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:06.960
and Amanda can fuck off to go get&nbsp;
her the supplies she needs.
&nbsp;

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:11.120
With Amanda out shopping and Jigsaw&nbsp;
pacified with some calming medication,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:14.960
Lynn can use the previously mentioned&nbsp;
methods to disarm the shotgun collar,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:19.520
slit John’s throat, and make a run for it.
Lynn wastes this opportunity by prepping for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:24.640
John’s surgery, and Amanda gets back with the&nbsp;
supplies. Great, now she has to perform basement&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:29.680
cranial surgery at gunpoint. Good going.
Hopefully the other victim on the monitors can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:34.640
complete his test in a timely manner. No rush&nbsp;
bro, but we’re dead if you don’t hustle up.
&nbsp;

00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:39.840
The man wakes up in a wooden crate with&nbsp;
a cassette recorder next to him.
&nbsp;

00:15:56.880 --> 00:16:00.960
Jeff smashes out of the crate and finds&nbsp;
a box with a picture of himself, a key,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:05.360
and a note saying “open the door, Jeff.” 
He wanders down the corridor and finds a door&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:09.120
with the words, ‘face your fears’, painted&nbsp;
on it. Hope you’re ready for your first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:12.560
test. He opens the door and finds a&nbsp;
bare woman strung up in the middle&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:17.680
of the meat freezer. This ought to be good.
The door behind him closes and locks him inside,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:21.200
so he won’t be able to go back for any&nbsp;
useful materials in the corridor.
&nbsp;

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:25.440
Jeff tries the key on her padlock and the&nbsp;
door, but they don’t work. That would just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:30.320
be too easy. No, he’s going to need to play&nbsp;
the cassette tape to hear what Jigsaw has in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:47.840
store for him and this lovely lady.
How the fuck did Jigsaw know this.
&nbsp;

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:52.240
The nozzles start periodically spraying&nbsp;
Danica with, I want to say water,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:56.960
but cold water wouldn’t kill her that fast.&nbsp;
Jeff needs to find a key behind those pipes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:56.960 --> 00:17:02.240
which means Danica has to be within seconds of&nbsp;
death to up the pressure and intensity. I think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:07.520
she’s getting hosed with liquid nitrogen, which&nbsp;
means she’s only got a couple spray sessions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:12.480
before she’s iced up like Boris in GoldenEye.
The most immediate thing he needs to do is get her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:17.520
out of the nozzle’s spray zone while the sprayers&nbsp;
are active. At her current hypothermic temp,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:22.480
that liquid nitrogen will start sticking and&nbsp;
causing 2nd and 3rd degree frostbite almost&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:26.560
immediately. Throwing your jacket around her&nbsp;
might help a bit, but it’s not as important&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:31.440
as getting her out of the way. He could try to&nbsp;
knot the hoses or cover them with his clothing,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:35.360
but I think there’s a better option.
He could either grab her body and pull her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:41.120
backwards, or if she has the strength, hoist her&nbsp;
up onto the beam she’s hanging from. Obviously,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:45.120
it’s going to be a bit challenging, but I’m not&nbsp;
expecting her to pull some Riddick shit. 
&nbsp;

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:50.080
Two people working together and having her pull&nbsp;
up while using his back as a stand might work.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:54.400
She did say she was so cold she couldn’t&nbsp;
feel her arms, so swinging her back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:57.280
sounds like the game plan.
Once the sprayers turn off,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:01.440
he can go for the key. It’s just out of arm’s&nbsp;
reach, so he’s going to need to grab one of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:05.680
those meathooks in order to snag it. Or he&nbsp;
can freeze his face off on the metal pole&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:10.160
while stretching his arm out of its socket.
Jeff wasted too much time deciding if wanted to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:14.720
forgive her, and misprioritized getting the&nbsp;
key over keeping her out of the splash zone.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:19.200
This neglect was fatal, and Danica gets&nbsp;
glassed before he can undo her shackles.
&nbsp;

00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:27.040
At least his failure to save&nbsp;
Danica didn’t end his game.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:30.240
Jeff leaves the meat freezer and&nbsp;
finds another box with a bullet,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:33.760
a picture of his son, and a note that&nbsp;
reads, “one bullet will end it all”.
&nbsp;

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:38.000
There’s another door labeled, ‘time to let&nbsp;
go’ with a bicycle and the little Jigsaw&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.640
doll reenacting what his son looked like&nbsp;
after getting hit by a car. Savage.
&nbsp;

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:47.280
Jeff pushes the door open which snaps some&nbsp;
wires and locks the door behind him again.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:51.280
He should probably start putting some of&nbsp;
those 2x4’s in each doorway he comes across&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:54.640
so he doesn’t keep getting locked in.
There’s a vat with a man chained to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:57.920
bottom of it with a cassette recorder&nbsp;
dangling on the catwalk above.
&nbsp;

00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:20.000
Okay, so, berate the judge that&nbsp;
let your son’s murderer off the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.880
hook until his screams for mercy compel you&nbsp;
to forgive him. Then incinerate some dolls,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:29.600
retrieve the key from the ashtray, and unlock&nbsp;
his collar. Simple enough. What's the catch?
&nbsp;

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:39.200
Ah. Well, technically Jeff has plenty&nbsp;
of time. This trap is more about Jeff’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:42.960
mentality than anything. I’m sure you&nbsp;
could sabotage the cow line somehow,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:46.640
or plug the gut soup’s drain hole with&nbsp;
something, but what’s the point when all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:50.320
you need to do is push a button. I’m sure&nbsp;
it’s difficult to let go of your recently&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:55.040
deceased son’s possessions, but eventually&nbsp;
your survival instinct will overcome it.
&nbsp;

00:19:55.040 --> 00:20:00.400
Jeff does about as well as he can be expected to&nbsp;
do in this trap, and saves the judges' life.
&nbsp;

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:05.360
Meanwhile, Lynn is about to start Jigsaw’s&nbsp;
operation. Before she begins, Amanda walks in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:09.920
and tells John that the other contestant made it&nbsp;
through his second test. That he was progressing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:15.280
faster than expected. Lynn has no idea how many&nbsp;
more tests the other victim has to go through,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:19.680
or if they will succeed. I’m not sure what’s&nbsp;
riskier, trying to stall the procedure and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:23.840
putting your faith in the other contestant,&nbsp;
or performing basement surgery. I don’t&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:27.680
think Lynn has much of a choice.
She gives John the local anesthetic,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:33.520
cuts his head skin off, squirts some alcohol onto&nbsp;
his exposed skull to disinfect it, power drills&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:38.240
some marker holes, and bonesaws out a square&nbsp;
opening for the brain to expand into a bit.
&nbsp;

00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:48.960
Lynn’s a hell of a surgeon for being able to&nbsp;
do all this by herself with minimal equipment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:52.960
under the threat of decapitation.
Everything seems to be going swell until&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:58.080
John’s heart rate starts plummeting. Nothing a&nbsp;
little O2 can’t fix. Amanda’s pretty distressed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:03.040
by almost losing her father-figure, and runs off&nbsp;
to do some therapy thigh-cutting. I’m guessing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:07.840
Mr. Jigsaw doesn’t know about all this.
The operation was a success, John seems to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:11.680
be stable, and the other contestant&nbsp;
is apparently making good progress.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:16.160
Lynn’s sitting in a good spot, but she’s not&nbsp;
out of the woods yet. John’s the only thing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:21.200
pumping the breaks on Amanda’s psychotic murderous&nbsp;
urges, and his condition is rapidly fading. 
&nbsp;

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:25.520
John’s pretty much passed out right now, and&nbsp;
with Amanda gone, Lynn needs to use these rare&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:30.480
moments of isolation to jam the shotgun collar’s&nbsp;
hammers and swipe a scalpel she can run across&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:34.640
Amanda’s neck when she’s not looking. 
Jeff approaches the last room’s door. There’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:39.440
another box with a magazine to load his pistol&nbsp;
round into, a picture of his daughter, and a note&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:44.960
that says, “one step closer to your revenge.”
Judge Halden gives him the tired ass spiel that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:50.160
revenge isn’t going to bring his son back, only&nbsp;
make his pain worse. Now, I haven’t suffered&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:55.920
immense loss and gotten cold-blooded revenge, so I&nbsp;
wouldn’t know whether or not he’s right. Obviously&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:55.920 --> 00:22:01.040
vengeance isn’t going to bring his son back or&nbsp;
fill the void within him, but it isn’t pointless.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:06.320
Letting a murderer go relatively scot-free because&nbsp;
punishing them won’t bring your loved one back is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:11.200
a ridiculous assertion. You’re just allowing&nbsp;
bad behavior to run without consequence. I’m&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:15.840
not saying Jeff should paint a white skull on his&nbsp;
shirt and start mercing degenerates or people that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:20.720
made terrible mistakes, but hopefully you get what&nbsp;
i’m saying. If some dickhead ran your kid over,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:24.960
got 3 months, and went on with their life&nbsp;
like nothing happened, it’s understandable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:28.880
that you’d want more retribution.
Jeff’s final test of forgiveness kicks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:33.200
off when he busts the door open and finds&nbsp;
Timothy, the drunk driver that killed his son,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:36.320
in a hell of a contraption.
Jeff hit’s play on the recorder.
&nbsp;

00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:03.280
That’s a double barrel shotgun. Jeff’s&nbsp;
going to be taking a little more than&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:06.720
a bullet when that thing fires.
It’s still somewhat unclear if letting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:11.600
Timothy die fails his game. I think he needs&nbsp;
to get the key to leave this place either way.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:16.560
Based on the message, Timothy seemed like a man&nbsp;
that just went down a bad path, and made a tragic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:21.760
mistake that he was sorry for. Jeff realizes that&nbsp;
he can’t let Timothy get murdered like this and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:25.600
heads over to the shotgun box to get the key.
Timothy’s running out of time though.
&nbsp;

00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:34.400
On the brightside for Jeff, I don’t think&nbsp;
little Timmy’s gonna be driving drunk,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:38.240
let alone driving after this.
Judge Halden is just standing around&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:43.360
like a clueless moron yelling oh my god like&nbsp;
a teenage girl. He should be attempting to jam&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:47.600
the cogs with his clothing or belt, ripping&nbsp;
out all the electrical wires he can find,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:51.120
and finding the location where Jeff should&nbsp;
use the key to stop the machine.
&nbsp;

00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:54.960
So there’s a key dangling in front of&nbsp;
the barrel, actually, under the barrel,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:58.080
and it’s held on by a little&nbsp;
screw off mount. Shotguns,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:02.560
especially longer barrelled ones like this&nbsp;
will have very concentrated spread for quite&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:07.920
a distance. It’s not like in the movies where a&nbsp;
shotgun has a 2 foot spread at 7 yards. If Jeff&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:12.880
pulled straight down or unscrewed the latch and&nbsp;
took the key, the shot would fire over his hand.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:17.840
You just want to make sure that the judge isn’t&nbsp;
in the line of fire before grabbing it.
&nbsp;

00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:25.440
Or else that will happen. Judge Halden&nbsp;
really should have been watching where he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:29.840
was stepping. He knew there was a shotgun that&nbsp;
was going to fire when Jeff ripped the key off,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:33.520
maybe watch the fuck out?
Jeff rushes over to Timothy and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:46.000
tries to find where the key needs to go to&nbsp;
stop the twister, but it’s too late.
&nbsp;

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.600
Well, Jeff got the key and made an effort&nbsp;
to forgive and save all the victims,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:53.760
so I think technically he won.

and refuses to play by the rules.
