00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.640
Story Recapped here. Today, I'm going&nbsp;
to explain a drama, horror, mystery,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.960
and science fiction film called "The Room."&nbsp;
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:16.160
A young couple, Matt and Kate move into&nbsp;
their new home in upstate New York. Both&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.680
of them enjoy the early times of being a&nbsp;
young married couple as they start anew.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.920
Their new house requires renovations and repairs&nbsp;
here and there, so they start to work around it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.640
Upon organizing the kitchen, Kate sees a dead bird&nbsp;
inside a cabinet and goes outside to bury it. She&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.560
gets distracted by Matt, who talks to her from the&nbsp;
window and looks back to see the bird disappear.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.280
While throwing away stuff&nbsp;
that came with the house,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.960
Matt notices something weird in the wall,&nbsp;
so he tears the wallpaper to see it better.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.280
In there, he uncovers a large door with a weird&nbsp;
keyhole. In an attempt to unlock the door,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.040
he rummages through the pile of old stuff&nbsp;
and finds the key. Matt inserts it into the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.720
keyhole and immediately calls Kate to tell&nbsp;
her about it. They open the door together,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.160
and the lights in the hallway suddenly&nbsp;
flicker. Matt calls the power company to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.840
report the problem, and Kate senses something&nbsp;
weird about The Room, so she follows him.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.600
The following day, an operator from&nbsp;
the power company arrives to inspect&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.440
the cause of the surges. To his surprise,&nbsp;
the wires in the basement are ancient and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.280
intertwined in such a weird-looking way. When&nbsp;
Matt asks if he can do anything about it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.040
the operator says that he has never seen&nbsp;
anything like it. Before the operator leaves,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.000
he tells Matt about the home's previous&nbsp;
owners who got murdered inside the house.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.520
Upon hearing the shocking news, he&nbsp;
immediately does his research about it.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.280
In an old news article, Matt learns that the&nbsp;
couple who died are named Paul and Madeline&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.600
Shaeffer. Moreover, the identity of the suspect&nbsp;
remains unknown and is aliased as "John Doe."&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:35.120
Matt, being an artist, tries to draw John Doe's&nbsp;
face on his sketchpad and takes a break from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.960
it inside the mysterious Room. He finishes a&nbsp;
bottle of liquor and wishes that he could have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.760
another bottle to himself. The lamp flickers,&nbsp;
and to his surprise, another bottle appears.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.640
Matt examines the bottle and realizes&nbsp;
that The Room can grant wishes.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.880
Kate wakes up to the sound of flickering lights&nbsp;
in the living room and goes upstairs to check on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.680
Matt. Inside The Room, she finds him far beyond&nbsp;
excited as space is filled with new stuff.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.120
Matt happily shows Kate an authentic Van Gogh&nbsp;
painting and explains that The Room can grant&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:03.360
any material wish. Thinking that it is one of&nbsp;
Matt's pranks, Kate laughs it off but realizes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.760
that her husband is serious. She tests his&nbsp;
theory and asks for a thousand dollars. Matt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.760
rummages around the whole Room and finally picks&nbsp;
up the money Kate wished for. Still skeptical,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.120
she asks for a million dollars and&nbsp;
just like that, they are millionaires.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.120
However, Kate finds it scary and walks out. Matt&nbsp;
persuades her that they should have fun with it.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.720
The couple spends the whole day&nbsp;
wishing their life away. Clothes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.040
champagne, art, and money are just one wish&nbsp;
within their reach. Matt and Kate's happiness&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.880
are beyond compare as they drown themselves&nbsp;
in expensive things. At the end of the night,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.800
Kate questions how The Room manages to grant their&nbsp;
wishes, but Matt tells her not to worry about it.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.160
For the following days, their fun&nbsp;
and lavishness know no bounds.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.560
Every time they make a wish, lights flicker,&nbsp;
and so does the power source in the basement.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.800
They celebrate their overnight wealth by partying&nbsp;
together inside The Room with drinks and gifts.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.280
However, the fun and action do not last long. Kate&nbsp;
wakes up the following morning feeling empty as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.360
the material things fail to fill a void inside&nbsp;
her. Matt gets concerned about it and surprises&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.520
her with a crib, hinting that they should try&nbsp;
to have a baby. Contrary to his expectations,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.840
Kate gets upset about the surprise as she already&nbsp;
had two miscarriages and storms out of the house.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.040
Later, Kate returns inside and spontaneously&nbsp;
wishes for a child inside the mysterious Room.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.120
As Matt learns about it, he gets mad that she&nbsp;
did not consult him before wishing for a baby.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.120
Both get into a heated argument, Kate claiming&nbsp;
that she did it as a "shortcut" to motherhood.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.560
Without the possibility of a miscarriage&nbsp;
and the pain of childbirth, Kate explains&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.920
that they could be happy that way. Matt&nbsp;
is utterly against the idea and urges&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.200
Kate to bring the baby back to The Room&nbsp;
to wish for the child's disappearance.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.520
At that moment, the couple enters The Room,&nbsp;
but Kate tearfully refuses to give up the baby.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:35.760
Instead, she hands the baby over to Matt,&nbsp;
but he, could not carry out the deed as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.200
He could not get himself to wish for the baby&nbsp;
to disappear and returns it to his wife before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.840
walking away. Eventually, both of them decide to&nbsp;
keep the baby, and they become parents overnight.

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.400
While on his desk, Matt spots his unfinished&nbsp;
drawing of John Doe and does more research about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.400
the incident that happened decades ago. He learns&nbsp;
that the suspected murderer is still alive in a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.960
psychiatric hospital. In another archived news&nbsp;
article, John Doe says that The Room made him do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:01.600
it. Not long after, Matt drives to the psychiatric&nbsp;
institution to meet with John in person and ask&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:06.640
about The Room. At his arrival, a nurse warns&nbsp;
Matt that no one has visited John in 45 years,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.280
except for news reporters, so&nbsp;
Matt enlists himself as one.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:14.240
Finally, Matt comes face-to-face with a much older&nbsp;
John and starts questioning him about the house,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:18.640
especially the mysterious room. Displaying a&nbsp;
sinister smile on his face, John tells Matt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:22.160
that he has been waiting for this moment for a&nbsp;
long time. When Matt asks why John killed the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.480
Shaeffers, John tells him that was the only way.&nbsp;
John brushes off the topic and instructs Matt to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:31.200
leave the house instead. He warns the young man to&nbsp;
do it as soon as possible before it is too late.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.400
Before leaving, John says: "the only&nbsp;
thing more dangerous than a person&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.800
who can't get what they want is the&nbsp;
person who gets whatever they want."

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:42.160
Matt stops by a gas station on the way home,&nbsp;
but to his surprise, his cash turns into dust.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.360
Because of this, he rushes home and throws&nbsp;
away the remaining money in The Room to see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.360
if it will turn out the same. Then, he tries&nbsp;
to bring the Van Gogh painting by the door,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.520
confirming his theory that they cannot bring the&nbsp;
things outside, or else it will turn into dust.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:58.000
In a fit of rage, Matt breaks the walls to know&nbsp;
the mystery behind The Room, but to no avail.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.960
He only sees the intertwined sets of&nbsp;
wires that are too difficult to track.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:05.120
Matt then tears a wallpaper and discovers a map&nbsp;
of the house with guides of the connected wires.

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:09.680
Meanwhile, Kate brings the baby outside,&nbsp;
but Matt stops her, warning that it isn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.920
safe. He doesn’t tell his wife the real reason&nbsp;
why they shouldn’t bring the child outside.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:18.400
Not long after, the baby screams uncontrollably,&nbsp;
as if it is in pain. While hearing it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.160
Matt has second thoughts about helping Kate and&nbsp;
the baby, but he eventually comes to their rescue.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:27.440
Outdoors, the baby mysteriously ages to a young&nbsp;
child in a matter of seconds. Once they reenter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.640
the house, the couple could not believe what is&nbsp;
in front of them while looking at the grown boy.

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.720
Later that day, Matt reveals that The Room&nbsp;
can grant anything that their heart desires,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:39.040
but under the condition that they cannot bring it&nbsp;
outside. If they do, the thing ages and turns into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:42.960
dust. Kate replies that a baby is not a thing&nbsp;
and is unaccepting that she cannot bring their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:47.440
son outside. She becomes fond of the boy who&nbsp;
she claims to be her son and names him, Shane.

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:53.200
For the next few days, Kate home schools Shane and&nbsp;
explains that he cannot leave home because of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:57.920
dangerous germs outside. One day, Shane becomes&nbsp;
impatient while Kate teaches him how to read,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:01.840
causing him to throw a tantrum. His whole&nbsp;
life, Shane has never experienced how it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.960
is to be outside; all he has ever known is&nbsp;
the walls of the home he can never leave.

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:09.760
Later, Kate receives a package outside and&nbsp;
locks the door whenever she goes in and out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:14.320
She gives the package to Matt, who ordered it,&nbsp;
and unboxes a brand new gun. Unfortunately,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:18.320
Kate leaves the front door unlocked and completely&nbsp;
forgets about it. While she is busy playing the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:22.880
piano, Shane sneakily makes his way to the front&nbsp;
door and opens it unnoticed. He sticks his hand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:27.840
outside and feels the fresh breeze, deeply curious&nbsp;
about the outdoors. Suddenly, Kate notices it and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:32.560
rushes to her son angrily. She embraces Shane,&nbsp;
relieved that he is safe and unharmed. To prevent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:36.080
Shane from sneaking out, the couple decides&nbsp;
to block every window with planks of wood.

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:40.800
That night, Kate wakes up to Shane beside&nbsp;
her bed, asking if he could sleep beside her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:44.960
The boy tells his mother that he wants to be&nbsp;
with her forever, making Kate hold him closer.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:48.160
However, her words fail to bring ease to&nbsp;
Shane's mind as he still looks worried.

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:52.480
Matt spends the next few days practicing how&nbsp;
to shoot with his newly purchased weapon.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:56.560
He then comes back home and sees Shane playing&nbsp;
with a snow globe inside his art studio.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:00.800
Strictly, he orders Shane to leave immediately,&nbsp;
causing the boy to drop his snow globe.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:04.480
Until now, Matt has not accepted Shane&nbsp;
as his son and acts coldly toward him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:08.320
Not long after, Kate comes in and argues about&nbsp;
Matt not acting fatherly toward their son.

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:13.200
At nightfall, Shane walks around the house and&nbsp;
sees a map that leads to the basement. He sees&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:17.200
the big power source with intertwined wires and&nbsp;
eventually ends up in The Room. Throughout the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:21.840
night, lights flicker around the house, but Matt&nbsp;
and Kate do not notice it at all. When Matt wakes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:26.240
up, he sees a new snow globe beside him and the&nbsp;
broken one from a distance. He immediately wakes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:30.160
his wife up upon noticing the flickering lights,&nbsp;
already having an idea of what’s causing it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:34.320
The couple enters The Room, and to their&nbsp;
surprise, Shane made an outdoor area inside it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:38.560
The Room that once had four corners is now a vast&nbsp;
forest where Shane enjoys building a snowman.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:42.640
Kate is completely mesmerized by the world her son&nbsp;
has created for himself and joins in with his fun.

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:47.520
On the other hand, Matt is enraged and grabs&nbsp;
Shane by the arm to bring him back inside.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:51.680
The incident causes the couple to argue whether&nbsp;
or not to permit Shane to enter The Room and play.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:56.400
Matt insists that it is dangerous, but Kate thinks&nbsp;
otherwise. While they argue, the phone rings and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:59.760
Shane answers it, despite not being allowed&nbsp;
to pick up the phone or talk to anyone else.

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:04.080
Matt grabs the phone from the boy, and to&nbsp;
his surprise, John calls and realizes that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:08.080
the couple wished for a boy. From the kitchen,&nbsp;
Kate listens to their conversation with another&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:12.560
phone and overhears their whole conversation. John&nbsp;
explains that it entails the ultimate sacrifice of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:17.520
life for Shane to go freely outside the house. If&nbsp;
Kate dies, Shane can go out and age, like everyone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:22.640
else. Over the phone, John shockingly reveals that&nbsp;
he was also a child granted by The Room. John's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:26.640
mother killed his father before forcing him, as a&nbsp;
young man, to kill her so that he could be free.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:31.920
Then, he tells Matt that he has two options: kill&nbsp;
Shane and save Kate, or kill Kate and save Shane.

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:36.640
After hearing the conversation, Kate leaves&nbsp;
home, causing Matt to worry. She attempts to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:41.200
crash the car, but she could not bring herself&nbsp;
to do so. Being alone with Shane in the house,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:44.320
Matt acts frantically and even&nbsp;
trashes his studio. Not long after,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:47.760
he prepares dinner for Shane, who sits&nbsp;
across from him in the dining room.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:52.400
The curious boy keeps asking him questions, and&nbsp;
with his growing annoyance, Matt loses his cool.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:57.200
Shane is told that he is not a real boy, and he&nbsp;
does not have parents. Still, in a fit of rage,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:00.560
Matt drags Shane by the front door, but&nbsp;
the boy runs back upstairs out of fear.

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:05.920
In Shane's Room, Matt realizes that he hurt&nbsp;
him and sincerely apologizes for his actions.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:10.400
The boy asks if Matt could read to him, and they&nbsp;
end up sleeping beside each other. As Kate arrives&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:14.160
home, she is still confused by her emotions,&nbsp;
but the sight of Matt and Shane lying beside&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:18.880
each other brings her peace. Later that night, the&nbsp;
couple shares an intimate moment as Shane watches.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:22.560
The boy waits for his parents to fall asleep and&nbsp;
steals the key to the front door once they do.

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:27.120
The following day, Matt and Kate discover that&nbsp;
Shane went outside after seeing the front door&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:31.040
open. In another area of the house, they are&nbsp;
stunned to see Shane age overnight though he still&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:35.760
has the mind of a boy. He now appears to be a&nbsp;
grown man and even holds his parents at gunpoint.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:40.000
Once Kate gets him to calm down, Matt throws&nbsp;
himself at Shane and the two get into a fight.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.440
Being thrown onto the floor because of the&nbsp;
brawl, Kate slowly loses her consciousness.

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:48.960
Moments later, Kate wakes up to Matt, informing&nbsp;
her that Shane died after being accidentally shot.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:52.800
Devastated, Kate goes out and breaks into&nbsp;
tears, unable to cope with Shane's death.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:56.480
Matt comforts and carries her back into&nbsp;
the house, where she continues to grieve.

00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:00.640
Back in the room where the fight happened, the&nbsp;
real Matt gains consciousness and looks for his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:05.440
wife around the house. Still, in a state of panic,&nbsp;
he notices flickering lights and gets under the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:10.080
idea that Kate and Shane, who has shape-shifted&nbsp;
into Matt, are inside. All the while, Kate is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:14.400
still clueless about Shane being the one in front&nbsp;
of her instead of Matt. However, she realizes the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:17.840
truth of the person's identity in front of her&nbsp;
after Shane makes one of his habits of eating ice.

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:21.760
Matt tries to make his way inside The Room&nbsp;
with all his will by breaking the wall and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:26.640
passing through all the wires. He finally reaches&nbsp;
The Room, which is now a forest full of woods.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:31.120
It reveals that Shane used The Room to enlarge the&nbsp;
outdoor area and duplicate the house inside it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:33.520
He shape-shifted into Matt to&nbsp;
kidnap Kate to the cloned home&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:35.120
and take advantage of her in a sensual way.

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:39.280
Determined to claim his wife back, Matt runs&nbsp;
through the woods and finally arrives at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:43.440
cloned home. He breaks in just as Shane&nbsp;
forces himself on Kate in his bedroom.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:46.640
After hearing Matt break-in, Shane&nbsp;
gets up to prepare for another fight.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:50.640
This allows Kate to get up and leave, but she&nbsp;
sees two versions of Matt across the hallway.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:54.720
Her dilemma at the moment is beyond compare as the&nbsp;
two have an uncanny resemblance. One of them grabs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:58.720
her by the hand, but she pushes him after calling&nbsp;
out Shane's name, which grabs his attention.

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:02.960
Shane loses his consciousness after falling&nbsp;
down the stairs and transforms into his real&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:06.800
appearance. Meanwhile, Matt and Kate cannot&nbsp;
get out of the Room because Shane keeps&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:10.960
wishing for them to be trapped inside. After&nbsp;
countless tries of arriving at the same place,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:15.040
Matt stops and thinks of a way out. The couple&nbsp;
comes face to face with Shane by the door,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:19.680
who advances at Matt and stabs him to death.&nbsp;
Afterward, Shane comforts Kate but realizes that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:24.080
they are just clones and replications of the real&nbsp;
ones. Matt and Kate quickly run to The Room's exit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:27.840
through the woods while being chased by Shane,&nbsp;
who grows more aggressive after being tricked.

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:32.720
At the real home, Shane attacks Matt but is pulled&nbsp;
with him outside. Realizing that it will cost&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:37.360
his life, Shane runs back to the door, but Kate&nbsp;
immediately closes it before he could get inside.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:42.320
Shane screams, "mommy!" while Kate looks at&nbsp;
him as he ages into an elderly man. He walks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:46.080
slowly as his body decays and eventually&nbsp;
turns into dust. Despite his faults,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:50.320
Kate still cries over his body, having spent a&nbsp;
significant amount of time with him as her son.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:53.360
At that moment, the couple clings to&nbsp;
each other after a traumatizing day.

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:57.360
A month later, they move into a&nbsp;
smaller place and settle in peace.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:01.200
But not for long—Kate looks in horror at&nbsp;
her pregnancy test that comes out positive,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:04.880
unsure if the baby belongs to Matt or&nbsp;
Shane. As if things are not bad enough,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:08.800
a lamp flickers, and she gets under the impression&nbsp;
that all along, they might still be in The Room.

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:13.680
In the story, Matt and Kate have completely been&nbsp;
blinded by the riches that The Room has to offer.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:16.800
With the unexplained magic, they become&nbsp;
more careless with their desires,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:20.320
even wishing for a child after a series&nbsp;
of miscarriages. The flickering light at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:23.760
their new apartment at the end gives a slim&nbsp;
possibility of them still being in The Room,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:27.760
or a glitch in the building may also cause it.&nbsp;
Among the most shocking revelations is Kate's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:31.920
pregnancy which could be Matt's or Shane's child.&nbsp;
The night before the big incident, Kate and Matt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:36.320
made love, but the grown Shane also assaulted her&nbsp;
in the cloned home. The mystery of the film does&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:40.480
not only revolve around the wish-granting Room&nbsp;
but, finally, the father of Kate's unborn child.
