00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:07.360
hello everybody welcome to my channel today i am&nbsp;
going to explain an inspirational true story film&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:11.280
called something the lord made&nbsp;
it's the story of dr vivian thomas&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.640
how a man who studied only up to high school made&nbsp;
his valuable contribution to the field of medicine&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:23.280
the story of the film begins in the late 1920s&nbsp;
in that era the discrimination based on color&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:28.080
in america was at its peak young vivien&nbsp;
thomas was working as a carpenter in an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.400
under construction building he was a high&nbsp;
school student who wanted to go to college&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.640
he was working for his college tuition fees his&nbsp;
father was also a carpenter taught in very well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.240
one day his supervisor comes to him pays his&nbsp;
daily wages and says that you do good work&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:50.320
but i have to support the other workers too as&nbsp;
they have a family he then fires him now a friend&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.120
of vivian tells him about a new job at a lab run&nbsp;
by one young surgeon named dr alfred blaylock&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.200
dr blaylock speaks to vivian and says we&nbsp;
do medical research on shock in this lab&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.040
we bring dogs from a nearby dog house experiment&nbsp;
on them study their conditions and publish our&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:13.040
results you have to clean the lab daily feed&nbsp;
the dogs on time and walk them so we need a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.920
janitor here the shock is a body condition&nbsp;
in which blood circulation in the body stops&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.800
many organs don't get sufficient blood in&nbsp;
time due to which multi-organ failure occurs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:29.280
allergic reactions blood loss heart failure blood&nbsp;
infections dehydration poisoning are some of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:36.160
causes of shock vivian accepts that job now while&nbsp;
working in the lab vivian reads all medical books&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.920
he learns all the procedure to conduct the&nbsp;
experiments he has now completed high school&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.280
but still had no money to go to college so&nbsp;
he continues his work at the lab dr blaylock&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:53.920
also notices his interest and he encourages him&nbsp;
actively dr blaylock teaches him all procedures&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.320
in a few months he starts doing the entire&nbsp;
experiments of the lab on his own conducting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.880
them noting the results and filing the report in&nbsp;
between vivian marries clara when his life was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:11.040
going well on september 29 1929 the u.s stock&nbsp;
market crashes and the great depression begins&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.120
the bank in which he kept all of his&nbsp;
college money goes under bankruptcy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.120
his plan to go to college was also over now&nbsp;
vivian's father brother harold and the rest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.680
of the family members actively supports&nbsp;
him for the next many years vivian and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.000
dr blaylock worked together in the lab and&nbsp;
continued to conduct the systematic research&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.520
dr blaylock now had full confidence in vivian's&nbsp;
knowledge and skills that's why he started acting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:41.360
as a supervisor dr blaylock gives a white coat&nbsp;
to vivian symbolizing that he is equal to a lab&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:48.480
technician in experience after the 1941 attack&nbsp;
on pearl harbor the united states goes to war dr&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.120
blaylock's research proves to be quite useful to&nbsp;
treat soldiers who are suffering from shock due to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:59.200
bleeding dr blaylock now gets the top job of chief&nbsp;
of surgery at the famous medical research hospital&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:06.000
johns hopkins he and vivian now go from nashville&nbsp;
to baltimore baltimore was a broken cosmopolitan&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.920
inflation was too high vivian and clara were&nbsp;
having trouble getting into this big city&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:18.160
baltimore was infamous at that time for racism dr&nbsp;
blaylock and vivian when they go to hospital from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.240
the front door the doctor shows him the portraits&nbsp;
of all the great doctors in the hall of fame&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.680
there there was a portrait of johns hopkins&nbsp;
himself who started the hospital sir william&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.800
osler the father of american medicine it is&nbsp;
only then that the hospital security says that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:38.160
black people are supposed to come from the back&nbsp;
door dr blaylock tries to convince him but fails&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:43.280
on his first day at work vivian wears his&nbsp;
white coat and walks like a regular guy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.600
everyone at the hospital feels astonished in&nbsp;
their entire life they never saw a colored man&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:53.280
walking with a white coat so far colored people&nbsp;
used to be janitors there were no black doctors&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:59.120
no black technicians vivian was the first&nbsp;
official black lab technician since he had&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.600
no official degree of a lab technician the&nbsp;
hospital allotted him the job classification&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:08.720
of janitor only like the rest of the other&nbsp;
black staff vivian initially didn't know that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:14.160
in the meantime claire complains that baltimore is&nbsp;
way more expensive where it is getting difficult&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:20.080
for her and her children to adjust vivian says dr&nbsp;
blaylock had received offers from many hospitals&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:24.320
but he refused many of them because they&nbsp;
did not want him he says when i started&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:29.120
working i was just a janitor but today i am&nbsp;
the lab assistant to the chief of surgery in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.600
one of the country's best hospitals he&nbsp;
convinces clara to adjust to a new life&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:39.120
to earn extra money he starts to do all odd jobs&nbsp;
he can like working as a plumber in his apartment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:45.440
as a waiter at dr blaylock's parties during one&nbsp;
such party dr blaylock meets dr helen taussig&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:51.440
dr helen was a pediatrician and had many&nbsp;
cases with blue baby syndrome blue baby&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:57.200
syndrome occurs in newborn babies where their body&nbsp;
color turns to blue hemoglobin is responsible for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:03.280
transporting oxygen to body cells when hemoglobin&nbsp;
is low in blood the skin color turns to be blue&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.840
the main reason for hemoglobin deficiency is low&nbsp;
blood oxygen babies with defective heart anatomy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:14.880
cause blue baby syndrome in them in an easy&nbsp;
language there are two parts in a normal heart&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.680
the left side and the right side both&nbsp;
sides are separated by a fine membrane&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:25.200
the heart is basically a pump which always pumps&nbsp;
blood all the oxygenated blood coming from the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:30.080
body first goes to the right side of the heart&nbsp;
from there it gets pumped into the lungs when we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:35.440
inhale the oxygen from the nose it goes to the&nbsp;
lungs in lungs the chemical exchange happens&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:42.080
oxygen enters the blood and carbon dioxide goes&nbsp;
out this oxidized blood from the lungs goes to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:47.200
left part of the heart from there it gets pumped&nbsp;
to rest on the body these processes continue&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.320
there are four main reasons for different&nbsp;
heart condition in blue baby patients&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:56.400
one of the main reasons is caused by a hole in the&nbsp;
membrane that separates the left from the right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:01.200
when there is a hole in the membrane some part of&nbsp;
the blood which gets pumped to the lungs from the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:07.200
right side flows directly to the left side this&nbsp;
is to oxygenated blood hence it carries no oxygen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:12.400
when such blood is pumped from the left side&nbsp;
to the rest of the body it reduces the overall&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:20.240
oxygen level dr helen forces dr blaylock to accept&nbsp;
this challenge until 1940 surgery on the heart was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:25.280
written off the popular belief in the medical&nbsp;
fraternity was in order to conduct a surgery&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.840
you have to stop the heart for at least&nbsp;
three minutes by that time the patient dies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:35.280
hence it was taught in all the medical schools&nbsp;
not to touch the heart dr helen recently got a new&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:42.560
case daughter of mr and mrs saxon she was already&nbsp;
a pale blue color she didn't have much time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:48.640
now vivian and dr blaylock start their research&nbsp;
first they want to induce the effect of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:53.840
blue baby syndrome in a healthy dog study its&nbsp;
effects and after that find the surgical cure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:59.920
after america entered world war ii in 1941&nbsp;
hospitals filled up with injured soldiers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:05.760
dr blaylock was too busy in regular operations&nbsp;
hence he was not able to give much time to medical&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:10.960
research all the responsibility of conducting&nbsp;
heavy research fell on the shoulders of vivian&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:17.760
vivian now starts to study the heart defect of&nbsp;
blue baby it was no easy task to induce the exact&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:23.200
effect of blue baby syndrome in a healthy&nbsp;
dog it took 7 months and 200 unsuccessful&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:28.720
dogs to arrive at the solution vivian was no&nbsp;
veterinary doctor but due to his experience with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:34.080
dogs in nashville he was able to successfully&nbsp;
induce that effect he invented many surgical&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:39.360
instruments many surgical techniques he worked&nbsp;
10 to 12 hours a day he was so well versed with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:44.160
dog treatment that a local dog house asked him to&nbsp;
volunteer every weekend to do the surgery on dogs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:50.000
dr longmore who was a resident of dr blaylock also&nbsp;
wished to learn all these new techniques from him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:55.840
in the meantime one day vivian's elder brother&nbsp;
harold thomas comes to baltimore to pay a visit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:55.840 --> 00:08:01.920
to him harold was fighting a case against the&nbsp;
school board in the u.s supreme court his lawyer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:06.320
was legendary thurgood marshall thurgood&nbsp;
marshall later went on to become the first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:13.120
black supreme court judge in 1967 at that time&nbsp;
school teachers were not paid equally in the u.s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:18.800
there was discrimination in payment based on color&nbsp;
after 12 years of legal battle the judgment was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:24.400
about to come harold advised vivian to go back to&nbsp;
nashville he wanted him to quit that dead-end job&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:31.040
vivian politely reasons it out on knowing his job&nbsp;
classification and salary are the same as that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:36.720
of other janitors vivian gets furious he demands&nbsp;
from dr blaylock that he should be given a higher&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:43.520
salary a job classification of a lab technician he&nbsp;
threatens to quit the job and go back to nashville&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:49.440
dr blaylock talks with the chairman of the&nbsp;
hospital the hospital finally agrees to hire&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:55.680
vivian as a lab technician ignoring all hiring&nbsp;
rules now dr blaylock suggests a new method to get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:55.680 --> 00:09:00.800
more oxygen in the blood he says the blood that&nbsp;
comes from the left side of the heart if we rewire&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:04.880
it to the right side through a stunt then we can&nbsp;
give more oxygen to the right side of the heart&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:10.240
then the right side of the heart will pump&nbsp;
more blood to the lungs once the lungs start&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:17.040
exchanging more oxygen more oxygen will circulate&nbsp;
in the body vivian now tries this new method after&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:21.840
a few days of hard work and failure finally he&nbsp;
was able to create more oxygen in the dog's body&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:27.920
dr blaylock checks that and says did you really&nbsp;
do that vivian it looked like something the lord&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:34.240
made now dr blaylock and vidian explained their&nbsp;
research to dr helen all the three now do the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:39.680
same experiment on another dog this time dr&nbsp;
blaylock performs the surgery while vivian&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:45.120
standing next to him explains all the procedures&nbsp;
in detail the operation was successful and now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:50.400
they were ready to perform the same operation&nbsp;
on a saxon baby dr blaylock now explains the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:56.320
procedure to mr and mrs saxon and all the risks&nbsp;
associated with it since there was no other option&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:56.320 --> 00:10:02.720
they agreed for the operation dr blaylock asks&nbsp;
his resident doctors dr longmore and dr cooley&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:08.080
to assist him and dr helen in the surgery on the&nbsp;
day of the operation all the other doctors of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:13.040
hospital administrative board members chairman&nbsp;
everybody comes to see this complex procedure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:17.840
everything was right on the operation table&nbsp;
but dr blaylock starts to feel uncomfortable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:24.560
so he asks his assistant dr longmore to bring&nbsp;
vivian to ot after checking dr longmore informs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:29.680
dr blaylock that the hospital administration&nbsp;
is not allowing vivian into ot as he is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:35.760
not a doctor or a nurse dr blaylock furiously&nbsp;
announces on public mic to vivian to come to ot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:41.040
when he arrives at the ot dr blaylock tells&nbsp;
him to stand beside him and instruct him all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:46.640
the procedures step by step vivian does the same&nbsp;
when dr blaylock connects the left side of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:52.240
heart to the right side of the heart the baby skin&nbsp;
color starts to change from blue to pink everybody&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:58.320
in the room starts to rejoice it was the first&nbsp;
successful heart operation in the world everyone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:03.920
saks and parents the staff dr blaylock was happy&nbsp;
dr blaylock appreciates the skills of vivian&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:09.600
in the newspapers in time magazine articles were&nbsp;
written about the first successful heart operation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:15.840
but the name of vivian thomas was nowhere dr&nbsp;
blaylock and dr helen were credited with the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:21.680
discovery of the stunt hence it was named after&nbsp;
them bt stunt clara gives some solace to vivian&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:25.680
the cure for blue baby&nbsp;
syndrome spread like a wildfire&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:32.000
the hospital was flooded with patients dr&nbsp;
blaylock and vivian conduct hundreds of operations&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:37.840
doctors from all over the world observes&nbsp;
the operation at the white only felicitation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:41.840
function dr blaylock was felicitated and&nbsp;
thanked by many donors of the hospital&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:48.640
dr blaylock acknowledges everybody's contribution&nbsp;
but vivian's vivian was attending that function as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:52.880
a waiter he hoped that at least dr blaylock&nbsp;
would appreciate his contribution publicly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:57.360
knowing that now that was not going to&nbsp;
happen the next day he resigns from his job&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:03.680
dr blaylock tries to convince him he says he was&nbsp;
not responsible for not allowing the function&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:10.240
he was not responsible for all the racism in the&nbsp;
society but vivian was adamant he felt let down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:16.960
so he finally resigned now vivian starts to work&nbsp;
as a medical representative all the black doctors&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:22.400
who knew vivian from the operation try to help him&nbsp;
as best they can after some time vivian and clara&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:27.920
visit their parents in nashville harold was also&nbsp;
there he won his famous case at the supreme court&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:33.440
after some time vivian says to clara that&nbsp;
his mind is still in that lab of dr blaylock&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:40.240
his life work is there in that lab so he has&nbsp;
