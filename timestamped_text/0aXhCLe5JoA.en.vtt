00:00:05.717 --> 00:00:06.869
hey what's up guys

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:11.093
today I'll show you a science fiction comedy film, "Idiocracy"

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:13.909
spoiler ahead, watch out and take care

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:19.989
someday in the future, while technologies for mass production are developed at top speed 

00:00:20.053 --> 00:00:21.077
and reach their peak

00:00:21.397 --> 00:00:25.109
human civilization however, evolves in the opposite direction

00:00:25.941 --> 00:00:28.949
facing no competition for food and other resources

00:00:29.141 --> 00:00:32.597
people change their mindset towards reproduction gradually

00:00:33.109 --> 00:00:37.141
those elites who get high IQs tend to have fewer kids or even no kids

00:00:37.525 --> 00:00:41.109
on the contrary, those with IQs below the average

00:00:41.237 --> 00:00:43.477
tend to have more kids without any birth control 

00:00:43.925 --> 00:00:47.061
such population pattern continues for hundreds of years

00:00:48.341 --> 00:00:51.029
Joe works as a librarian at a military base

00:00:51.157 --> 00:00:55.253
labeled as the most average individual in the entire armed forces

00:00:55.381 --> 00:00:59.575
he's lucky enough to be chosen to join the first so-called human hibernation project

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.650
for the only reason that he lives alone without any family members

00:01:04.048 --> 00:01:08.528
because of that, no one would care for him and hold the army for responsibility

00:01:08.656 --> 00:01:12.432
even if the project proves to be a failure sometime in the future

00:01:13.136 --> 00:01:18.000
Rita who's a notorious street prostitute and also has no family member

00:01:18.128 --> 00:01:20.432
decides to join the first experiment

00:01:20.816 --> 00:01:24.848
believing it's a good way to escape the exploitation by her pimp boyfriend

00:01:24.976 --> 00:01:29.904
who would rather give her up in exchange for a legal permit to his procuring business 

00:01:30.032 --> 00:01:31.888
issued by the project Chief

00:01:32.528 --> 00:01:35.600
Joe and Rita are brought into the hibernation chambers 

00:01:35.728 --> 00:01:40.272
and begin their hibernation journey originally set to someday of one year later

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.392
not long after that however, the experiment project is suspended 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.656
for the business scandal between the project Chief and the pimp guy 

00:01:48.784 --> 00:01:50.384
 is exposed to the public

00:01:50.832 --> 00:01:55.184
due to the scandal, the Chief is arrested with his hibernation project abandoned 

00:01:55.632 --> 00:01:58.960
the experiment chambers are just left forgotten since then

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.864
while Joe and Rita are buried underground for their long dormancy

00:02:04.016 --> 00:02:07.728
meanwhile, on the ground, humanity is under dramatic change

00:02:07.856 --> 00:02:11.888
as the number of uncivilized population surges to its record high

00:02:12.272 --> 00:02:15.600
the population average IQ level is on the fall continuously

00:02:16.112 --> 00:02:19.824
ironically to a point where humans could not produce enough products 

00:02:19.952 --> 00:02:21.168
to support their basic demands

00:02:21.488 --> 00:02:25.392
what's more, they don't even know how to get rid of their wastes and trashes

00:02:25.712 --> 00:02:29.232
resulting in the piling-up of numerous trash mountains in the city

00:02:30.128 --> 00:02:36.400
someday in 2025, a huge trash-mountain slide happens and almost crushes the whole city

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.575
which ironically happens to unearth the buried hibernation chamber 

00:02:40.812 --> 00:02:44.588
and causes Joe to awaken up in the apartment of the stupid Bob

00:02:44.716 --> 00:02:47.148
who's smart enough to figure out a real trespasser

00:02:47.276 --> 00:02:49.772
and kicks Joe out right away onto the street

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.932
shocked by the modern world full of trashes though

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.748
Joe soon realizes that people living in the present

00:02:56.876 --> 00:03:01.100
speak extremely bad English, probably far more broken than this channel

00:03:04.044 --> 00:03:06.732
Joe begins to doubt himself a little bit however

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.468
soon after he learns that his English actually sounds ridiculous to the locals

00:03:12.428 --> 00:03:14.540
still confused a ton by the surroundings

00:03:14.668 --> 00:03:19.532
Joe tries to comfort himself from the chaos for some kind of hallucination reason

00:03:19.916 --> 00:03:23.884
so he finds his way to a local hospital for a mental health check

00:03:24.332 --> 00:03:26.956
but only to get astonished by the insane hospital

00:03:27.084 --> 00:03:31.884
where the doctor seems insanely stupid, and needs be sent for a mental check instead

00:03:32.844 --> 00:03:35.020
while feeling lost by the stupid crowd

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.140
he becomes to know from the newspaper that he is in a future world of 500 years later 

00:03:40.972 --> 00:03:44.748
as he looks through the window, he's shocked again by the totally-mess-up city

00:03:45.836 --> 00:03:49.164
after the health check, Joe is asked to pay the bill 

00:03:49.356 --> 00:03:54.348
however, upon discovering that Joe bears no mandatory ID bar code on his hand

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.612
the doctor triggers the security alarm immediately

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:01.900
attempting to catch such an unbelievably insane patient and report to the government

00:04:02.668 --> 00:04:05.612
In a great panic, Joe rushes out of the hospital

00:04:05.996 --> 00:04:09.260
when back to the street, rather than a hallucination

00:04:09.452 --> 00:04:13.292
Joe realizes the stupids have completely taken over the whole world

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.068
people are starving and struggling through the trash

00:04:17.388 --> 00:04:20.972
and the economic engine seems to have long since powered off

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.708
in the evening, as Joe is searching the auto-seller machine for food

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.780
the police show up in seconds and take control of him

00:04:29.484 --> 00:04:33.836
he's later brought to the local court, presumably a serious place for law and order

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.356
which however, turns to be a pretty damned good place 

00:04:37.484 --> 00:04:39.660
for verbal and physical abuse on the suspect

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.860
in despair of the abusing audience though

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:47.468
Joe gets more desperate to find his defense lawyer is actually the stupid Bob 

00:04:47.468 --> 00:04:49.500
who just kicked him the other day

00:04:50.353 --> 00:04:53.745
trying hard to defend himself before the stupid jury though

00:04:53.873 --> 00:04:57.329
as expected, Joe is sentenced guilty for his behavior

00:04:57.969 --> 00:05:01.425
as a routine procedure, Joe is taken to the IQ test 

00:05:01.553 --> 00:05:03.473
before he is later sent into the prison

00:05:03.985 --> 00:05:08.017
where however, with his slightly smart trick played to the prison guard

00:05:08.145 --> 00:05:11.345
Joe easily frees himself and flees out 

00:05:12.241 --> 00:05:15.505
in the escape, Joe finds the stupid lawyer Bob

00:05:15.697 --> 00:05:18.257
and asks him whether there is some kind of time machine

00:05:18.385 --> 00:05:20.625
 that can make him travel back to the past

00:05:21.265 --> 00:05:26.065
Bob pauses for a while long enough for him to understand the word "time machine"

00:05:26.257 --> 00:05:28.753
before he finally admits that he may know a "thing"

00:05:29.393 --> 00:05:32.401
Joe further tricks Bob to believe that the time machine 

00:05:32.529 --> 00:05:34.257
is actually the money-making machine 

00:05:34.577 --> 00:05:37.329
which motivates Bob to use his brain to do him the favor 

00:05:38.225 --> 00:05:41.425
but at that time, they both have to run out of the apartment 

00:05:41.553 --> 00:05:44.049
as the police approach near and break in

00:05:45.201 --> 00:05:50.129
in the following escape, Joe happens to find the street girl Rita on the damned right street

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:53.725
who's just awakened from the dormancy chamber and wandering there

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:59.649
intending to remake her old business with such IQ-counter-high, but hormone-low idiots

00:05:59.905 --> 00:06:01.249
but to no avail

00:06:02.657 --> 00:06:06.049
with no better place to go, Rita joins them on the run

00:06:06.753 --> 00:06:09.185
Joe is spotted out soon by the monitor

00:06:09.505 --> 00:06:13.089
what's worse, they have to abandon the car running out of gas

00:06:13.281 --> 00:06:15.009
and find shelter somewhere else

00:06:16.033 --> 00:06:19.105
before they walk far away, the police approach the car

00:06:19.297 --> 00:06:21.217
and open fire at it immediately

00:06:21.473 --> 00:06:23.329
which cheers up the beholders

00:06:24.033 --> 00:06:26.849
Joe and Rita later follow Bob to a building

00:06:27.041 --> 00:06:28.449
waiting for the subway

00:06:28.897 --> 00:06:30.753
the automatic scanning detects Joe

00:06:30.945 --> 00:06:32.737
he insists on going with Rita 

00:06:32.865 --> 00:06:35.169
but misses the chance to get away with Bob

00:06:35.617 --> 00:06:37.857
leading to his being confined by the police

00:06:38.817 --> 00:06:41.889
moments later, instead of being sent back to the prison this time

00:06:42.017 --> 00:06:44.001
Joe is taken to the White House instead 

00:06:44.513 --> 00:06:48.033
where to his surprise, the President gives him a warm welcome

00:06:48.161 --> 00:06:50.081
and nominates him as the Minister 

00:06:50.913 --> 00:06:53.665
that's because people get to know from his former IQ test 

00:06:53.793 --> 00:06:57.633
that Joe is actually the one with the highest IQs remaining on this planet

00:06:58.465 --> 00:07:01.537
he is treated as a savior to this country of fools right now

00:07:01.729 --> 00:07:05.569
but in exchange, Joe is demanded to solve the food shortage

00:07:05.697 --> 00:07:08.961
seemingly the current most emergent issue burning their ass

00:07:09.857 --> 00:07:12.801
with no choice, Joe has to take the mission first 

00:07:12.993 --> 00:07:15.297
but he never stops his plan to run away

00:07:16.257 --> 00:07:21.441
he finds the stupid Bob later and pushes him to continue his effort in the time machine

00:07:22.081 --> 00:07:24.833
he also finds the street girl Rita from the street

00:07:25.217 --> 00:07:27.585
and holds a secret talk with her in a research field

00:07:28.225 --> 00:07:32.449
he instructs Rita to locate the time machine with a road map given by Bob 

00:07:32.897 --> 00:07:37.953
but only finds that it's a stupid road map impossible for people with average IQ to read

00:07:38.465 --> 00:07:40.897
because of that, they have to give up the escape plan

00:07:41.857 --> 00:07:44.161
on their way back from the research mission however

00:07:44.417 --> 00:07:48.193
Joe happens to find the vegetables are actually watered with soft drinks

00:07:48.449 --> 00:07:50.817
which would definitely impede the growth of plants

00:07:51.329 --> 00:07:56.325
to Joe's shock, the soft drinks have been sold everywhere as pure water for all industries

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:58.625
due to the lobby of the monopoly company 

00:07:58.913 --> 00:08:02.241
who has bought off the government officials and even the reporters

00:08:03.137 --> 00:08:05.953
Joe proposes that the plant shall be grown with pure water

00:08:06.145 --> 00:08:08.961
but gets refused by all other stupid ministers

00:08:09.217 --> 00:08:12.993
who are smart enough to figure out pure water is not their taste

00:08:13.697 --> 00:08:17.601
Joe then changes his strategy by lying that he can actually talk to the plants

00:08:17.857 --> 00:08:20.033
and the plants beg humans for fresh water

00:08:20.737 --> 00:08:24.193
in that way, Joe gets his proposal approved immediately 

00:08:25.217 --> 00:08:26.753
not long after that however

00:08:26.881 --> 00:08:31.105
 such a proposal causes the soft drink company to suffer a great loss 

00:08:31.361 --> 00:08:34.177
and a huge drop of its stock price in the stock market

00:08:34.497 --> 00:08:38.145
which in return, makes half of its employees lose their jobs

00:08:38.913 --> 00:08:41.921
the rampaging demonstrators soon surround the White House

00:08:42.561 --> 00:08:46.273
under huge pressure, the President has to send Joe to prison

00:08:46.401 --> 00:08:47.873
believing that he's a liar

00:08:49.345 --> 00:08:51.905
Joe is later sent to the public arena as a punishment

00:08:52.225 --> 00:08:55.297
all other racers, bore with low IQs though 

00:08:55.489 --> 00:08:58.817
are well armed with powerful weapons and deadly monsters

00:08:59.265 --> 00:09:02.721
in contrast, Joe is given only a shabby car

00:09:03.681 --> 00:09:07.521
despite that, he manages to beat them down with his high IQs

00:09:07.777 --> 00:09:13.075
the following rival is a stupid but tough guy holding a more powerful weapon

00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:17.800
without any weapons to fight back, Joe has to run and hide

00:09:18.114 --> 00:09:21.250
while trying to make the audience believe what he did is right

00:09:21.442 --> 00:09:22.594
but to no avail

00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:25.730
fortunately, at the critical moment

00:09:25.858 --> 00:09:28.994
the fighting is interrupted by a live stream on the big screen

00:09:29.186 --> 00:09:32.706
which shows some vegetable seeds start to sprout out of the dirt

00:09:33.474 --> 00:09:36.738
it's shown that the live stream is made by Rita and Bob

00:09:36.994 --> 00:09:39.490
who pay a camera guy to film the sprouts

00:09:39.618 --> 00:09:42.882
and distract the broadcasting guy away with hormone

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:46.914
allowing her to connect the live stream successfully to the big screen

00:09:48.130 --> 00:09:49.666
upon seeing the green sprouts

00:09:49.794 --> 00:09:54.850
the whole silent audience become to exclaim and applaud for Joe and his success

00:09:55.554 --> 00:09:58.818
the excited President announces to free Joe right away

00:09:59.010 --> 00:10:01.954
and decides to promote him to be the Deputy President

00:10:02.658 --> 00:10:07.010
Joe however, still hopes to travel back to his world with the time machine

00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:12.002
but eventually, he decides to settle down with Rita in such a world of fools

00:10:12.194 --> 00:10:16.546
after he's desperate to know that the time machine found by the stupid Bob at last

00:10:16.674 --> 00:10:19.746
is actually an amusement park named "time masheen" 

00:10:20.514 --> 00:10:25.058
at the end of the story, Joe, as the man with highest IQs on this planet

00:10:25.186 --> 00:10:29.218
solves many fundamental survival issues for all the stupid citizens

00:10:29.986 --> 00:10:32.354
later he becomes the President of the United States 

00:10:32.482 --> 00:10:35.106
and forms a family with the street girl Rita

00:10:35.298 --> 00:10:37.986
who gives birth to three kids with the highest IQs 

00:10:38.946 --> 00:10:42.950
in contrast, the stupid lawyer Bob forms his family later

00:10:43.116 --> 00:10:47.404
but like many other stupid peers, he mass-produces 32 kids

00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:50.668
to be worse, all with the lowest IQs

00:10:51.308 --> 00:10:55.532
seemingly conveying a message that nothing on this planet will be changed in the future

00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:59.244
this's Daniel CC movie channel, Bye
