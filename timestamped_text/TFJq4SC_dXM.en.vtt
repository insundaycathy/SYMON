00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.800
a legislative body called the collective the&nbsp;
collective has set extreme rules and laws to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.840
make sure such a war does not emerge again the&nbsp;
citizens of the peninsula are called the members&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.800
and the collective monitors and controls all of&nbsp;
the members actions with a futuristic approach&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:32.400
to solving the problem everyone in the peninsula&nbsp;
is made mentally stable all emotions and diseases&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.520
have been eradicated people live an automated life&nbsp;
they do not talk to each other unless they have to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:42.880
the concept of friendship and relationship is&nbsp;
gone and any show of emotion is considered illegal&nbsp;&nbsp;

marriage is non-existent in any form of&nbsp;
sexual activity is contrary to society's rules&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:54.080
babies are born strictly through artificial&nbsp;
insemination on the other hand no one knows&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:58.640
what is in the other peninsula people assume&nbsp;
that primitive human emotions are allowed there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.280
silas is a member of the peninsula he too is&nbsp;
mentally stabilized and is void of any emotions he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.880
works as an illustrator at atmos when silas walks&nbsp;
out of his futuristic home we see that everyone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.760

spread throughout the city and everyone seems&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:21.200
to be automated as per usual he walks into his&nbsp;
workplace a voice announces a disease called&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.640
the switch down syndrome more commonly called sos&nbsp;
it is a condition in the members of the peninsula&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.800
where their mental stabilization stops working&nbsp;
and they start to get their emotions back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.400
it has four stages and is considered fatal by the&nbsp;
collective the members are daily reminded of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:42.640
effects of sos via an announcement nia isela's&nbsp;
colleague and a fellow member of the peninsula&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.920
that day at lunch the members eat in their outdoor&nbsp;
cafeteria while they engage in a conversation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:53.280
about work nia stays especially quiet while&nbsp;
returning home that night silas comes across two&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.720
guards restraining a man named david a woman who&nbsp;

their emotions back they are being taken into a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:10.720
facility called den defective emotional neuropathy&nbsp;
dn was established by the collective to hold in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:16.160
the patient suffering from sos while not many&nbsp;
people know of what occurs inside the place it is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.120
rumored that the people from the fourth stage get&nbsp;
killed mercilessly as the stage is beyond healing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.400
the display of emotions unsettles silas he then&nbsp;
comes back to his apartment and we get a full view&nbsp;&nbsp;

silas notices signs of human emotions in nia&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.760
her hands are tightened and she seems nervous he&nbsp;
notices the oddness but doesn't think much of it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.320
later they are in an auditorium watching a&nbsp;
presentation where silas cannot stop looking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:10.160

enjoying his food he doesn't play with puzzles&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:15.200

personality he dreams of his trying to commit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.320
suicide and wakes up in distress and hits his head&nbsp;
this is the first time he has ever had a nightmare&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:26.400
the following day he goes to the doctor where he&nbsp;
meets a man named jonas who is in level 2 of sos&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:32.400
the doctor checks silas and it turns out that&nbsp;
he has level 1 sos he asked the doctor if he has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.040
to go to the den but the doctor assures him&nbsp;
that cure at level one is easy and possible&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:44.320
at lunch silas again keeps staring at nia he seems&nbsp;
to be observing her facial features silas gets his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.800
medication for sos and takes it at night while&nbsp;
listening to a voice narrating the effects and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:55.200
causes of sos the voice adds that people with&nbsp;
the last stage of sos stage 4 are taken to den&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.840
and are electrocuted for showing emotions the&nbsp;
sick will go through a pain-free death scenario&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.960
the following day at work silas&nbsp;

seem to concentrate and keep staring at her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:23.440

to nia's recorded voice on her computer&nbsp;&nbsp;

he has begun falling in love with her the&nbsp;
next day silas and his team are in a meeting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:34.080
when he accidentally drops a mug of coffee he&nbsp;
admits that he is suffering from level 1 sos&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:39.120
the group collectively decides that silas should&nbsp;
stay as far as possible while working so that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:44.640
the others feel more comfortable after work as&nbsp;
nia leaves for her apartment silas follows her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.280
nia catches him in the act but silas in&nbsp;
turn questions her if she has sos too&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.760
he tells her about him noticing her demure&nbsp;
change when the guy committed suicide that week&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:54.320 --> 00:05:00.080

she is at sos for a year now she never went to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:27.760
the doctor because she was afraid of being sent&nbsp;
to the den she then tells him that their being&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:33.760
together is too risky so they can't meet like&nbsp;
this again the two get up and finally kiss it is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:39.200

into the restroom while the two are together nia&nbsp;
stays hidden while silas goes out and talks to him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:08.720
as it turns out someone had reported silas's&nbsp;
strange behavior to leonard he warned silas of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:14.720
the consequences of sneaking around and leaves the&nbsp;
two talk on their way back home and silas tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:20.320
her that he will look for another job to not get&nbsp;
caught so the next day silas resigns from his job&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:26.160
a man named dominic replaces him as silas gets&nbsp;
a new job at a nursery at night while picking up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:31.760
medicines silas meets jonas again the two talk&nbsp;
for a while and jonas reveals that he is a part&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:36.960
of a support group with people who are suffering&nbsp;
from sos he offers to help silas if he needs it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:43.600
soon silas visits the support group and meets&nbsp;
its members namely bess peter thomas gill max&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:48.480
and alice there he finds out that half the&nbsp;
patients brought to den commit suicide as the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:54.080
staff encourages them some even watch them kill&nbsp;
themselves as opposed to electoral restraints&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:54.080 --> 00:07:01.280
suicide seems more preferable to everyone silas is&nbsp;
shocked later that night nia knocks on his door he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:07.040
brings her inside and she breaks down crying she&nbsp;
had missed him too much one thing leads to another&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:12.480
and the two end up having sex from the following&nbsp;
day the two meet every night at silas's apartment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:18.960
silas has completely stopped taking his medication&nbsp;
the two are beyond happy with their lifestyle that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:23.520
is until one morning they hear the announcement&nbsp;
that a medication to treat sos has been made&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:28.000
the announcer suggests everyone who has&nbsp;
been diagnosed with sos to take the medicine&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:33.520
sos of any level can be treated with it scared&nbsp;
that they will not be able to feel anymore&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:38.720
silas and nia go to the support group they&nbsp;
have decided to run away to the other peninsula&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:42.080
best tells them that it is not a good&nbsp;
idea but they have made their decision&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:48.080
they decide to leave in three days with jonas's&nbsp;
help however nia gets a conception call from the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:53.200
collective they want her to artificially bear&nbsp;
a child if the doctor checks her blood results&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:58.560
they will diagnose her with sos scared she tells&nbsp;
this to silas who asks her to meet him at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:03.840
clinic after her appointment at the clinic&nbsp;
the doctor informs nia that she is pregnant&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:08.800
silas sees two guards taking her away but&nbsp;
he cannot do anything they take her to dn&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:14.480
silas frantically asks jonas for help who tells&nbsp;
him to go home and wait for a couple of hours&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:19.600
bess who is also a worker at den frees nia&nbsp;
and takes her to the rest of the support group&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:25.120
they make her dress up as fast as she can best&nbsp;
then explains to her that a patient named eva&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:31.600
had killed herself last night bess has changed her&nbsp;
records to nia's so now nia can live freely as eva&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:35.520
nia runs away to silas's apartment but is&nbsp;
surprised when she doesn't find him there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:40.720
meanwhile silas is at work where it is&nbsp;
announced in the news that max had reported bess&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:47.040
jonas and gilead so now all three of them were&nbsp;
cured and void of emotions he then runs to dn's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:53.120
headquarters and asks a worker about nia he&nbsp;
informs him of her death silas is devastated&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:58.080
he goes blank and starts having a panic attack nia&nbsp;
goes searching for him when he doesn't return back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:04.480
to the apartment meanwhile silas climbs on top of&nbsp;
atmos's building to commit suicide as he is about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:10.080
to jump he changes his decision when he gets back&nbsp;
to his apartment he is greeted by a worried nia&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:16.800
she immediately notices the mark on his neck&nbsp;
silas has been cured of sos nia asks him why he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:22.160
did that to which he replies that he thought she&nbsp;
was dead the cure only takes effect in six hours&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:28.000
so he only has one more hour before his emotions&nbsp;
go away nia is still pregnant so she asks silas&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:33.520
to fight the cure the two still decide to go&nbsp;
through the plan to run away the next morning&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:38.400
silas remembers that he loved her but doesn't feel&nbsp;
it anymore he tells her to get dressed to go to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:44.320
the train as they had decided in the train nia is&nbsp;
disappointed as silas sits two seats away from her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:49.600
nia reminisces of all the good times with silas&nbsp;
just then he sits on the seat beside her and holds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:55.280
her hand suggesting that he will soon recover and&nbsp;
gain his emotions back subscribe for more videos&nbsp;&nbsp;
