00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:09.500
Welcome to Slash Forward.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.530
Hey, what would you do if someone tried to
gather up your body for their personal collection?

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:18.460
On the one hand it’s nice to feel wanted,
but on the other hand it’s nice (totally

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.050
boss) to have personal autonomy.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.789
In consideration of this quandary, today we’ll
be looking at The Collection, the follow up

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.589
to The Collector, and taking a detailed view
of the storyline and possible strategies for

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:29.440
beating this sick freak.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.180
Along the way, be sure to drop a comment to
identify any openings you feel would be ideal

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.030
to facilitate parting ways with your new master.

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:36.079
Let’s get to it.

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:40.780
We open on a young lady named Elena, getting
a pep talk from Shooter McGavin, who makes

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.940
promises he is unable to keep.

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.210
Then, from expositional news stories, we learn
that ya boi’s been on a bit of a murder

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:50.520
spree about town.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.199
There is an active manhunt to find any potential
captive victims, with Arkin being the most

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.199
recent.

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:59.920
Concurrent to this timeline we meet back up
with a now-grown Elena, picking up a voice

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.199
call on her blackberry.

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.470
It’s her boo, Brian, cancelling their plans
for the evening due to an overwhelming work

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:07.470
schedule.

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.460
Which is fine, because Missy shows up unannounced,
dressed for an evening of debauchery.

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.200
On her way out, we see that Mr. Peters is
still there, hey good for him - and soon Elle

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.970
is hopping into the car, causing Josh to tent
his trousers.

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.140
They find an unusual man in an alley and,
upon stating the password, a world of dubstep

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.090
and house music opens itself to them.

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.539
The trio finds themselves immediately at home
amongst their fellow club rats, as they lose

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:35.350
themselves in a sea of gyrating flesh.

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.289
Their bliss is interrupted, however, when
Elle runs across bitchboy Brian, unrepentantly

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:42.229
making out with some rando.

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:47.149
She ends their relationship and storms off
as a familiar figure watches from the catwalk.

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:51.520
Elena eventually finds an empty room in which
she may cry out her troubles.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.530
Except it’s not empty, it contains a large,
red box.

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.039
Upon opening it, Arkin bursts out and drags
her down to avoid a spear, which we follow

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:05.649
backwards through a CGI joyride that eventually
winds up a steam-powered combine harvester

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:10.420
that threatens to harvest the clubsters, aaannnnd
then does just that.

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.830
Back at the start, Arkin’s aggressive requests
for help fail to endear him to Elena.

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.230
She then runs out in the confusion and finds
her fellow dancemates getting machete hacked

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:20.230
in the gunt.

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.790
Arkin uses a repurposed earring to employ
his lockpicking magic while Elle runs away

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.110
and turns a corner just in time to find Missy
caught up in a cattle call wherein she is

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.060
about to get slowly pressed by the collector,
which is kind of mean.

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.349
After their precious nutrients are extruded,
Elle makes it back to find Arkin busy escaping,

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:40.590
despite his prior relationship with windows.

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.609
He graces her with some feeble advice before
doing so himself.

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:50.530
But instead she gets boxed up as the collector
gazes wistfully at his lost prize - and then

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.060
they concurrently run and drive off.

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.950
We find Arkin in the ER, being examined and
patched up.

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.549
Although, the work is briefly interrupted
by the police who want to ensure he doesn’t

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:00.670
go running off somewhere.

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.200
They must not have told them about his injuries.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.879
When he wakes up, Lisa’s there.

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:08.790
She’s decided to stay, and murder has brought
them back together!

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.330
But they’re also accompanied by an anonymous
gift with a message threatening their safety,

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:14.849
so Arkin sends her off.

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:19.500
That evening he is visited by Lucello, a man
under the employ of Mr. Peters.

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.319
He’s seeking information about the collector
and has assembled a team with the intent to

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:26.510
track and kill the killer while retrieving
Elena.

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.420
Concerned for the general safety of his own
family, Arkin is more than willing to help

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:31.599
lead them there.

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:36.569
After calling to share the good news, we flashback
to learn that Lucello has also always been

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:37.569
there.

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:41.760
Then Elena wakes up in her box, which is likely
fairly ripe at this point, but it does have

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.139
a ventilation hole that’s good for peepin.

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:49.749
Through this, she sees a man receiving an
unspecified and unsolicited surgical intervention,

00:03:49.749 --> 00:03:52.189
with end results that are kind of bitchin.

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:56.120
Meanwhile, back at the briefing room, the
rules are set - Arkin will help them locate,

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.129
but will not go into the building.

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:02.019
Starting from the abduction point, they will
follow the pacing and directions indicated

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:05.190
by his lacerations until they reach the end
of the road.

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:09.919
This terminates at a spooky, abandoned hotel,
which is promising, and Arkin is convinced

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:11.239
to show them the way in.

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:15.989
As they approach the door and Arkin plies
his trade, Elle uses her brasserie to fishhook

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:17.419
the latch on her box.

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:22.460
Luckily, it was the only one that was closed
as upon yanking hard, the box then immediately

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:23.460
opens.

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.550
She finds herself in a laboratory of sorts,
and is prevented from leaving by the master’s

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:28.550
return.

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:32.350
When he sees the box open, he knows what’s
up and plays a little spidery game to flush

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:33.380
out his prey.

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:37.720
We learn that spiders sure do love crawling
on peoples’ faces - at the breaking point

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.520
Elle is saved when Arkin cracks the front
door, setting off an alarm.

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.290
As we catch up with the team we then discover
that Arkin is now getting the hard sell to

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:46.880
help them navigate the interior.

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.880
Do they know that he had been inside a box?

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.990
Elle still finds herself locked in the room.

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:55.310
However, by using a scalpel she’s able to
pop open a grate.

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:58.700
And, despite the uncomfortable quantity of
blood, she ventures in.

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:03.160
Elsewhere, the gang finds themselves in the
bug-zapper/needle room, so they’ve barely

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.170
made progress.

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:08.200
Lin gets himself chopped up at the front door
and, while distracted, they’re ambushed

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.540
by a strung out tweaker.

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:11.630
The collector keeps them around to do his
bidding.

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:14.730
But before they can make a plan for dealing
with this, they’re descended upon by the

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:18.970
rest of the group and just barely manage to
shoot their way to a safe little alcove where

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:23.170
they can lock down and assess the situation,
which is bad.

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:28.240
Elle emerges into a princess makeup room occupied
by a box lady who she lets out.

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.370
Abby seems normal-ish, but they have to work
through some trust issues.

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:36.650
Elena’s pretty keen on continuing toward
the exit so, despite Abby’s apprehensions,

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:39.100
she’s able to goad her out the door.

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:43.320
Meanwhile the team comes into a clearing where
another victim staggers out with a neck bound

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:48.281
payload that goes off, followed by several
murderous stalactites that run Dre through

00:05:48.281 --> 00:05:50.300
in a vertical orientation.

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:54.580
This gives Arkin the chance to skedaddle down
a nail adorned crevice and into an office

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:58.640
with poor lighting where he manages to narrowly
avoid recollection.

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:03.550
At the same time, Abby is showing Elle the
ropes, distinguishing undesirable rooms guarded

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:08.250
by tripwire and being generally supportive
and engaging - until Elle’s earpiece puts

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:11.480
off some nasty feedback, drawing attention
to her imperfection.

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:16.840
Abs becomes convinced this disadvantage will
guarantee their failure, uh, ableist much?

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:20.620
And her cries summon the collector who pursues
Elle down the dark hallways.

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:24.430
He eventually loses her amidst the ceiling
plumbing before becoming distracted by the

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:27.360
sound of Arkin crankin on some knobs nearby.

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:31.550
He demonstrates he’s learned nothing as
he how-dos a knife blade and then narrowly

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:32.720
avoids another trap.

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:37.120
Despite these travails, he eventually finds
himself in a much more calm and professional

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:38.120
environment.

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:41.940
As Elle continues on, she eventually comes
to a hallway in which she jiggles her earpiece

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:44.560
right onto one of a series of bear traps.

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:49.210
She manages to retrieve it and, despite the
hair trigger on this sucker, she proceeds.

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:52.920
When we catch back up with Arkin, he has now
proceeded further into what appears to be

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:58.390
a sort of viewing room that reveals the collector
not only acquires, but also creates works

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:00.850
of great beauty and sophistication.

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:03.320
Here he runs across a young lady pinned to
a wall.

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:07.360
But before he can take any action the collector
returns, looking to cross her off his to-do

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.890
list for the day before getting back to the
hunt.

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:14.130
Arkin then snags himself a pin so he can have
unlimited access to locked doors.

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:18.570
Elsewhere, Elle finds a Funhouse-style fan
hole through which she attempts to call out

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:21.440
to a couple of gentlemen keeping warm, but
to no avail.

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:26.070
As Arkin proceeds carefully, he is eventually
reunited with his old buddies who he had obviously

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:27.380
been looking for.

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:31.860
But there’s only one, true abductor in this
house, and he’s going fishing.

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:36.290
He’s also stepped up his kung fu training
since they last met as, with a simple flick

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:40.220
of the wrist, he manages to kill Wally and
send Paz screaming down a hallway past a door

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:41.550
that locks behind her.

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:45.800
Arkin tries to take this opportunity to convince
Lucello that it’s time to find a pathway

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:46.800
out.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:50.140
But he refuses to leave Elle behind, and then
Abby stumbles in providing hope that they

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:52.610
have a means by which they can locate Elle.

00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:56.850
Unfortunately, along the way, they’re distracted
by Paz’s screams and are compelled to move

00:07:56.850 --> 00:07:58.020
toward the sound.

00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:03.000
Lucello proceeds slowly down a haunted hallway
and, at the end, discovers he was tricked.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.570
Elena had similarly been pursuing the screams
and was actually the one on the right track.

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:11.920
Arkin then follows Abby’s gaze, only too
late, to the cord wired to a series of detonators

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:16.870
that go off in reverse order - allowing Lucello
to run down the hall just ahead of a sequence

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:20.540
of glitter bombs going off around him, like
an absolute badass.

00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:24.350
They’re then able to dip into an adjacent
room to meet up with Elle just as she’s

00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:26.020
removing Paz’s razor net.

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:30.000
Here they all take a minute to just vibe out,
until Abby’s presence ruins it.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.780
Elena then leads them to a possible way out,
and Arkin goes for the hail mary.

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:38.320
He puts a slug into the man, attracting quick
attention, which he then reinvigorates in

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:40.659
their general direction with the final bullet.

00:08:40.659 --> 00:08:45.340
Desiring to maintain the cozy homebase he
spent so long working on, the collector straps

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:46.740
up and readies himself.

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:50.510
With the end in sight, Abby now demonstrates
her true Stockholmian allegiance.

00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:54.879
Paz cold-cocks her, resulting in an outcome
that far exceeds expectations.

00:08:54.879 --> 00:08:59.139
Then the collector busts in and starts spraying
indiscriminately until he’s empty.

00:08:59.139 --> 00:09:03.720
In the aftermath, angered by the fate of his
most precious, he claims a consolation prize

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:04.779
and darts off.

00:09:04.779 --> 00:09:08.889
Lucello finds himself on the brink of being
snapped up, and right when time is of the

00:09:08.889 --> 00:09:09.889
essence.

00:09:09.889 --> 00:09:11.879
So he sends them off and fends for himself.

00:09:11.879 --> 00:09:16.060
As the SWAT team rolls in, the survivors try
to prevent one last art installment, but soon

00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:20.560
find themselves ensnared and staring into
the eyes of a stone-cold killer (bitch).

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:24.350
Arkin reverts back to his old tricks and tries
to rile him up so he makes a mistake, but

00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:28.699
the collector is in total control here and
he casually prepares to eliminate the evidence

00:09:28.699 --> 00:09:30.170
of his misdeeds.

00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:33.420
Laying down some flammable liquids and stoking
up a fire.

00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:36.670
In the cage, they try to reach the latch,
but can’t quite get to it.

00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:41.430
So, Arkin sets himself up and kindly requests
Elle provide him a second elbow.

00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:46.060
He then uses this like a drillbit extender,
achieving an unnatural angle that allows him

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:47.060
to flip the latch.

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:50.529
Paz quickly resets his arm, a huge help, and
then they run.

00:09:50.529 --> 00:09:54.990
They arrive at the specimen room where the
collector unceremoniously stabs Paz, and then

00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:57.089
Arkin gets his shit rocked.

00:09:57.089 --> 00:10:01.269
At just that moment, Lucello shows up and
some classic knife play ensues.

00:10:01.269 --> 00:10:06.110
They do what they must, but you can really
tell they’ve formed a mutual respect.

00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:07.579
Even so, Lucello gets it.

00:10:07.579 --> 00:10:09.499
Arkin sees an opening and tops him.

00:10:09.499 --> 00:10:12.899
But he fails to control the knife hand, and
takes a blade through both cheeks.

00:10:12.899 --> 00:10:17.019
Elle sees that they’re very close to a way
out and alerts emergency personnel to their

00:10:17.019 --> 00:10:21.999
presence while Arkin goes beast mode, taking
in some intense, sustained eye contact before

00:10:21.999 --> 00:10:26.290
dumping his foe into the bin and sending him
a little flame that results in the collector’s

00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:29.800
death and the deaths of all the innocent victims
down there with him.

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:33.540
As the firemen work to disassemble the doorway,
Arkin’s escape is blocked.

00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:37.759
At the end of his rope, he goes ahead and
gives in as the flames comfortingly lick at

00:10:37.759 --> 00:10:40.019
him like little incendiary tongues.

00:10:40.019 --> 00:10:44.389
But then Elle steps up to achieve her redemption
and starts busting open the large jars surrounding

00:10:44.389 --> 00:10:47.569
them that are, thankfully, not full of formaldehyde.

00:10:47.569 --> 00:10:51.730
Once they make it outside, they get all patched
up and reunited, and Arkin goes to do his

00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:53.290
own accounting of the bodies.

00:10:53.290 --> 00:10:57.089
He finds a box with a smoking mask, but no
evidence of its owner.

00:10:57.089 --> 00:11:00.269
We then flash forward sometime later to a
well-kept home.

00:11:00.269 --> 00:11:05.079
A man arrives and turns on the news, but a
sudden station change alerts him to a presence.

00:11:05.079 --> 00:11:07.790
He proceeds cautiously until Arkin reveals
himself.

00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:13.319
He’s been stalking the 14 licensed entomologists
who live within a 200 mile radius when he

00:11:13.319 --> 00:11:18.589
came upon him - a museum owner’s son driven
insane at a young age by the bug madness.

00:11:18.589 --> 00:11:23.370
Vowing to make sure he feels what his victims
felt, Arkin then entraps him forcefully in

00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:24.370
a box.

00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:26.160
That was a solid follow up.

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:30.059
Unfortunately, despite going into pre-production,
the third installment has been officially

00:11:30.059 --> 00:11:32.800
killed, meaning we won’t get to see Arkin
take his revenge.

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:36.130
Although, that also means that the lessons
learned here should be sufficient to ensure

00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:38.939
your full survival in the event of a collector-like
abduction.

00:11:38.939 --> 00:11:43.540
So, let’s work through the scenarios presented
to see how we could maximize survivability.

00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:47.370
Starting with the club scene, there are a
few general rules and expectations here that

00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:49.509
will be of service to us throughout life.

00:11:49.509 --> 00:11:51.709
It’s not clear how this set up came to be.

00:11:51.709 --> 00:11:56.319
Did the collector retrofit this rave site
in preparation for the weekend’s festivities,

00:11:56.319 --> 00:12:01.470
or is it a purpose-built location he set up
and then promoted so as to draw in his victim

00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:02.470
pool?

00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:04.519
Did he hire this guy to work the door, for
instance?

00:12:04.519 --> 00:12:06.480
Both possibilities are hard to fathom.

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:10.770
But either way, this is not a scenario you
go into with the expectation of danger, which

00:12:10.770 --> 00:12:15.389
is why it’s so important to abide by a praxis
of generally applicable rules.

00:12:15.389 --> 00:12:19.619
To start, you have to train your mind and
body to get high on life.

00:12:19.619 --> 00:12:24.829
Feel the music and become energized by the
pulsing, sweaty mass of humanity around you.

00:12:24.829 --> 00:12:28.569
Because if you come here looking to get trashed
on some low-grade club drugs, you’re pretty

00:12:28.569 --> 00:12:30.160
much done before you start.

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:34.119
It’s hard to pick out specific details in
these kinds of settings, so any inhibition

00:12:34.119 --> 00:12:37.959
to this will essentially ensure you come out
of the scenario dead.

00:12:37.959 --> 00:12:41.180
Using this as a foundation, there are two
simple rules to employ.

00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:44.059
The first is to always be taking in your surroundings.

00:12:44.059 --> 00:12:48.350
As you walk through unfamiliar territory you
should never be looking in a single direction

00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:52.740
for more than a few seconds before glancing
around in several other directions to ensure

00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:54.790
you know what’s going on around you.

00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:58.459
As you’re talking to a lady, glance over
each of her shoulders so you’re aware of

00:12:58.459 --> 00:12:59.459
what’s downfield.

00:12:59.459 --> 00:13:04.350
Whilst engaged in grinding on a man’s crotch,
make sure you look up and around to keep tabs

00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:05.649
on any exit points.

00:13:05.649 --> 00:13:10.459
The other rule is integral to avoid unwelcome
surprises, and it is that you should always

00:13:10.459 --> 00:13:12.089
expect a ceiling thresher.

00:13:12.089 --> 00:13:16.089
It’s the only way to fully protect yourself
from ceiling threshers.

00:13:16.089 --> 00:13:19.600
When it inevitably happens, you will have
to make sure you consider what’s best for

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:22.089
you while assessing the crowd’s inclinations.

00:13:22.089 --> 00:13:26.100
For instance, this crowd had a tendency to
run to the back of the room, when it is clear

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:28.839
that laying low optimized success.

00:13:28.839 --> 00:13:31.819
Not saying you can’t bring a couple of your
neighbors down with you, I’m just saying

00:13:31.819 --> 00:13:33.949
to not be afraid to go your own way.

00:13:33.949 --> 00:13:37.889
From there, if you’re in a relatively safe
spot, what do we do?

00:13:37.889 --> 00:13:39.430
Avoid unnecessary action.

00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:42.980
If there appears to be a way out, but it’s
been established that the main hazard are

00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:47.360
surprise traps, treat your advance like a
cliff-diving excursion: always let someone

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:49.519
else go first to test the depth.

00:13:49.519 --> 00:13:53.449
Once in the hall, take another moment to assess
your surroundings and don’t be greedy about

00:13:53.449 --> 00:13:54.449
running.

00:13:54.449 --> 00:13:56.660
The traps have been sprung, you’re momentarily
safe.

00:13:56.660 --> 00:14:00.290
Excessive action has been punished so don’t
feel compelled to keep moving.

00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:04.180
The window did represent an excellent point
of escape, although Arkin went about it in

00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:05.180
the wrong way.

00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:09.819
Sure, you will want to break the glass before
going through in order to avoid any life-threatening

00:14:09.819 --> 00:14:10.819
lacerations.

00:14:10.819 --> 00:14:15.279
However, if you find yourself using a cadaver
to do so, I’m not sure you’re best served

00:14:15.279 --> 00:14:18.199
by riding that poor bastard all the way to
the bottom.

00:14:18.199 --> 00:14:22.720
Sure, people are basically water-filled meat
sacks, but they're not the equivalent of a

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:23.720
waterbed.

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:26.950
They’re more like a waterbed that contains
a random assortment of antlers.

00:14:26.950 --> 00:14:29.660
If you land wrong, you risk significant injury.

00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:31.970
Do the window, then tuck and roll if possible.

00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:32.970
If not, try to remain flat and land on your
side, the ideal position for surviving a terrible

00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:33.970
fall.

00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:35.490
The next scenario is the lab when Elena escapes
her box.

00:14:35.490 --> 00:14:39.769
There was limited time to explore here before
her captor returned, but there were a lot

00:14:39.769 --> 00:14:44.529
of tools available that could do quick damage
- as demonstrated by her acquiring the scalpel

00:14:44.529 --> 00:14:46.180
after he left her again.

00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:50.059
Now, the collector is a formidable foe, and
it’s unlikely that she would have been able

00:14:50.059 --> 00:14:51.839
to handle him one on one.

00:14:51.839 --> 00:14:54.980
However, she had the element of surprise working
in her favor.

00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:59.399
The key is to accept the fact that this scenario
clearly indicates your captor intends to kill

00:14:59.399 --> 00:15:03.950
you rather than hold you for ransom, and so
you will have to respond with intent to kill.

00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:06.920
She ended up not having to do this, but only
by sheer luck.

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:10.420
This represents a failure of character on
her part, I’m sorry to say.

00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:14.350
The next sequence of calamities that befall
the extraction team really just comes down

00:15:14.350 --> 00:15:19.990
to following common rules, as stated in previous
videos and accentuated in this one as well.

00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:23.179
They tunnel hard, taking ceiling spikes through
the torso.

00:15:23.179 --> 00:15:25.740
You have to take note of your surroundings.

00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:29.560
From there Arkin puts himself into a scenario
where, if something were to happen, he would

00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:30.600
have no escape.

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:36.110
He lucks through this and transitions to absent-mindedly
taking unnecessary damage by shaking hands

00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:39.790
with a knife blade before nearly ending his
journey after tripping a trap.

00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:44.939
He of anyone should know that use of the hands
is of vital importance, you can’t give that

00:15:44.939 --> 00:15:45.939
up so easily.

00:15:45.939 --> 00:15:49.690
Which is too bad, because these little, individual
traps are basically throwaways.

00:15:49.690 --> 00:15:54.380
They’re very easy to see, and likely are
intended to repel people from areas the collector

00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:58.959
intends them not to go, which seems to imply
that is exactly where they want to be.

00:15:58.959 --> 00:16:01.670
For instance, the narrow hallway with the
bear traps.

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:05.209
Surely that’s not just the normal state
of affairs that the collector navigates through

00:16:05.209 --> 00:16:08.160
on a regular basis, especially considering
their sensitivity.

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:12.850
It is unusual that the earpiece falling on
them does not instigate the trap, but removing

00:16:12.850 --> 00:16:13.850
it does.

00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:17.440
Regardless, this represents a choice about
whether to risk injury or alert.

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:21.990
She could basically spit on them to make them
go off, allowing her to proceed more safely.

00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:25.699
However, in so doing, she may alert her enemies
to her presence.

00:16:25.699 --> 00:16:30.059
This is a 50/50 scenario, and there’s not
really a wrong way to go about it as long

00:16:30.059 --> 00:16:33.300
as you manage to get to whatever it is you’re
being kept from.

00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:37.519
Next we circle back with Arkin, who is capable
of using any random straight object he can

00:16:37.519 --> 00:16:39.910
find to pick any lock that exists.

00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:44.269
This speaks to the importance of being a student
of life with a thirst for knowledge who always

00:16:44.269 --> 00:16:45.989
seeks to expand on your skillset.

00:16:45.989 --> 00:16:51.589
Which is a perfect segue toward bringing up
today’s sponsor, skillshare... but not really.

00:16:51.589 --> 00:16:56.029
The next point where we find some clear opportunities
is when Lucello goes to investigate the screams.

00:16:56.029 --> 00:17:00.449
Abby has been acting unusual for a while,
and warranted a closer eye.

00:17:00.449 --> 00:17:04.309
Now Arkin follows her gaze to the cord, which
causes him to let out a warning yelp, but

00:17:04.309 --> 00:17:05.920
he doesn’t do more than that.

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:08.340
This is a scenario that favors definitive
action.

00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:11.949
He should have let out a warning immediately,
but also could have made some attempt to pull

00:17:11.949 --> 00:17:16.420
or disconnect the wire in the hope that it
would have some material benefit for Lucello.

00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:19.530
After this, there is clearly no reason to
trust Abby any further.

00:17:19.530 --> 00:17:23.559
Her fear that the collector is going to win
and then punish her severely has tainted her

00:17:23.559 --> 00:17:25.209
entire thought process.

00:17:25.209 --> 00:17:29.019
In the case of the bombs, she proactively
looked in their direction with some familiarity.

00:17:29.019 --> 00:17:31.419
It’s clear that she is not fully on their
side.

00:17:31.419 --> 00:17:35.279
However, I’m not sure doing anything up
front would have made a huge difference.

00:17:35.279 --> 00:17:38.850
She locked them into a room, but it was the
room Elena led them to.

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:41.940
While there, she did them the service of taking
out an errant trap.

00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:45.270
If they had left, they would have ran straight
into the collector, who was coming down the

00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:47.419
hall with a gun and some dogs anyway.

00:17:47.419 --> 00:17:52.169
So, closer supervision due to her body language
and generally high level of agitation would

00:17:52.169 --> 00:17:56.279
be recommended, but had no real impact on
the outcome in this particular circumstance.

00:17:56.279 --> 00:18:00.250
Things get a little muddy from here - I thought
the nails were just to hurt you a little and

00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:04.200
punish a misstep, but Lucello is afraid to
move, acting like the nails are meant to trip

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:05.520
the trap hanging above him.

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:09.630
It’s also not clear how he was able to avoid
a fatal outcome by, apparently, holding up

00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:10.670
a dog carcass?

00:18:10.670 --> 00:18:12.250
I don’t know what’s going on here.

00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:13.500
From there we return full circle.

00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:16.890
I know it’s hard when the finish line is
in sight, but in matters of life or death,

00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:18.940
you must always be operating at 100%.

00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:23.500
If the gang had seen Elena, cried out in joy,
but then also assumed a ceiling thresher,

00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:28.130
they would have seen the gigantic cage dangling
above them and been able to avoid this trap

00:18:28.130 --> 00:18:29.130
completely.

00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:32.650
It really only represents a minor annoyance
both from outside and from inside.

00:18:32.650 --> 00:18:36.580
If you watch how easily the latch slides,
you’ll quickly realize they likely could

00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:38.280
have shaken it loose from the inside.

00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:41.730
Or, if they had someone on the outside, just
easily pull it open.

00:18:41.730 --> 00:18:44.899
At this point, both you and the collector
have reached the end of the road, and there

00:18:44.899 --> 00:18:48.809
is nothing more that can be done to pull you
through other than to rely on your grit and

00:18:48.809 --> 00:18:49.890
force of will.

00:18:49.890 --> 00:18:52.279
But it’s been a journey, so have some fun
with it.

00:18:52.279 --> 00:18:57.149
As a man who clearly appreciates creativity,
I’m sure if you utilized the resources around

00:18:57.149 --> 00:19:01.350
you to come up with a novel means of administering
pain and punishment, he would become distracted

00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:05.380
or even possibly giddy about the opportunity
to take part in your new venture.

00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:11.200
Before we go, I’d like to give a huge thanks
to my donors, memorialized in the hall of

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:13.880
headshots.

00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:25.210
I have a website set up where you can support
the channel through donations or merch.

00:19:25.210 --> 00:19:29.730
Any donation unlocks uncensored movie reviews
of Lifeforce and Under the Skin, with others

00:19:29.730 --> 00:19:31.370
to be added over time.

00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:34.640
If you enjoyed the video, I’d love for you
to become a part of the channel by subscribing.

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:35.809
Thanks for watching.
