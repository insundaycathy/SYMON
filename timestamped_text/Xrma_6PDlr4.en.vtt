00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.629
Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.629 --> 00:00:06.580
Today, I’m going to explain a comedy and
horror film called, “Jennifer’s Body.”

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:08.029
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:09.940
Watch out and take care.

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:15.230
Anita Lesnicki, known to people as “Needy”
is an alleged violent murderer currently locked

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:17.390
up in a correctional facility.

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.080
Needy is known for her alleged crimes and
receives hundreds of letters every day from

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.560
people cursing her to hell or begging her
to accept Jesus Christ into her heart.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.390
Innocent or not, the scars on her body tell
a different story.

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:34.409
After kicking a doctor on the chest at the
cafeteria, Needy is sent to solitary confinement.

00:00:34.409 --> 00:00:36.359
She wasn’t always like this.

00:00:36.359 --> 00:00:39.809
Believe it or not, there was a time when she
was considered normal.

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.389
Enclosed in darkness, Needy thinks about the
past several months.

00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:45.579
She came from Devil’s Kettle, Minnesota.

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:48.320
The town is named after a local waterfall.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.019
The thing is nobody knows where the water
goes.

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:55.289
One time, a group of scientists dropped a
bucket of red balls into the whirlpool, but

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.819
nothing ever resurfaced.

00:00:56.819 --> 00:01:01.209
Here, in this little town where almost nothing
interesting ever happens is where it all went

00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:02.579
down.

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.590
Needy is living a relatively normal teenage
life.

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:10.490
Even though she’s considered as the local
dork, she has a boyfriend named Chip and is

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.940
best friends with the hottest girl in school,
Jennifer Check.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.240
Jen and Needy were playmates when they were
young and they’ve been inseparable ever

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.240
since.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.600
After a school event, Jen invites Needy to
watch an indie rock band called Low Shoulder

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.950
who’s performing at the local dive bar,
Melody Lane.

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.740
Later that night, Needy hangs out with Chip
in her bedroom as she chooses an outfit for

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:31.950
the rock show.

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.719
Chip feels weirded out by their friendship
and accuses her of doing anything that Jen

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:37.270
tells her to do.

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.690
She defends this but deep down inside her,
she knows this isn’t entirely true.

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.539
She tries to change the topic and makes out
with her boyfriend on the bed, but they’re

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:47.450
interrupted as Jen arrives.

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.159
Jen teases Chip for being jealous because
he wasn’t invited as she and Needy get into

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:52.569
her car.

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:56.429
They arrive at Melody Lane, which is more
of a bar instead of a club.

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:00.369
The bar is full for the night and they see
some of their schoolmates, the foreign exchange

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:06.340
student, Ahmet, and Craig from the football
team whom Jen turns down.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:12.280
At the counter, they’re approached by officer-in-training,
Roman, a guy with who Jen has been having

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.569
an on-and-off affair, but she turns him down
too.

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.209
Jen turns Needy’s attention to the band
as they’re setting up on the stage.

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:25.500
She drags her nerdy best friend and introduces
themselves to the lead singer, Nikolai Wolf.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.310
Jen flirts with Nikolai and offers to buy
him a drink which he happily accepts.

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.830
As Jen goes to get some drinks, Needy stays
behind and overhears the conversation between

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.239
Nikolai and their bassist, Dirk.

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:40.040
Nikolai thinks that Jen is the one, telling
his friend that she’s definitely a virgin,

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.349
a girl who likes to put it out but never puts
it in.

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:46.730
Needy confronts Nikolai and tells him that
he’s a sleazy creep.

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.640
She goes to Jen and tells her that Nikolai
only wants her because he thinks she’s a

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:51.640
virgin.

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.920
Jen thinks this is crazy because she isn’t
even a backdoor virgin any more thanks to

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.010
Roman.

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.700
Just then, the band starts playing and they
watch and listen as they open with their first

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:00.760
song.

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.940
Jen is hopeless and feels giddy about the
lead singer, despite the remarks, and holds

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.220
Needy’s hand.

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.430
Needy feels happy seeing her friend happy,
but she lets go of her hand, feeling insecure

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.390
and thinking that she’ll never match up
to her pretty and popular best friend.

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.280
At the corner of her eye, Needy spots a fire
starting near the stage.

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.189
The curtains instantly catch fire and spread
across the ceiling, bringing down some of

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:23.620
the decorations.

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.250
The band stops playing as the whole bar quickly
goes up in flames.

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.460
A stampede occurs as Needy and Jen stand in
the room, hearing the cracking of bones.

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:37.090
A pile of wood falls down, crushing some of
their schoolmates as they both watch in horror.

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.920
Needy snaps out and drags Jen into the bathroom.

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.050
They escape through one of the windows and
reach the parking lot.

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.620
She comforts Jen who looks shocked and dazed.

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.180
Nikolai turns up from nowhere and hands Jen
a suspicious drink.

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.579
He insists that the girls go into his van,
but Needy refuses.

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:56.910
Jen, on the other hand, takes the drink and
goes with Nikolai.

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:00.260
Needy calls after her best friend but Jen
refuses to listen.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.950
As she watches Jen go inside the van, Needy
knows something bad is about to happen.

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.569
Meanwhile, Melody Lane is burned to the ground.

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:10.840
Needy makes it home and calls Chip and tells
him about what happened.

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.400
Suddenly, her doorbell rings.

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.620
She keeps Chip on the phone as she goes down
to investigate, but when she opens the door,

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:18.890
nobody’s there.

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:22.300
Needy hangs up the phone and then spots a
shadow in the hallway.

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.240
She slowly walks to the door and opens it,
but the closet is empty too.

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.480
She goes into the kitchen to close the leaking
faucet and turns to face Jen, all bloody and

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.090
beaten in her outfit.

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:35.730
She tries to get some sense of what happened
to her, but her best friend can only reply

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:37.700
in animalistic grunts.

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:41.450
Jen goes to the fridge and starts eating their
food like a wild animal.

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:45.770
Needy tries to stop her but she suddenly starts
retching and vomits a pool of black, spiky

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:47.610
liquid on the linoleum.

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.700
She checks Jen’s wrist and feels almost
no pulse.

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:55.450
Needy runs to the hallway to call for help,
but Jen stops her and pins her to the wall.

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:59.650
She asks her if she’s scared to which Needy
nods and leans to breathe on her neck.

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:02.760
She drops her to the floor and escapes through
the main door.

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.330
Needy is left mortified at what happened.

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:09.350
The next morning at school, Needy is shocked
to see Jen alive and well.

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:13.260
Jen still looked the same, but she acted as
if nothing happened last night and is being

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:14.380
indifferent.

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:17.940
Needy knows that what happened yesterday was
real because she spent the whole night scrubbing

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:19.740
the vomit off the floor.

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:23.910
Jen dismisses her concerns and insists that
she’s just being overdramatic.

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:29.020
Just then, their teacher with the prosthetic
hand, Mr. Wroblewski, comes in to announce

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:30.550
the grim news.

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:34.300
After class, Needy meets Chip in the hallway
and tells him about what happened with Jen

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:35.510
last night.

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:41.040
Colin Gray, the high school’s local goth,
approaches her to check in on her after yesterday’s

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.040
fire.

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:46.520
Chip teases his girlfriend, but Needy reassures
him that he’s got nothing to worry about.

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:51.901
Meanwhile, Jen approaches Jonas Kozelle, one
of Craig’s best friends, who’s mourning

00:05:51.901 --> 00:05:54.150
in the middle of their football field.

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:57.490
Jen convinces him to go with her to the woods
because Craig would have wanted the two of

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:58.800
them together.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.080
As they make out in the woods, animals start
to surround them.

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:06.170
Jonas feels weirded out but Jen distracts
him by taking her shirt off.

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:09.420
She rips his jersey off and starts unzipping
his pants.

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:13.300
She then whispers to him that she’s going
to see his best friend real soon.

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:17.270
She pushes him against a tree and the last
thing Jonas sees is Jen’s eyes turning black

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:21.700
and her open mouth revealing her razor-sharp
teeth, ready to cut into his flesh.

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:27.240
Jonas’s screams reach the school’s parking
lot and alert their teacher, Mr. Wroblewski.

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:32.250
Feeling suspicious, he goes into the woods
and finds Jonas’s disemboweled dead body.

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:36.580
Back at home, Needy prepares a sandwich for
her mom as she listens to the radio.

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:41.630
Since the fire, Nikolai’s band, Low Shoulder,
has been getting tons of positive publicity.

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:45.400
As they talk over their meal, Jonas is taken
out of the woods through a body bag by the

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:50.550
police, while the killer, Jen, takes a bath
at a nearby lake, washing away all the evidence

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:52.160
of her bloody feast.

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:56.560
Later that night, Jen is on the phone with
Needy telling her about her perfect day.

00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:02.430
After killing Jonas, she finds herself transformed,
feeling no pain, even burning her own tongue.

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:05.490
Needy gets another call and it’s her boyfriend,
Chip.

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:08.860
Needy hangs up on Jen and meets with Chip
at McCullum Park.

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:12.570
He tells her that the police are over at Kozelle’s
house and that Jonas was found dead in the

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:13.710
woods.

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:17.610
Needy says that with the fire and the killing,
it can’t be a coincidence.

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:20.360
Chip is horrified but reassures her that things
will get better.

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:24.750
A month after the fire and the killing of
Jonas Kozelle, the town found its way to slowly

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:25.750
heal.

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:29.160
The national news picked up the tragedies
of Devil Kettle and milked it as much as they

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:30.160
could.

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:34.340
Low Shoulder has gotten even bigger, capitalizing
on their part of the fire, and has made their

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:37.930
song the unofficial theme song of unity and
healing for the town.

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:42.070
Soon enough, Mr. Wrolewski announces that
Low Shoulder is holding a charity benefit

00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:44.020
for the victims of the fire.

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:47.840
Needy calls them out for being crass but is
attacked by her classmates.

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:52.320
After class is dismissed, Needy walks with
Jen, pointing out that she looks pale and

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:53.320
haggard.

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:55.410
Jen says that it’s probably wearing off.

00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:59.850
Before Needy could ask further, their conversation
is interrupted by Colin, who asks Jen out

00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:01.120
on a date.

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:04.800
Jen turns him down initially but Needy insists
that he’s a cool guy.

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:07.180
Suddenly, Jen gets an idea.

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:10.490
She calls him back and tells him to meet at
her house and watch a movie.

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:14.920
Chip joins them in the hallway and feels weird
that Colin is talking to his girlfriend again,

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:18.320
but Needy tells him that he was only asking
Jen out on a date.

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:21.500
Later that night, Needy hangs out with Chip
in his bedroom.

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:24.140
They start making out and undressing each
other.

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:27.850
On the other side of town, Colin drives up
to an empty neighborhood.

00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:31.460
He stops at the address that Jen gave him
and enters the unfinished house through the

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:32.460
back.

00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:36.389
He explores around the house, looking for
Jen, and finally finds her in a room filled

00:08:36.389 --> 00:08:37.740
with candles.

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:40.380
She takes off her jacket and they start making
out.

00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:44.350
The sight of rats stops Colin but she lures
him back and takes off his pants.

00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:48.470
Suddenly, Jen’s eyes turn dark as approaches
a terrified Colin.

00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:52.770
She breaks his bones and pins him down on
the floor and starts to devour his soul.

00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:56.920
Meanwhile, Chip and Needy are making love
when she spots the leaking blood on the ceiling

00:08:56.920 --> 00:09:00.430
and sees Jonas dead in the room together with
a demonic Jen.

00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:04.600
She gasps in horror until Chip stops, concerned
for his girlfriend.

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:08.600
Back at the house, Colin is dead with his
intestines out as Jen eats the rest of his

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:09.800
insides.

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:13.089
Needy runs out of Chip’s house and drives
her way home crying.

00:09:13.089 --> 00:09:17.410
She almost runs over Jen on the highway but
she swerves to the right just in time.

00:09:17.410 --> 00:09:21.970
When she stops, she looks around for Jen,
but she’s nowhere to be found.

00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:26.029
Something jumps on her windshield, cracking
the glass, and it’s her best friend.

00:09:26.029 --> 00:09:30.510
Needy screams as Jen gets off her car and
she drives the other way home.

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:33.490
Needy reaches her house and screams for her
mom.

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:36.430
Finding herself alone, she sobs in the living
room.

00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:40.199
She thinks about Jen and blames herself for
letting her into the van.

00:09:40.199 --> 00:09:44.300
She gets up and goes into her bedroom and
screams when she finds Jen laying next to

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:45.300
her.

00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:47.399
Jen calms her down and begins kissing her.

00:09:47.399 --> 00:09:52.000
Feeling confused, Needy kisses her back, and
the two make out briefly on her bed.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.339
Needy stops and freaks out, feeling more complicated
than ever.

00:09:55.339 --> 00:09:59.980
She threatens to call the police but Jen reminds
her that she has the cops in her back pocket.

00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:03.649
Jen then tells her about what really happened
to her that night of the fire.

00:10:03.649 --> 00:10:06.889
After she got into the truck, the guys drove
her to the falls.

00:10:06.889 --> 00:10:10.820
She saw all the occult and supernatural books
in their van and thinking that they’re sexual

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:14.839
offenders, she insists that she’s a virgin,
so they should let her go and get someone

00:10:14.839 --> 00:10:16.750
else who’s more experienced.

00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:20.009
Unbeknownst to her, this is what they guys
exactly need.

00:10:20.009 --> 00:10:23.810
When they reached the falls, Jen tried to
escape but it’s really dark so Nikolai caught

00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:25.240
her immediately.

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:28.790
The guys carried her near the falls and tied
her up as they prepared for the ritual.

00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:32.230
Dirk handed Nikolai a piece of paper and a
knife.

00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:34.079
They then started the ritual.

00:10:34.079 --> 00:10:37.980
It turned out, they’re sacrificing a virgin
to the Devil so that the Devil in turn can

00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:40.629
grant them fame and success as a band.

00:10:40.629 --> 00:10:43.430
Jen begs for her life, but the guys’ minds
are set.

00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:47.370
Nikolai held up the knife and stabbed her
multiple times before tossing the knife into

00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:49.050
the waterfall hole.

00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:52.360
Back at Needy’s room, Jen finishes telling
the story.

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:55.899
She tells Needy that the stabs should have
killed her, but they didn’t.

00:10:55.899 --> 00:10:59.860
Jen made her way back to Needy, feeling hungry
for blood, but she didn’t have it in her

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:01.339
to kill her friend.

00:11:01.339 --> 00:11:05.399
On her way home, Jen approaches Ahmet who’s
just leaving the scene of the fire, and makes

00:11:05.399 --> 00:11:07.170
him her first victim.

00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:11.100
Jen tells a shocked Needy that when she’s
eaten and full, she’s unkillable.

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:15.160
She can now withstand virtually any injury
without pain and heal instantly.

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:19.300
Needy brings up their encounter in her car,
but Jen quickly dismisses it.

00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:22.980
She then demands Jen to leave and she does
so by jumping through Needy’s second-floor

00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:24.250
bedroom window.

00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:26.920
Needy attends Colin’s burial the next morning.

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:29.550
She has to stop Jen in any way she can.

00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:33.160
She starts researching about demons and the
occult, and a way to stop her friend from

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:34.790
killing any more boys.

00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:38.129
Chip meets up with her at school and brings
up the school dance.

00:11:38.129 --> 00:11:41.639
She tells him that they shouldn’t go to
the dance at all, but he’s really more concerned

00:11:41.639 --> 00:11:42.999
about behavior.

00:11:42.999 --> 00:11:47.120
They go to a quieter place and Needy finally
tells Chip the truth about Jen.

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:50.980
It turns out that Nikolai made a mistake when
they sacrificed Jen because she wasn’t a

00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:54.050
complete virgin anymore since junior high.

00:11:54.050 --> 00:11:58.120
According to Needy’s research, if the human
sacrifice is impure, the result may still

00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:02.050
be attained, but the demon will remain in
the host’s body who will continue to feed

00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:03.579
its thirst for blood.

00:12:03.579 --> 00:12:07.230
Chip refuses to believe her which prompts
Needy to break up with him.

00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:11.360
As the whole school prepares for the dance,
Needy worries about Jen’s next victim.

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:15.899
At Chip’s house, his mother gives him a
can of pepper spray which he takes hesitantly.

00:12:15.899 --> 00:12:21.079
Meanwhile, Jen is wearing down, her hair is
falling out, and her skin is breaking out.

00:12:21.079 --> 00:12:23.500
She needs to take her next victim soon.

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:26.499
Needy arrives at the dance and keeps an eye
out for Jen.

00:12:26.499 --> 00:12:31.050
Meanwhile, Chip is walking through the park
to get to school when he’s stopped by Jen.

00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:34.769
She lures him to the trees, saying that she
wants to talk about Needy.

00:12:34.769 --> 00:12:38.639
She then lies to Chip, telling him that the
reason Needy was so broken up over Colin’s

00:12:38.639 --> 00:12:42.069
death was because they were hooking up on
a semi-regular basis.

00:12:42.069 --> 00:12:45.670
Jen starts flirting with Chip, lying to him
that she’s liked him all along, and then

00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:47.199
starts kissing him.

00:12:47.199 --> 00:12:51.470
They start making out under the trees until
Chip suggests they go somewhere else.

00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:56.059
Back at school, Needy watches in anger as
she watches Low Shoulder open with their song.

00:12:56.059 --> 00:12:59.589
Suddenly, she realizes why Jen hasn’t appeared
all night.

00:12:59.589 --> 00:13:01.370
She’s after Chip.

00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:05.120
Needy runs over to Chip’s house and learns
that he left 20 minutes ago.

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:08.470
She then runs to the park, knowing he would
have gone through there.

00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:12.040
Meanwhile, Jen takes Chip to an abandoned
community pool.

00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:15.120
They sit at the edge of the pool and start
kissing again.

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:18.200
But Chip pulls back, saying that it feels
weird.

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:22.070
This angers Jen and she pushes him to the
water and starts dragging and hitting up against

00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:23.649
the tiled walls.

00:13:23.649 --> 00:13:27.629
Needy arrives just in time and finds Jen eating
her boyfriend’s neck.

00:13:27.629 --> 00:13:30.990
She jumps into the pool and tries to drown
her former friend.

00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:35.860
She goes back to Chip, who’s still alive
but bleeding, and tosses her the pepper spray.

00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:39.209
Jen resurfaces from the water and she sprays
the bottle at her.

00:13:39.209 --> 00:13:42.290
She screams and vomits black puke all over
them.

00:13:42.290 --> 00:13:45.369
Jen starts levitating and steps outside the
pool.

00:13:45.369 --> 00:13:47.509
Needy and Chip get out of the pool.

00:13:47.509 --> 00:13:51.480
Needy finally confronts Jen, telling her that
she was never a good friend.

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:53.249
Jen always wants what she wants.

00:13:53.249 --> 00:13:57.959
Needy accuses her of being insecure and tells
her that she’s no longer socially relevant.

00:13:57.959 --> 00:14:02.059
Jen screams at her and threatens to eat her
soul, but when she lunges towards her, Chip

00:14:02.059 --> 00:14:05.569
brings up the broken pool cleaner and stabs
her in the torso.

00:14:05.569 --> 00:14:10.550
She pulls out the pole, in pain but still
alive, and walks away from her former friend.

00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:12.180
Needy then comforts Chip.

00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:16.470
They apologize to each other and declare their
love for each other, but it’s too late.

00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:20.029
Chip has been bleeding too fast and has lost
a lot of blood.

00:14:20.029 --> 00:14:23.369
He slowly fades away and dies as Needy sobs
by his side.

00:14:23.369 --> 00:14:26.279
Needy goes back home in her torn and ruined
dress.

00:14:26.279 --> 00:14:29.680
She has nothing to live for now, but she can
still do something right.

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:32.240
She’s going to stop Jen no matter what.

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:35.540
She cleans herself up and marches her way
to Jen’s house.

00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:39.129
From Jen’s bedroom window, Needy could see
her worn and weak.

00:14:39.129 --> 00:14:43.019
She breaks into her window and lunges at her
but Jen avoids her attack.

00:14:43.019 --> 00:14:46.670
Needy pins her down on the bed and tries to
strangle her to death but she bites her on

00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:47.819
the neck.

00:14:47.819 --> 00:14:51.020
Needy takes out a box cutter and crosses out
her stomach.

00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:54.259
Jen starts levitating from the bed and they
struggle midair.

00:14:54.259 --> 00:14:58.009
Needy grabs their friendship necklace and
this stuns Jen, prompting her to fall back

00:14:58.009 --> 00:14:59.240
to the bed.

00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:02.750
As much as she hated Needy, she never really
thought she would be the one to end their

00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:04.009
friendship.

00:15:04.009 --> 00:15:07.940
Needy falls back to the bed and stabs the
box cutter deep into her heart.

00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:11.730
She watches as Jen takes her final breath,
taking in the fact that she had just killed

00:15:11.730 --> 00:15:13.470
her former best friend.

00:15:13.470 --> 00:15:18.800
Suddenly, the lights turn on and Jen’s mom
runs into the room, cradling her dead daughter.

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:22.740
At the correctional facility, Needy is still
in solitary confinement and everything is

00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:24.249
going according to plan.

00:15:24.249 --> 00:15:28.649
She’s not the same Needy anymore because
when you get bitten by a demon and you live,

00:15:28.649 --> 00:15:31.019
you absorb some of the demon’s abilities.

00:15:31.019 --> 00:15:34.869
She lands down from her meditation and breaks
down the facility’s walls and escapes by

00:15:34.869 --> 00:15:36.380
tearing the fence.

00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:40.870
As she walks down the road, she notices a
small creek nearby full of red balls and takes

00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:43.529
the knife that Nikolai used to stab Jen.

00:15:43.529 --> 00:15:47.139
It seems like everything at Devil’s Kettle
eventually resurfaces.

00:15:47.139 --> 00:15:51.660
As morning breaks, she flags down a car and
hitches a ride towards the east in Madison.

00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:54.920
She tells the driver she’s following this
rock band because it’s going to be their

00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:56.540
last show tonight.

00:15:56.540 --> 00:16:07.010
Later on, the police find all the members
of Low Shoulder dead in their hotel room.
