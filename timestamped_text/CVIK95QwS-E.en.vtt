00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.280
Story Recapped here. Today I'm going to explain&nbsp;
a drama, fantasy, romance, and science fiction&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.440
film called "The Time Traveler's Wife."&nbsp;
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:17.760
In the 1970s, Henry DeTamble is in the backseat&nbsp;
as his mom, Annette, drives while singing to him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.080
It’s Christmas Eve, and suddenly, a truck skids&nbsp;
out of control and collides with their car.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.840
While they spin out of control, Henry&nbsp;
notices himself slowly fading away.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.880
Confused by it, Annette could not&nbsp;
help but wonder why it's happening.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.960
Henry inadvertently travels two weeks back,&nbsp;
where he sees his parents reading a book to him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.280
In disbelief, Henry closes his eyes and travels&nbsp;
back to the present, where he sees their car crash&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.000
ultimately. Standing naked on the side of a road,&nbsp;
Henry is clothed by a man who claims to be Henry&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.040
as an adult. The older Henry comforts his younger&nbsp;
self and introduces the concept of time travel.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.440
Afterward, the older version of him fades into&nbsp;
thin air and arrives at a library where he works.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.040
The thing about his time travels is he ends&nbsp;
up naked in random places where he is drawn.

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.160
The following day, a woman named Clare Abshire&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.680
recognizes Henry at the library. She gazes at&nbsp;
him in complete amazement, but he has no clue&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.240
as to why. Clare informs Henry told her that&nbsp;
"this would happen," but he remains clueless.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.800
Instead, she invites him over to dinner at a local&nbsp;
restaurant so she could go further into detail.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.880
While he gets ready for their meeting, Henry&nbsp;
begins to fade again and ends up in a dark alley.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.240
When he arrives at the time and place he is&nbsp;
currently living, he steals clothes and pick&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.280
locks to get by. Unfortunately, he gets cornered&nbsp;
by a police officer after catching him trespass.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.800
But once Henry gets into the vehicle, the&nbsp;
police are stunned after seeing him disappear.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.120
Henry meets with Clare at the restaurant, and she&nbsp;
talks about how she has known him for most of her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.680
life. She brings out a diary where she logs&nbsp;
every time Henry visits her. Henry explains&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.040
that he visits certain places a lot because&nbsp;
significant events in his life pull him in,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.280
like gravity. Lovingly, Clare lets him know that&nbsp;
he is her best friend as she feels a sense of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.680
comfort whenever he visits. To end the night, both&nbsp;
of them go over to Henry's place, where they share&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.160
an intimate moment. That same night, Clare recalls&nbsp;
her first memory of meeting Henry at the meadow of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.480
her parents' house. She was six years old when she&nbsp;
met an older version of Henry naked in the woods&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.800
and gave him a blanket to cover up. Henry explains&nbsp;
to young Clare that he is a time traveler and will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.960
be friends in the future, but the little girl&nbsp;
is skeptical about it. Before he travels back,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.000
Henry tells the little girl that he will&nbsp;
return on Tuesday and asks her if she could&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
bring clothes for him. Clare remains unconvinced&nbsp;
until she sees him disappear before her eyes.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.640
The following day, Clare finds lipstick inside&nbsp;
Henry's medicine and doubts if their relationship&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.280
could last. Despite being happy with him, she had&nbsp;
only known the older, more mature Henry from her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.440
childhood, and Henry right now is in his twenties&nbsp;
and has his faults. Henry assures her that he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.760
is working on himself to be a better person,&nbsp;
developing a deeper relationship with Clare. One&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:38.160
night, she introduces Henry to her best friends,&nbsp;
Charisse and Gomez, who are in a relationship.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:43.200
Days after, Gomez stumbles upon a brawl in the&nbsp;
streets and finds out that Henry is part of it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.080
The concerned Gomez breaks the fight&nbsp;
and sees Henry in women's clothing,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.680
explaining that he fought because the other&nbsp;
guy is being discriminatory. Confused about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.520
the whole situation, Gomez questions Henry&nbsp;
about his involvement in the street fight.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.760
Henry finally reveals that he is a time traveler,&nbsp;
but Gomez gets more clueless about the situation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.680
Seeing Henry fade into thin air, Gomez is&nbsp;
lost for words and finally believes that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.680
he can time travel. As a good friend, Gomez&nbsp;
expresses his concerns to Clare about being&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.440
in a relationship with Henry. According&nbsp;
to him, it will not do her any good,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.400
but she defends herself and says that she&nbsp;
has been waiting for him her whole life.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.600
Meanwhile, Henry travels back to the time before&nbsp;
his mother's death, running into her on the train.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.440
He longingly opens a conversation to say that he&nbsp;
is a big fan of her singing and wishes that his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.120
girlfriend could get a chance to hear Annette's&nbsp;
voice. Both of them engage in small talk,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.880
and Annette says that she also has a son&nbsp;
named Henry. Before he leaves the train,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.560
Henry reminds Annette that her son loves&nbsp;
her so much, to which she replies, "I know."

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.720
Back to the present, Henry visits his withdrawn&nbsp;
father, Richard, to check on him. Richard was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.880
once a violinist, but he can no longer play due&nbsp;
to his drinking problems and failing health.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.280
Both get into a heated argument about Annette's&nbsp;
engagement ring, which Henry is asking for. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.520
father and son have not moved on from Annette's&nbsp;
death and still grieve on such a devastating loss.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.600
Before leaving, Richard entrusts the ring to his&nbsp;
son, making amends on their shaky relationship.

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:00.640
The following day, Henry sits by Clare's bed&nbsp;
and contemplates how to open the proposal.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.480
He simply slides his mother's ring on Clare's&nbsp;
finger and asks if she would marry him, to which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.640
she replies with a sweet "yes." After some time,&nbsp;
they prepare for the wedding and make their way to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.200
the Abshires' mansion. Clare's family welcomes&nbsp;
Henry, including her father, who is a hunter.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.880
To initiate a bond between them, Clare's father&nbsp;
invites Henry to go hunting with him one of these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.120
days, and he happily accepts the invitation.&nbsp;
Hours before the ceremony, Henry sees Richard,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.360
which is highly unexpected. He comes to his father&nbsp;
and gives him an embrace just as he gets ready.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.960
As Henry's best man, Gomez stays&nbsp;
with him throughout the preparation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.960
and notices that the groom has disappeared.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.120
Because Henry does not have control over his&nbsp;
travels, so Gomez falls into a state of panic.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.280
With the guests waiting outside, they are in&nbsp;
a critical situation, leaving him frantic.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:44.080
Out of nowhere, a much older Henry arrives and&nbsp;
wears the tux hurriedly. As if nothing happened,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.240
he arrives at the altar and longingly looks at&nbsp;
Clare while she walks beautifully down the aisle.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.760
She is surprised to see a future version of&nbsp;
Henry with gray hair, but they laugh it off.

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:56.800
At the wedding reception, the present-day Henry&nbsp;
shows up just in time for their first dance. Clare&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.560
looks at him with complete admiration as they&nbsp;
dance on stage in front of family and friends.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.400
The new bride and groom then jump on the bed&nbsp;
to celebrate the eventful day on their own.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.240
As they are having fun, Henry disappears&nbsp;
completely, leaving Clare alone in the room&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.480
on their honeymoon. Henry arrives at the meadow,&nbsp;
where he finds clothes prepared by the young Clare&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:16.720
for him. He finds Clare having a small picnic in&nbsp;
the open field and is offered a sandwich by the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:21.920
little girl. She asks him if he is married, and&nbsp;
after saying he is, Clare gets upset. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:25.840
Henry does not reveal that both of them end up&nbsp;
together in the future. Back in the present,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.360
Henry climbs to bed to cuddle and tease Clare&nbsp;
for being jealous of herself when she was young.

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.440
As time goes by, Clare and Henry live the&nbsp;
life of a young married couple as they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.600
move into their new apartment. Despite finding&nbsp;
happiness in each other, Henry's time-traveling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:42.160
puts a strain on their marriage. At times, he&nbsp;
unintentionally leaves Clare for days or weeks,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:46.480
but the situation is beyond his control. Clare&nbsp;
gets more upset about it as time progresses,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:50.080
but she willingly agreed to marry him after&nbsp;
all. Both get into an argument because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:53.600
Henry missed Christmas and New Year's Day,&nbsp;
leaving her lonely during the festive times.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.840
She then leaves for work, claiming that her&nbsp;
new art show is becoming too stressful for her.

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:02.880
That night, Henry waits for Clare outside the&nbsp;
art studio and brings her to a television store.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:07.040
Inside, they watch the lottery drawing, and Henry&nbsp;
hands Clare a lottery ticket with a set of numbers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:11.120
that he memorizes. After knowing the numbers that&nbsp;
will be called, they win an astounding amount of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:15.760
five million dollars. Henry then says, "There are&nbsp;
a lot of downsides to my condition, but this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:19.600
not one of them." It is more than enough for them&nbsp;
to purchase a spacious home that would accommodate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:24.000
Clare's hobby and passion which is painting. At&nbsp;
the new house, Gomez and a pregnant Charisse come&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
over for dinner. While preparing food, they hear&nbsp;
distant noises from the living room, and as they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.160
check, they could not believe what they see. They&nbsp;
run into a bleeding Henry, who seems to be on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:37.040
brink of death, even gasping for air. This version&nbsp;
of Henry is extremely wounded, but he disappears&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:41.120
abruptly. All of them are caught in disbelief,&nbsp;
but the present Henry simply walks away.

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:45.280
Later, Clare and Henry discuss what&nbsp;
they saw, but he seems uninterested,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:49.440
saying that he has no idea when and how he will&nbsp;
die. She expresses her worries because all her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:53.440
life, she has never seen an old Henry during&nbsp;
his time travels. It could mean that he died,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:57.920
but he is also hopeful that he will find a cure in&nbsp;
the near future. Before they end the conversation,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:00.960
Clare reveals that she is pregnant,&nbsp;
leaving Henry speechless and in tears.

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:05.600
While having a meal at a local restaurant, Clare&nbsp;
feels a tingling pain in her stomach and finds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:09.840
blood coming out of her. Before she could process&nbsp;
what is happening, another pain strikes her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:14.240
and she is brought to the hospital. Henry arrives,&nbsp;
and Clare lets him know that they lost the baby,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:18.320
thinking that it also time-traveled out of her&nbsp;
womb. Desperate to know more about his condition,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:23.200
Henry consults a geneticist named Dr.&nbsp;
Kendrick to help him with his problem. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:27.200
doctor performs a scan on him, but Henry time&nbsp;
travels again before they could complete it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:31.600
Eventually, Clare and Henry meet with Dr. Kendrick&nbsp;
to discuss the findings: Henry's travels are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:36.080
caused by a genetic chromosome mutation, which&nbsp;
means his child will likely have this problem too.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:39.440
The doctor recommends some medicine that could&nbsp;
calm the brain and body functions to prevent it. 
 &nbsp;

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:44.400
That night, Henry wakes up to see blood all over&nbsp;
their bed. He wakes Clare to break the news that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:48.640
she had another miscarriage. The reoccurring loss&nbsp;
is putting too much strain on their relationship,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:52.640
making them argue more often. All Clare wants&nbsp;
is to be a mother, but Henry's condition is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:56.800
stopping her from becoming one. This is Henry's&nbsp;
last straw; he does not want to put his wife&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:00.960
through the stress of miscarriage anymore, so&nbsp;
he has a vasectomy. The procedure is done behind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:05.840
his wife's back, and after the operation, he time&nbsp;
travels. Ending up in the meadow, an 18-year-old&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:09.840
Clare approaches him and is concerned about his&nbsp;
demeanor. Henry apologizes for doing something&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:14.560
she won't like, but he had to do. When the younger&nbsp;
Clare becomes insistent, Henry kisses her hard,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:18.320
upsetting the young lady because it is their&nbsp;
first kiss, and it does not feel special.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:21.680
To make up for it, Henry kisses her lovingly&nbsp;
before traveling back to the present.

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:26.640
As he arrives home, he already knows how the&nbsp;
conversation about his vasectomy will end like.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:30.560
He gathers up all the courage to tell Clare, and&nbsp;
she becomes speechless after hearing it. Henry&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:34.160
explains that he does not want his child to go&nbsp;
through what he experiences, like time-traveling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:38.320
without warning and being placed in dangerous&nbsp;
situations. Clare is devastated beyond words&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:42.000
and breaks down. She finds it difficult to come&nbsp;
to terms with the fact that she can never have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.720
a child with Henry. That night, the couple sleeps&nbsp;
in separate rooms because of their recent fight.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:51.200
Shortly after, Clare receives a phone call from&nbsp;
a young Henry who needs help in a parking garage.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:54.960
When he enters the car, Clare talks to him about&nbsp;
her problems with the future version of him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:58.640
and they share an intimate moment. 
 
Back in their home, Clare tells Henry what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:02.800
happened, and she explains that she did not cheat&nbsp;
on their marriage because it's still him. She also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:06.480
reveals that she is pregnant again, but she does&nbsp;
not get her hopes up to save herself from being&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:10.240
hurt this time. The couple schedules an ultrasound&nbsp;
appointment where they find out that they are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:14.400
having a baby girl. According to their doctor,&nbsp;
the baby is perfectly healthy, and they have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:18.720
nothing to worry about. Clare's current pregnancy&nbsp;
is the longest time she has kept the baby, so she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:23.040
decides to come up with a name. However, when they&nbsp;
brainstorm for a name for their future daughter,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:27.680
Henry time travels. He wakes up in a zoo without&nbsp;
any clothing and inside a glass cage, where people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:32.640
could see him outside. Upon making his way out,&nbsp;
a little girl yells, "Daddy!" so he turns around&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:38.240
and sees her come closer. She hugs Henry and&nbsp;
introduces herself as a 10-year-old Alba, saying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:43.040
that she misses him so much. At this point, Henry&nbsp;
is taken aback, realizing that Clare's pregnancy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:47.360
has been successful. Henry and Alba take a walk&nbsp;
outside, where Alba informs Henry that she can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:52.080
also time travel, but she can control it. Sadly,&nbsp;
she informs her father that he died when she was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:56.720
just five years old, which upsets him. They part&nbsp;
ways after Alba's teacher calls her back inside.

00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:01.680
In the present, Clare gives birth to a healthy&nbsp;
baby girl. She raises her in a happy home full&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:06.160
of love and laughter alongside their other family&nbsp;
members. On Alba's fifth birthday, Henry could not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:10.720
help but feel uneasy, remembering his conversation&nbsp;
with his daughter in the future. At the same time,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:14.560
he is preoccupied with preparations for the party&nbsp;
and thoughts of his death, when an older version&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:19.040
of Alba visits. She plays with her younger self&nbsp;
and tells her that Henry's days are numbered.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:23.840
In a cloudy mood, Alba returns to the house,&nbsp;
making Clare concerned. At the party, she also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:27.520
sees her daughter talking to Henry as if something&nbsp;
is upsetting Alba—a sight that bothers her all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:31.440
night. Later, Alba could not keep the secret&nbsp;
any longer and tells her mother that Henry's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:35.680
death is nearing. Clare accepts this harsh truth&nbsp;
and discusses it with Henry as she comforts him.

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:40.640
The following day, Henry time travels again,&nbsp;
only to return with hypothermia. He is rushed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:44.160
to the hospital after needing immediate&nbsp;
medical care as he is shrieking in pain.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:47.360
The worried Clare expresses her concerns&nbsp;
to Dr. Kendrick, saying that he could be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:52.000
helpless in his travels and die if Henry cannot&nbsp;
run. Later, Henry is confined to a wheelchair,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.760
and Alba comes to him to give tips on how&nbsp;
to control his travels. According to her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:55.760 --> 00:11:00.160
when she feels like fading, she sings to&nbsp;
herself. She practices with Henry, who feels&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:04.480
like he is about to go, but it is ineffective,&nbsp;
and he fades away. Henry wakes up in the snow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:08.160
and finds out that he will die on New Year's Eve&nbsp;
after seeing a tragic scene inside their house.

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:12.560
Weeks pass and Henry spends his remaining&nbsp;
days with his family during the holidays.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:16.160
He cherishes every moment he has with his wife&nbsp;
and daughter, who are the most important people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:20.080
in his life. On New Year's Eve, Claire&nbsp;
and Henry throw a party in their house,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:22.800
and they gather all their loved&nbsp;
ones together. After saying his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:26.800
goodbyes to Gomez and thanking him for their&nbsp;
friendship, Henry talks with Clare outside.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:30.880
She senses that something is amiss and realizes&nbsp;
that Henry's death is just around the corner.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:34.160
The both of them share their final moment&nbsp;
before the clock hits midnight. As the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:38.320
fireworks display begins, Henry fades into thin&nbsp;
air, leaving Clare alone on that cold night. 
 &nbsp;

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:43.440
Henry regains consciousness and finds himself in&nbsp;
the snowy woods next to the meadow. He sees a deer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:47.680
just beside him in the early hours of the day,&nbsp;
which immediately runs away after hearing a voice.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:51.920
Out of nowhere, a gun fires and hits Henry,&nbsp;
who disappears right at that instant.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:55.920
From the woods, Clare's father and brother&nbsp;
emerge, who are hunting. They arrive at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:55.920 --> 00:12:00.560
spot where Henry used to lie, which is now covered&nbsp;
in blood. Assuming that they just clipped a deer,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:03.760
the father and son have no idea that&nbsp;
they accidentally shot Clare's husband. 
 &nbsp;

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:07.600
Back in the present, Henry arrives at&nbsp;
the party, dying and out of breath.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:11.840
Clare, Alba, and the rest of the guests&nbsp;
run to him and slowly accept his fate.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:15.440
In his dying breath, Henry tells Clare&nbsp;
how much he loves her. Days pass,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:19.280
and Clare is still shaken by Henry's passing,&nbsp;
so Alba climbs to bed to comfort her mother.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.560
After some years, a nine-year-old Alba plays with&nbsp;
Gomez and Charisse's kids in the meadow. To her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:29.200
surprise, Henry comes out of the woods, welcoming&nbsp;
her with a big embrace. The other kids run back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:33.760
to the house to call Clare as Henry tells Alba how&nbsp;
he met her mother. Without any hesitations, Clare&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:37.760
runs to the meadow and hugs Henry as tight as&nbsp;
she could. She asks Henry why he didn't say he'd&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:41.760
be back in the meadow, to which he replies that&nbsp;
he does not want her to spend her life waiting.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:46.080
After their passionate kiss, Henry disappears once&nbsp;
again, imprinting a familiar feeling of loss on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:49.840
her. Clare picks up his clothes, and Alba comes&nbsp;
to her as they leave the meadow peacefully.
