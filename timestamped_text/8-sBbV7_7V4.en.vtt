00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.100
Welcome back to Movie Recaps.

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.930
Today I will show you a zombie horror film
from 2016, titled Train to Busan.

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.050
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:09.920
Watch out and take care.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.850
A truck approaches a quarantine zone and is
immediately met by personnel that disinfect

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:14.960
the vehicle.

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.310
The driver asks one of them what's going on
and he replies that there was a minor leak

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.740
in the biotech district, but that there should
be no big problems.

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.970
The driver continues and when he tries to
pick up his ringing phone he hits something

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:26.170
on the road.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:29.949
He gets out of the truck, seeing it's a dear,
but when he checks that his vehicle has not

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:31.980
bumps, he leaves it on the road.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.530
The animal comes back to life.

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.050
Seok-woo is at work, talking to a client on
the phone and discussing the sale of certain

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:39.050
stocks.

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.609
He scrolls a news site with reports on the
mysterious deaths of the fish in a reservoir

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:44.370
when his assistant walks in.

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.210
Seok-woo tells him to sell all the stocks
from that company.

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:52.089
Later, he parks his car and argues with his
ex-wife on the phone about Soo-an, their daughter.

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:55.530
The girl wants to visit her mom the next day
for her birthday, but he doesn't want to let

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.789
her go alone.

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.199
He arrives home, where his mother opens the
door for him.

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:03.600
Walking into the girl's room he finds her
talking to her mom on the phone, saying that

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.370
she can take the train alone.

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:06.800
She hears him and hangs up.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.620
Seok-woo sits next to Soo-an and asks her
to wait a week until he has less work so he

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.140
can take her to Busan.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.300
He gives her the birthday present early.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.570
She opens it, but it turns out she already
has that same thing that he got for her before.

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.730
He asks her what else would she want and she
tells him that she wants to go see her mommy.

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.580
Soo-an says that she'll go alone so that she
doesn't waste his time.

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.480
Seok-woo and his mom talk about the girl.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.050
She tells him to have a heart-to-heart with
his wife when he does go to Busan.

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.350
He tells her that it's a crucial period for
him at work, but his mom says that it's a

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.330
crucial period in Soo-an's life too, then
leaves him with a camera that has a recording

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.530
of the girl's recital he didn't go to.

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.430
Seok-woo watches the video and sees how much
she is hurting, so he decides to take her

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:46.430
there.

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.450
In the car, he talks to Soo-an about the recital,
trying to make a life lesson out of it, when

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.760
he almost hits an ambulance on the road.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.460
They stop and watch an entire cordon drive
by.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.550
Suddenly, the girl notices soot falling from
the sky and a distant fire can be seen in

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:01.440
the reflection of the car.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.740
At the station, the train to Busan is getting
ready to depart.

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.200
The conductor walks in his cabin and the attendants
prepare as well.

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.980
The coach of a baseball team tells everyone
to sit down, but they see one of their cheerleaders

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.209
walk in and cheer.

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:17.959
In-gil offers Jong-gil a boiled egg, just
as Seok-woo and his daughter board the train.

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:21.019
He calls his work and tells them he'll be
back before lunch.

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:24.019
Before the train leaves, a hurt girl runs
into the car.

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:27.329
As it departs, Soo-an sees a man attack a
station worker.

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:30.189
The girl that entered the train has a bite
mark on her leg.

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:33.569
Yon-suk tells one of the attendants that an
odd man jumped the train and that he's been

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:35.400
in the bathroom for a while.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.870
Soo-an is curious and goes to see what's happening.

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.480
The man keeps saying that everyone is dead,
but the attendant doesn't understand what

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.560
he means and tries to convince him to get
out of the bathroom.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.529
The bitten girl walks through the train and
faints, but no one seems to notice her.

00:02:48.529 --> 00:02:52.090
Soo-an wants to go to the bathroom, but runs
into Sang-hwa who's guarding the door for

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.040
his wife and tells her to go to another one
in the next car.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.769
The female attendant finds the bitten girl
convulsing and immediately calls for medical

00:02:58.769 --> 00:02:59.769
assistance.

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:03.969
Seok-woo is awoken by his phone, when he notices
that Soo-an is missing.

00:03:03.969 --> 00:03:06.999
His assistant tells him that something is
happening nationwide.

00:03:06.999 --> 00:03:09.129
He hangs up and goes to look for the girl.

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:12.639
The passengers on the car watch the chaos
unraveling on the TV.

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:16.230
The attendant keeps calling her chief and
the bitten girl stands up, fully turned into

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:17.319
a zombie.

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:20.930
Her chief runs toward the car when she doesn't
answer and Soo-an enters a toilet.

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.010
The girl is on the attendant's back, biting
her as they walk into a car, frightening the

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:26.010
others.

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.269
The baseball team gets attacked next and the
attendant turns as well.

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:30.790
All hell breaks loose.

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.269
The chief attendant tells the passengers from
the next car to run.

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:38.010
Meanwhile, Seok-woo looks for his daughter,
but before he can find her he notices something

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.840
going on in the other car.

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.780
Soo-an hears the screams too.

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.700
People run past them both and the father watches
the chief being attacked by the zombie attendant

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.540
and the chief turns quickly.

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.569
Soo-an appears behind her dad, he grabs her
and runs as they are being chased by a mountain

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:53.890
of zombies throughout the train.

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.780
Sang-hwa tells his pregnant wife Seong-kyeong
to hurry when he notices something happening.

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.340
A zombie bites into a woman in front of them
and at the behest of Seong-kyeong he tries

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.019
to help, but gets attacked.

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:07.579
Seok-woo runs into the next car, while Sang-hwa
locks the zombie in the bathroom.

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:10.900
He tells his wife to run, but soon the other
zombies arrive.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.439
The rest are still watching it all unfold
on TV as people from the other cars run inside.

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:19.510
Seok-woo gets the door, closing it before
Seong-kyeong's face.

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:22.890
Sang-hwa manages to fight off a zombie and
they enter the car, closing the door before

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:23.890
the things can come in.

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:27.820
Seok-woo notices that the zombies don't know
how to open the door and tells the man to

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.040
let it go.

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.850
He's also realized that they attacked when
they saw them, so Seong-kyeong covers the

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.420
door, effectively pacifying the zombies.

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:39.160
The conductor makes an announcement that they
won't be stopping in the next town, so Yon-suk

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.260
talks to him on an intercom asking him if
he even knows what's happening in the train.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.600
He says that the order came from the control
center.

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.130
Seok-woo gets a call from his mom because
she's worried for them.

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:51.150
She tells him to take care of his daughter.

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.460
The woman turns while on the phone with him.

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.580
Seok-woo realizes what has happened, but doesn't
tell Soo-an.

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:00.710
The train slows down and people from the station
they're passing begin to bang on the windows,

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:03.740
begging for help, while zombies attack and
eat them.

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:07.680
In a public announcement, a government official
informs the citizens that violent riots have

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.220
broken out in several major cities, resulting
in many deaths.

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:14.060
The government has closed down many major
districts.

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:18.220
The people on the train check social media
and see videos of people being attacked.

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:22.530
The announcement continues informing the citizens
that a state of emergency has been declared.

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:27.050
The official states that the citizens shouldn't
trust fake news, to stay calm and at home.

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:30.690
He assures the people that their safety isn't
in danger, as cities burn.

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:34.720
The people in the train have cordoned off
the door and are moving in the opposite direction.

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:38.140
Soo-an tells her dad that her mom's phone
isn't working, so he sits her down while he

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:39.270
tries calling.

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:44.220
In-gil makes Jong-gil take the seat next to
them, so the girl gives In-gil her own seat.

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:47.360
Sang-hwa sees the father and kid approach
and he's still angry that he shut the doors

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:48.640
in their face earlier.

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:52.550
Seok-woo scolds the girl for being selfless,
telling her that she needs to take care of

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:55.150
herself first in situations like these.

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:58.440
Another announcement from the conductor informs
them that they will be stopping at a station

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.220
where the military has been deployed to secure
their train.

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:05.110
Seok-woo overhears Yon-suk asking someone
on the phone which cities can be entered and

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:08.190
it seems that the one they will be stopping
in isn't on the list.

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:12.280
He tells his daughter to stay where she is
and goes to the other car to make a call.

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:15.780
Sang-hwa asks the girl about her father and
when she tells him that he's a fund manager,

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:18.190
he comments that it means that he's a bloodsucker.

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:22.070
The kid agrees and his wife tries to lighten
the moon by giving her some candy.

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:25.100
Then she tells her to say "hi" to her baby
and touch the belly.

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:26.480
Soo-an feels it kick.

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:29.220
Seok-woo calls a client that he thinks can
help.

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:32.720
He asks him about the city that they'll stop
at and the man tells Seok-woo that once they

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.670
arrive they'll be quarantined.

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:37.770
When Seok-woo tells him that his daughter
is with him and he'll do him a favor if he

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:41.900
helps them, the man says not to go to the
main square, but to the East one.

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:43.170
He'll let his men know.

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:45.670
Seok-woo sees the homeless man in the car.

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:49.900
Later, the train arrives to the city where
the military should be waiting, but no one

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:50.920
is there.

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:54.711
Yon-suk pushes his way out first and all the
others follow, including Seok-woo and his

00:06:54.711 --> 00:06:55.711
girl.

00:06:55.711 --> 00:06:59.670
The remaining kids from the baseball team
walk out of the train with baseball bats.

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:03.130
One of the attendants takes the conductor
to see the zombie car, when Yon-suk meets

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:06.610
them and tells them that Busan is one of the
only cities left open.

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:10.340
He tells the conductor to uncouple the zombie
car, but it can't be done.

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:13.850
The conductor agrees that they should go to
Busan directly, but wants to bring back the

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:15.730
passengers to the train first.

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:18.660
Meanwhile, the passengers are walking into
the empty station.

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:23.080
Seok-woo enters a cordoned area with Soo-an,
so they can go to the East square.

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:26.860
The homeless man follows them because he heard
his call and wants to come with them.

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:30.760
Soo-an wants to tell the others and gets sad
because her father doesn't let her do it.

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:34.650
As the rest of the passengers go down the
escalator, Sang-hwa notices something strange

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:35.870
about the station.

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:40.140
Simultaneously, a man appears at the end of
the hallway where Seok-woo and Soo-an are

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:42.690
standing, so the homeless man runs after him.

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:45.940
Seok-woo tells Soo-an to stay there and goes
after them too.

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:49.460
When the passengers arrive at the bottom of
the escalator, the military is revealed to

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:51.430
be fully turned into zombies.

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:53.740
The horde attacks the passengers.

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:57.360
Sang-hwa sees it happening in time and gets
his wife on the stairs so they can escape.

00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:01.210
Seok-woo gets a call from his client saying
that he can't reach his men, when a zombie

00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:04.140
appears behind the officer in the hallway
and attacks him.

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:07.320
The homeless man slips as more zombies appear
and eat the officer.

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:12.160
Seok-woo runs back to Soo-an, who almost gets
eaten, but Sang-hwa saves her.

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:14.170
Seong-kyeong gets her and they run away together.

00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:17.550
The baseball team waits for them at the door
and once they come in they close it.

00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:21.340
Seok-woo struggles to get a zombie off of
him, when the homeless man helps him and runs

00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:23.000
toward the door.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.200
Sang-hwa sees him and opens it, then keeps
it open for Seok-woo.

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:29.540
They all push the door closed together, trying
to lock it.

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:32.419
Seong-kyeong is almost at the train when she
sees that some of the passengers are being

00:08:32.419 --> 00:08:34.390
decimated by the train horde.

00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:38.099
They still run down the stairs and passengers
enter the train from the other side.

00:08:38.099 --> 00:08:42.570
Suddenly, the station horde breaks through
the windows, falling onto the train.

00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:46.730
One zombie falls over Jong-gil, but fortunately
it's too broken up to get to her.

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:50.400
Seong-kyeong and Soo-an take the other sister
in the opposite direction, while the zombie

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:51.800
chasses after them.

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:54.920
Jong-gil is saved by an attendant and the
cheerleader.

00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:57.510
They get into the train, just in the nick
of time.

00:08:57.510 --> 00:09:01.200
The other sister, the girl and pregnant woman
get into another car and let the homeless

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:03.760
man inside before the zombies get to him.

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:07.050
The zombies surround the train so Yon-suk
tells the attendant that they have to go if

00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:08.560
they are to survive.

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:12.130
The cheerleader says they can't because her
friends are still out there, but the attendant

00:09:12.130 --> 00:09:14.220
calls the conductor and tells him to depart.

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:17.140
Meanwhile, Sang-hwa finally locks the door.

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:20.770
Suddenly, the horde breaks through the glass
as the men are running away.

00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:24.670
They see that the train is moving and hurry,
but when they get to the base of the stairs,

00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:27.580
two of the baseball players are picked off
by the zombies.

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:31.510
The last one freezes, but Seok-woo gets him
up and running, then inside the train in no

00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:32.790
time.

00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:36.660
Sang-hwa lags behind and Seok-woo extends
his hand to him, but the man picks up a baton

00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:39.850
and shield, saving him from incoming zombies
instead.

00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:42.120
He eventually gets inside the train too.

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:45.930
Meanwhile, the conductor calls the control
center and asks if there's an open path to

00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:47.000
Busan.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.570
He's advised to continue there, but he asks
to be informed when contact has been made

00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:51.570
with the station.

00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:55.140
Seong-kyeong and the others are caught between
two zombie cars.

00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:58.440
She sees an open toilet and signals the others
to join.

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:01.870
Everyone gets inside and when Seong-kyeong
steps in a zombie attacks her.

00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:05.330
They barely hold off the door, when the other
zombies follow.

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:08.900
Inside the other part of the train, some of
the people are covering the glass doors, when

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:12.330
the conductor makes an announcement that they
will be headed straight to Busan.

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:15.690
The cheerleader gets a call from the last
baseball player and he says he's sorry because

00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:16.990
no one else survived.

00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:21.410
Simultaneously, Seok-woo is trying to reach
his daughter, when suddenly he hears Sang-hwa

00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:23.300
talking to her on his phone.

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:26.310
She tells him that they're trapped in a toilet
in car 13.

00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:29.540
The baseball player tells them that the rest
are in car 15.

00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:32.010
The men prepare to rescue the others.

00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:36.010
Sang-hwa plans out their strategy, putting
himself upfront, the boy in the middle and

00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:37.100
Seok-woo in the back.

00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:38.970
They'll wait till they pass the tunnel.

00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:42.860
The zombies spot them immediately and the
three of them go in fighting.

00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:46.960
Sang-hwa begins killing zombies with his bare
hands and Seok-woo helps him from his flank.

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:50.660
The boy uses his bat as a weapon and they
fight as a unstoppable team.

00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:54.700
The next car is full of zombie baseball players
and the boy freezes up.

00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:57.080
Sang-hwa pushes him away and fights the zombies.

00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:00.070
Seok-woo finds one of their bats and tries
to fight them off.

00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:04.090
The two of them are deadlocked with the baseball
zombies and the boy can't do anything.

00:11:04.090 --> 00:11:08.110
Suddenly, they pass through another tunnel
and the zombies begin acting strangely.

00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:12.500
Seok-woo makes a noise with the bat which
the zombies follow and they are able to escape.

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:15.650
The train passes the tunnel in the moment
they go through the doors and the zombies

00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:16.650
attack again.

00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:21.130
They rest between cars, when Seok-woo gets
an idea to use their phones as decoys once

00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:22.980
the train goes through a tunnel.

00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:26.220
They enter the car in the darkness when the
zombies can't see them and Seok-woo throws

00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:28.500
Sang-hwa's phone in the back of the car.

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:32.040
He calls it and the zombies flock to it, so
they escape without fighting.

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:35.100
They reach the toilet and everyone is happy
to see each other.

00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:38.820
The baseball player finds another toilet and
when they pass the tunnel he gets the others

00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:39.820
inside.

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:43.110
Seok-woo has figured out how long they have
to the next tunnel and the boy texts his girl

00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:44.650
in car 15.

00:11:44.650 --> 00:11:48.390
The cheerleader is happy that he'll be arriving
at their car alive so she shares it with the

00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:49.390
others.

00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:53.390
Yon-suk naturally doesn't like the fact that
their coming, since they might be infected.

00:11:53.390 --> 00:11:55.730
The rest of the people seem to agree with
him.

00:11:55.730 --> 00:11:59.370
She begs the attendant to help her make the
others understand, but he agrees with Yon-suk

00:11:59.370 --> 00:12:00.580
as well.

00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:04.029
Once the train reaches a tunnel everyone gets
out of the toilets, but now they'll have to

00:12:04.029 --> 00:12:06.630
figure out how to get past the zombies.

00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:08.279
Everyone crawls through the luggage racks.

00:12:08.279 --> 00:12:12.280
Seok-woo diverts the attention of the zombies
and they get down in the car.

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:13.870
Then move in the next car.

00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:16.880
The homeless man falls over and Seok-woo goes
to help him.

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:19.700
They both get stranded in the car when the
train passes the tunnel.

00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:24.290
Seok-woo counts down until they run, but the
homeless man steps on a soda can and attracts

00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:25.570
the zombies.

00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:29.300
They still get through the door, but Sang-hwa
ends up holding it, because a zombie gets

00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:30.440
lodged in it.

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:34.290
The baseball player calls to his girl in the
other car because that door is locked.

00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:37.930
The people from car 15 have sealed the door
from their side and keep the girl from telling

00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:38.930
them that.

00:12:38.930 --> 00:12:43.240
Seok-woo goes over to help Sang-hwa, as the
boy tries to smash the other door.

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:45.750
Suddenly, a zombie bites Sang-hwa.

00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:49.500
They finally smash the door to the other car
and the baseball player tries to come in,

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:51.390
but Yon-suk holds the door.

00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:55.980
As the other men try to help him, Jong-gil
and the cheerleader fight them from the inside.

00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:59.430
Seong-kyeong begins walking to her husband,
but he tells her to stay away, then tells

00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:02.480
Seok-woo to take her and leave because he's
getting tired.

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:05.590
Sang-hwa asks him to take care of her and
Seok-woo says he's sorry.

00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:08.770
Suddenly, the door breaks apart and the two
have to go.

00:13:08.770 --> 00:13:12.540
Sang-hwa doesn't go down without a fight and
keeps he zombies at bay.

00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:14.690
The others open the door and come inside.

00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:18.899
Seok-woo grabs his daughter and Seong-kyeong,
but doesn't get to In-gil in time.

00:13:18.899 --> 00:13:22.950
He closes the door and immediately attacks
Yon-suk, calling him a bastard.

00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:27.540
Yon-suk says that Seok-woo is infected and
the attendant tells them to move in the vestibule.

00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:30.340
The passengers from car 15 all tell them to
get out.

00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:32.130
The homeless man goes first.

00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:36.270
The cheerleader doesn't want to stay with
them so she goes with the baseball player.

00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:39.350
Seong-kyeong tells Soo-an that they should
go too and Seok-woo follows.

00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:41.690
The others seal them inside the vestibule.

00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:45.170
Jong-gil sees her zombie sister on the other
side of the door and opens it before anyone

00:13:45.170 --> 00:13:46.410
can stop her.

00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:49.570
The passengers from car 15 get stormed by
the zombies.

00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:53.650
Meanwhile, the conductor calls in to ask about
the situation in Busan.

00:13:53.650 --> 00:13:56.730
He doesn't get an answer, but sees fires burning
in the city.

00:13:56.730 --> 00:13:59.100
Seok-woo finally talks to his daughter.

00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:01.470
He says that he'll take her to her mom for
her birthday.

00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:05.890
Later, Seok-woo gets a call from his assistant
who tells him that Busan has the best defense

00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:07.280
of all the cities.

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:10.380
He also tells him that the virus started in
one of their companies.

00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:13.310
The train breaks suddenly, because there's
a blockade.

00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:16.540
The conductor makes an announcement that he'll
find another train to get the remaining people

00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:17.720
to Busan.

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:20.880
Yon-suk and the attendant have survived the
zombie attack.

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:24.320
The conductor checks the first train he sees,
but since it's filled with zombies he goes

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:25.640
to find another one.

00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:28.750
Seok-woo tells the rest that they have to
move and find a way to Busan.

00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:32.380
Meanwhile, the conductor keeps looking for
another train.

00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:34.300
He finds an empty one and moves it.

00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:36.940
Yon-suk and the attendant are stuck in the
toilet.

00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:40.610
He tells the attendant to go first and pushes
him into the zombies to escape.

00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:45.300
Meanwhile, a burning car hurls into the trains
where the survivors are and separates them.

00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:48.710
The baseball player gets the cheerleader in
a train and while he tries to break open the

00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:52.990
door, Yon-suk enters, sacrificing the girl
and leaving the baseball player to fight off

00:14:52.990 --> 00:14:54.190
the zombie.

00:14:54.190 --> 00:14:56.640
He escapes and the boy gets rid of the zombie.

00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:59.380
The girl begins to turn in his arms and then
bites him.

00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:01.630
Meanwhile, Soo-an wakes Seok-woo.

00:15:01.630 --> 00:15:05.690
The two of them, Seong-kyeong and the homeless
man are trapped under a zombie car.

00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:09.399
Yon-suk runs toward the moving train and when
the conductor tries to help him, he leaves

00:15:09.399 --> 00:15:10.740
him behind too.

00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:14.180
The train car keeps collapsing, but Seok-woo
finds a way out.

00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:16.930
As he turns to pull the others out, the gap
caves in.

00:15:16.930 --> 00:15:20.570
The zombies break through the windows of the
train car and the homeless man tries to stop

00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:22.240
them from getting to the girls.

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:26.390
Seok-woo opens up the gap again and the two
of them get out, leaving the man behind.

00:15:26.390 --> 00:15:30.380
Seong-kyeong, Seok-woo and the kid run away
from the horde and after the moving train

00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:31.420
car.

00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:35.480
All the zombies from the station run toward
the car, piling on top of each other.

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:38.330
They all get on the train, but so do the zombies.

00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:42.430
They're holding tight to it and Seok-woo tries
to get them off, succeeding eventually.

00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:45.890
The three of them look for the conductor,
but find a half-turned Yon-suk in the cabin

00:15:45.890 --> 00:15:46.930
instead.

00:15:46.930 --> 00:15:48.620
He manages to open the door.

00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:52.430
Seok-woo tells him that he's infected and
when the turn is complete, he begins to attack

00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:53.430
them.

00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:56.310
Seok-woo fights him and Seong-kyeong gets
him off his back.

00:15:56.310 --> 00:15:58.620
The man grabs Yon-suk and he bites him.

00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:02.089
Seok-woo chains himself on the train, then
flings the man off.

00:16:02.089 --> 00:16:05.860
He realizes that his bitten, so before he
turns he gets both of them inside the cabin

00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:07.880
and tells them where the breaks must be.

00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:12.070
Seok-woo tells Soo-an to stay with Seong-kyeong
and get to Busan where it's safe.

00:16:12.070 --> 00:16:15.990
She can't let him go, but he releases himself
from the girl's grip before he can turn and

00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:19.790
exits the cabin, leaving her behind crying
and screaming after him.

00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:23.920
As he begins to turn into a zombie he remembers
the day that Soo-an was born, then jumps off

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:25.070
the train car.

00:16:25.070 --> 00:16:28.800
Seong-kyeong and Soo-an have to stop and leave
the train because there's a blockade on the

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:29.800
tracks.

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:32.420
They continue on foot through the ruble and
the bodies.

00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:34.190
The two enter a dark tunnel.

00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:35.750
The military is on the other side.

00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:39.130
A sniper has them in aim, but he can't tell
if they're infected.

00:16:39.130 --> 00:16:43.820
An order comes to kill them, when suddenly
Soo-an starts singing her recital song.

00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:48.690
The soldiers make the call that survivors
are approaching.
