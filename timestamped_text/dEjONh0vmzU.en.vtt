00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.400
Hello Ladies and Gentlemen and welcome to another episode of Cinema Summary.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.500
Today we'll be looking at The Lord of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien; a hallmark of the Fantasy genre.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:20.300
If you’ve ever heard of elves, orcs, dwarves, you've probably heard of it from somewhere or something

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.300
inspired directly or indirectly by the Lord of the Rings and the works of J.R.R. Tolkien

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:29.300
Adapted by Peter Jackson and released in 2001, The Fellowship of The Ring is the first movie in a trilogy

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.100
Now, if you're ready for an adventure, here's Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.880
In the Second Age of Middle-earth, the lords
of Elves, Dwarves, and Men are given Rings

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.200
of Power.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.820
Unbeknownst to them, the Dark Lord Sauron
forges the One Ring in Mount Doom to conquer

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.190
them all, abandoning a great part of his power
to it in order to dominate, through it, at

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.790
a distance, the other Rings and conquer Middle-earth.

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:59.360
A final coalition of men and elves battle
Sauron’s forces in Mordor, where Prince

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.420
Isildur of Gondor cuts the One Ring off of
Sauron's finger, thereby destroying his physical

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:05.420
form.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.210
Unfortunately, Isildur decides to take care
of the Ring himself, but the evil influence

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:17.410
of the Ring corrupts Isildur, preventing him
from destroying it in Mount Doom.

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:24.360
Isildur is later killed by Orcs, and the Ring
is lost for 2,500 years, found and owned by

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.390
Gollum for five centuries.

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.990
The Ring is then found by a Hobbit named Bilbo
Baggins.

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:37.000
Sixty years later, Bilbo celebrates his 111th
birthday in the Shire, reuniting with his

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.150
old friend, Gandalf the Grey.

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.290
Bilbo reveals that he intends on leaving the
Shire for one last adventure, and leaves his

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.760
inheritance to his nephew, Frodo, including
the Ring.

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.890
Although Bilbo has begun to become corrupted
by the Ring and tries to take it for himself,

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:53.310
Gandalf intervenes.

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.740
Telling Frodo to keep the Ring hidden, he
investigates it, and discovers its true identity,

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.580
returning to warn Frodo.

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.971
Learning that Gollum was tortured by Orcs,
and told them that Bilbo took the Ring, Gandalf

00:02:05.971 --> 00:02:11.660
instructs Frodo to leave the Shire, accompanied
by his gardener Samwise Gamgee.

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.350
Gandalf rides to Isengard, meeting fellow
wizard Saruman the White, but learns that

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.851
he is in cahoots with Sauron, who has unleashed
the Ringwraiths to find Frodo.

00:02:18.851 --> 00:02:19.851
After a brief battle, Saruman imprisons Gandalf.

00:02:19.851 --> 00:02:23.170
Frodo and Sam are joined by fellow Hobbits,
Merry and Pippin, and they evade the Ringwraiths,

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:31.690
arriving in Bree, where they are meant to
meet Gandalf, but are instead aided by a ranger

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.730
named Strider, a friend of Gandalf's, who
escorts them to Rivendell.

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.160
A few things: #1 the actor for Saruman the
White (Christopher Lee) was the only member

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.910
of the crew and cast who actually met the
author of LOTR, J.R.R.

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.700
Tolkien and had read LORD once year until
his death in 2015.

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.270
His friendship and knowledge of LOTR helped
shape the film with his inputs here-and-there.

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:51.240
He originally auditioned for Gandalf but landed
the role for Saruman, a role which Jackson

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.209
always had Lee in mind.

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:58.860
The Hobbits are ambushed by the Ringwraiths,
one stabbing Frodo with a cursed Morgul blade.

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.580
Arwen, an elf and Strider’s lover, comes
to Frodo’s aid, and successfully takes him

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.069
to Rivendell, where he is healed, meeting
Gandalf, who escaped Saruman on the back of

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:09.319
a giant Eagle.

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:14.220
Arwen’s father, Lord Elrond, holds a council,
deciding that the Ring must be destroyed in

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.290
Mount Doom.

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.900
While the members argue, Frodo volunteers
to take the Ring, accompanied by Gandalf,

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:26.580
Sam, Merry, Pippin, elf Legolas, dwarf Gimli,
Boromir of Gondor, and Strider, who is revealed

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:31.880
to be Aragorn, Isildur’s heir and rightful
King of Gondor.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.910
Bilbo gives Frodo his sword, Sting.

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:42.280
The Fellowship of the Ring sets off, but Saruman’s
magic forces them to travel through the Mines

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.650
of Moria, much to Gandalf's chagrin.

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.069
The Fellowship find out that the dwarves within
Moria have been slain, and they are attacked

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:54.020
by Orcs and a cave troll.

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:57.540
They defeat them, but are confronted by an
ancient demon called a Balrog.

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.599
Gandalf casts the Balrog into a vast chasm,
but its fiery whip drags Gandalf down into

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:03.670
the darkness with it.

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.930
The rest of the Fellowship, now in command
by Aragorn, reach Lothlórien, home to elves

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:09.820
Galadriel and Celeborn.

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:14.200
Galadriel privately informs Frodo that only
he can complete the quest, and one of his

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.410
friends will try to take the Ring.

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:20.750
Meanwhile, Saruman creates an army of Uruk-hai
to track down and kill the Fellowship.

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:21.889
Viggo Mortensen, the actor for Aragorn, is
an interesting figure for the film.

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:22.889
He was actually called in late into production
to replace actor Stuart Townsend who was supposed

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:23.889
to portray Aragorn.

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:24.889
His first scene being the battle at Weathertop
after the company leave Bree.

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:25.889
He was one of the few actors who did participate
in sword training unlike the other key actors,

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:26.889
but the swordmaster Bob Anderson, a former
Fencer who’d been working in film and TV

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:27.889
for at least 30 years training actors for
sword combat, said Mortensen was “the best

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:28.889
swordsman he trained”.

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:29.889
The man would get so intense that other stuntfolk
would be afraid to be in fight scenes due

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:30.889
to his intensity, and the man did his own
stunts.

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:31.889
The Fellowship leave Lothlórien by river
to Parth Galen.

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:32.889
Frodo wanders off, and is confronted by Boromir,
who tries to take the Ring in desperation.

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:34.840
Afraid of the Ring corrupting his friends,
Frodo decides to travel to Mordor alone.

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.400
The other members fight off the Uruk-hai,
but Merry and Pippin are taken captive, and

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.720
Boromir is mortally wounded by the Uruk chieftain.

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.919
After slaying the chieftain, Aragorn watches
Boromir die peacefully.

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:51.160
Sam follows Frodo, accompanying him to keep
his promise to Gandalf to protect Frodo, while

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.529
Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli go to rescue Merry
and Pippin.
