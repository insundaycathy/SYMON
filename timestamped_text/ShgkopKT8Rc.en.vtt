00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.320
Welcome to the breakdown where we breakdown all&nbsp;the messed-up movies! Last Monday you all voted&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:19.520
for Gerald s Game, and so . What do you think I m&nbsp;
stupid?!? Script KIDDIE! 4000 people did not vote,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.400
someone just botted in votes so that Threads&nbsp;
would win Even though it was at the bottom. I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:30.880
was watching the poll pal! The funny thing is that&nbsp;
Gerald s Game still won. We will get to them all,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:37.840
don t trip! Gerald s Game is the film adaption to&nbsp;
the Stephen King novel long thought best read. 
&nbsp;

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:44.080
Jessie and her husband Gerald are ready for&nbsp;
a romantic weekend secluded away. Truth is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:50.080
that these two have not done anything together in&nbsp;
months, so some handcuffs might spice things up!&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:57.120
It would be a shame if something were to happen to&nbsp;
Gerald, leaving Jessie locked to the bed! Would it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:03.920
be a shame though? Maybe this is just what Jessie&nbsp;
needs to confront the pains of her life! This&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.280
movie is easily on Netflix so if you want to watch&nbsp;
it yourself, go right ahead! If you want to see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.080
what happens, including all the messed-up parts,&nbsp;
stay tuned for the breakdown! Cue the Gohan!
&nbsp;

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:26.320
Bring it on home! That is the song playing in the&nbsp;
beginning! A lady is packing her bags along with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.840
her husband! Handcuffs going in too! If police&nbsp;
don t have them, then they must be for knocking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.960
boots (having sex)! They drive through a beautiful&nbsp;
forest. It reminds me of the drive the family did&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.480
at the beginning of Funny Games! She s a pretty&nbsp;
lady too, her name is Jessie. Maybe she had a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.720
few spy kids in a previous marriage.
She doesn t like that song playing,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:52.560
Bring it on home! You can sense a little baggage&nbsp;
she is constantly carrying! Gerald! Watch out for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.720
the dog! He must really be thinking about playing&nbsp;
that game of his! This dog is starving, eating an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:04.560
opossum. That dog look like he is visiting&nbsp;
Earth. Anyway, the couple reach the cabin.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:11.280
She goes walking around the beautiful scenery!&nbsp;
Man, as you get older, you can t beat this.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.800
Damn, refrigerator pre-stocked! She&nbsp;
sets out some meat for that stray dog,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.960
but he s not really around right now!
Gerald takes his first Viagra for the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:30.480
day meanwhile. Oh, never mind that dog is here.&nbsp;
Walking up kind of scary! Gerald scares the mutt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:37.280
away! It s time for some fine lovin ! They rush&nbsp;
inside for sex but they leave the door wide open.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.080
She gets into her new gown and takes&nbsp;
the tag off on the shelf above the bed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:48.560
She wasn t expecting real handcuffs and is&nbsp;
attached to both bed frames. This is the first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.000
time they are doing something like this btw. 
She also wasn t expecting Gerald to start a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.440
rape fantasy roleplay. It s a little tough for&nbsp;
her to get into the roleplay and she has to fight&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:05.040
him off. See y all should have organized a safe&nbsp;
word first! Either way, she doesn t like this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:11.040
at all. They get into an argument. This visit&nbsp;
was to try stuff out, make things more exciting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.800
after he doesn t touch her for months. When&nbsp;
they finally do something, turns out he has some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:22.000
weird rape fantasy. Seems its getting pretty&nbsp;
common though, but you gotta communicate.
&nbsp;

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.840
She asks him to unlock the cuffs but he keeps&nbsp;
going! She s gotta kick him away at some points!&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:34.320
We were happy once , but right before he keeps&nbsp;
talking, he s in huge pain! He can t even do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:42.080
anything but fall out! Gerald s having a heart&nbsp;
attack! Gerald dies leaving her locked to the bed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:47.600
with no escape! A sex nightmare&nbsp;
from hell! Gerald is dead ma am!&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:52.800
Dead! You better do what George Costanza did,&nbsp;
because it looks like you ll be next in line!
&nbsp;

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:58.800
Jessie is hoping it s a joke, but its really&nbsp;
not. He s already at the pearly gates by now.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:06.160
He hit his head on the way down, confirming he s&nbsp;
dead for real! She s like Oh eff! at this point!&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.960
Hours start to pass! Gerald is dead on the&nbsp;
floor, but she hears something creeping&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:17.120
outside! You can recall that they left the door&nbsp;
wide open! So, whatever it is feels invited!&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:23.840
Pitter patter, pitter patter! It s that stray dog&nbsp;
from earlier, looking for seconds of that meat!&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:29.840
Jessie is pretty sarcastic in this situation.&nbsp;
Peter Parker level quips while locked up. That&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:36.720
stray dog is so hungry, that it literally bites&nbsp;
chunks out of Gerald s arm before running away!&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:43.360
It boldly eats the chunks of Gerald right in&nbsp;
front of her! But then this dude Gerald gets up!&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:50.320
Wait! Gerald was alive all along? He s responding&nbsp;
to the bite but he should be in a lot more pain!
&nbsp;

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:55.840
But then suddenly he s blaming&nbsp;
her for the dog coming in.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:03.280
This is Beating Yourself Up 101! Nobody criticizes&nbsp;
themselves better than themselves. When you have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:10.160
as much baggage as Jessie, it becomes a huge&nbsp;
issue. Jessie is viewing hallucinations of Gerald.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:15.440
So yes Gerald is dead, but this&nbsp;
Gerald who continuously talks to her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:22.880
often in a degrading way is called Inner Gerald
Its almost like a mean therapy session. Using him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:29.920
to beat herself up and also realizes things about&nbsp;
Gerald that she often ignored. Like for example&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:35.840
maybe Gerald only thought women were good for&nbsp;
one thing. That s putting it in a PBS kids way.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:43.200
He also taunts her situation to make her feel&nbsp;
hopeless. Or did he! Suddenly she squeezes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:49.120
her hand out of the cuffs, getting right up to&nbsp;
bread that bed frame off and free her other arm!&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:58.720
Wow that was easy! Not! Jessie just hallucinated&nbsp;
herself breaking free! This is Inner Jessie. Now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:05.040
both Inner hallucinations are arguing with each&nbsp;
other! It becomes more than just escaping from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:12.080
a sex misadventure! Jessie is going to be doing a&nbsp;
lot of confronting today as life is on the line!
&nbsp;

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:19.040
She s got about three days at best! Talking with&nbsp;
Inner Gerald bides the time as they go through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:26.240
the ups and downs of their sex life. Who exactly&nbsp;
did I marry was a question made when she realizes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:32.160
he could only get it up when he chokes her and&nbsp;
stuff like that. Wait, that s not the only way&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:39.760
he got hard! He also used those blue pills! With&nbsp;
a sip of water! She realizes that he left a glass&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:45.840
of water on the shelf above the bed and carefully&nbsp;
gets it off. Sucks that she can t take a drink,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:51.680
so Inner Jessie tells her to put it back&nbsp;
up for now. Wait the dog! Dang that dog is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:55.920
hungry again! It s really biting at Gerald
Then Inner Gerald helps her realizes that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:00.480
she put the tag of her gown on&nbsp;
the bed shelf too. She grabs it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:06.480
hoping to use it as a straw to get a drink. Very&nbsp;
good thinking! Looks like he s good for something!&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:13.200
Jessie leaves some for later, and the inner couple&nbsp;
guide her to sleep for the next day of survival!
&nbsp;

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:19.120
As she sleeps, something is creeping through the&nbsp;
house. Whatever it is, the dog is scared out of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:26.480
the building! Jessie wakes up seeing that dog&nbsp;
is replaced by a tall creepy figure! Who is this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:34.800
scary man with his chest full of bones and booty!&nbsp;
Inner Gerald tells her that maybe he isn t real,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:41.920
maybe he is, but he is the Moonlight Man! The&nbsp;
representation of Jessie s approaching death!&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:46.720
Inner Gerald calls her Mouse at&nbsp;
one point though! Why Mouse?
&nbsp;

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:52.240
She then slips to sleep. See, when&nbsp;
Jessie was just a wee lad, her father&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:58.160
called her Mouse. At one point in her childhood,&nbsp;
her family went on a trip out to a lake house.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:03.840
Instantly we see the father views&nbsp;
Jessie differently than his other kids.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:10.640
The entire family goes out on a boat leaving Dad&nbsp;
and young Jessie together for eclipse viewing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.560
This is already getting awkward. A little&nbsp;
too old to be sitting on her dad s lap&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:22.640
who wants to relieve the old days. 
Bring it on home plays during. Then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:28.880
Jessie s father starts jerking off while she&nbsp;
s sitting on his lap. She wakes up from this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:35.520
abuse nightmare! Jessie has horrid burning&nbsp;
cramps in her arms They need circulation!&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:40.720
Thanks for being so supportive Inner Jessie!&nbsp;
The Inner couple bring us more into the abuse&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:46.080
from her father. They say a lot of people base&nbsp;
their romantic partners on their parents so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:53.840
Gerald probably fits that dynamic, but do you see&nbsp;
that big ass footprint! That s no hallucination!&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:54.480 --> 00:09:01.680
Is it? The Moonlight Man might be back tonight!
Jessie soon gets into another nightmare flashback,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:08.640
right after he masturbated to her. Her father&nbsp;
apologizes and says they should tell mom what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:14.960
happened. That s not what I was expecting the&nbsp;
father to say! Mom will definitely blame her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:22.960
for it since she s not a big fan of her for some&nbsp;
reason. Seems like he kind of manipulated her to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:28.880
come to the choice of not telling anybody but&nbsp;
either way Jessie wakes up from this nightmare&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:33.600
with The Moonlight Man licking her feet!&nbsp;
Turns out in reality it was just the dog!&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:39.840
It bites her feet before she kicks it way!&nbsp;
Tearing off another piece of a nice Gerald cut.
&nbsp;

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:45.520
The dog is going to want fresher meat soon, so&nbsp;
she better do something before that dog smells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:51.040
weakness. This second day of captivity is&nbsp;
almost over! Inner Gerald starts creeping&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:58.160
her out again! Scaring her by saying she ll be&nbsp;
a cold stank corpse with a missing wedding ring&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:04.720
with a bone stolen from her foot by the Moonlight&nbsp;
Man. In another dream, Jessie has a quiet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:12.320
encounter with herself when she was young. Young&nbsp;
Jessie tells her to remember! Don t remember the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:19.760
eclipse or the sun, remember what happened after!
Well after her and the father had that talk,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:26.960
dinner goes weird when Jessie crushes the glass&nbsp;
in her hand. She is wounded but that event gave&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:36.480
her a painful way to get loose from the handcuffs.&nbsp;
It s gonna effing hurt! Jessie and her Inner Self&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:41.280
become a mirror at this point as they both&nbsp;
agree that whatever Jessie is thinking,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:47.040
it could work. Jessie plans on cutting her&nbsp;
wrist horizontally, using the blood to slip&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:52.960
her hand out of the cuffs. She knows that the&nbsp;
wrists have fewer nerves and it ll be slick.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:57.680
She knows a lot about cutting wrists.
Okay so fair warning this next part is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:04.400
going to be pretty harsh for the eyes. Ironically,&nbsp;
this level of metal gore made me flinch more than&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:10.880
Rare: A Dead Person did. Now once she&nbsp;
starts she has to finish it. Jessie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:15.920
grabs that glass and breaks it like years&nbsp;
before, but sticks a shard into the wood.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:22.640
She then uses to to slash her wirst. It hurts&nbsp;
a lot and she s not even feeling that much!&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:29.840
She cuts through the skin, and starts pulling her&nbsp;
hand out of the cuff! The cuff starts degloving&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:37.040
her! Literally pulling her skin off her hand!&nbsp;
Yanking and yanking until finally getting it free!&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:42.080
That actually disturbed me pretty good.&nbsp;
That s the kind of stuff I remember&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:48.480
years later. Finally, free by one hand, she&nbsp;
uses her foot to grab the phone, but its dead!
&nbsp;

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:55.520
She carries the bed over to the counter and uses&nbsp;
the key to get herself free! Clap It up for Jessie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:55.520 --> 00:12:01.680
for making it out! Good work not dying! Right&nbsp;
after wrapping her hand up, she falls out from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:07.680
the pain and blood loss. She wakes up to the dog&nbsp;
biting her, but she shows the dog who s boss!&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:16.560
Gerald just been a dog treat the past two days.&nbsp;
Anyway Jessie unlocks the car and is almost out,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:23.200
but sees the dog freaked out. Turns out it s&nbsp;
the Moonlight Man! Jessie confronts him saying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:28.880
he s only made of Moonlight and gives him&nbsp;
her wedding ring so he leaves him alone!&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:34.960
I don t think he s really made of Moonlight.&nbsp;
Alive and free, Jessie drives off in the car&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:40.160
saying one last goodbye to Inner Gerald.&nbsp;
She proved him wrong a lot tonight. 
&nbsp;

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:46.960
Jessie is crashing hard though, but she has a&nbsp;
mental escapade, eclipse edition! The Moonlight&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:53.680
Man calls her Mouse in her ear, but in reality,&nbsp;
Jessie passed out behind the wheel and crashed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:59.760
into a tree. Luckily, she s still alive and&nbsp;
some people in a near by house rush to her help!&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:08.160
Jessie is finally safe, but The Moonlight Man&nbsp;
is following her home. Just a constant reminder&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:15.600
that all she really did escape was from the&nbsp;
handcuffs. As months pass, Jessie starts writing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:22.800
a letter to her young self Thanking her for&nbsp;
helping older her escape the shackles of silence&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:30.400
and comfort. With the insurance money from&nbsp;
Gerald s death, she starts a foundation for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:36.000
abused children like her, and isn t silent&nbsp;
about what happened in her childhood anymore.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:43.760
Still, the Moonlight Man haunts her every night&nbsp;
That is until someone named Raymond Andrew Jourbet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:51.600
is arrested. Jourbet is a crypt creeper, someone&nbsp;
who vandalized graveyards and stole jewlery from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:58.800
corpses, along with their eyes, noses and ears.
Not to long before he started having sex&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:06.800
with male corpses too and then he transitioned&nbsp;
to the living. Jourbet suffered from acromegaly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:13.520
So you know, he had really large hands and arms, a&nbsp;
forehead almost as big as Berleezy s, that kind of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:19.680
thing. The police found his sister and her husband&nbsp;
scalped and cannibalized, along with a collection&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:25.600
of body parts that would make Ed Gein proud.
So in other words, the Moonlight Man&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:32.560
that Jessie saw while trapped was an actual&nbsp;
serial killer that had snuck in the lake house.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:39.440
Its just a big coincidence that a serial killer&nbsp;
happened upon a woman trapped in handcuffs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:46.000
but Jessie assumed he was fake like almost every&nbsp;
other thing she saw. Well that Moonlight Man has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:55.920
been haunting her for 6 months, and she finally&nbsp;
thinks its time to confront it all through him. 
&nbsp;

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:07.840
Jessie interrupts the trial of Jourbet..who turns&nbsp;
around saying You re not real, you re only made&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:15.360
of moonlight! Mocking Jessie from 6 months ago. He&nbsp;
literally breaks his confines! Despite the entire&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:22.640
court shitting its pants, Jessie confronts all&nbsp;
the pain through him! Her father, Gerald and then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:29.680
the Moonlight Man! You re so much smaller than&nbsp;
I remember she says! The movie ends as Jessie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:35.040
walks out of the court, sliding her sunglasses&nbsp;
on about to go make a few million dollars,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:41.840
no eclipse in sight! This is how I Spit on&nbsp;
Your Grave should have ended! Jessie had that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:49.200
strength all along, and I m happy she created the&nbsp;
opportunities to help herself all throughout this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:54.320
movie! I wanna be like her when I grow up! Now&nbsp;
that we ve gotten through Gerald s Game lets talk&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:59.600
about the most disturbed moment and most enjoyed&nbsp;
moment in that Spooky Stuff! Cue the Gohan!
&nbsp;

00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:09.360
I ve been waiting to watch this movie! FoundFlix&nbsp;
sensei and spookyastronauts sensei s videos&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:14.000
just had me itching to watch! There are some&nbsp;
differences from the book, but the movie is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:21.040
a nice adaption for sure. One of my favorites&nbsp;
to watch! The most disturbed moment is easily&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:27.360
Jessie escaping by degloving her hand! Gah lee,&nbsp;
you d think watching Death Documentaries would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:32.400
make me flinch as much as did scene did! They did&nbsp;
great with this scene, and I m going to remember&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:39.680
it for years! Most enjoyed moment is without a&nbsp;
doubt the ending as Jessie walks in the middle of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:48.800
the effing street scared of nothing! and sunlight&nbsp;
beaming on her. Happy ending, plus you could play&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:48.800 --> 00:17:04.320
a whole Mission Complete sound effect over it. 
And that s it! This Friday I ll be uploading&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:09.600
the next episodes for Another, and the&nbsp;
anime will be finished by next Monday!&nbsp;&nbsp;

Mary, the true second most voted film! Some&nbsp;&nbsp;
