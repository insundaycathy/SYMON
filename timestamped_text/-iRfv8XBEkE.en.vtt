00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.779
Welcome back for another 5 minute movie recap.

00:00:02.779 --> 00:00:07.320
Today, I'm going to give you an overview of
the 2015 American post apocalyptic horror

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.559
drama film called 'Maggie'.

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:14.110
The film is directed by Henry Hobson and stars
Arnold Schwarzenegger, Abigail Breslin and

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:15.889
Joely Richardson.

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:19.860
Maggie is a drastic change for Schwarzenegger,
who is most recognised for his appearances

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:21.370
in action films.

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:25.590
Warning: there will be spoilers ahead, so
please proceed with caution.

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.040
In today's Midwestern United States, civilization
is struggling to operate in the aftermath

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:34.469
of a zombie outbreak that is barely under
control (Necroambulism).

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.680
Maggie Vogel (Abigail Breslin) calls her father
from a broken city under curfew; her voicemail

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.930
begs him not to look for her and expresses
her love for him.

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.309
Her arm had been bitten.

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.780
She fled home to protect her family, knowing
she only had a few weeks until the 'Necroambulist

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.420
virus' turned her cannibalistic.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.140
Despite Maggie's warning, her father Wade
(Arnold Schwarzenegger) had been searching

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.620
for two weeks.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.320
When he finds her in a hospital for the sick,
he brings her home to care for her until she

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.980
must be confined.

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.180
During their return, Wade is attacked by a
zombie in an abandoned gas station, and he

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.610
breaks its neck.

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.220
Bobby and Molly, Maggie's younger half-siblings,
are departing to be with their aunt.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.110
Maggie confides in Bobby, who is mainly aware
of what she is going through.

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.970
She withdraws from her family, unable to cope
with her bleak condition and unsure whether

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:21.860
to contact her friends.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.990
She fractures a finger on her diseased arm
after falling off a swing, and black goo pours

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:27.280
from it.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.810
Maggie chops off her finger, terrified, even
though she feels little or no pain, and despondent

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.620
over her failing body.

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.790
She escapes outdoors and comes upon a neighbour,
Nathan, and his little daughter, both of whom

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:39.110
are infected.

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.930
Wade kills both zombies but is filled with
sorrow.

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.190
The responding sheriff and deputy hold Wade
innocent, blaming Nathan's wife Bonnie for

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.020
concealing her sick family from authorities.

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.520
Bonnie pays Wade a visit that night, protesting
the inhumane treatment of the afflicted and

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.180
disclosing that Nathan had shut himself in
with his young daughter, getting infected

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.310
himself, rather than abandoning her to die
among strangers in quarantine.

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.030
A compassionate doctor lies to Maggie and
on her medical report about the progression

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.289
of her infection, but tells Wade that if he
wants to avoid quarantine, he must euthanize

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.650
Maggie himself, either with an exceedingly
painful medication combination or by 'making

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:14.920
it fast.'

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.430
Wade and Maggie make the best of their last
days by remembering Maggie's late mother.

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.749
Maggie strives to maintain normalcy despite
her physical decline (she is woken by maggots

00:02:23.749 --> 00:02:25.719
writhing in her dying arm).

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:30.469
She attends a campfire with high school pals
Allie and Trent, an infected boy Maggie previously

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:32.180
dated and kisses.

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.349
He spreads stories about the dreadful circumstances
in the quarantine facility, claiming that

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:38.569
he would die before going there.

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:43.209
Maggie smells food near her stepmother Caroline
one day, but Caroline smells nothing and speculates

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.190
that Wade is cooking below.

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:50.019
Caroline discovers, to her dismay, that Maggie
has begun to scent living flesh, in this case

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:51.819
Caroline's, as food.

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:54.020
Trent makes a frantic call to Maggie.

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.889
Trent has shut himself inside his bedroom
at home after smelling another person, his

00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:00.160
father, and feeling hungry.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.060
Maggie attempts to console him but stands
helpless as the cops take Trent to quarantine.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.150
Maggie returns home and discovers a trapped
fox in the woods.

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.849
Later, she comes into her house, frantic and
covered in blood, explaining to her terrified

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:17.050
parents through sobs that she wanted to liberate
the fox but couldn't stop herself from assaulting

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:18.050
it.

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:20.230
Wade dispatches the half-eaten fox.

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.540
Caroline walks away, pleading with Wade to
take Maggie away.

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.189
Wade fights one of the cops before Maggie
enters, telling them that she has not yet

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:28.370
changed.

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.390
The compassionate sheriff departs, reminding
Wade that he must decide what to do with her

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.569
before they return to check on Maggie.

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:39.050
Wade shows Maggie white flowers he grew in
her mother's old yard, 'Daisy' being a nickname

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:41.450
he occasionally uses for Maggie.

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.989
She thanks him for the beauty of the garden,
but she also asks him to swear that he would

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:47.569
'make it stop' before she deteriorates.

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:51.560
Wade afterwards sits alone with his shotgun,
unwilling to fire it.

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:56.110
When Maggie comes, he pretends to sleep, her
skin greying and her eyes darkened.

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:00.200
She hovers over him, sniffing him and kissing
his forehead, as if on the verge of losing

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:01.560
control.

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:02.769
Maggie exits the house.

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:06.959
Wade loads a shell into the shotgun after
noticing one on the floor.

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:10.610
Maggie has gone to the roof and leaps from
it, her final recollections of herself as

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:13.930
a child playing outside with her mother, picking
a flower.
