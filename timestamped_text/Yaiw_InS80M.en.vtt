Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.020
Today I'm going to explain a teen comedy horror
film called The Babysitter.

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:07.460
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:12.230
Watch out and take careCole is a twelve-year-old
boy who is an awkward kid.

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.240
In their school clinic, he refuses to let
the nurse give him a flu shot.

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.050
Cole is afraid of needles, which gives the
school nurse a difficult time.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.230
He gets constantly bullied by his schoolmates
as he is a nerd.

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.480
Melanie is one of the only people who treat
him nicely.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.800
She accompanies Cole in school, and they are
good friends.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.359
Melanie's father arrives to pick her up from
school; she asks her father if they could

00:00:33.359 --> 00:00:37.079
give Cole a ride home, but her father is unwilling
to do so.

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.710
On their block, three kids on their bikes
approach Cole to intimidate and make fun of

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:41.719
him.

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:46.889
When Cole acts uninterested, one of the kids,
Jeremy, pushes him to the ground and calls

00:00:46.889 --> 00:00:49.410
him a weirdo while the others laugh.

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.399
Someone from a distance calls them out.

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:55.899
It is Bee, a beautiful young woman, who defends
him from the three bullies.

00:00:55.899 --> 00:01:00.409
She warns Jeremy not to bother Cole and again
as she pins a hole on Jeremy's tire.

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:02.209
This scares them off, and they flee.

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:06.049
Bee is his babysitter, who is one of his closest
friends.

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:09.369
She checks up on Cole to make sure that he
is not physically hurt.

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:13.229
Bee takes Cole on a drive home and asks about
how his parents are doing.

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.770
He says that Bee only hangs out with him because
she gets paid to do so.

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.179
However, Bee assures him that she has a great
time with Cole regardless; it makes him blush.As

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:26.469
they arrive home, Bee reminds Cole that they
will see each other again tomorrow night because

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:28.869
his parents plan on going on a trip.

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:31.909
He sees Melanie next door, and they wave at
each other.

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:35.670
He looks for his mother and catches her in
the backyard fixing traps for rats and other

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:36.689
bugs.

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.749
Cole tells his mother that people call him
names at school.

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:43.569
She consoles him by saying that things in
life are scary when people are young; she

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:46.569
assures him that things will get much better
when he gets older.

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:50.850
In an empty driving space, Cole's father lets
him drive to give him lessons.

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.460
Cole cowardly admits that he is not yet ready
and is too scared to accelerate the car.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.130
His father understands and takes over.

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.049
Cole seems to have a good relationship with
his parents.

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.780
His mother and father are both laid-back and
are unlike other parents.

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.869
He enters their room to have a conversation
with them, but they are both busy.

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.930
His father is binge-watching Mad Men, while
his mother has paperwork.

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.959
That night, he goes to his room to open his
laptop and watch Mad Men.

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.510
This is in hopes that he could connect with
his father on a deeper level.

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.459
Cole does not sleep and watches the show
until morning.

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:28.760
On the bus to school, Cole tells Melanie that
he feels like his parents do not like him,

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.420
and they take every chance they get to avoid
being with him, thus, the frequent trips without

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:34.420
him.

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.819
Melanie tells Cole that she thinks Bee brings
boys over whenever Cole falls asleep.

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:41.769
He gets curious and tells Melanie that he
will stay up all night to test their theory.

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:44.610
That afternoon, Cole spies on Bee.

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.270
He sees her by a mini-mart with another guy.

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.640
They flirt with each other and seem happy.

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.410
This sparks jealousy in Cole, and he just
stares at them until someone hits him with

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:58.689
a soccer ball.Later that day, Cole's parents
rush as they get ready to leave.

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:02.410
They remind Cole of the things that he can
and can't do while they are away.

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.860
The doorbell rings and his mother asks him
to get it as it is probably Bee. Cole fixes

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.790
his shirt before making his way to the front
door to welcome his babysitter.

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.409
They both greet each other with their own
handshake.

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:16.980
Cole's parents continue to head outside and
go about their getaway.

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.500
Bee and Cole have a night of dancing; they
set up lights as if the house is a nightclub.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.970
They also swim in the pool and basically have
a good time together.

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.180
While making dinner, Bee and Cole talk about
spaceships.

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.819
These are the rare moments when Cole feels
like someone is listening and can relate to

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:33.799
the stuff he is interested in.

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:37.870
They continue to joke about each other, and
after, they decide to have a movie night in

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:38.900
the yard.

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.159
A projector flashes the movie on a wider screen,
and both of them take turns reenacting the

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:44.170
movie.

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:46.819
They go inside the house and crash on the
couch.

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:50.750
Bee teases Cole on liking Melanie, but he
is in complete denial.

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.989
It's time for bed, but Cole says that he is
not tired.

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:57.790
Bee decides to let him take a shot, so he
could fall asleep faster.

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.440
He asks her to take a shot with him; she agrees
and heads back to the kitchen for her shot.

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.720
While Bee is out of sight, Cole pours the
shot on a vase.

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.750
As Bee returns, he coughs and pretends that
he already drank it.Cole is now in his room,

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.380
pretending that he is already tired and going
to bed.

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.830
He calls Melanie and discusses their plan
to spy on what Bee will do while he sleeps.

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:20.670
Bee enters the room to ask if Cole needs anything.

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:24.470
He thanks her for being so nice to him and
treating him like he is "normal."

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.640
They continue to have a short but significant
conversation about how it is acceptable to

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:29.780
be weird.

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.620
They both say good night, so Bee leaves the
room.

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.570
Half an hour later, the doorbell rings.

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:39.380
Melanie encourages him to go see what Bee
gets up to after he goes to sleep.

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.890
He quietly sneaks out of the room and crawls
toward the staircase to see what is going

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:43.900
on.

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:49.750
He sees Bee and several of her high school
friends: Max, Allison, John, Sonya, and Samuel.

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:53.140
Among the group, Samuel seems to be the odd
one out.

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:56.790
He just got invited by Bee when they were
together at the mini-mart.

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:01.170
They are all playing a game oftruth or dareformatted
as a game ofspin the bottle.

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:06.000
The bottle points at Bee during that round.Max
dares her to kiss everyone in the room.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.910
First, she gives Max a quick kiss on the lips.

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:13.450
Next, she and Allison have a steamy session
that takes everyone by surprise.

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:16.870
Entertained by this, Cole continues to watch
from upstairs.

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:20.210
John does not receive a kiss from Bee, and
they all laugh.

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:23.730
She kisses Sonya on the forehead, then proceeds
to Samuel.

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:27.190
He refuses to kiss Bee because he does not
want anyone looking.

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:29.630
He is overwhelmed by the people he just met.

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:31.540
Bee finally kisses him.

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:35.810
After a few moments, she brutally shoves two
knives into his skullâ€”Samuel shrieks in

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:37.190
pain and fear.

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:40.580
Bee tells him that he is helping them fulfill
a greater purpose.

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:43.930
From upstairs, Cole's face fills with utter
disbelief.

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:46.260
He could not process what he is seeing.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:50.410
Bee removes the knives from Samuel's head
as he gradually loses a life.

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:52.440
They fill the chalice with his blood.

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:56.600
John taps Samuel's head as the blood from
the left side is not seeping through.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:00.240
However, it bursts, and he is now covered
in blood.

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:04.120
Cole hears Bee say, "things get messy, when
you make a deal with the devil."

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:09.050
The chalice is now full of blood, so they
lay Samuel in the corner of the room.The group

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:11.470
opens a big box to retrieve a book.

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:15.960
The book is ancient and delicate, which contains
verses that they will use for the ritual.

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:19.390
Bee says that they should start as soon as
possible so they could head upstairs and get

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:20.990
the blood of the innocent.

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:26.570
Upon hearing it, Cole gasps, realizing that
he will also be used as a human sacrifice.

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:29.540
He hyperventilates and tries to call 9 1 1.

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:33.770
He reaches the police and informs them that
a lifeless guy is in his living room.

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:36.190
He finds a pocket knife in his room as a weapon
of self-defense.

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:41.720
However, he hears the group approach his room,
so he pretends to be asleep.

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:45.440
Cole hears that Sonya will use a syringe to
extract blood from him.

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:48.940
He panics but is unable to move as he has
no choice but to be still.

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:53.030
They hold his arm and insert the needle, but
they miss the vein on the first try.

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:55.580
They make the second attempt and are successful.

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:59.090
Bee tucks him in bed but notices the open
window in his room.

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:03.230
As soon as they exit, Cole gets up to make
a makeshift rope out of his blankets.

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:06.740
He rushes to combine the sheets before they
return to his room.

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:10.150
Ready to climb out the window, Bee finds out
that he is wide awake.

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:15.170
However, he falls unconscious after losing
some blood.Cole wakes up in their living room

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:16.820
and is tied to a chair.

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:19.410
Bee and her friends gather in front of him.

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:21.800
Sonya feeds him a cookie under Bee's command.

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:25.550
Her cult question Cole while fending offhis
questions by saying they needed his blood

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:27.340
for a science project.

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:31.140
She says that it is helpful to maintain his
sugar levels after fainting.

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:33.600
They interrogate him, asking about the window
and

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:34.790
the sheets.

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:38.340
Cole says that he was just trying to sneak
out so he could smoke outside.

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:40.250
But the group is unconvinced.

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:44.590
While they converse, Cole tries to cut the
rope using the pocket knife from earlier.

00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:48.560
Unfortunately, a mirror is behind him, and
the group can see his reflection trying to

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:49.620
escape.

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:53.080
They make fun of him and joke around about
his determination to go.

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:56.690
Bee decides to let him go and instructs Sonya
to untie him.

00:07:56.690 --> 00:08:00.710
Before going near Cole, police vehicles arrive
and put the group in a panic.

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:04.440
Bee becomes agitated and asks Cole if he was
the one who called the cops and if he saw

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:06.150
the Samuel incident.

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:09.310
He calls out for help, so Max kicks him to
shut him up.

00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:13.290
Two police officers kick the door open and
order everyone to freeze.

00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:16.920
Max throws a sharp object at one of the officers
and hits his eye.

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:20.840
The injured officer accidentally pulls the
trigger; the bullet hits Allison, and she

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:22.680
is thrown across the room.

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:25.590
Her left chest becomes bloody because of the
wound.

00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:30.080
As John begs the other officer not to shoot
him, Bee comes from behind and slits the officer's

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:31.080
neck.

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:33.860
To say that the house is in chaos is an understatement.

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:38.729
Unsatisfied, Max approaches the officer he
attacked and brutally finished him off.The

00:08:38.729 --> 00:08:42.740
other officers from the station contact the
now dead cops through the radio.

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:45.980
The group struggles with coming up with what
to say because they are not familiar with

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:47.279
cop codes.

00:08:47.279 --> 00:08:51.790
They ask Cole; he gives 10-53, but Bee thinks
that it is a trap.

00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:54.279
She asks him again and says 10-4.

00:08:54.279 --> 00:08:58.600
They get a sigh of relief as the officers
on the radio say, all clear.

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:02.290
Allison suffers because of the bullet wounds
at the corner, but the group refuses to call

00:09:02.290 --> 00:09:05.540
an ambulance as it will put them in a critical
position.

00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:09.899
While the rest of them deal with Allison,
Cole finds the perfect opportunity to run.

00:09:09.899 --> 00:09:12.620
He rushes upstairs while John chases him.

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:17.199
Cole pushes him; John slips because of a toy
car and falls from the second floor.

00:09:17.199 --> 00:09:21.230
The staircase handle hits his head, and a
sharp trophy gets through his neck.

00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:25.190
Now that one of them is dead, the group gets
more agitated toward Cole.

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:27.720
He runs to his room and climbs out the window.

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:32.000
Unfortunately, Max gets to him and pulls the
sheets to get a hold of him.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.100
Without a choice, Cole lets go and falls to
the ground.

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:39.649
He manages to run to the garage and hide under
a car while Max is hunting him down.

00:09:39.649 --> 00:09:43.220
In the crowded space, he sees Samuel's lifeless
body.

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:46.400
Cole panics, but he cannot let his fear get
ahead of him.

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:48.779
He looks for valuable tools that can protect
himself.

00:09:48.779 --> 00:09:53.690
In an old toolbox, he finds a firework rocket
and comes up with a plan.

00:09:53.690 --> 00:09:57.519
He reenters the house through the crawlspace
where his mother keeps multiple traps for

00:09:57.519 --> 00:09:58.769
pests.

00:09:58.769 --> 00:10:01.129
Sonya suspects that Cole is inside.

00:10:01.129 --> 00:10:02.800
She opens it and enters.

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:07.860
He remains still under a thin blanket and
holds his breath strictly to prevent any noise.

00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:10.529
Sonya points the flashlight in Cole's direction.

00:10:10.529 --> 00:10:13.110
She touches a spider that is right above him.

00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:18.069
At this point, Cole is terrified, but Sonya
decides to leave as she finds nothing.

00:10:18.069 --> 00:10:20.080
She crawls back to the way out.

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:24.399
Cole flicks the spider away, and the trap
catches it, causing a noise.

00:10:24.399 --> 00:10:27.290
Sonya notices it and makes her way back to
the young boy.

00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:29.980
He points the firework at her but misses.

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:33.920
Sonya's hands are caught by the mousetraps,
which bids time for Cole to get out.

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:37.959
He traps her in the basement and ignites a
firework rocket with bug spray, burning her

00:10:37.959 --> 00:10:39.089
to death.

00:10:39.089 --> 00:10:44.350
The explosion throws Cole across the garden.Max
chases Cole outside the house.

00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:48.610
Cole manages to trip him and kick his private
part, causing him extreme pain.

00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:50.949
Max gets up and strangles the boy.

00:10:50.949 --> 00:10:53.939
Gasping for air, both of them notice a sound.

00:10:53.939 --> 00:10:58.459
Cole tells Max that Jeremy, who is his bully,
is throwing eggs at his house.

00:10:58.459 --> 00:11:01.350
Jeremy dances as he enjoys making fun of Cole.

00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:05.880
After showing appreciation for Cole's ingenuity
and urging him to start standing up for himself,

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:08.180
Max pushes him to confront Jeremy.

00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:10.519
Cole threatens Jeremy that he will kick him.

00:11:10.519 --> 00:11:13.329
He awkwardly throws a kick but fails miserably.

00:11:13.329 --> 00:11:16.180
In return, Jeremy punches him to the ground.

00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:19.630
Cole explains that a group of teenagers is
trying to kill him and that cops have died

00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:20.830
inside his house.

00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:24.870
Although his desperate remarks, Jeremy just
cracks an egg into his head.

00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:27.529
Max helps him up, but Cole punches him.

00:11:27.529 --> 00:11:29.819
Max chases Cole up a treehouse.

00:11:29.819 --> 00:11:34.680
When he is about to strangle him to death,
the treehouse is too old, causing it to collapse.

00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:37.939
Max is killed when he falls and is hanged
by the rope swing.

00:11:37.939 --> 00:11:40.900
Cole looks at his body in shock and hears
a gunshot.

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:44.990
Cole escapes to Melanie's house and explains
to her the situation; she informs him that

00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:48.160
her dad is not around and they are now alone
in the house.

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:50.829
Bee follows him and opens the doors with ease.

00:11:50.829 --> 00:11:53.569
She observes the house while looking for signs
of them.

00:11:53.569 --> 00:11:57.819
Both of them manage to stay quiet and wait
for a clear signal to move elsewhere.

00:11:57.819 --> 00:12:02.019
While hiding in a room, Cole apologizes to
Melanie for dragging her into this situation

00:12:02.019 --> 00:12:04.749
and assures her that he will take care of
things.

00:12:04.749 --> 00:12:09.180
He asks Melanie to call the police; then,
she kisses Cole before he leaves.

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:14.069
They both smile for a split second despite
the situation that they are in.Cole returns

00:12:14.069 --> 00:12:17.240
to his house, but it is completely dark and
empty.

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:22.370
He tries to stay silent while walking around
the house.

00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:24.209
He finds Allison pretending to be dead; he
makes sure that she is not breathing by looking

00:12:24.209 --> 00:12:26.959
at her intently and checking if she still
breathes.

00:12:26.959 --> 00:12:30.230
He makes his way to the kitchen and finds
the gigantic book.

00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:34.630
Suddenly, Allison attacks him from behind,
but he punches her bullet wound, so she gets

00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:35.730
off him.

00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:38.519
She continues to go after him using a knife.

00:12:38.519 --> 00:12:42.149
Before she can stab him, Bee kills her with
a cop's shotgun.

00:12:42.149 --> 00:12:44.589
Allison's blood is now all over Cole's face.

00:12:44.589 --> 00:12:48.329
He threatens Bee that he will burn the book,
which is very important to her.

00:12:48.329 --> 00:12:51.180
Bee nervously approaches him out of concern
of the book.

00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:55.209
Bee confesses to Cole that she was once insecure
and meek like him until she made a deal with

00:12:55.209 --> 00:12:59.540
theDevilto get whatever she wanted by sacrificing
innocent people and spilling their pure blood

00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:02.029
on an ancient book while reciting its verses.

00:13:02.029 --> 00:13:06.180
Since then, Bee has been traveling from different
places to prey on young

00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:07.529
boys like him.

00:13:07.529 --> 00:13:11.290
Although she offers to let him join her cult
and tell the cops that they are innocent,

00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:14.040
Cole refuses and burns the spellbook anyway.

00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:16.779
This time Bee's charms do not work on him
anymore.

00:13:16.779 --> 00:13:20.670
He runs to Melanie's house to take her dad's
car; he drives it recklessly into his house

00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:23.199
while Bee is distracted by the burning book.

00:13:23.199 --> 00:13:25.699
The vehicle crashes directly into her.

00:13:25.699 --> 00:13:27.230
Cole climbs out of the wrecked car.

00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:31.540
They have one last emotional farewell as they
reminisce about their friendship.

00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:35.410
Bee initiates to do their handshake, but Cole
leaves her to die alone.

00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:39.949
The police officers and firefighters arrive
at the house for rescue operations.

00:13:39.949 --> 00:13:42.190
His parents come and rush to embrace him.

00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:48.160
He tells his parents that he no longer needs
a babysitter anymore.

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:57.019
Moments after, Bee attacks a firefighter going
through 

00:13:57.019 --> 00:13:58.999
the house.
