00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:03.190
Hi, Mystery Recapped here.

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:08.920
Today, I am going to explain the ninth episode
of the South Korean survival drama “Squid

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.600
Game” called “One lucky day” Spoilers
ahead!

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:17.310
Watch out and take care!

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.320
After Saebyeok’s death, Sangwoo and Gi-hun
are taken for the sixth and the final game.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.800
As they stand before each other, the staff
reveals that in the last game, they will either

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.690
have to be on the offense or defense.

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:36.429
Gi-hun wins the toss and chooses offense.

00:00:36.429 --> 00:00:40.930
The two are then let into a field where they
played the very first game, red light green

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:41.930
light.

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.990
In the middle of the field, a geometrical
figure of a squid is drawn.

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:49.129
The VIPs observe the game from a higher platform.

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:53.059
The overseer explains to them that the last
game is called the “squid game.”

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:56.620
It was a children’s game that was played
in Korea many years ago.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.659
The attacker, Gi-hun, has to be inside the
squid’s drawing.

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:05.930
To win the game, he has to run past the defense,
Sangwoo, and tap the squid’s face with his

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:06.930
foot.

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.820
If Sangwoo manages to push Gi-hun out of the
squid drawing, he wins the game.

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.800
And lastly, if one of them cannot continue
the game for any reason, the last one standing

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.010
will win.

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.360
When they are inside the squid’s body, Gi-hun
asks the staff in what scenario they will

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.650
not be able to continue the game.

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:27.940
The staff replies that the last scenario is
if a player dies, hinting that killing each

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.520
other is absolutely fair in the game.

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.900
The overseer tells the VIPs that any kind
of violence is allowed in the squid game,

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.670
and there are no restrictions.

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.910
Gi-hun takes his position and ties his shoelace,
ready to fight his old friend, while Sangwoo

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.220
takes his position with a knife.

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.790
The game finally starts, and Gi-hun asks Sangwoo
if he remembers how they used to play this

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.340
game when they were young.

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.910
As Sangwoo tries to attack him, he throws
dirt into his eyes and easily makes his way

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:57.260
to the squid’s neck.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.890
Just then, the sky goes dark, and it starts
to rain.

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.510
Sangwoo knows that Gi-hun is upset because
he killed Saebyeok.

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:09.030
He makes an excuse saying that she was going
to die anyway; he just saved her from a lot

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.030
of pain.

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.109
However, Gi-hun doesn’t buy his bullshit
and calls him out for killing her because

00:02:14.109 --> 00:02:15.540
of his greed.

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.439
Sangwoo finally comes clean and says that
he killed her because Gi-hun would have stopped

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:21.379
the whole game to save her.

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:25.129
And since the majority would vote to stop
it, he would have to go back home with no

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:26.129
money.

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:29.660
Gi-hun takes his knife out and tells him how
Saebyeok stopped him from killing Sangwoo

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:30.700
last night.

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.549
He then says that he won’t let Sangwoo take
the money at any cost and attacks him.

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:38.270
The two struggle, trying to kill each other
with their knives.

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.599
But they soon lose their weapons and combat
with their hands under the rain.

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:46.780
A while later, both are muddy and tired, but
they don’t stop fighting.

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.409
Sangwoo gets his hand on a knife and stabs
Gi-hun on his thigh.

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:54.889
Gi-hun lies limp on the ground while Sangwoo
asks him if he remembers this playground from

00:02:54.889 --> 00:02:56.079
the first game.

00:02:56.079 --> 00:03:00.819
He attacks Gi-hun with the knife with an intention
to end him, but it only stabs his palm.

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:04.000
Gi-hun bites his legs and turns the match
around.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.639
Both are bloodied when Gi-hun sits on top
of Sangwoo and attacks him with the knife.

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:12.349
But instead of killing him, he stabs the ground
beside his head.

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:15.969
Even after all Sangwoo has done, Gi-hun doesn’t
kill him.

00:03:15.969 --> 00:03:19.770
He simply stands up and makes his way to the
squid’s face.

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:24.680
The VIPs declare Gi-hun the winner, and the
staff points his gun at Sangwoo on the ground.

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.999
However, before Gi-hun can reach the head,
he turns back and stops the man from shooting

00:03:29.999 --> 00:03:30.999
Sangwoo.

00:03:30.999 --> 00:03:34.499
He asks him if they both agree to terminate
the game, will they get out alive.

00:03:34.499 --> 00:03:37.900
The staff calls the overseer and asks if that
is possible.

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.730
The VIPs are shocked to see Gi-hun willing
to sacrifice all that money and hard work

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.749
for his unfaithful friend.

00:03:44.749 --> 00:03:49.709
A heavily injured Sangwoo asks Gi-hun if he
remembers his mother cooking them supper when

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:52.120
they were little after they played every day.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.829
Gi-hun extends his hand to his friend and
asks him to come home.

00:03:55.829 --> 00:04:01.739
But Sangwoo apologizes to him, takes the knife
from the ground, and stabs himself in the

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:02.739
neck.

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:06.579
Gi-hun freezes in shock as his friend takes
his last breath.

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:10.489
Sangwoo tries saying something about his mother
but dies before he can.

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:14.969
A heartbroken Gi-hun cries while holding his
dead friend in his hands.

00:04:14.969 --> 00:04:20.889
Gi-hun has finally won the game along with
four hundred fifty-six billion won.

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:24.400
In the following scene, Gi-hun is in a limo
with the overseer.

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.710
He has his hands tied and his eyes blindfolded
so he cannot see the man.

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:33.920
The overseer congratulates him for winning
the game, but Gi-hun asks him who he is.

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:38.300
Instead of answering, the overseer activates
the gas valves in the limo, making Gi-hun

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:39.620
unconscious again.

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:44.009
After a while, the limo stops by the side
of a busy road, and someone throws Gi-hun

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:45.009
outside.

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:47.840
Just then, a man helps Gi-hun by removing
his blindfold.

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.759
Gi-hun realizes he has something inside his
mouth and spits out a credit card.

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:55.490
He goes straight to the ATM and enters the
card.

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:59.800
Without thinking much about the pin, he enters
his player number, 0456.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:05.289
Gi-hun then withdraws a single ten thousand
won bill and sees he still has four hundred

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:07.810
fifty-six billion won in his bank account.

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:11.260
However, Gi-hun doesn’t seem happy about
the revelation.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.580
In fact, he doesn’t react at all.

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:17.990
To him, the death of four hundred fifty-five
people isn’t worth the money in his bank

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:19.250
account right now.

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:21.460
He takes the bill and returns back to his
house.

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:25.590
On his way, Sangwoo’s mother stops him and
asks him about his injuries.

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:30.400
The old woman asks him if he has heard from
Sangwoo while Gi-hun just stands there holding

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.610
his tears, having witnessed sangwoo’s death
a few hours ago.

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:41.599
He then returns back home to see his mother
lying limp on the floor.

00:05:41.599 --> 00:05:44.319
He asks her to wake up but unfortunately,
she doesn’t.

00:05:44.319 --> 00:05:47.280
Gi-hun’s mother had died while he was away.

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:50.020
He cries in pain and lays down beside her.

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:54.250
The only reason Gi-hun joined the game again
was to pay for his mother’s treatment, but

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:56.000
even she is gone.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.849
The scene then cuts to a year later.

00:05:57.849 --> 00:06:00.659
Gi-hun is on a train traveling somewhere.

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:05.400
He looks to be in bad shape, as his hair has
grown out and his beard is untrimmed.

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:10.000
He has a grim look on his face like he had
a year ago after returning from the game,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.720
indicating that nothing much has changed since
then.

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:15.850
It turns out that he is going to the bank
where his money was transferred after the

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:16.850
game.

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:20.300
The bank manager sweet talks to him because
of teh amount of money in his bank account.

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:25.050
He wants Gi-hun to transfer his money to another
account so that he would get more interest.

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:30.000
As he talks, Gi-hun replies with vague answers
and looks uninterested.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.490
After a while, Gi-hun gets up and surprises
the manager by asking to borrow ten thousand

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:35.770
won from him.

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:38.970
The manager is left speechless but gives him
the money anyway.

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:43.539
With that money, Gi-hun goes to a beach and
sits by himself while drinking.

00:06:43.539 --> 00:06:47.620
A woman selling roses insists he buy one,
so he does.

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:50.289
With the rose, she also gives him a tiny envelope.

00:06:50.289 --> 00:06:55.560
Gi-hun opens the envelope and is surprised
to see a golden card with the symbol of the

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:56.560
game card.

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:59.259
On the back of the card, an address and time
are written.

00:06:59.259 --> 00:07:03.740
Gi-hun is beyond surprised but is determined
to find answers as to why the game was being

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:06.060
played and who was behind everything.

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:10.419
He goes to the address written on the card
and ends up in a room with an old man lying

00:07:10.419 --> 00:07:12.080
on a hospital bed.

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:15.610
When he goes near the man, Gi-hun freezes
in shock.

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:17.260
The man is player number one, Oh Ilnam.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:18.919
Gi-hun cannot believe his eyes and just stares
at him in shock.

00:07:18.919 --> 00:07:22.599
Ilnam asks him for a glass of water, and he
quietly gives it to him.

00:07:22.599 --> 00:07:27.960
Gi-hun composes himself and asks Ilnam who
he actually is and if he was the mastermind

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:29.069
behind the games.

00:07:29.069 --> 00:07:33.870
Ilnam ignores his questions and points out
a drunk and passed-out man on the street through

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:35.000
the window.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.939
He asks Gi-hun if he still trusts people after
what he has been through.

00:07:38.939 --> 00:07:43.539
Gi-hun, in turn, gets more irritated by the
second and asks him the same question again.

00:07:43.539 --> 00:07:46.199
Ilnam then tells him he wants to play a game.

00:07:46.199 --> 00:07:51.139
If someone helps the drunk man before midnight,
Gi-hun will win, and Ilnam will answer all

00:07:51.139 --> 00:07:55.560
his questions, but if no one helps the drunk
man, Ilnam will be the winner.

00:07:55.560 --> 00:08:00.419
Gi-hun loses his cool and strangles Ilnam,
but he stops when the old man claims he wouldn’t

00:08:00.419 --> 00:08:02.990
get answers to his questions if he kills him.

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:06.229
Gi-hun quietly obliges and looks at the watch.

00:08:06.229 --> 00:08:08.590
Twenty minutes are left till midnight.

00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:11.630
They wait for someone to help the man in silence.

00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:15.159
After a while, Gi-hun again asks the old man
who is he.

00:08:15.159 --> 00:08:19.250
Ilnam comes clean by saying that he is the
mastermind of the game.

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:23.650
He and some of his extremely rich friends
were bored, even though they had a lot of

00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:25.969
money that had no happiness in life.

00:08:25.969 --> 00:08:30.449
So, they all came up with this plan to somehow
make their life interesting.

00:08:30.449 --> 00:08:34.269
He wanted to meet Gi-hun because he hasn’t
used any of his prize money and is still living

00:08:34.269 --> 00:08:35.570
his old life.

00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:39.220
Ilnam asks if Gi-hun hasn’t used the money
because he feels guilty.

00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:43.680
Gi-hun claps back by saying that Ilnam should
be the one with guilt for killing so many

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:44.680
people.

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:49.240
But Ilnam claims that the players came to
the game at their will, and he didn’t force

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:50.240
anyone.

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:54.519
Gi-hun then inquires why he joined the game
himself when he could have just watched them.

00:08:54.519 --> 00:08:58.610
Ilnam claims that he missed his childhood
days and wanted to live them one more time

00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:00.360
before dying of a brain tumor.

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:05.730
As they talk, a girl approaches the drunk
man in the streets but walks away right after.

00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:09.600
Ilnam continues saying he doesn’t regret
joining the game because he was the happiest

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:13.160
he had been in a long time while he was playing
with them.

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:17.310
As he says his last words, only a few seconds
are left till midnight.

00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:20.620
A police car stops in front of the drunk man.

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:25.130
The girl who had approached him earlier had
gone to ask for help from the police.

00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:28.750
Seconds before midnight, the man is saved,
and Gi-hun wins the bet.

00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:33.820
But it is too late because Ilnam takes his
last breath and dies before revealing any

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:35.320
more things about the game.

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:39.070
Gi-hun looks at the old man’s face for the
last time and leaves.

00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:42.889
Then, we see the flashback of the time they
were playing the fifth game.

00:09:42.889 --> 00:09:47.589
The main man of the game takes off his mask
and reveals himself to be Oh Ilnam.

00:09:47.589 --> 00:09:52.480
Back in the present, the overseer of the game,
Inho, closes Ilnam’s eyes.

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:55.390
In the following scene, we see Gi-hun at a
barber’s shop.

00:09:55.390 --> 00:10:00.010
He has finally gotten closure from the mastermind
of the game himself, so he feels better for

00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:01.660
the first time in a year.

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:07.000
He walks out of the shop with bright red hair,
indicating a new and fresh start.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.790
Gi-hun then goes to the orphanage where Saebyeok’s
brother lives.

00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:15.400
He greets the little boy, who starts talking
once Gi-hun mentions Saebyeok.

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:18.690
Gi-hun is there to fulfill the promise he
had made to Saebyeok.

00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:22.470
He takes the little boy to Sangwoo’s mother
and asks her to take care of him.

00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:25.800
The old woman happily welcomes the little
boy and treats him with love.

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:29.080
Gi-hun then gives her luggage and leaves.

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:34.350
After he is gone, she opens the luggage looking
for a jacket for the little boy but finds

00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:35.850
it full of money instead.

00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:39.540
Surprised, she calls Gi-hun’s name, but
he is already gone.

00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:43.560
Gi-hun then makes his way to the subway while
on a call with his daughter.

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:46.579
He is going to the US to meet her after a
year.

00:10:46.579 --> 00:10:51.410
At the station, he is beyond surprised to
see the game’s salesman who handed him the

00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:54.250
card and got him into all the chaos.

00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:58.350
The man is playing the same game with someone
else and smiles when he sees Gi-hun.

00:10:58.350 --> 00:11:04.070
Gi-hun runs towards him, but before he can
catch him, the man gets into a train and leaves.

00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:08.250
Gi-hun takes the card from another man who
he was playing with and warns him not to go

00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:10.019
there at any cost.

00:11:10.019 --> 00:11:14.329
He then makes his way to the airport but calls
the number from the card one last time.

00:11:14.329 --> 00:11:18.940
The person from the other end asks him for
his name, date of birth and if he wants to

00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:19.940
play the game.

00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:23.970
Gi-hun tells him his name, surprising the
man on the other end.

00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:26.860
He then tells him that he isn’t a horse
that they could bet on.

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:30.610
The man recognizes him and calls him number
456.

00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:35.040
He tells Gi-hun to get on the flight and continue
with his life for his own good.

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:38.980
Gi-hun tells the man that he will never forgive
the people who made them play the game.

00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:45.540
He cuts the call and turns back around, determined
to bring the game to an end.

00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:49.940
