00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:07.200
Hi, Mystery Recapped here. Today I’m going to&nbsp;
explain an American science fiction disaster film&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:16.160
called “The Core,” Spoilers ahead!&nbsp;
Watch out and take care! 
&nbsp;

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.760
The movie begins in Boston, Massachusetts.&nbsp;
Three enthusiastic businesspersons get ready&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:27.840
to go into a meeting. As soon as they walk in,&nbsp;
one person falls unconscious. Simultaneously,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.440
many people pass out dead throughout the city,&nbsp;
and several accidents take place at the same time.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:39.600
Meanwhile, at the University of Chicago, Dr.&nbsp;
Joshua “Josh” Keyes is teaching students about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.680
sound waves. His lecture is interrupted by two men&nbsp;
in black suits who insist he come with them. Josh&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.440
is confused but agrees anyway. They get him on&nbsp;
a jet and bring him to a facility in Washington&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:57.360
where Josh meets his old friend Dr. Serge Leveque.&nbsp;
Serge is a nuclear weapon specialist and was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.560
urgently called to the facility. They are taken to&nbsp;
a morgue-like place with many dead bodies and are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:07.280
greeted by Lieutenant General Thomas Purcell. 
The Lieutenant informs them that all the dead&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.720
bodies have the same date and time of death. By&nbsp;
the clue, Josh instantly guesses that all of them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.920
had pacemakers inserted in their hearts. The duo&nbsp;
is here to help them figure out what caused the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:23.200
pacemakers to stop working. The Lieutenant assumes&nbsp;
that it is a result of an electromagnetic pulse&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.880
weapon, but Josh assures him that it cannot be&nbsp;
possible. Meanwhile, in Trafalgar Square, London,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.440
many birds start falling dead on the ground&nbsp;
while others randomly launch at the people and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:39.520
buildings. Sometime later, Josh and his co-worker&nbsp;
friends watch the news about the event on TV. Josh&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.840
finally realizes that the deaths of the people&nbsp;
and the bird attacks might be related to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:49.360
Earth’s magnetic field. He asks his co-worker&nbsp;
to get hold of any other similar bizarre events&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.240
happening in the world. Josh then gets on his&nbsp;
computer, wishing that his theory is wrong. 
&nbsp;

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:01.120
Somewhere else, in outer space, Major Rebecca&nbsp;
“Beck” Childs and Commander Bob Iverson are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.680
ready to land the Space Shuttle Endeavor back&nbsp;
on Earth. When they enter the atmosphere,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.080
a magnetic instability causes them to&nbsp;
lose connection with the mission control.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.600
Then, they notice the shuttle’s line of launch is&nbsp;
wrong, and it is about to crash land. Beck quickly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.800
makes some calculations and changes the course.&nbsp;
Following her calculations, they land into the LA&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:27.680
river, avoiding any property or life damage. 
Meanwhile, an Earth specialist named Dr. Conrad&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.040
Zimsky is approached by Josh. He presents his&nbsp;
ideas to Zimsky who condescendingly asks him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.560
to meet at his office. Later, Josh explains about&nbsp;
the magnetic field to him but an arrogant Zimsky&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.200
claims it to be false. Although Zimsky acted&nbsp;
like he didn’t care, after Josh leaves,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.080
he brings out a secret file and calls Lieutenant&nbsp;
Thomas to tell him about the discovery. 
&nbsp;

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.560
Meanwhile, Josh and Serge are at a bar talking&nbsp;
when they are interrupted by the guards&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.040
again. They take the duo to a conference where&nbsp;
high-ranking officials concerned with the matter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:02.240
are called. Zimsky presents the discovery as his&nbsp;
own and asks Josh to explain it to the panel.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:06.640
Josh uses a half-cut peach to represent the&nbsp;
earth and explains that the earth’s inner core&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.600
has stopped spinning because of an unknown reason.&nbsp;
This means that the electromagnetic field around&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:17.120
the earth will soon disappear which will further&nbsp;
expose the earth’s surface to unfiltered solar&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.480
radiation. Josh uses fire and a peach to show&nbsp;
what will happen to the earth in a few months. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:28.080
Lieutenant asks for a solution and Josh replies&nbsp;
that there isn’t one. However, Zimsky is adamant&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:33.360
about finding a way to restart the planet. 
The group immediately flies to Utah to meet Dr.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.480
Edward "Braz" Brazzelton. Braz shows them his&nbsp;
invention called the ultrasonic lasers which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.120
can create holes in any dense rock. Using this&nbsp;
technology, they can create a hole through the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.920
ground that will lead them to the earth’s core.&nbsp;
Lieutenant Thomas offers Braz all resources he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.080
needs to create a ship that will take them&nbsp;
to the core. They plan to set off nuclear&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:56.880
charges into the earth's core to induce force&nbsp;
that will rotate it again. While inducing the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.960
charges is not that difficult, traveling to&nbsp;
the core is the team’s biggest problem. 
&nbsp;

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:06.720
Somewhere else, FBI agents meet a hacker&nbsp;
named Donald "Rat" Finch. They take the man&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.280
to the Lieutenant and the team. Bat has been&nbsp;
recruited to control the flow of information&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:16.000
on the Internet and prevent any information&nbsp;
about the mission from being circulated. 
&nbsp;

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.800
Meanwhile, Beck and Bob, who managed to land&nbsp;
the shuttle safely earlier, are praised for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:25.120
their quick thinking. The lieutenant walks&nbsp;
in and assigns the two to accompany Josh,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:31.360
Serge, Zimsky, and Braz on the mission. Some days&nbsp;
later, a conference is organized to declare the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:36.400
official initiation of the mission. Beck meets&nbsp;
Josh and her team members for the first time.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:41.280
Josh is declared the head of the mission,&nbsp;
to Zimsky’s dismay. He starts narrating the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:46.240
preparation period that will go on for the&nbsp;
next three months. First, Braz and his team&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:51.040
of experienced scientists will manufacture the&nbsp;
first-ever ship that will be capable of reaching&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:56.480
the center of our planet. The ship will be a&nbsp;
multi-compartment vessel called the Virgil.
&nbsp;

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:01.840
Zimsky is responsible for calculating the scale&nbsp;
of the explosion needed to restart the rotation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:07.120
of the core. Beck and Bob will pilot the ship&nbsp;
while Serge is in charge of initiating the nuclear&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:12.880
reaction. Three months later, the ship is almost&nbsp;
ready. The members train and prepare themselves&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:18.000
for the mission. During this time, Josh and Beck&nbsp;
start to harbor feelings for each other. Before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.480
the team can start the mission, an aggressive&nbsp;
thunderstorm starts striking the planet’s surface&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:27.360
which further brings back the mission’s deadline.&nbsp;
The team finally travels to the South Pacific,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:32.000
from where the ship Virgil waits for them. 
They board the ship and after getting a green&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.280
light from the mission control, Virgil finally&nbsp;
takes a dive into the Pacific ocean. They are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:43.920
welcomed by whales swimming alongside them. In no&nbsp;
time, the ship reaches the depth. The ultrasonic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:48.960
lasers work their magic and the ship manages to&nbsp;
pierce through the ground. After the first twelve&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:54.080
hours, the ship has reached 700 miles below the&nbsp;
earth’s surface. They are currently traveling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.080 --> 00:06:03.680
through the mantle and are about to enter the&nbsp;
empty space. They hadn’t taken the space into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.520
consideration during the preparation so they&nbsp;
brace themselves for aggressive turbulence. 
&nbsp;

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:13.760
The ship then enters an area full of purple&nbsp;
crystals. Unfortunately for the crew, the ship&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:19.680
is stopped when one crystal jams the ultrasonic&nbsp;
laser. The only way to fix the problem is by going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:25.920
out and removing the crystal manually. Everyone&nbsp;
except for Beck steps out and is mesmerized by the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:32.480
view. As Braz and Josh cut the crystal that jammed&nbsp;
the laser, hot lava starts pouring nearby. Zimsky&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:37.680
quickly runs inside the ship leaving the others by&nbsp;
themselves. They finally manage to cut the crystal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:42.880
that was blocking the ship but Josh runs out of&nbsp;
oxygen and falls unconscious in the process. 
&nbsp;

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:48.400
Luckily, Serge manages to save his friend’s life&nbsp;
and brings him inside. Bob is outside seeing if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:53.280
the laser still works. Beck turns them on and&nbsp;
the two are delighted when it starts working.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:59.840
However, just then, a crystal falls on Bob and&nbsp;
punctures his suit. He falls onto the hot lava&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:04.800
and dies. Beck freezes in shock seeing&nbsp;
her partner fall into a pit of fire.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:08.720
She quickly composes herself and gets&nbsp;
on Bob’s seat to restart the ship.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:13.680
Virgil dives into the molten lava narrowly&nbsp;
escaping the falling crystals. 
&nbsp;

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:18.400
Josh regains consciousness and is told about&nbsp;
Bob. They mourn their teammates’ death and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:22.560
are faced with the harsh reality that they&nbsp;
can die at any moment in the mission. 
&nbsp;

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:27.680
It is now the second day since the mission&nbsp;
started, Josh, Serge, and Braz are in the weapons&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:32.400
compartment when suddenly the ship goes through&nbsp;
turbulence. Beck advises the group to get out of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:36.880
there as they will have to eject the compartment&nbsp;
to stop the ship from malfunctioning. The three&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:42.000
run outside but Serge realizes that he left his&nbsp;
charges and launch codes in the compartment.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.800
Without them, they won’t be able to initiate the&nbsp;
nuclear reactor. He goes inside the compartment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:52.400
and hands Josh the codes but is locked there&nbsp;
in the process. To save him, Josh asks Beck to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:56.960
override the ejection system. But Zimsky tells&nbsp;
her that the whole ship will have to face the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:03.040
consequences. The life of one person should not&nbsp;
put the life of humanity in danger. Hearing this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:08.320
Beck makes the decision to sacrifice Serge.
Eventually, Serge is crushed and the compartment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:13.680
is ejected. Josh cries watching his friend&nbsp;
die through a monitor. Sometime later,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:18.480
the mission control sees that Virgil is about&nbsp;
to finally enter the earth’s core. When it does,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:22.960
it goes at a higher speed than they had predicted.&nbsp;
Beck believes this is a good thing because they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:27.440
can complete the mission sooner but Zimsky figures&nbsp;
out that they will not be able to rotate the core&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:32.080
because of the unexpected density. According to&nbsp;
him, they should abort the mission and return to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:37.360
the surface, but the group disagrees. Regardless,&nbsp;
he informs the mission control about the situation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:41.200
and tells them they will have to abort. The&nbsp;
mission control puts their backup plan into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:47.760
action. The backup plan is a top-secret project&nbsp;
"DESTINI" (Deep Earth Seismic Trigger INItiative).&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:53.040
The group finds out that DESTINI is an old project&nbsp;
led by Zimsky. It was intended to be used as a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:58.160
weapon by the U.S. However, when it was first&nbsp;
tested, it caused the core's rotation to stop.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:02.480
Hence, Zimsky and his team were&nbsp;
the reason for the chaos all along,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:07.120
but didn’t tell anyone to avoid taking&nbsp;
accountability. The scientists believe that using&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:12.160
the DESTINI can restart the core but according to&nbsp;
Josh, it will only destroy the planet further. 
&nbsp;

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:17.040
The Lieutenant is ordered to start the project&nbsp;
DESTINI and bring Virgil back. But Josh suggests&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:21.680
that they continue with the original plan and&nbsp;
asks the Lieutenant to launch DESTINI only if they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:27.440
fail. However, Zimsky retaliates, saying that if&nbsp;
they do not get out before DESTINI is initiated,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:32.320
they will surely die. On the surface, the lack&nbsp;
of an electromagnetic field causes a ripple&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:37.680
in the atmosphere. The heat from the sun melts&nbsp;
the golden gate bridge and the area around it. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:43.200
team doesn’t have long before project DESTINI&nbsp;
initiates. Josh manages to contact hacker Bat&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:48.720
secretly and tells him to hack into the mainframe&nbsp;
and stop DESTINI from starting. Josh and Braz try&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:52.720
to figure out a way they can restart the&nbsp;
core. Zimsky suggests they create a ripple&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:57.120
effect by changing the time of detonations.&nbsp;
They are relieved to see the simulation of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:01.920
the process is a success but the group knows&nbsp;
that the execution will not be as easy. 
&nbsp;

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:07.280
After reaching 2600 miles inside the surface,&nbsp;
they finally enter the innermost core.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:11.840
Zimsky suggests they eject each compartment&nbsp;
with the nuclear war force but they will have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:16.800
to modify the ship’s gear to make it possible. The&nbsp;
only problem is that to modify the gear, someone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:22.320
will have to go inside a tiny compartment where&nbsp;
the temperature is extremely high. Basically,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:26.880
whoever goes in will definitely die. 
They use sticks to decide who will do the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:33.120
task. Braz gets the shorter end and accepts his&nbsp;
fate. He wears a suit and hugs his members goodbye&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:38.000
before going into the compartment. The temperature&nbsp;
is extremely high but Braz's suit protects him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.560
temporarily. He successfully modifies the&nbsp;
compartment and completes his mission but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:48.160
unfortunately, dies in the process. The group&nbsp;
does not have time to mourn his death. Then,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:52.720
Zimsky and Josh take the nuclear weapons&nbsp;
to each compartment for them to be ejected.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:57.840
Back on the surface, the DESTINI project is&nbsp;
stopped when Bat hacks the project stimulator. 
&nbsp;

00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:01.360
In Virgil, two of the compartments are&nbsp;
successfully ejected but when they are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:05.760
at the third one, turbulence hits.&nbsp;
The weapon rolls over Zimsky’s legs,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:11.760
trapping him in the compartment. He asks Josh to&nbsp;
run away as he stays behind waiting for his death.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:17.520
Josh finally completes the mission of ejecting the&nbsp;
weapons. Suddenly, the ship stops working and Josh&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:22.800
and Beck sit together awaiting their last moment.&nbsp;
But just then, Josh tells Beck that they can use&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:28.240
the heat from the core to restart the ship. 
Zimsky, who is still alive in the compartment,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:34.240
laughs hysterically as the explosion goes off. The&nbsp;
series of explosions cause the core to spin again.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:40.480
The mission has finally been completed and the&nbsp;
world is saved. However, Josh and Beck still&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:45.840
struggle to save their lives. They finally manage&nbsp;
to restart the ship using the heat from the core,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:51.600
and kiss in joy. Virgil makes its way to the&nbsp;
surface at high speed. However, once they reach&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:56.400
the surface, the mission loses its connection&nbsp;
with the ship. They see its location and figure&nbsp;&nbsp;

them as heroes who saved the planet earth.
