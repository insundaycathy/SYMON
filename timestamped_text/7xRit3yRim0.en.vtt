00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:04.160
You've been invited to play a game of&nbsp;
Would You Rather, that could solve all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.400
your problems. But every choice you make&nbsp;
is going to be awful. You'll have to beat,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.640
out-game, overthrow and down the other&nbsp;
players, if you want to win the ultimate prize.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.760
But do you have what it takes? When you're&nbsp;
trapped in a room with desperate people,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.920
willing to hurt you for cash, what do you do?&nbsp;
I'm going to break down the mistakes made,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.200
what you should do in how to beat&nbsp;
the death game in "Would You Rather".

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.160
This one, Iris desperately needs money&nbsp;
for her brother's bone marrow transplant,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.560
and she'd do anything to make sure he gets it.&nbsp;
Her brother's doctor wants to help and introduces&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.640
her to this wealthy philanthropist who offers to&nbsp;
cover her brother's bone marrow transplant, but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.040
there's one catch. She'll have to come and play&nbsp;
a game, and will only get the money if she wins.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.520
The doctor confirms this guy's legit as he was&nbsp;
a winner of the last game and got a lot of money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.480
out of it. It's extremely generous and she asks to&nbsp;
think it over. All right, there's already enough&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.800
here to tell me this is a sketchy deal. If he&nbsp;
wanted to donate his wealth to people in need,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.360
making a private game out of it is completely&nbsp;
unnecessary. There must be an ulterior motive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.760
here. But this girl doesn't have a lot of options.
A bone marrow transplant can cost up to $675,000,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.000
which is insane. If she worked three jobs,&nbsp;
like the one she applies for at this restaurant&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.840
and didn't spend a penny for eight years, she&nbsp;
still wouldn't have enough money to afford the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.240
procedure. If it's my brother, I'd still join&nbsp;
any game short of an undergrad rush roulette&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.400
ring to make sure he could live, but not without&nbsp;
some basic questions answered first. If we're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.440
going to play a game, we need more information to&nbsp;
prepare, study it and devise a strategy to win.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.200
This girl didn't even asked what the&nbsp;
game was and that was her first mistake.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.600
The best source of information is the doctor&nbsp;
here because he was the winner of the last game.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.240
I wouldn't leave until he told me his advice and&nbsp;
strategies so I have a competitive advantage.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.080
After returning home, she finds that she's&nbsp;
been rejected from her recent job application&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.120
and she realizes her brother will die a slow and&nbsp;
painful death unless she decides to join the game.&nbsp;

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.200
The next evening, she heads over to the mansion&nbsp;
where the event is being held and meets seven&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.520
other guests. It's a real mixed bag of people.&nbsp;
There's a woman in a wheelchair, a professional&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.320
gambler from Vegas and even an Iraq war veteran.&nbsp;
All of them are here out of sheer desperation and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.480
looking for a chance to win big, but none of them&nbsp;
are prepared for the horrors they'll be facing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:13.760
tonight. Okay. They might all seem friendly right&nbsp;
now, but this is a room full of desperate people,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.520
which makes them dangerous and we should&nbsp;
expect they're all sizing up the competition,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.600
so we should too. We can actually tell a lot&nbsp;
about these people based on their positioning&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.080
in the room, body language, and drink selection.&nbsp;
Every single one of them is drinking alcohol,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.800
except this guy who just has water. This seems&nbsp;
irrelevant, but it's incredibly important.&nbsp;

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.480
If you're about to play a game, you want to&nbsp;
be sober. It tells me this guy's taking the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.280
competition more seriously than the others and&nbsp;
is already strategizing. If they offer me drinks,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.920
I am refusing. I can also tell that this girl and&nbsp;
this veteran have trust issues because they've&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.680
distanced themselves from everyone else in the&nbsp;
room. They're not here to make friends. They're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.160
here to win. And I expect that neither of them&nbsp;
will easily cooperate with the group. The brother&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.840
comes in and tells the guests to remove any of&nbsp;
their personal belongings before they enter the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.680
game as a way to make sure they don't cheat.&nbsp;
It makes them feel nervous, but with money on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.200
the line, everyone hands their phones and bags&nbsp;
over and makes their way to the dining room.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.040
Okay? We are playing a game and&nbsp;
phones might be an easy way to cheat.&nbsp;

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.520
So handing them over is actually a reasonable&nbsp;
request, but this is exactly why I would do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.680
everything I could to take mine inside. If I'm&nbsp;
already desperate enough to be here in the first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.000
place, why would I suddenly want to play by the&nbsp;
rules? If my brother's life hangs in the balance,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.160
I need every advantage, fair or not, to gain the&nbsp;
upper hand. When they ask for my phone, I would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.320
tuck it inside my waistband behind my belt, and&nbsp;
simply say that I didn't bring it with me. There's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:33.920
no metal detection, no x-ray, not even a pat down.&nbsp;
This is a flaw that we can and should exploit.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.000
Dinner starts and they're served the main course&nbsp;
of steak and foie gras. But Iris here has some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.800
gripes. She's a strict vegetarian who swore to&nbsp;
never eat meat. And this is where the night starts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:48.240
to get interesting. The host offers her $10,000 to&nbsp;
give up her lifelong commitment and eat the steak.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:53.200
She refuses at first, but everyone has a price&nbsp;
as she takes that deal and swallows her pride.&nbsp;

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:58.080
He then notices the old man here is drinking only&nbsp;
water and finds out he's a recovering alcoholic.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:03.280
Offering him $50,000, he ups the ante and&nbsp;
tells him to drink at entire scotch decanter.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.600
After a lot of hesitation, he finally&nbsp;
gives up 16 years of hard-fought sobriety.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.000
Okay. There's a pattern building here. The host&nbsp;
wants to make us do things that go against our&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.400
principles and morals for cold, hard cash.&nbsp;
Fortunately, this can be easily manipulated&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.480
because both of these challenges were based on&nbsp;
information that they volunteered. I would create&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.240
a lie that would make him give me easy challenges&nbsp;
that I didn't morally object to, such as telling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.720
him I'm Jewish and only eat kosher. I might even&nbsp;
say I'm celibate just to see what happens. Now,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.160
this is probably going to escalate quickly.&nbsp;
And if we stay too long, he might be asking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.920
us to do things that are downright evil.
With a room of desperate people, only God&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:39.280
knows what some of them might be capable&nbsp;
of, especially when things start getting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.440
competitive. We should be taking this opportunity&nbsp;
to grab as much cash as possible in these simple&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:48.000
isolated challenges and leave before it gets out&nbsp;
of hand. The host then reveals the main event of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.320
the evening. They will all be playing a game of&nbsp;
Would You Rather with some important differences.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:57.360
In each round, every player be given two&nbsp;
unpleasant choices with only 15 seconds to choose.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.440
They're eliminated if they don't act in time,&nbsp;
and the last remaining player wins the game.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.360
Before they start, he offers them a chance&nbsp;
to leave. But no one gets up and the game&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:10.160
begins. The host reveals that his butler&nbsp;
used to be an interrogator for MI5 as he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.720
brings out one of his old tools for torture, and&nbsp;
they'll be using it to electrocute their guests.&nbsp;

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:18.800
The alcoholic wants no part of this and tries&nbsp;
to leave, but the butler makes it clear that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:24.320
no longer an option by shooting him in the&nbsp;
head. If they want out alive, they need to win.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:28.320
All right, this is messed up. And not just&nbsp;
because they've skipped dessert. If it's me,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:31.920
I'm paying close attention to the Iraq war&nbsp;
veteran. He would have the best instincts in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:35.920
a life-threatening situation. And if he's not&nbsp;
moving into striking distance of the gunman,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:39.360
it's fair to say we don't have a good chance&nbsp;
to fight our way out of this. We need to play&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:43.520
the game until we have a better opportunity to&nbsp;
escape and now it's all about making the best&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:48.320
choices to keep everyone alive for as long as&nbsp;
possible. Now we have only 15 seconds to make&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:52.880
difficult decisions, which gives us very little&nbsp;
time to explore the consequences of each choice.&nbsp;

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:56.080
This thing's a torture device. So we'll&nbsp;
likely have to choose between two different&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.120
forms of pain, which is scaring the&nbsp;
(beep) out of everyone at the table.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:03.520
In high pressure situations like this one, the&nbsp;
brain is influenced by fear, panic, and cognitive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:07.600
bias and we tend to compensate for these by&nbsp;
oversimplifying our options. But there's actually&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:11.760
a way to bypass all of these mental blocks to&nbsp;
lie to make better and more rational decisions.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:15.680
Professional chess players use a decision making&nbsp;
tactic in their games that psychologists call&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:20.080
combinatorial versus positional thinking where&nbsp;
a player makes a series of moves based on a very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:24.320
specific final outcome in mind, and it lets them&nbsp;
make strategic sacrifices to achieve their final&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:28.480
goal. Now, most people in this situation would&nbsp;
have based their decisions on avoiding pain,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:32.800
but that's a mistake because it limits your&nbsp;
thinking and strategy to only a momentary goal.&nbsp;

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:37.280
The final outcome here is not to suffer less&nbsp;
pain, it's to win and survive. This type of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:41.120
strategic thinking helps bypass intuitive&nbsp;
and emotional responses and make better&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:45.520
decisions to gain the advantage. The butler puts&nbsp;
a headband on this guy and he's asked if he would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:50.400
rather electrocute himself or Amy here. The host&nbsp;
starts the clock. And just before time runs out,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:56.160
he decides to shock himself and they say chivalry&nbsp;
is dead, but he's voluntarily weakened himself&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:00.480
without gaining anything in return. If it's me,&nbsp;
I'm choosing to shock someone else because it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:04.800
increases my chance of winning if others are too&nbsp;
injured to continue the game. He's actually given&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:09.440
everyone an advantage because they now have more&nbsp;
information to work with. If we know what we're in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:13.760
for, we can plan for it better. This guy is still&nbsp;
conscious and doesn't have any burn marks, which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:18.160
means the electrical potential is too low to stop&nbsp;
your heart and you can survive a single shock.&nbsp;

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:22.960
Now there are some things we can do to lessen the&nbsp;
pain here. Water is a conductor of electricity. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:27.680
if I was next, I would dry any sweat from my&nbsp;
forehead because wet skin has 500 times less&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:31.760
resistance to electricity and it will hurt&nbsp;
much more. We could also consider cheating.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:35.360
If you were brave enough and halfway decent at&nbsp;
slight of hand, you could try slipping a credit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:39.920
card between your skin and the electrodes because&nbsp;
plastic is an insulator and thin enough to hide.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:44.160
The next two players in line gets strapped&nbsp;
in, but Amy here wastes no time and instantly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:48.560
chucks the old woman like it's nothing. She's&nbsp;
cold blooded. The old woman is given the same&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:52.000
choice and she chooses to shock the gambler.&nbsp;
They go around the table and finish the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.160
first round with Lucas and Iris here, the only&nbsp;
other players who decide the shock themselves.&nbsp;

00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:00.560
Okay, there are actually two ways to play this&nbsp;
as a team. And that was for everyone to either&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:05.440
unanimously decide to shock themselves or to shock&nbsp;
others. Only these two options will have a fair&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:09.840
outcome because everyone gets shocked only once,&nbsp;
but this strategy requires a hundred percent trust&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:13.280
and no rogue decision-makers. And when&nbsp;
the challenges get more brutal, we won't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:17.280
be able to rely on others that think about the&nbsp;
group over themselves. And this tells me group&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:21.760
decision-making would be a bad strategy. The staff&nbsp;
prepare for the second round. With their only&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:26.240
chance, the group secretly discuss taking down&nbsp;
the guards, stealing their guns, and taking their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:30.880
keys to escape the house. Before they can come to&nbsp;
any agreement, the host's son, Julian, comes into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:35.280
taunt them. The veteran starts mouthing off and&nbsp;
the son makes it clear that he'll regret it later.&nbsp;

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:40.240
All right, bad decisions are made and you let&nbsp;
emotions get the better of you. Now, studies show&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:44.320
fear drives people to make pessimistic decisions&nbsp;
and angry people will make optimistic ones.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:48.080
Deciding to curse this guy out optimistically&nbsp;
assumes that there will be no consequences,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:52.320
and that's stupid. We already know that the host&nbsp;
will have us killed without blinking an eye.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:55.760
I'd want to stay quiet so I don't get any&nbsp;
special attention. Now it's cold-blooded,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:59.600
but I'd also encourage others to speak out and&nbsp;
get emotionally triggered. This situation is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:03.760
scary as hell, and I'd be pessimistic enough to&nbsp;
think there's no way out of this without winning.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:07.360
Meanwhile, Iris's doctor has snuck onto&nbsp;
the property. He won the last game,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:10.960
so he must know what's going on and it looks like&nbsp;
he's here to help them. But he can't take out all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:14.800
the guards by himself. So they'll have to survive&nbsp;
the next round until he can figure out what to do.&nbsp;

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:19.440
Okay. There's no reason for this doctor to be&nbsp;
on the property. If he actually wanted to save&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:22.720
lives and avoid suspicion from the host, he&nbsp;
should have stayed home and called the police&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:26.320
or the fire department from a burner phone&nbsp;
to avoid any trace of the call back to him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:30.080
If the authorities get involved, it gives&nbsp;
the guests an opportunity to escape. This&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:34.560
guy doesn't consider any of this. And if he was my&nbsp;
doctor, I'd definitely seeking a second opinion.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:38.480
The next round has begun. And this time they&nbsp;
will have 30 seconds to make their decision,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:43.280
but the choices will be a lot more sadistic. The&nbsp;
first player to go is Iris. And she's asked if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:47.440
she would rather stab this guy's thigh with an ice&nbsp;
pick or whip the veteran with a staff three times.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:52.080
Okay. Things are getting really serious now.&nbsp;
We have to be a lot more careful with our&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:55.360
decisions because not only could they kill&nbsp;
someone, but we should also be expecting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:59.120
retaliation if we make the wrong choice.
I'd be very tempted to beat someone as a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:03.600
lesser punishment. But in this case, choosing the&nbsp;
ice pick is actually the safer of the two options.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:08.080
This whipping step is called a Sjambok and it's&nbsp;
a (beep) nightmare. Often made from a hippo or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:12.240
rhino hide and used by cattle herders in South&nbsp;
African police during apartheid, this thing can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:16.160
cause enough damage to experience symptoms of&nbsp;
crushed syndrome, which leads to kidney failure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:20.800
and rhabdomyolysis, which kills muscle fibers and&nbsp;
releases it into the bloodstream. A shallow stab&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:25.360
of the thigh, however, can be quickly treated,&nbsp;
but placement is absolutely fine. Stabbing someone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:29.120
on the outermost side of their leg avoids their&nbsp;
major arteries. And depending on someone's build,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:32.640
there can be a thicker layer of subcutaneous&nbsp;
fat on the thighs, which might decrease the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:37.440
chances of causing a life-threatening injury.
Iris decides to use the African whipping staff,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:41.440
but the bigger mistake here was letting him take&nbsp;
off his jacket because he's removing a layer of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:46.080
protection. She tries to take it easy on him, but&nbsp;
the host won't count them unless she uses bold&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:50.640
force. Now, the back has a lot of weak points.&nbsp;
There are vital organs, nerves, and bones without&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:54.720
a lot of muscle or fat to protect them, making&nbsp;
it much more dangerous. This guy didn't specify&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:58.320
where to hit him. So if you had to use the staff,&nbsp;
then you should aim for the butt or thighs and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:02.480
forearms. Dominatrices target these an impact&nbsp;
play because they have a higher pain threshold&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:06.720
than the rest of the body. So getting a little&nbsp;
kinky might actually save your life. The next&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:11.280
guy is given the same choice. He can either stab&nbsp;
the woman or whip the veteran three more times.&nbsp;

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:14.800
He knows there's a major artery in the thigh&nbsp;
that could kill her, but isn't sure where it is.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:19.360
So he chooses to be the soldier again. This guy's&nbsp;
taking it like a champ. Luckily it's the veteran's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:24.240
turn next and he's given a choice to stab this&nbsp;
guy, or get whipped three times by the butler.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:28.320
Surprisingly, he chooses the whip. This guy begs&nbsp;
the veteran to stab him, but the host says he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:33.040
can't change his mind. Okay. He's clearly being&nbsp;
singled out because he stood up to the host's son&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:37.040
and it's hard to watch, but it's also a direct&nbsp;
benefit to every other player in the game.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:41.280
The most practical decision here is to use this&nbsp;
as an opportunity to take out a competitor and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:44.960
improve your chances of winning. So when it's&nbsp;
our turn, we should make our decision based&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:48.720
not on what keeps him in the game, but on the&nbsp;
most compassionate way to take him out of it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:52.080
The best solution for a merciful exit&nbsp;
from the game that's offend the rules,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:56.400
is to stab someone in the femoral artery because&nbsp;
it's a major supplier of blood to the lower body.&nbsp;

00:11:56.400 --> 00:12:00.080
This artery is primarily centered around the&nbsp;
inner thigh, so aim for somewhere around here and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:03.680
they'll die in a matter of minutes if they don't&nbsp;
get help. It's cruel, but there are two ways out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:08.240
of here. You're either the winner or get sent&nbsp;
out in a body bag. It's the gamblers turn now,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:11.760
and he's given the choice of either whipping&nbsp;
the veteran who could die from his wounds or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:15.600
stabbed the paralyzed woman next to him. He&nbsp;
rationalizes that she won't feel the pain&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:20.240
because she's paralyzed. And he stabs her in the&nbsp;
thigh, accidentally piercing an artery. He makes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:24.240
a tourniquet with his belt to stop the bleeding as&nbsp;
the woman decides if she wants to whip the soldier&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:28.160
or stab Amy here. She gives her answer and&nbsp;
quickly stabs a goth girl with the ice pick,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:32.960
but wasn't expecting to get elbowed in the face.
The gambler made the right move here. The vet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:36.960
is on his way out and the old woman can't feel&nbsp;
her legs, so if he aims for the femoral artery,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:41.200
he could eliminate her painlessly. That's two for&nbsp;
the price of one. And it's a perfectly rational&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:45.760
strategy to cut down the pool of competitors. His&nbsp;
reaction here is a great way to garner empathy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:50.400
because even though he stabs her, he also decides&nbsp;
to help her once he sees how severe her wound is.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:53.760
Acting morally conflicted makes him appear&nbsp;
less evil. And the other players might be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:58.080
less likely to target him as a result. On the&nbsp;
other hand, if you act cold and calculating,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:01.920
you make it easier for others to see you as&nbsp;
someone they should take out quickly. Emotions and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:06.000
instinct play a huge role in fast decision-making.
So if you dehumanize yourself and give them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.920
a justification to punish you, they'll have no&nbsp;
problems hurting or eliminating someone they think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:14.880
is a bad guy. Now it's this woman's turn, and the&nbsp;
host decides to make things more interesting. She&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:19.760
can either whip the soldier or stab anyone she&nbsp;
chooses. She makes it clear to everyone that this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:24.720
is a competition where teamwork does not pay off&nbsp;
and she's dead set on winning this. She chooses&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:29.360
Iris as her target and asks the host if she can&nbsp;
stab her anywhere. He tells her she can stab only&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:34.080
below the shoulder and immediately the girl jams&nbsp;
the ice pick into her side. It didn't penetrate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:37.920
the lungs. So she's going to be okay, but as&nbsp;
she's recovering, the veteran collapses from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:43.120
his injuries and isn't getting up. Okay, they've&nbsp;
introduced a new choice into this game. And this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:47.760
is important to our strategy because we can now&nbsp;
selectively target who to injure. With one person&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:52.000
eliminated and two on the way out, we should&nbsp;
consider who's most likely to survive the longest.&nbsp;

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.320
Out of all of them, the old lady is the weakest&nbsp;
due to her age and fatal stab world. So I'd want&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:56.320 --> 00:14:00.160
to keep her around. These two guys are healthy&nbsp;
enough to take quite a beating, but they've also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:04.080
shown a willingness to sacrifice themselves for&nbsp;
the group. So they might be easier to manipulate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:07.920
and are therefore less threatening. Amy's&nbsp;
most likely going to stab others in the back,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:11.840
which makes her the first person you should take&nbsp;
out, as she's too dangerous to be left alive.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:15.760
Iris here is in this for her brother, so she'd&nbsp;
do anything to make sure he gets what he needs,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:20.320
making her just as dangerous. As for the gambler,&nbsp;
I expect he's better at calculating probabilities&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:24.880
and risk assessment and will eliminate any other&nbsp;
competitors who get in his way. If they give us&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:29.760
the freedom to choose, the top three people we&nbsp;
need to take out are Amy, Iris, and the gambler&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:33.680
and winning the game depends on making sure your&nbsp;
last remaining competition is weaker than you.&nbsp;

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:38.080
Downstairs in the basement, the doctor is breaking&nbsp;
in. And he's decided he has to do something about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:42.640
this to rescues his friend Iris before she dies&nbsp;
in the game. The butler determines the soldier's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:46.720
unconscious, but still able to play. But they&nbsp;
realize the old woman has quietly died from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:51.280
her wound and she gets eliminated. It's now this&nbsp;
guy's turn to choose and he decides to beat the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:56.240
veterans so hard that he can't continue, leaving&nbsp;
five people left to play. But before the weapons&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:56.240 --> 00:15:00.400
change hands, the players make signals to each&nbsp;
other and they wait until the host starts speaking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:04.320
with his butler to seize their opportunity. The&nbsp;
three men attack the guards. They're striking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:07.920
them as Iris here runs out of the room.&nbsp;
The host shoots one of the players dead&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:11.680
and ushers the remaining guests to the table.
But when he realizes that someone is missing,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:15.200
he commands his butler to find the&nbsp;
woman and lets his son join the search.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:19.520
Okay. This was their best chance at escaping and&nbsp;
they took it. We have two weapons that we didn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:23.280
have in the first round and they would have been&nbsp;
taken away once the next one starts. So it was a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:27.920
perfect time to strike and they nearly got away,&nbsp;
but they made a few mistakes here. The first was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:32.160
assuming the hosts don't carry guns. There's no&nbsp;
way I'm thinking they aren't armed for any number&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:35.840
of unexpected outcomes, and if they've been doing&nbsp;
this for years, they would know better. This guy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:39.760
should have left as soon as he had the chance&nbsp;
instead of walking up to the host. Secondly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:43.280
splitting up would divide the outnumbered guards,&nbsp;
giving someone the opportunity to look for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:47.280
confiscated cell phones, then call the police.
The windows aren't barred, so I would look for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:51.360
a room on the first floor with a window and lock&nbsp;
myself in. Meanwhile, you should grab a knife in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:55.280
case you need to force open any locked doors in&nbsp;
the escape. This is actually not that hard to do.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:58.880
As long as the slanted part of the latch bolt&nbsp;
is facing you, the knife can slip into the small&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:02.960
crack of the wall to force it open and you can&nbsp;
run away. Iris here tries to break out through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:07.520
the basement window with the host soon finds her&nbsp;
and tries to take advantage. She fights back and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:12.000
stabs him in the leg. Her doctor suddenly shows&nbsp;
up and tries to rescue her, but seconds later, he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:17.040
gets shot by the butler who takes Iris and back to&nbsp;
the game. Okay? This encounter here has made a lot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:20.640
of noise. And when you're running from the guards,&nbsp;
you have to expect they'll be drawn to the sound.&nbsp;

00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:24.320
The doctor should've considered hiding the dark&nbsp;
and wait for a guard to show up so he could&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:28.960
easily ambush him and save Iris. Even still,&nbsp;
wandering into the house got him killed. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:33.920
all he had to do was make an anonymous phone call&nbsp;
to the police and mention gunshots. As for Iris,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:38.560
this is a difficult situation. She stabbed this&nbsp;
guy in the leg. We saw how vengeful he was to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:42.720
soldier. If we get caught and dragged back to the&nbsp;
game, we'll die for sure. So with this in mind,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:46.560
I'm deciding to stab in the neck for the kill&nbsp;
and run out of the hallway so I'm not caught&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:51.120
standing over the body. Returning to the game, the&nbsp;
guards bring out a barrel of water. In this round,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:55.360
each player will be given a sealed envelope. And&nbsp;
inside is a card with a punishment written on it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:59.120
They have 30 seconds to choose between&nbsp;
being held down under water for two minutes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:03.520
or take their chances with the envelope.
Okay? As soon as I see the tub full of water,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:07.520
I know where this is going. So before even being&nbsp;
presented a choice, I'm going to start breathing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:12.160
exercises to prepare in advance. Also, opening&nbsp;
the envelope takes away your ability to make an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:16.720
informed choice. Now, with that said, two minutes&nbsp;
held underwater is totally possible to survive.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:21.120
The magician, David Blaine, once held his breath&nbsp;
for 17 minutes using a technique that pro divers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:25.600
use known as oxygen assisted static apnea. David&nbsp;
Blaine's method is to take a minute to breathe in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:29.680
and out deeply. Then purge your body from excess&nbsp;
carbon dioxide by inhaling quickly and excelling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:33.920
strongly. If you do this, a normal person with&nbsp;
no prior experience can hold their breath twice&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:37.600
as long as they would normally. The trick here&nbsp;
is to keep as still as possible in the water,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:41.440
slowing down your heart rate and not get panicked&nbsp;
and thrash because the body will send oxygen to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:45.440
the muscles, creating more carbon dioxide buildup&nbsp;
and making it much harder to hold your breath.&nbsp;

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:49.600
Thankfully, we as humans have the mammalian&nbsp;
dive reflex, which naturally once our faces&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:53.280
are submerged. This will cause your heart rate&nbsp;
to decrease narrowing the blood vessels to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:57.280
ensure that organs like the brain and the heart&nbsp;
have a continued supply of oxygen. The gambler&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:01.200
goes first and decides to take a gamble on the&nbsp;
envelope. Finding out he must light a firecracker&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:05.440
in his hand. It seems like he got lucky, but&nbsp;
instead he's handed something much bigger.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:09.600
The host assures that if it's a dud, he'll get a&nbsp;
free pass, but to make sure he doesn't drop it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:13.680
they tape it to his hand and force him to light&nbsp;
the fuse at gunpoint. The explosion turns his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:18.000
hand into bloody chunks. He dies from a heart&nbsp;
attack, leaving three players left to play.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:22.880
Okay, this guy mentions it's a quarter stick, but&nbsp;
based on its size and the description provided by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:27.280
the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, it&nbsp;
looks more like an M80, because an actual M1000&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:30.160
quarter stick is six inches long.
That ain't no six inches,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:34.800
trust me. These explosives are illegal to own&nbsp;
without a license because they're so dangerous.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:39.200
There's no way out of this situation other than&nbsp;
to cheat. He had more than 30 seconds before the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:42.800
explosive went off. So I would have tried using&nbsp;
my fingers to slowly pull the wick out of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:46.800
explosive container and rip it out of the socket&nbsp;
it's glued into. This might convince them it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:51.280
a dud and I'll get to keep both my hands. Lucas&nbsp;
here decides he'll open up the envelope. And he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:56.560
discovers his punishment is to slit his eye open,&nbsp;
is given a razor blade and 30 seconds to do it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:56.560 --> 00:19:00.800
but he doesn't think he can. It's too scary.&nbsp;
Still, he holds the blade to his eye and when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:05.360
there's only three seconds left, he slices it&nbsp;
open. All right, this is where you'd lose me.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:09.680
I can't even watch people put their contacts in.
So slitting my own eye is just too damn hard. But&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:13.280
there might be a way to do this properly without&nbsp;
losing your sight. The eye is one of the fastest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:16.720
healing parts of the body. So you should look&nbsp;
away to avoid the pupil and slice the whites of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:20.640
your eye only. In order to avoid further damage,&nbsp;
you should keep your eyes closed. If you look&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:24.320
around with one eye, the other eye follows because&nbsp;
they're paired together. I won't be able to see,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:28.240
but I probably won't need to in order to win and&nbsp;
able to protect my eye from further damage. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:32.160
next player, Iris, bravely decides to take the&nbsp;
water barrel instead. And it's not easy, but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:36.560
she manages to last the whole two minutes, much&nbsp;
to the host's surprise. It's a good thing too,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:40.240
because if she had chosen the envelope,&nbsp;
all her teeth would have been extracted.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:44.080
This leaves Amy, here to go next and she chooses&nbsp;
the envelope rather than the water barrel.&nbsp;

00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:48.880
But as she discovers, her punishment is being&nbsp;
held under water for four minutes instead of two.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:53.760
And unlike Iris, she does not make it. This leaves&nbsp;
only two players left. And the host reveals for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:58.960
this final round things will be very different.&nbsp;
The butler flips a coin and Iris gets to go first.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:02.880
Her choice is simple, would she rather end this&nbsp;
game now with both players leaving empty handed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:07.280
or would she rather kill Lucas here with this&nbsp;
pistol. Okay. She's been handed the keys to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:11.280
freedom, but there's more actual decision-making&nbsp;
here than meets the eye. If she walks away,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:15.680
they both live, there's no reward, and her&nbsp;
brother inevitably dies. If she shoots him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:20.080
this man dies, but her brother lives. So&nbsp;
ultimately this decision is actually between&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:23.920
the life of this man or the life of her brother.
If we were thinking about the greater good,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:27.840
we would take into consideration how many people&nbsp;
this man cares for and how many people his death&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:32.080
negatively effects. It has a ripple effect&nbsp;
to everyone in his life he's responsible for.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:36.320
So if we were being altruistic, this will be the&nbsp;
right course of action. But at the same time,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:40.160
how could I tell my brother I chose a stranger's&nbsp;
life over his. With my brother's life on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:43.840
line and only 30 seconds to decide, I'd&nbsp;
be heavily influenced by emotional and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:47.680
instinctive decision-making and probably would&nbsp;
shoot him in the end. He begs her to choose the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:52.160
first option and tries to convince her to walk&nbsp;
away, but she shoots him and everyone applauds.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:56.240
As the sole winner of the game, she's given her&nbsp;
prize. A bag full of money, a bone marrow donor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:56.240 --> 00:21:00.480
for a brother, and a chance to finally go home.
She gets back to tell her brother the good news&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:05.200
but tragically finds out he's killed himself.&nbsp;
All that torment was for nothing. After such an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:08.400
awful night, I'd take that money and&nbsp;
use it to get some much needed therapy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:12.560
But what do you think? How would you be at Would&nbsp;
You Rather, and what would you rather do? Let&nbsp;&nbsp;
