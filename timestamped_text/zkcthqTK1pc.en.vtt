Hi guys, Korean Movie Recapped here. Before&nbsp;
we start, WARNING! Spoilers Ahead! Today,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:21.360
I’m going to recap a 2016 Korean&nbsp;
Thriller movie called The Handmaiden.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:26.320
In Japanese-occupied Korea, a con man&nbsp;
plans to seduce a Japanese heiress,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.840
marry her, then commit her to an asylum&nbsp;
in order to steal her inheritance.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.960
He plans an elaborate scheme to fulfill his&nbsp;
goal. Will she fall to his cunning plan?

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:41.040
The story starts with a common poor Korean girl,&nbsp;
saying goodbye to what appears to be her family,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.760
before she sets off to a giant mansion to&nbsp;
become the handmaiden of a Japanese heiress,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:52.560
Lady Hideko. Once she arrives, she introduces&nbsp;
herself as Okju to the head maid, Sasaki. She&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:57.920
shows her around the Western-Japanese-styled&nbsp;
mansion and explains the rules. Okju’s main job&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:03.200
is to help Lady Hideko in her daily life as her&nbsp;
personal Handmaiden. On her first night there,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:08.400
she wakes up to Lady Hideko screaming because of a&nbsp;
nightmare. She goes to her room and meets her for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.520
the first time. Lady Hideko tells her the story&nbsp;
when her aunt went mad and hung herself at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:19.280
big cherry tree outside the mansion. Sokju then&nbsp;
sleeps together with Lady Hideko to soothe her.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.000
On the next day, the other maid pranks her by&nbsp;
hiding one of her shoes, making her meet Lady&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.440
Hideko while wearing only her left shoe. She&nbsp;
reintroduces herself to Lady Hideko and gives&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:34.480
her a reference letter from her last mistress.&nbsp;
Lady Hideko asks her to read the letter for her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:40.320
but despite being able to speak in both Korean&nbsp;
and Japanese, Okju is illiterate. Lady Hideko&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.520
doesn’t mind about it and tells Okju to always&nbsp;
be truthful to her. She also notices that Okju&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.960
lost one of her shoes and gives her a new pair&nbsp;
of shoes. After that, Lady Hideko goes to her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.080
reading practice session and tells her to come to&nbsp;
her at noon. While alone, she becomes curious and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:01.440
explores Lady Hideko’s room. She tries on various&nbsp;
clothes and plays with various accessories.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:07.600
At noon, Okju goes to the exquisite reading&nbsp;
room as requested by Lady Hideko. There,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.720
she meets the eccentric Uncle Kouzuki. His tongue&nbsp;
is black due to his habit of licking ink while&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:19.280
reading. Lady Hideko lives with him, a Korean man&nbsp;
who helped the Japanese take over Korea. For it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.720
the Japanese gave him a gold mine. He then uses&nbsp;
this wealth to feed his obsession with rare books.

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.840
Lady Hideko is expecting a guest, so&nbsp;
she takes a bath to prepare herself.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:36.160
While helping her take a bath, Okju admires Lady&nbsp;
Hideko’s beauty and becomes enchanted by it. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.440
guest is Count Fujiwara, a Japanese Nobleman who&nbsp;
is Lady Hideko’s painting teacher and also the one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:47.280
who referred Okju to work there. He goes inside&nbsp;
his room after greeting Lady Hideko. Not long&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.960
after that, he summons Okju to come to his room.&nbsp;
Strangely, they seem to know each other very well.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:59.200
It is quickly revealed that things are not as they&nbsp;
appear. Okju's real name is actually Sook-hee,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:05.120
an orphan raised by Miss Boksun, a top purveyor&nbsp;
of stolen goods. Her mother was a legendary thief.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.560
She grows up learning to pickpocket and forge&nbsp;
stamps. There are other such orphan girls who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.680
have been raised by Miss Boksun. This group&nbsp;
of con artists get abandoned babies, feed them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:21.920
and sell them to Japan. Count Fujiwara is also a&nbsp;
con man who is actually not even a Japanese man,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.720
he is a common Korean man. He approached this&nbsp;
group and invited them to join his scheme.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.280
He has identified a certain single&nbsp;
Japanese heiress, Lady Hideko,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:36.160
who he wants to marry to inherit her fortune.&nbsp;
He hires Sook-hee to play as a handmaiden,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:41.600
becomes his ears, and gently persuades Lady&nbsp;
Hideko to fall in love with Count Fujiwara.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.720
Sook-hee agrees to join his plan for a sum of&nbsp;
money from the inheritance. After Fujiwara gets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.920
the inheritance, he plans on declaring Lady Hideko&nbsp;
insane and sending her off to a mental asylum.

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.400
Count Fujiwara gives Sok-hee a box and&nbsp;
tells her to give it to Lady Hideko.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:02.320
Inside the box are beautiful blue spinel earrings&nbsp;
and a letter, a personal gift from Count Fujiwara&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:07.840
to take Lady Hideko’s heart. She wears it for&nbsp;
tonight's dinner in an elegant white dress. Even&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:13.600
Sok-hee can’t help but admire her beauty. Lady&nbsp;
Hideko becomes a little bit drunk after dinner.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:18.720
She plays as a maid and dresses Sok-hee up in&nbsp;
an elegant black dress and blue spinel earrings,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.080
making Sok-hee as beautiful as&nbsp;
her. They both enjoy the time.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.120
Sok-hee bonds too far with Lady Hideko, making&nbsp;
her have second thoughts about the plan.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.880
But despite that feeling, she&nbsp;
still tries to stick to the plan.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.320
Until one day, she caught Lady Hideko and count&nbsp;
Fujiwara kissing passionately in the woods.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.160
For some reason, it hurts her&nbsp;
feelings so she runs back to her room.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:46.240
On the night, Lady Hideko asks Sok-hee to sleep&nbsp;
with her. She tells Sok-hee that she feels nervous&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:51.920
because Count Fujiwara proposed to her earlier.&nbsp;
She’s not sure whether to accept it or not. She&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:56.720
asks Sok-hee to teach her about the things that&nbsp;
men want. In order to teach her about the world of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:02.640
adults, Sok-hee kisses her on the lips, embraces&nbsp;
her, and touches her. One thing leads to another,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:05.600
they lose control and end up&nbsp;
pleasuring each other on the bed.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:12.080
On the next day, when Count Fujiwara is about&nbsp;
to “devour” Lady Hideko, Sok-hee prevents it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:17.840
This makes him mad at her. He reminds her about&nbsp;
the plan and the consequences if she abandons it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:22.960
Sok-hee agrees to continue the plan as long as&nbsp;
count Fujiwara doesn’t push Lady Hideko too far.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:29.040
Before bed, she tries again to persuade Lady&nbsp;
Hideko to accept Count Fujiwara's proposal.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:33.280
But Lady Hideko tells her that she is already&nbsp;
happy as long as she is with her at the mansion.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:38.160
She asks Sok-hee whether she should accept the&nbsp;
proposal if she is in love with another person&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:43.680
now. This makes Sok-hee confused, whether to&nbsp;
continue the plan or follow her true feelings.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:49.120
But she decides to stick to the plan and persuades&nbsp;
Lady Hideko further to accept the proposal.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:54.080
Her answer makes Lady Hideko disappointed&nbsp;
and slaps her. She casts her out of her room.

00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:00.560
Lady Hideko decides to accept Count Fujiwara’s&nbsp;
proposal. On the day when Uncle Kouzuki leaves&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:05.440
the mansion for business, Lady Hideko and Sok-hee&nbsp;
run away from the mansion and head to Japan with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:11.600
Count Fujiwara. During the trip, Lady Hideko&nbsp;
keeps gazing at Sok-hee. She notices but can’t&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:16.880
do anything about it. Lady Hideko and Count&nbsp;
Fujiwara are finally married at a small shrine.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:23.520
On the night, Lady Hideko tries to kiss her again,&nbsp;
but Sok-hee refuses it. Sok-hee endures her bitter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:27.920
feeling as she sleeps beside the room where&nbsp;
Lady Hideko is having the first night with Count&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:34.000
Fujiwara. In the morning, she comes to the room&nbsp;
to see Lady Hideko. She hates what she sees but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.280
it’s no use crying over spilled milk. She waits&nbsp;
for Count Fujiwara to certify the marriage and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:44.880
convert the inheritance to cash. As she waits,&nbsp;
she fears that Lady Hideko might truly go mad.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:51.040
She wants to run away with her but Count Fujiwara&nbsp;
pays the innkeeper to spy on them. Finally,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:56.480
Count Fujiwara comes with a bag full of cash and&nbsp;
jewelry. Sok-hee accepts it with a mixed feeling.

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:01.840
Not long after that, the people from the&nbsp;
mental asylum come to interview Sok-hee.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:06.800
They ask various questions about Lady Hideko&nbsp;
before they throw her into the mental asylum.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:12.480
Outside the mental asylum, she hugs Lady Hideko&nbsp;
for the last time. Lady Hideko hears the scream&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:17.280
of the people inside the mental asylum and&nbsp;
becomes startled. She walks a few steps back.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:23.600
But unexpectedly, instead of grabbing Lady Hideko,&nbsp;
they try to apprehend Sok-hee. They think that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:28.960
she is Lady Hideko. She tries to explain to&nbsp;
them that she is not her, but Count Fujiwara&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:33.600
and Lady Hideko just stand there and make them&nbsp;
detain Sok-hee under the name of Lady Hideko.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:38.720
She immediately realized that she had been&nbsp;
betrayed by Count Fujiwara and possibly by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:44.240
Lady Hideko too. But is it true? To uncover&nbsp;
the truth, let's take a few steps back.

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:49.840
Lady Hideko’s mother passed&nbsp;
away while giving birth to her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:54.720
so she was raised strictly and harshly by&nbsp;
her uncle. Uncle Kouzuki is obsessed with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.720 --> 00:08:00.080
rare books. But not just any rare books, he&nbsp;
specially dealt in rare erotic art and text.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:05.200
The usual reading practice session Lady Hideko&nbsp;
does with her uncle is in fact him teaching&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:10.720
her to erotically read sadistic pornography&nbsp;
since she was five years old. To secure funds,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:14.880
he held auctions for the books and arts where&nbsp;
her aunt read the erotic books to collectors.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:21.600
He also sold forgeries to further accumulate money&nbsp;
and books. One day, Uncle Kouzuki caught her aunt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:27.120
trying to run away, so he torture her in a secret&nbsp;
torture room in the basement. The psychological&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:32.160
and physical abuse gradually degrades the sanity&nbsp;
of Hideko's aunt, who is eventually found hanging&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:36.640
from a tree in the yard, and so Lady Hideko&nbsp;
takes over as the reader for the auctions.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:41.760
He also plans to marry Lady Hideko when the&nbsp;
time has come to secure the inheritance money.

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:47.200
Count Fujiwara initially planned to execute&nbsp;
the scheme alone. He comes over to one of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:52.240
auctions and claims to be a Japanese nobleman&nbsp;
with a skill of art forgery, so Uncle Kouzuki&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:57.840
hires him to forge art for him. He also manages to&nbsp;
persuade Uncle Kouzuki to let him be the painting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:03.520
teacher for Lady Hideko. But after interacting&nbsp;
with Lady Hideko, he realizes that she is not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:07.840
naive and is stone-hearted. There would be&nbsp;
no way to get her to fall in love with him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:12.480
Instead of giving up, he reaches out&nbsp;
to Lady Hideko and tells her the truth,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:17.840
that he is not a Japanese nobleman and is trying&nbsp;
to seduce her for the inheritance. He proposes a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:22.800
plan to get her away from this abusive life of&nbsp;
hers. He will bring a naive girl who will come&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:26.720
in as a handmaiden and trick her into thinking&nbsp;
that she is the one who is doing the scam.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:31.520
Once they get married, Lady Hideko will switch&nbsp;
identities with the handmaiden and they will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:36.560
send the handmaiden to a mental asylum. This would&nbsp;
grant Lady Hideko her freedom at the cost of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:42.160
handmaiden’s life, then split the inheritance&nbsp;
money with Count Fujiwara. Lady Hideko agrees.

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:47.920
Since the arrival of Sok-hee at the mansion, Lady&nbsp;
Hideko is already acting to condition her state of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:52.960
mind into believing the bogus plan. She shows all&nbsp;
her clothes and jewelry to Sook-hee to make her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:58.640
more gullible. Fujiwara instructs Lady Hideko to&nbsp;
act naive but hesitates to fall in love with him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:02.880
This would ensure that Sook-hee is kept&nbsp;
busy with her task of playing cupid.

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:09.440
Unfortunately for Count Fujiwara, Lady Hideko and&nbsp;
Sook-hee get too close. They get attracted to each&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:14.800
other and end up making passionate love one night.&nbsp;
On the night when Lady Hideko is mad at Sok-hee,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:19.200
she tries to hang herself from the tree where&nbsp;
her aunt died because she is disappointed by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:23.680
Sok-hee’s response earlier. Sook-hee stops&nbsp;
her and confesses to her about the scheme&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:29.440
she does with Count Fujiwara. She also admits&nbsp;
to having fallen in love with her. Lady Hideko&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:34.080
then also admits to Sook-hee about being part of&nbsp;
a plan that involved sending Sook-hee to asylum.

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:40.240
They decide to take down Count Fujiwara and Uncle&nbsp;
Kouzuki. They start by destroying all of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:45.440
erotic art collection and play along with Count&nbsp;
Fujiwara’s plan. They act lovey-dovey secretly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:51.280
behind Count Fujiwara. And not to worry, Lady&nbsp;
Hideko doesn’t have sex with Count Fujiwara on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:55.680
their first night. It’s just fake blood to make&nbsp;
him believe that they are still trying to fool&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:55.680 --> 00:11:00.960
Sok-hee. Sook-hee only acts surprised and creates&nbsp;
a scene at the asylum to make it more believable.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:05.520
Later, she stages a fire at the asylum&nbsp;
and escapes in the heat of confusion.

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:12.320
Lady Hideko and Count Fujiwara head out for dinner&nbsp;
to celebrate. He proposes to her to marry him for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:18.160
real. But she plays hard to get and refuses.&nbsp;
At the hotel, she seduces him then drugs his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:22.720
wine with opium. When he’s knocked out, she&nbsp;
takes all the money and meets with Sok-hee.

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:28.800
In the end, Lady Hideko and Sok-hee fake their&nbsp;
identity and head out to Shanghai on a ship.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:31.840
On the ship, they are finally&nbsp;
able to express their love to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:33.680
each other freely in their newfound freedom.
