00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.720
Singing in the Rain is a musical
masterpiece filled with memorable songs

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:10.830
spectacular dance routines, a classic old
Hollywood setting: it's a film that many

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.420
would describe as a timeless classic and
I believe you should watch it as for why

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.279
that is let's look at two aspects of the
film the story and the spectacle of the

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.279
song and dance routines and with that
out of the way

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:27.800
This is Singing in the Rain

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.260
the movie is set in the 1910s, at the premiere of a

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.969
Don Lockwood and Lina Lamont film both
of whom are big-name movie stars though

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.100
it's Don that's the star of this film
before the premiere, we learn about Don's

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.210
humble beginnings from his childhood
growing up and working with his best

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:51.160
friend, Cosmo Brown, up until his
adulthood where he began to rise in fame

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:56.960
going from musician, to Vaudeville act, to
stuntman until he became the leading man

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.250
that he is today. After the premiere Don
and Cosmo head out to attend a party

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.340
hosted by RF Simpson, the producer of
Don's films, but on their way there they

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.810
have car trouble and run into a frenzy
of Don's fans who Don manages to escape

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.330
from after jumping into the car of Kathy
Selden a young and aspiring actress

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.009
hoping to make it big on stage who
freaks out when she sees dawn but when

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.390
she realizes who he is she makes it
clear what she thinks about Don's work

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.759
its overly dramatic, its lacking in life,
and what more it's not even "real acting"

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.350
which doesn't sit well with Don but
even with this disagreement she drops

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.329
him off at R.F.'s party and it's here
Don is shown a talking movie

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.820
–a technical marvel for the time
that many guests are skeptical of

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.560
after the showing a cake is wheeled out
and from it pops out

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:57.060
Kathy Selden! Who is not in fact an 
actress but is in fact a chorus girl

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.420
after her performance and some teasing from Don

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.630
about her high and mighty attitude
earlier, Kathy throws a cake in Don's

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:09.179
face but accidentally hits Lina instead!
Kathy immediately leaves the party with

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.340
Don in pursuit who has found himself
smitten with the young dancer and wants

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.209
to get to know her better but he doesn't
catch up to her in time

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:23.730
Three weeks later, Don meets Kathy at the
back lot of Monumental Pictures where

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:29.040
she admits that she's actually a big fan
of his and is promptly hired to work

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.550
with him and from here on out they'll
be working very closely together

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:39.480
but problems arise when the jazz singer, a talking movie or "talkie", becomes a

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.700
big hit at the box office so Don and Lina's
newest picture the Dueling Cavalier is

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:51.330
turned into a talkie but problems arise
on set due to the inexperience Don and Lina

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.720
have with talking films and well, Lina's
voice

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.740
[Speaking in a shrill voice]
"Pierre, you shouldn't have come!"

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:03.800
and things go from bad to worse as on
the night of the film's preview

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.780
more problems occur: the audio dubbing goes

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.880
out of sync and the performances are
seen as cheesy and undignified leading

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:19.310
to the first talkie of Don and Lina's
career, bombing before it's even released

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:25.500
after the embarrassing preview: Don, Cosmo,
and Cathy mull over the failure of the

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.180
film but the trio lift their spirits up
after some talking as they come up with

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.250
a plan to re-release the Dueling
Cavalier as a musical with Kathy

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:40.049
dubbing over Lina's physical performance
fixing the problem of Lina's voice and

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:43.560
of course taking advantage of
the latest trends

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.940
from there the trio work together to
transform a Dueling Cavalier

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.720
into a musical called "The Dancing Cavalier"

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:56.910
secretly recording lines and songs
without Lina's knowledge going so far as

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:01.799
to shoot new scenes and changing the
plot to feature a modern-day segment

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:07.440
but Lina finds out and not only is she
mad that Kathy will be dubbing over her

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.740
performance she's jealous of the
attention Don gives her (Kathy)

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:14.280
and being the jealous diva that she is

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:20.820
Lina blackmails and threatens to sue R.F.
 for this violation of her contract and

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:28.020
with little choice R.F. begrudgingly agrees
and wipes Kathy's credit from the film

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.780
at the premiere of "The Dancing Cavalier"

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:35.460
people love Lina and Don's performance
and after much applause and encore from

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.980
the audience, Don and Lina go backstage to be

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:43.200
congratulated by Kathy and Cosmo where
Lina reveals that Kathy is now

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:49.400
contractually obligated to dub over
Lina's performances for all future films

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:56.220
and then an argument erupts backstage
between Lina, The Trio, and R.F. but it's

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:01.440
interrupted when Lina is asked to
deliver a speech after which she's

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:07.680
requested to sing live in front of all
of these people but Don has a clever

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.810
plan which he shares with R.F. and Cosmo
and when Lina comes back for help dawn

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:18.030
forces Kathy to sing into a microphone
behind a curtain as Lina mouths along to

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:23.540
the song Kathy sings only for the curtain
to get pulled by Don, Cosmo, and R.F.

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:28.820
humiliating Lina as the crowd realizes
that it's Kathy doing the singing

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:34.290
embarrassed and stressed from the whole
ordeal Kathy tries to run away but is

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:38.580
stopped when Don gives credit where
credit is due and admits his love for

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:42.900
Kathy and the film and to the two of
them kissing in front of the billboard

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:47.400
for their newest film: Singing in the Rain

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:53.000
so the story of Singing in the Rain is simple:
It's cute, it's quaint, it's classic

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.900
an appealing and romantic love story that charmed the
critics and audiences who watched it

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:03.420
that fills those who watch it with this warm, fuzzy
feeling of nostalgia

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:08.360
but story is only part of the reason why
people remember Singing in the Rain

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:13.900
the other part is its music and
dances and to get what I mean

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:17.320
let's look at three of my favorite song and
dance routines:

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:23.180
Make 'Em Laugh, Broadway Melody, and Singing in the Rain

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:27.520
"Make 'Em Laugh" is such a fun and creative sequence:

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.640
the set up for this is that Don
is visiting the studio three weeks

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:35.180
after the party talking with Cosmo who
goes on a rant about actors and

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:40.610
entertainers leading to this song. This
whole sequence composed of multiple

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:45.800
long takes makes good use of "mise-en-scene",
with a dynamic floor routine that goes

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:50.120
up and down, left and right intermixed
with silly gags and funny moments

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:54.380
such as Cosmo trying to fix his nose
after running into a brick wall and the

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:58.970
memorable and goofy couch sequence with
Cosmo and a dummy–it's a fun whimsical

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:06.970
high-energy performance that I loved as
a child and I still do even to this day

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:11.810
"Broadway Melody" is one humdinger of a
sequence and arguably one the most

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:17.780
artistically impressive framed as a
diegetic movie it has impressive sets

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:22.900
and an internal storyline that features
Cyd Charisse as a guest dancer

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:27.220
who's got legs that go on for miles! Yowza!

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:31.320
the sequence is set in a fantastical and
stage-depiction of Broadway

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:38.980
with colorful clothes, moving sidewalks, and Don playing a young dancer hoping to make it big on Big Broadway

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:42.900
it is filled to the brim with bombastic
big-band music, group dance

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:47.910
numbers and solo floor routines and also
features a two minute long dance shared by

00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:52.350
Gene Kelly and Cyd Charisse who
throughout the dance exudes this

00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:57.840
intensely sultry seductive energy and
although the sequence is a bit jarring

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:01.580
with how its introduced the whole
sequence is an ode to Broadway musicals

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:09.170
and acts as a nice respite in art design
and creativity from the rest of the film

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:13.669
finally there is my favorite song and
dance sequence that the musical was

00:08:13.669 --> 00:08:18.320
named after Singing in the Rain,
featuring Don singing about how his

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:23.300
hopes are high, he's in love, and how he
feels like a million bucks! Nothing in

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:28.460
this moment can bring him down not even
the rain that he's singing and dancing

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:35.000
in and it's just fun to see Don cut loose
and enjoy himself as he plays around with

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.900
the street set and his umbrella with the
band swelling in parallel

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:44.420
with the peaking of his joy and spirit and there
are a lot of things I love about the

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:50.390
sequence, in particular are the many
memorable shots throughout it like Don

00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:55.550
hanging from the lamppost or leaning
against it and this particular moment

00:08:55.550 --> 00:09:01.250
where he's got this big, goofy grin on
his face that perfectly encapsulates the

00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:07.010
feelings I get when I watch this movie
there's this joy, this vigor, and this

00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:11.779
emotion to the song, to the dance, and to
the cinematography that I can't help but

00:09:11.779 --> 00:09:17.000
adore. Maybe it's the choreography, the
expression of Don's face, or the big-band

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.459
sound that plays throughout the whole
sequence whatever it is, it always makes

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:27.400
me grin and sing along with Don 
whenever I watch this sequence

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:33.540
and it really is the crowning jewel of this musical

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:36.980
and after talking about all these things

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:42.630
the unifying feature that to me makes
this film so memorable is nostalgia

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:47.920
because we see how film changes in
response to new technology, we see how

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:53.200
they've changed the way that they shoot
films and make movies and the film's

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:57.220
attention to detail in regards to these
aspects of filmmaking and the industry

00:09:57.220 --> 00:10:02.170
as a whole makes it a celebration of an
older time, a tribute to an era that

00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:05.480
would form the foundations of modern
film

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:08.640
Making Singing in the Rain into a time capsule

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:12.300
that lets you peek into the past
in addition to being a classic

00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:18.190
musical with great songs, choreography,
and characters and with that said if you

00:10:18.190 --> 00:10:22.089
like musicals, I suggest that you watch
this film at least ONCE in your life and

00:10:22.089 --> 00:10:24.640
if you don't like it you can tell me all
about it

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:28.510
in the comments down below with that
said thank you so much for watching

00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:31.230
