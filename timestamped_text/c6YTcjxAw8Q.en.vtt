00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.160
outside even though caitlyn was sweet and airy she&nbsp;
used to be the dalton twins number one customer&nbsp;&nbsp;

shoes drenched in their schoolmate's blood&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.160
investigators arrive at the scene&nbsp;
and gather caitlyn's remaining stuff&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.240
they conclude that she was not a bomber because&nbsp;
no weapons were found while at the location&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.160
the investigators find nothing but a bloodbath&nbsp;
they are surprised to see the whole classroom&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.720
covered with caitlyn's blood as they retrieve more&nbsp;
evidence after the unprecedented event mara and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.800
her classmates are brought to the police station&nbsp;
they are interrogated about the incident and asked&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.800
if they noticed anything suspicious beforehand&nbsp;
the student's clothes are confiscated while they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.600
shower and change into sweatsuits they gather&nbsp;
in a small room in silence until mara snickers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.360
the rest of the students shoot her judging looks&nbsp;
while the others talk about what happened several&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.520
conspiracies come up and mara tells them that it&nbsp;
might happen again this chilling thought sparks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.320
fear and controversy the police finally released&nbsp;
the kids so they could reunite with their family&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.240
mara's parents pick her up from the station&nbsp;
and embrace her feeling glad that she's safe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.040
the ride home is quiet she is not prepared to talk&nbsp;
about it at all her parents express their concern&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:54.240
thinking that it might be a shooter still she&nbsp;
dismisses the idea and excuses herself to her room&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.800
once settled she receives a text message from an&nbsp;
unknown number the text says he just wanted to say&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:04.080
that i've had a crush on you for two years mara is&nbsp;
uninterested but she replies anyway she exchanges&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.800
texts with her secret admirer which helps take&nbsp;
her mind off the dreadful event the following day&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.560
the school holds a memorial for caitlyn before&nbsp;
her funeral at the incident neighbors and friends&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.800
gathered a big goodbye for the last time caitlyn's&nbsp;
father sadly removes a sticker from their family&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.280
car the sight of it puts mara in a depressive&nbsp;
state so she turns to the dalton twins in chase&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.160
of a high tess is entirely against this idea&nbsp;
and tries her best to stop mara but to no avail&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.400
the twins recommend a substance which mara&nbsp;
purchases mara pours her purchase in a cup&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.000
and drinks it at the local diner while tessa&nbsp;
companies are just in case something happens&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.360
they talk about their lives and how they've been&nbsp;
best friends since elementary school and have been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.000
inseparable since then their ultimate life plan&nbsp;
is to purchase a beach house and grow all together&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.680
as they give a toast to caitlyn mara&nbsp;
drinks from the cup and starts to get fazed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:51.440
moments later dylan hovmayer their quiet classmate&nbsp;
who used to be a transferee approaches their table&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
mara and tess take time to decide whether or&nbsp;
not he could sit with them dylan eventually&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.520
takes a seat and the three of them talk about the&nbsp;
funeral and try to make light of the situation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.800
mara directly asks dylan why he came over she&nbsp;
instantly realizes that he is the unknown number&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.600
she has been exchanging messages with he confesses&nbsp;
that he has a crush on her mara gets excited and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.320
is caught off guard she asks him why he confessed&nbsp;
all of a sudden dylan tells her that the incident&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.840
reminded him that life's too short and he wants to&nbsp;
live while he can before it happens all over again&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.480
at this point mara feels like throwing up because&nbsp;
of what she drank she lets dylan accompany her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.960
to the bathroom after getting the substance&nbsp;
out of her system mara looks hazely at dylan&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.480
she initially laughs it off but he stays&nbsp;
with her throughout it dylan asks her to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.240
homecoming and mara thinks of why she should&nbsp;
say no but is too intoxicated to decide&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.680
during halloween students dress up in costumes of&nbsp;
characters of their choice mara and dylan meet up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.360
with each other that day she makes him tell&nbsp;
her the story of how he fell in love with her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.760
from the day he saw her dylan tells her all the&nbsp;
time she caught him with amazement in two years he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.640
only dared to approach her recently he recalls the&nbsp;
day of the caitlyn incident mara was bringing two&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.280
backpacks one of which belonged to caitlyn dylan&nbsp;
came to ask how she is and also recalled what she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.800
said at the station during a football game the two&nbsp;
sit together mar then tells him that she likes him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.880
in a matter of seconds one of the players&nbsp;
explodes everyone at the game rushes to the exit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:12.400
after seeing a bloody field as the two embraces&nbsp;
harry love who's a member of the varsity team is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.960
the new victim his name dominates the news as the&nbsp;
whole town trends with the phrase covington curse&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:21.760
another memorial is held for harry led by his&nbsp;
teammates at home mara receives news from her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.520
parents that school is cancelled indefinitely&nbsp;
uncertainty fills the whole town as the reason&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.400
behind the incidents is still to be known mara&nbsp;
waits for dylan outside her home he arrives in a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.240
rundown ice cream truck that he bought with his&nbsp;
savings they drive to a party hosted by one of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.880
their classmates as mara and dylan grow closer to&nbsp;
each other at the party they head outside and find&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.880
themselves alone together dylan jokes around to&nbsp;
ease the atmosphere and they throw their cups in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.440
the air and glee after an emotional conversation&nbsp;
and moments of sexual tension built up mara and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.840
dylan share their first kiss all of a sudden&nbsp;
people start running out of the house screaming&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.760
a horrible chill set in their bodies as they enter&nbsp;
the house and sees the blood in the living room&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:01.120
another student has exploded the following morning&nbsp;
mara and tess are summoned by agent carla rossetti&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.920
who interviews them about the explosions&nbsp;
her pragmatic beliefs help her theorize the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:10.080
possibility that one person may be behind all&nbsp;
of these explosions mara and tess are clueless&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.240
about what to tell her as they have no idea&nbsp;
what is happening after the meeting mara heads&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:18.080
to the dalton twins home to inform them that agent&nbsp;
rossetti thinks that illegal substances caused the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:22.800
explosions the twins dismiss her crazy remark&nbsp;
with a laugh mar then purchases all of their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:27.200
products as instructed by agent rossetti this is&nbsp;
to test your theory of illegal substances being&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:31.920
the culprit jenna and joe are delighted to have&nbsp;
their stock sold out with one purchase they grab&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:36.400
the keys to their car and head to their stash the&nbsp;
twins hide it in a secret place to keep it safe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:41.360
while driving joe explodes jenna looks at the&nbsp;
now empty driver's seat in complete disbelief&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:45.600
she and mara look at each other with reflected&nbsp;
emotions jenna tries to control the steering wheel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:49.760
but the blood-drenched car makes it almost&nbsp;
impossible she explodes a mere seconds later&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:53.600
and mara blacks out as the car crash by the&nbsp;
side of the road dylan arrives at the scene&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:57.040
of the accident and he rushes to find any&nbsp;
signs of mara but he gets hopeless after&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:01.600
seeing an empty car filled with blood he gets&nbsp;
up and sees a bloody handprint on a rock this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:06.000
gives him hope so he runs to the nearby river to&nbsp;
check on her she is cleaning herself when dylan&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.560
arrives at her rescue mara is shattered after&nbsp;
witnessing the literally bloody accident dylan&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:15.520
has extra clothes for her in a matter of seconds&nbsp;
men in hazmat suits arrive in the woods they take&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:20.640
both of them away to be quarantined in a medical&nbsp;
facility as mara gains consciousness dr ralonda&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:25.760
assures her that she will help her she tries&nbsp;
to lift herself up but her body is covered with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:30.320
tubes as she is examined mara sees dylan right&nbsp;
beside her in the same situation they both reach&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:34.400
for each other's hands in between the plastic&nbsp;
covers that night dylan confirms tomorrow that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:38.080
the doctors are indeed doing tests on them he&nbsp;
also tells her that the whole class is in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:42.400
same facility they move their beds closer to&nbsp;
each other and dylan romantically asks mara if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:47.520
she could be his girlfriend to which she says&nbsp;
yes the following day the series of tests begin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:51.200
the government is behind it to create a cure&nbsp;
that would keep their blood inside their bodies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:55.760
they have one by one sessions with dr ralanda who&nbsp;
interviews and monitors the class although they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:59.680
are locked up they are still provided comfort&nbsp;
they are even given a common room and time for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:05.040
recreational activities they talk about trying&nbsp;
to break out but harper one of their classmates&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:09.600
says that he is having a great time he adds that&nbsp;
in the tent they are assured that they are healthy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:13.520
a government official shows them a presentation&nbsp;
about the search for the cure mara questions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:17.360
their methods and is unconvinced about their way&nbsp;
of trying to help them the man gets taken aback&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:22.480
by their behavior harper backs mara's claims and&nbsp;
says that politicians are useless as they cheer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:27.440
harper explodes because of this the kids remain&nbsp;
at the facility while their families wait outside&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:31.040
in the middle of the night another of their&nbsp;
classmates explodes while sleeping and the doctor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:36.160
informs her parents hope is slowly fading at this&nbsp;
rate however the search for a cure must continue&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:41.040
endless medications and interviews are&nbsp;
undergone by the class as days go by more of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:45.840
them still explode as the medications prove to be&nbsp;
ineffective their days slowly look like a routine&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:50.080
by the time they think that the perfect medication&nbsp;
is formulated the kids are released home their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:55.760
families welcome them outside the tent on the way&nbsp;
home mara is ecstatic to say the least she notices&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:55.760 --> 00:08:00.000
that although christmas is around the corner&nbsp;
the streets do not look very lively she asks her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.160
parents why there are no decorations they reply&nbsp;
that the citizens do not feel festive because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:09.040
of the human explosions the three of them arrive&nbsp;
home and they surprise mara with a christmas tree&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:13.440
she gets delighted and excited as they add more&nbsp;
ornaments in their small living room she shares&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:17.440
a special moment with her parents while they&nbsp;
smoke they all continue to take the medication&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:21.760
prescribed to them on christmas day dylan comes&nbsp;
over to her place and they share an intimate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:26.880
moment together whenever they are together they&nbsp;
both feel safe as if the incidents did not happen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:31.360
school is resumed and mara is dreadful about the&nbsp;
idea tess motivates her to attend as things are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:35.680
going back to normal the kids are back to class&nbsp;
and their teacher assures them of their safety&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:39.920
the day since the last explosion is also recorded&nbsp;
on their whiteboard cole one of their classmates&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:44.320
wears protective gear his whole body is covered&nbsp;
with shields the rest of them look at him with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:49.440
confusion agent rosetti continues to monitor the&nbsp;
kids and their health she has temporarily set up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:53.280
an office in their school to check on them&nbsp;
closely according to her it is always better&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:58.320
to hope for the best and expect for the worst on&nbsp;
dylan's birthday mara surprises him she designs a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:02.560
barn with colorful lights and plays music in hopes&nbsp;
of bringing back dylan's childhood memories both&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:06.880
of them enjoy the music as they dance together&nbsp;
dr rolando visits them at school the following&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:10.720
day to inform the class that the medication also&nbsp;
known as the snooze button will be available over&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:15.680
the counter according to her the snooze button is&nbsp;
not the cure but just a treatment she asks for a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:19.760
volunteer to step forward as she demonstrates&nbsp;
how the medication works steve volunteers and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:25.120
goes in front of the room dr ralonda instructs&nbsp;
him to do movements out of nowhere steve explodes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:29.680
in a matter of seconds more kids explode inside&nbsp;
the room they stop for a moment and rush outside&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:34.720
to run as the stampede starts more of them&nbsp;
start popping leaving the whole premises bloody&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:39.120
mara and dylan run together as they make&nbsp;
their way out it is complete chaos coal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:43.520
grabs mara once dylan gets farther away from her&nbsp;
unfortunately the only thing that the protective&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:48.240
gear has done to coal was to keep his blood from&nbsp;
splattering mara finds her way out she is afraid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:52.560
to be alone but luckily dylan comes to her again&nbsp;
they feel ecstatic that they could escape but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:57.200
their celebration is cut short when dylan suddenly&nbsp;
explodes this leaves mara in a pit of sadness and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:02.240
blood as she makes her way home she could not even&nbsp;
speak or cry the sight of dylan being gone under&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:07.680
days go by and mara just locks herself at home she&nbsp;
could not bring herself to go outside and attend&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:12.320
dylan's funeral their spontaneous love story&nbsp;
has ended abruptly in the worst way possible&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:16.640
she spends her time watching dylan's old videos&nbsp;
and mixing cocktails she falls into a pit of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:20.960

is her fault that the explosions took place&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:22.160
