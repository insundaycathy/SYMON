00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.530
this, now let's get into our breakdown of
Bly Manor

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:32.789
The Haunting Of Bly Manor Series Recap
Ok so the Haunting Of Bly Manor is loosely

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:38.010
based on the book The Turn Of The Screw. This
psychological supernatural horror has been

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.339
the basis for a lot of ghost stories such
as The Innocents, The Haunting, The Others

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:46.909
and even The Turning which was released earlier
this year.

00:00:46.909 --> 00:00:52.190
Unlike the other adaptations though, Bly Manor
isnâ€™t so much a ghost story as it is a love

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.710
one.
The show carries the central theme of memory

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:00.399
as well as the past, and the series showcases
how several characters are haunted by theirs.

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:05.290
There's a real dichotomy here with us seeing
how some characters try to escape their past

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.140
whilst others won't let go of it.
If you've seen Flanagan's other work Doctor

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.100
Sleep you may remember in that there was a
line that stated memories are the real ghosts,

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.330
and though we do get our fair share of the
supernatural here, it definitely feels like

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.330
it dabbles in this motif.
We pick up at a wedding dinner rehearsal and

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:27.660
are introduced to Jamie, a woman who recounts
the story of her deceased lover Dani, an au

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:32.200
pair that worked at Bly Manor in the 80s.
Dani is haunted by the ghost of her ex-fiance,

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.860
who tragically died several years prior and
she moves out to the UK in order to get away

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.420
from this. Throughout the series it's revealed
that Dani is actually gay and when she came

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.180
out to her partner he ended up getting knocked
down.

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.860
His ghost has followed her since this moment
and she is desperate to escape him and her

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.930
past. Ultimately when one is trying to flee
from something they often are unable to because

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.290
the thing that they are trying to run away
from will inevitably become their driving

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:04.690
force and her inability to let go ends up
making her constantly live in fear.

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:08.479
This is reflected in several of the characters
that we meet throughout the season including

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.260
Henry Wingrave. A lot of the character arcs
in the show actually stem from Henry and he

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.130
oversees his brother's estate who sadly died
before the events of the show. It's revealed

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:23.440
that Henry had an affair with his sister inlaw
and that he is actually the father of Flora,

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.510
one of the children that lives at the manor.
Because of his guilt over this, Henry has

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.830
mentally manifested a darker version of himself
that he has to live with. Instead of facing

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.920
up to the fact that he should take responsibility
for both Flora and her brother Miles, he stays

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.540
in his office, ringing the manor in the hopes
that one day he will have the guts to tell

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.660
the truth.
There's also Peter Quint, what one could call

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:52.310
the villain of the show and in the prior adaptations
he was certainly portrayed this way. However,

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.500
Bly Manor paints him out in a much more complicated
light and we realise that he is not only trying

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.950
to escape the abuse that he suffered as a
child but he also refuses to let go of the

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:07.090
one good thing in his life. That is Rebecca,
the prior Au Pair at the Manor who ends up

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.870
falling in love with Peter.
After Peter is killed by one of the ghosts,

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.730
known as the lady of the lake, he manipulates
Rebecca into dying too because he refuses

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.130
to let go of her. Peter even takes Rebecca
to some of their happier moments in order

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.880
to make it seem like they will live like that
forever when in reality his inability to let

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.390
go of the past leads to them being trapped
in a living hell on the grounds.

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.220
It's said that Peter doesn't understand the
difference between love and Possession and

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.670
this becomes literal when he and Rebecca try
and take over the children's bodies in order

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.020
to escape the grounds.
Rebecca doesn't go through with this, and

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:45.540
she becomes one of the first characters to
truly break the cycle that so many of the

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.819
characters end up becoming victims to.
Next is Hannah, an almost Doctor Manhattan

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:54.720
esque character who can't accept her death
because of the reprecussions it would have

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.849
on her mentally. She lives moments of her
life almost simultaneously, jumping about

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:03.460
from the past to the future, living completely
out of sync and due to her inability to accept

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:08.650
the past in which she is truly unable to hold
on to any of the moments that she experiences.

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.550
Now it's revealed that the spirits within
the house are all sucked into a gravity well

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:16.989
of despair caused by the Lady of the lake.
We learn the lady of the lake was the prior

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.410
owner of Bly Manor and that she was killed
by her own sister who smothered her on her

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.010
death bed.
The lady known as Viola, wished to see her

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:29.830
daughter more than anything and this memory
tortured her ghost for decades ultimately

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.780
becoming her driving force in the end. Viola
would lie at the bed of the one located at

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:39.700
Bly Manor and every night she would wander
into the house, mercilessly murdering all

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:45.670
that crossed her path in search for her daughter.
I love how this was first set up in what became

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:50.419
pergatory for her and after waking up dead
she awakens, walks the room, returns to her

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:58.560
bed and then rinse and repeat.
This is also the reason why the children tell

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:05.320
Dani that she mustn't go about the house at
night as like clockwork, Viola roams the halls.

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:09.630
This idea of holding onto the past drives
her mad and the never ending search for her

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:14.120
daughter causes a lot of misery.
The Lady never finds her but she carries out

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:19.540
this routine in the hopes of one day coming
across her so that the two can be reunited.

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:21.783
After all the memories of her life fade away
and the lives of those she loved had vanished

00:05:21.783 --> 00:05:26.580
she still instinctively carried this out even
though she didn't know why.

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:33.770
Finally this is mirrored in Jamie who runs
a bath for Dani every night and leaves the

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:37.280
door unlocked in the hopes that one day the
two will meet again.

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:42.600
Those are the key players that we kinda have
to discuss in order to fully process the ending

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:47.570
and the events that happen in it. I don't
wanna do a full season recap as chances are

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:52.430
you've already watched it but just to add
some context the basic plot follows Dani as

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:57.979
she unearths the truth of the house including
the truth about Peter and Rebecca's death.

00:05:57.979 --> 00:06:02.950
As we mentioned Peter ends up possessing Miles
and Rebecca let's Flora go which allows Dani

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:07.810
to escape with her. However things hit the
fan when The Lady Of The Lake arrives and

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:11.759
she attempts to kill Dani and pull her into
her own well.

00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:17.199
However, Flora poses as her daughter and due
to her existing purely on instinct she attempts

00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:22.700
to take her back to the lake. Dani gives herself
up to the ghost uttering the phrase, it's

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:28.581
you, it's me, it's us. Something that had
existed in the house for centuries, passed

00:06:28.581 --> 00:06:34.500
on by the inhabitants and ghosts to the living
who then passed it on to the following occupiers.

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:39.410
Now though we don't get this confirmed, I
do believe that it Rebecca possessed her in

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:43.690
some manner in order to make her aware of
the words and thus she was able to invite

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:48.330
Viola's ghost into herself.
With the Lady's gravity of despair now withing

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:54.169
Dani, the spirits of the house are released.
The family and Dani and Jamie move to the

00:06:54.169 --> 00:06:59.449
US and the latter pair try and build a life
together, aware that one day Viola will take

00:06:59.449 --> 00:07:02.389
over.
Though gay marriage wasn't legal at the time

00:07:02.389 --> 00:07:06.780
the two decide to wear rings as a sign of
their commitment and they spend years with

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:10.590
each other.
However, Viola starts to appear in reflections,

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:15.880
much like how Dani's ex-fiance did. This time
it's much worse though as the ghost is in

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:21.110
place of her and thus the PTSD from her prior
haunting starts to make her doubt whether

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:26.020
she can remain in control of the situation.
One night Dani finds herself almost strangling

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:31.410
Jamie and she realises that they can't risk
the danger that Viola pooses. Thus she heads

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:36.840
back to the manor and drowns herself in the
lake. The routine of Viola over powers her

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:41.480
but Viola holds herself at the bottom of the
lake, waiting until the lady fades like all

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:45.229
memories do.
Jamie spends years waiting for her lover return

00:07:45.229 --> 00:07:50.750
and we realise that she has in fact been narrating
the events of bly to Flora and the guests

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:54.229
of her wedding.
We learn that both Miles and Flora slowly

00:07:54.229 --> 00:07:59.000
forgot the events of the manor and their memories
faded as they grew up. Because they were able

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.900
to let go of the past, primarily because of
their age, they were able to move on and build

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:08.940
lives for themselves. Memories work two fold
and though they can give you purpose, which

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:12.780
we saw demonstrated in some of the ghosts,
they can also hold you back.

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:17.110
Now the show has a very bittersweet ending
with us seeing that the characters have grown

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:22.030
older and moved on from the events of the
show, all except for Jamie who still holds

00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:26.590
out for the return of Dani.
Not gonna lie...that song at the end had me

00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:30.100
a bit...well there was some dust in the room
but you know.

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:34.419
The series ends with Jamie sitting in her
chair with the door open and we see Dani's

00:08:34.419 --> 00:08:38.770
hand touch her chair. She's still wearing
the wedding ring that the pair bought as a

00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:43.390
symbol of their love and finally she's returned
after escaping the lake.

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:47.790
Now how was this possible?
Well the main thing that was keeping the ghosts

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:53.670
on the grounds was Viola and her gravity well
that pulled all the spirits to the location.

00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:58.270
This is how they were unable to leave and
they remained on the property living so long

00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:02.230
their forgot their lives, identities and even
what they looked like.

00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:06.490
I believe that the same thing happened with
the Viola and with Dani holding her in place

00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:10.950
for decades she slowly started to forget everything
until there was a point in which she would

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:14.930
finally forget about her hold over Dani and
let go of her.

00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:19.250
As Dani was much younger than she was and
hadn't spent the centuries prior on the lakebed

00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:22.782
she still had memories of her life and the
fact that she would be able to one day return

00:09:22.782 --> 00:09:29.000
to Jamie if she held Viola in place gave her
purpose.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.610
Jamie's memories of their life together too
is what gave her purpose and though the show

00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:38.120
wrestles back and forth with letting go of
the past and holding onto it, I think when

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:42.720
it's a positive memory it very much carries
the message that one should hold onto it.

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:46.850
Nowhere is this more prevalent than in the
opening episode in which Owen practices his

00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:50.480
wedding speech.
He states that the worth of loving someone

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:54.940
is also worth the pain of losing them and
though we are all destined to leave behind

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:59.130
the ones that we love at some point, the memories
that we have of them are what we will truly

00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:03.560
hold onto.
It's very bitter sweet and just as flora has

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:08.120
a life ahead of her in which she will lose
the person she loves eventually, she's likely

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:11.310
going to create a lot of amazing memories
with her.

00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:15.940
That's the central theme of the show to me
at least and in the end Jamie is reunited

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:21.140
with the one that she loves much like how
Owen and Hannah will be, Peter and Rebecca

00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:25.120
were and Henry and his daughter are as they
dance at the latter's wedding.

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:30.940
It brings everything full circle and closes
out the season on a high note.

00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:36.230
Now before we get into the review I just wanna

00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:56.620
takes part.
Ok so The Haunting Of Hill House is actually

00:10:56.620 --> 00:11:01.899
my favourite Netflix show ever. I found that
it perfectly handled the themes of family,

00:11:01.899 --> 00:11:09.680
the horror elements and told the heart warming
story of hill house in the perfect way.

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:14.350
Naturally I was very hyped for this season
but I think that may have led to me being

00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:19.600
slightly disappointed in it. Though it has
some brilliant moments, on the whole I felt

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:24.450
that it slightly paled in comparison to the
prior entry. To me the characters just weren't

00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:29.260
as interesting as The Cranes and whereas that
had an episode that really gave light to each

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:36.140
character and got you swept up in their lives...here
I found it difficult to really find anything

00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:38.640
engaging.
I feel like there are so many elements remixed

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:44.160
here that don't quite capture the imagination
of the original. For example the twist with

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:48.390
Hannah is very similar to the bent neck lady
one, they go through the adults lives and

00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:57.290
then the kids have a character that's haunted
by his own vision of someone close to him.

00:11:57.290 --> 00:12:01.300
Even the background ghosts this time around
feel like they're just trying to recapture

00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:05.790
the original series and play on it's motifs
without truly pushing the boat out.

00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:11.769
Now it certainly isn't bad but the pacing
is slightly off and at 9 hours I do feel like

00:12:11.769 --> 00:12:16.290
there are several elements that could've been
cut here to provide a much brisker storyline.

00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:21.200
There's only so many times Dani can wander
around the house before it becomes repetitive

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:26.761
and though the background ghosts were fun
to spot, at points it felt as empty as the

00:12:26.761 --> 00:12:30.850
halls of the house itself.
Now saying that, it is brilliantly directed

00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:37.160
and acted too. Everyone here handles the material
really well and each character is memorable

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:42.200
however, the pacing just leaves things feeling
a bit off at times especially when this is

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:48.279
a story that has been adapted so many times
before. I think when we hit Viola's backstory

00:12:48.279 --> 00:12:53.430
things slow to a crawl and by the time we
return to the characters for the finale it

00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:58.279
feels a bit disjointed. We then spend a lot
of time out the house for the last hour and

00:12:58.279 --> 00:13:02.993
I dunno, kinda return of the kinged it a bit
for me.

00:13:02.993 --> 00:13:07.900
I still love you Flanagan I'm still hyped
to see what the director does next but for

00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:12.470
now, I dunno how I feel about this.
If I was gonna score the season I think I'd

00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:18.930
give it a 6/10 but who knows whether that
will improve or increase after a revisit.

00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:23.110
