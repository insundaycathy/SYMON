00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:06.749
The Platform is a movie about a vertical self-management
center, which is a fancy way of saying a prison

00:00:06.749 --> 00:00:08.330
in the shape of a tower.

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.320
It’s not exactly a prison though, we’ll
come back to that.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:18.470
Prisoners, I mean residents, are placed two
per level, for 333 levels.

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:23.550
At the core of the plot lies the platform,
which is loaded with a king’s feast worth

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:31.349
of food every day, enough to keep all 333
levels alive if rationed appropriately.

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:37.300
The platform is then sent down through a hole
in the center of the tower to the peasants,

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.860
level by level, top to bottom.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.739
Every month the residents are randomly placed
on a different level.

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.180
You could be at the top 1 month, the bottom
the next month, or on the bottom 3 months

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:50.230
in a row.

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:56.000
As you can imagine, people at the top are
respectful and humble and ration food for

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.310
those below them, and those on the lower level
are grateful and respectful to those below

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:03.010
them as well.

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.680
Everyone on all levels only takes what they
need and are able to get enough calories and

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.380
protein to survive for that month as well
as enjoy a respectable morsel of dessert foods.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:21.540
Just kidding, The VSC is a sadistic hellhole
that extracts and emphasizes the worst aspects

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.170
and temptations of human behavior.

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.350
People who find themselves at the top give
little crap for those below them, or a lot

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:30.460
in some cases..

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:35.650
They greedily consume as much as their bellies
can hold, and leave no food or dignity for

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:40.810
those below them, causing either suicide,
starvation, or cannabalism.

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.480
Why should they care for those below them,
as the lower class has no recourse (can’t

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:46.500
crap upwards).

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:57.290
And when the people on the top levels had
been on the lower levels, nobody spared them,

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.780
so why should they spare those who didn’t
spare them?

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.000
It’s a vicious cycle derived from the VSC’s
rules.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.460
If you woke up tomorrow on floor 48 of the
tower of terror(?), what would you do, what

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:10.750
could you do?

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:17.530
In this video on Nerd Explains, I'll tell
you, 6 ways to beat The Platform.

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.290
First, what are the VSC’s rules:

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:21.290
1.

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:27.020
You can bring one item into the VSC, it could
be a knife, book, gun, rope, anything that

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:32.800
could fit into a carry-on luggage bag, there’s
no TSA checkpoint before entering the Vertical

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.390
Self-Management Center.

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:35.390
2.

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.770
You are randomly assigned to a floor level.

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.640
At the end of each month the administration
gasses you and you wake up at a new random

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:43.640
level.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:44.640
3.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.660
You are randomly assigned cell mates, and
unless your cellmate perishes, you stick with

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.060
them when moving floors.

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.060
4.

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.490
If your cellmate perishes, you won’t get
a new one until the start of the next month.

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:57.490
5.

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:01.300
Food is served once per day on a table-sized
concrete platform.

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.310
It theoretically carries enough food for most
levels if rationed correctly.

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:06.310
6.

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:11.420
If you try to hold or store any food after
the platform moves to the next level, the

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:17.330
administration will crank the thermostat knob
in either direction, either freezing you or

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:18.330
incinerating you.

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:19.330
7.

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.150
You can ride the platform down without consequence.

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:23.920
But we’re unsure about the ride up.

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:24.920
8.

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:30.930
Once the platform reaches the bottom, under
level 333, it rockets back to the top.

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:36.260
It would be a bad idea to try to catch a ride
on it as it’s going up.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.130
9.

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:45.959
Besides all the above rules, pretty much anything
goes, including murder and cannabilization.

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:49.790
This is why you need to read the fine print
before signing up for things.

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.680
Okay so how do we beat this:

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:52.680
1.

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:53.680
Kill everyone else.

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.410
If everybody’s dead there can’t be a food
shortage.

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:01.660
Depending on how sociopathic you are, or how
long your sentence is.

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.430
This could be either your first or last option.

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:20.580
Actually, this is kind of what ended up happening
when Goreng and Baharat tried to enforce rationing.

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:25.630
When lunch time comes, hop on and ride the
platform down with sharpened pieces of bed

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:26.630
frame.

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:29.530
Every level you can go down, you’ll have
to eliminate two people.

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:36.580
Now here’s the deal, riding the platform
up is risky, as you don’t know if the platform

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.440
tops out at the tower ceiling turning you
into a pancake.

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.900
I’d avoid riding up for now.

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:50.810
So if you started at level 5, and killed everyone
from 5 down to 333 where you currently reside

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:55.000
for the month, you’ll still get the same
food as you would’ve on level 5.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.180
Not much of an improvement.

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:58.180
But.

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:02.970
The next month if you find yourself on level
200, there will be a lot less people above

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.680
you eating the food, so you won’t starve.

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:11.331
Now if the VSC has a large backlog of applicants,
this will throw a giant wrench in the plan.

00:05:11.331 --> 00:05:12.331
Imagine riding down the tower killing hundreds
of people, then relaxing on level 333 for

00:05:12.331 --> 00:05:13.331
the rest of the month knowing that next month
if you’re on a bad level you’ll still

00:05:13.331 --> 00:05:14.331
get all the food.

00:05:14.331 --> 00:05:15.331
Then the next month you wake up on level 300,
normally you’d freak out because you’ll

00:05:15.331 --> 00:05:16.331
get no food, but not this time.

00:05:16.331 --> 00:05:17.331
You killed everyone else.

00:05:17.331 --> 00:05:18.331
I’m sure they refilled some levels with
people as they normally do.

00:05:18.331 --> 00:05:19.331
Lunchtime comes and you’re rubbing your
hands together and licking your lips, waiting

00:05:19.331 --> 00:05:20.331
for that giant feast.

00:05:20.331 --> 00:05:21.331
You hear the buzz and see the platform come
down.

00:05:21.331 --> 00:05:22.331
Wait, what the fuck, where’s all the food.

00:05:22.331 --> 00:05:23.331
I killed everyone, they couldn’t have refilled
hundreds of positions the next month.

00:05:23.331 --> 00:05:24.331
I killed all those people for nothing.

00:05:24.331 --> 00:05:25.331
No!

00:05:25.331 --> 00:05:26.331
2.

00:05:26.331 --> 00:05:27.331
Wait it out.

00:05:27.331 --> 00:05:28.331
If you only have a few months in the hole
and you have some extra body fat, the probability

00:05:28.331 --> 00:05:29.331
of surviving and getting out is okay.

00:05:29.331 --> 00:05:30.331
Trying to buck the system will probably end
in your death.

00:05:30.331 --> 00:05:31.331
That said, the longer your sentence, the chances
of death becomes extremely high.

00:05:31.331 --> 00:05:33.570
In the movie it seems like the platform only
stays for a few minutes before moving on,

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:37.800
so all the calorie dense foods are going to
be gone quickly as people will be rushing

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:42.690
to stuff their face and get as many calories
in as possible before the platform moves.

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:48.810
If you are placed on floor 111 or lower you
get almost no food.

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:53.620
You effectively have only about a 30 percent
chance of being placed on a level that gives

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.740
you enough food to survive.

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:01.020
We know Goreng volunteered for six months
in exchange for a diploma, and Trimagasi had

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:02.750
a one year sentence.

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:06.450
If you have 6 months, that means six chances.

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:11.990
The average male weighs 190 at 5 foot 9 at
20 percent body fat.

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:15.820
Essential levels of body fat to survive is
around 5%.

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:21.620
That means the average person has about 25
pounds of fat, or about 90,000 calories they

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:23.740
can live off of without food.

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:28.660
Considering that same male will burn around
2000 calories every day just sitting around

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:29.990
in their cell.

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:33.810
This gives your average male 45 days without
food.

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:40.680
This means that if you are placed on level
111 or lower once you could survive, but twice

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.430
and you will starve.

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:52.110
So 6 coin tosses, we need 5 tosses to land
level 111 or above, as 2 tosses below 111

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:53.110
and we are dead.

00:06:53.110 --> 00:07:01.260
The chances of us being placed above floor
111 for 5 out of 6 months is 1.09%.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:05.070
Looks like solution number 1 isn’t so crazy.

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:11.030
In Trimagasi’s case, he had some extra weight,
so let’s say he could survive 3 months without

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:12.030
food.

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:17.260
He had a 12 month sentence so he’d need
9 months above level 111.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:25.170
His chances of survival is .17 %. I’d say
he should get some lotto tickets after he

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:30.300
gets out, but that’s a hot hand fallacy,
oh and also he was stabbed to death.

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:31.300
3.

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:32.300
Ride the platform up.

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:37.820
If you are too weak, old, or sick to perform
solution number one, and your sentence is

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:44.280
longer than 3 months so solution number 2
is out, then take the risk of being pancaked

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:47.250
and ride the platform down then back up.

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:51.509
You could be murdered on the way down, but
you don’t have many options here.

00:07:51.509 --> 00:07:52.509
4.

00:07:52.509 --> 00:07:57.070
Don’t volunteer to do 6 months in a place
that you know is called the hole.

00:07:57.070 --> 00:08:01.850
There are references in the movie from characters
having some knowledge about this facility,

00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:03.170
and what it’s called.

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:06.850
Baharat brought rope indicating he knew the
layout to some degree.

00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:12.100
Others brought guns and swords indicating
they knew it was a dangerous place to be.

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:16.750
If you didn’t know much or couldn’t verify
the conditions you’d be placed in, that

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:18.550
is a bad sign.

00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:21.890
If you know it’s called the hole, don’t
volunteer.

00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:23.830
Your diploma is not worth it.

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:24.830
5.

00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:29.460
If you generally knew what the hole was and
were stupid enough to sign up anyways or you

00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:33.800
were sentenced, what could you bring to help
you survive your sentence.

00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:37.309
Well a weapon would help with solution number
1.

00:08:37.309 --> 00:08:41.419
Considering you’d potentially need to kill
hundreds of people, you’d probably want

00:08:41.419 --> 00:08:45.350
to pick a reusable weapon like a sword instead
of a firearm.

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:47.339
Unless you could carry a bunch of ammo.

00:08:47.339 --> 00:08:54.269
If you could carry a .22 pistol with a brick
of 500-1000 rounds which isn’t that large,

00:08:54.269 --> 00:08:57.869
you could eliminate everyone in the VSC multiple
times over.

00:08:57.869 --> 00:09:02.990
Food could help with solution number 2 depending
on how much you could bring, though you wouldn’t

00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:07.610
be able to bring enough food in a carry-on
to help you survive more than an extra month.

00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:12.499
In a six month sentence, an extra month of
food would raise your chances of survival

00:09:12.499 --> 00:09:15.100
from 1.09 % to 7.05%.

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:22.130
Ropes, grappling hooks, extendable ladders,
etc., are all dependent on the people above

00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:25.110
you to work, which makes them ineffective.

00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:28.839
To be honest, I can’t think of much you
could bring in a carry-on that would help

00:09:28.839 --> 00:09:29.839
much.

00:09:29.839 --> 00:09:31.870
Let me know in the comments if you have any
ideas!

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:32.870
6.

00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:33.870
Climb up.

00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:38.949
But how, the chances that multiple levels
of people would help you up is insane.

00:09:38.949 --> 00:09:40.569
Here is a possible idea.

00:09:40.569 --> 00:09:46.230
Fashion a rope out of the bed sheets and clothes,
and tie a huge knot at the end.

00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:51.170
Once the platform is about to stop at the
level above you, throw the rope up.

00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:54.220
It will get wedged at the top by the platform.

00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:58.759
The people above will be too preoccupied eating
as much as they can to notice.

00:09:58.759 --> 00:10:01.389
Then climb up the rope with a weapon.

00:10:01.389 --> 00:10:06.439
Once the platform starts to lower, quickly
climb on top of the platform and then jump

00:10:06.439 --> 00:10:07.439
to the level above you.

00:10:07.439 --> 00:10:08.439
If you have a trustworthy cellmate like Baharat
this would help.

00:10:08.439 --> 00:10:12.939
Kill those above as they will probably be
mad they have to share food with you and will

00:10:12.939 --> 00:10:14.920
sabotage your strategy like crabs in a bucket.

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:17.519
Rinse and repeat for every floor above you.

00:10:17.519 --> 00:10:22.250
You do have to be within 30 floors of the
top, because the platform only comes down

00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:28.209
once per day, and you have 30 days before
being randomly assigned to a new floor.

00:10:28.209 --> 00:10:34.110
If you make it to the top and they gas and
place you back in the hole, revisit solution
