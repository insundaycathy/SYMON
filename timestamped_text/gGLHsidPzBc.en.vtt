00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.400
Story Recapped here. Today,&nbsp;
I'm going to explain an action,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:09.200
sci-fi film called, "Upgrade." Spoilers&nbsp;
ahead! Watch out and take care.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.080
A mechanic, Grey Trace, fixes up a car&nbsp;
engine in his garage. After confirming&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.760
that the engine is running, he grabs&nbsp;
a beer and waits for his wife, Asha.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.520
Her self-driving car pulls up the&nbsp;
driveway. Asha's happy to see her husband.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.760
Entering their home, they are welcomed&nbsp;
by their A.I. Grey announced that he's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.200
finished his project and asks her to&nbsp;
help him deliver the car to his client,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.760
pointing out that he will get lost if he attempts&nbsp;
to use her self-driving car on the way back.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.280
Asha denies but gets interested when&nbsp;
Grey boasts about his client's home.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.560
The couple drives into a remote location&nbsp;
near the ocean. They walk between two stone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:51.040
columns where the hidden path to the house&nbsp;
is. Asha is impressed by its modern design.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.320
There, they meet Grey's client, Eron Keen,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:01.440
a renowned tech innovator. Asha is excited to meet&nbsp;
him, sharing that she works with Cobot, a tech&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.120
industry specializing in robotic limbs. Eron shows&nbsp;
them his latest work, a neural chip called STEM.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.840
But Grey is unimpressed, believing that humans&nbsp;
are still better than artificial intelligence.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.280
On their way back home, Asha and Grey become&nbsp;
intimate while the self-driving car takes them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:23.120
home. But Grey notices that the car has taken a&nbsp;
different route. Asha tries to redirect the car,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:28.720
but the system malfunctions. The car starts&nbsp;
driving recklessly. Grey pushes Asha back,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.840
strapping her on a seatbelt just&nbsp;
before the car crashes and turns.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.440
People outside witness the&nbsp;
accident, but they do not approach.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.840
The A.I. announces that it has&nbsp;
contacted emergency services to help.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:45.360
Four men approach the car, dragging them&nbsp;
both out. Above, a police drone records the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.760
events. Grey is held down while one of the men&nbsp;
threatens Asha and shoots her in the stomach.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.840
Then, they shoot Grey on the back&nbsp;
of his neck, leaving him paralyzed.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.440
Grey tries to encourage his wife, hoping to keep&nbsp;
her conscious. But Asha takes her last breath.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.360
Three months later, Grey returns home in a&nbsp;
wheelchair. The men had severed his spinal cord,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.600
leaving him a quadriplegic. New upgrades&nbsp;
have been installed in his house to help him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:16.400
while his mother, Pamela, often visits to care for&nbsp;
him. Grey breaks down, traumatized and grieving.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.840
At the police station, they meet Detective Cortez,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:25.520
who's assigned to investigate the event. But they&nbsp;
still haven't found the men who jumped on them.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.400
His condition and inability to help&nbsp;
get justice sinks Grey into depression.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.880
He attempts an overdose that&nbsp;
puts him back in the hospital.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.320
There, Eron offers a STEM implant that&nbsp;
would reconnect his spinal cord to his body.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.360
Grey refuses, wanting his life to be over instead.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.400
Eron asks him what Asha would've wanted before&nbsp;
leaving. The thought makes Grey reconsider.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.840
In Eron's home, Grey undergoes surgery&nbsp;
to install STEM into his spine.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.440
After the surgery, he goes through physical&nbsp;
therapy. Here, Grey moves his hand for the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:01.280
first time in months. Soon after, he's able to&nbsp;
walk and stand. The STEM operation is successful.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.400
Grey signs a confidentiality agreement,&nbsp;
preventing him from letting anyone else know.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.680
He continues his therapy in Eron's home, assured&nbsp;
that he is still in control of his body, not STEM.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.480
Back in his home, he enters on a wheelchair&nbsp;
but stands up once the door is closed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.800
He receives a package of evidence&nbsp;
and reports left by Cortez.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.360
He looks through the files and&nbsp;
watches the footage of the incident.

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:29.280
Suddenly, he hears a voice. Grey thinks it's&nbsp;
an intruder, but STEM introduces itself.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.000
STEM assures him that he hasn't gone insane,&nbsp;
telling him that the chip is merely sending&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.480
sound waves to his eardrum to communicate.&nbsp;
STEM directs his attention to the footage,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.360
pointing out that the man who&nbsp;
fired at Asha is not holding a gun.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.840
STEM also noticed that one of the&nbsp;
other men has a tattoo on his wrist.

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.800
With Grey's permission, STEM controls his&nbsp;
hand to recreate the tattoo. Grey recognizes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:55.440
that it's a military tattoo, and STEM uses the&nbsp;
numbers to access information about the man.

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.840
Filled with sudden hope, Grey calls&nbsp;
Cortez to give her the information,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.840
but STEM reminds him that he signed the&nbsp;
confidentiality agreement; thus, he cannot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.640
reveal how he got the information. STEM suggests&nbsp;
for him to find physical evidence instead.

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:14.640
From STEM's information, Grey finds the&nbsp;
suspect's apartment and breaks in. Inside,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:19.520
STEM instructs him to check the computer on the&nbsp;
coffee table. He searches through the messages but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:24.640
finds no useful information other than the local&nbsp;
bar, Old Bones, being mentioned several times.

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.480
While he's searching the house, a car pulls up,&nbsp;
and someone enters. STEM directs Grey to hide&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:36.320
and attack the man, Serk. But Grey hesitates.&nbsp;
Serk overpowers him and pins him to the wall,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:42.000
where he recognizes Grey. Grey tries to fight him&nbsp;
but is defeated. STEM asks permission to help,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.280
and Grey accepts. Under STEM's control, Grey&nbsp;
gets the advantage over the fight. After Serk&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:52.080
pulls out a knife, Grey asks STEM to stop&nbsp;
him. STEM takes the knife and kills Serk.

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.760
In shock, Grey vomits in the sink. STEM&nbsp;
advises him to clean up any trace of his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.920
presence in the house, but Grey is still&nbsp;
in shock at what he had done. Nervous,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:06.640
he asks STEM what he needs to do. STEM has&nbsp;
recorded everything he touched in the house,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.960
making it easier for them&nbsp;
to erase his fingerprints.

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:13.120
Hours later, Cortez investigates Serk's autopsy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.840
The coroner found numerous implants in the&nbsp;
body, including a gun implant on his arm.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.480
They also found engine grease&nbsp;
from the front porch of his house.

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:26.080
At Eron's home, Eron informs Grey that he can&nbsp;
track him through STEM. Eron scolds him that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:31.120
their operation should remain a secret, and his&nbsp;
investigation might expose them. Grey retaliates&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:36.000
that Eron kept STEM's ability to communicate&nbsp;
with him a secret. Eron is dumbfounded at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.040
news. Eron insists that Grey shouldn't risk any&nbsp;
activity that could put him and STEM in danger.

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:45.840
Meanwhile, Cortez continues the&nbsp;
investigation on Serk. She finds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:50.160
drone footage showing Grey in his wheelchair&nbsp;
near Serk's house before the crime happened.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.160
But the system disregards Grey as a&nbsp;
suspect, given that he's a quadriplegic.

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:59.920
Unsatisfied, Cortez visits Grey. She&nbsp;
talks to him about his car, but STEM&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:03.840
notices that she checked his boots, alerting&nbsp;
them that they left a print on Serk's house.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.720
Cortez brings up Serk's passing and seeing the&nbsp;
footage of Grey being in the area at the time it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:13.440
happened. Grey lies that he was trying to help the&nbsp;
investigation, but he couldn't have done anything.

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:18.160
Once she leaves, Grey tells STEM that he&nbsp;
wants to find the people responsible for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:22.720
Asha's assassination, but he doesn't want&nbsp;
to hurt anyone. STEM suggests going to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:26.800
Old Bones but reminds Grey that Eron will&nbsp;
track him there and shut STEM down remotely.

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:32.240
Despite this, Grey visits the Old Bones bar.&nbsp;
Grey calls out to the people at the bar.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:36.320
He asks about Serk but gets&nbsp;
laughed at. A man named Tolan&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:42.240
walks up to him and removes his earpiece. Grey&nbsp;
admits that he's the one who took Serk's life,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:47.360
angering Tolan. Tolan takes him to the&nbsp;
bathroom, bringing other men with them. Tolan&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:52.640
starts stabbing him to check if he feels anything,&nbsp;
ignoring Grey's questions. Grey gets his attention&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:57.040
by pointing out the gun implant. Tolan finally&nbsp;
admits to being there during the car crash.

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:01.760
With STEM in control, Grey fights&nbsp;
the men, knocking down the others.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:07.280
Grey pins Tolan down and interrogates him, but he&nbsp;
resists. Grey threatens him with a knife but can't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:11.760
bring himself to hurt the man. He gives STEM&nbsp;
permission to do it, with Grey looking away.

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:16.880
After a while, Grey tells STEM to stop and&nbsp;
recoils at the sight of what it has done.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:19.920
Tolan finally tells him&nbsp;
that the incident was a job.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:25.440
He gives him the name Fisk, but Tolan dies&nbsp;
before he can tell more. From Tolan's injury,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:30.320
Grey sees a computer chip branded COBOT,&nbsp;
the company where Asha used to work in.

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:34.800
Before he could let the information sink in,&nbsp;
STEM informs him that Eron is attempting to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:39.520
shut it down remotely. STEM instructs Grey&nbsp;
to visit a hacker nearby to disable Eron's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:43.840
remote control on it. Grey arms himself&nbsp;
as STEM instructs before leaving the bar.

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:47.200
In a hurry, Grey leaves his&nbsp;
wheelchair behind and runs.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:53.440
As he nears the location, STEM gives Grey a code&nbsp;
to disable Eron's access. Grey begins to lose&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:58.240
control of his limbs due to STEM shutting down. He&nbsp;
hurriedly crawls up the stairs to the apartment.

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:02.480
Back at the bar, Fisk, the&nbsp;
man who ended Asha's life,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:07.680
accesses Tolan's memory through his implants.&nbsp;
He gets Grey's next location. Fisk questions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:12.000
why the bartender didn't intervene in the&nbsp;
fight, sneezing in his face. His sneeze&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.920
delivers thousands of nanobots that the&nbsp;
bartender inhales, ending the man's life.

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:20.320
Grey finally reaches the hacker's apartment&nbsp;
just as STEM completely shuts down.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:24.960
The hacker, Jamie, pulls him inside&nbsp;
the room full of people playing VR.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:28.960
She works on the code, but Fisk and&nbsp;
his bodyguard arrive in the building.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:34.000
Jamie finishes the code and tells Grey to&nbsp;
wait for the reboot. An alarm triggers,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.720
alerting Jamie that Fisk and the bodyguard&nbsp;
are near. She packs up and leaves Grey behind.

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:43.600
Outside, Eron's security team&nbsp;
arrives as well to collect Grey.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:48.240
Unable to move, Grey panics. He&nbsp;
begins to gain control of one arm,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:53.840
which he uses to crawl. He stops, seeing a&nbsp;
vision of Asha, just before Fisk enters the room.

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:58.960
STEM fully reboots, allowing Grey to&nbsp;
escape the two men. Fisk's bodyguard&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:02.240
chases him while Fisk dispatches&nbsp;
the security team from the elevator.

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:06.800
Grey climbs up the fire escape,&nbsp;
but the rooftop has no escape.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:10.960
STEM takes control, successfully using&nbsp;
the bodyguard's implant against himself.

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:14.480
Fisk finds the body, but Grey is no longer there.

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:18.320
Grey returns home, surprised to see Pamela there.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:21.840
Pamela asks about the operation, but Grey&nbsp;
insists that no one else should know.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:26.560
Pamela is joyful that her son can walk&nbsp;
again, but this doesn't comfort Grey at all.

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:31.760
In his home, Eron looks mournful and&nbsp;
afraid. He has lost access to STEM.

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:37.120
Grey dreams about Asha sitting next to his&nbsp;
bed. Cortez arrives, telling him that they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:41.440
found his wheelchair near the Old Bones. Grey&nbsp;
claims that he followed someone there but got&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:46.400
into a fight with the person. Luckily, he was&nbsp;
helped out by strangers, who put him in a cab.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:49.840
During his story, Cortez&nbsp;
slips her hand in Grey's coat.

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:54.160
Grey admits that he wants to find&nbsp;
the men responsible for Asha's death.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:58.640
Cortez reminds him that it's easy to find&nbsp;
someone else to do it for him. Grey dares&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:03.840
her to scan his phone records to check. When&nbsp;
Grey becomes emotional, Cortez and Pamela leave.

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:10.000
Confused, Grey argues to STEM that they need to&nbsp;
stop. STEM shuts its functions off, disabling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.200
Grey. STEM reveals that the code he gave the&nbsp;
hacker gave it full autonomy, no longer requiring&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:20.240
Grey's permission to act on its own. STEM insists&nbsp;
on finding Fisk before he eliminates them.

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:25.600
STEM takes control of Grey, arming&nbsp;
him. Pamela sees him getting ready.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:28.800
Worried, she asks him what he's&nbsp;
done, but Grey doesn't respond.

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:33.120
Listening from the transmitter in&nbsp;
his coat, Cortez is in her car,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:37.680
taking notes. She hears Pamela say that Grey&nbsp;
came home, covered in blood and that he's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:42.320
currently armed. Cortez watches Grey drive&nbsp;
out from his garage, and she follows him.

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:45.840
While driving, Grey finds the&nbsp;
listening device in his pocket.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:51.040
STEM missed it due to it being an analog&nbsp;
device. Grey throws the device out in the road.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:54.560
Cortez turns her police siren on, pursuing Grey.

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:59.680
Hoping to lose her, Grey begins maneuvering&nbsp;
around cars. But Cortez keeps up.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:02.800
Grey pushes another car onto&nbsp;
hers, causing her to slow down.

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:08.160
Seeing that they can't outrun her, STEM accesses&nbsp;
a self-driving car, causing it to crash onto&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:13.840
Cortez's. Having lost Grey, she goes back to&nbsp;
his home and interrogates a weeping Pamela.

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:18.880
Grey finds Fisk in his home, holding him&nbsp;
at gunpoint. Fisk recounts that he was a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:24.080
soldier who was injured in battle. After,&nbsp;
he was used as a lab experiment in Cobot.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:28.720
Fisk argues that his actions gave Grey an&nbsp;
upgrade in life, becoming stronger than most.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:32.880
He offers Grey a position with his team.&nbsp;
But Grey insists on knowing the truth.

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:38.720
Fisk reveals that their job wasn't about Cobot,&nbsp;
that it was to sever Grey's spine intentionally.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:40.000
Asha was just collateral.

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:42.560
Angered, Grey fires his gun.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:47.760
Fisk evades and disarms him. The two men&nbsp;
fight, seemingly equal with their upgrades.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:53.840
STEM alerts Grey about Fisk's nanobots, stopping&nbsp;
him before he releases them. STEM is confused at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:59.040
how Fisk predicts his moves. Fisk finally has Grey&nbsp;
pinned to the wall, aiming his armed hand at him.

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:04.240
STEM is at a loss with its position.&nbsp;
Grey comes up with an idea, realizing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:09.120
that Fisk is Serk's brother. Grey taunts&nbsp;
him by insulting his brother. Angered,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:12.960
Fisk punches him instead, allowing Grey&nbsp;
to get the upper hand and eliminate him.

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:18.480
Grey is troubled at what he's done. STEM urges&nbsp;
him to continue finding the person who hired them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:22.880
Listening to a phone recording, they&nbsp;
hear Eron's voice warning Fisk about him.

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:29.280
Grey arrives at Eron's house, easily eliminating&nbsp;
his security team. A disheveled Eron waits for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:35.600
him. Grey accuses him of orchestrating everything,&nbsp;
which Eron denies. Cortez arrives, holding Grey at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:40.560
gunpoint. Grey convinces STEM to throw away&nbsp;
their gun as Cortez ordered. She orders him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:47.360
to lie on the floor to handcuff him. Instead, STEM&nbsp;
throws her off. Grey begs STEM not to hurt Cortez.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:50.800
He fights STEM's control despite STEM's&nbsp;
warnings that it will break his mind.

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:55.520
Holding Cortez by the neck, Grey&nbsp;
begs her to use the taser on him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:58.480
She does so, temporarily&nbsp;
causing STEM to malfunction.

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:03.520
Eron points the gun at Grey, revealing that&nbsp;
he's been controlled by STEM the entire time.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:07.840
STEM was the one who chose Grey to be&nbsp;
his host and led Grey to kill Eron,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:12.480
eliminating the only person who could create&nbsp;
another STEM. In the process of rebooting,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:17.280
STEM confesses to Grey that it chose him for&nbsp;
being a human without any artificial implants.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:21.360
Grey mourns, realizing that he's been&nbsp;
manipulated by the same thing that took his wife.

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:26.720
STEM begins to talk via the house's A.I.&nbsp;
system. He commands Eron to put the gun&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:31.760
down. But STEM is finally able to control&nbsp;
Grey again, forcing him to eliminate Eron.

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:34.400
When STEM attempts to shoot Cortez,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:40.160
Grey fights back again. He forces his hand to aim&nbsp;
the gun at his neck instead. He pulls the trigger.

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:46.560
Grey wakes up in a hospital, still able to move&nbsp;
his limbs. Scared, he calls for STEM, but it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:52.480
doesn't answer. Instead, Asha walks in, alive&nbsp;
and happy to see him. She tells him that he's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:57.920
been unconscious for two days after an accident.&nbsp;
In disbelief, Grey tearfully stares at his wife.

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:02.960
Back in Eron's house, STEM has taken&nbsp;
complete control of Grey's body.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:06.160
Grey's mind broke when he tried to&nbsp;
fight STEM, allowing STEM to put&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:11.120
his consciousness away and fully possess his&nbsp;
body. STEM fires the gun at Cortez and leaves.

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:14.320
Grey remains in the reality STEM made for him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:18.160
happily reunited with his wife, while&nbsp;
STEM leaves the scene in total control.
