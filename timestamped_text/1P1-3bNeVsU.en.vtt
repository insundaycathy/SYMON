00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.440
Hey Guys, welcome back to our&nbsp;
movie recap channel. Today,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:08.000
we will be reviewing a french movie from&nbsp;
1992, called “The Lover”. In this movie,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.800
we will see how a 15 year old girl falls in&nbsp;
love with a 32 year old chinese businessman.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.320
Due to the controversial plot of this&nbsp;
movie, and the many adult scenes it has,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.280
the movie was banned in many countries.&nbsp;
Please turn on subtitles, and spoilers ahead.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.200
At the start of the movie, we see a ferry&nbsp;
preparing to leave for its destination.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.680
The ferry is packed with the locals, and among&nbsp;
them is Jane, the main character of the movie.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.080
She is a 15 year old french school girl from&nbsp;
a remote village in Vietnam. Her mother is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.560
a school teacher in that village. And she has&nbsp;
two brothers. Her elder brother Pierre is the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:43.440
bully of the house. He acts like the head of the&nbsp;
house and he has his younger brother in control.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.640
Paul is just the opposite of Pierre. He easily&nbsp;
gets intimidated by Pierre and is scared of him.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.360
Jane lives in a school hostel in Saigon, and&nbsp;
was there to spend the holidays with her family.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.840
But, due to Pierre, Jane isn’t exactly&nbsp;
happy. She doesn’t like him bullying Paul,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.400
and screams at him. Jane’s mother seeing the&nbsp;
rude behavior of Pierre says nothing to him.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.000
Jane says that she only loves Pierre&nbsp;
and doesn’t care about her and Paul.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.080
Her mother says she loves all of them&nbsp;
equally, but Jane knows that she is lying.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.160
Despite running the school in the village,&nbsp;
Jane’s family are financially struggling.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.200
And Pierre being the eldest&nbsp;
male of the house, does nothing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.480
Instead, he steals money from&nbsp;
his mother to smoke opium.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.640
Today was the last day of her vacation,&nbsp;
and Jane is returning back to Saigon.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.120
Her mother hands her some money and bids her&nbsp;
fare well. She gets to the ferry, and is waiting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.920
for it to leave. A vehicle of a rich man also&nbsp;
boards the ferry, and then the ferry starts.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.400
The owner of the car starts looking at&nbsp;
Jane from his car. He finds her beautiful.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.120
So, he steps out to get a clear look.&nbsp;
His name is Tony, a rich chinese man.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:48.240
He steps forwards and goes near where Jane&nbsp;
is. He offers her a cigarette. So, it shows&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.280
that he clearly doesn’t think that Jane is an&nbsp;
underage girl. Jane kindly declines Tony’s offer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.640
for a smoke. Tony tries to strike a conversation,&nbsp;
but he gets no response from Jane. Then, he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.320
compliments Jane on her beauty, and this time Jane&nbsp;
replies. Tony tells Jane that if she doesn’t mind,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:10.240
he can take her to Saigon in his car. Jane agrees&nbsp;
to it. She leaves from the ferry, in Tony’s car.

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.880
In the car, Jane notices Tony’s ring, and&nbsp;
she is definitely intrigued by his wealth.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.920
Tony asks Jane about her age. Despite her&nbsp;
being 15 years old, Jane lies about her age,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.480
and tells Tony that she is 17.&nbsp;
Tony replies that he is 32.&nbsp;

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.120
Jane tells him that she studies in a school&nbsp;
in Saigon, but lives in a separate hostel.&nbsp;

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.080
Tony tells her about his family. His mother died&nbsp;
10 years ago, and since her death, his father&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.200
became sad and hasn’t left the house. His father&nbsp;
takes care of the business all from his bed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.520
Tony says that he quite doesn’t understand how&nbsp;
his father could love his mother that much. 
 &nbsp;

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:48.000
On their way, Tony tries to get close to&nbsp;
her. He gently caresses her finger with his,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.120
and Jane doesn’t stop him. Slowly, they hold&nbsp;
each other’s hand. They finally reach Saigon,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.440
and Tony’s driver lets her off. Jane&nbsp;
says Goodbye and then enters her hostel.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.200
At the hostel, she tells her friend&nbsp;
about Tony driving her off to Saigon,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.600
but she doesn’t reveal everything that happened&nbsp;
between them. Next day, on her way to school,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.720
Jane notices Tony’s car, and realizes that Tony&nbsp;
was there to see her. She goes near to the car,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.560
and kisses Tony through the window.&nbsp;
Jane then quickly enters the school.

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.600
After her school, Jane starts to look around for&nbsp;
Tony, but she doesn’t find him. Then, one day,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.640
Tony is at her hostel. Jane gets ready and leaves&nbsp;
with him in his car. They both look at each other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.600
but don’t say a word. Tony takes her to a house,&nbsp;
and tells her that this house was gifted to him by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.640
his father. Tony tells her that this house was&nbsp;
used by rich chinese men for their mistresses.

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.840
Tony tells Jane that he wants to be&nbsp;
in a physical relationship with her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.920
but he is also afraid that he will fall in&nbsp;
love with her. Getting nervous, Tony says&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.160
that they should leave. But, Jane insists&nbsp;
that she doesn’t mind being his mistress.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.320
Then, not knowing about Jane’s real age,&nbsp;
Tony starts to get intimate with her.

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:54.560
At night, Jane tells Tony about her wanting&nbsp;
to be a writer. She tells him that she wants&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.480
to write about her family. She also tells&nbsp;
him that since the death of her father,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.720
her family has been struggling financially.&nbsp;
Tony asks her if she came with him because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.560
of his money. Jane answers that she&nbsp;
came with him, because she likes him.

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.520
Tony takes Jane to dinner&nbsp;
in an expensive restaurant.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.760
Jane seems extremely happy to be there.&nbsp;

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.520
Tony grabs his wallet to pay the bill.&nbsp;
He puts down a few bills of money,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:21.040
which Jane can’t help but glance at. Looking at&nbsp;
Jane’s expression, Tony also cracks a smile.   
 &nbsp;

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:25.360
During the dinner, Jane says, that her mother&nbsp;
believes that once a girl loses her virginity,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.080
it’s impossible for her to find a husband. Tony&nbsp;
also replies that his father wouldn't allow him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.560
to marry anyone except of chinese women.&nbsp;
Hearing this, Jane jokes that it is good,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:39.680
since she doesn’t like chinese men. But, that&nbsp;
night, Jane thinks of Tony’s words, and cries.

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.920
After that day, Jane was always picked up by&nbsp;
Tony’s driver during her holiday, and she would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:49.040
go to meet Tony at his bachelor house. And their&nbsp;
intimacy was growing stronger with every visit.

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.720
One night, Tony tells Jane that his father&nbsp;
wants him to marry the daughter of a rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:57.040
chinese businessman. Jane asks him if&nbsp;
he knows that woman. Tony replies that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.960
he doesn’t know her at all. Jane acts&nbsp;
like this doesn’t concern her at all.

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:05.360
Jane and Tony, both know that they can’t be&nbsp;
together for ever. So, they try not to take&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:09.840
these things seriously. They’re just focused on&nbsp;
the physical relationship they have going on.

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:15.360
One day, Jane returns to her house on&nbsp;
vacation. But she came there in Tony’s car.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.720
So, her mother interrogates her&nbsp;
about who dropped her to their house.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.560
Jane replies that it was a rich friend&nbsp;
that they don’t know. But Jane’s mother&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:27.200
shows her a letter from her hostel, which says&nbsp;
that she often spent nights outside the hostel.

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:30.320
Jane doesn’t say anything, and&nbsp;
Pierre starts calling her names,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:34.800
and encourages his mother to hit her. But,&nbsp;
her mother doesn’t know what to do and leaves.

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:40.000
At the end of her vacation, Jane takes her family&nbsp;
to meet Tony. Tony acts respectfully towards them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.480
but they all seem disinterested in him. Tony&nbsp;
begins to tell them about himself, but they’re&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:49.120
all just focused on eating. Jane is aware of&nbsp;
all this, but she doesn't do or say anything,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.840
because she doesn’t want her family to know about&nbsp;
her feelings for Tony. She wants her family to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:58.000
think that Tony was just a rich friend,&nbsp;
and not someone she loved or slept with.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.040
After the dinner, Tony opens&nbsp;
his wallet to pay the bill.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:06.000
Jane’s mother is surprised by the amount of money&nbsp;
that Tony has. They leave the restaurant and go to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.520
another place. Pierre starts a fight, but Tony&nbsp;
keeps his composure and sits down. Meanwhile,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:14.880
Jane acts unfazed by the behavior&nbsp;
of their family towards Tony.

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:19.040
She even starts to dance with Paul, and Tony&nbsp;
watches it with almost a tear falling down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:23.920
from his eyes. He realizes that Jane’s family&nbsp;
came to meet him only because of his money.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:27.520
He thinks that Jane too was involved&nbsp;
with him, only because he was rich.

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.960
Later that night, Tony takes&nbsp;
Jane back to his bachelor house.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:35.600
Jane is nervous because of the way Tony was&nbsp;
treated by her family. Tony comes close to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:40.800
her and slaps her. He thinks that Jane slept with&nbsp;
him not because she liked him, but for his money.

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:45.360
Tony starts to take his clothes off, and&nbsp;
Jane just lies down without any emotion.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:49.200
That night was different from all the&nbsp;
others they had previously spent together.

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:52.800
Jane, to act like she doesn’t like&nbsp;
him, asks Tony for some money.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:58.000
Tony takes some money out of his wallet, and&nbsp;
throws it down. He seems frustrated by everything.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.560
Jane takes that money and gives it to her mother.&nbsp;
Her mother then talks to the hostel warden,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:05.840
and asks her to let Jane leave&nbsp;
the hostel anytime she wants.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:10.320
Jane’s mother was doing it so Jane could go&nbsp;
meet Tony and take more money from him. She&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:15.200
thinks that Tony is just a rich friend of Jane.&nbsp;
She doesn’t know that Jane is sleeping with him.

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:20.400
But soon enough, everyone at the school finds&nbsp;
out about Jane and Tony. She becomes an outcast.

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:25.280
One night, Tony is leaving to meet his father&nbsp;
to talk about his marriage. Before leaving, he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:30.640
gives Jane the ring that belonged to his mother.&nbsp;
Despite everything, he still had feelings for her.

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:35.040
Tony goes to his father, and tells him that he&nbsp;
doesn’t want to marry the girl that his father&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:39.760
had arranged. He says that he is in love with&nbsp;
Jane. But his father doesn’t allow this idea,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:43.120
and tells him that he has to marry&nbsp;
the girl that he has arranged.

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:46.960
Tony goes to Jane and tells her about&nbsp;
everything. He says that he loves her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:51.200
but also cannot go against his father, because&nbsp;
he is nothing without his father’s money.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:56.720
Tony is in a dilemma, he doesn’t know what to do.&nbsp;
But, Jane tells Tony that she doesn’t love him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:02.240
So, he should marry the girl that his father&nbsp;
wants. Hearing this from Jane, Tony becomes sad.

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:06.720
Jane takes Tony to their family property.&nbsp;
She tells Tony that when her father died,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:12.080
her mother was lied to by land sellers, and was&nbsp;
sold flood lands. That was how they became poor.

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:15.280
Jane stays there thinking about the&nbsp;
pain her mother might have suffered.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:18.560
And Tony shares her emotion, but&nbsp;
there is a distance between them.

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:23.200
The last night of their being together, Tony asks&nbsp;
Jane to tell him that she only slept with him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:27.920
because of his money. Jane repeats the&nbsp;
exact words that Tony wants her to say.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:31.280
Tony wants her to say this to make&nbsp;
it easier for him to forget her.

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:34.800
Jane tries to get close to him.&nbsp;
But Tony stops her and says that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:37.840
he is ashamed of himself for not&nbsp;
being able to take Jane with him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:42.320
He also says that he no longer wants to&nbsp;
sleep with Jane, because she didn’t love him.

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:46.640
Next day, Jane goes to her house in Tony’s&nbsp;
car. Her mother and brother see the ring&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:51.680
that Tony had given her. They ask her why Tony&nbsp;
gave her such an expensive gift. Pierre says&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:56.240
that Jane was probably sleeping with Tony, and&nbsp;
that’s why he gave that expensive ring to her.

00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:00.560
To avert their suspicion, Jane throws the&nbsp;
ring and says that she doesn’t care about it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:04.720
But Pierre doesn’t believe her at all.&nbsp;
He slaps her and starts hitting her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:08.240
Paul hears everything, but he is&nbsp;
helpless and can’t do anything.

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:12.400
After seeing Pieere get violent, his mother&nbsp;
sends him back to France, to join the war,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:17.680
to keep her other two children safe. But she is&nbsp;
sad to see him go away, as she loved him the most.

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:20.880
Few months later, Jane goes&nbsp;
back to Tony’s bachelor house,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:25.520
and finds him completely changed. He was&nbsp;
lifeless, and spent his days smoking.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:30.000
Jane asks him when he was getting married.&nbsp;
Tony replies that it was just days later.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.880
And when that day came, Jane went to see the&nbsp;
marriage of Tony and his wife. Tony sees Jane,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:39.520
but he quickly averts his eyes. Jane gets&nbsp;
sad as she sees Tony and his wife leave.

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:44.800
Jane goes to her house. Her family is preparing&nbsp;
to leave Vietnam. Her mother reveals that Tony&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:49.840
had paid the debt that Pierre had made in Vietnam,&nbsp;
and he also paid for their trip back to France.

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:54.480
Before leaving for France, Jane goes back to&nbsp;
Tony’s bachelor house and sits there waiting for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:59.840
him. She hopes that Tony will come to see her one&nbsp;
last time. She waits for hours, but Tony doesn’t&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:05.200
show up. So, she leaves the house without getting&nbsp;
to meet Tony, and be with him for the last time.

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:10.000
As Jane leaves Vietnam, she sees Tony’s car&nbsp;
sitting there, just like when they first met.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.560
Tony isn’t visible, but she knows that he is&nbsp;
watching her, and she is watching him too.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:18.480
As the ship started drifting away,&nbsp;
she no longer could see Tony’s car.

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:22.000
Years go by, and one day, Jane&nbsp;
receives a call from Tony.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.600
It has been years since their life&nbsp;
was separated. But Tony tells her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:30.080
that he still loves her, and will always&nbsp;
love her. And with this, the movie ends.
