00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:06.720
Hi, Mystery Recapped here. Today I’m going&nbsp;
to explain an American family/comedy film&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.280
called “The Parent Trap.” Spoilers&nbsp;
ahead! Watch out and take care!
 
&nbsp;

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:21.520
The movie begins with children arriving at Camp&nbsp;
Walden for an 8 week long all-girls summer camp.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.960
The girls seem overjoyed to&nbsp;
be camping next to Moose Lake.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:30.560
Hallie Parker is an 11-year-old girl from&nbsp;
Northern California. Hallie’s father,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.680
Nick Parker, owns a huge vineyard. Hallie&nbsp;
quickly befriends two girls at the camp. 
 
&nbsp;

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:41.840
Meanwhile, Annie is an 11-year-old girl from&nbsp;
London. Annie’s mother Elizabeth James is a famous&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.560
wedding gown designer. Annie’s family butler,&nbsp;
Martin, drops her at the camp. They share an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:51.680
intricate handshake before parting ways. Although&nbsp;
Hallie and Annie have contrasting characters,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:57.120
they both look identical. Annie is prim&nbsp;
and proper, while Hallie is more carefree.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.920
At the camp, the two girls go head to head&nbsp;
in a fencing match, unaware of their uncanny&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.600
identicalness. Both the girls are extremely gifted&nbsp;
at fencing and give each other a good competition.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.080
In the end, Annie triumphs and inadvertently&nbsp;
pushes Hallie into the water with her last&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:18.320
move. Annie quickly apologizes and offers her hand&nbsp;
to Hallie. However, Haley takes her hand and pulls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.880
Annie into the water with her. When the two girls&nbsp;
take their fencing masks off, they are awestruck&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.840
to learn that they look identical. Hallie quickly&nbsp;
snaps out of it and insults Annie. The two&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.520
girls have a go mouth off and almost get physical&nbsp;
when the camp counselor breaks them up. 
 
&nbsp;

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:37.520
Later the two little girls again butt heads over&nbsp;
a game of poker. Hallie proposes a punishment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.640
that whoever loses the game will have to jump in&nbsp;
the Moose Lake naked. Annie confidently accepts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.600
the challenge but Hallie beats her with a royal&nbsp;
flush. Annie is then forced to jump in the lake,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.480
after which Hallie and her friends steal Annie’s&nbsp;
clothes and run away. When Annie learns that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:57.600
Hallie tricked her, she vows to take revenge. 
The comical hostility between the two girls leads&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.400
to a prank war that ends when the camp counselors&nbsp;
fall into one of Hallie's traps and isolate the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:07.120
twins from the other girls. The two girls are&nbsp;
told to pack their bags and sent to live together&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:12.160
in the isolation cabin as punishment. The two&nbsp;
girls continue to clash with each other. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.040
they soon become close after Annie helps Hallie&nbsp;
close the jammed window. They tell each other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.360
about their homes and families. Annie hasn't&nbsp;
had a dad in her life since her dad and mother&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.000
got divorced when she was little. While Hallie&nbsp;
doesn’t have a mother and she lives with her dad.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.480
After learning that the two also share the same&nbsp;
birthday, Annie starts suspecting that all of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.360
this can’t be mere coincidences. Annie and Hallie&nbsp;
then show each other the only pictures of their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.320
father and mother they have respectively. It turns&nbsp;
out each has half of a torn wedding photograph&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:45.280
of their parents. They realize Annie and Hallie&nbsp;
are actual twin sisters. They are elated by the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.760
discovery. They tape their parents' half-torn&nbsp;
picture back together and spend hours together,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.920
learning about their mother and father. 
As the end of the summer camp approaches, they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.800
long to know more about their parents, so Hallie&nbsp;
then proposes an idea. She suggests they switch&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.760
places and go back home as one another. Annie&nbsp;
tells her that they will immediately get caught,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.160
but Hallie insists that they will be able to pull&nbsp;
it off as they both look identical and they can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.400
learn how to imitate each other. Moreover,&nbsp;
even if they get caught sooner or later,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.640
their parents will have to meet face to face&nbsp;
because of it. The two girls then spend their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.200
remaining time at the camp learning and practicing&nbsp;
each other's mannerisms. They learn about each&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.320
other's house's blueprint. Hallie learns Annie's&nbsp;
intricate handshake. While Annie cuts hair and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:30.480
gets her ears pierced with a hot needle.
The summer camp comes to an end and the twins&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.920
put their plan into action. Hallie goes back to&nbsp;
London as Annie. She perfectly impersonates Annie,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.400
effortlessly imitating Annie's handshake and&nbsp;
mannerisms so much, so that Annie's butler&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.800
Martin is not able to tell the difference. 
Meanwhile, Hallie is elated to meet her mother and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:50.400
maternal grandfather, Charles, for the first time.&nbsp;
She hugs them tightly which surprises Elizabeth.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.680
She tags along with Elizabeth to her work to spend&nbsp;
more time with her. At an opportune time, Hallie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:01.040
broaches the topic of her father Nick. She asks&nbsp;
Elizabeth if she remembers him and how they met.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:06.000
Elizabeth is surprised by the sudden curiosity but&nbsp;
tells Hallie about Nick. She says that Nick was a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.080
lovely guy and they met aboard the Queen Elizabeth&nbsp;
2(QE2), an ocean Liner that sails from London to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:17.120
New York. They were traveling on a ship because&nbsp;
both Nick and Elizabeth weren’t keen on flying.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.360
They were seated next to each other for&nbsp;
dinner on the first night of their voyage.
 
&nbsp;

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:27.040
Meanwhile, Annie pretends to be Hallie and goes&nbsp;
to California. She’s overjoyed to meet her father.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:32.000
The little girl can’t believe that she’s talking&nbsp;
to her father. She even keeps calling him ‘dad’&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.200
in every other sentence due to excitement. Annie&nbsp;
is greeted at home by Hallie’s lovely nanny Chessy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:42.080
and dog Sammy. Chessy isn’t able to tell the&nbsp;
difference between Annie and Hallie, but Sammy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.720
seems to have caught up to Annie’s charade and&nbsp;
keeps barking at her. Annie’s excitement soon&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:52.640
subsides when she comes to know about Nick’s new&nbsp;
young fiance, Meredith Blake. Nick and Meredith&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:57.760
seem very into each other. However, Chessy&nbsp;
speculates that Meredith is only after Nick’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:03.040
money. Annie herself grows to dislike Meredith&nbsp;
after getting a feel of her selfish ways. 
 
&nbsp;

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:07.440
The next day, Nick finally asks Annie how&nbsp;
she would feel if Meredith becomes a part&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.840
of their family. Feigning her Ignorance,&nbsp;
Annie responds that she would love it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:15.920
She adds that she always wanted a big sister&nbsp;
and now Nick is about to adopt Meredith.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:23.120
Burn! But Nick quickly corrects her and reveals&nbsp;
that he is actually going to marry Meredith.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:28.560
Left with no choice and forced to acknowledge,&nbsp;
Annie responds negatively and screams in French;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:33.360
a language Hallie doesn’t know. Nick is surprised&nbsp;
by her behavior but Meredith assures him that it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:38.160
is normal and expected of a child whose father is&nbsp;
getting remarried. Meredith then goes to talk to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:43.280
Annie. She pretends to empathize with Annie, but&nbsp;
Annie sees through Meredith’s charade and cuts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:48.480
her short. Annie acknowledges that Meredith is&nbsp;
young, beautiful, sexy and perhaps that’s what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:53.840
attracts her dad, after all he’s only human but&nbsp;
she adds marriage should be more than just sex.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:59.360
Seeing her charm offensive strategy terribly&nbsp;
fail on Annie, Meredith drops her pretense.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:03.840
She candidly tells Annie that Nick and her are&nbsp;
getting married in two weeks whether Annie likes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:08.800
it or not and she needs to get over it. 
Distressed by Meredith's deviousness, Annie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:13.360
telephones Hallie. Annie tells her twin sister&nbsp;
about their father’s impending wedding. Annie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:18.640
persuades her to bring Elizabeth to California&nbsp;
to break up the engagement. However, Charles&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:23.840
catches Hallie on the phone. Charles forces her&nbsp;
to come clean to her mother immediately. Hallie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:28.720
is scared but she tells Elizabeth everything. She&nbsp;
apologizes to Elizabeth for deceiving her. But&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:33.120
instead of scolding the little girl, Elizabeth&nbsp;
gets emotional and embraces her daughter. 
 
&nbsp;

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:38.400
Meanwhile, in California, Chessy too figures&nbsp;
out that it's Annie and not Hallie there. Soon,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:43.280
everyone finds out about it except for Nick and&nbsp;
Meredith, who remain unaware of the switch.
 
&nbsp;

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:48.480
Hallie convinces Elizabeth to fly to California to&nbsp;
meet Nick and fix their relationship but she keeps&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:52.640
Elizabeth in the dark about Nick’s engagement&nbsp;
and tells her that Nick is eager to meet her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:56.400
Even after all these years, Elizabeth&nbsp;
still seems to be in love with Nick.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:02.080
Nervous about meeting him, Elizabeth asks Martin&nbsp;
to accompany Hallie and her as a friend. 
 
&nbsp;

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:07.760
To bring Nick and Elizabeth together, Hallie,&nbsp;
Annie, Chessy, Martin, and Charles conspire to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:12.400
have them meet at a hotel in San Francisco.&nbsp;
Nick is scheduled to meet Meredith’s parents&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:17.280
at the same hotel. Elizabeth runs into Nick,&nbsp;
boo’d up with Meredith, at the hotel elevator.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:22.160
She gets suspicious and confronts her twin&nbsp;
daughters. The two girls come clean and reveal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:26.720
that Nick is engaged and getting married in two&nbsp;
weeks. Annie tells her mom that she can’t let&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:31.680
it happen but Elizabeth, hurt, responds that&nbsp;
Nick and her have nothing in common anymore.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:36.720
She then continues by saying that Nick seems to&nbsp;
be happy with his fiance. Putting her foot down,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:41.600
Elizabeth adds that she will do what she came to&nbsp;
do and will fly back to London with Annie. 
 
&nbsp;

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:45.840
However, Nick is elated to have run&nbsp;
into Elizabeth after so many years.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:50.320
He looks for her throughout the hotel. When he&nbsp;
finally notices her, he accidentally falls in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:54.800
the pool in excitement. Just as Nick breaks&nbsp;
the ice between Elizabeth and him, Annie and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.800 --> 00:08:00.240
Hallie arrive. They come clean about the switch.&nbsp;
Although a bit taken aback by the revelation,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:04.960
Nick gets overjoyed and emotional to&nbsp;
see his other daughter after 11 years.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:08.480
Meredith too soon catches up with&nbsp;
the development to her dismay. 
&nbsp;

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:13.440
Later that evening, the two girls give their&nbsp;
parents a surprise. It is a candlelit dinner,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:18.560
served by Chessy and Martin, on a yacht decorated&nbsp;
to recreate their first meeting aboard the Queen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:24.240
Elizabeth 2. Nick and Elizabeth reminisce about&nbsp;
their past time spent together, both good and bad.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:29.280
It is revealed that Elizabeth left Nick after they&nbsp;
had a huge argument. They were then both young,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:35.280
stupid, and had bad tempers. They said hurtful&nbsp;
things to each other. Elizabeth expresses slight&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:39.600
sadness over Nick not following her after&nbsp;
she left. Nick responds that he was not sure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:44.000
if Elizabeth wanted him to. They finally make&nbsp;
plans for the girls to spend holidays together&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:49.280
but decide against resuming their relationship.
Dismayed but determined, Hallie and Annie vow not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:54.400
to leave each other. The two girls hatch a plan.&nbsp;
The next day, they wear similar dresses to confuse&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:59.840
their parents and refuse to reveal which twin is&nbsp;
which as Elizabeth gets ready to leave for London.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:04.000
The twin girls put forth a condition where the&nbsp;
4 of them would have to go on a camping trip,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:09.120
only after which they will reveal their identity.&nbsp;
Initially reluctant, Nick and Elizabeth finally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:11.120
agree to take them on the camping trip, the annual&nbsp;
outing Nick and Hallie take before school starts.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:16.720
As expected, Meredith isn’t happy with the trip&nbsp;
and insists on tagging along. Despite Nick being&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:21.040
hesitant, Elizabeth invites Meredith to the&nbsp;
camping with Nick and the girls, while she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:25.680
stays behind at the Parker residence. 
The 4 then take off and start hiking.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:30.240
Meredith isn’t used to the altitude and soon&nbsp;
gets tired. The girls take advantage of that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:34.800
and play various tricks on Meredith. When she&nbsp;
stops to take a rest, They put heavy stones in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:39.360
her backpack and scare her with a lizard.&nbsp;
Meredith has a hard time carrying her bags&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:44.000
and the two girls offer to help her. Meredith&nbsp;
rudely declines and says that she sees through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.480
the two girls' angelic faces. She threatens&nbsp;
to make their lives miserable after she gets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:53.120
married to their dad if they play one more trick&nbsp;
on her, but the girls continue to prank her.
&nbsp;

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:57.040
At night, Meredith, who is tired of&nbsp;
hiking and dealing with the two sisters,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:01.120
plants a long kiss on Nick before taking&nbsp;
a sleeping pill and going to bed early. 
&nbsp;

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:06.520
Later after Nick goes to sleep, Annie and Hallie&nbsp;
drag an asleep Meredith with her inflatable air&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:11.680
bed into the lake. Meredith wakes up the next&nbsp;
morning in the middle of the lake by a bird.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:16.000
She freaks out and falls into the water.&nbsp;
Meredith finally loses her patience and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.960
angrily gives Nick an ultimatum to choose&nbsp;
between her or his daughters. Nick finally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:25.760
realizes Meredith’s bad attitude and gets to know&nbsp;
that his daughters won’t be fine with her. Hence,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:30.560
he chooses the girls over Meredith without&nbsp;
thinking much and breaks off the engagement. 
 
&nbsp;

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:34.080
Although Annie and Hallie are both punished&nbsp;
for their shenanigans, they accept it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:39.120
as they got rid of Meredith for good. Elizabeth&nbsp;
apologizes to Nick for inviting Meredith on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:42.400
trip and breaking their engagement.&nbsp;
Nick jokingly responds that he knows&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:46.560
that Elizabeth deliberately tricked Meredith&nbsp;
into going camping with Hallie and Annie. 
&nbsp;

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:50.880
Later that night, after putting the girls to&nbsp;
bed, Nick shows Elizabeth his wine collection.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:56.480
It includes a 1983 wine that they drank at their&nbsp;
wedding. Elizabeth gets emotional but tries to put&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:56.480 --> 00:11:01.840
on a strong face. Nick tells her that she doesn’t&nbsp;
always have to be brave. They get drawn to almost&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:07.440
kiss, but Elizabeth holds back. She is almost in&nbsp;
tears by the encounter but decides to ignore it. A&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:12.560
hesitant Nick then puts the wine back. Later, the&nbsp;
four of them are saying their emotional goodbyes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:18.240
as they hug each other. Elizabeth then returns&nbsp;
to London with Annie as the rain pours down.

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:22.640
Annie is dejected after being separated&nbsp;
from her sister and father again. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:26.320
when Annie and Elizabeth get home, they&nbsp;
find Hallie and Nick waiting for them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:31.440
Nick and Hallie flew to London on the Concorde,&nbsp;
which cuts travel time by half compared to general&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:35.360
passenger planes. They explain that they had&nbsp;
realized they didn't want to lose Annie and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:40.080
Elizabeth again. Nick tells Elizabeth that he&nbsp;
made the mistake of not coming after her once,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:45.280
and he is not going to make that mistake again.&nbsp;
Elizabeth is fearful of remarrying, but she yields&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:50.400
to Nick's unwavering confidence, and Hallie and&nbsp;
Annie look on happily as their parents embrace.
