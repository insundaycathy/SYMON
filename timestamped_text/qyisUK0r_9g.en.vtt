Linda discovered that the machine was
 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.760 align:start position:0%
Linda discovered that the machine was
full<00:05:29.120><c> of</c><00:05:29.240><c> variables</c><00:05:29.780><c> and</c><00:05:30.020><c> this</c><00:05:30.350><c> is</c><00:05:30.530><c> why</c><00:05:30.710><c> you</c>

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:30.770 align:start position:0%
full of variables and this is why you
 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:32.950 align:start position:0%
full of variables and this is why you
portrayed<00:05:31.280><c> a</c><00:05:31.310><c> scared</c><00:05:31.670><c> image</c><00:05:32.000><c> however</c><00:05:32.570><c> in</c>

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.350 align:start position:0%
portrayed a scared image however in

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:35.360 align:start position:0%
removing these variables one was able to
 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.780 align:start position:0%
removing these variables one was able to
gain<00:05:35.660><c> a</c><00:05:35.690><c> crystal-clear</c><00:05:36.500><c> image</c><00:05:36.920><c> which</c><00:05:37.430><c> was</c><00:05:37.760><c> a</c>

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:37.790 align:start position:0%

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:40.160 align:start position:0%
possible past though forest states that
 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.160 align:start position:0%

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:42.170 align:start position:0%
the machine knows everything it doesn't
 

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:44.560 align:start position:0%
the machine knows everything it doesn't
and<00:05:42.350><c> thus</c><00:05:42.830><c> it</c><00:05:43.070><c> created</c><00:05:43.520><c> scattered</c><00:05:43.970><c> images</c><00:05:44.360><c> I</c>

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:44.570 align:start position:0%
and thus it created scattered images I
 

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:46.930 align:start position:0%
and thus it created scattered images I
used<00:05:45.020><c> this</c><00:05:45.170><c> example</c><00:05:45.230><c> of</c><00:05:45.800><c> my</c><00:05:45.920><c> prior</c><00:05:46.190><c> video</c><00:05:46.520><c> but</c>
