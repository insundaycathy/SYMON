00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.090
Welcome to Movie Shortens.

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:04.830
Follow us today to a movie titled: Last Action
Hero.

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.890
Be aware, there are spoilers!

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.230
The movie begins with a large number of police
officers tending to a hostage situation in

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:13.530
Los Angeles.

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.180
Plain clothed officer Jack Slater arrives
in his open topped car and strides purposefully

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.580
towards the building, ignoring the instructions
of Lieutenant Dekker and the mayor, who plead

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:23.820
with him to stop.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.529
Pushing various cops aside with force, Slater
makes his entrance.

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:31.769
Now on the top of the building, there are
many children huddling together in fear, while

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.600
the protagonist, The Ripper, holds an axe
to the neck of one - Slater’s son, Andy.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.890
Slater is told to throw down all the weapons
he is carrying.

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.340
He follows the command for the kids’ safety.

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.610
However, he has kept a grenade to hand, which
he throws onto the ground at the feet of The

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.309
Ripper and his son.

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:52.809
As The Ripper laughs at this, Andy picks it
up, presses a button to reveal a hidden blade

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:55.170
and stabs his assailant with it.

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.760
In the ensuing melee, Slater is able to shoot
the aggressor…

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.579
Before we can make out what has happened,
we arrive in a cinema in New York in which

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.860
Danny Madigan is watching this clearly out-of-focus
movie.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.020
Danny gives up on the film and heads out of
the cinema to complain, eventually to the

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.630
owner and projectionist, his friend Nick.

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.220
In the conversation that follows, Nick invites
Danny - who should have been at school - to

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.720
come back at midnight for a preview of Jack
Slater IV.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:26.330
When Danny gets home, his worried and recently
widowed mother, Irene, is waiting for him.

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.829
Despite her annoyance at him skipping school,
she gives him a big hug and tells him to lock

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:32.770
the door while she goes out.

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.329
Later at night, a burglar is able to get in
though, but is frustrated to find the family

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:39.180
have little worth stealing.

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.290
During the break-in, he handcuffs Danny in
the bathroom.

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.869
As the burglar makes his exit, he throws the
key for the cuffs into the toilet bowl, instructing

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:48.680
Danny to “go fishing”.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.470
Having reported the incident to the police,
Danny is aware the movie preview is scheduled

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:53.900
to begin soon.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.850
In a hurry, he makes his way back to the theatre
where Nick lets him in, but insists he needs

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.460
a ticket for the film.

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:05.479
As a kind gesture, Nick hands Danny a golden
ticket once given to him by his hero, the

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:09.959
magician Harry Houdini, who reveals to have
himself received it from a mystical man in

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:10.959
India.

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:15.380
Nick tears the ticket, reminds Danny to keep
the stub and the young movie fan enters the

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.760
theatre, armed with a bucket of popcorn ready
to enjoy the film.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.260
In the opening sequences of the movie, an
Italian mob boss and his British henchman

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.030
Benedict are interrogating Frank, Jack Slater’s
second cousin, by the pool of a stunning villa

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.700
overlooking the ocean.

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.280
The scene cuts to a smaller house, which two
police officers are attempting to enter in

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.209
an apparent drug bust.

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:41.930
Before they can do so, Slater arrives and
gains entry himself to find his second cousin

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.930
gagged and bound in the hall.

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.650
With his last words, Frank informs Slater
that the two big mafia families plan to join

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:49.730
forces.

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.069
He spots a note addressed to him amid the
ropes binding Frank and realizes a bomb is

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:55.660
about to go off.

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.849
Back in the cinema, Danny jokes Slater can
never be killed, our hero makes it out of

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:01.819
the house just in time.

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:07.590
In the next sequence, a group of 4 of Vivaldi’s
mafiosos are pursuing Slater in a red pickup

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.050
truck, firing from the back of it with automatic
weapons.

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:14.959
It is at this point that the powers of the
ticket are revealed as it transports some

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.450
dynamite from the film into the theatre.

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:22.730
Danny attempts to suppress them using the
popcorn - and as very soon after, Danny enters

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:23.790
the movie.

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.379
He awakens in the back of Slater’s car,
fleeing from the gangsters.

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:31.630
The pursuit eventually concludes in an alley
where Slater plays chicken with those chasing

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.980
him and proves successful as the truck lurches
out of the way and crashes.

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.130
The good guys, as Danny notes, can never lose.

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:44.750
Following these confrontations, we find Slater
and Danny at the police HQ with the young

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.599
film fan repeatedly trying to convince the
cop that he is living in a movie.

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:55.080
They draw upon the evidence all around them,
such as the presence of a cartoon cat, Whiskers.

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:59.650
In the course of this scene, the fast-talking
and frequently angry Lieutenant Dekker appoints

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.780
Danny to the position of Slater’s partner
and instructs them to investigate Vivaldi’s

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:04.780
gang.

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.130
They head off to a nearby Blockbuster video
store, Danny unsuccessfully attempts to find

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.879
evidence of the previous Jack Slater movies
to prove his point.

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:16.959
However, he notes that it must be a movie
because the staff are far too attractive to

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:21.209
be working in such a store and there are no
ugly women to be seen anywhere.

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:24.900
Slater retorts that this is because they’re
in California.

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:30.220
Now working on their assignment, we find Slater
and Danny cruising around a leafy neighborhood.

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.690
Danny claims he’ll know Vivaldi’s residence,
having seen it in the opening sequences of

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:35.690
the movie.

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:40.240
Eventually, he locates it and the pair head
to the door where they are greeted by Benedict

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.090
and a number of well-trained and threatening
dogs.

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.210
They are denied entry and head off.

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:50.560
As they walk away, Benedict overhears Danny
talking to Slater about the conversation he’d

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.650
witnessed in the opening sequences of the
movie around the pool.

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:58.060
Benedict is shocked to discover Danny has
this inside information about their plans

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.550
and decides to investigate.

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.960
Later that day, we find the partners heading
to Slater’s ex-wife’s house where he is

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.160
greeted by his rather striking daughter, Whitney.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.340
We soon learn that Andy was killed in the
altercation at the start of the movie.

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:17.490
As Slater heads out to buy a cigar, Benedict
and his gang make their entry, with the white-suit

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.750
clad villain seizing Danny’s wallet and
the golden ticket.

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:25.270
Although upon his return, Slater is able to
suppress many of the gang, Benedict makes

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:31.160
it away in a shiny black SUV, despite the
efforts of Danny to stop him on a pink BMX.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:35.331
By this point of the film, the partners have
begun to figure out that Vivaldi’s plan

00:05:35.331 --> 00:05:41.380
to join forces is a ruse and he actually intends
to wipe out his rivals at an impending funeral.

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:44.190
He declares to Benedict that he wants a bloodbath.

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:47.610
Determined to stop this, Danny and Slater
arrive at the funeral.

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:52.440
Here, they are initially distracted by Slater’s
apparent friend John Practice, who Danny had

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.910
previously warned him not to trust.

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:58.669
Having been cuffed, Danny is able to free
himself using the key he’d fished from the

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:02.990
toilet back in the real world, but it is a
bullet from Whiskers that really saves the

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:04.020
day.

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:08.290
With Slater instructing Danny to operate a
nearby crane, he makes it to the top of the

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:13.330
building and funeral mere minutes before the
body laying on display is due to emit a poisonous

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:14.330
gas.

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:18.320
He is then able to drop it over the edge of
the building; He raises his hands with the

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:21.569
guns of practically every attendee trained
on him.

00:06:21.569 --> 00:06:24.819
The clothes of the corpse catch on the hook
of the crane with.

00:06:24.819 --> 00:06:28.289
He has gotten away from the rooftop and is
trying to free it.

00:06:28.289 --> 00:06:33.700
In the nick of time, they both plummet into
an oily pond, seconds before the gas is released.

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:37.720
Here they are greeted by Whitney and drive
off in her Jeep.

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:42.210
Frustrated by the failure of his plan, Benedict
returns to the mansion by the sea and shoots

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:43.229
Vivaldi.

00:06:43.229 --> 00:06:47.710
In the ensuing struggle, Benedict and his
butler fall through a portal into the real

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:50.639
world, and Slater and Danny follow them.

00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:55.810
In the real New York City, the man soon realizes
the differences of a life in reality.

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:59.990
While stealing a car, he finds out he can
now feel pain, though initially saddened to

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:03.460
discover his life to date has been little
more than a lie.

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:07.550
Following a long conversation with Danny’s
mother, Irene, his spirits pick up.

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:12.360
Meanwhile, at a nearby restaurant, Benedict
is formulating a new plan to bring the villains

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:16.190
of other movies into this world in order to
kill his rivals.

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:20.780
Our nemesis has realized that if he is able
to kill Arnold Schwarzenegger, the actor that

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:26.560
plays Jack Slater, the cop will cease to exist
leaving him free to run havoc in his movie

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:27.560
realm.

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:31.930
To this end, Benedict decides to work with
The Ripper, who he dispatches to the glamorous

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:36.250
opening night of Jack Slater IV, tasked with
murdering its star.

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:41.010
Hot in pursuit, Slater is able to use his
resemblance to Arnold to locate his seat for

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:44.980
the show and arrives just in time to save
him from assassination.

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:49.870
Impressed at their likeness, Arnold offers
to find Slater work, but he declines, suggesting

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:52.500
the actor has bought him nothing but pain.

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:57.290
Soon, another rooftop confrontation ensues
with the help of Danny, Slater is able to

00:07:57.290 --> 00:08:01.590
both electrocute the Ripper to death and also
dispatch Benedict, by shooting him in his

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:03.360
explosive glass eye.

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:07.110
The ticket stub is unfortunately destroyed
in the confrontation.

00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:11.280
With Slater having taken a bullet to the chest
during the fight, Danny realizes the only

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:15.650
way to save his friend is by transporting
him back to the fictional world.

00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:19.520
Taking the wheel of the ambulance, Danny drives
Slater to the movie theatre where they are

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:22.210
confronted by another of Benedict’s recruits.

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:26.610
Slater ingeniously suggests they find the
other half of the ticket, which Danny duly

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:27.610
does.

00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:32.070
Having the ticket stub in hand and with the
help of Nick manning the reels, he is able

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:36.039
to reopen the portal and they head back into
the world of fiction.

00:08:36.039 --> 00:08:41.349
Immediately, we see a doctor dismissing the
rapidly recovering Slater’s wounds as relatively

00:08:41.349 --> 00:08:42.640
minor ones.

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:48.269
The movie ends with Danny slipping out of
the scene, through the wall and back to reality.
