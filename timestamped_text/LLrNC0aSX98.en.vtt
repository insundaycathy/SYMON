00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:14.080
Following their successful heist in Brazil,
Dominic Toretto and his professional criminal

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:20.060
crew have fled around the world and are living
peacefully: Dom lives with Elena Neves; his

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:27.010
sister Mia Toretto lives with Brian O'Conner
and their son, Jack; Gisele Yashar and Han

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:32.920
Seoul-Oh are together; and Roman Pearce and
Tej Parker live in luxury.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:39.800
Meanwhile, DSS agents Luke Hobbs and Riley
Hicks investigate the destruction of a Russian

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:47.569
military convoy by a crew led by former British
SAS Major and special ops soldier Owen Shaw.

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:52.920
Hobbs persuades Dom to help capture Shaw by
showing him a photo of his supposedly murdered

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.890
girlfriend, Letty.

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.640
Dom and his crew accept the mission in exchange
for their amnesty and allowing them to return

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.120
to the United States.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:06.460
In London, Shaw's hideout is found, but this
is revealed to be a trap, distracting them

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.930
and the police while Shaw's crew performs
a heist at an Interpol building.

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:16.680
Shaw flees by car, detonating his hideout
and disabling most of the police, leaving

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.480
Dom, and his crew, along with Hobbs
and Riley, to pursue him.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:25.100
Letty arrives to help Shaw, shooting Dom without
hesitation before escaping.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:30.470
Back at their headquarters, Hobbs tells Dom's
crew that Shaw is stealing components to create

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.070
a deadly device, intending to sell it to the
highest bidder.

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.842
Meanwhile, Shaw's investigation into the opposing
crew reveals Letty's relationship with Dom,

00:01:38.842 --> 00:01:41.940
but she is revealed to be suffering from amnesia.

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:47.430
Dominic's crew learns that Shaw is connected
to a drug lord who was imprisoned by Brian,

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:48.659
Arturo Braga.

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.420
Brian returns to Los Angeles as a prisoner
to question Braga, who says Letty survived

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.930
the explosion that seemingly killed her; Shaw
took her in after discovering her amnesia.

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.310
With FBI's help, Brian is released from prison,
regrouping with the team in London.

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.599
Dom challenges Letty in a street racing competition;
afterward, he returns her cross necklace he

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:09.679
had kept.

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.319
After Letty leaves, Shaw offers Dom a chance
to walk away, threatening to otherwise hurt

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:16.739
his family, but Dom refuses.

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:20.209
Tej tracks Shaw's next attack to a Spanish
NATO base.

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:26.099
Shaw's crew assaults a highway military convoy
carrying a computer chip to complete his device.

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:32.310
Dom's crew interferes, while Shaw, accompanied
by Letty, commandeers a tank, destroying cars

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:33.310
en route.

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.019
Brian and Roman flip the tank before it causes
further damage, resulting in Letty being thrown

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:40.980
from the vehicle, though Dom saves her.

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.400
Shaw and his crew are captured, but reveal
Mia has been kidnapped by Shaw's henchmen

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.400
Vegh and Klaus.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.450
Hobbs is forced to release Shaw, and Riley,
who is revealed to be Shaw's covert accomplice,

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.420
leaves with him; Letty chooses to remain with
Dom.

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:01.269
Shaw's group board a moving Antonov An-124
on an exceptionally long runway as Dom's crew

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:02.370
gives chase.

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:09.909
Dom, Letty, and Brian board the craft; Brian
rescues Mia, escaping in an Alfa Romeo Giulietta.

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:14.469
The plane attempts to take-off but is held
down by excess weight as the rest of the team

00:03:14.469 --> 00:03:16.239
tether the plane to their vehicles.

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:20.340
Gisele sacrifices herself to save Han from
Shaw's henchman.

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.400
Letty kills Riley and escapes with Hobbs to
safety, but Dom pursues Shaw and the computer

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.400
chip.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.750
As the plane crashes into the ground, Shaw
is thrown from it, and Dom drives a car out

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.239
of the exploding plane.

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:36.430
Dom reunites with his crew and gives the chip
to Hobbs to secure their pardons.

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:41.120
Dom and the others return to his old family
home in Los Angeles, where Dom and his crew

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.400
have a gathering to share a meal.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.379
Meanwhile, Hobbs and Elena work together,
arrive to confirm the crew's freedom; and Elena

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:50.549
accepts that Dom loves Letty.

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:55.279
In a mid-credits scene, Han is involved in a car chase when he is suddenly broadsided

00:03:55.279 --> 00:03:56.700
by an oncoming car.

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.680
The driver walks away after leaving Letty's
cross necklace by the crash, and calls Dom

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:09.989
saying: "Dominic Toretto, you don't know me,
but, you're about to," as Han's car explodes,

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:12.040
apparently killing Han.
