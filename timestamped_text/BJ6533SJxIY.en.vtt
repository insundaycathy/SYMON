00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.950
Being overweight or obese are both terms for
having more body fat than what is considered

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:05.950
healthy.

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:09.469
To avoid it, people find ways to lose weight
safely including eating a healthy, low-calorie

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:11.349
diet and exercising.

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:15.849
However, in the following movie called: Thinner;
there is a man trying to lose weight in the

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:18.610
exact opposite way: He eats more.

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:20.160
Let’s find out how he does it.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.890
Be aware: there are spoilers!

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.410
Billy Halleck is an obese upper-class attorney
living in the suburb of Maine in Fairview

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:29.390
with his wife Heidi and a daughter Linda.

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.840
Every morning, Billy weighs himself and lets
Heidi keep track, as part of a losing weight

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.280
program for Billy.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.260
Heidi controls her husband’s diet strictly,
which makes him uncomfortable and unwilling

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:40.589
to take her food.

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:45.059
At court, by having a loophole, Billy frees
an Italian underground mafia named Richie

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.059
from homicide.

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:51.329
He is then well treated in a fancy yacht,
and Richie says he owes Billy this time.

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.210
After work, Billy joins his close friends:
Judge Cary and Police Chief Duncan for a talk

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.960
while all share a look of disdain to the Gypsies,
who currently run a carnival in the town.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.399
That night, the couple is invited to a fancy
party held by his company for the winning.

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:08.990
Heidi has to stop Billy from having too much
food and sweets.

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.530
The two leave the party earlier than expected.

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.960
While driving, Heidi reminds Billy that his
life is not only about food.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.840
She then helps Billy to have some fun in the
car.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.860
Distracted by that, Billy runs over a Gypsy
woman, making her die right away.

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:30.000
Several days later, Linda questions Billy
why he can get home so quickly after the trial.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.140
Billy and Heidi both explain to her that he
had to join a car accident investigation,

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.640
not a trial.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.659
Heidi tells her that Billy did nothing wrong
here, which confuses Linda.

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.229
At the court hearing, Judge Cary calls all
the witnesses to relate the night of the accident.

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.609
One man says the woman ran away from the store
after she was caught stealing.

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:53.080
Chief Duncan tells the court that Billy was
driving at normal speed at that time.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.780
He also gave Billy a breathalyzer, which in
fact he didn't.

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.820
Cary eventually clears Billy from any charges.

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.899
Heidi and Billy step out of the court feeling
relieved.

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:07.109
As the two get in the car, an older gypsy
man named Lempke, who reveals to be the victim’s

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:09.099
father, appears and greets Billy.

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:11.739
He then brushes Billy’s cheek and says “thinner”.

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:16.200
The man leaves with an indignant face, confusing
Billy about what happened.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.520
The following week, Billy is surprised when
standing on the scale as he has lost 14 pounds.

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:27.129
The last record was 300 pounds, which amazed
Heidi too because he has never stopped eating.

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:31.550
Billy smears at Heidi’s tough diet and thinks
he has his own way to lose weight.

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.739
Later that day, Billy joins Dr Mike and Judge
Cary for a round of golf.

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:39.870
In the changing room, Cary asks Mike if there
is something wrong with his chest.

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.099
Mike says his Psoriasis has come back due
to stress and it’ll be alright with some

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:45.099
ointment.

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:49.080
Billy weighs himself again and realizes he’s
lost two more pounds within a morning.

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.700
While showering, Billy thanks Cary for helping
him last time with the accident.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.180
The Judge reveals that he and his wife went
for lunch after the hearing.

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.290
They bumped into an old man and he touched
Cary in the chest.

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.340
Cary worries that he might get an infection
from that man.

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.540
Billy starts to realize something and asks
Cary if the man told him anything.

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.780
The Judge says he didn’t listen at the time.

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.799
He then gets angry and states that he will
kick all of the Gypsies out of town as soon

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:14.920
as possible.

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:21.640
One morning, Heidi realizes Billy has 25 pounds
lost, making it total 40 in only two weeks.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.840
She tells him to stop what he is trying to
lose weight because it is way too fast.

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.989
She thinks the sudden weight loss is a warning
sign of cancer.

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:31.660
Billy gets pissed as Heidi seems to care too
much.

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.770
Either he loses or gains weight, she’s never
satisfied.

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:39.740
Later, Billy meets with Dr Mike again and
is informed that all the tests are negative,

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:41.579
which means he is in normal state.

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:45.790
Feeling relief, Billy heads to a tailor and
buys himself new suits.

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.840
The tailor, who is seen obese too, is astonished
at Billy’s appearance.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.939
While measuring the sizes, the tailor shows
Billy his waist size, which decreases incredibly.

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:58.000
He asks to use the scale at the shop and is
amazed at the number.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.530
However, Billy continues to remain in denial
about what is happening.

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.360
He eats more, scaring Linda at home.

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.120
The girl asks if Billy is in something called
man’s menoposis.

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.340
Billy says this is the best method to his
weight, the more he consumes, the lighter

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:13.609
he becomes.

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:17.949
He keeps chewing and laughing at Linda, which
upsets the girl, so she runs to her room after

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:18.949
that.

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:22.800
Heidi cleans up the empty dishes on the table
and complains about Billy’s changes recently.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.180
Billy tells her he has desperately attempted
to eat as much as possible to see if he can

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:28.610
gain any weight.

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.949
All has failed, and he thinks only by eating
he would balance this whole madness.

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:37.960
At night, Mike informs Billy about his further
examinations, apparently the tests again show

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:38.960
normal.

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:43.740
Mike introduces Billy to another clinic and
sees if he is under other issues.

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:48.620
Billy notices Cary’s wife has dinner alone,
but Mike says Cary has left the town for his

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:49.620
sister.

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.900
However, Billy knows Cary has no siblings.

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.080
Later, Billy decides to see Cary at his house.

00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:00.039
The wife refuses to let him in, but Billy
manages to ask if Cary has lost weight recently.

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:05.229
Cary’s wife becomes terrified and confronts
if Billy has met the older Gypsy man.

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:10.550
She reveals that Lempke also touched the judge,
and whispered "lizard".

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:15.250
Cary has to hide from others because he has
transformed into a half human half lizard

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:16.380
creature, according to the wife.

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:20.380
She then throws the tantrum at Billy, accusing
him for killing that woman and bringing Cary

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:22.370
a deadly curse.

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:26.740
Billy does not believe in a gypsy curse and
leaves, while the hysterical woman screams

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:29.380
that it was all Billy's fault.

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:33.110
After that, Billy calls Richie to have more
information about the Gypsy curse.

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:37.440
Richie's mother claims that only the one who
created the curse can remove it.

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:41.509
While driving home, Heidi denies the idea
about cursing, and tells Billy that he should

00:05:41.509 --> 00:05:43.050
check him into the clinic.

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:47.760
Linda is confused about what is going on,
and Billy leaves angrily to visit Chief Duncan.

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:53.410
It is true that Duncan also experience an
extremely horrendous case of facial acne.

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:57.729
He tells Billy to take one of his guns and
kill Lempke, because he believes that Lempke

00:05:57.729 --> 00:05:59.580
will never take the curse off.

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:04.169
Billy refuses, and as he leaves, there is
a gunshot heard, Hopley commits suicide with

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:05.169
the weapon.

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:07.580
When Billy returns home, he sees Mike is leaving.

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:12.370
Knowing that it is very late, Billy begins
to suspect that Heidi is having an affair.

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:16.710
He talks about Duncan and the curses with
Heidi, only to hear her denial again.

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:21.151
This time, Billy throws his food away and
gets angry with Heidi, saying he’ll find

00:06:21.151 --> 00:06:24.430
Lempke and solve the curve by himself.

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:28.710
Billy leaves town and tracks down the gypsies,
furiously demanding for Lempke to take off

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:33.419
the curse, but he tells him that he will die
before he will take off the curse.

00:06:33.419 --> 00:06:37.410
Gina, Lempke's granddaughter, even throws
a puppet, which represents him, at Billy and

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:39.979
scares him away with a sling.

00:06:39.979 --> 00:06:44.639
Billy quickly flees away in Cary's car, who
now mutates to a lizardized human.

00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:48.470
They then drive straight into a truck which
is seemingly driven by Lempke.

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:50.580
The experience turns out to be a nightmare.

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:54.849
He calls Cary, hoping to recruit him on the
way to finding the Gypsies.

00:06:54.849 --> 00:06:58.699
Billy discovers that Judge Cary has died in
a car accident yesterday.

00:06:58.699 --> 00:07:02.630
Finally, Billy can reach the camp where the
Gypsie base is.

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:06.410
He begs Lempke to help him by showing his
skinny belly to the group.

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:11.879
However, Gina shouts at him for killing her
mother, and injures his hand by a slingshot.

00:07:11.879 --> 00:07:15.050
Billy gets back to the hotel while his hand
is badly bleeding.

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:16.460
He contacts Richie for help.

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:18.569
A doctor is sent to take care of Billy.

00:07:18.569 --> 00:07:23.169
His hand has a clear hole in the middle due
to the slingshot.

00:07:23.169 --> 00:07:27.330
After that, Billy tells everything about the
curse and his dying body to Richie.

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:32.100
The man reveals to Billy that Heidi and Mike
submitted a request for Billy's deteriorating

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:33.979
mental condition back home.

00:07:33.979 --> 00:07:38.710
Billy, who appears very sick up to now, becomes
more depressed.

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:42.490
Richie decides to send a man spying on the
Gypsies the next day.

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:47.150
However, Billy and Richie receive his corpse
as the answer from the Gypsy group soon after

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:48.150
that.

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:51.389
Now having had enough, Richie would destroy
the group at all cost.

00:07:51.389 --> 00:07:55.909
He comes to the carnival and opens fire at
the group, eventually killing one Gypsy, who

00:07:55.909 --> 00:07:56.909
is Gina’s husband.

00:07:56.909 --> 00:08:01.850
The following day, Richie disguises as an
FBI agent and lures Gina to follow him to

00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:03.389
an abandoned barn.

00:08:03.389 --> 00:08:07.900
Richie assaults Gina with a jar of acid, and
is about to shoot her, but Billy arrives and

00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:13.440
tells Richie to stop as all he wants now is
to lift the curse, not kill people.

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:17.530
Richie agrees, and tells her to tell Lempke
to meet Billy at the nearby lighthouse.

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:21.889
As appointed, Lempke meets with Billy, who
is dying from weight loss.

00:08:21.889 --> 00:08:27.330
Lempke gives Billy a pie and cuts his hand,
dripping lots of blood with the "curse inside"

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:28.539
into the pie.

00:08:28.539 --> 00:08:33.460
Lempke tells him that the curse can only be
removed by feeding some of the pie to an unsuspecting

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:34.640
person.

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:38.610
Before returning home with the “cursed”
pie, Billy first calls Linda to send her away

00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:44.650
tonight at a relative's house, lying he needs
to talk with Heidi in private.

00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:49.300
That night, Billy goes home and feeds the
pie to his wife, as punishment for her affair.

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:52.410
The next morning, Billy wakes up and seems
to gain weight again.

00:08:52.410 --> 00:08:55.790
He finds Heidi is already dead with a rotten
body.

00:08:55.790 --> 00:09:01.160
As he goes downstairs, he realizes Linda has
returned home early and had some of the pie.

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:05.500
Billy is stricken with grief and begins to
commit suicide with the pie, only when he

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:06.500
hears the doorbell.

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:08.350
It is Mike at the front door.

00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:13.840
Billy invites him in for the pie, slowly closing
the door with a mysterious smile.
