00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:07.040
Hi, Mystery Recapped here. Today I’m going&nbsp;
to explain a Japanese science fiction film&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:16.320
called “Terra Formars,” Spoilers&nbsp;
ahead! Watch out and take care! 
&nbsp;

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.360
Far in the future, overpopulation is about to&nbsp;
destroy the planet earth. To create a backup&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:26.720
plan in case our ecosystem fails, humans decide&nbsp;
to change the atmosphere of Mars and make it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:32.160
suitable for human existence. The process is&nbsp;
called terraforming. They start by growing a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.360
simpler form of life like moss on its surface.&nbsp;
The moss would help to increase the temperature&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.480
of the planet and make it similar to the earth’s&nbsp;
temperature. To spread moss over its surface,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:51.520
genetically engineered cockroaches are sent.
It is now the year 2597. Somewhere in Tokyo,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:57.280
two criminals named Komachi and Nanao are being&nbsp;
chased by the police. They run frantically through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:03.040
the crowd but are caught. As the police surround&nbsp;
them, a futuristic vehicle levitates in the sky&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:08.720
and lands nearby. Inside the vehicle is Dr.&nbsp;
Honda and his assistant. They are there to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.880
fetch the two criminals and use them for&nbsp;
their own benefit. The doctor offers them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:18.640
to be a part of the Mars colonization mission.&nbsp;
Komachi and Nanao will have to go to its surface&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.200
and eradicate all the cockroach colonies&nbsp;
since they are no longer needed. Dr. Honda&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.400
promises to pardon their crimes if they agree&nbsp;
to participate. The duo accepts the offer. 
&nbsp;

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.920
Cut to two years later, Nanao and Komachi are&nbsp;
now trained and are flying to Mars with other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.680
criminals like them in a spaceship called BUGS2.&nbsp;
Nanao is always sceptical of their competence&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.320
because their team is made up of thugs and&nbsp;
criminals. As she is talking to Komachi about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.200
the matter, the ship’s captain Keisuke Dojima&nbsp;
informs them that the ship is about to land&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.800
on Mars’s surface. She orders everyone to prepare&nbsp;
for landing. After they finally touch down on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:00.160
planet, they see that Mars is no longer red like&nbsp;
it used to be; rather, it looks more like earth,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:05.600
spread with green moss. Lieutenant Mina launches&nbsp;
a device that secretes chemicals into the air to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.560
kill the cockroaches. The captain then orders them&nbsp;
to spread around in a group of two and see if the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:16.160
eradication process is working. They plan to meet&nbsp;
in three hours and choose their team members. A&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.800
team member named Asuka is paired up with Yakuza.&nbsp;
But she strangely insists on being with the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:26.000
group’s computer specialist Ichiro. The captain&nbsp;
accepts the request, not wanting a conflict to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.840
arise. The team's drones then locate another ship&nbsp;
sent ten years ago called the BUGS1 nearby. 
&nbsp;

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.480
Dojima contacts the doctor and tells him they&nbsp;
are ready for the first contact. The doctor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.880
starts to jump excitedly, anticipating the&nbsp;
results of the mission. The groups then step&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.200
on the surface and start searching for dead&nbsp;
cockroaches. Two group members named Jen and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.920
Maria are confused to see no cockroaches&nbsp;
on the moss. As they continue looking,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:55.120
suddenly, the two come across three strange&nbsp;
creatures standing right in front of them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.760
They quickly hide behind a rock in fear. They&nbsp;
had not been told about such large creatures&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:05.600
who look like human-sized anthropomorphic&nbsp;
cockroaches and have clubs as a weapon. Meanwhile,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.320
Komachi and Nanao, who are also looking for&nbsp;
dead cockroaches, come across the same creature.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:15.360
Komachi is fascinated and tries waving at it,&nbsp;
but within seconds, the creature attacks Nanao&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.720
and snaps her neck. It then runs away in a&nbsp;
flash, leaving Nanao’s limp body on the ground.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:26.880
Nanao dies in Komachi’s arms, and he watches her&nbsp;
in distress. Just then, Jen’s team arrives and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:32.080
tells Komachi about their encounter. The creatures&nbsp;
have also killed Asuka. They rush back to the ship&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.920
and tell the captain about the creature, only to&nbsp;
find out that the captain knew about them from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.560
the very beginning. He was ordered not to tell the&nbsp;
team members about the creature by the doctor. 
&nbsp;

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.800
The captain explains that the cockroaches that&nbsp;
were sent five hundred years ago evolved at a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:49.760
rapid speed because of the abundance of radiation&nbsp;
and now have turned into creatures stronger than&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.640
humans. Now, the doctor appears as a hologram&nbsp;
in front of the team and assures them they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.520
have nothing to worry about. The doctor had been&nbsp;
preparing for this very moment for a long time.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:04.080
He has prepared distinguished injections for every&nbsp;
member that will grant them the superpowers of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:09.200
several insects. The drug will enhance their&nbsp;
DNA by combining it with that of the insect.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:14.640
Using those unique powers, they can battle the&nbsp;
evolved cockroaches. However, the members do not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:19.200
want to fight the cockroaches; rather, they want&nbsp;
to abort the mission and fly back to the earth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:25.040
immediately. But soon, their ship is surrounded&nbsp;
by the creatures. One brave team member named God&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.280
Lee volunteers to divert the cockroaches&nbsp;
until the others restart the craft. 
&nbsp;

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.600
He heads outside and injects himself with&nbsp;
the chemical that the doctor had provided.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.000
As soon as he does that, a rapid mutation&nbsp;
starts inside his body, turning him into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:44.160
a hybrid between human and ground beetles. Now,&nbsp;
Lee is able to shoot out flames from his body as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:49.680
Beetles do. With his new powers, Lee battles the&nbsp;
cockroaches, who seem to be as powerful as him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:54.560
He uses his unique power and shoots fire from&nbsp;
his hand. The force from the flames pushes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.520
the creatures back and burns them. But when it&nbsp;
subsides, it is seen that only the exoskeleton&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:04.800
of the creature is burnt. A cockroach then&nbsp;
runs towards him and kills him in a flash. 
&nbsp;

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:10.240
Meanwhile, another cockroach latches itself to the&nbsp;
spaceship and breaks its windows. It enters the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.640
craft and immediately kills two of the members,&nbsp;
making the others fear for their lives. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:17.520
captain quickly injects himself with the drug&nbsp;
and starts to evolve. His DNA is mixed with the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:22.320
DNA of bullet ants, who have the ability to carry&nbsp;
things that are a hundred times their weight. 
&nbsp;

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:27.520
The captain then easily smashes the cockroach&nbsp;
to the floor and kills it. The team celebrates,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:32.000
but their happiness is cut short when they notice&nbsp;
a crowd of cockroaches heading towards the ship&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.480
from the radar. Knowing that they cannot&nbsp;
battle them all, everyone decides to take off&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:40.480
and go back to the earth. However, when&nbsp;
the lieutenant tries to start the ship,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:45.520
the engines malfunction, and the system shuts&nbsp;
down. It seems as though someone has deliberately&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:50.320
sabotaged the ship to stop it from taking&nbsp;
off. The captain quickly thinks of a plan.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:55.840
He wants the team to go to the BUGS1 and bring all&nbsp;
the necessary parts they will need to fix BUGS2,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:01.120
while he fights the cockroaches. Everyone agrees,&nbsp;
but Ichiro asks to stay behind with the captain&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:06.000
and help him. Before making his way to the other&nbsp;
ship, Komachi goes to see Nanao’s corpse for the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.200
last time. He notices weird strings coming out&nbsp;
of her mouth but doesn’t think much of it. 
&nbsp;

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:15.600
Now, the team gets inside the Mars rover,&nbsp;
which will have to travel through a hoard&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:20.800
of cockroaches. A member named Tezuka offers&nbsp;
to help them avoid the creatures and injects&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:26.080
himself with the drug. He evolves into a Macley&nbsp;
bug who can shoot out projectiles of gases&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:31.120
in the form of flame at a very high speed.&nbsp;
He uses his power to propel the Mars rover&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:35.600
forward through the crowd of cockroaches. 
Meanwhile, the captain fights the cockroaches&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:39.760
inside the ship with all his might, but&nbsp;
more and more of them keep entering.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:44.160
He quickly makes his way to the control room&nbsp;
and vacuums out the oxygen inside the ship,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:48.800
so all the cockroaches inside would die due&nbsp;
to suffocation. His plan works, and soon,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:53.360
the cockroaches start to fall unconscious. But&nbsp;
the lack of oxygen harms the captain as well,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:58.400
making both him and Ichiro fall to the ground. 
At the same time, the team inside the rover sees&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:02.080
something massive approaching them. When&nbsp;
they get a clear look, they are surprised&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:07.840
to see a massive wave of millions of cockroaches&nbsp;
coming their way. Tsuka still doesn’t back down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:13.200
and uses all his power to propel the ship forward.&nbsp;
They strike the creatures and soon land safely on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:16.960
the other side of the cockroach wave. 
The group then happily moves forward,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:22.000
but not long after, another wave approaches them.&nbsp;
This one is even larger than the other wave,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.120
containing of millions of creatures. Tsuka cannot&nbsp;
handle them together, so two of the team members&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:32.640
named Maria and Osaku, transform themselves into&nbsp;
their hybrid versions as well. The three try&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:37.680
their best to fight off all the creatures, but the&nbsp;
rover flips and aggressively lands on the ground.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:41.520
The three are thrown to the ground, while&nbsp;
the ones inside the rover are knocked out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:46.160
The rover turns out to be on autopilot mode&nbsp;
and takes the members to the destination ship.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:51.680
Tsuka, Maria, and Osaku try fighting the hoard&nbsp;
of creatures but are eventually killed. 
&nbsp;

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:56.320
When the group inside the rover gains their&nbsp;
consciousness back, they are already at the BUGS1.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:01.120
They make their way inside while two members guard&nbsp;
the entrance. Mina tries to run a diagnostic of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:05.920
the ship, and they soon realize that the ship is&nbsp;
transmitting data to someone on earth. Just then,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:11.520
the group hears gunshots and rushes outside. Both&nbsp;
of the guards have been killed. The cockroaches&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:16.320
have found the weapons in the BUGS and are using&nbsp;
them to fight. Komachi injects himself with the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:21.440
drug and mutates into a massive hornet. With his&nbsp;
newfound powers, he can punch holes through the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:27.280
cockroaches’ bodies and kill them in one go. Jen&nbsp;
does the same and turns into a desert Locust that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:32.400
can jump up to ninety stories high, while Mina&nbsp;
transforms into a praying mantis that can slash&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:37.280
the cockroaches into pieces. The team battles&nbsp;
the cockroaches and kills them in no time. 
&nbsp;

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:42.000
The scene changes to the doctor calling someone.&nbsp;
The phone is picked up by one of the cockroaches&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.520
on Mars. Unlike other cockroaches, it can&nbsp;
speak Japanese and communicate with the doctor.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:53.200
He warns the insect not to get close to Komachi,&nbsp;
once he transforms because his insect is extremely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:58.560
dangerous. After ending the call, the cockroach&nbsp;
goes inside the ship BUGS2 and re-circulates&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:04.800
its oxygen. Then, the creature’s body tears down&nbsp;
the middle and emerges a transformed Asuka from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:08.880
inside. The team had thought that she was dead,&nbsp;
but it turns out that she was on the doctor’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:13.920
side the whole time. Her unique power after being&nbsp;
injected is that she has the ability to control&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:19.920
the cockroaches’ minds like an emerald cockroach&nbsp;
wasp. So, she manipulated the insects to go&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:25.120
against each other and survived. She then kills&nbsp;
the captain and pours water into Ichiro’s body.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:30.480
Ichiro, too, has been in the plan since the&nbsp;
beginning. His body has transformed into the Asian&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:37.200
coronamide, a creature who can survive in&nbsp;
extreme conditions and only needs water to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:42.160
reactivate. The doctor has assigned them on a&nbsp;
mission to bring a cockroach egg back on earth,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:46.320
so the Japanese government can breed them&nbsp;
and use them to strengthen their military.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:50.720
This was their prime mission and the cockroach&nbsp;
eliminating mission was just a decoy. 
&nbsp;

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:54.480
Ichiro and Asuka then take off the&nbsp;
ship with the egg in it. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:54.480 --> 00:10:00.400
the egg starts to hatch midway and gives birth to&nbsp;
two evolved cockroaches. Asuka tries to use her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:04.960
power to control them, but it doesn’t work. The&nbsp;
creatures are far more evolved from the others,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:09.840
making them the most powerful ones of them all.&nbsp;
They kill Asuka and call their own kind for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:14.640
help. The cockroaches on the surface hear the&nbsp;
call and flap their wings to fly to the ship.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:19.840
When a swarm of cockroaches latches onto the ship,&nbsp;
it starts to malfunction and crash beside BUGS1. 
&nbsp;

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:24.000
The evolved cockroaches come out of&nbsp;
the ship and order the others to attack&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.480
Komachi and the group. Komachi injects&nbsp;
himself with the other dose of the drug,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:32.640
speeding his evolution. They do not have much&nbsp;
difficulty fighting the normal cockroaches,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:37.760
but the evolved ones are hard to defeat. One&nbsp;
of them kills Mina after ripping her arm off.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:42.720
Jin injects himself with the second dose of the&nbsp;
drug while Komachi is on his third dose. 
&nbsp;

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:46.880
With their heightened powers, they kill more&nbsp;
cockroaches rapidly. However, the creatures&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:52.240
are nowhere near backing down. Jin injects&nbsp;
himself yet again and develops a pair of wings.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:57.120
Now, the cockroaches fly in the sky and battle&nbsp;
him. They attack the two in waves and do not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:01.760
die down because of their number. Eventually, Jen&nbsp;
realizes that to defeat them, they should defeat&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:06.960
the evolved leaders. He injects himself multiple&nbsp;
times with the drug, speeding his transformation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:12.080
and making it irreversible with every dose. After&nbsp;
that, he kicks one of the leaders and knocks his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:17.920
head off with immense power. But now, he has used&nbsp;
all his powers and cannot fight anymore. Komachi&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:22.800
tries defending Jin from the other leader but is&nbsp;
defeated easily. Before the leader can kill them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:28.000
a magical glowing creature comes flying towards&nbsp;
them. It spreads glowing dust all around as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:33.440
everyone looks at it in awe. The flying creature&nbsp;
is Nanao, who has evolved into her final form. 
&nbsp;

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:39.280
Komachi flies towards Nanao, but before he can get&nbsp;
her, one of the cockroaches fires at him. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:44.560
the dust Nanao had spread turns out to be tiny&nbsp;
explosives that cause a chain of explosions,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:49.120
taking all the cockroaches with them. Jin&nbsp;
flies away before the explosion can get him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:53.600
and saves Komachi just in time.&nbsp;
However, Nanao dies in the explosion.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:58.160
Sometime later, Komachi wakes up and sees&nbsp;
Jin has completely turned into an insect.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:04.400
Jin asks Komachi to go to earth without him as&nbsp;
this is his new life now. Komachi obliges and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:09.520
makes his way to the ship. Before he can reach&nbsp;
inside, he sees that the leader is still alive.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:14.720
He punches the weak cockroach but spares his&nbsp;
life out of kindness. Inside the ship, he finds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:20.160
Ichiro still alive. Ichiro saves Komachi’s&nbsp;
life by shooting the cockroach behind him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:25.440
The two then finally launch the escape pod and fly&nbsp;
away to earth as the cockroaches watch them. 
&nbsp;

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:29.520
Back on earth, the doctor notices that&nbsp;
Ichiro has hacked into their system and is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:33.920
broadcasting the whole encounter worldwide.&nbsp;
The doctor’s assistant starts to panic,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:38.960
now that the Japanese government’s secret is being&nbsp;
revealed to the world. However, the doctor seems&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:43.280
calm and says that he will sell all the BUGS’s&nbsp;
data to other governments of the world that are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:48.240
willing to buy them. The assistant points her&nbsp;
gun at the doctor as she turns out to be a spy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:52.960
for the Japanese government. But the doctor is&nbsp;
already ready for the attack, dodging the bullet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:57.360
with a protective barrier. He then kills the&nbsp;
assistant with a poison that was inserted in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:02.400
the lab in the case of an emergency. Back in&nbsp;
the spaceship, Ichiro vows to expose everyone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:07.360
involved in the mission. When asked what he wants&nbsp;
to do when he gets back to earth, Komachi replies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:12.880
that he will make tombs in the memory of everyone&nbsp;
who died, and then come back to Mars again.
