00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:02.330
Hi, Mystery Recapped here.

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:06.470
Today, I'm going to explain the American drama
thriller film called “Us.”

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:07.740
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.184
Watch out and take care!

00:00:13.456 --> 00:00:16.199
It is 1896 in Santa Cruz.

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.130
Addy is out with her parents at a carnival
at Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk.

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.419
She looks around the carnival...noticing various
activities going around her.

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:28.329
Her mother is going to the bathroom, while
her father is playing a game.

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:31.710
Addy is left unattended, so she wanders off
to look around.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.989
First, she goes to a beach by the carnival;
then she enters a funhouse.

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:39.680
The lights suddenly go out ,and Addy is stuck
in a house of mirrors.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.489
Suddenly, she encounters her doppelganger.

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:48.039
Cut to the present day, a family of four drives
to Santa Cruz, California.

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:52.770
Addy is now all grown up, and is the mother
of two kids, Zora and Jason.

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.289
After hours of journey, they arrive at Addy's
childhood home in Santa Cruz.

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:01.460
At lunch, Gabe Wilson, her husband, insists
on going to the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.090
that night for fun.

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.570
Addy remembers to this day what that night
at the funhouse had done to her.

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.350
She is haunted by memories of the encounter
and her recovery, during which she stopped

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.040
speaking for a while.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.070
She doesn’t want to go there again...but
Gabe successfully persuades her.

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.270
The family then drives to the beach.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.510
On their way to the beach, they are having
fun in their car.

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.220
Zora makes fun of Jason’s magic fire ring.

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:29.100
At one point, they witness paramedics taking
away a body of an old man, with blood on his chest

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.960
As they arrive at the beach, they meet their
friends: Josh Tyler, Kitty Tyler, and their

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.350
twin daughters.

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.140
As the two families are relaxing, Jason goes
to the bathroom.

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.890
While returning, he is shocked to see a man
who looks similar to the dead man they had

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.470
seen earlier.

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.530
Addy notices Jason missing and gets very scared.

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.740
When she finally finds Jason, they decide
to return home.

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.470
At night, Addy tells Gabe about her encounter
with her doppelganger when she was young.

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.300
However, Gabe doesn’t seem to believe her.

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.330
As they talk, the lights go out.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:06.660
Suddenly, Jason arrives and tells his parents
about a family standing in their driveway.

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.079
They look through the window and see a family
of four standing there.

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:11.610
Zora comes out too.

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.019
Addy freaks out and calls the police, as Gabe
goes out to tell them to go away.

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:18.980
But the family doesn’t answer, and just
stands there.

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.760
Gabe takes a baseball bat and goes out again.

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.329
This time, they start walking towards him.

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:27.560
He feels threatened, so he comes inside and
locks the doors.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.569
However, the people outside find a hidden
key and come inside.

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:35.480
The family is surprised to notice that the
intruders are their doppelgangers.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.349
They corner the family in their own living
room...threatening them with scissors.

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:40.939
They make them sit in front of them.

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:46.219
Jason’s doppelganger is Pluto...who loves
fire; Zora’s double is a sadist named Umbrae;

00:02:46.219 --> 00:02:50.180
Gabe’s double is Abraham; and the group
leader seems to be Addy’s double...named

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.180
Red.

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.769
She is the only one who can speak ,and has
a guttural and raspy voice.

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:58.780
Red tells them that they are the Wilson family's
shadow, and are called "the Tethered".

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.129
The tethered share a soul with their lookalike
counterparts and have been living as their

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:04.019
shadows their whole life.

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:07.030
But now, they have come to "untether" themselves.

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.499
Red tells them a story about a girl and her
shadow...referring to herself and Addy.

00:03:11.499 --> 00:03:15.499
While Addy ate good and warm food, Red had
to eat raw blooded rabbits.

00:03:15.499 --> 00:03:19.920
Addy was given soft toys to play with, while
Red’s toys were sharp and cold.

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.989
Addy met Gabe, her loving prince, but Red
had to marry Abraham because he was tethered

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:25.010
to Gabe.

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:30.389
Similarly, Addy gave birth to a loving daughter,
Zora, but Red gave birth to a sadistic monster,

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:31.389
Umbrae.

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:35.680
At last, she says that Addy had doctors to
operate on her and help her birth, but Red

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.599
had to do it all herself.

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:40.349
Red has come to despise Addy and her perfect
life.

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:44.000
So, they have come out of the shadows to claim
their life.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.720
After explaining, Red makes Addy handcuff
herself to the table.

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.319
Abraham drags Gabe away to the other room.

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:55.560
Umbrae chases Zora through the streets...while
Pluto forces Jason to play with him.

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.290
The intruders’ plan is to separate the Wilsons,
terrorize them, and kill them.

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:04.890
Pluto and Jason are playing with fire in a
tiny room... where Jason sees Pluto’s scarred

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.159
face for the first time.

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:09.090
Zora is hunted down by Umbrae.

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:13.150
As she is about to stab her with a pair of
scissors, a man stops her.

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.879
Zora runs away as Umbrae stabs the man to
death.

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:19.860
Meanwhile, Abraham hits Gabe, making him go
unconscious.

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:22.590
He then puts him in a garbage bag and into
the boat.

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:27.010
Gabe tears a tiny hole in the bag and notices
the baseball bat beside Abraham.

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:28.980
The boat suddenly stops.

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:33.260
Taking this opportunity, Gabe comes out of
the bag and hits Abraham with the bat, sending

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:34.680
him into the water.

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.370
But as the boat starts moving, Gabe falls
in the water as well.

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.930
Gabe sees the boat stop and climbs on top
of it.

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.810
Just then, Abraham attacks him from behind
but he pushes him back to the water and kills

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:46.810
him.

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:48.810
Gabe then takes the boat towards the house.

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:52.780
Meanwhile, Jason realizes that Pluto mirrors
his actions.

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:56.810
He distracts Pluto with his fire ring and
manages to run out and lock him inside the

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:57.810
room.

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:59.370
Red hears the noise.

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:01.970
She goes in and unlocks the door for Pluto.

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:03.750
She looks around the house for Jason.

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:07.190
Then, she finds Addy’s old stuffed toy and
cuts its head off.

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:12.100
Addy is still cuffed to the table, but she
notices a fireplace poker nearby.

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:15.160
She manages to grab it and free herself of
the cuffs.

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.610
She then finds Jason and runs out of the house.

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:20.160
They find Zora in their driveway.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.530
Gabe comes there with his boat at the right
time.

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:25.830
The family immediately gets on it and manages
to escape.

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:30.090
Elsewhere, the Tyler family is in their home
when Kitty hears a noise.

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:31.740
She tells Josh to check what it is.

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:36.840
All of a sudden, their doppelgangers appear
and kill the family within seconds.

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.090
Just then, the Wilsons arrive there.

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:41.410
Addy asks Josh’s double for help.

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:45.460
When he opens the door for her, she realizes
that it isn't him, and hits him in the head

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.100
with the fireplace poker.

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:50.210
However, It does little to no harm to him.

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:53.050
Others from inside, drag Addy in as well.

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:56.820
Gabe and the kids are outside when imposter
Josh walks towards them.

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:01.200
The kids run away as Gabe runs in the opposite
direction to divert Josh’s attention.

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:04.370
The kids then go inside the house to look
for their mother.

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:06.570
Zora picks a golf club as a weapon.

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:10.390
As they hear Addy screaming from upstairs,
they go up and see the twins’ dead bodies

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:15.030
lying on the floor... as the doppelganger
twins play in the background.

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:18.110
Suddenly, one of them appears in front of
Zora.

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:21.070
She hits her with the bat...making her fall
down the railings.

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:24.350
Next, they are attacked by the other twin.

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:26.390
After a little fight, Zora kills her too.

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:30.180
Kitty’s double is in the bedroom where she
has tied Addy to the bed.

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:33.700
Meanwhile, Gabe runs to the boat and Josh
follows him there.

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:37.220
Gabe then shoots Josh with a flare gun and
attacks him to death.

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:40.090
Kitty sees Gabe killing Josh through the window.

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:43.750
Just then, Zora attacks her from behind, but
Kitty dodges it.

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:48.650
She is about to stab Zora... but Jason saves
her by hitting Kitty on her head.

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:52.390
The Wilsons sit in the living room and try
to comprehend the situation.

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:54.780
The nine one one lines are all busy.

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:58.830
They look at the news and realize that this
has been happening all around the country.

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:03.180
The news says that the doppelgangers are coming
out of the sewers with scissors as weapons.

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:06.500
They are mindlessly stabbing people to death
throughout the country.

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:10.480
They see that the doubles are joining hands
to form a massive human chain after they have

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:11.600
killed their counterparts.

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:15.150
It is as if they have been planning this for
months.

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:18.950
Since the whole country is in attack, Addy
decides to drive along the coast and escape

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:20.320
to Mexico.

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:24.080
As the family gets into the car, Umbrae appears
in front of them.

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:27.340
Zora tries to hit her with the car but Umbrae
jumps onto it.

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:31.320
Zora then stops the car abruptly, sending
her flying into a tree where she is impaled

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:33.000
on a tree branch.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.230
The family then flees from the scene.

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:37.130
They see several dead bodies on their way.

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:40.370
They are stopped by a car burning in the middle
of the road.

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:43.820
Jason’s double, Pluto, appears there.

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:46.490
Addy goes out to fight him while the others
stay in the car.

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:49.880
Soon, Jason realizes that this is actually
a trap.

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:52.560
Pluto intends to ignite the family’s car.

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.890
He tells everyone else to get out of it.

00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:59.430
Before Pluto can light the match, Jason remembers
that the doppelgangers mirror their movements,

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:01.410
so he starts walking backward.

00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:03.710
This makes Pluto walk backward too.

00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:08.020
In the end, Pluto reaches the burning car
and burns to death himself.

00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:11.680
But just then, Red comes out of her hiding
and kidnaps Jason.

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:13.330
Addy runs after them.

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:17.300
She sees the long human chain of doppelgangers
standing across the beach.

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:20.660
She then reaches the place she had entered
all those years earlier.

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:24.180
She walks around it and finds a door that
leads somewhere downstairs.

00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:26.200
A rabbit comes out of the door.

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:28.710
She goes down and discovers a huge place.

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:30.880
It looks like a secret establishment.

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:35.529
She goes down an elevator and enters a huge
hallway with several rooms on either side.

00:08:35.529 --> 00:08:38.080
Many rabbits run around the hallway.

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:41.370
She finds Red in one of the rooms that appear
to be a classroom.

00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:44.430
The doppelganger human chain is drawn on the
board.

00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:46.480
Addy asks her where her son is.

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:49.709
But Red starts blabbering about how they are
human as well.

00:08:49.709 --> 00:08:52.620
She then reveals the secret of their existence.

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:56.699
Red explains that "the Tethered", also called
the Shadows, are actually artificial beings

00:08:56.699 --> 00:09:01.519
created by the government to control the originals
on the surface for their own twisted purposes.

00:09:01.519 --> 00:09:04.990
The project aimed at creating clones that
were connected to the people through their

00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:05.990
souls.

00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:09.639
The purpose of this project was to use the
clones to control people like puppets all

00:09:09.639 --> 00:09:11.170
over America.

00:09:11.170 --> 00:09:15.470
But the experiments failed, and the Tethered
were abandoned underground for generations,

00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:19.970
mindlessly mimicking the actions of their
counterparts and surviving on rabbit meat.

00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:22.959
That night, faith had brought Red and Addy
together.

00:09:22.959 --> 00:09:25.740
The other quickly realized that Red was different.

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:27.740
So they selected her as their leader.

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:30.420
They planned this for years.

00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:33.899
They wanted vengeance on their counterparts
but more than that, they wanted to create

00:09:33.899 --> 00:09:35.570
a statement of their existence.

00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:38.959
Hence, they decided to form the human chain.

00:09:38.959 --> 00:09:43.370
After Addy’s encounter with Red, her parents
had admitted her to a ballet dance class.

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:46.509
So, Red used to mimic Addy and dance too.

00:09:46.509 --> 00:09:49.399
According to her, dancing was the reason that
saved her.

00:09:49.399 --> 00:09:52.430
Then, they start to "fight" in the form of
ballet.

00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:55.269
Red graciously dodges all of Addy’s attacks.

00:09:55.269 --> 00:09:57.279
She has the upper hand in the fight.

00:09:57.279 --> 00:10:02.529
Red runs through the hallways...as Addy follows
her with the fireplace poker in her hand.

00:10:02.529 --> 00:10:06.660
Their fight grows more and more intense; suddenly
Red leaps at Addy with a pair of scissors

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:07.670
from behind.

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:11.890
But before she can get her, Addy stabs her
with the fireplace poker, killing her.

00:10:11.890 --> 00:10:15.790
As Red is on the verge of death, she whistles
the same tune Addy had heard the first time

00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:17.180
she met Red.

00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:22.220
This agitates Addy, so she strangles Red with
her handcuffs, and kills her maniacally.

00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:25.620
She then finds Jason hiding inside a locker
nearby.

00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:29.920
They both go outside, and find Gabe and Zora
hiding inside an ambulance.

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:32.759
The family then drives away in the same ambulance.

00:10:32.759 --> 00:10:36.589
As Addy drives, we see the flashback of the
night she met Red.

00:10:36.589 --> 00:10:38.670
Addy was face to face with Red.

00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:40.889
Red suddenly choked her unconscious.

00:10:40.889 --> 00:10:44.519
She had then dragged her down to her room
and handcuffed her to the bed.

00:10:44.519 --> 00:10:47.610
Red changed into Addy’s clothes and took
her place in real life.

00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:51.279
That night, Addy’s parents took home their
daughter’s doppelganger.

00:10:51.279 --> 00:10:55.120
This explains why Red is the only Tethered
who could talk and thought differently, leading

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:56.510
the revolt.

00:10:56.510 --> 00:11:01.649
Red’s voice is damaged because her double
choked her, damaging her larynx, and making

00:11:01.649 --> 00:11:03.680
her voice raspy and guttural.

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:07.970
This also clarifies why Addy, as a child,
wasn’t able to talk after she was found

00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:09.440
at the beach.

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:11.230
Shadows don’t know how to speak.

00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:16.249
Over time, Addy’s shadow learns to speak
and becomes a regular person...capable of

00:11:16.249 --> 00:11:18.639
love and laughter, and forgets that she is
a clone.

00:11:18.639 --> 00:11:23.600
The movie ends as we see a several miles-long
human chain formed by the doppelgangers.
