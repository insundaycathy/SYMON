00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.090
In the last scene of the first movie Shinichi
faced off the parasite residing inside his

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:10.410
mom's body he was able to claim victory and
both he and Migi survived the events of the

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.839
first part but what happened afterwards what
about the parasite army that has slowely been

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:16.960
established somewhere

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:22.410
in the shadows and what about the main antagonist
Gotou from the anime in this follow-up we

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.259
will conclude Shinichi's story and look what
could have been done to finish the job quicker

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:37.510
safer and possibly cooler
Let's get to the essentials the threats are

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.270
an army of parasites established with the
help of human mayor Takeshi Hirokawa

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.930
Then we have the sick parasite Gotou a parasite
with a body composed

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.449
of five different parasites he's especially

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:54.840
dangerous and pretty difficult to get rid
of but the most as always dangerous threat

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:01.160
of them all is stupid human interference it
is clear that every second we waste the parasites

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:07.290
gain in power everyday people get killed and
end up as parasite snacks at this point nobody

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:13.700
knows that the mayor Mr. Hirokawa, is secretly
a parasite admirer he believes that we humans

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:19.110
are the real parasites he despises us and
therefore wishes for a world where all humans

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:25.020
are subjected to parasite control that's all
cool and stuff but he should go f-k himself

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.560
I have to admit that infiltrating the government
was a brilliant move from the parasites especially

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.930
since most parasites are not competent enough
to mimic human emotions reliably so having

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.560
humans like Mr. Hirokawa on their side is
an insanely smart

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.259
move and makes me wanna fanboy for the completely

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:47.930
wrong group it comes as no surprise that there
will always be certain humans that take up

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:48.930
any

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.659
chance to go against their own species how
to beat those people well buy them gift cards

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:58.930
for therapies and/or books to antidote their
internal chaos anyway this dude must have

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:05.270
thought if I can beat 'em I might as well
join 'em and I do have to agree at least partly

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:11.060
but in my opinion joining the enemy so early
on is a far greater risk than staying low-key

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.140
and see how everything plays out at least
before making a potentially stupid decision

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:30.630
we've all seen Saroman's dismay this poor
old chap and this part of the story Shinichi

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.520
and Migi developed a friendship in their free
time they enjoy hunting down parasites, they

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.520
philosophize

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:41.470
about the meaning of life and even a cooking
session finds Its place every now and then

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.680
the movie makes it very clear that the loss
of his mother as well as the many lives that

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:51.150
were taken in the first part turned Shinichi
into a Japanese High School Batman which I

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:57.650
personally like a lot it doesn't take long
until we find out the Tamiya the schizophrenic

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:03.970
parasite/mother/mad scientist has convinced
a human journalist to shadow Migi and

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.780
Shinichi her intentions are entirely clear
in

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.980
the movie whether she's keeping an eye on

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:14.170
them out of something like Compassion or just
pure self-interest we don't really know

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.050
Her behavior is pretty ambiguous and while
she

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:19.250
doesn't really seem to be able to grasp how

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:24.750
to smile she definitely knows how to use her
human sex-appeal go figure But the key word

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:33.090
that I want to talk about is infiltration
if the parasites are gaining massive Advantage

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:38.640
by infiltrating human institutions like politics
and journalism then it should be clear that

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:44.680
we as humans should proceed similarly just
like Tamiya put a journalist onto Shinichi

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:45.680
and Migi

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.690
we should be putting a journalist onto Tamiya
she frequently meets up with the other higher-ups

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.730
inside the parasite imperium.

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:57.140
Indicating who is pulling the strings is of
crucialy importance if we are serious about

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:03.130
winning this fight it is true that the parasites
are able to freely shapeshift their appearance

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:08.121
which could make this whole mission a little
bit problematic but Mr. Hirokawa is human

00:04:08.121 --> 00:04:13.340
and therefore very prone to detection note
that this endeavor can only be performed with

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:19.340
human support any parasite would be detected
instantly the obvious goal of this approach

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:24.780
would be to eradicate the parasites as quick
and as efficient as possible but don't get

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:31.470
me wrong I could watch Shinichi and Migi systematically
hunt down parasites all day long but it just

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:32.470
isn't

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:38.340
very productive + it is potentially dangerous
If he's serious about killing all parasites

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:43.310
to establish general safety again and he needs
a more widespread approach and no I'm not

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:48.160
talkin about nukes here so instead of proving
the journalist that fell for Tamiya that she

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:53.430
indeed is a parasite too and then leaving
him behind just like that Shinichi should

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:58.340
have considered to work with them together
he should have ensured his safety until he

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:03.730
as a human journalist could find and deliver
evidence backed proof covering everything

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:09.120
about the parasites in charge he could have
easily handed this prove to the police without

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:14.230
necessarily revealing Shinichi's power this
would have ensured a large-scale government

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:19.970
operation and the parasitic threat could have
been completely eradicated within mere days

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:23.180
many of you have hinted that in the anime
Migi has threatened

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:25.760
Shinichi if he were to reveal anything about

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:31.620
his condition the movie follows a slightly
different pace at this point Migi has already

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:37.200
become much more approachable and sensitive
to Shinichi's desires Satomi and Shinichi

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:38.200
are on better

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:42.980
terms again after all that has happened in
the first part they do a good job in comforting

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:48.020
each other which I believe to be very important
emotionally after all they both went through

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:53.540
quite some stuff however it still gives me
anxiety seeing Satomi roaming around freely

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:58.650
completely not knowing about the psychopathic
mutant parasites out there that will hijack

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:03.520
your brain and eat it like a six-year-old
devours his Slurpee especially Shinichi's

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:08.480
decision to neglect the truth and not come
forward with it bothers me a lot there are

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:14.700
only two logical options yet he doesn't go
for neither firstly staying away from her

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:19.810
completely this would allow her to stay safe
in so far that she wouldn't become a Target

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:24.889
by being around Shinichi who can constantly
be sensed by random parasites at any given

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:25.889
moment

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:30.340
the downside on the other hand would be that
he can't actively intervene if she

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:35.440
should randomly be attacked by any of those
sick f-ks it would be easy to convince her

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:40.410
to stay away from you and not be an unnecessary
burden while you are fighting against the

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:45.320
parasite army hiding her somewhere up in the
mountains of hokkaido should perhaps suffice

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:51.620
to keep a relatively safe at least temporarily
it's cliche but it does work being rational

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:57.070
about stuff rather than emotional is always
preferable in dangerous situations and to

00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:02.930
be adequately rational requires to be as honest
as one can be by the way this would have also

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:05.860
saved his mother in the previous part but
many

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:08.169
of you have pointed out Migi actively blocked

00:07:08.169 --> 00:07:14.830
that option by threatening Shinichi you see
honesty pays out but sometimes the only answer

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:21.040
is brute force in our next scene Shinichi
gets followed by five parasites at the same

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:22.180
time.

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:27.560
The hardcore fans out there know exactly what
this means we are about to face Gotou the

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:33.630
sick lab rat who's body is composed of five
different parasites Gotou is basically comparable

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:39.630
to an octopus and let's be honest here parasites
and octopuses have a lot in common no matter

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:46.300
how you look at it an Octopus has 3 hearts,
9 brains and blue blood which is freaking

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:51.720
awesome if you ask me and at least as alien
as any of those parasites what it means to

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:56.580
have nine brains well I don't know but in
the case of Gotou we do need to kill each

00:07:56.580 --> 00:08:02.030
parasite residing in his body to completely
wipe him out one of the problematic aspects

00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:07.919
of Gotou's existence besides is 5 lives is
his tendency to be five times more aggressive

00:08:07.919 --> 00:08:12.120
and bloodthirsty than solo parasites running
away makes sense

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:20.211
but a future encounter can't be avoided so

00:08:20.211 --> 00:08:25.389
gathering as much information about him as
possible could be worth it nevertheless in

00:08:25.389 --> 00:08:30.710
the movie Shinichi and Migi try to avoid direct
confrontation and run away but they eventually

00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:36.979
decide to face Gotou directly there are multiple
things to mention here but first of all how

00:08:36.979 --> 00:08:42.140
dare you to run away from this bloodthirsty
parasite whose head you've just decapitated

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:43.140
while

00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:47.650
a group of young women is coming for a stroll
in the park it's like nobody has any chance

00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:54.110
against that monster but you in a radius of
about 2 million miles so running away I don't

00:08:54.110 --> 00:09:00.000
know man seems a bit irresponsible to me furthermore
you've just beheaded the most powerful parasite

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.060
out there that should motivate you a little
bit more a chance like this won't presents

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:10.560
itself anymore that easily and with Shinichi's
parasitic Powers he could have easily finished

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:22.290
the job shout out to Columbus from Zombieland
if you ain't sure you better hit it twice

00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:26.460
Shinichi should have known better because
of the exact same mistake his mom got killed

00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:31.150
in the first part meanwhile the journalist
who has ventured out on his own to expose

00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:37.110
the parasites left by Mr. Hirokawa became
too much of a threat and therefore a target

00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:41.790
I have mentioned how this could have been
avoided if he cooperated with Shinichi or

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:46.870
other big forces rather than trying to set
things straight on his own especially since

00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:53.070
he's only human and therefore no match for
any parasite I understand that he is an investigative

00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:58.270
journalist and has a certain type of temperament
usually those people are very brave people

00:09:58.270 --> 00:10:03.710
who can put the truth about anything else
which is admirable but Mr. Kuramori is also

00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:09.300
a single father of a young girl his most important
duty therefore would have been to keep his

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:14.850
daughter safe no matter what So, before making
any moves, he should made sure that his daughter

00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:17.100
was out of reach for any parasites.

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:21.190
That would have been easily achievable in
just a few short days.

00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:26.350
Furthermore, he had already met Shinichi before
and knew that he is a kind and supportive

00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:27.350
character.

00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:32.420
He would have most likely helped him out,
or at least ensured the safety of his daughter.

00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:37.860
but he didn't plan anything and jumped into
the mess without making any preparations which

00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:43.920
is reckless and stupid to say the least especially
when you think about his daughter when the

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:49.450
parasites attacked his household he was shopping
for groceries of course his wife has passed

00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:54.480
away not too long ago so his daughter stayed
home alone and became the latest in theory

00:10:54.480 --> 00:11:07.089
avoidable victim of the parasites I can't
imagine how that feels but it must suck knowing

00:11:07.089 --> 00:11:11.970
that you had the chance to avoid this but
even if he did take measurements and kept

00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:17.580
her somewhere safe he was very likely to meet
his death anyway after all he was picking

00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:23.240
a fight with the parasites that his daughter
got killed though was not necessary and I'll

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:33.010
explain why His rate of survival was slim
to begin with, no matter how you look at it.

00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:37.709
But as a father, I would have expected him
to prepare certain things in case of his death

00:11:37.709 --> 00:11:40.920
– which, again was likely to happen.

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:42.940
He didn’t do anything of that sort.

00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:48.170
This bears the question: Who would have taken
care of the girl in case of his death?

00:11:48.170 --> 00:11:53.291
If he didn’t have an answer to this question,
then he would not have ventured out, and if

00:11:53.291 --> 00:11:57.850
he did have a solution, then he would have
placed her save first and instructed those

00:11:57.850 --> 00:12:01.220
in charge what to do in case he won’t return.

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:07.050
This leads me to my next conclusion Mr. Kuramori
was thoughtless and too rash in his actions

00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:12.649
which led to his daughter's death if you wanna
recklessly throw away your life be my guest

00:12:12.649 --> 00:12:17.800
but if there are people around you who rely
on your well-being then you should think carefully

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:23.490
what you are going to do next if for some
reason you just have to go and risk your life

00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:29.040
because of your believes or whatever then
that's completely fine but you must think

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:35.120
and prepare a safety net for those relying
on you in case you don't make it back

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:45.100
the identity of the parasites and Mr. Hirokawa's
involvement leaked out the government started

00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:50.600
a huge action plan to identify the threat
and get rid of them one by one looking at

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:53.560
these scenes I don't think they need any help
or inputs

00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:56.500
from a YouTuber on how to beat those parasites

00:12:56.500 --> 00:13:02.170
their efficiency is on another level how about
we temporarily switch sides and try to beat

00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:08.279
this big-scale government intervention instead
hell yeah what they do is they systematically

00:13:08.279 --> 00:13:13.610
screen a batch of people and identify the
parasites among them if they find one well

00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:24.810
then this is what happens I love how does
Japanese SWAT member can't help but be polite

00:13:24.810 --> 00:13:28.990
when sending a parasite into its death that's
some cold blooded s***

00:13:28.990 --> 00:13:33.930
in the first scenes of his grand plan we have
seen that there are countless heavily armored

00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:39.870
Special Forces with plenty of backup they
use big caliber shotguns to blast away anything

00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:45.980
in front of it they know what's up but as
a parasite and especially as a group of a

00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:51.779
few dozen parasites this situation shouldn't
be too much of a threat if you think it through

00:13:51.779 --> 00:13:56.500
the simplest way to ensure your safety here
would be to take these hundreds of people

00:13:56.500 --> 00:14:03.120
as hostages as a parasite you are able to
cut people in half and mere seconds so you

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:08.640
would have had plenty of time to react accordingly
it would have required some organizational

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:13.920
skills but with the help with our high-profile
politician Hirokawa this should not have been

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:19.580
an issue I give him a thumbs down for the
effort taking hostages would have ensured

00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:20.580
your safety

00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:25.950
temporarily but how could you possibly get
out of there if I were a parasite I would

00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:31.580
have shape-shifted myself into one of the
human hostages if we were a group of let's

00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:38.790
say 24 parasites I would have divided us into
four groups of each 6 parasites and then shape-shift

00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:44.769
into one human per group then I would have
told the hostages to run out with us pretending

00:14:44.769 --> 00:14:51.060
to be a parasite too if they declined or yelled
out the truth once outside well they would

00:14:51.060 --> 00:15:02.279
have ended up 6 ft deep pretty quickly
Mr. Kuramori is going nuts can't blame me

00:15:02.279 --> 00:15:08.350
for it but oh boy is it not his fault he managed
to kidnap Tamiya's baby and took it for a

00:15:08.350 --> 00:15:15.440
casual stroll inside the local zoo I guess
he called her over to reason with her.. or

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:18.459
explain why exactly is doing what it's doing?

00:15:18.459 --> 00:15:21.400
I don't know
but it seems like there isn't anything more

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:26.529
dangerous than a desperate parent
Tamiya makes the case that the parasites and

00:15:26.529 --> 00:15:32.220
humans can live together as one family which
is all beautiful and stuff but unfortunately

00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:38.460
impossible if the parasites transform human
brains into protein shakes the only way for

00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:44.340
parasites and humans to peacefully coexist
would be in form of Shinichi and Migi that

00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:49.510
could be actually beneficial for both entities
but it would come along with many more questions

00:15:49.510 --> 00:15:52.620
and difficulties that I won't mention in this
video

00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:57.870
in the following scenes a few interesting
things happen first of Mr. Kuramori gets killed

00:15:57.870 --> 00:16:02.490
by Tamiya before he can throw the baby into
its death like a spartan and getting rid of

00:16:02.490 --> 00:16:08.020
a baby with imperfections afterwards Tamiya
saves her baby while she's getting shot

00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:13.160
by the police countless times something that
should not have been possible according to

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:19.910
the nature of parasites she sacrificed herself
to save a human this proves that she put in

00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:25.970
the effort more so than the humans to understand
us and use this understanding to adjust herself

00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:31.459
I have to give her props for that
before she dies she hands over her baby Shinichi

00:16:31.459 --> 00:16:36.420
and wishes all of them the best
I guess after all she was nothing less than

00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:42.029
something thrown into a chaotic world with
no answers anywhere to be found she's basically

00:16:42.029 --> 00:16:48.480
a modern parasitic philosopher concerned with
the questions of ontology I liked her.

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:49.480
RIP

00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:54.310
At the same time it turns out that all Special
Forces back at the town hall were annihilated

00:16:54.310 --> 00:17:00.079
they managed to kill each parasite apart from
Gotou which as we all know would not have

00:17:00.079 --> 00:17:03.880
been the case if Shinichi didn't procrastinate
halfway through the movie

00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:09.299
Now, say what you want about the live-action
Gotou but he is freaking cool.

00:17:09.299 --> 00:17:14.230
He looks straight like a subject from a secret
underground lab owned by Orochimaru.

00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:15.360
Shinichi escapes.

00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:18.709
He knows he’s no match for Gotou and that
is scary.

00:17:18.709 --> 00:17:23.799
If he can’t take him out and nobody else
can, then how do we get the job done?

00:17:23.799 --> 00:17:30.620
Gotou seemingly can’t be harmed by anything
physical since his shield is basically impenetrable.

00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:34.450
But those who have watched the anime know
that there are certain ways to get rid of

00:17:34.450 --> 00:17:35.909
parasites.

00:17:35.909 --> 00:17:41.320
First of all, each parasite is dependent on
their internal organs – just like humans.

00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:46.190
Meaning if there’s a way to damage those,
especially the heart for instance, the parasite

00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:49.419
would not be able to survive just like we
as humans

00:17:49.419 --> 00:17:50.880
could not either.

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:56.470
To injure Gotou though is a little difficult
since he’s very capable in hardening his

00:17:56.470 --> 00:17:58.169
parasite skin.

00:17:58.169 --> 00:18:02.639
One of the few possibilities would be to injure
him through bigger detonations.

00:18:02.639 --> 00:18:07.870
But even with this, it isn’t entirely guaranteed
that he couldn’t defend himself against

00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:09.190
that too.

00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:12.210
Another plausible way would be to poison him.

00:18:12.210 --> 00:18:18.340
This would do the job relatively quickly and
doesn’t necessarily require a direct hit.

00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:22.480
Shinichi doesn’t have time to think
about all of that and runs into a forest.

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:24.850
He knows that he can’t defeat him.

00:18:24.850 --> 00:18:30.240
And so Migi comes up with a plan that requires
him to separate himself from Shinichi.

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:35.020
According to him, that way they can attack
from both sides giving them an advantage.

00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:37.799
But it is no help

00:18:37.799 --> 00:18:42.070
During this act of, let’s call it improvisation
Migi gets killed.

00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:46.019
My heart broke during this scene and I hoped
for a Migi return.

00:18:46.019 --> 00:18:50.830
But at the same time, I knew that this was
a Japanese production and therefore I knew

00:18:50.830 --> 00:18:51.830
that

00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:54.759
they would probably enjoy leaving us in despair
just like that.

00:18:54.759 --> 00:18:55.759
e.e

00:18:55.759 --> 00:18:59.299
Through sheer luck Shinichi escapes and hides
in a nearby storehouse.

00:18:59.299 --> 00:19:03.019
His girlfriend joins and plays the night nurse
for the time being.

00:19:03.019 --> 00:19:04.610
The rest is history.

00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:09.591
In the morning of the following day, Shinichi
gets yet again eyeballed from the side, this

00:19:09.591 --> 00:19:11.609
time by his arm stump.

00:19:11.609 --> 00:19:16.409
Being just as happy as I was watching this
scene, he quickly realized, for the first

00:19:16.409 --> 00:19:22.309
time during both movies, that Satomi is in
danger since he can be sensed by Gotou.

00:19:22.309 --> 00:19:23.309
DUH

00:19:23.309 --> 00:19:27.110
He leaves Satomi behind and escapes to the
local landfill.

00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:32.710
If I were to experience my last moments, this
is not the place that I would pick.

00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:37.340
Especially since running away from another
parasite, in that case even Gotou is pretty

00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:46.340
much impossible
The last showdown breaks out, which reminds

00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:50.299
me of the last scenes of the lord of the ring
trilogy.

00:19:50.299 --> 00:19:54.970
Shinichi without the powers of Migi has yet
to figure out a way to kill Gotou.

00:19:54.970 --> 00:20:00.499
But to me it looks more like he’s trying
to survive rather than actually win the battle.

00:20:00.499 --> 00:20:04.950
If this was me, I’d probably batista bomb
Gotou into the fire.

00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:09.989
But Shinichi comes up with some legit Matrix
moves instead and slides over the floor, grabs

00:20:09.989 --> 00:20:14.759
a piece of metal and stabs Gotou like he’s
never done anything else

00:20:14.759 --> 00:20:20.260
When Gotou strikes for the counter it seems
like Migi, in an extremely gross way joins

00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:21.600
Shinichi’s body again.

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:26.470
It turns out he waited in Gotous body for
the right time, to go back to Shinichi and

00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:28.450
save him one more time from death.

00:20:28.450 --> 00:20:33.210
They have a beautiful and quick, probably
pretty smelly reunion.

00:20:33.210 --> 00:20:37.070
And at the same time Gotou seems to be rather
unwell.

00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:42.149
We eventually learn from Migi that the metal
piece Shinichi pierced Gotou with had a chemical

00:20:42.149 --> 00:20:46.080
on it that poisoned Gotou and made his organs
shut down.

00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:50.369
This led to an internal fight of all parasites
residing in his body.

00:20:50.369 --> 00:20:55.279
Basically, their strong individual survival
instinct kicked in and the teamwork turned

00:20:55.279 --> 00:20:59.330
into a free for all that ultimately led to
his demise.

00:20:59.330 --> 00:21:04.860
Shinichi almost decided against killing Gotou
but Satomi suddenly appears, she watched the

00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:07.340
fight from the VIP cabin above.

00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:08.440
Lucky Girl.

00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:10.239
This convinced him otherwise.

00:21:10.239 --> 00:21:14.629
He understood that in order to keep those
he loves safe; he must finish the job.

00:21:14.629 --> 00:21:19.659
He picks Gotou’s corpse up, speaks a few
last words and throws it into the fire of

00:21:19.659 --> 00:21:21.610
the mount doom of landfills.

00:21:21.610 --> 00:21:28.609
So apparently poison is the way to go

00:21:28.609 --> 00:21:34.309
Always carry a few vials of deadly poison
and some metals shards perhaps even shuriken.

00:21:34.309 --> 00:21:39.119
Every time you face a parasite that is about
to jump you, throw that shit right into its

00:21:39.119 --> 00:21:40.119
face.

00:21:40.119 --> 00:21:41.230
Thanks for watching
