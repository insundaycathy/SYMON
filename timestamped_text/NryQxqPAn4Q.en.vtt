00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.240
Welcome back to Movie Recaps.

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:07.490
Today I will show you a horror, thriller,
war film from 2020, titled Ghosts of War.

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:08.680
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:10.500
Watch out and take care.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.429
In Nazi-occupied France at the end of WW2,
an American squadron of soldiers is seen sleeping

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:16.650
in the woods.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.320
One of them, Chris, has a nightmare and when
he wakes up he sees someone looking over them

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.029
from the adjacent tree.

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:26.249
The apparition keeps looking at Chris who
gets more unnerved and grabs at his pistol.

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:30.039
It cocks its own pistol which prompts Chris
to ask what it wants, expecting it to shoot

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:33.350
him, but when he reopens his eyes the apparition
has vanished.

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.390
The following morning, Chris and his squad
are preparing to leave for an outpost, where

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.390
they are expected to arrive.

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.580
Kirk is dealing with an insane rash from his
socks and asks Butchie if he has a spare pair,

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.560
only to be met by ridicule from both him and
Eugene.

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.410
The conversation ends with an argument between
Kirk and Eugene which gets interrupted by

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.410
Chris ordering the squad to move out.

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.740
During their walk to the outpost, the soldiers
hear an incoming jeep, then crouch down and

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.670
wait to ambush it with grenade launchers.

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.970
The jeep gets blown up by the squad and then
they go over to it to pick off the remaining

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:04.000
soldiers.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.090
Tappert takes out the SS patch from an officer
as a trophy and pulls one of his golden teeth

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:09.090
out.

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.290
Kirk kills a survivor from the explosion as
Butchie looks for maps and coded messages.

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.600
Kirk finds another survivor who seems to be
in better shape than the rest of his men.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.299
When they realize he's a major, Butchie decides
to box him, however, he doesn't seem too interested

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:25.409
and calls the others pigs for looting his
men's things.

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.060
Another survivor wakes up, and Butchie bashes
his head in which makes the major change his

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.009
mind about fighting so the two of them start
swinging punches at each other.

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:37.170
The nazi major seems to be a bit better in
hand-to-hand combat, so Chris comes over and

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.170
kills him.

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.079
Then, Chris turns to his men and orders them
to back up because he realized that they made

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:43.979
a wrong turn on the way.

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.289
Before they leave, Tappert also takes one
of the nazi's coats.

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:51.130
As they walk through the countryside, they
hear someone in the woods in front, so the

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.170
squad stops and waits until they see a group
of refugees come out of hiding.

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.969
The group continues on their journey and Tappert
runs out to them as a woman with a child waits

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:00.009
for him.

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:03.990
He gives her the coat, the gold teeth he has
collected, and the SS patch.

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.939
The squad continues their journey to the outpost
through flaming villages and the desolate

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:11.880
countryside when Chris tells them that the
outpost they are going to is actually a castle

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.900
that they have to safeguard.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.330
When they arrive at the castle, the squad
sees one of the other guards sleeping in a

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:18.810
jeep outside.

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.250
They wake him up and he immediately runs in,
calling to his men that they can finally leave.

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.530
The squad walks into the castle to see the
other men hurrying to get out of there as

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.110
soon as they can.

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.560
Before they leave, Butchie asks them to leave
their radio in the castle.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.060
Chris is suspicious about why they are in
such a hurry to leave since the place is so

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.830
nice and the commanding officer tells him
that some of them would like to make furlough,

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.350
so he lets them leave.

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.310
Later, the men are making lunch in the kitchen,
when Chris decides to take a look around the

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.060
house, something Eugene is already doing.

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.490
He finds a piano and sits down to play.

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:53.540
The music echoes through the empty castle
and all of its messed-up nooks and crannies.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.240
Chris walks inside the main study only to
find a massive burn mark on the floor where

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.850
the chair used to be and then he hears some
strange noises coming from the vents unable

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:02.700
to make out what they are.

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.080
Butchie hears someone in the bathroom and
goes to check on it, finding the door locked

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.650
and as he walks away, the door opens.

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.230
They all gather in the den later, eating and
relaxing, when they hear strange noises, prompting

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.690
them to get their weapons and check it out.

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.620
Tappert and Butchie take the main staircase
and check all the doors on the second floor.

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.911
Kirk and Chris hear the sound close to them,
but they can't make out what it is as they

00:03:22.911 --> 00:03:25.320
walk into a room with covered-up things.

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.701
They get to the kitchen and realize the noise
is coming from the other room and as they

00:03:28.701 --> 00:03:31.620
prepare to enter it, the doors abruptly open.

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.820
Both men continue to the other room when they
reach drapes cordoning out the next one.

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.430
Once they pull the drapes, Kirk and Chris
see someone hanging in front of the window,

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.360
who disappears when the wind blows the covers
away.

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.890
Later that night, the men sit in front of
the fire and tell each other ghost stories

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:49.070
while Tappert is looking out the windows through
his scope.

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:52.840
Eugene tells them about a journal he found
in the basement that belonged to an 18-year-old

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.400
nazi who took over the house.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.670
Suddenly, they all hear knocking noises coming
from the fireplace and Chris tells them that

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:03.200
it sounds like Morse code so Eugene deciphers
it into the sentence "I have no legs".

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.000
The sound stops abruptly.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.970
Chris orders his men to rest, but stay cautious.

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.430
He tells Tappert to take the attic because
it's the best vantage point to tell if someone

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:12.810
is coming.

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.190
Eugene is in the basement and he's trying
to open a chest, before giving up and sitting

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:17.310
down on it.

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.820
He sees a photo of the family that lived in
the castle and reads about them in the nazi

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.250
soldier's journal.

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.530
Suddenly, his candle goes out.

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:27.920
He tries his lighter as something appears
behind him for a moment and when he lights

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:32.210
the candle again, he sees that the family
has disappeared from the photo.

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:34.670
Tappert sets up with a rifle on the attic
window.

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:38.350
He takes a look through his scope when somebody
appears behind him in the room.

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:43.070
As he's observing through the scope he sees
a hanged man for a moment, then gone the next.

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:46.960
Tappert keeps looking when suddenly a ghost
boy appears right in front of his view, scaring

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:47.960
him.

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.580
There's a bang on the wardrobe behind him
too.

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.080
Tappert goes outside to check more closely
until he notices Chris staring at him from

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.780
inside the castle.

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:00.460
The next day, Eugene, Kirk, and Chris sit
on the balcony and talk about how fast the

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.120
previous squad wanted to get out of there.

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.530
Eugene tells the others a story about Tappert
that happened when they were in Paris.

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:11.340
He'd found Tappert sitting in a pool of blood,
surrounded by the carved-up bodies of 7 teenage

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.150
Hitler youth kids.

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:16.580
Tappert was sitting with a string in his hands
as if he were playing Cat's cradle with someone

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.640
and with a scary look in his eyes.

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:23.210
Chris says that he's glad Tappert is on their
side when he suddenly shows up on the balcony.

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:26.540
Tappert tells them that the last squad wanted
to get out of there because they heard a radio

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:31.270
transmission about 50 German soldiers passing
by the castle on their way to Strasburg.

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:35.230
He advises his comrades that they should hide
in the woods until they pass, but Chris thinks

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:37.390
they should safeguard the castle.

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:40.550
Tappert says that he'll go to the attic to
try to spot them in time and tells Eugene

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:41.850
to join him.

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:45.240
Once there, they begin to prepare it when
they find a pentagram on the floor under the

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:46.470
rug.

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:49.490
Eugene's theory is that the nazis must have
killed the people that lived in the house

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:53.620
in a ritualistic way, explaining it with Hitler's
obsession with the occult.

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:57.180
They don't discuss it further and begin moving
the wardrobe from one side of the room to

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:58.280
the other.

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:02.530
When the wardrobe touches the pentagram, its
door closes onto Eugene's fingers, breaking

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:03.530
them.

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:06.990
He thinks that Tappert did it on purpose and
pushes him toward the wardrobe.

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:10.470
When he looks into the mirror, he sees the
reflection of a hanged woman.

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:15.370
Later, Eugene, Chris, and Kirk listen to one
of the frequencies on the radio, when they

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:17.220
hear something extra eerie.

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:20.360
A woman's voice can be heard saying that they
are coming for them.

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:24.160
They all agree that the castle might be haunted
and Kirk suggests they should leave even before

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:25.600
the nazis come.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:29.660
Suddenly, Morse code can be heard coming from
the fireplace again.

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:33.580
Eugene deciphers it as "if you leave..." and
as he's writing something takes over his hand

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:35.930
and finishes the line with "...you will die".

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:40.260
That night, the squad prepares for the arrival
of the nazi troops, with Tappert in the attic

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:43.400
and the rest hiding behind a barricade near
the entrance.

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:46.900
When the nazi's get there Tappert spots them
and signals the rest while the troops gather

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:49.020
outside and surround the castle.

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:52.770
They try to enter, but since the doors are
locked they get back in their trucks and prepare

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:55.940
to leave when a loud banging noise from the
attic can be heard.

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:59.560
The nazis come back and begin to attack the
castle with Tappert only able to take one

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.389
of them out at a time.

00:07:01.389 --> 00:07:05.080
Suddenly, they throw a grenade in front of
the barricade and Butchie jumps on it, taking

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:06.330
its full hit.

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:10.550
Chris gets thrown across the room, so he gets
up dizzy and confused, but still shooting

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:12.530
whatever nazi he can see.

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:16.470
More nazis come inside and Chris runs to the
basement, hiding under the stairs and allowing

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:20.200
himself ample cover to sneakily attack the
officers following him.

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:23.770
Meanwhile, Eugene hides in the study when
he hears someone behind him and then strange

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:25.900
voices coming from the vent.

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:29.690
He gets his gun ready to shoot but when he
jumps from behind the desk he faces no nazi

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:32.310
but a ghost, that abruptly bursts into flames.

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:36.480
A German soldier finds Butchie's decimated
body in the hallway as well as a second one

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:37.990
lying next to him.

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:41.340
He checks the second body when Chris turns
and kills him and the two others that show

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:42.340
up.

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:46.380
Kirk is hiding in the bathroom when he hears
drowning noises and children's laughter.

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:49.930
He looks over to the tub and sees a nazi soldier
drowning in it.

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:53.590
Tappert hears something in the attic and follows
it, only to find a nazi hanging in the middle

00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:54.990
of the room.

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:58.880
The following morning, the squad is gathered
around Butchie, and consider giving him enough

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:01.540
morphine to end his suffering if necessary.

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:05.520
Chris orders them to take the bodies of the
nazis outside and when Eugene and Kirk bring

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:08.770
them over to the truck they are horrified
by the sight of what Tappert has done with

00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:09.770
them.

00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:13.710
Later, they talk about hauntings and ghosts
when Eugene suddenly figures out that everything

00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:17.230
they experienced in the house was something
that the nazis did to the family that lived

00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:18.470
in the castle.

00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:21.940
The family met a gruesome end the day the
nazis came to their home.

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:25.160
The father was burned alive, tied to a chair
in the study.

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:28.430
The son was drowned in front of his mother's
eyes and the daughter was hanged from the

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:30.130
rafters in the attic.

00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:34.680
Their bodies were never buried so Chris asks
if that's the reason why they became ghosts.

00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:36.540
Eugene goes to check on Butchie.

00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:40.320
While there, he gets scared by Tappert, who
joins him and tells him his version of the

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:42.810
Paris story with the Hitler youth.

00:08:42.810 --> 00:08:46.510
Eugene realizes that not everything can be
easily explained and that Tappert's story

00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:50.760
carries a different kind of weight which he
dug up when he reminded him of the story earlier.

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:54.880
Later, Chris has a nightmare about the tub,
in which a ghost appears to him and tries

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:56.200
to drown him.

00:08:56.200 --> 00:09:00.060
While being pulled into the water, he sees
three masked soldiers that turn into nurses

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:02.620
and back to soldiers, before he wakes up.

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:06.480
The next day, they tend to Butchie and talk
about leaving the castle, even in the face

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:09.230
of being court marshaled for leaving their

00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:12.570
Chris and Eugene go back to the basement to
search for anything that might have belonged

00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:14.080
to the family.

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:17.790
Eugene goes to find his lighter and Chris
finds the journal, only he sees that the pages

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:18.850
are empty.

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:22.620
When Eugene comes back he acts all ominously
about it then Kirk suddenly calls them to

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:23.940
come back.

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:27.060
Butchie is awake and keeps saying that "this
isn't real" and that "it was them".

00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:30.630
Before he dies, he grabs Chris and tells him
to remember.

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:34.630
That night, the remaining squad members discuss
leaving the castle again.

00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:38.270
Chris says that they should bury the bodies
of the family first and asks to see the journal

00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:39.880
to find information.

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:42.790
The pages are suddenly filled with writing
again.

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:46.180
Eugene tells him that he'll check the journal
for clues as to where the bodies are, but

00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:48.440
says that they should leave the castle first.

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:51.330
The boys bury Butchie in the garden before
they leave.

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:54.820
Walking back to base camp they see a trashed
ambulance on the road as well as the same

00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:57.030
group of refugees as before.

00:09:57.030 --> 00:10:00.660
They keep going further and talk about the
possibility of being trapped in the afterlife

00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:02.790
until they pass by a strange building.

00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:06.550
Later, they reach the same ambulance and decide
to turn around.

00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:09.980
The squad walks back through the destroyed
city they passed before and sleeps in the

00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:11.560
woods that night.

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:14.740
Tappert has a dream that he's being hanged
from the rafters in the attic, but he wakes

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:18.300
in the woods and sees the word "Vetrulek"
next to his sleeping bag.

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:22.480
The next day, the squad passes by the ambulance
again and when they turn around they are faced

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:25.060
with the bodies of the nazis they killed earlier.

00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:29.530
Eventually, they arrive back at the castle,
thinking that it won't let them leave.

00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:33.340
That night, Chris thinks that he can communicate
with the spirits and find out where they are

00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:34.370
buried.

00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:38.450
Tappert says the word "Vetrulek" and Eugene
remembers reading it in the nazi journal.

00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:42.120
It's an old Muslim curse, stating that if
you let evil happen it can come back to haunt

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:43.460
you tenfold.

00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:46.790
That night, the men wait for the ghosts to
show up and communicate.

00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:50.950
Footsteps appear before them and are headed
straight for Chris, stopping before him.

00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:54.920
He sees a ghost that grabs him and starts
dragging him to another part of the estate.

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:58.510
Chris begs them to shoot the ghost and even
though he can't see it, Tappert still shoots

00:10:58.510 --> 00:11:00.190
in the direction of the ghost.

00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:03.460
The others follow Chris to the other house
and when they enter something strange begins

00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:07.170
happening to them and they see images from
a different place and time, then they find

00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:09.399
Chris next to the bodies of the family.

00:11:09.399 --> 00:11:13.630
Later, the soldiers bury the bodies and find
the last page of the journal stuck to the

00:11:13.630 --> 00:11:14.920
father.

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:18.830
Eugene reads the last journal entry that says
that the family wasn't French, but an Afghan

00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:22.170
and that they risked their lives to save as
many Jews as they can.

00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:26.361
The page also says that the mother performed
a vetrulek curse on the nazi soldiers, haunting

00:11:26.361 --> 00:11:27.361
them to the grave.

00:11:27.361 --> 00:11:32.340
Later at the castle, Eugene remembers another
entry in the journal and reads it again, saying

00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:35.990
that the words have changed, now reading that
burying the bodies only gave the ghosts the

00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:37.950
power to return from the dead.

00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:41.520
Suddenly, the lights go out and as Tappert
sits in the middle of the pentagram on the

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:43.910
attic, the ghosts show up in the castle.

00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:47.720
They each attack one soldier and the men try
to combat and shoot them, but nothing works

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:48.950
against them.

00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:52.570
All of a sudden, the ghosts begin to glitch
and the mutilated body of Butchie appears

00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:54.710
to Chris, telling him that this isn't real.

00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:58.440
Then a ghost takes him to a mirror, telling
him to remember.

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:02.529
Chris wakes in the present, surrounded by
nurses and a doctor, then takes a look around

00:12:02.529 --> 00:12:05.029
the room and sees his fallen comrades.

00:12:05.029 --> 00:12:08.810
He pulls his covers away to see that he has
no legs and the doctor tells him that his

00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:10.910
memories will come back in a few moments.

00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:14.970
Chris begins to remember that he was actually
a soldier in Afghanistan and that his squad

00:12:14.970 --> 00:12:18.150
was supposed to save a doctor that was helping
the Americans.

00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:21.250
Their mission was to extract him to a safe
house in Kabul.

00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:25.089
In the present, the doctor tells him that
they are in a facility, hooked to a computer

00:12:25.089 --> 00:12:29.730
simulation made to help soldiers recover from
PTSD as their injuries heal.

00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:33.690
Chris goes into another memory where Tappert
is talking to two boys playing cat's cradle

00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:36.150
and giving one of them a toy meant for his
son.

00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:39.660
The squad enters the home and the contact
with the doctor tells the family that they

00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:43.560
have to leave immediately when he gets a message
that the extraction won't be possible since

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:45.820
enemy combatants are coming to the house.

00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:49.490
He tells the doctor to hide them in the wall,
but the squad doesn't want to leave the family

00:12:49.490 --> 00:12:52.420
to get slaughtered, though they still listen
to his orders.

00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:56.470
The enemy combatants arrive and immediately
begin voicing their suspicions about the doctor's

00:12:56.470 --> 00:12:59.160
possible collaboration with the Americans.

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:02.390
The men grab the children as the mother begs
them to let them go.

00:13:02.390 --> 00:13:06.250
Nevertheless, they still drown the boy and
hang the daughter, as the soldiers watch from

00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:10.340
behind the hiding spot, having already decided
that there are too many of them to engage

00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:11.340
with.

00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:15.830
Lastly, they soak the father in kerosene and
burn him, while the squad does nothing.

00:13:15.830 --> 00:13:19.839
After the enemy leaves, Tappert sees that
the little boys have also been killed.

00:13:19.839 --> 00:13:23.670
As soon as the squad is out of the house,
the mother comes out screaming with a bomb,

00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:26.630
and even though Butchie tackles her, they
all blow up.

00:13:26.630 --> 00:13:30.440
Chris comes back to reality and asks the doctor
why they did what they did.

00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:34.760
He explains that they had to create a sim
in which they were in WW2 but in no immediate

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:35.760
danger.

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:40.220
Butchie woke up one day for unknown reasons
and when he saw his body, he simply died.

00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:43.709
Chris thinks that everything that they saw
and heard in the castle was them sending subliminal

00:13:43.709 --> 00:13:45.560
messages to themselves.

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:50.209
He also tells the doctor that something is
wrong with the simulation and asks about "vetrilek".

00:13:50.209 --> 00:13:53.580
The nurse tells him that they all said the
word at one point or another when the soldier

00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:57.080
remembers the moments after the explosion
with the mother saying the word "vetrilek"

00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:58.080
to him.

00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:01.860
Suddenly, the lights begin to flicker in the
facility and the ghosts appear there as well

00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:05.339
while Chris is saying that they brought them
to life and gave them power.

00:14:05.339 --> 00:14:09.050
The soldiers begin to convulse and Chris begs
to be brought back to the sim to save his

00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:10.050
men.

00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:14.630
The nurse agrees and brings him back inside,
but tells him that his memory will be wiped.

00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:23.070
Chris wakes up in the woods and sees the apparition
on the adjacent tree and asks what it wants.
