00:00:06.659 --> 00:00:08.003
hey what's up guys

00:00:08.051 --> 00:00:11.795
today I'll show you a superhero action film: "The Old Guard" 

00:00:11.939 --> 00:00:15.107
spoiler ahead, watch out and take care

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.525
in the city of Morocco, a man riding a motorbike 

00:00:18.525 --> 00:00:21.550
stops in front of a woman in short hair named Andy

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.459
they look at each other and smile

00:00:23.603 --> 00:00:26.771
They are old friends, but they haven't seen each other for long

00:00:26.867 --> 00:00:30.995
the man is called Booker, and has worked for Andy for years in the past

00:00:31.139 --> 00:00:34.979
this time, he accepts a job from the former CIA agent James 

00:00:35.027 --> 00:00:37.043
and would like Andy to join him

00:00:37.187 --> 00:00:40.355
James starts a company specializing in hostage rescue

00:00:40.547 --> 00:00:44.291
this time, the mission is to rescue some girls in South Sudan

00:00:44.387 --> 00:00:47.123
James would like to hire Andy at a high price

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.763
though Andy doesn't make deals with strangers

00:00:49.811 --> 00:00:52.595
she agrees to meet James first at Booker's insistence

00:00:52.691 --> 00:00:56.400
before meeting James, she contacts a couple, Joe and Nicky

00:00:56.566 --> 00:00:58.534
who live a seclusion life in the downtown

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.510
they are very happy to see each other

00:01:01.654 --> 00:01:03.862
when Andy tells them her purpose for this trip

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:08.518
Joe and Nicky feel grad to accept the job because that's what they are good at

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.686
the next day, Andy meets James as promised

00:01:11.878 --> 00:01:14.374
James answers Andy's questions in detail

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.254
from the background information to the action plan

00:01:17.398 --> 00:01:19.270
she finally lets down her guard

00:01:19.366 --> 00:01:24.550
in fact, Andy has set Joy as a sniper, watching James' every movement

00:01:24.598 --> 00:01:28.198
if something goes wrong, Joy will shoot him immediately

00:01:28.342 --> 00:01:31.510
actually, the sly James knows about their plan

00:01:31.798 --> 00:01:35.254
after winning Andy's trust, he even waves at the sniper  

00:01:35.542 --> 00:01:40.390
after some preparation, Andy and her team fly to South Susan in a helicopter

00:01:40.486 --> 00:01:44.086
bringing all sorts of weapons, including the high-tech ones

00:01:44.278 --> 00:01:49.078
when the night falls, Andy and other three teammates sneak into the village as planned

00:01:49.318 --> 00:01:51.574
after taking down the security guards quietly

00:01:51.814 --> 00:01:55.366
they find a house and notice many old shoes placing at the door

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:58.486
it seems to be the place where they hold the hostages

00:01:58.774 --> 00:02:01.270
so they blow up the door and run inside

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.630
however, they find no hostages inside at all

00:02:04.726 --> 00:02:08.470
Andy soon realizes it is a damned trap, but it is too late

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:11.878
several masked men in full gear suddenly shoot at them

00:02:11.974 --> 00:02:15.478
Andy and her teammates are all terminated by heavy gunshots

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.030
as the masked men think the game is over and are about to leave

00:02:19.318 --> 00:02:22.054
they are astonished to see Andy begin to heal

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.126
and surprisingly, bullets are pushed out of their bodies

00:02:25.558 --> 00:02:28.294
the four dead slowly get up and fight back 

00:02:28.342 --> 00:02:30.886
before the masked men can figure out what's happening

00:02:31.222 --> 00:02:32.950
soon all the masked men are killed

00:02:33.094 --> 00:02:36.550
after that however, Andy finds a camera in a corner

00:02:36.694 --> 00:02:39.094
now she realizes they are set up by James

00:02:39.142 --> 00:02:41.830
who is right now watching them in front of the monitor

00:02:41.926 --> 00:02:43.942
he can't believe what he has seen

00:02:44.038 --> 00:02:47.302
however, their regeneration has been recorded remotely

00:02:47.446 --> 00:02:51.574
in anger, Andy breaks the camera before leaving with her teammates

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.982
Andy decides to find James and find out what he really wants

00:02:55.126 --> 00:02:57.958
otherwise, they will be brought into big trouble

00:02:58.246 --> 00:03:03.910
in Afganistan, while the US troops are searching for terrorists hiding in civilian's houses

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.038
a female soldier has her throat cut by a terrorist during the mission

00:03:08.182 --> 00:03:11.062
the cut is so deep that people think she is going to die

00:03:11.206 --> 00:03:15.910
strangely, when she is carried back to be base, she recovers miraculously

00:03:16.006 --> 00:03:19.942
her experience is shared with Andy and the other three in the dream

00:03:20.278 --> 00:03:24.406
Andy knows this soldier is one of them who have regenerative healing power

00:03:24.454 --> 00:03:26.470
and she is going to meet troubles

00:03:26.518 --> 00:03:31.750
in order to help this confused soldier, Andy decides to go and find the soldier on her own

00:03:31.798 --> 00:03:35.158
while the other three stick to the original plan of hunting James

00:03:35.398 --> 00:03:39.286
later, the female soldier's comrades are astonished to see her recovery

00:03:39.478 --> 00:03:40.774
but they don't cheer for her

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.030
instead, they think she is a freak

00:03:43.174 --> 00:03:46.918
after all, a normal person would have died in that situation

00:03:46.918 --> 00:03:49.700
the female soldier doesn't know what she has done wrong 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.198
and why she is excluded from the group

00:03:52.582 --> 00:03:56.854
meanwhile, in London, a pharmaceutical expert is delivering a passionate speech

00:03:57.046 --> 00:04:01.318
his company is researching how to prolong human life and has made a breakthrough

00:04:01.366 --> 00:04:04.246
but he needs more funding for future research

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:07.606
James sends the video of their regeneration to the expert

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.062
the expert feels excited to see those people with amazing power 

00:04:11.158 --> 00:04:14.230
which are the perfect specimens for his research project

00:04:14.326 --> 00:04:18.070
so he orders James to bring these four people back to him at any cost

00:04:18.214 --> 00:04:22.486
in the military base, the female soldier's situation isn't getting better

00:04:22.774 --> 00:04:25.126
she is ordered to go to Germany for more tests

00:04:25.366 --> 00:04:28.294
just before the plane takes off, Andy appears

00:04:28.534 --> 00:04:32.710
Andy strikes down a couple of soldiers and takes the female soldier away 

00:04:32.806 --> 00:04:34.582
after she knocks her out

00:04:34.726 --> 00:04:38.134
when the female soldier wakes up, she tries to escape

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:40.294
but she is shot in the head by Andy

00:04:40.534 --> 00:04:44.230
after a while, the female soldier's wound heals itself

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:47.542
Andy tells the female soldier that they are all immortal

00:04:47.686 --> 00:04:49.750
they will heal but won't be killed

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:54.790
however, the female soldier is so confused and doesn't believe her smelly shit

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:57.718
Andy asks the female soldier to come with her

00:04:57.814 --> 00:05:00.262
it won't be long before she knows the truth

00:05:00.454 --> 00:05:02.758
the female soldier has no better choice 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:05.926
but to get on a personal aircraft to London with Andy

00:05:06.022 --> 00:05:09.958
however, the female soldier still can't believe that she is immortal

00:05:10.054 --> 00:05:12.358
on the plane, she attacks suddenly

00:05:12.406 --> 00:05:15.910
Andy retaliates and breaks the female soldier's arm and leg

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:19.606
after a few minutes,  the female soldier's wounds heal again

00:05:19.846 --> 00:05:23.014
she begins to believe that she has some kind of mysterious power

00:05:23.158 --> 00:05:27.334
moments later, Andy leads the female soldier to a remote mansion 

00:05:27.382 --> 00:05:29.254
where her teammates are waiting for them

00:05:29.494 --> 00:05:34.400
they explain to the female soldier all about the immortals, their role in helping people

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.000
and their healing power as well

00:05:36.262 --> 00:05:39.958
and also, the immortal community can even share dreams with each other

00:05:40.054 --> 00:05:43.462
which is what made them notice her existence and find her

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:48.598
for centuries they have been playing the role of guards and helping to rescue innocent people

00:05:48.742 --> 00:05:52.198
Andy tells the female soldier that immortals can actually die

00:05:52.294 --> 00:05:56.518
one day if their wounds stop healing without any warning, they will die

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:01.270
until this point, all the weird happenings finally make sense to the female soldier

00:06:01.606 --> 00:06:04.678
she has been haunted by the same nightmares for a long time

00:06:04.774 --> 00:06:08.950
in the dream, a woman is locked in an iron maiden and cast into the sea

00:06:09.046 --> 00:06:12.742
the woman in the dream is drowning and screaming in despair

00:06:12.982 --> 00:06:16.342
there is a mournful silence as the group hear her dream

00:06:16.438 --> 00:06:20.038
later, they tell her that the woman in her dream is called Quynh

00:06:20.134 --> 00:06:23.254
the first immortal that Andy found hundreds of years ago

00:06:23.398 --> 00:06:27.862
in joint efforts, they fought against the evil powers through many historic battles

00:06:28.198 --> 00:06:32.374
but because of their immortality, there were accused of the dark witches by the church

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:34.678
and punished with repeated tortures 

00:06:34.822 --> 00:06:38.614
however, they would not die no matter what the church did to them

00:06:38.758 --> 00:06:43.558
therefore, the church locked Quynh in an iron maiden and cast her into the sea

00:06:43.654 --> 00:06:46.850
even though the immortals won't die, they can feel the pain

00:06:47.082 --> 00:06:52.074
so Quynh keeps drowning and coming back to life, suffering the endless torment

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:55.914
Andy can't forgive herself for what happened to Quynh 

00:06:56.298 --> 00:06:58.986
later, the group are ambushed by armed soldiers

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:04.986
after fierce gunfire, Booker is seriously injured, while Joy and Nicky are captured up

00:07:05.226 --> 00:07:07.962
Andy knows these men must be sent by James 

00:07:08.106 --> 00:07:12.762
enraged by the attack, she terminates all the enemies who haven't yet left 

00:07:12.906 --> 00:07:15.834
and then leaves the mansion with the female soldier and Booker

00:07:15.978 --> 00:07:20.154
they rest in an abandoned mine and try to figure out how to find James

00:07:20.298 --> 00:07:23.370
just then, Andy realizes that her wound is not healing

00:07:23.466 --> 00:07:25.770
which means she is not immortal anymore

00:07:25.962 --> 00:07:28.458
but Andy doesn't tell anyone about that

00:07:28.554 --> 00:07:32.106
she knows the current mission is to rescue the captured Joy and Nicky

00:07:32.202 --> 00:07:34.314
she can't let others worry about her

00:07:34.458 --> 00:07:37.338
meanwhile, Joy and Nicky are taken to the expert

00:07:37.386 --> 00:07:40.362
after their regenerative healing abilities are confirmed

00:07:40.506 --> 00:07:43.194
they are taken to a lab for experiments

00:07:43.386 --> 00:07:46.746
James thought the expert just wanted to take some samples from the immortals

00:07:46.842 --> 00:07:50.634
and never expected the expert would conduct cruel experiments on them

00:07:50.778 --> 00:07:53.946
they will never let Joy and Niky leave the lab alive

00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:59.034
right then, James feels sorry for them, but he doesn't dare to express his defiance

00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:02.202
later, Booker finds out where James lives

00:08:02.442 --> 00:08:05.130
Andy takes the female soldier there straight away

00:08:05.178 --> 00:08:10.026
however, the female soldier doesn't want to kill anymore and withdraws from the mission

00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:11.850
Andy doesn't force her

00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:16.410
instead, she gives her a gun for self-defense and lets her leave in the car

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:19.275
soon after, Andy and Booker find James

00:08:19.482 --> 00:08:22.842
just when Andy is trying to find out why James is hunting them

00:08:22.938 --> 00:08:25.242
Booker suddenly shoots Andy in the back

00:08:25.338 --> 00:08:28.746
it's revealed that Booker has betrayed Andy and the immortals

00:08:28.794 --> 00:08:32.922
and he believes that as long as the expert can unlock the secret of their immortality

00:08:33.066 --> 00:08:36.474
there will be a way to end it, so that he can live a normal life

00:08:36.618 --> 00:08:40.026
James is helping the expert to set Andy up and capture the group 

00:08:40.074 --> 00:08:44.730
because he wants to find a way to cure all diseases after his wife died of cancer

00:08:44.922 --> 00:08:48.186
when Booker surprisingly sees that Andy's wound doesn't heal

00:08:48.282 --> 00:08:51.018
he regrets it a lot and tries to save her

00:08:51.114 --> 00:08:53.130
however, everything is too late

00:08:53.274 --> 00:08:55.866
the expert finds them and takes them away

00:08:55.914 --> 00:08:59.274
James is knocked out when he tries to stop the expert

00:08:59.658 --> 00:09:03.786
luckily, the female soldier changes her mind and returns to help Andy

00:09:03.882 --> 00:09:05.706
but only to find James there

00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:08.538
she is so guilty that she couldn't come earlier

00:09:08.682 --> 00:09:12.186
in James' office, the female soldier learns that for centuries 

00:09:12.282 --> 00:09:17.178
Andy and her group have been rescuing people and maintaining peace in the human world

00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:20.874
the female soldier begins to admire Andy for her sacrifices

00:09:21.066 --> 00:09:23.226
she decides to go and save Andy

00:09:23.466 --> 00:09:25.674
having figured out the expert's evil purpose

00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:30.618
James decides to help the female soldier, so he takes her to the expert's lab

00:09:30.749 --> 00:09:33.821
later, the female soldier gets shot by the security guards

00:09:33.917 --> 00:09:38.477
but she pretends to be dead and takes a good chance to clear all of them in an instant

00:09:38.573 --> 00:09:42.317
shortly after, she finds Andy and the other teammates in a lab

00:09:42.461 --> 00:09:48.029
after being set free, they take up weapons quickly and rush to the swarming enemies outside

00:09:48.461 --> 00:09:53.117
with sharp skills and the power of healing, they beat the gunmen just like a piece of shit 

00:09:53.213 --> 00:09:56.141
and manage to break through the heavy siege finally

00:09:56.381 --> 00:10:00.893
in the end, they find and confront the expert, who resists giving up

00:10:01.037 --> 00:10:04.157
while the expert is pointing a gun at Andy during the confrontation

00:10:04.253 --> 00:10:07.037
the female soldier, knowing that Andy is vulnerable

00:10:07.085 --> 00:10:11.400
runs between them and grabs the expert, then throws both of them out of the window

00:10:11.597 --> 00:10:14.477
falling all the way to a car parking on the street

00:10:14.573 --> 00:10:19.709
as a result, the expert is killed instantly while the female soldier is seriously injured

00:10:19.805 --> 00:10:23.453
but soon, she recovers and helped to her feet by her group 

00:10:23.549 --> 00:10:25.709
finally, the group unite again 

00:10:25.853 --> 00:10:29.885
and continue their mission to rescue innocent people under Andy's leadership

00:10:30.475 --> 00:10:33.485
this's Daniel CC movie channel, peace out
