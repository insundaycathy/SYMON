00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:06.494
Hi, Mystery Recapped here. Today I’m going&nbsp;
to explain an American monster movie called&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.494 --> 00:00:11.510
“The Sand.” Spoilers ahead!&nbsp;
Watch out and take care! 
&nbsp;

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:21.840
The movie starts with some youngsters partying on&nbsp;
a beach. A cameraman films everyone as they dance,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.440
make out and have fun. A guy named Mitch makes&nbsp;
everyone put their phones in a bag, so no one can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:33.040
take pictures of the wild night and put them on&nbsp;
the internet. Then, two guys, Vance and Gilbert,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:38.400
bring a ball of gooey substance, claiming that&nbsp;
they found it in the water. Everyone is disgusted,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.200
but they do not think much of it. The scene&nbsp;
abruptly cuts to the following morning. Everyone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:49.440
has fallen asleep. A girl named Kaylee is with&nbsp;
Mitch while four of their friends, namely, Chanda,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.680
Jonah, Ronnie, and Vance, are in a car nearby.&nbsp;
Kaylee wakes up first and is looking around when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.520
she sees a bird on the beach, struggling to fly.&nbsp;
She assumes that it is stuck but, all of a sudden,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:07.120
the bird sinks into the sand. A shocked Kaylee&nbsp;
tries to warn everyone not to step on the sand.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:12.400
But when she turns around, she sees her other&nbsp;
friend Marsha, who was lying naked on a bench,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:17.920
jump on the sand. Her feet get stuck, and&nbsp;
she cannot move. The group is confused,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:23.120
and Vance tries running out to get her. Kaylee&nbsp;
tries to stop him, but he doesn’t listen. He, too,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:29.280
falls on the sand before he can reach Marsha and&nbsp;
gets stuck. By now, Marsha is nowhere to be seen;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.560
the sand has swallowed her completely.
Vance screams in pain and asks his girlfriend&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.720
Ronnie to help him. As Vance tries to lift&nbsp;
his head, his skin and eye being pulled out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:46.240
of his head. A horrified Ronnie screams his&nbsp;
name when he sinks into the sand. The group&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.040
starts brainstorming ideas on how this can happen.&nbsp;
When they try to call someone, they realize their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:56.640
phones are in the trunk of the car. Jonah tries to&nbsp;
start the car, but its battery is dead. The group&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.480
is completely stuck on the beach. Kaylee then goes&nbsp;
near the deck and hovers her hand over the sand.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:08.640
We see white strings trying to reach her palm from&nbsp;
under the sand. Mitch is surprised to see it too.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.360
Just then, another one of their friends named&nbsp;
Gilbert wakes up stuck inside a trash can. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.240
curses the guys for jamming him into the bin after&nbsp;
he passed out the other night. The group warns&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:24.400
him not to move. Gilbert is confused but obliges&nbsp;
when he hears that Marsha and Vance are dead. 
&nbsp;

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.480
Mitch and Kaylee go inside, and Jonah looks&nbsp;
at them in jealousy. Kaylee and Jonah were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:34.000
in a relationship a short while ago, but she is&nbsp;
hurt as Johan is with Chanda now. Chanda tries to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.200
console Jonah, saying that Kaylee finally found&nbsp;
someone for her. A few hours pass, but no one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.720
comes looking for them. Kaylee finds a sunscreen&nbsp;
and passes it to those outside. Gilbert is on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.360
verge of passing out because of the heat. 
Kaylee then starts brainstorming how this could&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.360
have happened. They look around and finally&nbsp;
realize that everyone else who was at the party&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.640
has been sucked into the sand too. Just then,&nbsp;
Kaylee notices the gooey ball from the other night&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.040
near the water and sees that it has hatched.&nbsp;
They figure that it was an egg of some kind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.920
of creature that lives under the sand. It has&nbsp;
been eating people as its food. Since it was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:13.200
just born yesterday, the creature must be small&nbsp;
in size and have a shape. Kaylee devises a plan&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:18.240
to figure out how large the creature is. She gets&nbsp;
sausages and starts throwing them around the beach&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:23.440
to see how big the creature is. Gilbert sees a&nbsp;
bird being sucked into the sand and freaks out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.960
He finally realizes everything&nbsp;
his friends are saying is true.
&nbsp;

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:31.200
The others retaliate against throwing sausages&nbsp;
around, claiming that it is their only source of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.640
food, but Kaylee doesn’t stop. The last sausage&nbsp;
doesn’t get sucked in, and the group celebrates,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.840
seeing there might be a way out. But they still&nbsp;
have no way to reach that far in the sand.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.560
Jonah then gets in the back of their car and picks&nbsp;
up two surfboards. He keeps one on the sand and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.120
jumps on top of it. Everyone is delighted when&nbsp;
he doesn’t sink. Jonah then makes his way to a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:57.440
bench nearby. Just when he is about to step on it,&nbsp;
the surfboard moves by itself. Jonah almost falls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.640
to the ground, and the string from inside the sand&nbsp;
gets into his stomach. He manages to save himself,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.720
but his stomach is hurt. He finds a bag&nbsp;
full of food supplies on the bench. 
&nbsp;

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:12.000
He accidentally drops a banana on the ground, but&nbsp;
it doesn’t sink. Jonah hovers his hands over the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.640
ground and figures out that the banana fell on&nbsp;
the part where they lit the bonfire last night.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:22.240
So the creature cannot come out through fire&nbsp;
or ash. When he stands, we see the wounds in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:27.600
his stomach get worse and pus starting to come&nbsp;
out of it. He starts to freak out, and Kaylee&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:32.160
calms him down, telling him to go through the&nbsp;
bag. He passes sodas and water that he found&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:37.040
in the bag to everyone while still whimpering&nbsp;
in pain. His wounds get worse by the second.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:42.080
Jonah then tries passing a can to Mitch, but the&nbsp;
pouches of pus on his stomach start to break. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.800
cries in pain and lies down on the bench. 
The surfboards on the ground are still moving,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.760
suggesting that the creature is growing and&nbsp;
developing. Kaylee notices the strings attaching&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:56.640
to the car’s tires, trying to move it. They do&nbsp;
not have much time before the creature develops&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:02.000
big enough to swallow the whole car. Chanda and&nbsp;
Ronnie try getting the phones from the trunk.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.200
Ronnie offers to get on top of the hood and try&nbsp;
to open it. She asks Chanda to give the letter she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:12.640
has written in a diary to her mother in case she&nbsp;
dies, and steps on the hood. She is about to open&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:17.760
it, but Kaylee stops her, saying that the trunk&nbsp;
will open wide and make her fall into the sand.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:22.800
Kaylee gives them a rescue hook so Ronnie can hold&nbsp;
onto it. She finally manages to open the trunk.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:28.160
Just then, a car drives to the beach and honks at&nbsp;
the group. This startles Ronnie; she accidentally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:33.520
closes the trunk again. Her fingers get stuck&nbsp;
on it, making her cry in pain. Mitch and Kaylee&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:38.400
yell at the car to help them. Inside the car is&nbsp;
a beach patrol officer. He assumes that the group&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:43.120
is on drugs and doesn’t take them seriously.&nbsp;
Despite Kaylee yelling at him to stay inside&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:48.800
his car, the man steps out of it. The group is&nbsp;
surprised when he walks freely on the beach. 
&nbsp;

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:54.160
A close-up of his feet shows us that the strings&nbsp;
cannot attach to his shoes. The officer goes near&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:58.880
Jonah and is disgusted by his wounds. He&nbsp;
completely ignores his pleas to help him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:04.080
still assuming that the group is on drugs. He&nbsp;
goes to talk to Kaylee and insults her and Mitch&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:09.360
for being reckless teenagers. He asks Kaylee&nbsp;
to step out and gets angry when she disagrees.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.720
He threatens to use his pepper spray&nbsp;
on them, but when he reaches to get it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:18.160
he accidentally drops his keys on the sand. The&nbsp;
man then gets stuck while trying to pick them up.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:22.880
The officer finally understands that the group&nbsp;
wasn’t lying, but cannot do anything now.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:27.760
Kayle advises him to use the pepper spray on the&nbsp;
strings that are catching him. The spray works,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:33.120
and he manages to free his hand, but half of his&nbsp;
arm is gone. He screams in pain, and the strings&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:38.240
pull him down again. After he is completely sucked&nbsp;
into the sand, Kaylee gets the pepper spray he had&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:43.520
dropped. Now, Mitch plans to use sandals and&nbsp;
towels wrapped on his feet to run through the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:48.000
sand and get to the officer’s car. He believes&nbsp;
since the officer’s shoes resisted the creature,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.160
the sandals would too. Chanda throws the&nbsp;
towel at Mitch, but the railing breaks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:57.280
when he tries to catch it. Mitch falls onto the&nbsp;
sand and is brutally eaten by the creature. 
&nbsp;

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:00.880
Kaylee has had enough of the creature.&nbsp;
She sees the fallen railing moving on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:05.840
the ground and gets an idea. She breaks a part&nbsp;
of the railing again and hands it to Chanda,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:10.960
planning to use it as a bridge later. She then&nbsp;
gets on the deck and manages to jump on the car.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:15.760
As soon as she lands, Kaylee punches Chanda&nbsp;
in the face for sleeping with her boyfriend.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:19.600
Chanda doesn’t mind, and the two help Ronnie&nbsp;
to get her fingers out of the trunk. 
&nbsp;

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:24.560
Jonah, who has been on the bench the whole time,&nbsp;
tells Kaylee that he loves her. Kaylee then tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:29.520
them of her plan. She wants to use the railing as&nbsp;
a bridge to get to Jonah and then bring everyone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:34.880
to the officer’s car. Chanda gets the railing&nbsp;
and places it on the sand. She walks carefully&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:39.920
and manages to reach Jonah. Kaylee does the&nbsp;
same. The three are safely at the bench when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:45.760
Ronnie walks towards them. However, the strings&nbsp;
latch onto her injured hand, making her fall.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:49.760
Kaylee tries saving her with the help of&nbsp;
pepper spray, but it only works for a second.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:54.960
The creature grabs Ronnie into the sand. Chanda&nbsp;
then wraps her feet with a towel and a bag&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:59.680
and runs to the car. She successfully gets&nbsp;
on its hood before the strings can catch her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:05.280
Gilbert cheers to celebrate, but not long after,&nbsp;
his bin starts shaking. His body is cut by the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:09.760
edge of the trash can and the blood attracts&nbsp;
the creature. The girls ask him to hold on,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:15.360
but the creature has gotten inside the bin and is&nbsp;
grabbing onto his legs. Gilbert starts vomiting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:20.400
blood. Soon, several large pairs of limbs&nbsp;
grab him and drag him into the ground. 
&nbsp;

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:25.120
The limbs then shake the car and make Chanda&nbsp;
fall on the hood. She falls unconscious as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:30.640
Kaylee yells at her to wake up. Several hours&nbsp;
pass, and now it is nighttime. Chanda finally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:35.600
regains consciousness. Kaylee is still at the&nbsp;
bench with an injured Jonah. Chanda discovers a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:40.720
raft on the top of the officer’s car and uses it&nbsp;
to get to the bench. The three successfully get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:46.160
to the raft and to the vehicle. Chanda and Jonah&nbsp;
are inside the car, but before Kaylee can come in,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:51.840
a massive glowing tentacle attacks her. The&nbsp;
creature has grown to its full potential now.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:57.360
Kaylee gets on top of the car, where she finds a&nbsp;
gas can. She uses it to light the tentacle on fire&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:02.880
and gets inside the car. Everything goes silent&nbsp;
as Kaylee and Chanda realize that Jonah has died&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:07.920
from his injuries. The girls hug each other and&nbsp;
cry, mourning the loss of their friends. 
&nbsp;

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:12.320
It is now the following morning, a man knocks&nbsp;
on the car’s windows, waking the girls.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:17.680
They see that the monster is gone now, and they&nbsp;
can walk on the sand. The two walk across the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:23.280
sand together, traumatized, as the man calls for&nbsp;
an ambulance. In a closing shot, the creature,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:28.160
revealed as an enormous jellyfish, is seen in&nbsp;
the water, headed towards Santa Monica Pier.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:33.200
That was probably the most exhilarating game of&nbsp;
‘The Floor is Lava’ that they ever played.
