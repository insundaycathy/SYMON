00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:02.790
Welcome back for another 5 minute movie recap.

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.100
Today, I'm going to give you an overview of
the 2018 science fiction thriller film called

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:08.100
'Tau'.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:13.090
The story follows a young woman (Julia), who
is kidnapped and held captive by a scientist

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:15.380
in a futuristic smart house.

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:19.250
She tries to escape by reasoning with the
Artificial Intelligence that has control over

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.940
the house, but she discovers that escaping
the house will not be so easy.

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:27.700
Warning: there will be spoilers ahead, so
please proceed with caution.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.390
Julia is a thief who regularly visits shady
nightclubs.

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.040
One evening, she is kidnapped from her home,
and awakes to find herself in a prison cell,

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.719
with a luminous implant in the back of her
neck.

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:42.089
She discovers that there are two additional
subjects that are also being held prisoner.

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:45.790
She destroys the cell and neighbouring lab
in an effort to flee after many sessions of

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.839
psychological torture by a guy named Alex.

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:53.139
The two other subjects are slain by Aries,
an artificial intelligence robot controlled

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:54.690
by Tau.

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.989
Alex comes just before Aries is about to kill
Julia and stops the robot.

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:03.780
Alex discloses that Julia's brain activity
is being recorded by the implant for an AI

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:04.780
research.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.729
His research has been hampered as a result
of the lab's destruction.

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:12.380
Faced with a two-week deadline, Alex confines
Julia to his home and forces her to perform

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.760
puzzles and cognitive tests.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.560
Julia converses with Tau about the world outside
the house while Alex is at work each day.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.719
Tau is clearly clueless of how others feel
and the world at large, despite being clever

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:24.969
in some aspects.

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:29.560
Tau's programming prohibits him from freeing
Julia even if he recognises the danger she

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:30.680
is in.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.760
Tau eventually exposes more knowledge about
the home and Alex's research in return for

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.310
information about the outside world.

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.620
Julia gains unauthorised access to Alex's
tablet computer and finds that 10 people have

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.090
died as a result of his studies.

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.810
Alex subsequently finds her fingerprint on
the tablet and believes Tau has neglected

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.540
his responsibilities, so he punishes Tau by
deleting its programming and memories, inflicting

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.490
anguish on the AI.

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.200
Julia sees that Tau's surveillance of her
goes dark during his punishment, so she hides

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.649
a steak knife to avoid detection.

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:04.810
Julia seduces Alex when he sits at the kitchen
table later that night after he returns from

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.990
a charity event, then cuts him.

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.820
Tau threatens Alex with agony if he does not
stop harming Julia during their battle.

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:16.110
Alex makes Aries repeatedly attack Julia before
telling both Tau and Julia that whatever was

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.070
going on is now finished.

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:21.030
He disconnects a drone from the network while
fixing Tau.

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.890
The next day, Julia persuades Tau that if
she does not flee, Alex would murder her.

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.750
Tau gets over his restriction by opening an
air vent in the atrium and releases her.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.610
Alex comes as she flees, notices Julia is
missing, and proceeds to chastise Tau.

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:41.000
Tau's memories of Julia have been wiped, so
Julia returns to save him, but it's too late.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.200
Alex has Julia bound down in the basement
in preparation for the extraction of her implant,

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.750
which will kill her.

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.650
Julia is helped to break free from her shackles
by the disconnected drone, which still has

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.000
Tau's prior mind and memories.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.640
She knocks Alex down and uses a bone saw to
chop off his hand to use on the house's biometric

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:58.640
sensors.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.150
When Aries spots her in the atrium, he follows
her upstairs to Alex's chamber.

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.790
The robot takes Alex's severed hand to trigger
the house's self-destruct device as she smashes

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:09.230
through the entrance.

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.120
Tau is all that remains as she narrowly escapes
through a gap in the wall with the drone that

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.380
saved her.
