00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:10.420
Welcome to Cinema Summary ladies and gentlemen,
and let me tell you: Siblings are a pain in

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:14.090
the butt but they are family and
sometimes they will be all that's

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:15.789
left for you in this world.

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:21.280
Now just so you know, this video will be split
into 2 sections: a summary and an explanation

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.940
section that will focus on things like autism
 about the legality of counting cards,

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.160
as well as the man who the titular
Rain Man is based upon

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.039
If you’ve already seen the movie 
and you're interested in those facts

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.280
you can skip to this time code onscreen now

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.400
but if you haven't already or just want a quick recap:

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.600
This is Rain Man

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.610
In the City of Angels, one Charlie Babbitt
is busy at work: he’s a douche-y looking

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.930
yuppie who has a business selling
luxury cars to clients.

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.670
But things have turned for the worse as the
most recent Lamborghini’s he’s planning

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:00.870
on selling have been held up as they failed
to meet the EPA’s emission regulations which

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.680
sucks as he really needs to sell these cars
to their buyers so that he can pay back the

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.950
loan he took out to buy the cars.

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.350
So, he tries to keep his buyers interested
and get an extension on his loan.

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.120
He works with Lenny and Susanna, his girlfriend
who he takes to go to Palm Springs though

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.420
on their way there he gets a call from his
dad’s lawyer, who tells him

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.539
his father, Sanford Babbitt, has passed away.

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:29.870
He heads to Cincinnati with Susanna to attend
the funeral and we learn that at a young age,

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:34.409
Charlie’s mother died leaving him alone
with his very distant dad, they had a falling

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.810
out and since then Charlie has cut himself
off from his dad.

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.090
But he’s willing to go to the funeral and
head back to his old stomping ground.

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.409
The house is empty and lifeless but in the
garage is a beautiful old car full of memories,

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:50.619
it’s a 1949 Buick Roadster Convertible.

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:55.880
An absolute gorgeous piece of machinery that
had been a source of contention between Charlie

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.340
and his dad who never let him drive the car
and the one time that Charlie snuck out and

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.810
took it for a joy ride with a few of his buddies:
it led to him getting booked at the police

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.710
station where his dad left him there for 2 days.

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:08.710
Yeesh.

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:13.190
Thankfully since his dad’s dead, Charlie
is going to get his inheritance which amounts

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.550
to a couple of fancy rose bushes and the Buick
Convertible with the $3 million-dollar

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.220
estate going to an unnamed trustee.

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.551
But with a little bit of digging, Charlie is able
to figure out that the trustee is

00:02:25.551 --> 00:02:30.890
at the Wallbrook Institute, a mental hospital
that caters towards people with special needs.

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.720
While he’s there, he encounters
a peculiar man who recognizes the car Charlie

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.530
drives as the strange man’s dad let him
drive the Buick when he was younger.

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:41.770
Who’s your dad?

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:42.790
Sanford Babbit.

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:43.840
And your mother?

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.110
Eleanore Babbit.

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.980
Charlie finds out from Dr. Bruner, that the
strange man in question is: Raymond Babbit,

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.810
his biological, blood brother who is a high
functioning autistic.

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.300
A condition that makes him quirky, being very
focused on following routines, keeping things

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.970
exactly where they are, and quoting Abbot
and Costello under his breath to calm himself

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:02.970
down.

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.060
So, as a loving brother trying to “get to
know” his newfound brother, Charlie takes

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.150
Raymond out of Wallbrook and together with
Susanna head to LA.

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.340
On their way there, they stop and stay at
a motel for the night which gets awkward as

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.890
they try to deal with Raymond’s eccentricities
which leads to an argument breaking out between

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.260
Susanna and Charlie about Charlie exploiting
his brother for his $3 million dollars and

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.200
Susanna leaves Charlie.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.820
The next day, the brothers have breakfast
at a diner where Charlie gets on the phone

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:32.150
with Dr. Bruner who insists on Raymond’s
return to Wallbrook.

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.840
While Raymond is trying to get some toothpicks
from a waitress, she drops the box of toothpicks

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.400
spilling them on the floor and Raymond is
able to count every single spilled toothpick

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.210
in the blink of an eye.

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:44.890
Something that Charlie takes note of but doesn’t
think about.

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.460
As they continue on their journey, things
are getting worse for Charlie: whose loans

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:53.130
are pass due and the cars he’s trying to
sell are still locked up.

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:58.930
So, he tries to catch a flight to LA but Raymond
refuses to get on any of the planes and freaks

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.710
out when Charlie tries to drag him to the
terminal so they drive there and while on

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:09.290
the interstate highway system, a motor accident
occurs and Raymond becomes deeply concerned

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.280
with the danger of the road.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:16.459
So, they have to get off the highway and continue
their journey, taking up even more time on

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:19.940
what was supposed to be a 3-day drive to LA.

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.590
However, after staying at a motel, they’re
held up by the rain which Raymond doesn’t

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:29.860
like so Charlie begins making calls to try
to get an extension on the loan for his company.

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:35.560
However, while making some calls, he discovers
that Dr. Bruner never ‘established a conservatorship

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:40.150
of Raymond’, therefore there’s a high
chance that Charlie can get custody of Raymond

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.230
and of course the $3 million.

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:47.540
They continue driving until they hit a town
where Charlie takes Raymond to see a psychiatrist

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:52.940
who although can’t help Charlie too much does
test Raymond on his ability to calculate numbers

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:57.160
"Do you know how much the square root of 2130 is?"

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.960
"46.15192304"

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.700
demonstrates an immense talent for number crunching

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:08.040
From there, they have frequent stops, phone
calls concerning the state of the loans and

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.370
Charlie’s business, and stopping at motels
for the night.

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:15.850
Though at one motel, Charlie learns more about
his brother and finds out that Raymond was

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:22.320
or is Rain Man, his imaginary friend from
childhood who was taken to Wallbrook after

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:26.610
accidentally spilling hot water on Charlie
when he was a baby.

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:29.640
Their father having thought
Raymond intentionally hurt Charlie,

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:33.140
and kept Raymond at Wallbrook for his own sake.

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:37.370
The following day, things get worse as Charlie
finds out that the cars he was trying to sell

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:42.100
were repossessed to pay off the late loans
and the buyers for the cars want their money

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:46.780
back now which totals to about $80,000 dollars.

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:48.720
Money that Charlie doesn’t have.

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.010
He’s screwed.

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:55.500
They continue driving, passing through the Vegas Strip,
and while at a diner Charlie has a eureka moment

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:00.180
and discovers that Raymond’s impeccable 
memory makes him perfect for counting cards

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:04.160
So, they rush back to Vegas (after pawning
off Charlie’s watch for some cash), sprucing

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:08.230
Raymond up and buying some new duds, they
hit the Blackjack tables.

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:12.060
Time after time getting winning hands, again
and again.

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:15.980
Which gets the attention of the Casino security
who try to figure out how exactly they are

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:17.080
cheating.

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:22.020
After cashing out and many other things like
Raymond getting the attention of a foxy vixen

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:26.400
by the name of Iris, getting taught how to
dance by Charlie, as well as Susanna’s return

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:27.400
to Charlie.

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:32.330
Charlie is taken to meet with Mr. Kelso, the
head of casino security who tells him to take

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:36.570
his brother, leave Vegas with their winnings,
and never come back.

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:39.490
A generous offer that Charlie takes.

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:43.120
After leaving Vegas, and dropping Susanna
off at her apartment, the Babbitt Brothers

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:48.001
head to Charlie’s home in LA where Charlie
meets with Dr. Bruner and they have a talk

00:06:48.001 --> 00:06:53.370
about Charlie’s scheme to get the 3 million
from Raymond via a custody battle.

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:57.570
Not that it’ll matter as Bruner doesn’t
have to hand over any amount of the money

00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:03.430
from the trust to Charlie if he even can win
custody and offers a cheque of 250,000 dollars

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:07.540
to Charlie who rejects it because now it isn’t
about the money.

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:11.790
Now it’s about why the hell no one ever
told him that he had a brother.

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:13.540
Something that Bruner can’t answer.

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:19.020
The next morning, Raymond tries to make pancakes
but accidentally sets off the smoke alarm

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:26.960
the beeping from the alarm causes him to freak out and
he only calms down after Charlie breaks the alarm.

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:31.060
After breakfast, the Babbitts go to Raymond’s
custody hearing which ends with Charlie losing

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:36.699
custody of Raymond as due to his condition,
Raymond cannot make any decisions of his own

00:07:36.699 --> 00:07:41.169
and he cannot live safely or freely in the
world outside of Wallbrook.

00:07:41.169 --> 00:07:45.050
But even with this sour taste in Charlie’s
mouth, there’s a sweetness to this hearing:

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:49.850
he’s gotten to know his brother and learned
to love him even with his quirks and after

00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:53.990
the hearing, they go to the Amtrak and say
their goodbyes with Charlie giving Raymond

00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:58.760
a backpack full of all the things Raymond
likes including a copy of Abbot &amp; Costello’s

00:07:58.760 --> 00:07:59.919
Who’s On First.

00:07:59.919 --> 00:08:02.980
And as Raymond goes to his seat, Charlie looks on:

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:06.560
although he lost custody and his business is sunk

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:10.510
At least he got to know his brother and is
able to visit him when he wants to.

00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:11.680
Alright, so.

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:16.530
The talking points of this section will be
about with autism, it’s depiction in

00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:22.810
the film, as well as the legality of counting cards,
and the man who inspired Raymond Babbitt

00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:27.980
Now, autism is a real-world condition that is formally
known as “autism spectrum disorder” which

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:33.760
As depicted in the film, a few quirks of autistic
individuals are delayed response, avoidance

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:39.199
of eye contact, and impaired social skills
along with emotional outbursts, repetition

00:08:39.199 --> 00:08:46.509
of words or phrases, abusing themselves, and
an unusual tone of voice.

00:08:46.509 --> 00:08:51.240
All of which are demonstrated by Dustin Hoffman’s
impressive performance as Raymond Babbit,

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:57.740
Now individuals with autism are often described
as being low functioning or high functioning

00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:01.480
which based on my research is not a “clinical
term”, it’s more or less colloquial

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:05.640
Now it's mentioned in the film that Raymond
is a case of a high functioning autistic who

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:08.800
This is mentioned by the psychiatrist that Raymond and Charlie visit

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:15.620
that is to say that he's able to live in society, relatively undisturbed albeit needing some support

00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:19.020
of which Charlie is only able to provide some of

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:23.660
Which brings me to the topic concerning savants
of which Raymond is one of.

00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:27.640
Now savants are individuals with special needs or certain impairments

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:30.140
who demonstrate an immense talent in a particular

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:35.680
field, immense knowledge of a particular subject,
or even a creative skill that seems out of

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:38.380
place with their disability.

00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:44.380
Now, according to my research not every autist
can or will be a savant and even then, autists

00:09:44.389 --> 00:09:48.950
can have natural talents towards something
and they don’t have to be autistic in order

00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:50.339
to be a savant.

00:09:50.339 --> 00:09:55.389
Furthermore, autistic savants themselves don’t
have to be gifted in mental mathematics although

00:09:55.389 --> 00:09:59.220
usually they do demonstrate great memory like
Raymond.

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:03.060
A fascinating example of such a person is
Mary Temple Grandin,

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:07.620
or Temple Grandin" as she's usually
known a who is a very visual thinker

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:16.660
with photographic memory: able to memorize a lot
of information and freely manipulate it in her mind.

00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:21.929
Although the memorization of things whether
numbers, facts, entire books, or even cards

00:10:21.929 --> 00:10:24.220
can be more specific from person to person.

00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:29.500
Now something that Charlie
mentions is that card counting is illegal

00:10:29.509 --> 00:10:34.429
which based on my research is not true 
although casino authorities do frown upon it

00:10:34.429 --> 00:10:38.460
Now in case you didn’t know Card Counting is a strategy employed by gamblers for Blackjack,

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:42.160
to maximize wins and minimize losses

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:46.440
It revolves around a system of ‘valuing’
cards by how much of an advantage they give

00:10:46.459 --> 00:10:51.639
the player, betting high when the player has
an advantage and betting low when they don’t.

00:10:51.639 --> 00:10:54.949
Calculating the values of each player’s
hands on the fly while taking into account

00:10:54.949 --> 00:11:00.269
the number of decks remaining which for Raymond
is easy to remember, the value easy to calculate,

00:11:00.269 --> 00:11:03.920
and in turn predicting what cards will turn
up next is child’s play for him.

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:09.019
Now with that said, mentally counting cards
is NOT illegal since it doesn’t affect the

00:11:09.019 --> 00:11:11.959
outcome of the deal and it is a skill.

00:11:11.959 --> 00:11:17.579
An intellectual ability whereas using a machine
or electronic device to count the cards is

00:11:17.579 --> 00:11:21.829
very much illegal which does make it a little
strange that Charlie and Raymond were

00:11:21.829 --> 00:11:28.020
kicked out of the casino if they didn’t utilize such means to win but they were unfair to the casino and

00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:32.200
one way or another, casino's don't like that one bit
and as the old saying goes

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:34.900
The House always wins.

00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:39.920
So, unless your Raymond yourself, I would 
suggest you stay away from casinos

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:44.280
Which finally brings me to the man who
inspired Raymond Babbitt: Kim Peek

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:51.400
Kim Peek, who was not an autist but was a savant due to an abnormality in his brain

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:54.600
that led to his two hemispheres being disconnected

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:59.960
but that didn't stop him from being a walking, talking encyclopedia. You see, because of this abnormality

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:06.400
in his brain, he had impeccable memory, was able to read incredibly quickly due to his ability to read

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:12.520
2 pages with both eyes, and also had an immense talent for being able to calculate what days of the wee

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:18.000
a random date would be. Now how he ended up being the inspiration for Raymond is interesting

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:24.800
Barry Morrow, the screenwriter for Rain man, met Peek in 1984, in Arlington, Texas at a meeting for the

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:33.780
Association of Retarded Citizens, as Peek's dad was a chairman in a committee and before Morrow had written

00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:39.880
for a few TV movies about a 'retarded man named Bill'. Now supposedly they had a chat and Peek showed off

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:45.420
his amazing memory to Morrow and screenwriter was inspired to write a character based on Peek

00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:51.700
and that's how Raymond was born and the critical success of Rain Man led to Peek gaining celebrity status

00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:58.980
and began touring around the country where he would advocate for the increased tolerance of the disabled

00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:04.720
It’s strange to think that when he was a child, doctors said he wouldn’t be able to read walk, or talk

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:11.738
but by the time he died at the age of 58, he would’ve walked more than a thousand steps, would’ve talked

00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:17.860
more than a thousand words, and would’ve memorized more than a thousand facts

00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:21.140
Kim Peek was an amazing person who led an extraordinary life,

00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:26.560
who in a way led to a resurgence in interest and knowledge amongst the general populace

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:31.560
about autism and savants with that said, thank you so much for watching ladies and gentlemen
