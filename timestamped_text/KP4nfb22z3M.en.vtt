00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:16.840
Hello there Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to another episode of Cinema Summary~

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:19.100
Okay, that's enough clowning around.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.740
Welcome to another episode of Cinema Summary. Today we'll be looking at Christopher Nolan's The Dark Night.

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.740
A 2008 superhero film, directed, written and produced by Christopher Nolan.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.980
The day is darkest before the dawn, so allow me to enlighten you on:

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.480
Christopher Nolan’s THE DARK KNIGHT

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.170
A gang of criminals rob a Gotham City mob

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:44.200
bank, double-crossing and murdering each other
until only the mastermind remains: the Joker,

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.530
who escapes with the money.

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.420
The Joker: bank robber by day!
And bus driver by day!

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:48.940
And bus driver by day….

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.500
Gotta pay the bills, somehow

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.180
Batman, District Attorney Harvey Dent and

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.960
Lieutenant Jim Gordon form an alliance to
rid Gotham of organized crime

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.040
Bruce Wayne is impressed with Dent's idealism
and offers to support his career; he believes

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.180
that, with Dent as Gotham's protector, he
can give up being Batman and lead a normal

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.560
life with Rachel Dawes—even though she and
Dent are dating.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.490
Putting a dent into their relationship, if you know I mean

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.700
Mob bosses Gambol, Sal Maroni,and the Chechen
hold a videoconference with their corrupt

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.980
accountant, Lau, who has taken their funds
for safekeeping and fled to Hong Kong

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.720
The Joker interrupts, warns them that Batman
has no jurisdiction and is thus unhindered

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:31.880
by the law, and offers to kill him in exchange
for half of their money.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.100
After Gambol puts a bounty on his head, the
Joker kills Gambol and takes over his gang

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.479
looks like Gambol, gambled his life away.

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:41.270
The mob ultimately decides to take the Joker
up on his offer.

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.560
In the comics, the origin story of the Joker is this;

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.160
He was the leader of a gang called the "Red Hood Gang", and he was the 'Red Hood'.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.940
Together, they robbed the ACE Chemicals Factory, and he got into a fight with Batman

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.380
What happens was, by accident, he falls into a container full of chemicals

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:03.400
and goes insane, and transform into the Joker. Which is why he has the green hair, red lips, and pale skin

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.399
Batman finds Lau in Hong Kong and brings him
back to Gotham to testify, allowing Dent to

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:09.700
apprehend the entire mob.

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.950
The Joker threatens to keep killing people
unless Batman reveals his identity, and starts

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.880
by murdering Police Commissioner Gillian B. Loeb

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.340
and the judge presiding over the mob trial

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.150
The Joker also tries to kill Mayor Anthony
Garcia, but Gordon sacrifices himself to stop

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.719
the assassination.

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:30.200
Dent learns that Rachel is the next target
Bruce decides to reveal his secret identity.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.600
Before he can, however, Dent announces that
he is Batman.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.959
What? Wha-Dent! What are you doing? No stop! Dent!

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:42.280
Dent is taken into protective custody, but
the Joker appears and attacks the convoy

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.420
I put laughter in manslaughter

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.020
After all, 'slaughter' is the best medicine

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.400
Rachel and Dent are escorted away by detectives
on Maroni's payroll; Gordon later learns that

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.640
they never arrived home.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.160
Batman interrogates the Joker, who reveals
that they have been trapped in separate locations

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.750
rigged with explosives.

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.370
Batman races to save Rachel, while Gordon
attempts to rescue Dent.

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.461
Batman arrives at the building, but realizes
that the Joker sent him to Dent's location

00:03:07.461 --> 00:03:09.060
instead. PRANKED!

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.900
Both buildings explode, killing Rachel and
disfiguring half of Dent's face.

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.390
The Joker escapes with Lau, whom he later
kills along with the Chechen.

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.620
Coleman Reese, an accountant at Wayne Enterprises,
deduces that Bruce is Batman and tries to

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.750
go public with the information

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.800
Not wanting Reese's revelation to interfere
with his plans, the Joker threatens to destroy

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.500
a hospital unless someone kills Reese.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.349
Gordon orders the evacuation of all the hospitals
in Gotham and goes to secure Reese.

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:37.709
The Joker gives Dent a gun and convinces him
to seek revenge for Rachel's death, then destroys

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:40.209
the hospital and escapes with a busload of
hostages He really doesn’t have a plan?

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:41.209
Well i guess he’s a clown so he’s GOOD
AT IMPROVISING.

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:44.650
Dent goes on a killing spree, deciding the
fates of people he holds responsible for Rachel's

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.010
death by flipping his lucky coin.

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.080
After announcing Gotham will be subject to
his rule come nightfall, the Joker rigs two

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.900
evacuating ferries with explosives; one containing
civilians and the other containing prisoners

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.860
That's one trolley problem, I never want to be a part of.

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.980
He says that he will blow them both up by
midnight, but will let one live if its passengers

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:08.680
(who have been supplied the trigger to the
other boat's explosives) blow up the other ferry

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:14.600
Batman finds the Joker by using a sonar device
that spies on the entire city, with the reluctant

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.470
help of Lucius Fox.

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.870
Both the civilians and the prisoners refuse
to kill each other, while Batman apprehends

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.042
the Joker after a brief fight

00:04:22.042 --> 00:04:23.840
Easiest Boss
Fight ever.

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.590
Before the police arrive to take the Joker
into custody, he gloats that Gotham's citizens

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.430
will lose hope once Dent's rampage becomes
public knowledge.

00:04:31.599 --> 00:04:34.910
Gordon and Batman arrive at the building where
Rachel perished.

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:39.680
Dent shoots Batman, spares himself, and threatens
to kill Gordon's son, claiming that Gordon's

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.770
negligence is responsible for Rachel’s death.

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.530
Before he can flip for the boy, Batman, who
was wearing body armor, tackles Dent off the

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:47.560
building to his death DENT’S death, not
Batmans.

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:48.560
At least he wasn’t in the new movies, talk
about lucky.

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.940
Knowing the Joker would win if people found
out the truth, Batman persuades Gordon to

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.740
hold him responsible for the killing spree
to preserve Dent's heroic image

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:00.920
As the police launch a manhunt for Batman,
Gordon destroys the Bat-signal (COMIC BOOK REFERENCE)

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.120
Fox watches as the sonar device
self-destructs, and Alfred Pennyworth burns

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.370
a letter from Rachel saying she planned to
marry Dent.
