00:00:08.758 --> 00:00:13.200
Following 
the defeat of Deckard Shaw and Mose Jakande,

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:19.330
Dominic "Dom" Toretto and Letty Ortiz are
on their honeymoon in Havana when Dom's cousin

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.769
Fernando gets in trouble owing money to local
racer Raldo.

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:30.150
Sensing Raldo is a loan shark, Dom challenges
Raldo to a race, pitting Fernando's 1950 Chevrolet

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:37.720
Fleetline against Raldo's 1956 Ford Fairlane
Crown Victoria, and wagering his own 1961

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.020
Chevrolet Impala.

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.480
After narrowly winning the race (and destroying
the Fleetline in the process), Dom allows

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.130
Raldo to keep his car, saying his respect
is enough and leaves his cousin with his own

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:49.130
car.

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:54.910
The next day, an elusive cyberterrorist named
Cipher coerces Dom into working for her by

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.540
showing him an unseen photo or video on her
phone.

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:05.830
Shortly afterward, DSS agent Luke Hobbs recruits
Dom and his team, comprising of Letty, Roman

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:13.190
Pearce, Tej Parker, and Ramsey, to help him
retrieve an EMP device from a military outpost

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:14.190
in Berlin.

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.900
During the getaway, Dom goes rogue, forcing
Hobbs off the road and stealing the device

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:19.900
for Cipher.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:25.750
Hobbs gets arrested and locked up in the same
high-security prison which holds Deckard Shaw.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.840
After Deckard and Hobbs both escape the prison,
intelligence operative Mr. Nobody and his

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.860
protégé, Eric Reisner (dubbed Little Nobody
by Tej), recruits Deckard and Hobbs to help

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.670
the team find Dom and capture Cipher.

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.310
Deckard reveals that Cipher had hired his
brother Owen to steal the Nightshade device

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.540
and Mose Jakande to steal God's Eye, Ramsey's
software program from the last movie.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:52.380
The team tracks Dom and Cipher to their place,
moments before the latter two attack the base,

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.460
causing injuries to the team, and stealing
God's Eye.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.030
Roman suggests that they call Brian in to
help them on why Dom betrayed the team, but

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.200
Letty rejects the idea as they made a promise
not to bring him and Mia into any more dangerous

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.480
activities for the sake of their children.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:12.780
When Dom questions Cipher's motives, she reveals
that she has held hostage Dom's ex-lover and

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:18.450
DSS agent Elena Neves, and their son, of whose
existence Dom was unaware.

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.750
Elena tells Dom that she wanted him to decide
the child's first name, having already given

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.720
him the middle name Marcos.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:32.180
In New York City, Cipher sends Dom (in a 1971
Plymouth GTX) to retrieve a nuclear football

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.510
held by the Russian Minister of Defense.

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:40.150
Prior to the theft, Dom briefly evades Cipher—with
the help of Raldo—and persuades Deckard

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.390
and Owen's mother, Magdalene, to help him.

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.750
Cipher hacks into the electronics systems
of many cars, remotely controlling them via

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.300
auto drive, causing them to disable the convoy
so that Dom can take the football.

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:57.260
The team intercepts Dom in their vehicles,
but Dom escapes, shooting and seemingly killing

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:58.680
Deckard in the process.

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.990
Letty catches up to Dom, but is ambushed and
nearly killed by Cipher's enforcer, Connor

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:07.080
Rhodes, before Dom stops him from killing
Letty.

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.980
In retaliation, Cipher has Rhodes execute
a tied-up Elena in front of a helpless Dom.

00:03:11.961 --> 00:03:18.490
Dom, in a 1968 Dodge Charger, infiltrates
a military separatist base in Russia to use

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:24.190
the EMP device to disable their security and
to disable a nuclear submarine, enabling Cipher

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.340
to hijack it and attempt to use its arsenal
to trigger a nuclear war.

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:33.100
They are once again intercepted by the team,
who are able to shut down the sub's nuclear

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.470
weapons, and drive out toward the sea gate
that would prevent the sub from leaving into

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.460
open waters while being pursued by the separatists.

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:43.660
Meanwhile, Deckard, who faked his death,

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:49.510
teams up with Owen, and at Magdalene's
behest, infiltrates Cipher's plane to rescue Dom's son.

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:54.480
Once Deckard reports that the child is safe,
Dom turns on Cipher and kills Rhodes, before

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:55.940
rejoining his team.

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:00.720
Infuriated, Cipher fires an infrared homing
missile at Dom, but he breaks away from his

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.410
team and maneuvers around it, causing the
missile to hit the submarine instead, causing

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:07.550
an explosion that destroys Dom's vehicle.

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:12.040
The team quickly forms a vehicular blockade
around Dom, shielding him from the ensuing

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.680
explosion as the submarine is destroyed.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.759
Deckard reaches the front of the plane and
confronts Cipher, who escapes by jumping from

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:20.370
the plane with a parachute.

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:25.930
Mr. Nobody and his protégé visit Dom and
his team in New York City to report that Cipher

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:27.580
is still at large in Athens.

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:32.599
Hobbs has his record cleared and is offered
his DSS job back, but he declines in order to spend

00:04:32.599 --> 00:04:34.090
more time with his daughter.

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:39.020
Deckard delivers Dom his son, putting his
differences aside with Dom and Hobbs.

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.500
Dom names his son Brian and celebrates with
his friends.
