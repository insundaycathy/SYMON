00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.330
Welcome to Movie Shortens.

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:04.330
Follow us today to a movie titled: Crawl.

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:07.110
Be aware, there are spoilers!

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:11.469
The movie starts with Haley Keller clad in
a swimsuit ready to compete in a race.

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:16.880
During the race, Haley has flashbacks to a
race she participated in as a child, with

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.120
her coach and father cheering her on from
the side of the pool.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.190
She finishes in a position she is clearly
disappointed with.

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:26.600
After showering, Haley opens her locker and
checks her phone.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.450
She has missed a call from her sister so she
rings her back.

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:32.529
In the video conversation that follows her
sister, Beth, warns Haley that a storm is

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:35.129
on its way and she should leave the state.

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:39.140
However, she also mentions that she has been
unable to contact their father to determine

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:40.329
his whereabouts.

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:43.960
Haley, concerned at the lack of a response
from her father, drives through the rain and

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.399
wind in the direction of his condo.

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:49.679
She is unable to locate her father here, so
decides to visit their old family home, which

00:00:49.679 --> 00:00:51.879
we learn has been up for sale for sometime.

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:57.659
En route, she is forced to stop at a roadblock
being manned by Beth’s ex, a police officer

00:00:57.659 --> 00:00:58.789
named Wayne.

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:03.170
Wayne informs Haley that she is not allowed
to pass and must head back the way she came.

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:08.480
Haley, however, makes a snap decision to push
on to swerve away from the police and accelerates

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:09.910
away down a muddy track.

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:14.890
Upon arrival at the house, Hayley is greeted
by the family dog, Sugar, who she apologizes

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.869
to for having been away so long.

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:20.570
It is now revealed that Haley has not been
on good terms with her father.

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.869
She is unable to find him on either floor
of the house, so she follows some steps down

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.860
to the crawl area below the floorboards.

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.990
It is dark and all wet down there and she
is forced to make her way along on her hands

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.840
and knees through the mud and dirt.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.674
Her concern for her father grows as she sees
some abandoned tools.

00:01:36.674 --> 00:01:40.509
She gets in earshot of his radio but is still
unable to elicit a response from him when

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:42.079
she calls out to him.

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:47.810
Eventually, Haley finds her father, Dave,
lying face down on the floor, clearly unconscious.

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.920
As she turns him over, we can see deep lacerations
across his shoulder and his leg has been fractured

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.570
so severely that the bones are showing.

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:00.100
Fortunately, he is still breathing and she
is able to use some water to revive him.

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.659
Initially, he seems annoyed that she has come.

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:07.280
Before Hayley is able to make a call for help,
she is alerted to the presence of an alligator.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.230
Haley and her dad scatter, and both take refuge
behind a row of metal pipes which the alligators

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.270
prove incapable of passing.

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.800
However, the father and daughter are separated.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.510
At this point, against her father’s advice,
Hayley heads back into the danger zone beyond

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.980
the pipes in pursuit of her phone.

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.480
Before she can make a call of any note, she
is attacked by an alligator and loses hold

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.530
of the phone.

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.450
It is later crushed under the weight of one
of the two alligators now tracking her.

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.000
Although she is bitten on the leg, she makes
it back to the pipes.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.670
She gets away by repeatedly stabbing an alligator
in the eye with a screwdriver.

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.840
Throughout this time, Haley has had access
to a wind up torch.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.519
Next, she uses this to try and draw attention
to three people she spots at a nearby gas

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:51.519
station.

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:56.330
The people are looting it and have just managed
to load its ATM machine onto a boat.

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.970
The older male catches sight of the light
beam shining through a grate.

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:05.370
He begins walking across the street to investigate,
with the water level nearly up to his waist.

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.569
Behind him, we see the female of the group,
who is in the boat, being attacked by yet

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:09.950
another alligator.

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.269
She is viciously and mercilessly killed, while
he is bitten on the leg too.

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:17.840
With his younger brother still in the shop,
he manages to scramble back to the shop and

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:18.840
attempts to warn him.

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.700
It is too late though and within seconds both
of them are killed tragically.

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.790
Back in the basement, Dave has a plan.

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.270
He instructs Haley to locate a hatch leading
up through the floor.

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:30.549
She does so and tries to force it open.

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:32.870
As she attempts this, Sugar comes to greet
her.

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.910
Unfortunately, however, the lid keeps catching
under the lip of a piece of furniture and

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:38.459
it refuses to give up.

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.170
They remain trapped.

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.140
Soon the two of them have their hopes of an
escape revived when Wayne arrives on a police

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:45.140
boat.

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.920
His partner waits outside while Wayne enters
the house.

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.250
The pair underneath the floor attempt to warn
him about the presence of the alligators but

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.290
he is unable to hear them due to the howling
storm.

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.059
While his partner is torn apart outside near
a children’s swing by a group of the reptiles,

00:03:57.059 --> 00:04:00.709
Wayne is dragged into the basement where he
wrestles with his attacker.

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:03.890
Despite Haley’s attempts to assist, he loses
the fight.

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:07.430
With the water levels rising rapidly, the
father and his daughter learn that they are

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.299
in danger from both the predators in their
midst and from drowning.

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:14.659
In desperation, Haley decides to make for
the flood drain.

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:19.680
Her father pleads with her not to, as he knows
the alligators use this to come and go.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.810
On her way to it, she finds herself in an
alligator’s nest surrounded by eggs.

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.900
She tries to remain silent to avoid attracting
their attention, but when she sees Wayne’s

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.060
corpse floating nearby, she reels it in and
takes his service weapon.

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:35.620
An alligator soon attacks and bites her arm,
but with her hand inside its throat she is

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.680
able to get several shots off and kills it,
thereby freeing her arm.

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.370
Ever more determined, Haley clambers up the
flood drain and swims into the street, evading

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.650
any alligators in the water nearby.

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:51.410
She smashes a window to enter the house, clambers
through and begins hacking away at the floorboards.

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:56.300
Beneath them, with the water having risen
significantly, her father is drowning.

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:00.460
She hauls him through the gap she has made,
but finds that he is no longer breathing.

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.279
Haley attempts to resuscitate him using mouth
to mouth and CPR.

00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:07.080
At first he doesn’t respond, but when she
becomes desperate and hits him harder in the

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.389
chest, he splutters back into life.

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:13.440
With the two of them now on their feet, they
head into the street.

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.430
Dave has warned his daughter that the flood
defenses will soon break and they need to

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:18.430
get out.

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.750
He tells her the looters’ boat at the gas
station is their only option.

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:25.639
Taking Sugar in his arms, he leads Haley across
the street on foot, reassuring her that if

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:28.520
they don’t make a splash they will not be
attacked.

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:32.820
His words ring true and they stand like statues
as a large alligator brushes past them.

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:37.530
A crack of thunder and some ominous looking
skies soon force a change in plan.

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:41.550
Time is running out and Dave tells Haley she
needs to swim to the boat.

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:45.520
The former swimming coach in him comes out
as he builds her confidence, telling her she

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.300
is faster than their attackers.

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:51.370
She follows his wishes and makes it to the
boat, quickly starting the engine and turning

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:52.370
it around.

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:55.560
She scoops up her dad and the dogs in seconds.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.039
Almost immediately, the flood defenses then
give way.

00:05:58.039 --> 00:06:01.530
The resulting surge of water means they are
unable to control the boat.

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:06.220
It is sent smashing back through the front
window of their house with them onboard.

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:10.980
It capsizes on impact and its three passengers
are left scattered around the house.

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:15.530
While Haley attempts to evade the alligators
in the kitchen, Dave makes it to the stairs,

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:19.120
but soon leaves his position of relative safety
to get Sugar.

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:23.349
As Sugar swims towards him, an alligator spots
Dave and wrestles with him, tearing off his

00:06:23.349 --> 00:06:24.870
arm in the encounter.

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:29.150
Much as he had done with his leg earlier,
Dave binds his arm to stop the bleeding.

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:34.780
Meanwhile, Hayley is able to broadcast a distress
signal using a police radio she locates floating

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:36.240
on the surface of the water.

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:40.699
However, when attempting to make it to the
stairs, she is cornered by an alligator and

00:06:40.699 --> 00:06:42.419
retreats into the bathroom.

00:06:42.419 --> 00:06:45.500
She takes refuge in the shower, protected
by its door.

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:49.560
The water level is rising again though, so
she knows she needs to take action.

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:54.669
She opens the door, luring the alligator in
and uses the soap dish as a foothold to step

00:06:54.669 --> 00:07:00.319
over the shower’s partition, in order to
close the door and trap the reptile inside.

00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:03.050
Not long after, she is reunited with her father.

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:06.639
They realize a rescue helicopter is searching
for people in need.

00:07:06.639 --> 00:07:09.220
Haley makes for a window to try and signal
to it.

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:12.440
She is soon engaged in a struggle for her
life with another alligator though.

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:16.990
It has a tight hold on her and attempts to
drown her by repeatedly rolling her over and

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:18.690
over below the surface.

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:23.229
Haley struggles for consciousness, but is
inspired by more flashbacks to her childhood.

00:07:23.229 --> 00:07:25.310
She clutches at an abandoned flair.

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:29.751
After several attempts, she is able to grab
a hold of it, ignite it and use it to stab

00:07:29.751 --> 00:07:31.550
the alligator in the eye.

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:36.440
She gets away, rejoins the others, and, despite
the presence of yet another reptilian adversary,

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:38.540
they make it to the roof.

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:42.560
Though her father is severely injured and
Haley has also been wounded, they are relieved

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:44.729
and clearly happy to have made it out.

00:07:44.729 --> 00:07:50.430
The movie ends with Haley hailing the helicopter
using a flare, with her dad gazing on in appreciation,

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:54.260
amazed at how strong his daughter has proven
to be.
