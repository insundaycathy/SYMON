00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.680
Welcome back to Movie Recaps.&nbsp;
Today I will show you a Russian&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:08.960
sci-fi film from 2020, called Invasion.
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:14.240
It's been 3 years since the aliens arrived&nbsp;
on Earth unnoticed. The planet is securing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.840
it's defenses, with USA, Russia and China leading&nbsp;
the way. A new satellite is being deployed in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.560
orbit around Earth meant to monitor deep space,&nbsp;
so that no alien object can approach the planet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:30.400
unnoticed again. As the satellite opens, a strange&nbsp;
alien ship can be seen, moving it's tentacle like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:36.560
parts. Suddenly, a shuttle deploys from it, heads&nbsp;
to Earth and enters the atmosphere. Meanwhile,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:41.520
somewhere in the ocean, a fishing boat can&nbsp;
be seen, with fishermen working and chatting.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.920
One of them looks out over the water and sees&nbsp;
the alien shuttle drop. He doesn't share what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.960
he saw with the others. Next, the shuttle can&nbsp;
be seen as it moves underwater like a submarine.&nbsp;

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:57.200
Four months later, Yulya is seen jogging with&nbsp;
her dog. As they come into an apartment complex,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.280
the dog escapes and doesn't come back for&nbsp;
her calls. She tells the men that are with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.400
her to help find him. Later, as she's sitting in&nbsp;
robotics class, her friend asks her about some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.360
new information from the lab. She tells him that&nbsp;
if she shares any information, her guards will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.640
have to shoot him on the spot. After the class,&nbsp;
Yulya's friend tries to express his love for her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.320
but she knowingly stops him, saying that&nbsp;
he'll be safer if they remain friends.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.640
Her guards escort them to her fathers car. Her&nbsp;
father, general Lebedev, talks to Yulya's friend,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.600
calling him Google. The kid brags that he works&nbsp;
at Rostelekom and they drop him off there.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.080
He enters the building and when security asks&nbsp;
for his ID, it shows that he's just an intern.&nbsp;

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.760
Meanwhile, Yulya and her dad are still driving&nbsp;
and he jokes with her about breaking her out and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:47.040
smuggling her to another country, where she could&nbsp;
lay low. She doesn't want him to get suspended.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.360
They arrive in a research laboratory of the&nbsp;
Russian ministry of defense, where a robot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.720
is seen tearing through the doors and smashing a&nbsp;
car. Yulya's dad talks to a scientist at the lab,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.440
asking about it. The scientist explains&nbsp;
that it's some kind of biotechnology.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.880
The robot is being controlled by a human, talking&nbsp;
with them over com. The general comments that it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.600
a Russian-extraterrestrial coproduction. The&nbsp;
scientist then explains that Yulya is the key&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:17.280
to understanding how all of it works. Meanwhile,&nbsp;
somewhere in the facility, Yulya is taking part&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.760
in an experiment. The main scientist interrogates&nbsp;
her about her encounter with the extraterrestrial&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.880
spacecraft and monitors her reactions, not just&nbsp;
her answers. When he asks her about her friend&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.280
that died in the encounter, her heart rate spikes&nbsp;
and then again when he asks why she helped the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:37.440
alien. They ask her about her boyfriend Artyom and&nbsp;
she gets upset, not wanting to answer. Suddenly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.480
the boyfriend is brought into the lab. He starts&nbsp;
talking to her and she get incredibly upset,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.440
telling the scientist to stop the experiment&nbsp;
and get her out. He apologizes for killing her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.400
as she tries to reap through her restraints. As&nbsp;
he keeps talking, the scientist encourages him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.720
and suddenly there's a giant surge of power.&nbsp;
Her father runs into the lab and gets her out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.200
of the pool, while Artyom is being escorted&nbsp;
asking why he's locked up, when she is free.&nbsp;

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.480
Later, Yulya and her father talk and she begs&nbsp;
him to let her be alone for a moment, without&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.680
her guards or anyone else around her. He agrees&nbsp;
and leaves, then meets with a soldier, Ivan,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.560
telling him that he'll have to pull a night shift&nbsp;
and to change in some regular clothes. That night,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.760
Yulya is drinking at a bar. She spots Ivan and&nbsp;
buys him a drink to let him know she's onto him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.880
so he joins her at the bar. She offers him a drink&nbsp;
before they leave, but a second man appears saying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:32.000
they have to go. The man introduces himself as&nbsp;
Hakon and says Yulya needs to come with him, even&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.960
though she doesn't want to. Ivan and Hakon start&nbsp;
fighting, but Yulya hits the soldier over the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:42.880
head, knocking him out. Her and Hakon leave the&nbsp;
bar and call the alien spaceship, Sol. It tracks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:48.000
where they are and finds them a ride, leading them&nbsp;
to a car with two passengers. It takes over the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.200
digitalized car and starts driving it. Sol talks&nbsp;
to them over the com and Ivan catches up to them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.320
The car manages to push Ivan away and drives off,&nbsp;
being careful not to hurt people on the road.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.360
Ivan catches up to them again with a motorcycle&nbsp;
and calls general Lebedev to inform him of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:08.480
situation. The general tells him to follow them,&nbsp;
but starts evacuating the laboratory of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.320
ministry of defense, under the explanation&nbsp;
that the aliens have come back to Earth.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.880
Back in the car, Hakon tells Yulya that she's&nbsp;
in danger because they went to far with the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:22.400
experiments, so they have to fly away immediately.&nbsp;
The car is speeding and almost hits a pedestrian,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.400
but instantly stops in front of him,&nbsp;
telling the other passengers to get out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:31.040
Hakon and Yulya continue riding in the car, Ivan&nbsp;
pursues after them and shoots one of the wheels.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.680
He causes a car accident, but Sol tracks&nbsp;
him from above and manages to save him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.200
Ivan calls the general to tell him he lost them.
Sol drives Hakon and Yulya to a remote place in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:46.160
the middle of the woods. She reluctantly walks&nbsp;
in, but she's suddenly greeted by her dog that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:51.520
there. Yulya tells Hakon that she thought he was&nbsp;
dead. It seems that he was the alien she helped in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:56.800
the previous encounter. He says that the previous&nbsp;
time everything went wrong. They go inside the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:01.360
house and they talk about how he's been living on&nbsp;
Earth. He tells her that he has adapted to life&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:07.280
on the planet. Someone knocks on the door and when&nbsp;
Yulya opens it, she sees it's Google. She's angry,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.440
even though that was what he tried to tell her&nbsp;
before. Hakon tells her that he was supposed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:15.680
to leave after the first encounter, but he&nbsp;
violated the protocol and stayed on Sol,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:22.080
close to Earth. They kiss and make love, as Sol&nbsp;
is seen changing its form. It turns into Ra. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.800
next morning, Yulya calls her dad and tells&nbsp;
him that she's with Hakon. She tells him that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.800
she has to leave, because she doesn't belong&nbsp;
on Earth anymore and asks him not to tell.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:36.480
Nevertheless, the general orders his men to&nbsp;
track her signal. Yulya walks back in the house,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:41.520
where Hakon is waiting for her with breakfast.
Meanwhile, a tactical unit has surrounded the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:46.160
house with Hakon and Yulya inside and is&nbsp;
ready to storm it. General Lebedev tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:50.960
them to stand down, but Ra intercepts the call and&nbsp;
changes the general's command to shoot to kill.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:55.040
The unit enters the house, Hakon&nbsp;
fights a few of the soldiers off,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:59.120
then the two of them escape. His ship is&nbsp;
activated and waiting for them at the river.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:04.000
Hakon jumps in, but the unit follows them and&nbsp;
shoots Yulya as she is getting into the ship.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:09.680
Hakon flies away. Suddenly an order comes in to&nbsp;
launch a missile at them, but Hakon eliminates the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:14.800
missile mid air. The ship is still damaged though&nbsp;
and it falls through the sky and into the river.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:19.200
Hakon tries to reach Sol, but Ra tells him&nbsp;
that Yulya needs to be eliminated before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:23.760
it can repair he's ship. He declines and Ra&nbsp;
tells him that he needs to be eliminated too.&nbsp;

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:28.960
The general and Ivan try to catch up to them,&nbsp;
receiving different kinds of miscommunication&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:33.680
that Ra has intercepted. They find out that&nbsp;
space defense is after the ship, with the general&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:38.880
confused as to who gave that order. Helicopters&nbsp;
are seen charging toward the river, switching to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:44.080
combat mode and shooting at the ship. Back in the&nbsp;
facility, Artyom tricks his guard and manages to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:48.640
get inside the robot, steal it and run away in it.&nbsp;
He gets to a bridge on the river and hears that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:53.600
there is a unit after the ship, ready to shoot&nbsp;
them down. The ship glides through the water,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:58.320
but gets shot by two helicopters. It flies&nbsp;
out of the water and falls through the air,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:03.760
with water following it. Eventually it crashes&nbsp;
on the ground. The helicopters are in position,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:07.920
getting the kill order from Ra, when Artyom&nbsp;
in the robot suit jumps at one of them and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:12.960
rips it to shreds. On the ground, the general&nbsp;
gets to the ship and goes to check for Yulya,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:18.240
but her and Hakon have already escaped. He carries&nbsp;
her to an ambulance, when they find Artyom,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:22.800
who sees that she's hurt and tells them he'll get&nbsp;
a doctor for her. But Hakon tells him that all she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:27.760
needs is water. Artyom flags down a car and they&nbsp;
steal it, leaving its owner behind this time.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:33.440
While they're driving Hakon explains how powerful&nbsp;
Sol is and how it can control human technology.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:37.200
Artyom asks what it wants and he tells&nbsp;
him that it only wants to eliminate Yulya.&nbsp;

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:42.240
In the meantime, Yulya's father goes to the&nbsp;
ministry of defense, where a special meeting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:46.800
has been summoned. He storms the meeting asking&nbsp;
why such orders were placed when they were chasing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:51.120
the ship. The vice-premier tells him that he&nbsp;
is out of line and gets ordered to sit down.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:56.080
Then he asks the space defense to explain&nbsp;
their actions. They say the orders came from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.080 --> 00:08:00.880
the general. A recording is played where the&nbsp;
general's voice can be heard giving the order.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:05.120
The vice-premier orders the news to be played&nbsp;
in the meeting, where the devastation in Moscow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:09.280
from the chase is apparent. The media is&nbsp;
blaming Yulya for what happened and play&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:14.080
a deep fake video of her, making her sound like&nbsp;
a terrorist, that's on the side of the aliens,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:19.280
threatening the city. They reveal that not only&nbsp;
the video, but the entire news program is fake,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:24.000
being broadcast from someplace else and not&nbsp;
a TV station. The general tells them that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.040
the aliens are the ones doing it. He asks for&nbsp;
retaliation, to which the vice-premier says he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:34.080
needs evidence so he can confirm such action.&nbsp;
General Lebedev asks for special protocols to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:38.480
be put in place in the meantime, saying that&nbsp;
only analogue technology should be used for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:42.960
all of their communication. The vice-premier&nbsp;
agrees and preparations begin for the switch.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:49.440
Simultaneously, Hakon, Yulya and Artyom get to a&nbsp;
store to get water for her. Hakon goes inside to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:54.320
buy it. When he finds the right kind of water and&nbsp;
goes to the register, the phones of all the people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:59.680
start ringing. Everyone in the store is talking&nbsp;
about Yulya and a possible terror attack. All&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:04.320
of the people start getting the same message about&nbsp;
her, that they need to find her and eliminate her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:09.360
As Hakon returns to the car, a woman in the&nbsp;
adjacent car recognizes Yulya and informs a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:14.160
police patrol that's in her vicinity about her.&nbsp;
Artyom drives away as the police start chasing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:19.440
them. Ivan gets the same message, while escorting&nbsp;
the ship back to the ministry of defense.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:24.800
The fake message tells him the attack caused by&nbsp;
Yulya has injured his son. All digital media gets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:29.200
swamped by Ra with the same information about&nbsp;
Yulya, making her public enemy number one.&nbsp;

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.040
Google gets a visit from a police officer asking&nbsp;
about Yulya. His grandmother sends the officer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:39.680
away and when they close the door asks where&nbsp;
he hid his friends. They were in the closet.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:45.120
The next moment, Artyom and Hakon submerge Yulya&nbsp;
in water. Hakon tells him that she's no longer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:50.240
human. He says pain is changing her, making&nbsp;
her extremely, if not dangerously powerful.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:54.800
Ra has calculated that her death might save&nbsp;
everyone else from her power and that's why it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:54.800 --> 00:10:00.240
wants to destroy her. Later, Google and Artyom get&nbsp;
Hakon drunk intentionally and decide to take him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:06.000
to the ministry of defense. Artyom gives Google&nbsp;
no choice on the matter. Once they arrive, they're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.560
greeted by Yulya's father ready to kill them.&nbsp;
Google breaks and tells him where his daughter is.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:15.600
He confronts Hakon and asks him to tell him the&nbsp;
coordinates of Ra, which is known solely to him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:20.240
and tells him that he has to decide between her&nbsp;
and his people. Ivan tries to get in touch with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:25.600
his wife, but he can't. He sees the news about&nbsp;
Yulya, as the general walks in telling his men&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:29.680
to prepare an observatory and the satellite&nbsp;
with the coordinates he got from Hakon.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:34.400
The general tells Ivan to get Yulya, but bring&nbsp;
her to him directly, without informing anyone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:39.600
else. The observatory locates Ra, so the general&nbsp;
contacts the vice-premier about the next step.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:44.720
They decide to engage with it violently but need&nbsp;
to destroy a satellite, so that it doesn't catch&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:49.520
up to what they're doing and create different&nbsp;
problems. The military sends Google to Rostelekom&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:54.480
to take down their satellite. Once the satellite&nbsp;
is down, they will only have a few seconds before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:59.280
it reboots. They will destroy Ra with a super&nbsp;
secret weapon that the vice-premier pretends they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:04.560
don't even have, even though they do. The general&nbsp;
convinces him that they have no other choice.&nbsp;

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:08.000
Meanwhile, Yulya wakes up in&nbsp;
the tub. Her wounds are gone.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:13.040
She gets ready to leave Google's grandmother's&nbsp;
apartment, when Ivan shows up at the door.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:17.120
He's driving her someplace, but she doesn't know&nbsp;
that he thinks she's to blame for the attacks.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:23.040
He confronts her with the information, threatening&nbsp;
her that if his son dies, so will she. The general&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:27.440
gives the order to launch the special missile&nbsp;
and destroy the satellite as well. They wait&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:33.040
for the missile to destroy Ra and rejoice when&nbsp;
it's done. But, the general isn't convinced. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:37.520
wants a full report and a visual confirmation&nbsp;
to make sure the alien spaceship is destroyed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:42.160
In the meantime, people gather on the&nbsp;
streets and demand for Yulya's prosecution.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:47.440
Ivan is driving her through the crowd. He still&nbsp;
doesn't believe her, but he eventually takes her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:52.160
to the ministry to her father and the others. Ivan&nbsp;
is disappointed with the general and quits on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:58.160
spot. Hakon uses a phone to communicate with Ra.&nbsp;
It tells him that it is ready for retribution,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:02.880
since it doesn't believe humans are worthy of&nbsp;
anything. Ra tells Hakon that he can fly back,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:08.320
but he declines, still believing in mankind. The&nbsp;
powerful spaceship starts a process of destruction&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:13.680
on the planet seen from everywhere, including the&nbsp;
tower of the Ministry of defense. Ra is angry at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:18.800
the humans for trying to use its technology to&nbsp;
create weapons like Yulya. It creates a massive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:23.680
water dome around the area of Moscow where she&nbsp;
is and starts flooding the inside of the walls.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:28.960
The military tries everything, but they can't&nbsp;
destroy the dome. They start evacuating people,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:32.960
only to tell them that their only hope if to go&nbsp;
as high up as they can and remain on the roofs of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:38.320
the buildings. The general tells Hakon to grab&nbsp;
Yulya and get her to the chopper on the roof.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:42.720
So, he gets her and Artyom there and inside&nbsp;
of the helicopter, but remains in the dome.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:47.280
Hakon comes back to the general and asks for&nbsp;
his shuttle, telling him that he can try and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:52.400
destroy Ra if he can hit it with the shuttle.&nbsp;
The general, realizing it's a one way ticket,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:56.720
wants to go instead, but that's not possible&nbsp;
since only Hakon can operate it manually.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:01.920
The general evacuates his men, but remains&nbsp;
behind to help Hakon navigate toward Ra.&nbsp;

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:05.680
The helicopter with Yulya and Artyom&nbsp;
looses altitude and has to land,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:10.400
but it starts falling and the two of them jump out&nbsp;
in the water. They are pulled on one of the roofs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:15.280
with the other people in the disaster area. The&nbsp;
water keeps getting higher and Yulya can't accept&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:20.480
that all the people can get hurt because of her,&nbsp;
so she surrenders. She asks Artyom to kill her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:25.440
and the others around them hear her. Meanwhile,&nbsp;
the general manages to get Hakon as close to Ra&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:30.560
as he possibly can, until the water comes inside&nbsp;
the building and floods it. Back at the roof,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:35.840
Yulya is begging to die, wanting to end all the&nbsp;
suffering she's caused. Ivan is there and he sees&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:41.680
her, going after her with a gun. Artyom tries&nbsp;
to protect her, but gets shot instead. The water&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:47.360
starts closing in on them, but Ivan has lost his&nbsp;
nerve. The water overtakes them. Hakon is getting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:52.960
closer and closer to Ra, eventually speeding the&nbsp;
ship towards it. Under the water, Yulya's bracelet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:58.320
activates and sends streams of water toward Ra,&nbsp;
as Hakon gets closer to it too. Yulya pulls Ra&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:03.280
out of the water and military helicopters start&nbsp;
shooting at it as they see it. Yulya keeps pushing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:08.080
the ship out and the military drops a missile&nbsp;
on it, destroying it. Suddenly the water starts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:14.000
receding and people start coming up for air. The&nbsp;
general is still alive as well. Hakon's ship gets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.960
pushed back in the remaining water, as Ra is&nbsp;
dying. He appears on the roof next to Yulya.&nbsp;

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:22.400
The alien threat has been destroyed&nbsp;
and the day saved yet again.&nbsp;

00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:27.920
In the final moments, the general attends&nbsp;
a fake funeral for his daughter. And later,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:32.800
a helicopter flies over Kamchatka. One person&nbsp;
leaves the plane and walks off with the dog.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:38.880
It's the general tracking a specific location and&nbsp;
when he gets there, he finds Yulya and Hakon. They&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:43.840
embrace and wonder where to go next. Yulya touches&nbsp;
the water and a spaceship appears from below.
