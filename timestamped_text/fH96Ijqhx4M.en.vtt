00:00:11.841 --> 00:00:13.185
hey what's up guys

00:00:13.313 --> 00:00:17.409
today I'll show you a psychological slasher film: "House of Wax" 

00:00:17.665 --> 00:00:20.225
spoiler ahead, watch out and take care

00:00:21.761 --> 00:00:27.201
in the flashback of the year 1974, a woman was boiling a pot of unknown liquid

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:29.889
while her son was having his delicious breakfast

00:00:30.145 --> 00:00:32.705
and her husband was pulling another son into a room 

00:00:33.025 --> 00:00:36.225
that child seemed very disobedient and kept crying

00:00:36.609 --> 00:00:40.513
the parents tied the child to a chair, but the child still bawled

00:00:40.641 --> 00:00:43.073
so the mother slapped him on the face

00:00:44.097 --> 00:00:45.313
in the present day

00:00:45.377 --> 00:00:49.345
while Carly and her close friend Blonde are happily talking about their future 

00:00:49.537 --> 00:00:52.545
Carly's boyfriend Wade comes and sits beside her

00:00:52.993 --> 00:00:57.153
so Blonde says goodbye and leaves for her boyfriend Hormone Long

00:00:57.729 --> 00:01:02.849
then Carly's elder brother Half Bald and his gayfriend Red Cap come and join them

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:06.497
Wade and Half Bald seem not get along well with each other

00:01:06.561 --> 00:01:10.785
and it upsets Carly for one is her brother, and the other is her boyfriend

00:01:11.489 --> 00:01:15.457
later, these six young guys drive to another city to watch a football game

00:01:15.905 --> 00:01:19.500
when the night falls, they decide to stop and find some place to camp

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.341
before continuing their journey the next morning 

00:01:22.884 --> 00:01:25.764
at the campsite, Half Bald and Wade quarrel again

00:01:26.148 --> 00:01:28.964
Carly asks her brother to be nicer to her boyfriend

00:01:29.092 --> 00:01:32.292
which makes Half Bald very unhappy about his sister

00:01:32.932 --> 00:01:37.284
while the six friends are having fun, a truck comes toward them with the high beams on

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.652
the strong beams hurt Half Bald's eyes

00:01:40.292 --> 00:01:44.004
he gets angry and throws a stone toward the light, breaking it

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.524
then the truck turns around and goes away

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.940
feeling tired, the young guys crawl into their camps to sleep

00:01:52.644 --> 00:01:54.244
when they wake up the next morning

00:01:54.372 --> 00:01:56.804
Wade finds his car has a flat tire

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.556
and the girls smell something stink in the air

00:02:00.004 --> 00:02:02.116
they try to find where the stink comes from

00:02:02.244 --> 00:02:04.356
the girls walk deep into the grove 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.476
there they find a pit filled with corpses, it is where the stink smell comes from	

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:13.060
Carly falls into the terrifying pit by accident

00:02:13.188 --> 00:02:15.300
but the bad luck never comes alone

00:02:15.812 --> 00:02:20.484
suddenly a car comes near, the driver is a creepy man wearing a green hat

00:02:21.252 --> 00:02:25.540
the friends decide that Wade and Carly go to the nearby town to buy auto parts

00:02:25.668 --> 00:02:27.908
and others set out again to the football game

00:02:28.612 --> 00:02:31.748
on hearing their discussion, the green-hatted guy cuts in 

00:02:31.876 --> 00:02:33.988
offering a ride for the young couple 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.444
so Wade and Carly merrily get into his car 

00:02:38.084 --> 00:02:41.156
but the green-hatted guy behaves rather weird on the way

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.484
he can not move his eyes and hormones away from Carly

00:02:44.996 --> 00:02:48.068
later he takes out a huge machete and plays with it

00:02:48.132 --> 00:02:51.780
which nearly scares the shit and hormones out of the young lovers

00:02:52.484 --> 00:02:56.132
finally they arrive at the town, but the small town seems haunted 

00:02:56.196 --> 00:02:58.308
for they see nobody in the streets

00:02:58.948 --> 00:03:00.484
the young lovers wander about 

00:03:00.548 --> 00:03:04.004
and find out that all the people are attending a funeral in the church

00:03:04.516 --> 00:03:07.700
the fat-greasy guy, manager of the gas station 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.084
comes out and consoles the worried lovers

00:03:10.192 --> 00:03:14.480
saying he will ride them to the gas station as soon as the funeral is over

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.912
so the young lovers take their time

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.984
and curiously walk around in the town named Ambrose

00:03:20.432 --> 00:03:22.352
they come to the House of Wax

00:03:22.544 --> 00:03:25.616
when inside they discover everything is made of wax

00:03:25.808 --> 00:03:28.432
and the wax figures are stunningly realistic

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.544
while they are looking around

00:03:30.608 --> 00:03:34.128
Carly sees from the mirror a disfigured man passing by 

00:03:34.704 --> 00:03:38.736
frightened, she takes her boyfriend's hand, and they quickly run away

00:03:39.312 --> 00:03:42.384
Greasy rides the couple to his home right after the funeral 

00:03:42.512 --> 00:03:47.824
Carly waits in the car and Wade follows Greasy into his house for automobile parts

00:03:48.464 --> 00:03:50.960
while he gazes here and there with curiosity 

00:03:51.024 --> 00:03:53.264
Greasy hamstrings him from the back

00:03:53.968 --> 00:03:58.000
the disfigured man reappears and stuns Wade before taking him away 

00:03:58.768 --> 00:04:03.248
while waiting, Carly sees the truck whose light was hit broken by Half Bald

00:04:03.568 --> 00:04:06.000
it parks right in front of Greasy's house

00:04:06.256 --> 00:04:10.352
she then is aware of great danger, so she sounds the horn to warn Wade

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.592
and calls Hormone Long for help

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.832
but Hormone Long does not answer the phone

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:18.544
for he is busy with the horny hormone game right at that time

00:04:19.376 --> 00:04:21.296
when Greasy comes out of the house

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.984
Carly exposes that he is the truck driver 

00:04:24.112 --> 00:04:29.040
Greasy then shows his greasy colors, but Carly is swift enough to pick up the key

00:04:29.488 --> 00:04:31.920
she starts the engine and drives away

00:04:32.496 --> 00:04:34.288
while Wade has no such good luck

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.784
he is wax coated by the disfigured man

00:04:36.848 --> 00:04:41.840
which well explains why all the wax figures in the wax house are stunningly realistic

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.000
Carly runs to the church for help, but is astonished to find out that 

00:04:46.256 --> 00:04:51.248
people sitting in the church are not real humans but all all wax-coated corpses

00:04:51.888 --> 00:04:54.896
she realizes suddenly that all the people in the small town

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.456
were murdered and made into waxed figures 

00:04:57.968 --> 00:05:01.616
when Greasy approaches near, Carly is seized with panic

00:05:01.872 --> 00:05:04.752
he takes her soon and drags her down to the basement

00:05:04.816 --> 00:05:08.208
ties her to the chair and seals her mouth with glue 

00:05:08.976 --> 00:05:12.624
Red Cap and Half Bald come to the town to look for Carly and Wade 

00:05:13.008 --> 00:05:15.824
they search around in vain, but Carly sees them

00:05:16.208 --> 00:05:18.832
she stretches out her fingers from the louver of the basement

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.688
trying to cause their attention

00:05:21.008 --> 00:05:24.144
but right then, Greasy cuts her fingers off with scissors

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.176
as Red Cap and Half Bald walk away to look for Carly elsewhere

00:05:28.304 --> 00:05:30.608
they become Greasy's next targets

00:05:30.928 --> 00:05:35.664
enduring excruciating pain, Carly removes the glue off her mouth 

00:05:35.792 --> 00:05:37.712
and cries for help with all her strength

00:05:38.032 --> 00:05:42.448
Half Bald hears the sound, and realizes that his sister is nearby

00:05:42.512 --> 00:05:44.944
he punches Greasy to the ground

00:05:45.648 --> 00:05:48.976
following Carly's cry, he rescues her out of the basement 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.944
Red Cap finds Wade who has been wax-coated

00:05:53.136 --> 00:05:57.040
however, the wax is not dry yet and Wade is still alive

00:05:57.808 --> 00:06:01.008
Red Cap digs the wax off Wade's face with her bare hands

00:06:01.136 --> 00:06:03.824
Wade is not able to open his mouth and speak

00:06:03.952 --> 00:06:07.088
his wide open eyes just tell the great pain he suffers

00:06:07.472 --> 00:06:10.032
the disfigured man shows up out of nowhere

00:06:10.096 --> 00:06:12.336
and cuts off the head of Mr. Red Cap with scissors

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.152
making him Mr. Red Head immediately

00:06:15.408 --> 00:06:17.392
back to the camp, unexpectedly

00:06:17.456 --> 00:06:22.192
Blonde and Hormone Long enjoy the longest hormone game the first time of their whole life

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:25.904
knowing nothing about the bloody scenes happening to their friends

00:06:26.736 --> 00:06:32.048
later Hormone Long switches his phone on, and calls back to the unanswered call from Carly

00:06:32.112 --> 00:06:36.336
but it is too late, the disfigured man approaches him from the back

00:06:36.464 --> 00:06:37.936
and kills him with a cut in the throat

00:06:38.064 --> 00:06:41.776
making Mr. Long appear the shortest in the show among the six friends

00:06:41.968 --> 00:06:44.848
despite his being longest in the hormone game

00:06:45.232 --> 00:06:47.728
Blonde flees without putting her dress on 

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:52.400
but the disfigured man catches up, and killed her with a stick hitting on the head

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:56.368
then, the disfigured man pulls the bodies of this couple into his car

00:06:56.496 --> 00:06:58.416
and drives to Greasy's home

00:06:59.184 --> 00:07:01.936
Carly and Half Bald also head toward Greasy's

00:07:02.128 --> 00:07:04.560
hoping to find a telephone to call the police

00:07:04.688 --> 00:07:07.632
Half Bald carries with him a crossbow for defense

00:07:08.144 --> 00:07:11.408
Greasy discovers them and fires with the shotgun

00:07:11.792 --> 00:07:16.080
Half Bald shoots two arrows at him, causing him to fall to the ground

00:07:16.528 --> 00:07:21.008
believing that he is dead, the brother and sister take his gun and enter the house

00:07:21.136 --> 00:07:22.992
and find the bodies of their friends

00:07:23.376 --> 00:07:26.576
Carly finds a pile of old newspapers on the table

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:29.584
on one page, Carly reads a piece of news

00:07:29.712 --> 00:07:32.656
it was about the twin babies, born conjoined

00:07:32.656 --> 00:07:36.250
their father was a doctor and he himself separated the twins 

00:07:36.369 --> 00:07:39.441
who are exactly Greasy and the disfigured man

00:07:39.569 --> 00:07:45.009
elder disfigured man teaches younger Greasy how to make wax figures using living humans

00:07:45.713 --> 00:07:47.377
while she is reading the news

00:07:47.441 --> 00:07:52.177
Greasy returns home with arrows in his body, and the disfigured man also comes back

00:07:52.433 --> 00:07:55.057
the brutal twin brothers discuss how to kill them

00:07:55.121 --> 00:07:57.873
so Carly and Half Bald have to part from each other

00:07:58.001 --> 00:08:00.561
and plan to meet later down at the basement  

00:08:00.945 --> 00:08:04.721
Half Bald gropes in the dark trying to switch on the basement light 

00:08:04.913 --> 00:08:08.433
however, he slips his finger and turns on all the lights

00:08:09.009 --> 00:08:12.593
Half Bald finds Red Cap who has been made into a wax figure

00:08:12.721 --> 00:08:14.321
and tries to rescue him

00:08:14.833 --> 00:08:16.817
when the disfigured man rushes in

00:08:16.945 --> 00:08:20.977
Half Bald pours out the flaming wax and sets the basement on fire

00:08:21.233 --> 00:08:23.537
Carly and Half Bald then run away

00:08:23.857 --> 00:08:27.569
Greasy stops their way, he cuts Half Bald's thigh with a machete

00:08:27.697 --> 00:08:29.809
but unfortunately misses his balls

00:08:29.937 --> 00:08:32.689
Half Bald falls to the ground because of that 

00:08:33.231 --> 00:08:37.391
flames quickly spread when they fight, and the whole house is on fire

00:08:37.711 --> 00:08:41.935
in the chaos, Carly clubs Greasy to death on the head with a baseball bat

00:08:42.063 --> 00:08:45.455
the disfigured man comes and finds his twin brother dead

00:08:45.775 --> 00:08:48.655
he holds him and wails, vowing for revenge

00:08:49.231 --> 00:08:53.455
Carly runs upstairs, trying to close herself inside the bedroom

00:08:53.583 --> 00:08:56.399
but she forgets that the house is made of wax

00:08:56.527 --> 00:08:59.343
when the disfigured man breaks the wall and comes in

00:08:59.471 --> 00:09:03.951
Half Bald collects himself up and rushes into the bedroom to protect his sister

00:09:04.079 --> 00:09:06.767
the sister and brother fight shoulder by shoulder

00:09:06.895 --> 00:09:09.775
and they kill the disfigured monster in a joint effort

00:09:10.415 --> 00:09:13.551
now the House of Wax is melting and about to collapse

00:09:13.679 --> 00:09:17.007
the two dig a hole in the wall, and escape successfully

00:09:17.391 --> 00:09:21.039
soon after they run away, the House of Wax is burned down

00:09:21.615 --> 00:09:23.279
the next morning come the police 

00:09:23.407 --> 00:09:26.479
and Carly and Half Bald think the nightmare is over

00:09:26.671 --> 00:09:31.343
a policeman however, tells them that the parents in Ambrose Town had one more son

00:09:31.471 --> 00:09:35.951
and their third son is the green-hatted guy who rode them to the town previously

00:09:36.527 --> 00:09:39.599
frightened, Carly and Half Bald get on the police car 

00:09:39.855 --> 00:09:42.735
and escape the god-damned place as soon as possible

00:09:42.927 --> 00:09:45.295
while on seeing them leave in the far distance

00:09:45.359 --> 00:09:48.431
the green-hatted guy wears a strange smile

00:09:49.199 --> 00:09:52.207
