Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.889 --> 00:00:07.020
Today, I'm going to show you a fantasy romantic
drama film titled The Curious Case of Benjamin

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.020
Button.

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:09.310
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:11.210
Watch out and take care!

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:15.550
An old woman lies vulnerably in a hospital
bed while Hurricane Katrina hits New Orleans.

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:19.910
A younger woman crosses the space in between
them and desperately tries to console the

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:21.150
old woman.

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.160
The old woman was ready and waiting to cease.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.710
A short recollection of a familiar story swiftly
appears before her consciousness.

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:33.269
A visually impaired watchmaker in New Orleans
has a son who has been deployed on the battlefield.

00:00:33.269 --> 00:00:37.620
When his son left, all he did was work on
the town's most prominent watch.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.829
After four short months, a letter arrived
proclaiming their son died in the war.

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:46.190
The watchmaker mourned so much that he decided
to reverse-engineer the town's watch to commemorate

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.280
all the lives lost in the war.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.680
He wished that he could turn back the time
to keep their children alive, and their sons

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.510
would come back home one day.

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.920
The whole town remembered the clock as the
watchmaker's parting gift as he was never

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.510
seen again.

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.969
The old woman, Daisy, asks the younger woman
Karoline to pick up a book from her suitcase.

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:06.750
She asks her to open the book and read through
the pages.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.970
Karoline sees several memorabilia attached
to the diary.

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.580
Karoline reads a last will and testament.

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.660
The testament leaves no possessions of wealth
but revelations to Karoline as far as a man

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.100
names Benjamin can remember.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.340
When the war was announced to have ended,
the families of the dead soldiers mourned.

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.740
But the war is a two-faced traitor being celebrated
by the rest of the people in New Orleans.

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.850
A man sprints nervously in the middle of the
rejoicing crowd towards his house.

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.730
He comes home to her dying wife after giving
birth.

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:38.660
The ill woman asks him to promise her to show
love and affection to her child before she

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.520
bids him farewell.

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.220
Thomas steps towards the crib, leans over
the crying little creature, almost vomiting

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.370
on sight.

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.160
He jerkily carries him and runs the house
outwards.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.150
He takes him to drown alive in the lake just
a mile away from home, but a guard shouts

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:53.930
over and runs after him.

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.470
The guard loses sight of Thomas as he hides
in a short alley.

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.910
He inserts a piece of cloth into the child's
swaddle and leaves him in the stairs of a

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:03.190
well-lit house just behind the alley.

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.720
A couple is sweetly talking outside the house,
but an old lady interrupts their moment.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.900
The woman follows the old lady back inside
the house, but the man drags her and mindlessly

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.180
takes small steps down the stairs.

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.170
The man could have crashed the tiny, swaddled
boy in the stairs if he has not immediately

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.040
lifted his foot and skipped.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.450
The woman opens up the swaddle, revealing
the oddest baby the two have ever seen.

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.630
The couple gasps in horror and amusement.

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.250
The man persuades her to leave the baby alone,
but the woman picks him up and carries him

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.810
inside the house.

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.940
She keeps him in her drawers in her room and
assists the aged people in the shelter.

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.790
She comes in contact with the doctor, who
she calls along to her room.

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:45.740
The doctor diagnoses that the boy was blind
from cataracts, deaf, has ossified hands and

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.540
feet and is also suffering from Arthritis.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.430
The doctor declares that he was not a newborn
but an old man deteriorating to the grave.

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.090
Queenie feels necessarily pitiful that she
wants to keep him, but the doctor warns her

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.940
that not everyone is meant to survive.

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.440
Queenie carefully takes the baby to the shelter
where the aged people gather and names the

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.350
little boy Benjamin.

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.660
Benjamin finds a home as Queenie raises him
in the shelter.

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:13.090
Growing up, Benjamin lived the first few years
of his life thinking he was also in his twilight

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.690
years, just like the people in the shelter.

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.660
He was the playful old man who can only move
his limbs with a wheelchair.

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.860
Queenie stands by him as he aged into youth.

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.580
One night, Queenie takes Benjamin to a faith
healer.

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:29.560
She asks to be prayed over to start bearing
a child and clear Benjamin from what she called

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:30.959
"The Devil's Curse".

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:35.080
The healer asks him to rise from his wheelchair,
but Benjamin falls down.

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.080
He manages to rise again and takes little
steps.

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.450
The healer collapses and dies in rejoice at
Benjamin's victory that night.

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.819
The shelter has regular visits from birthdays
and deaths, and Benjamin witnesses how people

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:51.030
come and go, leaving him wondering why death
hasn't taken him yet.

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.110
Benjamin becomes acquainted with a pygmy man
who takes him to train trips and parks.

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:59.110
The pygmy man leaves him alone in crutches,
where Benjamin spends the whole night walking

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:00.810
himself home.

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.630
Benjamin thought it was one of the best days
of his life.

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:08.040
On Sundays, the families of the aged people
visit the shelter for thanksgiving.

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.849
One of the elderly women introduces Benjamin
to her granddaughter, Daisy, an adorable auburn

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:14.440
girl with blue eyes.

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.079
He falls in love the moment she met Daisy.

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:21.590
After serving the thanksgiving lunch, Queenie
announces that she is going to have a baby.

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.909
While Benjamin is dealing with the news, Daisy
starts opening up and playing to Benjamin.

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:30.259
One night, the two light up a candle under
a bed down the basement and reveal secrets

00:04:30.259 --> 00:04:31.830
to each other.

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.370
Benjamin admits that he was not as old as
he looked, and Daisy believes he was different

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:36.370
from the others.

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.020
Daisy's grandmother catches and scolds the
two of them for misbehaving.

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:44.160
When Daisy left, Benjamin gets back to getting
acquainted with older people.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.629
One lady teaches him how to play the piano.

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:51.530
As time goes by, Benjamin notices more changes
taking place in his body.

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:55.969
One day, he visits a port with another old
man and is hired to work in the boat.

00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:58.219
The work in the sea excites the odd Benjamin.

00:04:58.219 --> 00:05:02.779
He grows close to Captain Mike, who eventually
discovers that he was still a virgin.

00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:06.590
Captain Mike takes Benjamin to a brothel where
they have a dose of liquors, sentiments and

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:07.699
women.

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:12.199
Despite Benjamin's odd and peculiar appearance,
a prostitute eagerly takes him but becomes

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:16.090
flabbergasted when Benjamin does not run out
of sexual vigour.

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:17.949
He became her sole guest.

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:22.029
While going home from the brothel, a car stops
by Benjamin on the sidewalk.

00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:26.099
He invites Benjamin to the car and introduces
himself as Thomas Button.

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:30.059
The two heads to a luxurious bar and talks
about Benjamin's disease.

00:05:30.059 --> 00:05:33.960
Later that night, Thomas takes him home and
asks him if he could pay a visit time after

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:35.389
time.

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:39.910
Daisy comes by another thanksgiving day and
spends the day with Daisy in the tugboat.

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:43.270
Captain Mike revs the boat to life as Benjamin
wishes.

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:45.229
Benjamin's old lady friend dies one day.

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:49.460
There, he comes to an epiphany that his life
passes by differently than anyone else in

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:50.620
the shelter.

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:54.750
He lovingly bids farewell to her parents and
the shelter, who wish him safety and happiness

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:56.180
in turn.

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:00.159
Benjamin promises to write Daisy a postcard
from wherever he lands.

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:03.930
His life in the sea was long and agonizing,
but Daisy makes sure to send a letter back

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:05.839
after every postcard.

00:06:05.839 --> 00:06:09.729
Meanwhile, Daisy advances to be a professional
ballet dancer.

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:13.509
Benjamin and his crew stop by brothels and
bars whenever they dock on land.

00:06:13.509 --> 00:06:18.490
On one trip, Benjamin pays for a hotel room
where he meets Elizabeth and her husband Walter,

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:20.369
who happens to be a spy.

00:06:20.369 --> 00:06:24.150
One night when he had trouble dozing off,
he gets acquainted with Elizabeth.

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:28.220
They find solace with each other countless
nights, meeting at the hotel lobby every night

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:31.819
when he couldn't sleep and when she doesn't
have her husband around her.

00:06:31.819 --> 00:06:34.860
Benjamin falls in love with the married Elizabeth.

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:37.250
Benjamin admits the unfortunate news to Daisy.

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:42.729
Even though Daisy is making significant progress
with her career, the news broke her heart.

00:06:42.729 --> 00:06:46.159
Benjamin spends many nights with Elizabeth,
where he consciencelessly ends up making love

00:06:46.159 --> 00:06:47.159
to her.

00:06:47.159 --> 00:06:51.220
Their affair is too good to be true until
one night, Elizabeth no longer meets him in

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:53.610
the lobby of their own little world.

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:57.009
Benjamin learns to deal with losing Elizabeth
when the war starts to break out back in the

00:06:57.009 --> 00:06:58.009
sea.

00:06:58.009 --> 00:07:01.919
The crew is preparing for salvage, but their
tugboat has been caught in between the military

00:07:01.919 --> 00:07:03.099
distress.

00:07:03.099 --> 00:07:07.960
The opponents kill their captain and some
of the crew, and the tugboat crashes in despair.

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:12.210
Benjamin is, fortunately, alive and bids goodbye
to the friendships who died along with the

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:13.889
tugboat.

00:07:13.889 --> 00:07:17.879
Benjamin comes back home to the shelter where
she sees to happy, old Queenie.

00:07:17.879 --> 00:07:21.530
Despite the sorrow on the sea and the death
in the shelter, both of them are immensely

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:24.280
grateful and apologetic at the same time.

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:27.060
One lonely morning, Daisy visits the shelter.

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:31.149
Daisy hugs Benjamin, but Benjamin dwells that
Daisy was just a girl when he left, but a

00:07:31.149 --> 00:07:34.449
beautiful woman had taken her place when he
came back.

00:07:34.449 --> 00:07:38.449
Daisy and Benjamin head out for a night to
reconnect, and Benjamin finds himself falling

00:07:38.449 --> 00:07:43.520
in love with a gracefully dancing Daisy, who
kisses and seduces him before the night ends.

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:47.179
She goes home disappointed as Benjamin adamantly
rejects him.

00:07:47.179 --> 00:07:51.330
The following night, an old friend Thomas
passes by the shelter and takes Benjamin for

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:54.860
a dinner where he admits his affection for
Benjamin as a company.

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:59.360
He takes Benjamin to the button factory, where
he reveals that Benjamin is his son.

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:04.749
He tours her around his house and introduces
an old picture of Benjamin's mother, Karoline.

00:08:04.749 --> 00:08:07.129
Benjamin leaves Thomas' house confused and
pained.

00:08:07.129 --> 00:08:10.999
Later, he comes back to the Button's mansion
and picks him up for an early trip to the

00:08:10.999 --> 00:08:14.139
lake, where Thomas lets go of his life.

00:08:14.139 --> 00:08:16.460
Benjamin heads to New York for Daisy's show.

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:20.050
He once again falls in love with the graceful
Daisy onstage.

00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:22.969
After the show, he pays her a backstage visit.

00:08:22.969 --> 00:08:26.879
Benjamin becomes jealous and leaves the afterparty
when a friend kisses Daisy squarely on the

00:08:26.879 --> 00:08:27.879
lips.

00:08:27.879 --> 00:08:31.759
She chases after her but ends up leaving too
after hearing that Benjamin felt happy for

00:08:31.759 --> 00:08:33.690
her boyfriend.

00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:38.080
Benjamin spends his days touring with his
motorcycle and repairing things in the shelter.

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:42.260
One day, he receives a sad letter and heads
to a hospital in Paris.

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:46.820
Daisy is suffering from multiple injuries
after being hit by a taxi days ago.

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:50.670
Benjamin wants to take her home, but Daisy
asks him to stay out of his life.

00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:55.040
The broken Benjamin dealt with the agony through
countless one-night stands.

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:58.870
Daisy reconnects with Benjamin one day where
they end up making love that night.

00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:03.650
The two spend their years passionately making
love at different places in different weather.

00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:07.829
Eventually, Benjamin's disease starts complicating
their relationships.

00:09:07.829 --> 00:09:12.029
Daisy worries that Benjamin will wake up to
an old lady one day, but she shrugs it off,

00:09:12.029 --> 00:09:13.959
knowing he loved him enough.

00:09:13.959 --> 00:09:18.540
The news of Queenie's death break Benjamin
and Daisy but moves on after time.

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:26.230
Benjamin sells his father's mansion to live
his years with Daisy in their own duplex.

00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:30.339
The loss of youth cause Daisy great pain,
but she promises Benjamin to accept ageing

00:09:30.339 --> 00:09:31.750
as it is.

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:36.550
Daisy opens up her own ballet class and reveals
that she is carrying Benjamin's child.

00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:40.170
Benjamin grows excessively worried that the
baby might end up like him or he might not

00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:42.550
be able to father the baby at all.

00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:46.170
Daisy eases him off by promising that she
will make things work for their family.

00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:51.360
9 months later, Daisy triumphantly gives birth
to their first child and names the child after

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:53.100
his mother, Karoline.

00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:58.000
Karoline becomes angry after the diary's revelation
but continued reading through the pages.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.649
The gravity of Benjamin's disease started
to show when he realized that their child

00:10:01.649 --> 00:10:03.740
needs a father and not a playmate.

00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:07.709
Even though he loved his wife and daughter,
he decides to leave them with all his inheritances

00:10:07.709 --> 00:10:10.510
to live in the direction his disease is taking
him.

00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:14.750
Karoline reads all the notes of regrets in
the postcards her father has sent throughout

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:17.339
her life.

00:10:17.339 --> 00:10:21.500
Benjamin spent the rest of his life in vain
in different places.

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:25.920
One day, the teen-looking Benjamin decides
to see Karoline and Daisy, but he discovers

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:28.940
that she remarried the man who fathered Karoline.

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:32.949
Daisy and Benjamin spent their last passionate
night together at a hotel.

00:10:32.949 --> 00:10:35.470
The years went through without seeing each
other.

00:10:35.470 --> 00:10:42.800
But a man called Daisy to hand out his diary.

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:47.930
In his early years, Benjamin is playing a
familiar tune on the piano, suffering from

00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:48.990
dementia.

00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:52.860
The old Daisy takes care of the demented young
Benjamin until the government of Louisiana

00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:54.810
replaced the town's watch.

00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:58.790
Oddly enough, his forgetful and agonizing
years came to an end.

00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:02.399
The hurricane completely broke out of New
Orleans when Karoline finished reading the

00:11:02.399 --> 00:11:03.560
diary.

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:13.589
When the city was flooded, the story of Benjamin
and the reverse-engineered watch have ended.
