00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.080
Story Recapped here. Today I'm going to&nbsp;
explain a British post-apocalyptic zombie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.560
film called 28 Days Later. Spoilers&nbsp;
ahead! Watch out and take care.

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.320
At the Cambridge Primate Research Centre, a&nbsp;
chimpanzee is strapped to a bed with electrodes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.920
on its head. An array of television screens&nbsp;
play videos of riots in front of the animal.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.360
A group of animal rights activists&nbsp;
infiltrates the facility. A room full&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.520
of chimpanzees in cages angers the group,&nbsp;
horrified at the animals' conditions. They&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.720
start taking photographs as evidence of&nbsp;
animal cruelty against the research center.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.960
They go further into the room, finding&nbsp;
the chimpanzee watching the riot footage.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.800
The woman in the group is troubled by the scene,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.520
but their leader pushes her to focus&nbsp;
on their task to save the animals.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.080
A scientist for the research center walks&nbsp;
in on them. He rushes to alert security,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.520
but one of the male activists catches&nbsp;
and stops him. The scientist warns them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.440
that the chimpanzees are infected and that their&nbsp;
experiments could develop a cure for the animals.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.600
When the leader interrogates&nbsp;
him about the infection,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.920
the scientist simply explains&nbsp;
that they're infected with rage.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.400
This doesn't convince the activist. The&nbsp;
leader orders the others to free the animals,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.600
despite the scientist warning them that&nbsp;
they're highly contagious. The female&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.880
activist opens a cage and is immediately&nbsp;
attacked by the chimpanzee inside.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.920
It bites her until the other man hits&nbsp;
the animal's head to force it to let go.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.880
The woman starts vomiting blood. The&nbsp;
frightened scientist begs them to kill her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.080
but the others don't listen. The woman&nbsp;
spits blood onto her fellow activist's face,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.640
causing him to recoil. The scientist grabs a metal&nbsp;
chair, ready to kill the infected woman. But he's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.240
too late. The infection has set in, and the woman&nbsp;
attacks him while the monkeys bang on the cage.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.240
Twenty-eight days later, a bicycle courier&nbsp;
named Jim wakes up alone in the hospital.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.160
He's strapped to various tubes and surrounded&nbsp;
by medical machinery. But there is no one else&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.320
in the room and no signs of life in the hospital&nbsp;
hall. He finds a key under the door and opens it.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.720
After finding a set of scrubs, he clothes&nbsp;
himself and wanders around the hospital.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.400
The building is in disarray, and all&nbsp;
the phones are down. Jim gathers drinks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.440
and candy bars from the broken vending&nbsp;
machines before setting off into the city.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.840
The city is quiet and desolated. Signs of chaos&nbsp;
are everywhere, filling the Westminster bridge&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.400
with trash. Jim calls out for anyone as he&nbsp;
wanders around London, but nobody answers.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.640
Having no idea what happened, he pushes on, hoping&nbsp;
to find any clue as to why the city is empty.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.400
While gathering for supplies, he picks&nbsp;
up a newspaper with the word EVACUATION&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.520
on the front page -- it's his first&nbsp;
clue about the situation. Soon after,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.280
he finds a wall filled with missing person&nbsp;
posters and letters from concerned families.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.960
Desperate for answers, Jim walks into a dim&nbsp;
church, heading up the steps for a better view&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.120
of the area. He stops when he sees the countless&nbsp;
dead bodies littered on the bottom floor.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.920
The horrific image has Jim&nbsp;
frozen, confused and devastated.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.480
He calls out, hoping that there's still someone&nbsp;
alive. Immediately, some of the bodies stand,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.240
looking at him menacingly. He hears&nbsp;
banging on the door across the hallway.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.760
A priest forces the doors open,&nbsp;
screeching and twitching violently.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.840
Jim slowly backs away, fearful of the crazed&nbsp;
man before him. The priest charges at him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.680
attempting to grab him, and Jim swings his bag&nbsp;
of supplies across his head, causing the priest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.760
to tumble down. Jim cries, regretting his action.&nbsp;
But the priest continues to clamber towards him.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.720
Jim heads down the stairs and out of the&nbsp;
church. A few of the raging people chase&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.480
after him. When he nears the gas station,&nbsp;
two people throw petrol bombs at his chasers,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.240
helping him escape. They drag him out of the&nbsp;
scene just before the gas station explodes.

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:57.040
Once the explosion settles, they take him to&nbsp;
the subway station. Jim collapses inside the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.240
convenience store as the survivors,&nbsp;
Mark and Selena, interrogate them.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.600
Jim tells them that the last thing&nbsp;
he remembers is that he was in a car&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.800
accident while on the job before he woke&nbsp;
up in the empty hospital earlier that day.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.280
Mark and Selena recount what happened to the&nbsp;
city. It started as riots in small villages.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.280
Then it reached the city. The people finally&nbsp;
figured that it was not riots but an infection&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.040
spreading through blood contact, causing the&nbsp;
infected to attack others. The government tried&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.280
to evacuate the cities, but the plague was already&nbsp;
everywhere. The last news they heard is that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.200
infection is spreading even in Paris and New&nbsp;
York City. The government and army have fallen.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Jim refuses to believe that there are no other&nbsp;
survivors except for them. He decides that he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.920
needs to check on his family. Mark suggests that&nbsp;
they all go tomorrow morning when it's safer.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.720
The next day, they walk to Deptford, where&nbsp;
Jim's parents live. But when they arrive,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.120
Jim finds that his parents have committed suicide&nbsp;
in their bed, holding a picture of him as a child.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.320
At the back of the photograph is a note&nbsp;
from Jim's parents. They believed that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.200
he already died sleeping in the hospital&nbsp;
and that they'll join him in the afterlife.

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.760
Jim mourns for his parents. Selena tells him&nbsp;
that at least they died peacefully instead of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:00.560
being attacked by the infected. But Jim refuses to&nbsp;
take comfort in that thought. Mark tells his story&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.640
of how his parents and sister tried to escape by&nbsp;
leaving the country. But when the infected came,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.560
he lost track of his family in the chaos. In the&nbsp;
end, he only saw his dad getting attacked. Mark&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.000
agrees with Selena -- Jim should be grateful&nbsp;
that his parents didn't die on their terms.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.960
They decide to stay at the house for the&nbsp;
night. While Selena and Mark are asleep,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:18.960
Jim looks around the house, reminiscing about his&nbsp;
parents. He watches a home video of his parents,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:21.040
but the lights alert the infected outside.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:25.200
The infected crash into the windows, cornering&nbsp;
Jim. Marks comes and kills the infected.

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.960
Jim recognizes his attackers as their&nbsp;
neighbors. Selena quickly interrogates&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.560
Jim if he was bit or if the infected blood got&nbsp;
into his mouth. He says no. They turn to Mark,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.840
who's cleaning a wound on his arm. As&nbsp;
soon as he noticed Selena looking at him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.440
he's scared and pleading for his life.&nbsp;
Without another word, Selena kills him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.080
Jim watches in horror but&nbsp;
doesn't question Selena's action.

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.760
Right after Mark's death, Selena starts&nbsp;
gathering supplies and tells Jim to do the same.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.840
More infected tend to arrive after an attack,&nbsp;
so they can't stay in the house anymore.

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.080
As they walk in the dark empty streets,&nbsp;
Jim finally asks how Selena knew Mark was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.960
infected. Selena said that she didn't&nbsp;
know, but she could tell from how Mark&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.000
looked. That he knew he was infected.&nbsp;
Selena insists that once infected,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.120
they only have 10-20 seconds to&nbsp;
kill the person before they turn.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.720
She assures him that if Jim gets infected,&nbsp;
Selena will do the same as she did with Mark.

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.200
Blinking lights from an apartment building catches&nbsp;
Jim's attention. They head to the building to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:15.520
investigate. From the building's ground floor,&nbsp;
they see the stairs barricaded by shopping carts.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:20.160
They climb the stairs, but Jim stops, feeling&nbsp;
unwell. Selena explains that he's crashing,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.680
having eaten nothing but candy bars and&nbsp;
soda. She gives him pain medication,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.400
but they hear the infected rushing to&nbsp;
the building before Jim can drink it.

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:31.840
The infected reach the stairs and chases after&nbsp;
them. Jim struggles to climb, still feeling weak.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:36.080
He pleads for Selena to help him. He finally&nbsp;
catches up to her just as Selena is stopped by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.920
a man in riot gear. The man tells them to go to&nbsp;
one of the apartments while he fights against&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:44.000
the infected. However, the girl inside refuses&nbsp;
to let them in until her father tells her so.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.480
Inside, they meet father and&nbsp;
daughter, Frank and Hannah.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.040
Frank is ecstatic to find new&nbsp;
survivors, but Hannah is wary of them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.240
Frank offers them drinks before shutting off&nbsp;
the Christmas lights he set up on the window.

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:59.120
That evening, Selena and Jim talk about Frank&nbsp;
and Hannah. Selena believes that Frank and Hannah&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:02.720
needed them; that's why they saved them. Jim&nbsp;
thinks they're just good people. Selena chuckles,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:06.240
saying that they're more likely to slow them&nbsp;
down, and she would leave them if that was so.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:09.120
Before turning in to sleep, Jim&nbsp;
finally thanks Selena for saving him.

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:13.680
The following day, Frank takes Jim to the rooftop,&nbsp;
where he had set all the pails and basins he could&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:17.440
find to gather water. But it hasn't rained in&nbsp;
10 days, leaving all the buckets dry and empty.

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:22.000
The four listen to the radio, hearing a broadcast&nbsp;
from the military that promises salvation in a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.840
blockade outside of Manchester. Frank plans&nbsp;
for them to head there, confessing that he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:29.120
did need them more than they needed his help.&nbsp;
He couldn't risk his daughter helpless in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:33.200
streets if something happened to him. But Selena&nbsp;
argues that if the broadcast is a recording,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:37.200
the soldiers may already be dead. Hannah finally&nbsp;
speaks up, pointing out that they'll die where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:40.720
they are anyway as they were running out of&nbsp;
supplies. They can't protect themselves from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:44.400
the infected in the city either, so they have to&nbsp;
try finding the military for better protection.

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:48.560
The next day, they take Frank's cab to&nbsp;
head to their destination. They watch the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:51.840
devastation in the city from the car window.&nbsp;
Countless dead bodies are on the street.

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:55.520
They stop in front of a tunnel,&nbsp;
weighing the risks of driving inside.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:58.880
The tunnel is the most direct way to their&nbsp;
destination, but Jim argues that it's safer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:03.040
to take a longer path in broad daylight. Frank&nbsp;
decides to just go into the tunnel to save time.

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:06.960
Inside the tunnel, abandoned cars&nbsp;
block their way. Frank takes the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:11.520
risk and drives around and over the cars. It&nbsp;
works, but a tire gets flattened on the way.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:14.720
Hannah hurries to change the tire while&nbsp;
Selena and Jim watch out for the infected.

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:19.200
Jim hears something strange in the distance.&nbsp;
A large group of rats rushes past them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:24.400
Selena realizes that the rats are running away&nbsp;
from the infected, who have reached the tunnel.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:28.640
Frank and Jim lift the car to help Hannah change&nbsp;
the tires. The tire is fixed in the nick of time,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:32.080
and they all rush inside. Frank drives&nbsp;
away before the infected reach them.

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:37.200
They stop by a grocery store, taking one shopping&nbsp;
cart to fill for each of them. The small shopping&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:40.880
spree lightens up the group's mood. They load&nbsp;
up the car with the supplies and drive away.

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:44.960
They stop again to retrieve gas from a&nbsp;
fuel truck near a cheeseburger store.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:48.800
While Frank gathers fuel, Jim enters&nbsp;
the store, hoping to find cheeseburgers.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:52.080
Instead, he finds dead bodies&nbsp;
inside. When he calls out,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:55.120
he's attacked by an infected child,&nbsp;
whom he kills using a baseball bat.

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:58.240
The group moves on to an old castle&nbsp;
ruin, where they have a picnic.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:02.240
Frank points out to a family of horses running&nbsp;
free. The group enjoys the peaceful view.

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:06.000
After bonding with the rest, Selena confesses&nbsp;
that she's changed her mind on only caring about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.840
her own survival. Feeling happy for the first&nbsp;
time since the outbreak, Selena kisses Jim on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:14.000
the cheek but apologizes immediately. Jim is&nbsp;
nonchalant about it but looks glad about the kiss.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.720
They decide to camp out in the ruin for the night.&nbsp;
Jim, Frank, and Hannah can't sleep, worried if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:23.440
they were safe enough out there. They notice that&nbsp;
Selena was sound asleep. Jim wakes her up, asking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:27.840
how she manages to sleep. Selena reveals that she&nbsp;
has prescription medicines in her bag. Selena was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:31.600
a chemist before the outbreak. That's how she got&nbsp;
the medication. Jim offers Frank and Hannah Valium&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:36.080
from Selena's stash to help them sleep. Frank&nbsp;
refuses, wanting to be alert in case of an attack.

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:40.560
After falling asleep, Jim wakes up with&nbsp;
the others gone. He panics and screams,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:44.720
with no one answering him. Frank wakes him&nbsp;
up. Jim realizes it was just a nightmare.

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:48.240
On the next day, they finally reach the&nbsp;
blockade and find that it's in ruins.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:52.080
They investigate the area, hoping for any&nbsp;
signs of life. The others have given up,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:55.120
but Frank insists on looking for clues&nbsp;
about where the military has gone.

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:59.040
Frank walks around the blockade, separating&nbsp;
himself from the rest. A crow eating an infected&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:02.560
soldier distracts him. He starts lashing out&nbsp;
at the crow out of frustration but ends up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:06.160
getting infected blood into his eye. Hannah&nbsp;
finds him. He reminds her that he loves her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:09.840
alerting Hannah that something was wrong. Frank&nbsp;
becomes violent, pushing Hannah away to keep her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:13.680
safe from himself. Jim and Selena rush to Hannah's&nbsp;
aid, watching Frank turn from the infection.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:17.600
Selena holds back Hannah as she screams for Jim&nbsp;
to kill Frank. Just as Jim is about to fight him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:20.480
soldiers hiding in the woods start&nbsp;
shooting at Frank, killing him quickly.

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:24.720
The soldiers take Jim, Hannah, and Selena&nbsp;
to their new base at the Worsley House.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:28.320
There, they meet the leader, Major&nbsp;
Henry West, who welcomes them.

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:32.080
While Hannah is resting, Selena breaks down,&nbsp;
worried about Hannah. She didn't want Hannah to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:35.840
go through this life they're in. Seeing compassion&nbsp;
in her, Jim kisses her, surprising Selena.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:40.000
She kisses him back but quickly rushes out&nbsp;
of the room, confused about her feelings.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.320
Later that day, Jim talks to Major West. Major&nbsp;
West talks about their answer to the infection,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:47.840
which may not be what Jim's group imagined. He&nbsp;
gives Jim a tour of the mansion, explaining how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:51.360
they've secured the area and built a civilized&nbsp;
living despite the conditions. In the kitchen,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:54.000
Jim meets Private Jones, who's taken&nbsp;
up cooking duties for the team.

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:59.360
Finally, Major West takes Jim behind the mansion&nbsp;
where Mailer, an infected soldier, is chained up.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:02.480
Major West explains that he'd done this&nbsp;
to learn about the infected, at least,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:05.920
to find out how long it takes for Mailer and&nbsp;
the rest of the infected to die of starvation.

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:08.400
That evening, the trio has&nbsp;
dinner with the soldiers.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:17.840
They meet the rest of the team, Davis, Bell,&nbsp;
Farrell, Clifton, Bedford, and Mitchell,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:22.800
who talks about what it means to go back to&nbsp;
a normal life. Major West raises that people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:26.560
have always killed other people, even before the&nbsp;
outbreak. So they're still living normal lives.

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:30.400
An explosion alerts the soldiers, and they&nbsp;
rush to fight the incoming infected people.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:33.680
The infected are running to the mansion from&nbsp;
the clearing, and soldiers shoot at them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:38.160
When Jones successfully kills one, he cheers&nbsp;
triumphantly, but Mitchell scolds him to focus.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:42.080
An infected triggers a mine that explodes, ending&nbsp;
the fight. The soldiers celebrate their victory.

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:45.440
Seeing Selena with her machete,&nbsp;
Mitchell takes the weapon from her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:49.120
assuring her that he will protect her. He&nbsp;
mocks her and attempts to force himself on her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:55.040
but Jim stops him. Mitchell gets the upper hand&nbsp;
on Jim, but Farrell slams Mitchell with his gun.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:59.200
Major West stops the commotion, ordering Mitchell&nbsp;
to secure the area, and orders Farrell to clear&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:03.040
the bodies. He returns the machete back&nbsp;
to Selena before inviting Jim for a drink.

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:07.360
Alone, Major West confesses that, after&nbsp;
he caught Jones trying to kill himself,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:10.320
he promised the team that he would give them&nbsp;
any women they rescued. This was why he sent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:13.680
out the radio broadcast, to lure survivors,&nbsp;
hoping that there will be women whom the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:17.200
soldiers can repopulate the world with once&nbsp;
all the infected die of starvation. To him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:19.120
it was the only way to give&nbsp;
his team hope for the future.

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:23.280
Horrified, Jim storms out of the&nbsp;
room to fetch Selena and Hannah.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:27.360
He rushes them to escape but is knocked out by the&nbsp;
soldiers. When Jim wakes up, Farrell is protecting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:32.000
him from the others. But he's overpowered and&nbsp;
subdued. Major West gives Jim a chance to join his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.080
team, insisting that they needed the women. Jim&nbsp;
refuses and is locked in the cellar with Farrell.

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:40.800
In the cellar, Jim listens to Farrell&nbsp;
ranting about how Major West had gone insane.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:44.240
Farrell insists that Great Britain is only being&nbsp;
quarantined, and the rest of the world is free&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:48.560
from the infection. Mitchell and Jones arrive and&nbsp;
take the two prisoners in the woods for execution.

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:53.600
Jim and Farrell are taken to the place where they&nbsp;
dispose of dead bodies. Farrell insults Mitchell,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:57.600
causing tension between them. Mitchell threatens&nbsp;
that he'll kill them painfully, but the nervous&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:01.920
Jones fires at Farrell instead, sparing him from&nbsp;
Mitchell's sadism. Jones nearly hits Mitchell,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:05.600
angering him. The distraction allows Jim to&nbsp;
hide. Mitchell and Jones run to find Jim,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:07.760
not knowing that Jim hid&nbsp;
amongst the dead bodies nearby.

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:12.320
He listens to Jones and Mitchell yell and&nbsp;
fire aimlessly, desperate to find him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:16.000
Jim climbs over the wall and escapes.&nbsp;
Seeing his shirt stuck on the barbed wires,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.920
Mitchell is confident that&nbsp;
he'll be dead soon anyway.

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:21.200
A storm brews as Jim runs in the woods. Tired,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:24.800
he collapses again and spots an airplane&nbsp;
in the sky. The sight gives him hope.

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:27.840
Back at the Worsley House, Selena hugs&nbsp;
Hannah protectively while Major West&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:31.680
commands Bedford to take them to the master's&nbsp;
bedroom and make them look more presentable.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:34.560
There, they force Selena's&nbsp;
clothes off. Getting an idea,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:37.840
Selena kisses Clifton and convinces him to&nbsp;
let her and Hannah dress up by themselves.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:41.760
The soldiers agree to leave, believing that&nbsp;
the women won't do anything on their own.

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:43.600
Once they're alone, Selena hurriedly gives Hannah&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:46.640
sleeping pills to make what awaits them&nbsp;
less traumatic for the younger girl.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:49.760
However, they're caught by Clifton,&nbsp;
who forcibly takes the pills from them.

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:54.720
A warning siren sounds coming from their&nbsp;
old blockade. Jim has triggered the siren.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:58.560
Major West and Davis drive to the blockade&nbsp;
to investigate. Having seen movements,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:02.480
Davis climbs a ladder to investigate, only&nbsp;
for Jim to hit him on the head with a crowbar.

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:06.560
Major West hears the commotion and follows&nbsp;
the sound. He spots Davis back in their jeep,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:11.040
but when he opens the door, he realizes that&nbsp;
Davis is dead. Major West drags Davis' body&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:14.880
off the driver seat and gets in. He finds the&nbsp;
jeep is sabotaged, unable to start. Infected&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:18.480
people attack him, but he quickly disposes&nbsp;
of them. He goes back to their base on foot.

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:24.160
Back at the Worsley House, Jim uses Davis' gun&nbsp;
to free Mailer. Inside, the soldiers guard Selena&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:28.640
and Hannah, who are now wearing red dresses. They&nbsp;
hear gunshots outside, and Jones becomes nervous.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:33.360
Mitchell and Bedford head down to investigate,&nbsp;
leaving Jones and Clifton with the women. Hannah&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:37.600
tells Selena that she feels the pills already&nbsp;
affecting her. The dazed Hannah unnerves Jones.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:42.160
Mailer appears from the window and grabs&nbsp;
Clifton, vomiting in his face. Selena takes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:46.640
Hannah and leads her out of danger. When Mailer&nbsp;
turns his eyes on Jones, he scrambles away.

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:50.800
Selena and Hannah head to the exit but are blocked&nbsp;
by Mitchell and Bedford. They watch Jones getting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:54.800
chased by Mailer. Mitchell orders Bedford&nbsp;
to help Jones while he deals with the women.

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:58.240
Jim peers into the window, looking for the&nbsp;
women. Instead, he sees Mailer tracking down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:01.520
Jones into the kitchen. Bedford confidently&nbsp;
stands in the way, ready to shoot Mailer,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:05.520
but is attacked by the infected Clifton. Jones&nbsp;
is hiding inside the cupboards, frightened.

00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:08.640
As Mitchell leads the women to&nbsp;
Bell upstairs, Hannah wanders off.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:10.880
Selena screams for her, but Hannah ignores them.

00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:13.920
With the kitchen going quiet, Jones&nbsp;
thinks it's safe for him to escape.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:17.040
He comes out of the cupboard and runs&nbsp;
to the exit, only to be stabbed by Jim.

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:21.520
Now inside the house, Jim avoids&nbsp;
the infected. Major West arrives,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:24.320
finding Jones by the door. He&nbsp;
comforts the dying soldier.

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:28.240
Hannah finds the photo of her family&nbsp;
amongst her old clothes in the bathroom.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:31.280
The infected Clifton enters the bathroom,&nbsp;
but Hannah hides behind the mirror.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.440
Jim frantically searches for the&nbsp;
women, going door to door. Instead,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:39.840
he finds Bell hiding behind the couch. Bell&nbsp;
ran out of bullets and begs Jim not to leave.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:43.760
Clifton and Mailer break the door open and&nbsp;
attack Bell. Jim exits through the window.

00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:48.560
Spotting Selena's red dress from another window,&nbsp;
Jim goes inside. Selena and Mitchell hear him, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:53.040
Mitchell drags Selena back. Jim attacks Mitchell,&nbsp;
brutally slamming his head and gouging his eyes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:57.520
Scared, Selena mistakes that Jim is infected.&nbsp;
She nearly attacks him with her machete until&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:00.960
she realizes that he was okay. The two&nbsp;
share a kiss when Hannah walks in and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:04.400
breaks a bottle on Jim's head. Selena&nbsp;
assures her that Jim was not infected.

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:08.640
The trio head out, retrieving Frank's&nbsp;
car. Hannah gets into the driver's seat&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:12.160
but finds Major West waiting for them in&nbsp;
the backseat. He shoots Jim in the stomach.

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:17.520
Hannah puts the car in reverse, forcing the car&nbsp;
back into the house. Major West tries to stop her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:21.200
but Mailer breaks the rear window and forces&nbsp;
him out of the vehicle. Selena helps the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:25.840
wounded Jim into the car, and they drive off,&nbsp;
leaving Major West with his infected soldiers.

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:28.000
Hannah warns the two that the gates are locked.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.720
Jim encourages her to drive straight&nbsp;
to it, and they crash onto the gate.

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:35.600
Twenty-eight days later, Jim wakes up after&nbsp;
dreaming of being revived by Selena in a hospital.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:39.280
The three found a remote cottage near a lake&nbsp;
where Selena stitches large amounts of fabric,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:41.200
and Hannah sets more fabric outside in the field.

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:44.400
Back in the city, the infected&nbsp;
are slowly dying of starvation.

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:48.480
Hannah storms inside their new home,&nbsp;
alerting the two that something is coming.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:51.840
The three grab the fabric from the sewing&nbsp;
machine and set it down on the field.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:55.280
They wait expectantly until they spot a&nbsp;
fighter jet pass them. The fabric they've&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:58.720
set up spells HELLO on the field, alerting the&nbsp;
pilot that they are survivors to be rescued.
