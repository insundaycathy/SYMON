00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:06.560
Welcome Back to Movie Recaps. Today I will show&nbsp;
you a horror film from 2019, entitled Countdown.&nbsp;

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.720
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.400
A few young people can be seen sitting around&nbsp;
a table at a house party. The girls talk about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.880
counting calories, so one of them shows an app on&nbsp;
her phone for keeping track of your food intake.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.840
The other one wants to download it, but searching&nbsp;
for that app she finds another one called simply&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.240
"Countdown". The others asks about it and she&nbsp;
reads the description which states that it can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.960
tell you exactly when you're going to die. All&nbsp;
of them, except Courtney, want to make a drinking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.560
game out of it, with the one with the least to&nbsp;
live will drink everything that's on the table.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.600
Courtney reluctantly does it too and accepts&nbsp;
the terms and conditions. They go around the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.640
table and everyone gets 60 to 30 years of life.&nbsp;
Courtney looks upset as she shows them that she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.360
only has 3 hours to live. The rest make fun of&nbsp;
her and tell her that she has to abide by the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.440
rules of the game and drink, when her boyfriend&nbsp;
Evan comes over and drinks instead of her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.360
Later, the two of them are going over to&nbsp;
his car. His visibly drunk. When they enter,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.240
she asks him to walk her to her house and not&nbsp;
drive home, but he doesn't want to. She gets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.960
out and starts walking, while he tries to convince&nbsp;
her to come back in and when he doesn't succeed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:16.560
he dives off angrily. Courtney gets a message from&nbsp;
the app, saying she's broken the user agreement.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.360
As she continues walking it looks like somebody&nbsp;
is following her. The app says she has less then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.000
2 minutes to live, prompting her to run into&nbsp;
her house, as the app continues to blare on her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000
phone. She powers it off. Courtney walks into the&nbsp;
bathroom and becomes increasingly paranoid, so she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.640
checks the shower curtain. Then she goes to drink&nbsp;
some water, but hears the curtains move again.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.200
She turns around, but something grabs her&nbsp;
from above and drops her on the shower,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.880
breaking her head. She dies when the countdown&nbsp;
timer runs down to zero. Meanwhile, Evan was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.200
in a car accident and the passengers seat where&nbsp;
Courtney was supposed to be is completely trashed.&nbsp;

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.920
Quinn can be seen exiting an elevator,&nbsp;
rolling a nurses cart through a hospital.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.480
She walks into a room, discovering that one&nbsp;
of the patients hasn't finished his lunch.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.760
She knows where to find him. His sitting on&nbsp;
a balcony in a closed wing of the hospital.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.320
It's Evan. She sits with him and tries to&nbsp;
make small talk to relax him for surgery,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.480
but he shows her the "countdown" app, which&nbsp;
says the he has only around 19 hours left.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.040
He tells her about the app and his girlfriend,&nbsp;
convinced that it knew when she was going to die.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:24.240
Evan thinks that the app also knows that he will&nbsp;
die during his surgery. Quinn tells him not to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:29.120
worry about the app and makes him come back to his&nbsp;
room. They meet Amy on the way and she tells Quinn&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.560
to come with her. The hospital staff surprises her&nbsp;
with a cake because she passed the nurses test. As&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.720
they're sitting and eating cake, Quinn jokes about&nbsp;
the app and some of the others have already heard&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.360
about it. They laugh about it when Scott gets more&nbsp;
than 50 years to live and so does Doctor Sullivan.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.960
Suddenly, a man walks in carrying a woman that's&nbsp;
overdosing. The doctor checks her right there on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.120
the floor and Amy tells Quinn to bring the kit&nbsp;
with the drugs to counteract what she's taken.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.160
Amy administers it to the woman and she&nbsp;
wakes up. Later, Quinn is leaving work,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:03.680
when she gets an add for the app. She downloads it&nbsp;
and enters her information, agreeing to the terms.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.240
The app tells her that she has&nbsp;
little over 2 days to live.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.360
Suddenly Doctor Sullivan walks into the elevator&nbsp;
and flirts with her, but she tries to let him off&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:16.480
easy. That night, Quinn is at home finishing her&nbsp;
nursing documents, when she runs into a problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.880
She calls Scott to asks for help and he tells&nbsp;
her that she'll need to enter the information&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.600
from her birth certificate. Quinn doesn't have&nbsp;
it with her, but she knows where to find it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.160
She goes to get it from her parents house. Once&nbsp;
there, she sifts through her mom's papers and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.720
finds it on the bottom of the pile. Something&nbsp;
moves in the closet behind her and when she opens&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:40.080
it, she finds her sister Jordan there, along with&nbsp;
her boyfriend. He puts his clothes on and leaves,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.560
but Quinn scolds her sister about it. Jordan&nbsp;
is angry with her for parenting her and not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:49.360
coming over to see her more often after their&nbsp;
mom died. Quinn goes to her room to apologize&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.920
and tell her about finishing her studies, when&nbsp;
her father wakes and comes to greet her. He's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.080
happy to see Quinn and asks her if she wants to&nbsp;
come with them to visit her mom's grave one day.&nbsp;

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:03.280
The next day, Evan is preparing for his surgery&nbsp;
and sees that he has around three minutes to live.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.760
He leaves the room and the app pushes a&nbsp;
notification on his phone telling him he's broken&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:12.560
the agreement. Evan sees a deathly figure behind&nbsp;
him in the mirror, but no one's there in real&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:18.880
life. He escapes to the stairwell, but it follows.&nbsp;
The app continues to notify him of the countdown.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.280
Evan can't get out of the dark stairwell,&nbsp;
when he hears footsteps inside the stairwell.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.720
He uses the light on his phone,&nbsp;
but can't see anyone downstairs.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.000
Evan looks up and thinks he sees Courtney, but&nbsp;
it's something else and it's coming after him. His&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.200
phone drops down the stairs and when the countdown&nbsp;
reaches zero, he falls down too. A little later,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:42.720
Quinn comes to work and Amy informs her about&nbsp;
Evan. She remembers the app and seems disturbed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:47.040
Then Quinn goes to his room and when she sees her&nbsp;
colleague packing it up, she tells her that she'll&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:52.240
take over. She finds his phone and realizing she&nbsp;
needs his fingerprint to open it, goes to see his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:56.960
body in the basement facility.Quinn tries to open&nbsp;
his phone with his thumb, but because it doesn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.920
work she tries again with his face. She opens&nbsp;
his eyes and manages to open the phone finally,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:07.280
only to see the countdown has reached zero.&nbsp;
Suddenly, his hand falls and touches her, so she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:12.800
drops the phone. When she picks it up, his head is&nbsp;
turned and he's looking at her. She puts the body&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.600
back inside the freezer. Quinn checks her phone&nbsp;
to see that she has less than two days to live and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:22.400
the countdown time is at the same hour when she'll&nbsp;
meet her father and sister at her mother's grave.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:27.280
She calls her dad and cancels their plan. The app&nbsp;
sends her a notification that she's broken the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:32.240
user agreement, when there's a figure in the room&nbsp;
she passes. She comes back and no one's there.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:37.760
Suddenly, Doctor Sullivan scares her. He asks&nbsp;
her to help with a patient, but she has trouble&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:42.480
with a machine. She wants to leave and he&nbsp;
stops her trying to awkwardly comfort her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:47.920
The doctor makes another advance on her and she&nbsp;
declines, but he keeps going. When she pushes him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:52.640
off, he pseudo apologizes, so she goes to find&nbsp;
nurse Amy and tell her about what's happened.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:57.840
Before she can say anything, the doctor calls&nbsp;
for Amy and she doesn't get to tell her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:02.880
The app flashes another notification.
That night, Quinn tries to delete the app,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:07.680
but can't so she searches for it online and&nbsp;
finds information about Courtney. She watches&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:12.240
a video from a girl ranting about the app, saying&nbsp;
that she's seeing things, like her dead cousin.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:18.320
Suddenly, the girl says her time is up, then&nbsp;
she sees something, screams and drops her phone.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:23.280
The comments under the video say it's a fake, so&nbsp;
Quinn relaxes a little bit and shuts her laptop,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:28.240
when suddenly she sees dead Evan. Her phone&nbsp;
pushes another notification, so she breaks it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:32.880
but it still shows the countdown. Quinn&nbsp;
gets in her car and falls asleep there.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:37.120
Jordan wakes her up in the morning. The two&nbsp;
of them go up to her apartment and her sister&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:41.600
finds her smashed up phone, seeing the app and&nbsp;
telling her she only has one more day to live.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:45.680
She jokes with her when she figures out&nbsp;
the app and then asks to stay with her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:49.600
because their dad went on a last&nbsp;
minute work trip. When Quinn refuses,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:54.160
Jordan storms out. The app beeps again and&nbsp;
she scratches her finger on the broken screen.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:54.720 --> 00:07:00.560
Later, she's in a shop, buying a new phone. Quinn&nbsp;
opens it even before the guy can run her card. She&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:05.760
gets a completely new phone and sim card, so she&nbsp;
checks if the app is there. When she doesn't see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:10.480
it, she goes to leave, but another notification&nbsp;
arrives and the app is on the new phone as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:16.080
She asks the guy about the app and he tries to&nbsp;
delete it, but can't. When she finally leaves,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:20.880
one of the other customers asks the store guy&nbsp;
about the app. Quinn is in her car, checking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:25.920
the app which has continued to count down, then&nbsp;
suddenly sees a deathly figure in her back camera.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:31.680
It can only be seen there. Suddenly, it grabs her&nbsp;
from the back seat and she rams into another car,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:36.080
falling out of her own. The guy from the other&nbsp;
car screams at her, while the customer from the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:41.120
store walks out and tells him to stop. He scares&nbsp;
him away, then shows her he also has the app.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:46.240
Later, they're seen in a bar, talking about&nbsp;
it. She says they should find a way to see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:50.720
the user agreement for the app again and Matt&nbsp;
tells the crazy guy in the bar to download it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:54.720
They go over to him and when he reaches&nbsp;
the terms and conditions page, Quinn starts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:59.680
reading them. It says that they have to accept&nbsp;
their fate. The crazy guy still agrees to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:04.960
terms and the app tells him that he'll live to 91.
Quinn and Matt go to the hospital and speak to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:09.520
priest. They ask him what he knows about demons,&nbsp;
but he says that he doesn't believe in them and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:15.440
sends them to someone else. Before they leave, Amy&nbsp;
asks to talk to Quinn. Matt goes to the restroom.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.600
Someone wants to get inside his stall and&nbsp;
he sees a barefoot child under the door.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:24.720
As he's washing his hands, he hears someone crying&nbsp;
in one of the stalls and when he goes to check,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:29.280
he sees the barefoot kid again, walking through&nbsp;
the stalls like there's nothing in between.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:33.440
It stops at the last stall. The lights&nbsp;
go out and Matt goes to check the stall.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.520
There is nothing in there, but something&nbsp;
appears behind him and calls his name.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:42.560
It attacks him and when the lights come&nbsp;
back on, it isn't there anymore. Meanwhile,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:47.600
Amy takes Quinn to a meeting with HR and Doctor&nbsp;
Sullivan. He says that she was the one to corner&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:52.880
him and not the other way around. The man from HR&nbsp;
says that she'll get suspended, when Quinn starts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:58.560
explaining her side of the story. Amy confronts&nbsp;
her, but Quinn storms out. Matt is waiting for her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:02.800
and he doesn't tell her what's happened. He keeps&nbsp;
hearing the voice of the thing that attacked him.&nbsp;

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:07.120
They walk into a church looking for the&nbsp;
man the other priest told them about.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:11.600
They find him in his office. He's super&nbsp;
excited that they ask him about demons and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:16.880
immediately thinks of an ancient story. In it,&nbsp;
a prince gets a scroll from an old gypsy woman,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:21.280
foretelling the exact hour in which he would&nbsp;
die. She heeds him a warning that he mustn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:25.920
use the information to alter his fate. But the&nbsp;
prince still does and goes back to the gypsy,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:30.480
telling her that death is after him. She tells&nbsp;
him that it's not death, but a demon that will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:35.440
torture him until the moment he dies as the scroll&nbsp;
foretold. He tells them to find someone to hack&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:40.880
the app for them. They go to the store guy - Derek&nbsp;
for help and bribe him to help them. He knows the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:45.360
app and makes fun of them for believing it, but&nbsp;
he still hacks it for them. The code for the app&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:50.240
is in Latin. They also find the countdowns for&nbsp;
all the people using the app inside the code,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:55.280
including Derek's. He changes all the parameters&nbsp;
for his countdown, then looks for Quinn, when they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:55.280 --> 00:10:00.720
find her sister's countdown too. Her clock is&nbsp;
almost the same as hers, so Dereck changes it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:05.200
Jordan sees the change on her phone, but the&nbsp;
woman who's watching her, takes her phone.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:10.000
Matt and Quinn thank Derek for changing their&nbsp;
countdowns as he's driving away. Then Quinn asks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.400
Matt to stay with her that night. They are getting&nbsp;
ready for bed and even leave the lights on because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:19.200
they're still sacred. Matt tells her a story about&nbsp;
his dead brother and she tells him about her mom.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:24.000
They were both bad to them before they died.&nbsp;
The two of them are sleeping in the bed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.400
when the lights go out. Quinn hears something&nbsp;
in front of the room and tries to wake Matt up,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:33.040
but the demon is the one in bed with her. When&nbsp;
the real Matt takes off her covers, the demon&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:38.320
disappears. The app still goes back to their&nbsp;
original countdown. Quinn remembers her sister's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:43.520
countdown. Meanwhile, Jordan hears her phone&nbsp;
ring in the old woman's room and goes to get it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:47.200
She sees that her countdown has changed,&nbsp;
when something appears in front of her room.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:52.800
Jordan goes to check it out and the lights go out&nbsp;
again. She goes back into her room and closes the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:57.520
door, but when she turns around the door is&nbsp;
open. Then, she hides under her bed and hears&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:02.560
her mom calling to her, asking for her sister.&nbsp;
Something pushes her bed aside and suddenly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:06.720
her dead mother appears. Jordan runs to the&nbsp;
front door and Quinn and Matt are there.&nbsp;

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:11.840
They go to see the demon priest again.&nbsp;
He reads the code in Latin for them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:16.080
It's a curse that he can find a way to brake and&nbsp;
lift from them. He thinks that if they can keep&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:20.960
one of them alive longer than what the app says,&nbsp;
the curse will be broken. His plan is to hide in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:25.600
a blessed circle of salt long enough to keep one&nbsp;
of them alive, so that they can lift the curse.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:29.920
Quinn mixes the salt with paint and as they are&nbsp;
laying it on the ground, the priest blesses the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:35.920
salt. The circle is painted on the floor, when&nbsp;
they check Matts countdown timer. He steps aside,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:41.040
panicking, but Quinn kisses him. The lights&nbsp;
go out and all of them get inside the circle.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:46.160
As the demon approaches, the priest is praying.&nbsp;
The demon appears behind them, but it can't get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:50.720
inside the circle. The priest tries to vanquish&nbsp;
it back to hell, when the app starts blaring.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:56.320
Suddenly, a toy robot reaches the circle that&nbsp;
only Matt can see. His brother appears and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:01.600
lures him out of the circle. The demon grabs&nbsp;
him and drags him away. Quinn runs after him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:06.480
but as she reaches Matt, a car hits him and&nbsp;
he dies with the countdown. Jordan is hurt,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:11.600
so Quinn takes her to the hospital. As a doctor is&nbsp;
taking care of her sister, one of her colleagues&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:15.120
tells her that she knows what happened with&nbsp;
Doctor Sullivan and that she will be with her if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:20.080
she goes after him. They hug, but Quinn sees the&nbsp;
doctor talking to her sister and goes over there.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:25.120
She thanks him, but has some kind of plan for&nbsp;
him. Jordan tells Quinn that their mother's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:29.520
death was her fault and not Quinn's, but she&nbsp;
says it's none of their fault. The two of them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:34.160
reconcile and Jordan says that at least they will&nbsp;
spend the last minutes of their lives together.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:39.280
Quinn doesn't think they will die, because she has&nbsp;
a plan. She goes into Doctor Sullivan's office and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:44.000
apologizes to him, manipulating him. He sees&nbsp;
right through her and asks her what she wants.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:49.520
She says she wants her job back and tells him to&nbsp;
follow her into the closed wing. Moments later,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:53.920
the doctor walks in and looks for her around the&nbsp;
closed wing, finding pieces of her clothing on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:59.200
the ground. Quinn is playing a game with him.&nbsp;
Suddenly, she hits him with a wrench and wants&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:05.040
to inject him with morphine, when Jordan shows up&nbsp;
and stops her. The demon drags the doctor away.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:09.120
Quinn thinks that if she kills him before his&nbsp;
countdown it will break the curse, so she goes to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:13.760
find him. Jordan looks for her, as her app shows&nbsp;
her that she has less than 2 minutes to live.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:18.960
Suddenly the demon appears behind her.&nbsp;
Meanwhile, Quinn is still looking for the doctor,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:23.680
when she hears something. He knocks her out and&nbsp;
gets ready to kill her, but she comes after him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:29.840
again. She chases him down, but the demon pushes&nbsp;
her away and he escapes. Quinn gets another idea.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:35.120
Simultaneously, Jordan is being chased&nbsp;
by the demon. She tries to hide from it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:40.000
but her app gives her position away. A freezer&nbsp;
opens and she goes over to investigate,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.640
when the demon grabs her and throws her through&nbsp;
a window. Her time is running out as the demon&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:49.200
closes in to kill her, when suddenly Quinn shows&nbsp;
up with a syringe pushed up against her skin,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:54.080
telling it to let her sister go. Jordan begs her&nbsp;
not to kill herself and the demon turns into her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:59.120
mother, diverting her attention. Jordan's time&nbsp;
is ticking and Quinn is distracted for a moment,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:04.080
but she realizes what's happening and shoots the&nbsp;
morphine in her veins. She dies before her time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:09.680
and the demon can't take her. Quinn has lifted the&nbsp;
demon's curse. Jordan cries over her sister's dead&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:14.880
body, when she sees the name of a drug written&nbsp;
on her arm and a bottle rolling away. She injects&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:18.480
it into Quinn's arm and it counteracts the&nbsp;
morphine, bringing her back from the dead.&nbsp;

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:23.520
Some time later, Quinn, Jordan and their&nbsp;
father visit their mom's gravesite. As&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:27.360
they're about to leave, Quinn gets a&nbsp;
notification. The beta version of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:32.320
"Countdown" app has been installed on her phone.
In an after credits scene, Derek is seen on a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:36.720
date with a woman in a restaurant. His date is&nbsp;
disappointed and goes to the restroom before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:40.880
they leave. Derek gets a notification&nbsp;
from the app, counting his minutes down.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:45.280
The lights go out and a demonic sound&nbsp;
can be heard, along with Derek's screams.
