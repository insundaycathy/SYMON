Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:07.439
Today, I'm going to explain a crime, drama,
thriller film called "The Silence of the Lambs."

00:00:07.439 --> 00:00:08.890
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:12.670
Watch out and take care.

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:17.900
In 1990, an F.B.I.-in-training, Clarice Starling,
is called to the office of Jack Crawford from

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.169
the Bureau's Behavioral Science Unit.

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:24.650
In hopes of capturing the serial killer known
as Buffalo Bill, Jack assigns Clarice to interview

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.890
notorious psychiatrist-turned-cannibal Dr.
Hannibal Lecter.

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.110
However, before she leaves, Jack warns Clarice
not to talk about anything personal to avoid

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.220
getting Hannibal in her head.

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:41.760
At the Baltimore State Forensic Hospital,
Dr. Frederick Chilton welcomes Clarice but

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.010
makes suggestive remarks at her.

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.450
Chilton explains that they haven't progressed
with studying Hannibal's psyche despite his

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:52.820
years in the facility, but letting an attractive
young woman such as Clarice may have a chance.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.960
Chilton lists down strict rules to safely
talk with Hannibal.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.231
The precautions were set due to Hannibal biting
a nurse who performed an E.K.G. on him after

00:01:00.231 --> 00:01:01.860
complaining about chest pains.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:07.010
Due to Chilton's animosity against Hannibal
and his crude remarks about her, Clarice decides

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.610
to talk to Hannibal without assistance.

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.680
Heart pounding, Clarice walks down the hall
filled with imprisoned inmates, keeping her

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.390
chin up to show confidence.

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.240
Before Hannibal's cell, an inmate named Migs
gawks at her.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.790
At the end of the hall, she sees Hannibal
Lecter standing, already expecting her.

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.970
Unlike the other inmates who are behind iron
bars, Hannibal's cell is behind reinforced

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:29.970
glass.

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.440
He gazes at her with interest, already deducing
that she's Jack Crawford's colleague.

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.000
Even when he notes from her I.D. that she's
still an F.B.I. trainee, Clarice refuses to

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.470
falter.

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.810
Clarice notices Hannibal's sketch of the Duomo
in Florence, Italy, admiring his ability to

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.400
draw from memory.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:51.060
She diverts the topic to the F.B.I. questionnaire
she was sent to give, but this loses Hannibal's

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.060
interest.

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.840
He knows that Jack intends to use him to understand
and eventually arrest Buffalo Bill.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.111
When asked why Buffalo Bill skins his victims,
Clarice believes that it's his trophies, as

00:02:01.111 --> 00:02:03.690
most serial killers keep them.

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.850
Hannibal denies keeping trophies.

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.210
Clarice casually adds that he ate his victims
instead.

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:13.090
Her demeanor interests him, so Hannibal accepts
the questionnaire.

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.580
Hannibal finds it amusing the notion that
this would help them study him.

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.490
Hannibal starts listing down his observations
of Clarice, from her clothes to the accent

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.340
she tries to hide.

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.080
Clarice's speech finally falters as she challenges
him to use his keen observation on himself,

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.740
insinuating that he's afraid to do so.

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.440
Hannibal returns the questionnaire, sliding
the box loudly to startle her.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.370
He leans to the glass as he recounts how a
census taker tried to test him, and Hannibal

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:38.670
ate his liver.

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.970
The story fills Clarice with dread.

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.849
Slowly, she walks away but stops when Migs
flicks bodily fluids onto her face, starting

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:47.370
a commotion.

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.630
Hannibal shouts for Clarice, apologizing to
her for the other inmates' behavior.

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.410
As compensation, he offers the name Moffet
and that she should "look into yourself" to

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.610
help her investigation.

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.030
Clarice walks out of the facility, unnerved
and in tears.

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.810
She comforts herself as she remembers welcoming
her father back home when she was a girl.

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.599
Later that day, Clarice browses through the
newspaper reports on Hannibal Lecter's case.

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:14.480
Jack calls to inform her that Migs has passed
away after swallowing his tongue.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.790
In addition, the guards reported that Hannibal
was whispering to the inmate before the event.

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.710
The news fills Clarice with terror, thinking
of Hannibal's irritation at Migs' behavior

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:24.910
towards her.

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.739
But she doesn't share this with Jack, who
believes that Hannibal did it to amuse himself.

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:34.989
Jack asks about the name Moffet, unable to
find the name among Hannibal's old patients.

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:38.410
Clarice deduced that the phrase "look into
yourself" was too vague for Hannibal, which

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:43.660
led her to Your Self Storage Facility in Baltimore,
near where Hannibal used to live.

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.410
The keeper tells her that a person named "Miss
Hester Moffet" rents a unit at the storage

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:48.940
facility.

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:53.040
Inside the unit, Clarice finds a car with
a headless mannequin inside.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.680
Removing a handkerchief from a jar, she discovers
a severed head inside.

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.540
Clarice heads back to the hospital to confront
Hannibal.

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.849
She sits on the floor in front of a T.V. set
while Hannibal sits in the dark.

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:08.769
Hannibal tells her that the head is his former
patient, Benjamin Raspail, whom he assures

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:11.160
that he didn't kill but only kept his head.

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.040
He suggests that Raspail was killed as an
experiment.

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.900
The lights turn on, revealing that Hannibal's
sketches have been taken away as punishment

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.260
for Migs' demise.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.770
The gospel television program behind Clarice
is also part of his punishment.

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:29.160
Hannibal bargains to be transferred to a federal
prison with a view, away from Dr. Chilton,

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.650
in return for giving his psychological profile
on Buffalo Bill.

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:38.580
At Memphis, Tennessee, Catherine Martin enjoys
music while driving back home.

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.560
A man with night vision goggles spots her,
eyeing her as prey.

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.990
As she heads to her apartment, Catherine spots
a man trying to load an armchair into his

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.990
truck.

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.770
She offers her help, seeing the man's injured
arm.

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.260
Catherine hops into the truck to position
the chair inside, but the man punches her

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.540
several times, knocking her out.

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:01.230
He checks the size of her coat, happy to see
that she's a size 14, before cutting her blouse

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:02.940
and throwing it on the parking lot.

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:07.530
On their way to investigate a new body found,
Jack gives Clarice the case files, explaining

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:11.960
how Buffalo Bill keeps the victims for three
days and all injuries are post-mortem.

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:16.949
The bodies are always found in the river after
the water had washed off any evidence.

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:21.190
Clarice suggests that Buffalo Bill is a Caucasian
male in his thirties to forties based on the

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:22.260
evidence.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:27.140
She believes that he will not stop anytime
soon, not after he has perfected his work.

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:32.600
Arriving at the funeral home, Jack talks to
Sheriff Perkins regarding the case.

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:36.729
Jack requests to speak about the delicate
case in private, eyeing Clarice.

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:41.410
The men are uncomfortable with her involvement
in a serial case that targets women.

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:46.540
Wanting to leave the awkward situation, Clarice
looks into a funeral ceremony in another room,

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:48.509
remembering her father's funeral.

00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:52.430
In the autopsy room, Clarice sees the body
for the first time.

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:56.680
She is visibly bothered but pushes on, recording
her findings on a tape recorder.

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:00.540
First, she notes the woman is from the city
and that the dirt under her nails suggests

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:03.039
that she tried to claw her way out of something.

00:06:03.039 --> 00:06:06.039
Next, Clarice notices something in the body's
throat.

00:06:06.039 --> 00:06:08.770
Inside, they find a cocoon.

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:13.110
On their way back to the agency, Jack explains
to Clarice that he only told the sheriff not

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:16.770
to discuss the case in front of her to get
rid of him and his men.

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:20.810
With the help of friends, Clarice learns that
the cocoon is from a death's head moth, which

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:22.590
originates in Asia.

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:26.240
Given this, someone specifically raised them
in this area.

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:30.490
The news reports the disappearance of Senator
Ruth Martin's daughter, Catherine, who is

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:33.070
believed to be taken by Buffalo Bill.

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:36.479
This puts the Buffalo Bill case in the government's
attention.

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:40.630
Senator Martin pleads on television, repeating
Catherine's name several times to humanize

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:42.800
Catherine in Bill's eyes.

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:46.370
With the recent development, Clarice revisits
Hannibal.

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:50.630
Clarice relays the senator's offer to transfer
Hannibal to a maximum security facility in

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:54.759
exchange for helping them profile Buffalo
Bill in time to save Catherine.

00:06:54.759 --> 00:06:59.870
But Hannibal demands Clarice to share personal
stories in exchange for his compliance.

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:04.430
Clarice tells the story of her father, a town
marshall who passed away while on the job.

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:09.460
Her mother was also gone when she was very
young, leaving her orphaned at ten years old.

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:13.630
For Hannibal's turn, he asks if Catherine
was a large woman; Clarice confirms that all

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:15.910
of Buffalo Bill's victims were.

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:19.539
She informs him about the moth they found
in the previous body and reveals they found

00:07:19.539 --> 00:07:21.170
the same cocoon in Raspail's head.

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:25.741
Hannibal points out that the moth's cocoon
symbolizes transformation, and Buffalo Bill

00:07:25.741 --> 00:07:28.110
wants to change as well.

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:30.330
Hannibal asks more about her story.

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:33.360
Clarice tells him about moving to her mother's
cousin's ranch.

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:37.740
She lived there for two months until she ran
away but not because of abuse.

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:39.460
Clarice then demands his turn.

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:43.310
Hannibal figures that Bill had applied for
transexual surgery but was denied due to his

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:44.580
mental condition.

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:47.979
He suggests that Buffalo Bill hates his own
identity and wants to change.

00:07:47.979 --> 00:07:54.400
In a dark room, Buffalo Bill orders Catherine
to use lotion on herself.

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:57.650
Frightened and stuck inside a well, Catherine
does so.

00:07:57.650 --> 00:08:00.509
She tries to negotiate, bringing up her mother.

00:08:00.509 --> 00:08:03.389
Bill ignores her, calling her "it" to dehumanize
her.

00:08:03.389 --> 00:08:07.350
Bill lowers a lighted basket to retrieve the
lotion, letting Catherine see the bloody claw

00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:08.950
marks on the wall.

00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:12.080
She screams in fear, with Bill mocking her.

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:15.970
Back at the cell, Hannibal is strapped to
a gurney with a muzzle on his face.

00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:20.099
Chilton recorded Hannibal's conversation with
Clarice and tells him that Clarice's deal

00:08:20.099 --> 00:08:21.340
was fake.

00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:23.950
Chilton made a different deal with Senator
Martin.

00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:28.449
He demands Buffalo Bill's name in exchange
for being transferred to a state prison in

00:08:28.449 --> 00:08:29.449
Tennessee.

00:08:29.449 --> 00:08:33.050
All the while, Hannibal stares down at a pen
that Chilton leaves behind.

00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:35.579
His mind is working on a plan.

00:08:35.579 --> 00:08:39.159
Hannibal gives the name Louis but will reveal
the last name only when he has met the senator

00:08:39.159 --> 00:08:40.729
in Memphis.

00:08:40.729 --> 00:08:45.240
In the airport, Hannibal is wheeled in, completely
strapped to his gurney.

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:48.990
Senator Martin arrives, hoping that the doctor
will help find her daughter.

00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:52.489
She offers Hannibal an affidavit of their
deal, but he wants to jump ahead with the

00:08:52.489 --> 00:08:53.499
case.

00:08:53.499 --> 00:08:58.529
He tells them that Buffalo Bill is Louis Friend,
who was introduced to him by Raspail.

00:08:58.529 --> 00:09:02.430
With the breakthrough, Chilton enjoys the
press' attention, allowing Clarice to pass

00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:04.350
his security.

00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:08.870
Clarice meets Hannibal in his new cell, returning
his old sketches as a peace offering.

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:11.819
He taunts her for wasting time with the fake
deal.

00:09:11.819 --> 00:09:16.610
Clarice retorts back about Louis Friend, deducing
that it's an anagram for Iron Sulfide, otherwise

00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:18.779
known as Fool's Gold.

00:09:18.779 --> 00:09:22.610
Hannibal tells her that Buffalo Bill covets
something, asking Clarice why people covet

00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:24.029
anything at all.

00:09:24.029 --> 00:09:28.059
He demands more of her story, as they agreed
upon in his old cell.

00:09:28.059 --> 00:09:31.990
Knowing that Chilton can find her any minute,
she begs Hannibal to skip her story, but the

00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:33.649
doctor insists.

00:09:33.649 --> 00:09:38.519
Defeated, Clarice reveals that she ran one
early morning after hearing screams.

00:09:38.519 --> 00:09:42.749
She went to the barn and saw the lambs screaming
as they were being slaughtered.

00:09:42.749 --> 00:09:45.529
Clarice tried to free them, but the lambs
didn't run.

00:09:45.529 --> 00:09:50.420
So instead, she took one lamb and ran away
with it, wanting to save one life at least.

00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:54.899
But the lamb was too heavy for her to carry,
so she was caught not long after.

00:09:54.899 --> 00:09:59.940
Because of this, she was sent to an orphanage,
and the lamb she tried to save was still slaughtered.

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:02.540
Clarice still hears the lambs screaming at
night.

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:06.860
Hannibal suggests that if she could save Catherine,
maybe the lambs would stop.

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:10.910
Before Hannibal could say any further, Dr.
Chilton arrives, bringing officers to take

00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:12.269
Clarice away.

00:10:12.269 --> 00:10:16.079
Hannibal hands Clarice his copy of the case
file, which she hurriedly takes before being

00:10:16.079 --> 00:10:17.490
pulled away.

00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:24.230
After Clarice leaves, Sergeant Pembrey and
Officer Boyle deliver Hannibal's dinner, cuffing

00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:26.199
him before opening his cell.

00:10:26.199 --> 00:10:30.600
Unbeknownst to them, Hannibal took a piece
of Chilton's pen to pick the lock.

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:33.880
Boyle lays down his meal on the floor as he
clears the table.

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:38.079
Once Boyle kneels to retrieve his tray, Hannibal
cuffs him then kicks the door on Pembrey's

00:10:38.079 --> 00:10:39.079
head.

00:10:39.079 --> 00:10:43.730
Hannibal bites Pembrey's face, and pepper
sprays him before whacking Boyle with a baton.

00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:48.070
Knowing his escape is inevitable, he takes
his time before pursuing Pembrey.

00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:52.089
Downstairs, the officers notice the elevator
heading up to the fifth floor.

00:10:52.089 --> 00:10:55.329
Shots are fired from afar, alerting all the
officers.

00:10:55.329 --> 00:10:59.730
They wait for the elevator to head down, but
it stops at the third floor.

00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:04.929
Sergeant Tate calls in the SWAT team for backup
as he and his team investigate the third floor.

00:11:04.929 --> 00:11:09.009
They check Hannibal's cell, seeing Boyle's
body propped like an angel.

00:11:09.009 --> 00:11:11.759
Pembrey is down with a bloodied face yet still
alive.

00:11:11.759 --> 00:11:16.209
The officers load Pembrey into a gurney and
ride the elevator down the building.

00:11:16.209 --> 00:11:20.410
While inside, blood drips from the ceiling,
suggesting that Hannibal is on the roof of

00:11:20.410 --> 00:11:21.680
the elevator.

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:25.069
They spot him from above, unconscious with
a gun next to him.

00:11:25.069 --> 00:11:29.269
The officers shoot him on the leg to prevent
him from escaping, but there's still no movement.

00:11:29.269 --> 00:11:34.689
They open the elevator latch from the inside,
revealing a body with no skin on the face.

00:11:34.689 --> 00:11:39.360
In the ambulance, Hannibal removes the mask
he made out of Pembrey's skin.

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:42.880
Learning about Hannibal's escape, Clarice
is anxious but is sure that he won't come

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:43.990
after her.

00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:48.739
However, she and her friend find a note from
Hannibal in the case files he gave her, suggesting

00:11:48.739 --> 00:11:51.869
that there's a pattern in Buffalo Bill's targets.

00:11:51.869 --> 00:11:55.309
Remembering Hannibal's comment about Bill
coveting something, Clarice concludes that

00:11:55.309 --> 00:11:59.730
Bill knew the first victim, Fredrica Bimmel.

00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:02.920
Clarice visits Fredrica's home and searches
her bedroom.

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:08.040
Inside a music box, Clarice finds polaroids
of Fredrica posing in her undergarments.

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:12.579
After seeing stitching supplies and an unfinished
dress in Fredrica's closet,

00:12:12.579 --> 00:12:16.629
Clarice deduces that Bill is making a skin
suit to turn himself into a woman.

00:12:16.629 --> 00:12:21.470
Jack tells her that they already located him
in Chicago, a man named Jame Gumb A.K.A.

00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:22.549
John Grant.

00:12:22.549 --> 00:12:26.170
Jack tells her to gather information to connect
Gumb to Bimmel so they can use it for the

00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:27.750
trial.

00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:33.690
Catherine asks Fredrica's friend, Stacy, if
she knew Jame Gumb or his other aliases, but

00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:36.009
Stacy doesn't recognize the name.

00:12:36.009 --> 00:12:40.579
Stacy mentions that she used to help Fredrica
make alterations for Mrs. Litman.

00:12:40.579 --> 00:12:43.739
Later in his house, Bill hears his dog whining.

00:12:43.739 --> 00:12:47.959
Catherine has successfully captured his dog,
Precious, and holds her hostage, enraging

00:12:47.959 --> 00:12:48.959
the man.

00:12:48.959 --> 00:12:52.509
Outside, a SWAT team prepares to ambush Gumb's
house.

00:12:52.509 --> 00:12:54.339
Bill hears the doorbell ring.

00:12:54.339 --> 00:12:56.319
He heads up and opens the door.

00:12:56.319 --> 00:12:58.879
But instead of the police, it's Clarice.

00:12:58.879 --> 00:13:03.009
Meanwhile, in Chicago, the SWAT team finds
the Gumb house empty.

00:13:03.009 --> 00:13:07.790
In Mrs. Litman's old home, Buffalo Bill introduces
himself as Jack Gordon.

00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:12.490
He invites Clarice inside, claiming that he
has Mrs. Litman's son's number for her to

00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:13.490
contact.

00:13:13.490 --> 00:13:17.339
Clarice walks inside, eyeing the cluttered
place while Jack looks for the number.

00:13:17.339 --> 00:13:20.309
Her eyes follow a moth landing on stitching
supplies.

00:13:20.309 --> 00:13:22.799
The puzzle pieces fall into place.

00:13:22.799 --> 00:13:26.350
Clarice aims her gun at him, but he retreats
to the basement.

00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:30.850
Clarice follows him, hearing Catherine's cries,
and Precious' barks from afar.

00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:34.889
Trembling in fear, Clarice breathes through
gritted teeth as she searches for Buffalo

00:13:34.889 --> 00:13:35.989
Bill.

00:13:35.989 --> 00:13:40.350
Clarice asks Catherine to be quiet, but the
woman continues to scream.

00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:44.249
Clarice enters from room to room, jumping
at every noise, knowing that Buffalo Bill

00:13:44.249 --> 00:13:46.220
is waiting to ambush her.

00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:48.939
As she enters the bathroom, the lights go
out.

00:13:48.939 --> 00:13:53.549
Buffalo Bill uses his night vision goggles
to watch the terrified Clarice.

00:13:53.549 --> 00:13:57.249
Clarice feels around the room and slips in
the darkness, not knowing that he's just behind

00:13:57.249 --> 00:13:58.249
her.

00:13:58.249 --> 00:14:01.019
Bill admires her for a while before pointing
his gun at her.

00:14:01.019 --> 00:14:03.589
The gun clicks, alerting Clarice.

00:14:03.589 --> 00:14:07.360
She turns and shoots, breaking the windows
to let light in while Buffalo Bill lies on

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:08.519
the floor.

00:14:08.519 --> 00:14:10.699
His crimes are finally over.

00:14:10.699 --> 00:14:14.899
Days later, Clarice happily receives her official
F.B.I. badge.

00:14:14.899 --> 00:14:18.360
Clarice thanks Jack for his mentorship and
the opportunity he gave her.

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:23.449
She takes a phone call, hearing Hannibal's
voice, asking if the lambs have stopped screaming.

00:14:23.449 --> 00:14:26.790
Hannibal promises not to pursue her, asking
her to do the same.

00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:29.149
But Clarice makes no promise.

00:14:29.149 --> 00:14:31.910
Hannibal ends the call as he's "having an
old friend for dinner."

00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:40.779
Hannibal follows Dr. Chilton in a foreign
village, finally able to get revenge on the

00:14:40.779 --> 00:14:44.959
doctor.
