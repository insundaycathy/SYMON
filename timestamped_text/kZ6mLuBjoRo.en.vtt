00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.720
Hello Guys, Welcome back to the channel, where
we recap movies for you. Today, we will be

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.530
recapping the movie called “Knock Knock”,
which has Keanu Reeves in it. Please turn

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:14.500
the subtitles on, if you have trouble understanding
me. So, let's get started, and spoilers ahead.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.119
At the start of the movie, we see that Evan
and his wife Karen are getting a little intimate

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.270
early in the morning. But, they are soon disturbed
by their two kids, who have brought a cake

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:26.440
for father’s day. They have even brought
him a gift. Evan opens it to find a clock

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.960
made by the two kids. Evan acts very excited
in front of his children, and thanks both

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.899
of them. Evan cuts the cake, but his children
push the cake to his face and run away. Evan

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:40.309
chases after them making a monster noise.
They seem like a very happy family.

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:44.949
The family sits to have lunch and celebrate
Father’s Day. Then, we see Louis, the assistant

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:49.829
of Karen. Karen is an artist, and she has
lots of her artwork at her house. In a few

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.909
days, her art was scheduled to be showcased
at an art gallery. And Louis was in charge

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:56.710
of moving her art to the art gallery on time.

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.690
After their lunch, the family plans a beach
trip, but Evan doesn’t join them. He has

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.650
a lot of work left from his office, and he
also has a shoulder injury which will keep

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.310
him from having fun with his family. So, Karen
and the kids leave without Evan.

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.660
That night, Evan is working alone at his house.
Evan is an architect and has been working

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:18.359
on a project for a few months. He receives
a call from his wife, and she informs that

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:22.270
they have reached the beach house. Karen says
that she misses him on this trip, and then

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:27.020
they hang up the phone. Evan works for a few
hours, and then he hears the doorbell ring.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.619
He goes to check, and finds two attractive
girls, and they’re both soaked wet with

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:34.740
the rain. The two girls introduce themselves
as Bel, and Genesis.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.500
They tell Evan that they were going to a party,
but they had lost their way. And with the

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.890
rain, they’re phones were also not working
properly. Trying to be a good person, Evan

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.830
welcomes them inside to shelter them from
the heavy rain.

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.240
Evan hands them towels to clean themselves
and also gives them his i-pad to contact their

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.240
friends.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.320
While Genesis is trying to contact their friends,
Bel thanks Evan for letting them inside. She

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.850
tells him that not everyone would have helped
them. Then, Genesis tells Bel that the party

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.189
address is pretty far from where they were.
So, Evan proposes that he will call a cab

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:09.149
for them. Evan books a cab, but it will take
it 45 minutes to arrive at his house.

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.849
45 minutes is a long wait, so the girls ask
Evan if they can use his dryer to dry their

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:18.140
clothes. Evan prepares them coffee and takes
their clothes to the dryer.

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.490
After that, they all sit to have a conversation.
Bel and Genesis ask Evan about his wife. Evan

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.040
answers that his wife and children were out
for a beach trip. Hearing that he was all

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.510
alone by himself on father’s day, they both
get up and hug him. Evan thinks nothing of

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.470
it, but when Genesis touches his arm, he feels
uncomfortable and goes to another chair.

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.670
After that, the two girls all of a sudden
start talking about their sex life. Evan gets

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.690
confused to see how open they both were. They
start asking Evan about his wife. Evan tells

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.340
them that his wife is an artist, and proudly
shows them the art catalog of his wife. Bel

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.840
and Genesis get close to Evan and say that
his wife is a very lucky woman. Evan gets

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.409
uncomfortable and sits away from them. He
checks his phone and the cab is 20 minutes

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:04.439
away. Genesis asks Evan if he has been with
any other woman after marriage. Evan answers

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:08.480
“No”. And Bel tells Evan that when she
gets married, she will let her husband sleep

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.220
with other women. That way she believes her
husband will never cheat on her. Evan is surprised

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:14.890
to hear this and nervously laughs.

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.780
All of a sudden, they both get close to him
and start seducing him. Evan again gets up

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.880
to get away from them. He checks his phone
and the cab is just 5 minutes away. Genesis

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.330
asks if she can use the bathroom and Evan
shows her the way. Evan gets up to play music,

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:34.340
and Bel starts to dance seductively. She pulls
Evan towards her and starts dancing with him.

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.819
Evan doesn’t know what to do, and they almost
kiss.

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:41.530
But, the phone rings, and Evan informs her
that the cab was here. Evan takes their clothes

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.640
out of the dryer and sees that the cab was
waiting for them. He takes the clothes to

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:50.219
them, and calls them from outside the bathroom.
After not getting any response, Evan goes

00:03:50.219 --> 00:03:54.939
inside to find both of them without clothes.
They both start seducing Evan, who keeps telling

00:03:54.939 --> 00:03:59.049
them that he is a married man and cannot do
this. But, the girls aren’t listening to

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:03.660
him and start touching him. Evan tries to
control himself, but he cannot stop what was

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.569
happening to him, and gives in to his pleasure.

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:11.250
After waiting for a long time, the cab driver
also leaves from there. That night, Evan sleeps

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:16.120
with both of them. Next morning, Evan gets
up and finds himself alone. The clothes from

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.670
the bathroom are also gone So, he thinks that
the girls were out of his house. But to his

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:25.970
surprise, he finds them in the kitchen, making
a total mess out of the place. Evan gets angry,

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:30.490
and wants them to leave. But the girls just
laugh and don’t listen to him. Just then,

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:35.360
Evan receives a call from his wife, he goes
outside to receive the call. He tries to speak

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.540
as if nothing weird is going on in the house,
but the girls start making weird noises from

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:44.380
inside. Evan starts to get distracted and
quickly ends the conversation. He loses his

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:48.890
temper and tells the girls to get out of his
house right now. He pushes them to get their

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:50.810
clothes and leave his house.

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:55.590
Evan goes to check and finds Genesis in her
clothes. But Bel isn’t there. So, he goes

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:00.820
to search for Bel and finds her in his closet.
Bel tries to seduce him again, and tells him

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:05.690
that she wants him before she leaves. But
this time, Evan is in his senses. He doesn’t

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:08.880
lose control and tells them to get out in
three minutes.

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.790
After a while, Evan goes to check on them,
but finds them totally destroying the artworks

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:17.540
of his wife. Evan gets furious and tells them
that if they don’t leave his house, he will

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:22.380
call the cops. Hearing his threat, Bel and
genesis start to laugh. They tell Evan that

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:26.180
they are both underage girls, and if Evan
calls the police, it will be him that will

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:27.370
go to jail.

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:31.451
Evan is shocked to hear this, and realizes
that he has made a huge mistake. Everything

00:05:31.451 --> 00:05:35.780
that they said yesterday was a lie, they were
just messing around with him. Evan tries to

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:39.550
give them money to leave him alone, but they
get angry at him and tell him that they’re

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:41.000
not prostitutes.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.320
Just then someone calls Evan from his door.
He goes to check and finds Karen’s friend.

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:50.400
She was there to ask if he needed help with
anything since he was alone by himself. Evan

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:54.870
gets nervous to see her. He tries to get her
out of there, but Genesis comes outside and

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:59.400
starts acting like his girlfriend. Karen’s
friend is disgusted to look at Evan and leaves

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:00.400
immediately.

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:05.040
Evan has had enough. He goes inside and tries
to force them to leave his house. But, the

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:10.060
girls keep on making fun of him. Evan finally
says that he will call the police, no matter

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:14.120
what. Fearing that he might call the police
for real, they agree to leave. Evan takes

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:17.060
them in his car and leaves them to their destination.

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:21.990
Evan goes back to his house, and starts cleaning
the mess that Bel and Genesis had made. At

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:26.270
night, he sits to work on his project, but
he hears something drop. He sees that a photo

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:31.000
frame had dropped. He bends down to pick it
up, but Genesis hits him from behind and knocks

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.000
him out.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.380
When Evan wakes up, he finds himself tied
up to his bed. He tells Genesis to free him,

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:40.680
but she isn’t listening to him at all. Then,
Bel comes inside and Evan sees her wearing

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:44.660
the school uniform of his daughter. She even
starts calling him “Daddy”.

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:49.160
Bel and Genesis both start taking Evan’s
clothes off. Evan tries to resist with all

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:53.700
his strength. But, just then, he receives
a call from his wife. Fearing that they will

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:58.230
answer the call and show her wife everything,
Evan agrees to do whatever they say.

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:02.830
Bel starts having sex with Evan, while Genesis
starts to record everything with her phone.

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:06.690
When Genesis goes outside to grab something
to eat, Evan uses all his strength to free

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:12.110
himself and gets Bel off of him. He unties
himself and goes outside to attack Genesis.

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:16.820
But she manages to stab him with a fork. Evan
cries out loud with pain, and soon faints

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:17.820
to sleep.

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:22.240
When he wakes up, he again finds himself tied
up to a chair, with a cloth in his mouth.

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:25.951
Bel and Genesis start to play a game with
Evan. Whenever Evan doesn’t answer their

00:07:25.951 --> 00:07:29.190
question, they play loud screeching sounds
in his ears.

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:33.580
Louis gets to his house, to get Karen’s
artworks and ship it for the art gallery.

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:38.480
Bel takes Evan to another room. And Genesis
answers the door. Louis is confused to find

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:42.420
them at Evan’s house, but they tell him
that they are nieces of Evan. Louis goes to

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:46.940
check the artwork and finds them destroyed.
Bel and Genesis tell him that it was maybe

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:51.040
Evan who made the mess out of the artwork.
Louis is furious and doesn’t believe them

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:56.050
one bit. He tells them that he will call the
cops. Genesis tries to seduce him, but he

00:07:56.050 --> 00:08:00.700
isn’t easily seduced like Evan. He shouts
at the girls, and hears a noise. He follows

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:05.260
the sound and finds Evan tied up. He quickly
tries to untie Evan, but he hears that the

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.480
girls are destroying the art piece.

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:11.920
Seeing the art piece get demolished by Bel
and Genesis, Louis gets an asthma attack.

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:15.960
He tries to use his inhaler, but the crazy
girls take it away from him and start playing

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:20.191
catch with it. Louis begs them to give him
his inhaler, but they don’t listen. While

00:08:20.191 --> 00:08:24.580
trying to take his inhaler, Louis slips and
hits his head on the solid concrete. Louis

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:29.430
is dead after this, but Bel and Genesis aren’t
worried at all. In fact, they start laughing

00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:30.430
maniacally.

00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:34.479
Evan asks them to call the ambulance, but
they say it's too late. They start to cover

00:08:34.479 --> 00:08:38.660
Louis’s body and also exchange texts from
the phone of Evan and Louis. They are trying

00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:43.099
to stage a fight between Evan and Louis, to
make it seem like it was Evan who killed him.

00:08:43.099 --> 00:08:46.139
They put Louis’ body in the van and go back
to Evan.

00:08:46.139 --> 00:08:50.040
Evan asks them the reason behind what they
had done. They answer that they were checking

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:54.350
if Evan would cheat on his wife or not. They
were total psychopaths. They believe that

00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:58.100
since Evan cheated on his wife, he didn’t
deserve to stay alive.

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:01.819
Hearing that they are going to kill him, Evan
starts screaming at them. He tells them that

00:09:01.819 --> 00:09:06.449
it was them, who came after him. But Bel and
Genesis don’t budge. They say that Evan

00:09:06.449 --> 00:09:08.160
will be executed at dawn.

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:12.060
They both start digging a hole, possibly to
bury Evan. While they are getting busy with

00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:16.970
the digging, Evan uses his legs to get to
his i-pad. He uses automated voice assistance

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:22.050
to call Karen. The i-pad calls Karen, but
Bel and Genesis are back. Genesis finds the

00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:24.149
i-pad and throws it outside.

00:09:24.149 --> 00:09:29.000
Bel and Genesis then start acting like monsters,
just like how Evan used to with his children.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.209
Evan gets confused and asks them how they
knew about it. But they keep on mocking him.

00:09:33.209 --> 00:09:37.060
Then, Evan knows that they were spying on
him and his family for a long time.

00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:41.529
Bel and Genesis get changed, and start destroying
everything. They destroy all the artworks

00:09:41.529 --> 00:09:45.839
of Karen. They destroy Evan’s house and
even cut his hair. They’re making a complete

00:09:45.839 --> 00:09:49.839
mockery out of Evan. While destroying the
house, they find a gun that Evan had hidden

00:09:49.839 --> 00:09:51.730
in case of emergencies.

00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:55.930
After finding the gun, Genesis says that she
wants to play hide and seek. They untie him

00:09:55.930 --> 00:10:00.360
and tell him that he has 30 seconds to hide.
If Evan gets out of the house, they will shoot

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:05.189
him. But if Evan manages to hide until morning,
Bel and Genesis promise to leave him.

00:10:05.189 --> 00:10:09.589
After this, Evan goes somewhere in his house
to hide. Bel and Genesis start looking for

00:10:09.589 --> 00:10:14.410
him. They look everywhere but fail to find
him. Evan tries to escape from them, but Genesis

00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:19.509
catches him. Evan cries out for help but Genesis
tells him that no one was there to help him.

00:10:19.509 --> 00:10:23.560
The sun finally rises, They take the tied
up body of Evan to the hole they had dug last

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:27.959
night. They put him inside the hole and start
covering it. Soon, they have the entire hole

00:10:27.959 --> 00:10:32.519
covered with only Evan’s head sticking out.
Genesis grabs a stone and it seems she will

00:10:32.519 --> 00:10:37.370
use it to kill Evan. But, she doesn’t smash
it on Evan’s head. Bel and Genesis both

00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:38.750
start laughing loudly.

00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:43.640
Evan, for the final time, begs them to leave
him alone. Then, Bel and Genesis reveal the

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:47.329
truth. They tell him that they were just having
fun with him, and weren’t planning to kill

00:10:47.329 --> 00:10:52.180
him at all. In fact, they were not even underage
girls. They just wanted to seduce a married

00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:56.320
man, and then ruin his family. It was something
that they really enjoyed.

00:10:56.320 --> 00:11:00.639
After telling Evan the truth, Bel shows Evan
a video. It’s the video that Genesis had

00:11:00.639 --> 00:11:05.199
taken, when Bel was wearing Evan’s daughter’s
school uniform, and she was in bed with Evan.

00:11:05.199 --> 00:11:09.529
She even uploads the video on Evan’s facebook
page, and writes a caption on it, “Happy

00:11:09.529 --> 00:11:13.579
Father’s Day”. Bel and Genesis were truly
sick human beings. They leave the phone in

00:11:13.579 --> 00:11:16.279
front of Evan, and leave to look out for a
new victim.

00:11:16.279 --> 00:11:20.769
Evan’s family also return from their trip
and find their house completely ruined.

00:11:20.769 --> 00:11:25.329
At the same time, Evan manages to take his
hands out. He tries to delete the video from

00:11:25.329 --> 00:11:29.910
his facebook account, but he accidentally
ends up liking it. And the movie ends.

00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:34.351
Hope you guys enjoyed the video. If you ever
find yourself in a situation like Evan, please

00:11:34.351 --> 00:11:38.279
try to control yourself, or you might get
yourself in the same condition as Evan.

00:11:38.279 --> 00:11:42.529
That’s it for this video. If you enjoyed
the video, make sure to leave a like, and
