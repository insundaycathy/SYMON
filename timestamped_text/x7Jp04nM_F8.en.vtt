00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.250
Hello Everybody. Hello Everybody. Welcome
to my channel. Today I am going to explain

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.720
an irish horror film caleed Boys from county
hill. The film begins in a small town in Ireland

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:16.449
named Six Miles Hill. Here, framing was the
main business. This town was famous for the

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:21.610
legend of Abhartach. According to the legend,
Brahm Stoker came here in the 19th century

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:26.699
and after listening to the story of Abhartach,
he wrote the novel Dracula. This town had

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.369
a cairn in the fields which has lasted for
centuries and is believed to be the grave

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:36.131
of Abhartach. Locals never touched this cairn
as they believed in its legend too. According

00:00:36.131 --> 00:00:40.730
to the legend, Centuries ago there was a zombie-like
man known as Abhartach who used to suck blood

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:46.871
out of people. He was killed by a town chief
named Cahan. Cahan burried Abhartach's body

00:00:46.871 --> 00:00:52.601
beneath this monument and placed stones over
it. So that he can never reincarnate. People

00:00:52.601 --> 00:00:57.329
had been believing in this legend for centuries
and were still doing it today. After the book

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.770
Dracula got famous in the late 19th century,
this town became famous too. The Cairn became

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:07.310
a tourist place where people from all around
the world used to visit here. Here the local

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:32.100
bar was named after Brahm Stoker.Two youngsters
named Eugene and William were drinking at

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:38.200
the bar. Eugene was unemployed and broke,
he lived alone in his house. William completed

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.810
his degree at the university and was working
at Eugene's dad's construction company. Off-coarse

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:49.800
temporarily. These two guys mutual friend,
Claire, was a bar attendant in this bar. These

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.529
three wanted to settle out of this town as
they believed this town as a shitty town.

00:01:54.529 --> 00:01:59.869
Now two Canadian tourists have just arrived
at this bar who apparently had lots of money.

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:04.310
Seeing the money they have, Eugene takes them
on a tour of Cairn. Narrating the history

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.759
of Cairn, he says, Abhartach was the first
vampire in the world, as soon as someone comes

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.580
near him, blood starts to pour out from them
like water. William says that this cairn has

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.600
been on his Dad's farm for centuries. If someone
places their ears on this cairn, then even

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:24.560
today they will hear the voice of Abartach.
William asks tourists to check it for themselves.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.921
As soon as one guy places his ear on the stone,
a vampire-like hand grabs his head. Which

00:02:29.921 --> 00:02:35.010
naturally spooks him, and he runs away from
there shouting in panic. Now we see Eugene

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:40.200
and William's fourth friend, Sap, emerging
from the cairn. It was all a prank concocted

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:46.230
by these guys to scare the tourists. L O L.
The tourists go away abusing these three in

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:52.230
anger. Later Sap says he wants to see at least
once in his life what lies beneath this cairn.

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.260
To which William says that if the bypass road
project goes through, then this cairn will

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:02.060
have to be demolished. Then we will see what
lies beneath it.Eugene’s dad, Francie, was

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:07.841
a contractor. He had a construction company
called Moffat construction. SP and William

00:03:07.841 --> 00:03:12.480
were road workers there. He was building a
bypass road for which the demolition of this

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:18.040
cairn was necessary. The cairn was in the
middle of the road.Next day we see Eugene

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:23.120
at his house, it is adjacent to his mom’s
farm field. For centuries Eugene’s mom’s

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.720
family were in farming. Eugene’s mom’s
old house was also in the field where he used

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.860
to live when he was a child. Here Eugene’s
and Francie’s relationship was estranged.

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:38.440
Eugene’s mom was dead, and she was divorced.
Francie was not a good dad, he never took

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.690
care of his young son properly, hence there
was a resentment in Eugene’s heart towards

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:48.560
Francie. Eugene got his mom's house as an
inheritance.Francie now offers a job to Eugene

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.319
at his company. He was hoping he could use
him and William to pursue William’s dad

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:57.819
George, who was against the demolition of
that cairn. We see Eugene entering a huge

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:02.720
underground barn in front of his house, which
was there for centuries in different forms.

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.090
Their we see an opening which used to connect
to the town’s swear lines. Eugene finds

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:26.940
a human skull there which seemed old and half
of 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:31.720
its were missing. Later we see William and
Eugene at the same bar, William was planning

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.730
to shift to Australia. He had an offer from
an Australian company who was willing to pay

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:41.900
more. In the meanwhile, Claire lost her job
too, she was joining these boys tomorrow morning

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:48.031
on the road work project. As William was wasted
with drinks, hence Eugene picked him up. He

00:04:48.031 --> 00:04:52.920
starts to drop him to his house. On the way
these two start to argue and fight over Claire

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:57.790
as both were in love with her. Eugene wanted
William to propose to her, otherwise he was

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:01.870
going to do that. These two were fighting
near the cairn where William’s hand hit

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:07.610
a sharp-edged stone. He starts bleeding.At
this precise time both hear George’s screaming

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:12.551
voice as one of his bulls was raging towards
him. The bull directly attacks William, it

00:05:12.551 --> 00:05:17.290
pokes his horn into him, which results in
his death on the spot. Gorge arrives and drives

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:22.600
it away from William, but it was late. Eugene
observes a strange phenomenon here, all the

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.710
blood coming from Eugene’s body was sinking
in the mud as if someone was sucking it from

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:32.710
beneath.Next day police investigate this matter,
William’s funeral takes place. The town’s

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:36.820
people were blaming Eugene for William’s
death, they were unhappy about the road project

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:42.330
as it was going to demolish that cairn. Where
Eugene was a part of it. Later Eugene Claire

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:48.730
and Sp start their routine work. After a few
weeks the project arrives at the cairn location.

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:52.720
George was still not ready to move on from
his house or agree to demolish that cairn

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:57.630
which was directly obstructing the road project.
He insists on Eugene not to demolish that

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:02.860
cairn as he thought it could make the evil
alive again.He warns him. He asks him in a

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:07.900
cryptic way about William’s blood when he
died, to which Eugene gives no answer. As

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:13.310
he was feeling guilty.Eugene now orders his
co-worker Gabriel to demolish that cairn,

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:19.550
but like many in town, he was scared too.
He refuses it. Hence, Eugene himself demolishes

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:24.250
that cairn. At night we see Eugene and Claire
who were getting close, Claire started to

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:29.310
like Eugene. At the construction site we see
Charlie, the night guard, someone knocks at

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:35.160
his cabin. When Charlie opened the door, there
was nobody. He shouts angrily in the air as

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:40.840
he was pissed. As soon as he returns to his
cabin, we see his blood splashing on the window.

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:45.620
Meaning someone has just killed him.Next day
Francie makes Eugene the in-charge for the

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:50.380
day as he was leaving the town for some odd
work. Later Eugene and others see that someone

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:56.200
has rebuilt the cairn. Charlie was missing
too. Eugene gets confused, he goes back to

00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:01.010
the drawing board and makes a new way so that
the cairn could be saved. When Francie arrives

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:06.620
in the evening and sees that no work was done,
then he angrily shuts at Eugene. He rejects

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:12.520
Eugene’s new proposal saying he was no engineer.
He orders him to demolish that cairn again.Now

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:17.270
we see Charlie at the cabin who was looking
sick. Eugene was taking him to the hospital

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:22.340
in a van, then the sunset happens. Charlie
converts and becomes a vampire, he attacks

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:28.130
Eugene which causes an accident. Francie,
Claire, SP and Gabriel help Eugene, then all

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:33.360
the head lights at the site go off. Eugene
explains about the vampire-like behavior of

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:37.699
Charlie, but nobody heeds it. Francie now
goes to switch on the lights where someone

00:07:37.699 --> 00:07:42.550
kidnaps Gabriel. Eugene was searching for
Charlie at the cabin where Charlie attacked

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:47.260
him violently. Claire arrives there in time,
and she starts to beat Charlie with a measuring

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:52.280
rod. She pokes the nose of the rod into Charlie's
heart, which causes his heart to move out

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:57.169
from his body. Eugene and Claire ran from
there in panic where SP and Francie found

00:07:57.169 --> 00:08:02.530
Gabriel’s body. He was dead too. These guys
were in chaos as they didn’t know what the

00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:07.220
hell was happening.Now Charlie came from that
cabin with that pole on his chest, and his

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:13.070
heart was out. He had become an undead zombie
as Abartech. Francie grabs him by his pole

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:18.699
and drops him into a hole. He beats him, but
he doesn't die. Charlie climbs the pole and

00:08:18.699 --> 00:08:23.621
starts coming out of it. Claire pours a ton
of mud on him with the help of a JCB, but

00:08:23.621 --> 00:08:29.350
that also doesn't help.He starts to get out
of the mud. Eugene asks Claire to pour stones

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:34.570
on him from a nearby cairn as a last resort.
Claire does that, and this time Charlie was

00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:39.390
buried. Meaning, he was converted into a zombie,
and you could only finish them by burying

00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:44.810
them with stones like cairn.All four breathe
a sigh of relief for a few minutes. They were

00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:49.270
now convinced in the legend of Abhartech.
This has been happening since yesterday when

00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:54.230
Eugene demolished the cairn. These guys see
some movement from the original cairn, the

00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:58.660
hand of the original Abhartech comes out of
it. As Claire had demolished the original

00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:03.680
cairn to pour stones on the charlie. Seeing
this these four runs away from it like Usain

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:10.250
Bolt. All these scenes were very funny. The
director has done a brilliant job here. Now

00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:15.170
they arrive at George's house and explain
everything to him. George was not surprised

00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:21.230
here. He gives the idea of informing the police.
Eugene tries that but fails to explain it

00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:26.580
properly. Later George shows the truth to
all. He had locked William in a room, he too

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:31.770
had become a zombie like Charlie. He was quite
violent, George was feeding him animals every

00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:38.150
day. George was a mortician, he was preparing
William's body at home. That day, William

00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:42.630
got up as soon as the night fell, it was also
seen by George's wife Pauline, and since then

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:47.700
she was in shock. A small piece of stone was
stuck on William's hand when he fought with

00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:52.481
Eugene. George says that people do not convert
into zombies by the bite of a vampire, but

00:09:52.481 --> 00:09:58.670
become zombies with the cut of Abartech stones.
George had a fake body at William's funeral.He

00:09:58.670 --> 00:10:02.971
also confesses that he attacked Charlie in
the cabin. It was he who made him a zombie

00:10:02.971 --> 00:10:07.520
by scratching him with the stone of Abartech.
George's farm house was in the middle of this

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:12.820
road project, he was trying to stop it at
any cost. That's why he made Charlie a zombie

00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:17.350
so that he could attack everyone, which may
lead to the halting of the project. By saying

00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:23.040
all this, George started crying. As for him,
William was still alive. He thought of his

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:28.589
zombieness as a medical condition that could
be cured. He didn't want to lose his son.

00:10:28.589 --> 00:10:33.570
These four were shocked after hearing this,
they did not even expect this in their dreams.

00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:37.890
Eugene consoles George and says, what is there
in that room is no William, William is gone,

00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:43.680
this zombie is just a curse. These four now
pacify George and convince him. Their plan

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:48.830
was now to hit William hard so that he became
unconscious and put stones on his body. As

00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:53.980
this idea was written in the novel Dracula.
Here Francie disagrees with it, he suggests

00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:58.690
a dark creative idea of severing the head
of William. So that he will be weak and easy

00:10:58.690 --> 00:11:03.980
to put him in a coffin. For this, they prepare
a coffin with extra boards.

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:10.110
George was ready with an axe. Eugene goes
to William's room, opens his lock and runs

00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:14.610
back. William follows him, but he does not
come forward as he has understood their trick.

00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:18.930
There were memories left in him. Claire now
grabs Eugenie's hand and provokes William

00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:24.560
as she knew William liked her. William proceeds
forward with anger. George was about to hit

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:29.430
his head with an axe, that's when Pauline
shot him from behind. She was awake, and she

00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:34.210
sensed William as her son. She goes towards
him in her innocence, but zombie William attacks

00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:40.850
her and kills her. Oh, Poor Lady. The rest
runs away from home seeing their failed plan.

00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:45.800
In a hurry, Eugene forgot to bring the car
keys. William now comes out, George shoots

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:51.190
at him for distraction, but it's no use. He
doesn't die. George didn't want to die from

00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:56.390
a zombie bite, so he shot himself with the
gun. William attacks him anyway and eats him

00:11:56.390 --> 00:12:01.870
alive. We see the town's police officer here
who was sleeping in his house. When he wakes

00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:06.920
up for the leak, he starts bleeding heavily.
As the original Abhartech was now risen from

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:11.860
his graveyard, he was moving around the town
and sucking people's blood.The rest went back

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:18.080
home and were hiding. SP and Eugene were hiding
under the casket in the funeral room. Claire

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:22.990
and Francie were hiding in the hall. When
William was checking one casket, Eugene hammers

00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:28.399
a nail in his head, SP pushes him in an empty
casket and shouts for help. William attacks

00:12:28.399 --> 00:12:33.990
back, he snatches Sp's stomach, due to which
he starts bleeding. Later, Claire, Eugene

00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:39.320
and Francie attacked William and put him in
a casket. They closed it with many nails.But

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:44.779
in the midst of all this, SP was hurt pretty
bad, he dies due to excessive bleeding. Eugene

00:12:44.779 --> 00:12:48.920
and Claire were crying as they lost two of
their childhood friends in two months. But

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:54.230
the work was not over yet, they buried that
casket next to George's house. They pour stones

00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:59.160
on it. Now the original Abhartech who came
out of that cairn was roaming in the town,

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:03.350
he was sucking blood from all the people.
Here we see that old couple which we saw at

00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:09.100
the beginning. It was he who was at their
door step. The bar owner, tourists, police,

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:13.470
the common people started bleeding, blood
was flowing from their bodies into the swear

00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:17.350
lines. Francie, Eugene and Claire now visit
Claire's house. Where Claire's mother was

00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:21.890
bleeding while sleeping. These three were
away from Abhartech, hence they were not bleeding.

00:13:21.890 --> 00:13:26.540
Eugene now feels that Abharatech may be heading
for that opening in his shed.That's the opening

00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:32.330
where he found the skull and many more bones.
As it was connected to swear lines. He thinks

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:37.370
that initially the blood is flowing, later
bodies may flow too.Francie and Eugene now

00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:43.270
visit their old house. Francie also starts
bleeding as soon as he arrives there. Meaning,

00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:49.110
Abhartach was nearby. But strengly Eugene
was not bleeding. Francie observes an old

00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:54.149
portrait hanging there and says that his Eugene's
mother was a descendant of Chahan. The town's

00:13:54.149 --> 00:13:59.560
chief who buried the original Abhartach. Francie
concludes that Eugene might be having Chahan's

00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:04.370
blood, hence he was not bleeding. In this
terrible situation Eugene and Francie come

00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:10.410
closer. Suddenly, Abhartech arrives at this
and starts attacking them. Francie locks Eugene

00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:15.810
in a room and hits Abhartech with a rod. Abhartech
attacks back, he breaks Francie's leg with

00:14:15.810 --> 00:14:21.779
an axe. Eugene excapes from his room, he repeatedly
hits Abharatach and makes him unconscious.

00:14:21.779 --> 00:14:27.180
Next he runs away with Francie. They both
ran away to the same underground shed where

00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:31.390
they found the skull. It was almost morning,
according to Dracula's novel, the vampires

00:14:31.390 --> 00:14:38.209
burn in the day light. But nothing like that
happens here. That thing was purely a friction.

00:14:38.209 --> 00:14:42.950
Francie and Eugenie were now trapped, they
could not run anywhere. Francie asks Eugene

00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:47.420
to uproot to uproot his leg and use it to
attack Abhartech. Eugene does not agree at

00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:52.550
first but finally does it. He beats the crap
out of Abhartech with human legs and pores

00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:58.899
the stones on him. By burying under the stone,
Abhartech finally dies. Eugene braces Francie's

00:14:58.899 --> 00:15:03.940
leg tightly and stops his bleeding. As soon
as Abhartech dies, the rest of the people

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:08.690
of the town come to their senses, most of
them were unconscious due to bloodshed.The

00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:14.330
story now moves forward three months. Claire
was now headed to Australia. Eugene tells

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:19.440
her a good bye. Francie was now living with
Eugenie, both of them had renovated the house

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:24.940
together. Abhartech's grave was still in the
underground shed in front of his house. So

00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:30.820
this was the story of the film Boys from Country
Hell. This film is a horror film as well as

00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:36.320
a comedy film. The gore scenes of the film
are quite good. The director has explored

00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:42.110
the local Irish folklore well. The film is
full of human relations, like George and William.

00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:47.310
A perfect father-son relationship who loved
each other very much. Whereas Eugenie and

00:15:47.310 --> 00:15:53.010
Francie were just the opposite. The film also
focuses on the importance of friendship. I

00:15:53.010 --> 00:15:58.150
really liked this one. I hope you do too.
