00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:41.810 align:start position:0%
good time like what's like like it's all

00:29:41.810 --> 00:29:41.820 align:start position:0%
of that friction at once and like you
 

00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:44.980 align:start position:0%
of that friction at once and like you
say<00:29:42.000><c> uneasy</c><00:29:42.330><c> and</c><00:29:42.960><c> I</c><00:29:43.080><c> think</c><00:29:43.350><c> that</c><00:29:43.679><c> is</c>

00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:44.990 align:start position:0%
say uneasy and I think that is
 

00:29:44.990 --> 00:29:48.139 align:start position:0%
say uneasy and I think that is
absolutely<00:29:45.990><c> the</c><00:29:46.110><c> right</c><00:29:46.380><c> approach</c><00:29:46.860><c> because</c><00:29:47.549><c> I</c>

00:29:48.139 --> 00:29:48.149 align:start position:0%
absolutely the right approach because I
 

00:29:48.149 --> 00:29:50.840 align:start position:0%
absolutely the right approach because I
think<00:29:48.330><c> storytelling</c><00:29:48.870><c> should</c><00:29:49.799><c> be</c><00:29:50.010><c> uneasy</c><00:29:50.370><c> and</c>

00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:50.850 align:start position:0%
think storytelling should be uneasy and
 

00:29:50.850 --> 00:29:53.029 align:start position:0%
think storytelling should be uneasy and

00:29:58.130 --> 00:29:58.140 align:start position:0%
I'm making me feel uneasy and cranking
 

00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:01.389 align:start position:0%
I'm making me feel uneasy and cranking
up<00:29:58.260><c> the</c><00:29:58.289><c> tension</c><00:29:58.799><c> and</c><00:29:59.070><c> whatever</c><00:29:59.669><c> but</c><00:30:00.090><c> because</c>

00:30:01.389 --> 00:30:01.399 align:start position:0%
up the tension and whatever but because
 

00:30:01.399 --> 00:30:03.799 align:start position:0%
up the tension and whatever but because
because<00:30:02.399><c> it's</c><00:30:02.549><c> the</c><00:30:02.610><c> way</c><00:30:02.850><c> the</c><00:30:03.270><c> story</c><00:30:03.570><c> behind</c>

00:30:03.799 --> 00:30:03.809 align:start position:0%
because it's the way the story behind
 

00:30:03.809 --> 00:30:06.639 align:start position:0%
because it's the way the story behind
the<00:30:04.140><c> room</c><00:30:04.350><c> and</c><00:30:04.559><c> because</c><00:30:04.649><c> it's</c><00:30:04.919><c> essentially</c>

00:30:06.639 --> 00:30:06.649 align:start position:0%
the room and because it's essentially
 

00:30:06.649 --> 00:30:09.139 align:start position:0%
the room and because it's essentially
one<00:30:07.649><c> of</c><00:30:07.679><c> these</c><00:30:07.950><c> different</c><00:30:08.340><c> types</c><00:30:08.520><c> of</c><00:30:08.730><c> idiocy</c>

00:30:09.139 --> 00:30:09.149 align:start position:0%
one of these different types of idiocy
 

00:30:09.149 --> 00:30:11.060 align:start position:0%
one of these different types of idiocy
so<00:30:09.690><c> I'm</c><00:30:09.840><c> rubbing</c><00:30:10.200><c> up</c><00:30:10.320><c> against</c><00:30:10.710><c> each</c><00:30:10.799><c> other</c>

00:30:11.060 --> 00:30:11.070 align:start position:0%
so I'm rubbing up against each other
 

00:30:11.070 --> 00:30:13.340 align:start position:0%
so I'm rubbing up against each other
creating<00:30:11.580><c> a</c><00:30:11.669><c> really</c><00:30:11.940><c> unique</c><00:30:12.179><c> kind</c><00:30:12.539><c> of</c><00:30:12.870><c> tension</c>

00:30:13.340 --> 00:30:13.350 align:start position:0%
creating a really unique kind of tension
 

00:30:13.350 --> 00:30:15.740 align:start position:0%
creating a really unique kind of tension
that<00:30:13.380><c> you</c><00:30:13.679><c> just</c><00:30:13.890><c> I</c><00:30:14.070><c> don't</c><00:30:14.240><c> think</c><00:30:15.240><c> you</c><00:30:15.450><c> getting</c>

00:30:15.740 --> 00:30:15.750 align:start position:0%
that you just I don't think you getting
 

00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:17.930 align:start position:0%
that you just I don't think you getting
any<00:30:16.140><c> other</c><00:30:16.380><c> filming</c><00:30:16.860><c> on</c><00:30:17.010><c> purpose</c><00:30:17.669><c> or</c><00:30:17.909><c> by</c>

00:30:17.930 --> 00:30:17.940 align:start position:0%
any other filming on purpose or by
 

00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:21.799 align:start position:0%
any other filming on purpose or by

00:30:21.799 --> 00:30:21.809 align:start position:0%
accident yeah and that tension it
 

00:30:21.809 --> 00:30:23.360 align:start position:0%
accident yeah and that tension it
doesn't<00:30:22.260><c> provide</c><00:30:22.409><c> the</c><00:30:22.470><c> story</c><00:30:22.919><c> cuz</c><00:30:23.279><c> the</c>

00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:23.370 align:start position:0%
doesn't provide the story cuz the

doesn't provide the story cuz the

00:30:25.220 --> 00:30:25.230 align:start position:0%
story's pointless but it's part of
 

00:30:25.230 --> 00:30:27.380 align:start position:0%

00:30:39.649 --> 00:30:39.659 align:start position:0%
to get had it and it's like that
 

00:30:39.659 --> 00:30:41.299 align:start position:0%
to get had it and it's like that
friction<00:30:40.080><c> is</c><00:30:40.169><c> create</c><00:30:40.470><c> a</c><00:30:40.500><c> very</c><00:30:40.860><c> different</c><00:30:41.220><c> way</c>

00:30:41.299 --> 00:30:41.309 align:start position:0%
