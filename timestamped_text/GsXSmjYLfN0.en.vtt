00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:06.880
Welcome back to Movie Recaps. Today I will show&nbsp;
you a thriller film from 2015, titled The BFG.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.400
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.
Our story begins late at night in an orphanage&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.800
in London. The matron comes to the front door to&nbsp;
lock it up, but she gets distracted by a magazine&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.720
that was slipped under the door with the mail.&nbsp;
She grabs the magazine and leaves without taking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.560
care of the door, which frustrates the little&nbsp;
girl hiding under a blanket on the stairs:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.040
that's Sophie, our ten-year-old protagonist.&nbsp;
Wearing the blanket around her shoulders, she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.120
goes to the door and locks it up herself before&nbsp;
moving to the pendulum clock nearby and pushing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.520
the hand to make it 3am. While she picks up the&nbsp;
mail and turns off the lights, she tells us that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.960
unlike other people who choose 00am or 1am, Sophie&nbsp;
thinks 3am is the witching hour, the time when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.760
only she is left awake. She goes to the matron's&nbsp;
desk and puts the mail on the corresponding tray,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.560
only to get distracted by some noises coming&nbsp;
from outside. She goes to the window, opens it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:57.040
and looks out to find four drunk men causing&nbsp;
a ruckus. Sophie scolds them, reminding them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.040
there are children sleeping, and threatens them&nbsp;
with calling the cops if they don't cut it out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.280
As she turns off the street light and closes the&nbsp;
window, the men decide not to risk it and leave.&nbsp;

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.840
A strange moving shadow is seen on the window as&nbsp;
Sophie leaves it behind to go back to the room&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.480
she shares with other orphans. Once she's back&nbsp;
in bed, she covers herself with her blanket,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.000
puts on her glasses and turns on a&nbsp;
flashlight to continue reading her book.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.080
When the matron comes by to check on the kids, she&nbsp;
turns off the light and hides under the covers,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.000
only to turn it on again as soon as the&nbsp;
matron is gone. Not much reading is achieved&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.520
afterward because Sophie soon hears a&nbsp;
noise outside and decides to check it out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.760
She slowly approaches the windows as she&nbsp;
repeats the rules: never get out of bed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.920
never go to the window, and never look behind&nbsp;
the curtain. She breaks all three and goes to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.040
the balcony, where she sees it was a bunch of cats&nbsp;
that made the noise - or so she thinks. Suddenly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.440
a giant hand appears around a house and picks&nbsp;
up the trashcan the cats pushed off. The hand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.600
is quickly followed by a big face and a huge body&nbsp;
belonging to a giant man that is shocked to find&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.000
out he's been seen by Sophie. She runs back to her&nbsp;
bed to hide under the blanket when she sees him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.160
run towards her, but this isn't enough to stop the&nbsp;
giant: he just sticks his hand through the window&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.880
and picks her up, blanket and book included.
The giant starts running through London then. Her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.040
blanket has been folded into something like a bag&nbsp;
so she can be carried, and from her spot there,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:12.960
Sophie can see how the giant pulls different&nbsp;
tricks go unnoticed in the city, like pretending&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.680
to be a wall, covering the street lights,&nbsp;
pretending to be cargo on a truck or even a tree.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.520
Once they make it out of London, the giant&nbsp;
continues to get away by taking big leaps&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.880
through the countryside and then the sea until&nbsp;
they reach a thick accumulation of clouds.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.840
The giant easily crosses it before running through&nbsp;
a new area filled with random human objects and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.720
rocky formations, he doesn't stop until they enter&nbsp;
a furnished cave: this is his home. He hangs the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.400
blanket with Sophie on a tree branch then goes&nbsp;
to his table to chop a weird-looking vegetable.&nbsp;

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.200
Sophie takes the opportunity to escape by climbing&nbsp;
out of the blanket and onto the tree she's been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.000
left at. By following its branches, she makes it&nbsp;
to the window, which she manages to open after&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.880
having to push very hard. She accidentally ends&nbsp;
up pushing some objects to the floor too though,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.960
gaining the giant's attention. He comes closer&nbsp;
and tells her there's nowhere to go if she doesn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:01.360
have wings, then he pushes the window which in&nbsp;
turn pushes Sophie onto the pan he's holding.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.120
He goes back to the table and after leaving the&nbsp;
pan on it, he keeps on chopping the vegetable.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.080
Sophie asks him where they are, he replies it's&nbsp;
Giant Country, which Sophie points out doesn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:15.120
exist. Suddenly, a nose from outside freaks&nbsp;
her out. The giant looks through the window&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.880
and confirms it's the other giants, who all&nbsp;
have names like Childchewer and Maidmasher.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.280
Scared, Sophie begs him not to eat her, but&nbsp;
the giant laughs at the idea of him eating&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.160
humans - his way of talking's got grammar mistakes&nbsp;
and weird sounding words. When Sophie reminds him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.240
he's snatched her, he admits that's true and that&nbsp;
he can't help thinking about her parents, but she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:36.000
points out she's an orphan and hated living in&nbsp;
the orphanage, where they had lots of rules and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.480
punishment. The giant insults the matron for it,&nbsp;
as he gives Sophie back her glasses and she asks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.040
him if the other giants are also nice. He replies&nbsp;
while filling his bowl with weird vegetable stew&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.760
that no, the other giants do eat humans and also&nbsp;
consider the nice giant a runt. Sophie doesn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.680
understand why she's been brought here then, the&nbsp;
giant explains he did it because he can't have her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.000
telling everyone about giants, that would cause&nbsp;
the humans to come and lock them up like animals.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.320
No matter how much Sophie swears she won't tell&nbsp;
and asks to be taken back, the giant refuses and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:06.960
tells her she'll stay there for the rest of their&nbsp;
lives. After finishing his stew, which he doesn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:11.360
like, the giant covers Sophie with her blanket to&nbsp;
shut her up, but she says she'll run away anyway.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.760
The giant picks her up and scolds her for it,&nbsp;
reminding her that running away would equal being&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.680
caught by the man-eating giants, then he takes&nbsp;
her to his ship bed and puts her inside the crow's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.240
nest, where she snaps and corrects the words&nbsp;
he's saying wrong. The giant is hurt by this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:29.360
saying he can't help the way he speaks, so Sophie&nbsp;
apologizes. She watches him pick up his bag and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.000
take out a glowing jar, he explains there are&nbsp;
dreams inside. When she mentions she doesn't dream&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.960
because she has insomnia, he picks up her book and&nbsp;
starts reading it to her, making her falls asleep.&nbsp;

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:43.200
Now she can't see him anymore, the giant grabs&nbsp;
his bag and goes to the back of the cave,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.320
where he pulls a lever that opens&nbsp;
a hidden door behind a waterfall.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.000
Behind the door there's his lab, filled&nbsp;
with thousands of jars with dreams.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000
The giant sits at his desk and starts mixing&nbsp;
dream ingredients to make a nightmare for Sophie.&nbsp;

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:59.520
A few hours later, Sophie wakes up and sees the&nbsp;
giant sleeping on the ship bed. She decides to use&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.440
this chance to escape: she pushes the rocking&nbsp;
ship mast through the window and jumps off,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:08.320
making it outside. She doesn't go very far&nbsp;
though, when a giant wakes up and snatches her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:12.640
The gentle giant sees this but ignores her pleads&nbsp;
of help, so Sophie is eaten by the bad giant.&nbsp;

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.560
This turns out to be the nightmare the&nbsp;
giant made for her, Sophie discovers as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:20.160
she wakes up for real in the morning. As&nbsp;
he takes her from the bed to the table,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.800
the giant explains he did what he had to do to&nbsp;
keep her safe. He sits down to have breakfast,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:29.200
and Sophie notices a bottle with a liquid that&nbsp;
fizzes down instead of up. The giant tells him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:33.920
it's frobscottle, the only thing giants drink, and&nbsp;
takes a sip, which causes him to pass some gas.&nbsp;

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:38.880
They're suddenly interrupted by the leader of&nbsp;
the man-eating giants, Fleshlumpeater, who wants&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:43.120
the gentle giant to heal his "boo-boo". While&nbsp;
Sophie hides behind the objects on the table,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.600
the gentle giant tells him they can do it later,&nbsp;
but Fleshlumpeater demands it happen right now.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:51.120
The gentle giant grabs a bucket of&nbsp;
water, which scares Fleshlumpeater,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:55.440
and some cloth that he uses to start taking&nbsp;
care of the wound. While he's busy with that,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:59.120
Fleshlumpeater sniffs the air and asks&nbsp;
the giant if he's acquired a new human,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:03.680
because he can smell one. The giant denies it&nbsp;
as Sophie hides inside the weird vegetable,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.440
a snozzcumber, but Fleshlumpeater&nbsp;
says he's hungry and keeps searching.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:12.240
He finds the snozzcumber and the giant encourages&nbsp;
him to eat it as a distraction. Fleshlumpeater is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:16.320
about to bite it when the giant notices Sophie is&nbsp;
hiding inside, so he stops him by reminding him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:21.040
he hates vegetables. This makes Fleshlumpeater&nbsp;
drop the snozzcumber, so he grabs the bottle of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:25.200
frobscottle instead and leaves after telling the&nbsp;
gentle giant that he's an insult to giant people.&nbsp;

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:30.560
The giant puts the snozzcumber back on the table,&nbsp;
allowing Sophie to come out all dirty. He offers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:35.360
her his hand to ride, which she climbs after some&nbsp;
hesitation. She's taken to the dream lab, where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:39.520
the giant has a water tank that he opens for her&nbsp;
to wash, then she's put in front of the boiler,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:44.480
which she finds too hot. After putting her on the&nbsp;
table, the giant gives her a box of human clothes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:48.480
so she changes under a sheet while the giant puts&nbsp;
her things in a hole on the tree for her to sleep&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:53.360
in. When he turns around, Sophie is wearing a&nbsp;
dress and a jacket that makes him look gloomy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:56.640
He picks her up and takes her to the tree&nbsp;
hole since he needs to leave for work,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:00.960
when Sophie asks what his job is, the giant says&nbsp;
it's a secret, but admits it's about catching&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:05.360
dreams when Sophie points out she can't tell&nbsp;
anybody. Sophie wants to go with him but the giant&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:10.160
refuses. She tries asking again after turning&nbsp;
around her jacket and coming out of the tree,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.200
begging and pleading over and over&nbsp;
until the giant gives in and accepts.&nbsp;

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:17.360
With Sophie riding his shoulder, the giant&nbsp;
leaves the cave and shows her how the other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:21.520
giants sleep on the field during the day. He&nbsp;
carefully and silently sneaks around them to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:25.200
make it through the cliff, but Fleshlumpeater&nbsp;
suddenly wakes up and catches him by his leg.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:30.160
Sophie falls and runs to hide in a nearby car,&nbsp;
dropping her blanket behind her, while the bad&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:34.880
giants throw the gentle giant around as if he&nbsp;
was a football. They get an idea for a game then:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:38.800
the giant that has Sophie's friend grabs a car&nbsp;
and takes them to one side of the hill, another&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:43.600
giant picks up two other cars, including the one&nbsp;
that has Sophie, and takes them to the other side.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:47.840
The gentle friend is put on top of the car and&nbsp;
pushed downhill while at the same time, the other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:52.560
giant comes down from the other side standing on&nbsp;
both cars. Seeing as crashing is imminent, Sophie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:56.880
grabs the steering wheel and pushes until she&nbsp;
manages to turn the car, making the giant open his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:01.520
legs and hit his crotch against the gentle friend.&nbsp;
The giants find all this very amusing, and they're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:06.000
ready to do more bullying when suddenly it starts&nbsp;
raining. Since they're all afraid of water, they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.960
run to find cover while the gentle giant picks up&nbsp;
Sophie and her glasses and gets away. Meanwhile,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:14.880
the bad giants find Sophie's blanket and sniff&nbsp;
it: they're sure there's a human around now.&nbsp;

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:19.840
After a long walk, the giant crosses another&nbsp;
thick accumulation of clouds and they make it to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:24.640
Dream Country, where is already nighttime. The&nbsp;
giant tells Sophie he can hear what the stars,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:28.560
animals and trees say to each other before&nbsp;
putting her down on the ground. She walks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:32.400
towards a lake that reflects a giant tree with&nbsp;
lights that don't appear on the actual tree.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:36.560
The giant admits then that he used to be called&nbsp;
Big Friendly Giant before jumping into the lake,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:40.560
Sophie follows him and lands on the reflected&nbsp;
land, which is the place where the giant catches&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:44.640
all the dreams that are poured out from the tree's&nbsp;
leaves. There's a particularly energetic dream&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:49.120
that the giant has trouble catching, so Sophie&nbsp;
guides him through it. He manages to catch it when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:54.000
it's approaching the girl and, after putting it&nbsp;
in a jar, the dream draws Sophie's face. The giant&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.800
encourages Sophie to chase some dreams, which she&nbsp;
does after a moment of hesitation. After running&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:02.880
after some different lights, she catches a red&nbsp;
one, which makes the giant quickly take it away&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:07.040
from her hands and lock it in a jar for being a&nbsp;
nightmare. He explains that it says "look at what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:11.600
you has done and there be no forgiveness". The&nbsp;
giant suddenly disappears then, so Sophie calls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:15.840
out for him, worried. But it turns out he's just&nbsp;
left the lake, and he's now pulling her out as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:20.880
well. As they make their way back, Sophie decides&nbsp;
she'll shorten his name and start calling him BFG.&nbsp;

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:26.320
A few hours later, they arrive at London, where&nbsp;
BFG uses his dream-trumpet to spread dreams&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:30.960
among sleeping children. While working, he tells&nbsp;
Sophie he's as old as Earth itself and that he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:35.920
can hear children's hearts, including hers. After&nbsp;
watching a kid dream about the American president,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:39.760
they leave London, but suddenly have to stop&nbsp;
and hide when they hear the man-eating giants&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:44.320
return from the city as well - they had been&nbsp;
snatching and eating humans. After they're gone,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:49.920
BFG asks Sophie about her blanket, and she says&nbsp;
she left it on Giant Country, which worries BFG.&nbsp;

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:54.240
We suddenly cut to a sleeping Sophie, who wakes&nbsp;
up in front of the orphanage. She thinks she's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:58.880
dreaming, but she isn't: BFG appears at the end of&nbsp;
the street and explains the other giants will know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:03.520
about her because she dropped her blanket, so he&nbsp;
must leave her there. Sophie won't accept it, so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:08.000
BFG tells her about a boy that used to live with&nbsp;
him and he couldn't save from the giants' hunger.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.360
This doesn't scare Sophie, but BFG leaves anyway.
Sophie goes back to her bed in the orphanage and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:17.440
remembers BFG told her he can hear everything,&nbsp;
so she goes out to the balcony and jumps,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:22.000
knowing he's still around. She's correct,&nbsp;
BFG saves her before she reaches the ground&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.320
and decides to take her with him. Fleshlumpeater&nbsp;
sees them when they make it back to Giant Country.&nbsp;

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:30.800
Once inside the dream lab, they're trying to&nbsp;
think of a plan when suddenly the bad giants&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:34.800
barge in and start destroying everything as they&nbsp;
hunt for Sophie, who is hiding in her tree hole.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:39.440
The giants' noses take them to her spot though, so&nbsp;
she must leave the tree and sneak around the lab&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:44.480
to escape them. After a failed attempt at entering&nbsp;
BFG's bag, she enters a different tree hole,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:48.800
where she finds the previous boy's room filled&nbsp;
with furniture and drawings. Fleshlumpeater is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:53.600
about to find her there, so BFG finally gains&nbsp;
some bravery and starts driving the giants off,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:56.960
first hitting them with a hot iron and afterward&nbsp;
threatening them with a bucket of water.&nbsp;

00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:01.920
Meanwhile, Sophie finds a portrait of the Queen&nbsp;
in the tree hole, and that gives her an idea.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:05.200
She goes out and after telling BFG&nbsp;
she thinks he speaks beautifully,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:08.960
she tells him she has a plan: they'll&nbsp;
go ask the Queen for help. For this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:13.360
they're going to need a very special nightmare,&nbsp;
so they move to BFG's desk to prepare it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:18.000
They mix the sparks of kids, giants eating&nbsp;
children, the army, Sophie and the BFG with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.320
a nightmare and put it in a jar, the plan is to&nbsp;
make the Queen dream this to scare her, and she'll&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:27.600
wake up to see Sophie and BFG at her window.&nbsp;
BFG refuses to be seen by more people though.&nbsp;

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:32.000
We cut then to Buckingham Palace, where we see&nbsp;
Sophie's managed to convince BFG to come anyway.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:36.800
After sneaking around the soldiers, they make&nbsp;
it to the Queen's window, where BFG blows the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:41.280
nightmare into the Queen's mind. When morning&nbsp;
arrives, the Queen wakes up quite distressed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:45.920
and she speaks of her horrible dream to her staff,&nbsp;
Mary and Mr. Tibbs, who have arrived to bring her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:51.040
breakfast. As the Queen describes the men-eating&nbsp;
giants, Mary opens the newspaper and sees children&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:55.680
have been disappearing, which matches the Queen's&nbsp;
dream. Getting suspicious, the Queen asks Mary&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:59.680
to draw the curtains, which allows them to&nbsp;
find Sophie standing on the windowsill. She&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:04.240
mentions her giant friend brought her there, which&nbsp;
makes Mr. Tibbs call the soldiers to the garden.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:08.480
The Queen realizes everything she's seen in her&nbsp;
dream is true and asks Sophie to introduce them to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:13.680
her friend. Sophie calls BFG out after the Queen&nbsp;
promises she won't hurt him, but he is scared so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:18.000
he doesn't come out until Sophie asks him to be&nbsp;
brave. The soldiers surround him when steps into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.480
the garden but the Queen is true to her word and&nbsp;
makes Mr. Tibbs tell the soldiers to stand back.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:27.040
BFG approaches the window and bows for the Queen,&nbsp;
telling her they've come to bring her assistance.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:32.640
The Queen accepts, but first, she must change.
Moments later, while the Queen calls her ministers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:37.200
and army leaders, Sophie is given better clothes&nbsp;
and a makeover before they leave for breakfast.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:41.920
BFG enters the palace on all fours and joins them&nbsp;
in the dining room, where a special giant table&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:46.560
has been prepared for him. A colossal amount of&nbsp;
food is brought to them then, and when BFG tries&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:50.960
it for the first time, he's delighted by the taste&nbsp;
and decides he won't have snozzcumbers ever again.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:56.080
He dislikes the coffee though, and spits out all&nbsp;
over some of the butlers. He thinks a better drink&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:56.080 --> 00:13:00.480
is needed, so he takes out a bottle of frobscottle&nbsp;
from his bag and gifts it to the Queen.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:04.880
The army leaders arrive then, and the Queen orders&nbsp;
them to defeat the bad giants at Giant Country,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:09.680
which they'll reach by following BFG's guidance.&nbsp;
After pointing out his country is outside the map,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:14.160
BFG pours frobscottle for everyone, even&nbsp;
the corgis. They all toast to his name and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:19.120
take a sip, which causes them to pass some gas.
The Queen declares it's time to execute the plan&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:24.480
then. BFG runs back to Giant Country, the army&nbsp;
follows him on their planes. When they reach the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:29.840
thick clouds, the planes' radars and controls go&nbsp;
crazy, but they manage to cross safely anyway. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:33.920
army decides to stay back and wait for the right&nbsp;
moment while BFG and Sophie return to the dream&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:38.240
lab. There, they make a new nightmare for the&nbsp;
giants using the one she caught at the lake - this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:43.680
one will cause horrible despair. After the mixing&nbsp;
is done, they take the jar outside, and BFG tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:48.480
Sophie her own dream is having a family, which she&nbsp;
can't achieve if she stays there. BFG tells her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:52.400
not to worry though, because he'll always be there&nbsp;
for her and able to hear her with his overly big&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:57.600
ears. When the sun comes out, it's time to spread&nbsp;
the nightmare to the giants, but BFG realizes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:01.840
he forgot his trumpet at the palace, so Sophie&nbsp;
grabs the jar and takes it to the giants herself.&nbsp;

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:07.120
She walks to the middle of the sleeping giants&nbsp;
but fails to open the jar. Fleshlumpeater wakes up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:11.520
then and sees her, so Sophie improvises and breaks&nbsp;
the jar to release the nightmare, which quickly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:16.000
invades the giants' minds. Fleshlumpeater catches&nbsp;
his and crushes it, but the other giants are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.880
affected by it, so they start running around as&nbsp;
guilt consumes them. Getting angry, Fleshlumpeater&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:25.760
tries to snatch Sophie, but BFG jumps in to defend&nbsp;
her. Fleshlumpeater picks him up and is about to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:29.920
punch him when his arm is suddenly grabbed&nbsp;
by some wire: the planes are finally here.&nbsp;

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:33.600
Sophie runs around the field to avoid being&nbsp;
hit as the army descends on them, capturing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:38.240
all the giants with wires and nets. BFG comes to&nbsp;
pick her up to keep her safe and together they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:42.960
watch the planes fly away, carrying the giants&nbsp;
with them. They are taken to an isolated island&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:47.040
they can't escape, and the only food they're left&nbsp;
with is the disgusting snozzcumber and its seeds.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:51.920
Meanwhile, Sophie returns to London, where she&nbsp;
moves to Buckingham Palace to live with Mary,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:56.080
Mr. Tibbs and the Queen's corgis.
The movie ends with Sophie waking up one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:56.080 --> 00:15:00.080
morning and telling us about the dream she had&nbsp;
of BFG living happily in his country with new,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:03.840
better-tasting vegetables to grow in his&nbsp;
garden. She approaches the window and, like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:08.400
she always does when she's lonely, she whispers&nbsp;
words to the wind, knowing they'll reach BFG.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:11.840
Back in Giant Country, BFG smiles&nbsp;
when those words reach his ears.
