00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:11.280
Hey everyone. Welcome back to Movie Recap.&nbsp;
My name is Silverra. Today I'm gonna show&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.920
you a 2017 Australian-French psychological&nbsp;
thriller-horror film called, Berlin Syndrome.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.760
The film opens with Clare arriving in Berlin,&nbsp;
Germany, as a young female tourist. She walks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.560
to her accommodation, a hostel with group&nbsp;
bunking rooms and spends the evening partying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.480
with some people, possibly also tourists, on the&nbsp;
rooftop. She takes photos of the sunrise and in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.680
the morning dresses and takes her backpack with&nbsp;
her out sightseeing. She purchases some clothes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.160
photo slides and takes photos in the street -&nbsp;
one of a woman airing a colorful sheet out an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.080
apartment window. She visits a bookshop and takes&nbsp;
interest in a book of artworks. Leaving the shop,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.880
she follows out a man and they meet on the&nbsp;
footpath waiting at a set of traffic lights.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:59.440
He drops his belongings and Clare assists&nbsp;
him, after which a conversation sparks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.160
where he casually asks why she's travelling&nbsp;
alone and offers her some strawberries.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:09.760
Clare goes with this man, Andi, to see the public&nbsp;
garden where the strawberries grow. They talk and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.560
get to know each other, Andi mentioning it's a&nbsp;
good place to "complicate life", Clare corrects&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.360
him "contemplate life". Clare ignores a call&nbsp;
from her mother. He drives her back to her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.599
accommodation where they nearly kiss. She invites&nbsp;
him up for a drink at the bar and he declines.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.840
The following day Clare ventures out sightseeing&nbsp;
again and looking for Andi who she finds in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.280
same bookshop looking at the book of artworks.&nbsp;
They spend the day together. He drives them back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.800
to his place which is very quiet and desolate. His&nbsp;
upstairs apartment is tucked away behind a locked&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.200
building foyer, through a small enclosed&nbsp;
courtyard into the building block behind.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.640
They spend the night and she talks&nbsp;
about how much she'd like to stay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.360
rather than move onto her next destination&nbsp;
Dusseldorf. In the morning he leaves for work,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.965
teaching at a local school. One student, Franka&nbsp;
details a book the class was asked to read.

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:08.320
Clare gets dressed, packs up a day pack and&nbsp;
goes to leave discovering she is locked into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:14.240
the apartment. She cannot find a spare key and&nbsp;
also finds the windows don't open. Believing this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.034
an accident she hangs in the apartment, making&nbsp;
herself some food and waits for Andi to return.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.520
He arrives home where Clare explains she&nbsp;
couldn't leave and he realises he forgot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.480
to leave a key for her which he finds in his&nbsp;
pocket. She jokingly suggests "did you lock me&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.280
in?" and he playfully replies "yes sure, but&nbsp;
next time I'll tie you to the bed" and they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.560
have meat injection game in the shower. They&nbsp;
go out clubbing and she stays a second night.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.800
In the morning when he leaves for work he points&nbsp;
out the key he's left for her on the dresser.

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.080
She casually pokes around the apartment while&nbsp;
cooking herself breakfast and finds the book of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:55.280
artworks from the bookshop. She opens it to her&nbsp;
favorite page and finds a photo of her asleep&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.960
with the word 'mine' written on her shoulder,&nbsp;
resting in the pages. Bothered by this she also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.200
realises her necklace with her ring is missing.&nbsp;
Her mother had given her the ring to "hock and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:11.280
return home if she gets into trouble" but it also&nbsp;
has sentimental value. She searches the apartment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.560
and begins to panic, discovering the key won't&nbsp;
open the door, her mobile phone has no service,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.920
the other internal door is also locked, and none&nbsp;
of the available windows open. Feeling in danger&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.925
now she tries to break the window with a chair&nbsp;
and finds a second, reinforced panel behind.

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:35.360
When Andi returns she's waiting at the door and&nbsp;
asks to leave but he won't let her past. He locks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:40.080
the door and confronts her about the broken&nbsp;
window, telling her casually if she tries to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.880
break the window he will have to border them up.&nbsp;
Now understanding the weight of the situation she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:50.240
pleads for him to let her go but he dismisses her&nbsp;
concerns and hands her flowers and asks if she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:55.920
likes pasta. Frustrated at his insanity she bursts&nbsp;
violently into a rage trying to kick and punch&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.800
him but he subdues her and ties her to the bed&nbsp;
explaining that no one can hear her screams, the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:05.840
buildings are abandoned. The camera pans out to&nbsp;
reveal her screams are not heard from the street.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.480
The following day Andi visits his&nbsp;
father who asks why he was late.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:17.680
Andi says he met someone and tells him&nbsp;
about Clare. His father asks about Natalie,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.461
the girl he has been seeing and Andi&nbsp;
tells him she returned to Canada.

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:28.320
Andi returns to the apartment where he has&nbsp;
continued to tie Clare to the bed on a plastic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:33.520
sheet. She is untied for a shower as she has&nbsp;
urinated on herself, and finds clumps of long&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:38.400
blonde hair in the drain, realising there has&nbsp;
been someone here before her. He brings her home&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:43.520
a puzzle and enthusiastically tells her, he told&nbsp;
his father about her and has texted her Mum that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:48.960
she is okay. Clare threatens that her mum will&nbsp;
realise the truth. He continued to ignore her.

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:56.000
The next day Andi leaves for work, leaving Clare&nbsp;
untied and free to roam the apartment as she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.880
cannot escape. We see him lock the keys in&nbsp;
a lock-box and leave it on a shelf in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:06.560
building corridor. Clare searches the apartment,&nbsp;
finding a screwdriver under the couch. At work,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.240
Andi is annoyed at a teacher who uses&nbsp;
his cup from the communal kitchen,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.880
uncomfortable the woman&nbsp;
empties it and washes it out.

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:20.800
He returns home to find Clare doing the puzzle,&nbsp;
he helps her and she takes the opportunity to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:25.440
stab the screwdriver through his hand resting&nbsp;
on the tabletop, pinning him to the table.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:30.800
She grabs the keys and escapes down the stairwell&nbsp;
and across the courtyard, but a clunky door jams&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:35.600
and Andi catches her and crushes her hand in the&nbsp;
door as she escapes through the front building,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:39.520
breaking her finger. He carries a&nbsp;
passed out Clare back to the apartment.

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:47.200
The following day he meets his father. When&nbsp;
he returns home Clare tries to return calmness&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:52.240
to the hostile situation. She continues to&nbsp;
plead to him and tells him she misses her Mum&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.560
but Andi tells her, there's no point missing&nbsp;
something you won't get back, and that she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:02.560
has him instead. Andi constantly takes photos of&nbsp;
Clare in odd and disturbed poses, usually naked.

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:11.040
The next day Andi watches the female student,&nbsp;
Franka in gym class, aroused. Meanwhile,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:15.920
Clare attempts to pick the door locks with a&nbsp;
paperclip, snapping one off in the internal door,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:21.200
and worries Andi will discover her attempt. We see&nbsp;
that Andi has locked all the sharp tools in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:26.720
lock-box with the key. He continues to taunt and&nbsp;
intimidate Clare both mentally and emotionally,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:31.360
moving between affection, possessiveness&nbsp;
and cruelty. Andi is washing Clare in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:36.320
shower when Franka knocks at the door. Andi&nbsp;
threatens Clare that if she says anything,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:40.560
he will kill the girl. Andi answers&nbsp;
the door and Franka flirts with him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:44.880
stating she followed him home. Seeing&nbsp;
Clare standing in a towel in the hallway,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:50.240
Andi tells her she's his girlfriend and is cruel&nbsp;
to her so she leaves. Back inside the apartment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:56.080
Clare enquires about the girl, asking her name,&nbsp;
and Andi cuts her hair, again photographing her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:00.129
Later he discovers the internal door&nbsp;
won't open and gets cross with Clare.

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:07.680
We see time pass, it's now Christmas. Clare&nbsp;
is living in terror, but as Andi continues to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:13.200
toy with her she begins to unravel and act out,&nbsp;
Andi at one point asking her to be 'normal' and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:18.400
gets violent in his frustration at her behavior,&nbsp;
leaving to stay with his father. The power in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:23.760
apartment goes out and Clare is stuck for days&nbsp;
without power. It's freezing cold and she eats&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:29.520
the little food she finds. Andi's father dies and&nbsp;
upset, he waits a few days to call the caretaker,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:34.800
remaining in his father's house. Clare finds&nbsp;
another girls toenail trimming under the bed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:38.720
Clare is relieved when Andi returns&nbsp;
to the apartment a few days later.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:43.360
Andi was unaware of the power outage and&nbsp;
tells him "she thought he wasn't coming back".&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:48.160
She comforts him about his father's passing and&nbsp;
they continue to have another meat injection game.

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:55.600
Clare begins warming to the situation, cleaning,&nbsp;
cooking, making an effort with her appearance,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:55.600 --> 00:08:01.360
playing music. Andi gives her a book and his&nbsp;
father's dog for Christmas. Clare asks the details&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:05.840
of why he chose her and he explains he saw her in&nbsp;
the street looking at the woman airing the sheet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:10.400
out the window, unveiling that he had planned&nbsp;
their meeting in the bookshop. Clare asks about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:15.440
the previous girl, and we see a sudden shift in&nbsp;
his affection for Clare, annoyed at her questions.

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:23.200
Sometime later, he takes her from the apartment&nbsp;
into an isolated forest. He's carrying an axe.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:28.640
While Clare appreciates being outside finally&nbsp;
he lifts his axe behind her. But a young boy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:33.600
shouts and runs over, interrupting, asking&nbsp;
to help his brother who has hurt his leg.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:38.320
Surprised at their presence, Andi is&nbsp;
distracted and Clare seizes an opportunity&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:42.960
to try to alert the other boy, but he doesn't&nbsp;
understand english and is frightened by her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:48.160
urgency. Andi notices and is angry at Clare.&nbsp;
When the mother collects her children,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:53.440
Andi leads Clare back to the car and forces&nbsp;
her into the boot, returning to the apartment.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:58.240
Andi now annoyed at Clare's presence and jealous&nbsp;
of her relationship with the dog, takes the dog&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:03.840
for a walk and doesn't return with it, stating it&nbsp;
'ran away'. Clare is alone again and heartbroken.

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:10.480
While Andi attends a New Year's Eve&nbsp;
party, Clare breaks into the locked room,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:16.640
finding his camera, a massage chair, and a photo&nbsp;
album of Clare in captivity. Clare also finds an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:22.240
album of another girl, blonde, bound and abused&nbsp;
in the same way. Andi attempts to lure another&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:27.360
young female tourist, sparking conversation and&nbsp;
using the same miss-wording he used with Clare,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:32.240
confusing 'contemplate life' with 'compensate&nbsp;
life', but the girl leaves with her friend.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:36.720
Back in the kitchen, Clare notices a torchlight&nbsp;
shining from another apartment across the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:42.080
courtyard and alerts the person to her distress,&nbsp;
screaming and smashing the repaired window pane.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:46.240
A man reaches the apartment door&nbsp;
nearly freeing Clare, but Andi returns&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:50.880
and kills him with a hammer. Andi taunts&nbsp;
Clare that it is her fault the man is dead&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:55.930
and forces her to help wrap up the body which&nbsp;
he burns in the coal pit in courtyard outside.

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:01.600
The following day Andi cleans the&nbsp;
blood and boards up the windows,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:06.880
punishing Clare. He notices a missing persons&nbsp;
ad in the local paper, with Clare's picture and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:12.240
flustered asks Clare to pack her bags because&nbsp;
he is fumigating the apartment. Clare notices&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:17.360
student workbooks on the table that Andi&nbsp;
is grading. She purposefully burns her hand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:22.089
and while Andi grabs some cream from the&nbsp;
bathroom, she stashes away Franka's workbook.

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:29.680
The following morning Andi tips out all&nbsp;
the drinks and takes his and Clare's bags,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:34.080
leaving Clare behind in the apartment.&nbsp;
Downstairs he stashes Clare's bag in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:39.680
the basement and turns off the pipes, leaving&nbsp;
Clare without water. At school he hands out the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:44.720
workbooks and Franka finds a photo of Clare&nbsp;
bound and gagged slipped between the pages.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:49.360
Without drawing attention to her discovery,&nbsp;
Franka excuses herself from the classroom&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:54.720
and flees promptly on her bike. The photo is found&nbsp;
on the floor by the other students and panicked,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:54.720 --> 00:11:00.560
Andi rushes back to the apartment, getting stuck&nbsp;
in traffic. Andi finds Franka's bike outside the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:05.760
front building and sees where she has broken in&nbsp;
through a basement window. He finds the hammer and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:11.120
the lock-box open in the courtyard, and a window&nbsp;
in the building block open. The apartment door is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:17.120
open and Clare is gone. He follows muddy footsteps&nbsp;
up the stairwell and we see him follow them past&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:22.000
Clare hiding in a stairwell cupboard. Just as&nbsp;
he reaches the room where Franka is hiding,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:27.600
Clare calls from downstairs, luring him back&nbsp;
into the apartment. Once he is distracted inside,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:32.000
Clare manages to slip out and lock the&nbsp;
apartment door with Andi now trapped inside.

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:39.200
A wave of euphoric relief washes over Clare&nbsp;
as she realizes she is finally free from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:43.840
the apartment and Andi. Andi now pleading&nbsp;
for Clare to free him from the apartment,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:47.680
she screams in victory, chucking the&nbsp;
keys against the outside of the door,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:53.360
taunting Andi. She collects Franka and has found&nbsp;
a bag with her passport and her mother's ring.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:57.520
The final shots are of Andi relaxing in&nbsp;
his massage chair and Clare riding in a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:01.505
car through Berlin, passing tourists&nbsp;
sightseeing, enjoying her freedom.

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:08.000
