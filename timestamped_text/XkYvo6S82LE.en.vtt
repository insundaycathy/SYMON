00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:05.000
If you woke up in a maze of trapped cubes,
what would you do?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.030
In this How to Beat video, we’ll follow
the cube captives, see if we can make better

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.919
decisions, and ultimately attempt to beat
the DEATH MAZE in, Cube.

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:15.099
If you think you have a better way, let me
know in the comments!

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:18.320

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.950
Before we start, let me be clear.

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:24.949
I’m not good with math, and I am positive
I'm wrong about a lot of things I talk about.

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:26.189
Please correct me in the comments.

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.410
I know you will.

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.050
We start out following a man named Alderson,
who woke up in a sci-fi looking cube.

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.210
Imagine just going about your day, then waking
up in here.

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.090
You just know you’re not gonna have a good
time.

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.960
This ain’t an ordinary room, and nothing
about it seems hospitable in the slightest.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.460
The first red flag is that he’s wearing
a prisoner’s uniform, but there’s no toilet,

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.590
bed, food, or water, so this is arguably worse
than a prison.

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.200
Even Goreng from The Platform got these amenities.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.489
The good news is that it’s not a straight
up execution, or he’d already be dead.

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:02.489
I guess it could still be an execution, and
the Cube people just wanna have a little fun

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.470
with him first.

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:10.150
However, it’s most likely an experiment
or a gauntlet, in which case the only reasonable

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:14.360
thing to do is assume you can win your freedom
and become the Cube Warrior’s version of

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:15.840
a Rudiarius.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.970
Alderson pops some doors open to see what’s
what.

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:29.270
When he opens the door to the blue room, there
is a weird sound.

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.060
But when he opens the red room, there isn’t
a sound.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.630
And when he opens the orange room, the same
weird sound from the blue room plays.

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.700
What that means, I don’t know.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.380
Unfortunately this looks like a trial and
error puzzle, and I don’t think you get

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:50.720
a second chance.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:02:07.440
Well, that’s the end of this guy's story.

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:08.840
Brah didn’t even know what hit him.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.969
You might feel sorry for this guy, but I think
he got off easy.

00:02:11.969 --> 00:02:16.629
This was a fairly rudimentary trap for such
a sophisticated environment, which makes me

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:20.000
lean towards this being a game or gauntlet.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.980
They have to have cameras somewhere streaming
to a Pay Per View audience.

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.670
Why would you waste perfectly good entertainment?

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:32.680
Unpopular opinion, they should bring back
gladiatorial type games, upgraded with modern

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.379
technology and engineering.

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:36.750
Supermarket Sweep just isn’t cutting it.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.519
Somewhere else in the cube we have two other
survivors, Quentin and Worth.

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:42.280
Each person seems to wake up from a drugged
state in a different room.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.840
The door next to them opens up and Quentin
judo throws the woman to the ground.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:47.920
This nice lady’s name is Holloway.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:04:19.610
In the background there’s a 
loud noise, like something large and mechanical

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:22.080
is moving outside the room.

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:31.200
Another girl, Leaven, joins them, as well
as a man named Rennes.

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.470
The more the merrier considering someone has
to test out each room for traps.

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:38.500
Now would be a good time for everyone to compare
notes.

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.640
Quentin and Rennes already had experience
with traps before meeting up.

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:47.260
It’s likely they both have encountered different
types of traps, as well as the presence of

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.220
other non-trapped rooms.

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:53.870
It should be apparent that they’re in a
maze of cubes that doubles as a minefield,

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:57.670
and there should be a safe path around the
traps and out of the maze.

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:02.100
I initially thought they might be playing
some sort of 3 dimensional minesweeper, but

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:07.100
there’s nothing that indicates the number
of trap rooms they might be surrounded by.

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:10.060
These are the two problems they need to find
solutions for now.

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:11.060
1.

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:12.060
A trap detection method.

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:13.060
2.

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:14.060
Where an exit would be.

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:18.040
It’s best to solve the first problem before
moving on to the second.

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:22.550
Until you can safely navigate the cube, finding
an exit path is somewhat moot.

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:27.260
Detecting what rooms are trapped is difficult
because the traps are invisible until activated

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.330
by a human presence.

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.110
There’s two ways this can go down.

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:37.640
Either we are able to reliably, physically
detect and/or cross traps, which is unlikely,

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:42.050
or more likely there has to be a trap detection
method we haven’t discovered yet.

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:47.340
If there isn’t a way to reliably, physically
detect traps, it invalidates the player’s

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:50.780
decisions, which invalidates the cube’s
purpose as a game.

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:55.460
We already concluded that it’s most likely
a game, so in this case it means there has

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:57.610
to be another way to detect traps.

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:01.710
I’d gather as much information that they
can observe, which would amount to:

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:02.710
1.

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:05.940
Does anyone have any useful skills or knowledge
2.

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:10.050
Is noise or no noise when opening cube doors
correlated with traps

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:11.050
3.

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:13.660
Is the color of the room correlated with traps
4.

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:16.910
Are the room number plates in each cube correlated
with traps

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:17.910
5.

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:20.190
The background noise appearing at random intervals
6.

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:23.770
Or anything else that’s not identical room
to room.

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:28.190
Besides these variables, everything else is
identical and can’t be used.

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:33.240
Then I'd start manually testing all surrounding
rooms for traps and assessing for any correlations

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:34.880
of the above variables.

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:38.820
Like Rennes discovered, you can use your boot
to trigger a lot of traps.

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:40.680
Enough to find correlations.

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:46.340
But let me be clear, do not use physical trap
detection as a final determinate for a cube’s

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:47.340
safety.

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:52.300
Our cube captives also decide to manually
detect trap rooms, and with some initial success

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:57.330
they wrongly conclude that physically detecting
traps is 100% reliable.

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:01.590
While booting a room is fairly effective in
detecting many traps, it’s almost certainly

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:03.470
catastrophically wrong.

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:07.410
You only have to be wrong once, just ask Alderson.

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:12.280
The problem which they already know is that
there are a variety of traps that have a variety

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:13.750
of activation triggers.

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:17.900
A trap could detect a human based on motion,
sound, and pressure.

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:19.390
All things a boot could trigger.

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:24.270
But traps could also be triggered based on
thermals, chemicals, tripwires, and a host

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:29.420
of other things like thresholds, time-activation,
location-specificity, and any combinations

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:30.420
of these.

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:34.960
For example, a trap could be a spike that
gets instantly thrust up through your body,

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:41.220
but is only activated if you step on a certain
tile of the room, with 150lbs of pressure,

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:45.590
for a minimum of 10 second, and only when
a heat signature is present.

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:50.750
It would be impossible to test this trap unless
you physically walked into the trapped cube,

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:53.780
and by the time you knew a trap existed you
were dead.

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:58.620
If you have to move into another cube to further
test your trap detection method, in addition

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:03.370
to booting, I'd also try to test for thermals
and chemicals by giving the unknown cube a

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:05.620
nice slap from within the corridor.

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:10.710
If that works, have 1 person cross the entire
cube at a time while being ready to Dodge,

00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:12.930
Duck, Dip, Dive and Dodge.

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:18.090
Our protagonists choose the logical, yet seemingly
too obvious strategy of going in a straight

00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:21.270
line while detouring around trap rooms.

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:25.740
That same mechanical background noise starts
again, and Rennes remarks that it’s occurring

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:27.330
in regular intervals.

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:29.800
A piece to the puzzle, no doubt.

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:35.949
Maybe we are in a giant shuffling Rubik's
cube and the goal is to solve it, but there

00:08:35.949 --> 00:08:40.379
isn’t a mechanism for shifting cubes, and
the shifting is happening at random intervals

00:08:40.379 --> 00:08:42.249
completely outside of their control.

00:08:42.249 --> 00:08:45.500
So that's a no Rubik’s cube theory.

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:49.749
Leaven and the crew just now discover that
there are serial numbers pointing to each

00:08:49.749 --> 00:08:50.749
room.

00:08:50.749 --> 00:08:52.629
How the hell did they miss this.

00:08:52.629 --> 00:08:56.769
The rooms are practically identical except
for like 2 things.

00:08:56.769 --> 00:09:03.610
The first number she reads is 566.472.737,
which is the room they are going into.

00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:11.819
The second number she reads is 476.804.539,
which is the room they came from.

00:09:11.819 --> 00:09:15.699
It’s not.

00:09:15.699 --> 00:09:25.160
If these were room numbers, based on 566,472,737
rooms, and at a diameter of 14 feet per room

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:31.079
plus 1 feet of hatchways on either side, you’re
looking at a diameter of 2.5 miles and nearly

00:09:31.079 --> 00:09:33.970
16 cubic miles of cubes.

00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:39.399
The diameter of this monstrosity would be
like 12 aircraft carriers lined up end to

00:09:39.399 --> 00:09:40.399
end.

00:09:40.399 --> 00:09:46.499
I highly, highly doubt an organization built
1800 aircraft carriers worth of cubes for

00:09:46.499 --> 00:09:48.550
7 people to wander around.

00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:53.310
While we don’t know how big the cube is,
it has to be way smaller than they think.

00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:57.759
Even if they were room numbers, they don’t
seem to be sequential, so unless they are

00:09:57.759 --> 00:10:00.749
encoded somehow they are no use for finding
an exit.

00:10:00.749 --> 00:10:05.389
And even if they were sequential, we still
don’t know where an exit might be.

00:10:05.389 --> 00:10:09.879
So far, these numbers aren’t helping as
a trap detection method or for finding a way

00:10:09.879 --> 00:10:10.879
out.

00:10:10.879 --> 00:10:12.839
Which is concerning and odd.

00:10:12.839 --> 00:10:18.540
From the six potential variables we’ve observed
none seem to be correlated with solutions.

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:22.370
The numbers stand out because they could be
some type of code.

00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:24.399
They must be missing something.

00:10:24.399 --> 00:10:30.080
The numbers have to mean something.

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:38.950
It’s possible they need more information
before they can figure out solutions.

00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:43.210
Heading towards a side and traveling along
it while looking for exits would potentially

00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:45.560
give them the dimensions of the main cube.

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:50.529
I’d also leave pieces of ripped clothing
as line markers to indicate if they have already

00:10:50.529 --> 00:10:54.459
been in that cube, and that it’s not trapped
in case they need to backtrack.

00:10:54.459 --> 00:10:59.209
Like we saw in my As above so below video,
these little guys can be the difference between

00:10:59.209 --> 00:11:05.149
life and death.

00:11:05.149 --> 00:11:12.329
This is a pretty interesting quirk.

00:11:12.329 --> 00:11:17.240
There’s probably some benefit to relieving
a parched mouth in the face of dehydration,

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:20.920
but I doubt they need that right now as it’s
only been a few hours.

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:25.620
Rennes boots the next room and it looks clear
of traps, but he holds the group up anyways.

00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:30.740
He says that the air is dry in there, and
that there may be a molecular sensor based

00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:34.339
trap that detects hydrogen sulfide excreted
from skin.

00:11:34.339 --> 00:11:39.450
I don’t know enough about biology to confirm
or deny this, but the internet does indicate

00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:43.670
that humans do produce and excrete this chemical
in some manner.

00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:49.089
It’s probably a good idea to avoid rooms
that present abnormalities and don’t conform

00:11:49.089 --> 00:11:52.720
to the patterns associated with non-trapped
rooms.

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:56.620
Rennes reveals that he is a 7-time escapee
of French prisons.

00:11:56.620 --> 00:12:00.939
It might seem like a good idea to follow a
prison escape artist's lead, but this isn’t

00:12:00.939 --> 00:12:01.939
a prison.

00:12:01.939 --> 00:12:06.480
If it was a prison, there wouldn’t be doors
and there would be traps on every side.

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:11.630
They are in a 3D maze that must have a path
out, they just need to cautiously unravel

00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:34.790
the game's rules.

00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:38.740
Great advice Houdini, I think we will stop
to think things through if that’s chill

00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:39.740
with you.

00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:41.089
You got something on your face by the way.

00:12:41.089 --> 00:12:46.999
It’s now clear that physically testing traps
isn’t reliable, so trap detection must be

00:12:46.999 --> 00:12:52.290
based on one of the aforementioned variables,
likely the numbering system.

00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:56.389
Rennes should have slapped the interior of
the cube first before hopping in, it’s pretty

00:12:56.389 --> 00:13:02.189
dumb for someone who supposedly knows a lot
about sensors to not account for thermal sensors.

00:13:02.189 --> 00:13:07.269
His dodge game wasn’t on point either, instead
of diving out of the way he just stood there

00:13:07.269 --> 00:13:09.139
and said merde.

00:13:09.139 --> 00:13:13.300
The crew finally does what they should have
done a long ass time ago.

00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:14.920
Share information.

00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:19.509
We know Quentin is a cop, Rennes ‘was’
an escape artist, we don’t know anything

00:13:19.509 --> 00:13:28.300
about Alderson other than he was one unlucky
SOB, but what about the others.

00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:38.209
Okay, that’s not helpful at all.

00:13:38.209 --> 00:13:43.839
We need specific details.

00:13:43.839 --> 00:13:58.589
That’s better, but still too vague.

00:13:58.589 --> 00:14:02.679
Can everyone stop being intentionally opaque,
good god.

00:14:02.679 --> 00:14:06.470
Nobody cares about your
Edgar Allan Poe bullshit, just give a straight

00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:07.470
answer.

00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:10.069
We are on the clock in a life and death situation
here.

00:14:10.069 --> 00:14:13.829
Quentin uses his X-Ray detective skills..
..

00:14:13.829 --> 00:14:18.529
of the survivors to discover that Leaven is
a math student.

00:14:18.529 --> 00:14:22.310
It really shouldn’t have been that hard
to figure out, but everyone felt like wasting

00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:24.589
time being ambiguous for no reason.

00:14:24.589 --> 00:14:29.639
Leaven uses her special math powers to assess
the mysterious room numbers and determines

00:14:29.639 --> 00:14:35.310
that the trapped rooms they had encountered
all had 3 sequences of 3 digit prime numbers.

00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:39.709
For everyone that ignored everything taught
in math class like me, prime numbers are numbers

00:14:39.709 --> 00:14:43.110
that have only 2 factors: 1 and themselves.

00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:49.449
None of these number sequences are prime,
so the room is theoretically safe.

00:14:49.449 --> 00:14:58.760
Right, but like Quentin is trying to say,
that’s only 3 data points which is a low

00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:01.259
enough sample size to be coincidence.

00:15:01.259 --> 00:15:07.160
If half the rooms were traps, they can only
really be 87.5% confident in this method.

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:09.279
Sounds like a lot, but it’s really not.

00:15:09.279 --> 00:15:13.329
This whole time I've been speculating that
the numbers mean something, and I think what

00:15:13.329 --> 00:15:16.959
she’s onto is worth testing, but you will
only know if the theory holds up with a high

00:15:16.959 --> 00:15:21.139
degree of confidence once you’ve tested
at least 10 rooms.

00:15:21.139 --> 00:15:25.540
Even then, the cost of physically checking
a room too is low, so you might as well sniff,

00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:28.079
slap, and boot every room anyways.

00:15:28.079 --> 00:15:32.759
The montage of them navigating rooms seems
pretty convincing that prime numbers are the

00:15:32.759 --> 00:15:34.640
key to detecting traps.

00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:39.499
So they seemed to have solved the trap detection
problem, but they still haven’t solved the

00:15:39.499 --> 00:15:41.329
exit path problem.

00:15:41.329 --> 00:15:45.500
Since there really isn’t anything else that
they can use to determine an exit path, and

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:50.379
the numbers were a form of key to half their
problem, it’s likely the numbers are also

00:15:50.379 --> 00:15:52.559
a key to the other half of their problem.

00:15:52.559 --> 00:15:56.589
It’s a good thing Rennes got faceshotted
instead of Leaven because there is no way

00:15:56.589 --> 00:15:58.889
they would have figured that out by themselves.

00:15:58.889 --> 00:16:03.429
On that note, they need to keep Leaven alive
at all costs because she’s probably their

00:16:03.429 --> 00:16:07.959
only chance of figuring out a way out of here.

00:16:07.959 --> 00:16:12.019
They should continue heading towards a side
of the cube so they can map out the potential

00:16:12.019 --> 00:16:14.279
dimensions of the main cube.

00:16:14.279 --> 00:16:19.300
Eventually they hit a dead end with traps
on all sides and are forced to backtrack.

00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:24.429
By now they’re probably getting claustrophobic,
dehydrated, and a bit delirious.

00:16:24.429 --> 00:16:29.139
This is where line markers would be nice to
have, it would lower the mental burden of

00:16:29.139 --> 00:16:33.079
doing math and double checking each room you
may have already been in.

00:16:33.079 --> 00:16:37.279
Their detour around the dead end is put on
pause when they hear some noises coming from

00:16:37.279 --> 00:16:38.519
the cube above them.

00:16:38.519 --> 00:16:41.639
Quentin pops the door and another person falls
through.

00:16:41.639 --> 00:16:45.420
His name is Kazan and he appears to have some
type of mental disorder.

00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:49.740
On a side note it’s interesting how all
of the captives are named and characterized

00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:51.889
after famous prisons around the world.

00:16:51.889 --> 00:16:57.019
Kazan has a mental condition of sorts, which
relates to the Kazan Prison Mental Hospital

00:16:57.019 --> 00:16:58.019
in Russia.

00:16:58.019 --> 00:17:02.179
Quentin is a male and San Quentin is a prison
for males.

00:17:02.179 --> 00:17:05.020
Holloway is a female and Holloway Prison is
female-only.

00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:08.329
Rennes, Rennes Prison.

00:17:08.329 --> 00:17:11.010
Leaven and Worth, Leavenworth.

00:17:11.010 --> 00:17:15.620
Also interesting that these two share a prison
name.

00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:18.209
I don’t think any of this helps them though.

00:17:18.209 --> 00:17:22.449
The captives continue their straight line
path to the side of the cube while checking

00:17:22.449 --> 00:17:24.709
for prime number based trap rooms.

00:17:24.709 --> 00:17:45.179
But this time, there’s a problem.

00:17:45.179 --> 00:17:48.659
This is exactly why I kept saying to tread
carefully.

00:17:48.659 --> 00:17:54.110
To think that prime numbers solved everything
was foolish, even with it being a pretty successful

00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:55.110
strategy.

00:17:55.110 --> 00:17:58.520
Luckily for Quentin, this trap gave him time
to dive out of the way.

00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:03.320
The prime number trap detection theory is
far from worthless, because there is obviously

00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:05.360
a significant correlation.

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:09.130
It’s likely that there is just some caveat
or additional piece to it.

00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:13.909
Under investigation from Quentin, Worth reveals
that he’s an engineer that was contracted

00:18:13.909 --> 00:18:19.060
to build the shell of this cube, or sarcophagus
as he pessimistically puts it.

00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:23.880
He claims he knows nothing of the interior
except that the shell does not sit flush against

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:25.620
the cube of cubes.

00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:28.460
Worth, you piece of shit.

00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:35.450
I knew that woe is me garbage was a projection
of guilt or a diversion from his actual profession

00:18:35.450 --> 00:18:36.940
and affiliations.

00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:41.150
When questioned about who was in charge, why
the cube was built, and what it’s purpose

00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:45.549
is, he goes on a nihilistic tirade that it
was just built because we could, and that

00:18:45.549 --> 00:18:50.340
nobody was in charge and it was just a headless
blunder operating under the illusion of a

00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:51.960
master plan.

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:53.370
Uh, okay.

00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:58.399
You just admitted that you were a victim of
compartmentalization and now you’re claiming

00:18:58.399 --> 00:19:00.090
to know all about the cube.

00:19:00.090 --> 00:19:01.140
I’m not buying it.

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:03.720
There’s no point in being hopeless anyways.

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:10.190
Now knowing Worth has knowledge of the exterior,
Leaven jumps in and questions him further.

00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:16.559
Worth reveals that the cube is 434 feet squared,
and that there most likely is 1 cube worth

00:19:16.559 --> 00:19:21.790
of space between the shell and the main cube,
and that there is a door on one side of the

00:19:21.790 --> 00:19:24.659
shell, but he doesn’t know which side it’s
on.

00:19:24.659 --> 00:19:29.649
Wow, that was super important information
we definitely could have used earlier.

00:19:29.649 --> 00:19:37.620
Leaven measures the interior of the cube to
be 14 feet in diameter, and deduces that 27x27

00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:43.860
cubes would fit flush with the shell, so 26x26
cubes would be accurate according to Worth’s

00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:44.860
statement.

00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:50.860
But 434 divided by 14 equals 31 rooms flush
and 30 rooms with space.

00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:56.930
According to Leavens calculations of 27 rooms
flush, 26 with space, that would mean each

00:19:56.930 --> 00:19:59.690
cube is 16 feet and some change.

00:19:59.690 --> 00:20:05.039
She’s probably assuming 1 foot of hatchway
on either side plus some siding which makes

00:20:05.039 --> 00:20:06.039
the difference.

00:20:06.039 --> 00:20:11.139
This means there are 17576 rooms total.

00:20:11.139 --> 00:20:16.760
To put it in perspective, the cube is just
a little bit smaller than NASA's Vehicle Assembly

00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:17.760
Building.

00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:24.330
It’s big, but definitely not 2000 aircraft
carriers worth.

00:20:24.330 --> 00:20:28.940
Leaven has another epiphany, that the numbers
are not just correlated to whether or not

00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:33.529
the rooms are trapped, but that they might
be coded cartesian coordinates, which are

00:20:33.529 --> 00:20:36.500
grid coordinates for a 3 dimensional space.

00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:40.860
If you’re wondering, she yells Descartes
because cartesian coordinates were named after

00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:42.530
him.

00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:46.830
She thinks that if you add up the numbers
in each 3 digit sequence, it will provide

00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:49.120
an x,y,z coordinate.

00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:54.130
The decoding seems arbitrary and unlikely
to be discovered, but for someone with a math

00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:55.130
eye..

00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:58.590
It’s still pretty arbitrary and unlikely
to be discovered.

00:20:58.590 --> 00:21:05.220
I guess knowing that the maximum size of the
shell is 27x27x27 and that the number layout

00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:12.330
coupled with the maximum number sequence could
be 999,999,999 might lead her to add up the

00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:15.510
9’s to get 27x27x27.

00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:20.990
This also works because so far, they have
not come across negative or zero room numbers.

00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:25.990
A negative number would enable the cube to
be bigger than 27 cubes per side.

00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:30.490
This indicates that the smallest room number
would be 001,001,001, or x,y, and z all equal

00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:31.490
1.

00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:35.450
The cartesian coordinate scheme seems to work
with everything else they know but there are

00:21:35.450 --> 00:21:37.139
some things that are odd.

00:21:37.139 --> 00:21:41.720
Worth mentioned that the shell has a door,
and that there is 1 cube worth of space between

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:44.030
the main cube and shell.

00:21:44.030 --> 00:21:48.130
According to this cartesian coordinate scheme,
a cube could fill that gap.

00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:52.700
But if a cube could fill that gap, why is
it empty space according to Worth?

00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:57.909
Also, the room numbers are obviously not cartesian
coordinates of their current location.

00:21:57.909 --> 00:22:01.750
Every room around them and that they’ve
passed through have seemingly random coordinates.

00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:06.880
If you go in one direction on the x-axis,
you should expect that the numbers will increase

00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:09.170
or decrease, but they don’t.

00:22:09.170 --> 00:22:13.549
Does this mean the cartesian coordinate theory
is busted, no.

00:22:13.549 --> 00:22:17.380
Like the prime number theory, it’s most
likely a bit more involved.

00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:21.880
I think right now it’s probably a bit of
a stretch, but definitely within the possibility

00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:27.409
for Leaven and Worth to determine that the
logic gap between improperly located cartesian

00:22:27.409 --> 00:22:31.060
coordinates, the theoretical ability for a
cube to be located between the shell and the

00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:35.559
main cube, and the sound and tremors, is that
the cubes might be moving and their might

00:22:35.559 --> 00:22:39.750
be a cube between the shell and the main cube
which could be an exit.

00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:46.909
Leaven misses all this and decodes their rooms
coordinates to x=19, y=26 and doesn’t bother

00:22:46.909 --> 00:22:48.260
with the z axis.

00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:51.770
She then announces that they are only 7 rooms
from the side.

00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:55.660
If you thought these numbers were the cartesian
coordinates of this room’s current location,

00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:58.850
wouldn’t it be common sense to go up.

00:22:58.850 --> 00:23:03.419
You don’t know which side is the x or z
axis, and you don’t know if you are going

00:23:03.419 --> 00:23:04.980
forward or reverse.

00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:10.409
You do know up from down and right now you
think you’re 26 from 27 total cubes.

00:23:10.409 --> 00:23:13.649
You should be at the edge or outside of the
main cube.

00:23:13.649 --> 00:23:14.649
Just go up.

00:23:14.649 --> 00:23:15.649
Pretty stupid.

00:23:15.649 --> 00:23:19.700
Regardless of where they actually are in the
cube, going topside will enable them to confirm

00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:25.400
the size of the cube, shell, space between
the cube and the shell, confirm if any cubes

00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:30.100
are between the cube and the shell, and give
them a view of 5 out of the 6 sides of the

00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:32.330
cube to identify an exit location.

00:23:32.330 --> 00:23:36.789
Logically, it makes sense that an exit would
not be on the bottom, because if one shell

00:23:36.789 --> 00:23:41.470
is 16 feet tall, and that’s the height of
the gap between the cube and the shell, you

00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:45.240
could drop down to the exit easily with a
clothing rope.

00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:51.820
Logically, they would put the exit in the
most difficult location, which is the roof.

00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:56.289
Traps are still a problem, but if it’s not
prime they can sniff, slap, and boot the room

00:23:56.289 --> 00:23:58.000
to cut the risk substantially.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:03.120
Eventually Leaven figures out these issues
when the next room has non-sequential coordinates

00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:05.570
of 14,27,14.

00:24:05.570 --> 00:24:08.260
This is an incredible piece to the puzzle
though.

00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:12.559
Before we could only speculate that a cube
could be outside the main cube, but this room

00:24:12.559 --> 00:24:16.490
is proof that a room could have cartesian
coordinates outside the shell.

00:24:16.490 --> 00:24:20.390
Knowing the door is at the shell, and the
cube would act as a bridge to it should be

00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:21.870
pretty obvious by this point.

00:24:21.870 --> 00:24:26.490
Still, what’s it doing here, obviously this
isn’t the top of the cube.

00:24:26.490 --> 00:24:31.730
The largest discrepancy they need to resolve
right now is why cartesian coordinates haven’t

00:24:31.730 --> 00:24:36.549
matched up with a cubes actual location, because
right now they have no idea where they actually

00:24:36.549 --> 00:24:37.769
are in the cube.

00:24:37.769 --> 00:24:42.139
After that, figure out why the trap detection
method worked then stopped working.

00:24:42.139 --> 00:24:46.850
Leaven has been finding abstract patterns
in the numbers left and right so far, I'm

00:24:46.850 --> 00:24:48.230
sure something will hit her.

00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:58.870
The crew disregards the top of the cube as
having any merits, and decides to go downwards?

00:24:58.870 --> 00:25:02.750
Holloway mentions that the edge seems to be
surrounded by traps.

00:25:02.750 --> 00:25:05.460
Quentin agrees and thinks they should cross
it anyways.

00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:10.610
They seem to think that every cube 1 from
the edge is trapped, but how could they possibly

00:25:10.610 --> 00:25:14.640
know this if they have no idea where they
are.

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:16.700
Going downwards is dumb anyways.

00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:22.250
With patience and wits running thin, they
decide to sneak across this cube’s sound

00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:24.779
activated shish kebab trap.

00:25:24.779 --> 00:25:29.480
Problem is, Kazan’s tourette syndrome could
cause the trap to activate once they are inside

00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:30.600
the cube.

00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:34.250
Personally, I'd put him in a previous room
and gag him with a t-shirt.

00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:37.720
Once everyone’s through, Holloway can then
bring Kazan across too.

00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:42.490
You better have good proprioception, if you
accidentally knee-knock the wall you’ll

00:25:42.490 --> 00:25:45.159
get run through seven ways to sunday.

00:25:45.159 --> 00:25:49.430
Leaven and Holloway both sneak through at
the same time, and Worth hops back in to help

00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:50.430
them.

00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:55.029
It’s really unnecessary and risky to have
so many people inside the cube at a time.

00:25:55.029 --> 00:26:00.289
Poor Kazan goes the wrong way, gets caught
on the door handle, and almost shrieks before

00:26:00.289 --> 00:26:14.159
Holloway jumps back and helps him out.

00:26:14.159 --> 00:26:24.700
Yah Kazan messed up and almost got you killed,
but why on Earth did you stop when you got

00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:25.950
to the corridor.

00:26:25.950 --> 00:26:28.240
You should have just jumped in the hatch immediately.

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:32.269
Holloway stops Quentin from beating the hell
out of Kazan for almost getting him killed,

00:26:32.269 --> 00:26:34.240
and a fight ensues between them.

00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:38.220
The fact that they are right next to the outside
of the cube diverts their attention.

00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:40.620
They open the door and, well, Worth was right.

00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:43.399
There’s a shell 1 cube from the main cube.

00:26:43.399 --> 00:26:48.309
It’s pretty dark, so they decide to fashion
a shirt rope to swing Holloway over and see

00:26:48.309 --> 00:26:52.059
if there’s anything out there since she’s
the lightest and they can’t risk Leaven’s

00:26:52.059 --> 00:26:53.059
life.

00:26:53.059 --> 00:26:56.130
What I don’t understand is why they all
support Holloway like they are playing tug

00:26:56.130 --> 00:26:57.130
of war.

00:26:57.130 --> 00:27:01.279
You could easily tie the clothing rope off
on any number of things in the cube while

00:27:01.279 --> 00:27:05.009
still holding on and bracing yourselves against
the hatchway entrance.

00:27:05.009 --> 00:27:10.360
This would remove the risk of you guys dropping
her and give Holloway more slack.

00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:12.231
Holloway tries to swing to the shell which
puts a lot of strain on the others, but I

00:27:12.231 --> 00:27:13.231
can’t really see why she tried this.

00:27:13.231 --> 00:27:15.399
She can clearly see that it’s just a solid
wall.

00:27:15.399 --> 00:27:18.330
If there’s a door, it’s probably not on
this side like Worth said.

00:27:18.330 --> 00:27:23.529
Whatever was making the noise at each interval
occurs again, causing a tremor that magically

00:27:23.529 --> 00:27:26.200
makes everyone release their grasp of the
rope.

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:38.129
Quentin is the only one that dives for the
rope to save Holloway from falling to death.

00:27:38.129 --> 00:27:46.740
Wow, that was cold as shit Quentin.

00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:50.120
Yah they had an argument earlier, but damn.

00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:54.700
I saw some people saying that Holloway should
have yelled something like, “He’s going

00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:58.659
to drop me on purpose, please stop him from
murdering me.”, but I doubt she could have

00:27:58.659 --> 00:28:00.820
gotten a word out before he dropped her.

00:28:00.820 --> 00:28:05.389
Quentin stupidly dropped the shirt rope too,
it’s not like that could be helpful on their

00:28:05.389 --> 00:28:06.389
journey.

00:28:06.389 --> 00:28:10.039
Worth and Leaven are suspicious, but they
don’t know for a fact he killed Holloway.

00:28:10.039 --> 00:28:14.679
Everyone’s pretty distraught and delirious
by now, so they decide to take a nap while

00:28:14.679 --> 00:28:22.190
listening to creepy ass theme music.

00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:31.769
Crazy-eyed Quentin absolutely loses it and
tries to take Leaven and leave everyone else

00:28:31.769 --> 00:28:32.769
behind.

00:28:32.769 --> 00:28:36.490
Worth and Kazan pursue Quentin and save her,
but Worth gets his ass kicked and booted into

00:28:36.490 --> 00:28:41.500
the next cube by Quentin in his illogical
search to find the bottom for an exit.

00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:46.419
To Quentin’s dismay, Worth starts laughing
maniacally, because the cube he was just pushed

00:28:46.419 --> 00:28:50.370
into contained none other than Renne’s corroded
corpse.

00:28:50.370 --> 00:28:53.070
At first glance it seems they’ve gone full
circle.

00:28:53.070 --> 00:28:54.970
But it should be obvious that they haven’t.

00:28:54.970 --> 00:28:58.809
They should know they haven’t backtracked
that much, and that currently they are right

00:28:58.809 --> 00:29:02.000
next to the edge of the cube, which wasn’t
the case earlier.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.549
It’s more likely that the rooms have been
moving like the inaccurate cartesian coordinates

00:29:06.549 --> 00:29:08.429
have been suggesting all along.

00:29:08.429 --> 00:29:13.590
I do want to point out that it is extremely
lucky that they managed to stumble back into

00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:18.350
the Rennes Room out of 17,576 moving rooms.

00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:21.419
To most of our protagonists, all hope seems
lost.

00:29:21.419 --> 00:29:24.070
But Worth realizes they haven’t gone full-circle.

00:29:24.070 --> 00:29:29.960
He cracks the door where the wrenster got
smoked, and yep, now it’s just open air.

00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:35.440
With the moving cubes puzzle piece, Leaven
is graced with another mathematical revelation.

00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:40.300
The cartesian coordinates are indicative of
the cubes starting positions.

00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:43.960
This solves the exit path problem.

00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:48.070
Theoretically and empirically we know that
some cubes have starting positions outside

00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:53.399
the main 26x26 cube, like the 14,27,14 cube.

00:29:53.399 --> 00:29:57.740
According to Worth and our observations, there
don’t appear to be any cubes that were situated

00:29:57.740 --> 00:29:59.279
outside the main cube.

00:29:59.279 --> 00:30:04.909
This indicates that the cubes with a 27 starting
location are rare, and possibly only the one

00:30:04.909 --> 00:30:06.840
they encountered exists.

00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:10.120
Also according to Worth, there is one door
on the shell.

00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:15.240
Since this rare or single cube with a 27 starting
coordinate would fit flush with the shell,

00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:19.600
it’s likely that it’s a bridge to the
shell where an exit would lie, but only when

00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:20.940
it’s in it’s starting position.

00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:25.240
Unfortunately, this exit path solution presents
more problems.

00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:29.340
How do they locate a cube when all the cubes
are being shuffled around and they only know

00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:31.250
their starting positions.

00:30:31.250 --> 00:30:35.160
Knowing that you can navigate a map using
permutations of cartesian coordinates, and

00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:40.050
since the numbers have been the key to everything
so far, Leaven and Worth figure that the permutations

00:30:40.050 --> 00:30:42.720
are encoded in these numbers as well.

00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:46.420
Leaven runs through some numbers and ideas
pretty quickly, so let’s break down what

00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:50.510
she’s thinking.

00:30:50.510 --> 00:30:55.559
She mentions that to find the starting cartesian
coordinates, you add the 3 digit number sequences

00:30:55.559 --> 00:31:00.120
together, to find the permutations, you subtract
the numbers from each other.

00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:06.860
Then she says that their current room moves
to 0,1,-1 on the x-axis.

00:31:06.860 --> 00:31:08.309
2,5,-7 on the y-axis.

00:31:08.309 --> 00:31:11.549
And 1,-1,0 on the z-axis.

00:31:11.549 --> 00:31:14.789
We can deduce the equation she’s using from
this.

00:31:14.789 --> 00:31:19.470
For example, with the room number 242 536
645.

00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:28.220
To decode the cartesian coordinate starting
position, you would do (2+4+2),(5+3+6),(6+4+5).

00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:29.820
This equals 8,14,15.

00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:35.130
Now, the permutation would be decoded by doing
the opposite, sort of.

00:31:35.130 --> 00:31:39.399
You would subtract each number from each other
in the 3 digit sequences, like this.

00:31:39.399 --> 00:31:40.399
((2-4)+(4-2)+(2-2)),((5-3)+(3-6)+(6-5)),((6-4)+(4-5)+(5-6))
which equals (-2,2,0), (2,-3,1),(2,-1,1).

00:31:40.399 --> 00:31:43.860
This seems to work because each set cancels
itself out to 0.

00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:47.000
Meaning that a cube’s starting and ending
positions are the same.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:51.809
To verify her theory, she needs to calculate
the permutations of surrounding cubes not

00:31:51.809 --> 00:31:56.279
only determine if they conflict or not, but
also to figure out where they are in the cycle

00:31:56.279 --> 00:32:00.889
and if they are on the z or x axis.

00:32:00.889 --> 00:32:02.269
How does this all work?

00:32:02.269 --> 00:32:03.830
I’ll try to explain.

00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:07.799
Leaven asks Worth and Quentin to give her
the room numbers of surrounding rooms as a

00:32:07.799 --> 00:32:09.050
reference point.

00:32:09.050 --> 00:32:11.789
These are the numbers and thus permutations
of the surrounding cubes:

00:32:11.789 --> 00:32:12.789
Worth Room #1: 666,897,466 or 18,24,16 or
(0,0,0) (-1,2,-1) (-2,0,2)

00:32:12.789 --> 00:32:13.789
Quentin Room #2: 567,898,545 or 18,25,14 or
(-1,-1,2) (-1,1,0) (1,-1,0)

00:32:13.789 --> 00:32:14.789
Worth Room #3: 656,778,462 or 17,22,12 or
(1,-1,0) (0,-1,1) (-2,4,-2)

00:32:14.789 --> 00:32:16.649
We aren’t given the room number of their
current room, but we are given the permutations,

00:32:16.649 --> 00:32:18.080
which are:

00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:21.840
(0,1,-1) (2,5,-7) (1,-1,0)

00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:27.129
And we are also told by Leaven that this room,
and in conjunction the Bridge Room, is 2 movements

00:32:27.129 --> 00:32:28.809
from it’s starting position.

00:32:28.809 --> 00:32:32.740
Before we continue, I want to point out that
the numbers provided here don’t strictly

00:32:32.740 --> 00:32:36.350
add up given the permutation decoding scheme.

00:32:36.350 --> 00:32:38.259
Either I and a bunch of other people are wrong..

00:32:38.259 --> 00:32:42.789
..there’s missing info, or the movie made
mistakes.

00:32:42.789 --> 00:32:46.950
It was incredibly frustrating to try to make
sense of it, but i’ll give you my train

00:32:46.950 --> 00:32:50.610
of thought and let you decide if I’m right
or missing something.

00:32:50.610 --> 00:32:51.610
I did mess up, the y and z axes should be
flipped.

00:32:51.610 --> 00:32:52.610
The Z should be the vertical axis...

00:32:52.610 --> 00:32:55.230
To reiterate: In order to verify her theory,
she needs to calculate the permutations of

00:32:55.230 --> 00:33:00.200
surrounding cubes not only determine if they
conflict or not, but also to figure out where

00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:04.049
they are in the cycle and if they are on the
z or x axis.

00:33:04.049 --> 00:33:06.159
The reference room data is as follows:

00:33:06.159 --> 00:33:07.159
Worth Room #1: 666,897,466 or 18,24,16 or
(0,0,0) (-1,2,-1) (-2,0,2)

00:33:07.159 --> 00:33:08.159
Starting Position: 18,24,16
First Position: 18,23,14

00:33:08.159 --> 00:33:09.159
Second Position: 18,25,14
Starting Position: 18,24,16

00:33:09.159 --> 00:33:10.159
Quentin Room #2: 567,898,545 or 18,25,14 or
(-1,-1,2) (-1,1,0) (1,-1,0)

00:33:10.159 --> 00:33:11.159
Starting Position: 18,25,14
First Position: 17,26,15

00:33:11.159 --> 00:33:12.159
Second Position: 16,25,14
Starting Position: 18,25,14

00:33:12.159 --> 00:33:13.159
Worth Room #3: 656,778,462 or 17,22,12 or
(1,-1,0) (0,-1,1) (-2,4,-2)

00:33:13.159 --> 00:33:14.159
Starting Position: 17,22,12
First Position: 18,22,10

00:33:14.159 --> 00:33:15.159
Second Position: 17,21,14
Starting Position: 17,22,12

00:33:15.159 --> 00:33:16.159
Current Room: X,X,X or 16,18,14 or (0,1,-1)
(2,5,-7) (1,-1,0)

00:33:16.159 --> 00:33:17.159
Starting Position: 16,18,14
First Position: 16,20,15

00:33:17.159 --> 00:33:18.159
Second Position: 17,25,14
Starting Position: 16,18,14

00:33:18.159 --> 00:33:19.159
Bare with me here.

00:33:19.159 --> 00:33:20.159
Like I said earlier, the numbers don’t make
sense in some spots.

00:33:20.159 --> 00:33:21.159
Worth Room #3 will never be on the same y-axis
as their current room, so this room should

00:33:21.159 --> 00:33:22.159
have different numbering.

00:33:22.159 --> 00:33:23.159
Likewise, none of these rooms will ever be
near the edge of the cube, but Worth was just

00:33:23.159 --> 00:33:25.899
seen next to an open door with nothing but
air outside.

00:33:25.899 --> 00:33:30.090
Anyways, to verify her permutation theory,
she would need to ensure that there are no

00:33:30.090 --> 00:33:35.419
conflicting permutations, where two cubes
would be in the same location at one time.

00:33:35.419 --> 00:33:36.820
This checks out thankfully.

00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:41.320
To figure out where in the cycle they are
at, she needs to basically find the coinciding

00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:44.929
permutations that line up on the x and y axis.

00:33:44.929 --> 00:33:50.690
Worth Room #1 and Quentin Room #2 both line
up on the same y-axis as their current room,

00:33:50.690 --> 00:33:55.299
and are also lined up on either side of their
current room on the x-axis when in the second

00:33:55.299 --> 00:33:56.590
position.

00:33:56.590 --> 00:34:02.070
Leaven even mentions the room number 17,25,14,
though she never told us what that meant,

00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:05.820
now we know that she’s referring to the
cartesian coordinates of the second position

00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:07.269
of their current room.

00:34:07.269 --> 00:34:12.550
She also mentions that the current room makes
2 more moves before returning to its original

00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:13.550
position.

00:34:13.550 --> 00:34:17.389
Which is a problem because according to our
figures, it should be in 1 move.

00:34:17.389 --> 00:34:21.990
There’s a second problem too, the current
room’s permutation and cartesian coordinates

00:34:21.990 --> 00:34:26.649
are also incompatible, there’s no way to
produce a compatible room number with both

00:34:26.649 --> 00:34:28.470
of these decoded sets.

00:34:28.470 --> 00:34:32.200
But theoretically this is how you would know
your current position in the cycle.

00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:36.280
Let’s say the movie screwed up and all this
should check out.

00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:40.780
They also need to orient themselves correctly,
so they need to know which direction is the

00:34:40.780 --> 00:34:44.210
x axis and z axis.

00:34:44.210 --> 00:34:48.860
Using our above calculations they would know
that the three rooms with sequential x-axis

00:34:48.860 --> 00:34:54.290
numbers would be the x-axis, and perpendicular
to it would be the z-axis.

00:34:54.290 --> 00:34:57.139
Now they are properly oriented within the
cube.

00:34:57.139 --> 00:35:01.859
Great, the decoding scheme seems to check
out if you ignore a lot of the problems with

00:35:01.859 --> 00:35:02.859
it.

00:35:02.859 --> 00:35:03.859
Funny how that works.

00:35:03.859 --> 00:35:07.040
If you have problems just ignore them and
everything will check out.

00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:11.240
With their current location and orientation,
they should be able to find the bridge room,

00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:12.240
right?

00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:14.200
Yes, but for the wrong reasons.

00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:17.520
The numbers continue to break down and give
us more problems.

00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:20.440
Here is what we can decode from the bridge
room cartesian coordinates.

00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:21.440
Bridge Room: X,999,X or 14,27,14 or (X) (0,0,0)
(X)

00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:22.440
Starting Position: 14,27,14
First Position: X,27,X

00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:23.440
Second Position: X,27,X
Starting Position: 14,27,14

00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:26.990
The only way to express 27 as a room number
sequence is 999, and the permutation for that

00:35:26.990 --> 00:35:35.240
would be ((9-9)+(9-9)+(9-9)) which equals
a movement cycle of 0,0,0.

00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:40.220
This means the bridge cube wouldn’t move
from its starting position on the y axis,

00:35:40.220 --> 00:35:43.200
which means they would have never encountered
it from inside the cube.

00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:47.990
If they did somehow stumble into the bridge
room, based on this permutation encoding scheme,

00:35:47.990 --> 00:35:49.809
it would be impossible not to notice.

00:35:49.809 --> 00:35:54.300
They’d be surrounded by air on 4 sides,
the ceiling on the top, and the cube they

00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:55.480
entered from on the bottom.

00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:57.510
They don’t really need to know though.

00:35:57.510 --> 00:36:01.470
Now that they are oriented on the z and x
axis and have their current location, they

00:36:01.470 --> 00:36:07.520
can accurately move to the adjacent cubes
next to 14,27,14’s starting position and

00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:08.520
wait for it.

00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:14.369
At their assumed current position of 17,25,14,
this puts them 3 cubes away on the x-axis,

00:36:14.369 --> 00:36:19.010
and 1 cube away on the y-axis from the cube
that will be adjacent to the bridge cube in

00:36:19.010 --> 00:36:20.270
it’s starting position.

00:36:20.270 --> 00:36:22.619
But wait, there’s more problems.

00:36:22.619 --> 00:36:26.430
They have no idea what the movement timing
and sequence is.

00:36:26.430 --> 00:36:31.200
From my calculations based on movie timing,
a cube moves every 4 minutes or so, and the

00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:34.730
late-wrenster said that they were regular
intervals each time.

00:36:34.730 --> 00:36:38.569
However, this could just be the movements
that they were able to notice from their position

00:36:38.569 --> 00:36:40.040
inside the cube.

00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:42.470
Cubes could have been moving that they weren’t
able to feel.

00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:47.890
We know not all cubes move at the same time,
and likely only a couple cube moves at a time.

00:36:47.890 --> 00:36:51.630
The entire time they have been in the cube,
they haven’t been inside a cube that was

00:36:51.630 --> 00:36:52.630
moving.

00:36:52.630 --> 00:36:56.460
This means that independent cubes, like their
current cube and the fantastical bridge room

00:36:56.460 --> 00:36:59.079
will likely be at different stages in their
rotations.

00:36:59.079 --> 00:37:00.809
It gets worse.

00:37:00.809 --> 00:37:05.520
According to her permutation theory, each
cube could move a minimum of 3 times, and

00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:09.130
a maximum of 9 times before returning to the
starting position.

00:37:09.130 --> 00:37:15.060
However, these could be executed forwards,
in reverse, one axis at a time, multiple axis

00:37:15.060 --> 00:37:17.569
at a time, and any combination thereof.

00:37:17.569 --> 00:37:22.730
With all this shitty incongruent math, and
considering they may be 3 cubes across and

00:37:22.730 --> 00:37:26.520
1 cube under where they need to be, I'd just
go topside and wait for the bridge cube to

00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:29.900
get into position, then break open the side
doors and hop in.

00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:33.700
They need to head topside to get to the bridge
anyways, so why stick around doing more math

00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:34.700
problems.

00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:38.270
They already know where the puck is going,
just stake in that direction.

00:37:38.270 --> 00:37:42.030
Instead, they obsess over the slightly faulty
trap detection method.

00:37:42.030 --> 00:37:47.130
4 cubes away isn’t a problem, with the immensely
high probability of correct trap detection,

00:37:47.130 --> 00:37:53.790
and their current method of no-prime, sniff,
slap, and boot, it shouldn’t be a problem.

00:37:53.790 --> 00:38:01.760
Okay.. re-evaluating trap detection theory
still isn’t necessary, but screw it let's

00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:03.000
do it.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:07.720
Leaven says that at first she thought trap
rooms were identified if any 3 digit sequence

00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:12.599
in the room number was a prime number, but
now she thinks trapped rooms are identified

00:38:12.599 --> 00:38:16.000
based on numbers that are the power of a prime.

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:18.100
What led her to believe that?

00:38:18.100 --> 00:38:20.030
This doesn’t even make any sense.

00:38:20.030 --> 00:38:24.349
I swear to god, at this point I think she’s
just making shit up to sound relevant.

00:38:24.349 --> 00:38:29.599
When pressured by Quentin to figure out the
numbers so they can escape she retorts:

00:38:29.599 --> 00:38:35.780
So you can’t calculate the factors in each
set of numbers to assess whether or not a

00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:40.880
room is trapped, but somehow you know that
this is the solution for trap detection?

00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:41.880
Okay.

00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:46.540
The problem is that prime numbers and products
of prime powers are different sets of numbers.

00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:49.790
A product of a prime power can’t be prime
itself.

00:38:49.790 --> 00:38:54.520
So if traps were only identified by prime
powers their previous trap detection method

00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:56.240
wouldn’t have worked so well.

00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:58.380
Prime powers are composite numbers.

00:38:58.380 --> 00:39:02.500
For example 5x5x5=125.

00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:06.190
This is the product of a prime power, but
it also is a composite number.

00:39:06.190 --> 00:39:11.290
My guess is that Leaven meant that traps are
detected if the number is prime OR a product

00:39:11.290 --> 00:39:12.490
of a prime power.

00:39:12.490 --> 00:39:14.970
Come on Leaven, be clear for Christ's sake.

00:39:14.970 --> 00:39:18.940
The pain continues as my confusion is reignited
yet again.

00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:24.571
When Leaven says she can’t even calculate
the factors of 567, Kazan blurts out the number

00:39:24.571 --> 00:39:25.571
2.

00:39:25.571 --> 00:39:26.571
Which is odd.

00:39:26.571 --> 00:39:29.270
So She asks him again, to which he replies
2, again.

00:39:29.270 --> 00:39:33.819
He has a habit of repeating words, so she
then throws him a tee-ball number that she

00:39:33.819 --> 00:39:36.569
can verify which has an answer different than
2.

00:39:36.569 --> 00:39:40.869
So she asks, how many factors does 30 have,
he says 3.

00:39:40.869 --> 00:39:44.160
Worth then gives Kazan the rest of the numbers
to the next room.

00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:48.080
Kazan answers that 898 is 2 and 545 is 2.

00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:51.609
Leaven gasps, “he’s giving us the factors”.

00:39:51.609 --> 00:39:52.690
Except he’s not.

00:39:52.690 --> 00:39:56.400
He’s giving you the number of unique prime
factors.

00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:59.530
For example: 567 has 10 factors.

00:39:59.530 --> 00:40:04.500
1, 3, 7, 9, 21, 27, 63, 81, 189, 567.

00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:07.619
The unique prime factors would be 3 and 7.

00:40:07.619 --> 00:40:08.720
2 numbers total.

00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:12.870
2 is a prime number and doesn’t indicate
if a room is the product of a prime power

00:40:12.870 --> 00:40:13.870
either.

00:40:13.870 --> 00:40:14.870
I don’t get it.

00:40:14.870 --> 00:40:17.770
I probably just suck at math and don’t understand
something though.

00:40:17.770 --> 00:40:22.390
Leaven’s not communicating clearly, and
she’s only relying on a savant to compute

00:40:22.390 --> 00:40:25.020
things based on the muddy context she provided.

00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:29.490
Autistic savant’s like Kazan often have
an extraordinary area of knowledge or ability

00:40:29.490 --> 00:40:34.680
in a single capacity, but otherwise have immense
trouble with understanding things like language.

00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:37.339
So for him to understand what she’s saying
is unlikely.

00:40:37.339 --> 00:40:39.380
Hell, I can’t either.

00:40:39.380 --> 00:40:43.650
Leaven says that based on Kazan’s answers,
the next room is safe.

00:40:43.650 --> 00:40:46.380
You’re not even going to check his math
at all?

00:40:46.380 --> 00:40:50.670
Even if you did, like your prime number theory,
you don’t know if it works with any degree

00:40:50.670 --> 00:40:51.670
of confidence.

00:40:51.670 --> 00:40:56.750
Hell, there is even less confidence that this
method works versus the previous method, and

00:40:56.750 --> 00:40:58.510
now you don’t have a boot to test it.

00:40:58.510 --> 00:41:02.740
I’d just continue with the old method that
had a high confidence and success rate.

00:41:02.740 --> 00:41:06.549
Technically you could go back and test the
rooms you already know are safe, but since

00:41:06.549 --> 00:41:10.220
you didn’t use line markers you probably
forgot which ones were safe.

00:41:10.220 --> 00:41:14.740
I guess you could also use Rennes corpse as
a ‘boot’ to test the next rooms.

00:41:14.740 --> 00:41:16.730
Or you can just throw Worth in I guess.

00:41:16.730 --> 00:41:19.910
They are going in the Quentin #2 room direction.

00:41:19.910 --> 00:41:23.609
According to our previous calculations, this
is the right direction if they are heading

00:41:23.609 --> 00:41:25.020
towards the bridge room.

00:41:25.020 --> 00:41:28.730
They then progress further into the 15,25,14.

00:41:28.730 --> 00:41:41.180
When Quentin tries to follow them, Worth shoves
the door up into Quentin’s neck.

00:41:41.180 --> 00:41:48.200
There’s that crazy-eyed Quentin.

00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:53.260
Worth stalls Quentin while Kazan and Leaven
try to escape into the 14,25,14 room.

00:41:53.260 --> 00:41:56.690
They should head upwards now, but instead
move forward another cube.

00:41:56.690 --> 00:42:00.940
But i’m sure Leaven magically figured out
some other decoding scheme and knows where

00:42:00.940 --> 00:42:02.280
the bridge room is.

00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:07.250
Their next move is trapped though, so to throw
Quentin off their tail they stage their own

00:42:07.250 --> 00:42:09.930
trap.

00:42:09.930 --> 00:42:14.400
That’s clever and all, but super impractical.

00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:18.470
You have to make sure that Quentin steps on
top of the door, then when you try to open

00:42:18.470 --> 00:42:22.730
the door it will make noise and it has to
come out then slide over.

00:42:22.730 --> 00:42:24.710
It just wouldn’t really work.

00:42:24.710 --> 00:42:27.720
Movie magic says otherwise and Quentin fell
on his head.

00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:31.400
With the amount of blood coming out of his
head, I think they’re safe from him now.

00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:37.920
From their 14,25,14 room, they move across
the z and x axis a few times and reach a giant

00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:40.890
vertical shaft where cubes should be.

00:42:40.890 --> 00:42:45.150
They’ve positioned themselves 1 cube across
from where the bridge cube’s next position

00:42:45.150 --> 00:42:46.150
will be.

00:42:46.150 --> 00:42:51.619
The bridge cube comes down to their cube,
and they hop in to ride it to the pearly gates.

00:42:51.619 --> 00:42:57.470
Interestingly, this cube moved down, then
back up, suggesting that the cubes immediately

00:42:57.470 --> 00:43:02.700
moved a full cycle across one axis before
rotating across the other axis.

00:43:02.700 --> 00:43:07.250
There was no way of knowing this so finding
the bridge cube again is highly improbable.

00:43:07.250 --> 00:43:11.870
Kazan failed to make the jump in time, and
Leavenworth’s cube moved up 1 spot.

00:43:11.870 --> 00:43:16.010
Worth graciously comes to Kazan’s rescue
by going left then down.

00:43:16.010 --> 00:43:18.609
Which doesn’t make sense either.

00:43:18.609 --> 00:43:22.799
While Worth is hauling Kazan’s ass back,
Leaven checks the room number of their current

00:43:22.799 --> 00:43:24.020
room.

00:43:24.020 --> 00:43:26.480
It’s 14,26,14.

00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:30.640
Then she says this room’s next move takes
them under the bridge room.

00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:35.240
So this isn’t the bridge room, this was
the room that cycles next to the bridge room.

00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:39.210
How are you calculating the timing of all
these rotations anyways.

00:43:39.210 --> 00:43:44.119
I’m having a hard freaking time believing
and following this.

00:43:44.119 --> 00:43:49.849
More like you should have gone topside as
soon as Worth told you about the cube and

00:43:49.849 --> 00:43:53.060
you had discovered the 14,27,14 room.

00:43:53.060 --> 00:43:57.041
Once their cube’s movement is complete they
go across it and open the other side’s door

00:43:57.041 --> 00:43:58.041
to the bridge cube.

00:43:58.041 --> 00:43:59.041
Wouldn’t they be under the bridge cube,
meaning they’d have to go upwards to get

00:43:59.041 --> 00:44:00.041
to the bridge?

00:44:00.041 --> 00:44:01.041
And once inside the bridge cube, wouldn’t
the exit be on the roof as the bridge cube

00:44:01.041 --> 00:44:02.041
can never be near any sides?

00:44:02.041 --> 00:44:03.041
I swear to god I must be losing my shit.

00:44:03.041 --> 00:44:06.910
Before when Leaven came across the 14,27,14
room it was white, and now it’s red?

00:44:06.910 --> 00:44:11.630
What are you all waiting for, freaking go,
these cubes move fast and you’re going to

00:44:11.630 --> 00:44:12.839
miss your only chance.

00:44:12.839 --> 00:44:18.089
Oh great now he’s sitting down.

00:44:18.089 --> 00:44:24.030
Oh here we go again with the Edgar Allan Poe
bs.

00:44:24.030 --> 00:44:28.230
The only stupidity I'm seeing here is that
the dumbass that helped build this thing is

00:44:28.230 --> 00:44:31.630
now giving up 2 yards from the endzone.

00:44:31.630 --> 00:44:37.750
Fine dude cya later.

00:44:37.750 --> 00:44:39.280
No.

00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:40.810
No.

00:44:40.810 --> 00:44:42.339
No.

00:44:42.339 --> 00:44:44.720
That’s not possible.

00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:45.720
1.

00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:48.619
This dude's head was busted open and bleeding
all over from the fall.

00:44:48.619 --> 00:44:49.619
2.

00:44:49.619 --> 00:44:52.670
With his lack of knowledge of math he’d
have definitely run into trap rooms

00:44:52.670 --> 00:44:53.670
3.

00:44:53.670 --> 00:44:58.020
Leaven, Worth and Kazan not only moved across
numerous cubes, but also those cubes they

00:44:58.020 --> 00:45:02.079
moved into moved far distances 2 times as
well.

00:45:02.079 --> 00:45:06.990
This epitomizes the incongruency I've been
struggling to make sense of this whole movie.

00:45:06.990 --> 00:45:11.110
Worth doesn’t allow Quentin to go free,
and holds his leg so Quentin gets caught in

00:45:11.110 --> 00:45:12.670
between the moving cubes.

00:45:12.670 --> 00:45:17.109
Kazan is the only one that makes it out alive,
though we can’t be sure.

00:45:17.109 --> 00:45:19.440
The light at the end of the tunnel might be
a train and all.

00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:21.090
The movie ends.

00:45:21.090 --> 00:45:24.730
Lets recap to see who could have lived or
was destined to die.

00:45:24.730 --> 00:45:28.430
This has been a long ass video so let me be
brief.

00:45:28.430 --> 00:45:30.299
Alderson couldn’t have survived.

00:45:30.299 --> 00:45:32.700
The Rennes couldn’t have survived.

00:45:32.700 --> 00:45:36.470
Everyone else shouldn’t have survived, and
only did so because of plot math.

00:45:36.470 --> 00:45:38.819
My soul didn’t survive.

00:45:38.819 --> 00:45:43.380
Movies that rely on details then screw those
details up are extremely frustrating.

00:45:43.380 --> 00:45:47.820
How dare they not accommodate YouTubers that
over analyze their low budget pseudo math

00:45:47.820 --> 00:45:48.820
dramas.

00:45:48.820 --> 00:45:53.210
I’d say that due to all the failure and
incongruencies, this movie wasn’t beaten.

00:45:53.210 --> 00:45:56.119
That’s the first time I've said a movie
can’t be beaten.

00:45:56.119 --> 00:45:59.260
Bravo Cube 1997, and fuck you.

00:45:59.260 --> 00:46:02.820
I’d rather take my chances in a zombie apocalypse
any day.

00:46:02.820 --> 00:46:07.880
I know there are cube sequels but I need to
let these wounds heal by doing a dumb movie

00:46:07.880 --> 00:46:08.880
next.

00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:10.660
So let me know what dumb movies you want to
see.

00:46:10.660 --> 00:46:15.280
Thanks for watching, and remember, be nice
to nerds.
