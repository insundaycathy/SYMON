feeling he admires the flower from his car&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:25.040
the following day david enters the gym and finds&nbsp;
the whole team gathering skip seems to be telling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:30.240
his teammates what happened the night before david&nbsp;
confronts jennifer according to him she should not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.000
change the ways of pleasantville and introduce&nbsp;
their peers to things from the real world&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:39.040
she disagrees and says that the town should know&nbsp;
about the things that could make them happy while&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.920
david figures a way to contact the old repairman&nbsp;
through the tv jennifer continues to have the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:49.120
town under her charm and influence gradually some&nbsp;
areas of pleasantville change from black and white&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.840
to color including mundane things and the faces&nbsp;
of people who experience new bursts of emotion&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.400
citizens begin to grow suspicious as&nbsp;
colors continuously appear around town&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:04.800
one casual afternoon betty asks jennifer what&nbsp;
happens at lover's lane jennifer hesitates to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:10.160
introduce the concept of making love to betty but&nbsp;
awkwardly she goes on to tell her what it is betty&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:15.360
tells her that george their father would never&nbsp;
do something like that however betty instructs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:20.880
that there are other ways to pleasure herself that&nbsp;
night in the bathtub she does what jennifer taught&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:26.640
as she touches herself she sees color oddly the&nbsp;
tree in their front yard starts to burst in flames&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.960
however fire isn't something that&nbsp;
exists in the world of pleasantville&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:35.600
david calls the firefighters but they have&nbsp;
no idea what to do he takes the lead in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:41.680
minimizing the fire as a result of this the&nbsp;
mayor big bob awards him a medal of bravery&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:46.800
after the ceremony margaret a schoolmate&nbsp;
approaches him and gives her the cookies she baked&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:52.800

girl including the real world in the diner david&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:57.040
enters as he is ready for work he finds out that&nbsp;
other teenagers are waiting for him to arrive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:03.200
they ask about how he knew about putting off&nbsp;
fires where he used to live and so on his stories&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:08.480
amaze the ones at the diner he even introduces&nbsp;
literature to them storytelling the famous novel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:13.760
the adventures of huckleberry finn upon telling&nbsp;
the story the once empty pages of the book begin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:19.120

previously black and white objects and people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:24.320
start to develop full and vibrant colors&nbsp;
only the town fathers remain unchanged the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:29.280
group is led by the mayor big bob who sees the&nbsp;
changes as a threat to pleasantville's values&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:33.840
he proposes an idea to george about implementing&nbsp;
rules by offering him a position in the council&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:38.160
george calls betty to greet the mayor but&nbsp;
she hides in the kitchen as she starts to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:43.440
turn chromatic david sees her crying and tries to&nbsp;
help by applying makeup on her face turning her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:49.280

a book of paintings he starts to browse through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:54.240
historical and iconic paintings through the years&nbsp;
this sparks a new interest and passion in him

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:01.680
for the first time david gathers his courage to&nbsp;
ask a girl out he approaches margaret to date&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:07.040
with him to which she agrees he runs back home&nbsp;
happily until he sees the old repairman ready&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:12.160
to communicate again after initially wanting to&nbsp;
leave david feels a sense of belonging he lacked&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:17.920
in the real world the repairman berates him for&nbsp;
altering the show so much david turns off the tv&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:21.040
relinquishing his ability to go home&nbsp;
to the real world in the process&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:25.680
david drives with margaret to lover's&nbsp;
lane and flowers begin to bloom in color&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:30.720
giving them a magical view the spot is entirely&nbsp;
in color as lovers surround the famous area

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:39.120
meanwhile betty takes a stroll around town she&nbsp;
stumbles upon one of bill's paintings displayed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:44.720
outside his diner this catches her attention&nbsp;
making her go inside she sees bill painting&nbsp;&nbsp;

the book that david also known as bud got for him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:55.360
bill realizes that betty is now colored&nbsp;
and tells her that she is beautiful&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:58.800
the both of them have a romantic moment&nbsp;
but they know that their love is forbidden
