00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:06.880
Hi, Mystery Recapped here. Today I’m going&nbsp;
to explain an episode from an American adult&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:12.080
animated anthology “Love, Death &amp;&nbsp;
Robots” called “The Drowned Giant”
&nbsp;

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.800
At the beginning of the episode, three scientists&nbsp;
drive to a beach while one of them named Steven&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:30.400
narrates about a naked dead giant. The day&nbsp;
before, a massive storm had hit the sea&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.840
which washed up a dead body of a giant to the&nbsp;
shore. The surprised local fishermen contacted&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:42.080
the officials who at first refused to believe such&nbsp;
atrocious news. But as people began to visit the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:47.600
beach and return back with crazy stories, the&nbsp;
scientists decided to go see for themselves.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.160
And so, Steven and his colleagues, who thought&nbsp;
that everyone was just bluffing about the dead&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:58.480
giant, now stand before him. A crowd surrounds the&nbsp;
corpse, scared to touch it before being absolutely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:04.000
sure that it’s safe. Steven’s colleagues guess&nbsp;
that the man weighs anywhere around eighty tons.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Steven narrates that the vast proportion of his&nbsp;
features makes it difficult for them to figure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.040
out his age, but looking at the giant’s defined&nbsp;
nose and mouth, he believes that he had been a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:19.040
young man with a modest temper. The three go&nbsp;
around the giant's body inspecting him. Steven&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:24.080
sees a pool of water that had been collected in&nbsp;
the corpse’s palm where tiny fishes swim. 
&nbsp;

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.920
Steven says that beyond the size of the giant, the&nbsp;
simple fact that he exists surprises him the most.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.160
He compares the giant’s existence to the crowd&nbsp;
on the beach and concludes that they are just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:40.160
imperfect and puny copies of him. As Steven looks&nbsp;
at the creature mesmerized, his colleague climbs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:45.600
on top of the corpse’s chest and waves towards the&nbsp;
crowd indicating that it is safe to come near it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.480
The people run towards him while cheering and&nbsp;
climb on top. Some of them comment that the body&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:56.080
is rubbery and bouncy. Children start playing&nbsp;
on his chest, trashing it with their shoes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.320
Steven, however, doesn’t touch or climb on&nbsp;
it. He and his colleagues stare at the giant&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.280
from afar while writing on their notes. As time&nbsp;
passes by, the people get enough of playing with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.800
the dead giants, and everyone returns home. 
After three days, Steven visits the beach again.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.120
Because of his growing interest in the giant,&nbsp;
his facility assigns him the role of keeping tabs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.160
on it. Steven claims that he wasn’t morbid about&nbsp;
keeping an eye on a dead person because, for him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.200
the giant was more alive than the people around&nbsp;
him. He watches as kids play slide on the corpse’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.560
chest, and some workers plan to butcher his femur&nbsp;
bone. The corpse has become public property. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.600
following day, Steven deliberately postponed&nbsp;
his visit to the beach until late afternoon,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:39.200
so no one would be around. When he gets there, the&nbsp;
corpse looks in bad form and has started to decay.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.200
A teenage girl sits comfortably on&nbsp;
the giant’s ear, using it as a chair.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.560
Steven notices that the giant’s face has a much&nbsp;
less youthful look than it was before. He assumes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.240
it is because of prolonged immersion in seawater&nbsp;
and tumefaction of tissue. As a crab crawls out of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:58.240
the giant’s mouth, the scientist claims that&nbsp;
it won’t be long until he decays fully.
&nbsp;

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.640
Steven finally gets the courage to set&nbsp;
foot on the corpse. Atop his chest,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.840
he sees a sandcastle someone had built. Then, his&nbsp;
other arm comes into view, showing us that half&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:13.120
of it has already decayed and whatever remained&nbsp;
of it has been taken away by people. Meanwhile,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:19.600
his cornea has become hazy and cloudy, which gives&nbsp;
his eyes a whirlpool effect. Steven looks at them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.720
saying that the giants’ suffering is less&nbsp;
tragic than this isolation that he is facing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:30.080
The next time he visits the giant, both his arms&nbsp;
and one of his legs have decayed and been cut.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.320
Steven walks around looking at the corpse,&nbsp;
which had been vandalized by teens who spray&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.880
paint insults on his body. He is reluctant to&nbsp;
witness the end of the magnificent creature,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.200
but the insults make him feel that the creature&nbsp;
is more human because it seems more vulnerable to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.840
him now. When Steven comes to the beach the&nbsp;
following day, he is almost relieved to see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:53.600
that the corpse’s head has been removed. Birds&nbsp;
eat its flesh as Steven watches it from afar.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.840
Without the head, the corpse looked less&nbsp;
human, which reduces Steven’s relationship&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.080
with the corpse that he had formed. 
After that day, he doesn’t visit the beach for a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.880
few weeks. On his next journey, he witnesses that&nbsp;
any feature indicating that the corpse was once&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:13.040
human has vanished. The only thing that remains is&nbsp;
the decaying gut of the once magnificent creature.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:18.560
By now, the interest of the crowd in the giant has&nbsp;
expired. Months later, after the giant’s arrival&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.920
has been forgotten, various pieces of his body can&nbsp;
be seen around town—especially his bones, which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:29.760
are used as decorations. While cycling one day,&nbsp;
Steven notices the giant’s skull lying abandoned.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.560
He believes that if he looks around the town’s&nbsp;
pubs, he will find mummified noses and ears&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:39.920
as well. According to Steven, these decorations&nbsp;
convey the giant’s greatness better than Steven’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:44.960
memory of his bloated and decaying appendages. 
As for the giant’s genitals, it is shown that it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:50.560
had been cut off and placed in the freak museum&nbsp;
in a circus. Steven narrates that the apparatus&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:56.560
occupies a whole tent to itself but is sadly&nbsp;
mislabeled as belonging to a whale. At last,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:02.160
the scientist says that the people who saw the&nbsp;
giant remember him as only a sea monster. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:07.520
for him, the giant is still alive, and he often&nbsp;
dreams of his resurrection. In his dreams,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:12.080
the giant strides through the town picking up his&nbsp;
fragments on his return journey to the sea.
&nbsp;

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:17.120
The episode, although short, has a deep and&nbsp;
metaphorical meaning in every scene. 
&nbsp;

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.760
The fans of the episode have interpreted it&nbsp;
their own way, but many believe that the narrator&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:27.200
Steven, is the giant himself. Steven feels the&nbsp;
pain of the dead giant when no one else can.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:32.000
So, some fans think that steven and the giant&nbsp;
are the same people. The giant might be trying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.800
to communicate through steven. Moreover, the way&nbsp;
Steven describes several stages of the decaying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:41.600
of the corpse in such detail makes one wonder&nbsp;
if he is the one going through the stages. 
&nbsp;

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:46.240
The decaying of the giant’s corpse is also seen&nbsp;
as a metaphor for several things. The narrator,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:51.760
Steven, observes the decaying of the corpse very&nbsp;
closely at every stage. First, he sees the process&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:56.800
that was supposed to happen, that is his body&nbsp;
decaying by the passage of time, then he notices&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:01.280
people starting to amputate the corpse treating&nbsp;
it as a commodity. And the way humans treat him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:06.240
poorly showed him the extent of consumerism and&nbsp;
exploitation that is considered normal in today’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:11.520
world. As the story progresses, Steven begins&nbsp;
to question what it means to be human and when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:16.160
do we decide that we have lost humanity.
Until the corpse had a head, he thought of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:20.240
it as a human just like him and the others&nbsp;
around him. In fact, he believed that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:25.040
giant was more of a human than tiny creatures&nbsp;
like himself. However, after Steven’s sympathy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:29.920
towards the giant dropped when he saw him only&nbsp;
as a mass of flesh. Throughout the episode,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:34.880
we do not know who the giant is or where&nbsp;
he came from, rather, “The Drowned Giant”&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:39.920
focuses more on the contrast of Steven and&nbsp;
other people’s feelings towards the giant. 
&nbsp;

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:44.720
In the book itself, J.G. Ballard concludes with&nbsp;
the detail about the giant’s appendage being&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:50.000
displayed in a circus. This is to emphasize how&nbsp;
much the giant was humiliated, although being a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.040
greater existence than them all. It also denotes&nbsp;
human’s superficial and exploitative nature.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:55.600 --> 00:07:00.400
Moreover, his genitals were labeled to be of a&nbsp;
whale’s, and his bones were mere decorations for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:06.160
the people. Here, it is clear that the giant has&nbsp;
been completely stripped of his humanity. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:11.360
Steven describes the genitals and decorated bones&nbsp;
as the only things that convey how magnificent of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:16.160
a being the giant was. Although he loves and&nbsp;
remembers the creature more than anyone else,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:20.320
he believes that his memory of his decaying&nbsp;
body would have never conveyed his greatness&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:23.840
as his preserved body parts do.
The giant was just a myth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:28.160
before being washed up to the shore. People&nbsp;
experienced his arrival for a short while,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:34.560
but forgot about him soon, turning his existence&nbsp;
into a myth again. We humans, like the giant,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:38.720
will someday fade away and remain only&nbsp;
in the memories of the people we met.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:44.160
But eventually, those memories will fade&nbsp;
as well and we simply cease to exist.
