00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.110 align:start position:0%
reassigned to Chantal and Hutch I guess
right<00:02:16.560><c> I</c><00:02:16.620><c> think</c><00:02:16.800><c> you've</c><00:02:17.129><c> lost</c><00:02:17.400><c> faith</c><00:02:17.700><c> after</c>

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 align:start position:0%
right I think you've lost faith after
 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.210 align:start position:0%
right I think you've lost faith after
several<00:02:18.599><c> failed</c><00:02:18.840><c> attempts</c><00:02:19.319><c> on</c><00:02:19.530><c> the</c><00:02:19.560><c> Todd</c><00:02:19.890><c> side</c>

several failed attempts on the Todd side
 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.210 align:start position:0%
several failed attempts on the Todd side
so<00:02:20.940><c> that</c><00:02:21.110><c> suggests</c><00:02:22.110><c> that</c><00:02:22.290><c> he's</c><00:02:22.530><c> got</c><00:02:22.709><c> Todd</c><00:02:22.920><c> onto</c>

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 align:start position:0%
so that suggests that he's got Todd onto
 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.640 align:start position:0%
so that suggests that he's got Todd onto

00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:16.540 align:start position:0%
think that he might be just he needs to
 

00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:19.260 align:start position:0%

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:19.270 align:start position:0%
go to the hospital right yeah probably
 

00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:22.110 align:start position:0%
go to the hospital right yeah probably
alive<00:14:19.960><c> but</c><00:14:20.320><c> if</c><00:14:20.860><c> he's</c><00:14:21.280><c> not</c><00:14:21.460><c> some</c><00:14:21.790><c> people</c><00:14:21.940><c> have</c>

00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:22.120 align:start position:0%
alive but if he's not some people have
 

00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
alive but if he's not some people have
suggested<00:14:22.270><c> that</c><00:14:22.660><c> that</c><00:14:23.170><c> might</c><00:14:23.350><c> be</c><00:14:23.530><c> what</c><00:14:23.680><c> it</c>

00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:23.770 align:start position:0%
suggested that that might be what it
 

00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:25.200 align:start position:0%
suggested that that might be what it
takes<00:14:23.980><c> to</c><00:14:24.100><c> get</c><00:14:24.190><c> Audrey</c><00:14:24.550><c> back</c><00:14:24.580><c> to</c><00:14:24.850><c> Twin</c><00:14:25.060><c> Peaks</c>

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:25.210 align:start position:0%
takes to get Audrey back to Twin Peaks
 

00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:28.500 align:start position:0%
takes to get Audrey back to Twin Peaks
so<00:14:25.740><c> maybe</c><00:14:26.740><c> sort</c><00:14:27.280><c> of</c><00:14:27.430><c> hoping</c><00:14:27.850><c> that</c><00:14:27.910><c> he's</c><00:14:28.240><c> not</c>

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:28.510 align:start position:0%
so maybe sort of hoping that he's not
 

00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:30.600 align:start position:0%
so maybe sort of hoping that he's not
