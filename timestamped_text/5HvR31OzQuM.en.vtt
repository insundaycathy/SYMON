00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:01.630
Welcome to Moviecaps.

00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:07.240
Today I will show you a Sci-fi, Drama, Thriller
film from 2017, titled The Circle.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.240
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.760
Watch out and take care.

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.420
Mae Holland is on a kayak in the middle of
a lake.

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:18.050
Her phone rings but she ignores it and continues
what seems to be her favorite hobby.

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.910
We are then introduced to her typical day
of work at a water company, answering calls

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:23.599
of angry customers.

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:28.109
Her exhausting day is far from being over
as her car breaks on her way back home.

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.369
She calls her friend Mercer, who is a handy
guy, helping her fix her car.

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.680
Despite his successful job at fixing the car,
his attempt of inviting Mae for a dinner that

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.120
night turns out to be a failure.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.240
Once home, Mae is having dinner with her parents
who are pretty fond of Mercer and definitely

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.080
not shy to suggest that they should be a couple.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.570
Much to their dismay, Mae is not welcoming
the idea.

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.470
Another aspect of Mae’s family is shown
during this dinner: Mae’s dad has Multiple

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.230
Sclerosis and it is not covered by insurance.

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.920
“Another day, another opportunity”, a
saying that was pretty literal for Mae, as

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.089
in the midst of yet another hectic day, she
got a call from her friend Annie, saying that

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:08.480
the company she’s working for is hiring
up to a hundred people and that Mae should

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.460
take the interview the next day.

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.000
Ex-Hermione was delighted to hear the news
and so she excitedly headed to The Circle

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.240
the following day for the interview.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.010
Your typical interview?

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:19.030
Not really.

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.650
But Mae was able to make it through and is
now part of The Circle customer experience

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:23.650
team.

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:28.030
Annie then introduces Mae to the many facilities
the company has, from headquarters of different

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.049
departments to leisure and sports.

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:34.620
Mae is pretty surprised, but just then, before
she could elaborately express her thoughts,

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.890
her extremely busy friend leaves her in the
hands of the customer experience unit head.

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.640
Mae is shown a demonstration of how to deal
with customers and the metrics used to rate

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.070
her performance.

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.909
Mae was hoping to get her score above 90 but
Annie reassured that her 87 score was satisfactory

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:50.340
for the first week.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.850
The reassurance sunk in as the friends got
seated at The Circle conference “Dream Friday”.

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.640
It is hosted by Bailey, a laid-back CEO making
jokes here and there, while introducing the

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.000
company’s latest innovation SeeChange.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.130
SeeChange is cameras as small as a coin and
that can be implemented anywhere without being

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:07.130
noticed.

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.890
The moral motive behind this, according to
Bailey, is tracking wrongdoers and holding

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.300
them accountable in order to make a change
in the community.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.700
This announcement is followed by a party featuring
the artist Beck.

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.010
Annie then takes Mae to a somehow secret place
where she makes her say a verbal non-disclosure

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.990
statement, as what goes on there is extremely
confidential being the place where the magic

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.990
happens.

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:31.989
Annie has to rush to catch a flight to Australia,
too much for business trips if you ask me.

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:33.510
Mae is then left alone.

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.260
She makes her way back to the party and tries
to start a conversation with who she assumed

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.010
to be a fellow employee.

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.230
The man was busy on his phone, still he welcomed
the conversation with Mae.

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.130
Since she seemed excited about her new position
he guessed that she was a newbie or one of

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.670
the “guppies”, as Bailey liked to call
them.

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.000
He strangely told her, with a hint of sarcasm,
to keep on that excitement as he left for

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.450
an urgent matter.

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.730
Mae spent the weekend at a certain gathering
with her parents who are proud of her for

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.980
making it to the “Greatest company of the
country”.

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.000
They’re still trying to pimp her up with
Mercer but Mae isn’t so fond of the idea

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.700
and she goes as far as saying some hurtful
words to him, degrading to some extent.

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.879
Once back at the table with her parents, her
dad has an episode and her mom escorts him

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:15.430
back inside.

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.129
Feeling overwhelmed, Mae goes kayaking as
she lets her sorrows roll down her cheeks

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:20.920
in the form of tears.

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.709
A new week for Mae at The Circle and as she
is watching the news coverage about the senator

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:29.400
questioning The Circle’s true intentions,
she is interrupted by two of her co-workers.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.170
They try to make her feel guilty about not
attending some gatherings and activities during

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.230
the weekends and seek personal information
that they note down on their tablets.

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.920
They were building a profile of Mae and wanted
to know everything about her.

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.510
They seemed to know about her father’s MS
that she hasn’t mentioned before and went

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.269
on as far as telling her to catch up with
the eight thousand group messages.

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:52.490
The exchange was an explicit privacy violation
sugar-coated by the purpose of enhancing the

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:54.100
sense of community.

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:58.040
Mae is left in disbelief but she still does
her best to boost her efforts and she finally

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.180
achieves a perfect score.

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.819
She has a brief call with her mom that updates
her on her father’s health.

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:07.459
Mae feels sorry that she’s not there for
them as she stays at the dorm to keep up with

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:08.760
her work.

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.040
During the video call, she notices her friend’s
Mercer’s latest work, a pretty chandelier

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.940
that she shares on The Circle community group.

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:20.310
Busy Annie is back and she introduces Mae
to Dr. Jessica who performs her medical intake

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.930
that is none-other than daily data stored
on the company’s Cloud and available via

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.699
the employees’ tablets.

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:29.130
The Doctor offers to get Mae’s parents on
their health plan which takes Mae over the

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.460
moon as it is an opportunity to save her father.

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.729
Next up is a conference by Tom, Bailey’s
associate, and hosting a senator candidate

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:41.139
who advocates accountability through data
sharing via the TrueYou page.

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:44.090
Another afterparty calls for another unusual
talk.

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.590
This time with an employee who works in iris
scanning and tracking, boasting about how

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.750
they can save children from predators with
their technology.

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:54.870
Mae is amazed until she is told that it is
not through a worn bracelet but a chip implemented

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:56.120
in the bone.

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.580
While Mae is trying to make sense of what
she heard she spots the same guy from last

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.330
time, busy on his phone once again.

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.880
When she walks up the stairs to greet him
he shoves his phone in his pocket and after

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.930
they exchange a few words he suggests showing
her something to which she complies and heads

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:11.169
downstairs.

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:14.660
Upon introducing her to where the data is
stored the guy reveals his identity as Ty

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.630
Laffite, creator of TrueYou.

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:20.800
He doesn’t approve of monetizing personal
data and discarding privacy.

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.400
Mae is shocked but she accepts to keep this
encounter a secret.

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.490
The next day Mae has a visitor, Mercer, who
has been receiving death threats for being

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:31.750
a deer killer upon the picture that Mae shared
with the group.

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:36.479
Upset, Mae trespasses to get the kayak at
night and goes into an agitated bay.

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:40.710
She is knocked off her kayak and is holding
on for dear life,when a helicopter and rescuers

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:42.120
save her.

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:46.810
According to them, it was thanks to the SeeChange
cameras that she was spotted and saved.

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:50.400
What follows is an interview held by Bailey
where Mae talks about how frightening her

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:54.870
experience was and that it was thanks to the
SeeChange Cameras that she was saved.

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:58.530
Then through a smart manipulative speech Bailey
comes to the conclusion that everything should

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:02.830
be shared, it is selfish not to share, and
that secrets are lies.

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:07.420
Mae Holland is the first subject to have a
portable SeeChange camera 24/7.

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:11.419
Within the ecstatic crowds applauding his
initiative we notice a very distraught Annie,

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:15.400
unlike her previous enthusiastic self and
also a disappointed Ty.

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:19.660
And so, Mae is being watched from waking up
in the morning and doing her most basic hygiene

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:23.460
routine up to making calls with her parents,
and her day at work.

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:28.320
She is in her 3rd week of transparency with
2.3 million viewers currently watching.

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:31.990
When she’s back at her dorm room she checks
on her folks through their camera and catches

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:34.720
them being intimate, for the whole world to
see.

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:37.330
Mae is embarrassed but tries to brush it off.

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:40.660
She tries checking on them again but their
cameras are disconnected.

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:45.280
The following day, on her way around campus,
Mae spots Annie but the latter avoids her

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:48.130
and keeps walking till Mae calls her by her
full name.

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:52.380
Mae has 3 mins off of video for bathroom usage
and that’s where she gets to have a private

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:56.020
talk with haggard Annie who tells Mae that
she’s way deep in and there are things she

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:57.360
doesn’t realize.

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:01.120
During a meeting about vote registration,
Mae suggests taking it up a notch and make

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:05.640
it mandatory for everyone to vote through
Circle, for ideally democratic countries where

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:07.140
everybody’s voice is heard.

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:10.800
Annie tries to knock sense into her during
the meeting but to no avail.

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:14.690
On the other hand, the idea of glorifying
the circle through this initiative is more

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:16.759
than welcomed by Bailey.

00:07:16.759 --> 00:07:21.250
Mae is then given the spotlight as she announces
during a conference that her idea is now possible

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:23.580
as 22 countries have agreed to it.

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:28.289
During the same conference, she introduces
SoulSearch: a way to find anyone anytime,

00:07:28.289 --> 00:07:29.580
under twenty minutes.

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:33.350
And so she gives a demo by looking for a fugitive
that ends up being found through the eyes

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:35.970
of the billions of people using The Circle.

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:40.430
That only fuels the exhilarating crowd who
wants more and is now suggesting Mercer.

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:44.900
Mae declines the shouting crowd’s demands
but Bailey steps in and forces her to do it.

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:47.470
Ty is watching the full conference.

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:51.370
Mercer is found by strangers around the forest
, they try to barge in his house while calling

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:53.030
him a deer killer.

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:56.630
Mercer manages to get in his car but they
go as far as following him.

00:07:56.630 --> 00:08:01.419
The pursuit ends tragically with Mercer drifting
off the bridge down a ravine and dying.

00:08:01.419 --> 00:08:04.360
Mae is grieving back at her parents’ home
for 4 days.

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:08.930
She calls Annie who’s in Scotland, she tries
to convince her to back off the Circle, especially

00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:13.160
after what happened, but Mae seems brainwashed
and doesn’t hold The Circle accountable,

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:17.050
and still believes that the services can be
improved to avoid such accidents.

00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:19.490
On her way back to work, she calls Ty.

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:23.500
Mae declines Bailey and Tom’s suggestion
of taking another position with a more flexible

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:27.920
schedule like Ty Laffite and she just enforces
the fact that a fund should be set for Mercer's

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:28.920
family.

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:32.329
Ty calls Mae and they meet underground by
the cloud storage.

00:08:32.329 --> 00:08:35.909
He tells Mae that he did what she instructed
and that he discovered so many things way

00:08:35.909 --> 00:08:40.200
more dangerous than he thought and that Mercer’s
death could be a game changer.

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:43.489
Mae nods and heads back to the conference
hosted by Bailey.

00:08:43.489 --> 00:08:46.739
Mae joins the discussion and calls Tom to
join the stage as well.

00:08:46.739 --> 00:08:50.790
She goes on about how Mercer could’ve been
still alive if they had never lost contact

00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:55.110
to begin with, through accessible locating
and information anywhere anytime.

00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:58.970
She then holds up two SeeChange cameras and
turns to Bailey and Tom asking them to be

00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:00.929
fully transparent as well.

00:09:00.929 --> 00:09:05.829
The men are taken aback but it only gets worse
for them as Mae discloses their personal files,

00:09:05.829 --> 00:09:09.410
secret ones and even encrypted ones and sends
them to the crowds.

00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:13.850
That marks the ends of the two as Mae rises
to be the new leader for a better Circle.

00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:18.230
The last scene is Mae kayaking on the Bay
with a couple of drones hovering over her.

00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:22.129
The image then zooms out to reveal hundreds
of video shots from different countries and

00:09:22.129 --> 00:09:23.129
different people.

00:09:23.129 --> 00:09:27.300
That’s quite the ending that leaves unanswered
questions: Was Mae in it with Ty all along

00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:29.019
trying to throw Bailey off?

00:09:29.019 --> 00:09:31.130
What changes will Mae make to the Circle?

00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:33.189
Will privacy be forever lost?

00:09:33.189 --> 00:09:34.319
The end.

00:09:34.319 --> 00:09:35.800
Thank you for watching!
