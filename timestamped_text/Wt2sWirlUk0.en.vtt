Hi, Israq21 here

00:00:01.968 --> 00:00:04.652
Today, I will recap a movie called Life Like

00:00:04.652 --> 00:00:08.005
Life Like is a 2019 science-fiction drama film

00:00:08.005 --> 00:00:12.370
This is spoiler content video, Enjoy the video and letâ€™s start the story

00:00:16.396 --> 00:00:22.135
The film begins by showing a young couple named Sophie, and James, they are a newly married couple,

00:00:22.135 --> 00:00:25.662
while kissing, James got a call that his father had died,

00:00:25.662 --> 00:00:30.259
Since then, James and Sophie moved into his father's luxury house

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:34.486
apart from a luxurious house, James also inherited his father's job,

00:00:34.486 --> 00:00:38.283
but unfortunately, Sophie is not used to this luxurious life,

00:00:38.283 --> 00:00:45.364
Sophie didn't want any maids to serve her, even though, the maids worked happily, Sophie still didn't want anyone other than the two of them,

00:00:45.364 --> 00:00:50.160
Sophie finally fired all the maids in her house by giving them 2 years' salary,

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.559
James, who knew this at first, was disappointed with Sophie.

00:00:54.559 --> 00:01:00.947
Because for such a big house there had to be a maid to serve them, but James could only obey and accept what his wife wanted.

00:01:00.947 --> 00:01:05.266
After that because they felt hot, so they are making love in the bed,

00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:11.791
long story short, when James was busy at work, Sophie called him, because she needed his help to start an engine,

00:01:11.791 --> 00:01:16.703
So James repaired the machine at night, but he was unable to turn it back on,

00:01:16.703 --> 00:01:26.223
Sophie who was still not used to her new environment and James who was always busy at work, sophie finally started to complain, even though she herself fired all of her maids

00:01:26.223 --> 00:01:33.944
James finally went to a company that develops modern robots that look exactly like humans, the robots will be rented out to customers as waiters

00:01:33.944 --> 00:01:38.628
In The company, James is going to rent this beautiful robot, but Sophie does not agree

00:01:38.628 --> 00:01:45.340
because the robot looks beautiful and perfect to be a servant at her house, Sophie is afraid that she will be jealous of the robot,

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:51.673
Finally, they both agreed to hire a male robot named, Henry, to be a maid in their house,

00:01:51.673 --> 00:01:59.254
at first, there were no problems, Henry as a robot prepares breakfast every morning, and cuts the grass as ordered by his owner,

00:01:59.254 --> 00:02:06.543
when Sophie was about to wear clothes, she didn't expect Henry to be in her room, and Sophie told Henry to get out of her room,

00:02:06.543 --> 00:02:12.636
Sophie who feel uncomfortable with Hendry starting to complain to James, while he was very busy with his work,

00:02:12.636 --> 00:02:16.596
Until finally, their relationship became increasingly strained,

00:02:16.596 --> 00:02:20.687
on the sidelines of the relationship between James and Sophie was tenuous,

00:02:20.687 --> 00:02:22.797
Sophie began to close with Henry,

00:02:22.797 --> 00:02:28.922
Sophie feels lonely because James is rarely home now, so Sophie tries to spend more time with Henry,

00:02:28.922 --> 00:02:33.856
Sophie tells Henry to read a book that contains emotions and feelings that humans feel,

00:02:33.856 --> 00:02:36.179
but Sophie shouldn't be given the book to Henry,

00:02:36.179 --> 00:02:41.806
because the robot's intelligence system will adapt to it, so Henry will have feelings and a love like humans,

00:02:41.806 --> 00:02:45.973
when at night, Sophie woke up hearing something outside her house,

00:02:45.973 --> 00:02:51.979
Sophie came out of the house, and it turned out that Henry was sleeping outside without wearing any clothes at all.

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:55.053
Henry said, that he dreams of being a human,

00:02:55.053 --> 00:03:03.087
The next day, James and Sophie, who felt the strangeness of Henry's robot, immediately went to meet Julian, the owner of the robot company,

00:03:03.087 --> 00:03:06.894
Julian said, it was because they over-developed Henry's emotions,

00:03:06.894 --> 00:03:10.249
James and Sophie treat Henry too much like a human,

00:03:10.249 --> 00:03:15.374
after returning home, James blamed Sophie for being closer to Henry recently,

00:03:15.374 --> 00:03:18.297
Sophie spends most of her time at home with Henry,

00:03:18.297 --> 00:03:25.135
Especially, when Sophie tells Hendri to read books about emotions and feelings, and then discuss them with Henry,

00:03:25.135 --> 00:03:30.093
Long story short, after coming home from work, James found a letter from Sophie,

00:03:30.093 --> 00:03:37.452
but it had long been made by Sophie for James, precisely when they first moved to the house, But James had only just read it now,

00:03:37.452 --> 00:03:43.626
after that, he took the initiative to put candles in his room to invite Sophie, to sleep together and making love,

00:03:43.626 --> 00:03:46.580
but unfortunately, Sophie refused it,

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:51.977
The next day, James is very confused with his work, while Sophie was busy chatting with Henry,

00:03:51.977 --> 00:03:57.432
Henry said that he had felt emotions in him, and felt that he was programmed to make Sophie happy,

00:03:57.432 --> 00:03:59.200
Henry misunderstood the meaning,

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:05.784
So that later he will serve Sophie and James without any restrictions at all, including sleep together and making love with them,

00:04:05.784 --> 00:04:08.465
At this time, Sophie is starting to like Henry,

00:04:08.465 --> 00:04:11.753
Sophie even dreams of making love with Henry,

00:04:11.753 --> 00:04:19.474
when James went to work, Sophie accidentally opened her bedroom door, and sighed on the bed, so henry could hear her moans,

00:04:19.474 --> 00:04:23.827
when satisfied, Sophie came out and saw Henry who was just watching her,

00:04:23.827 --> 00:04:26.807
Sophie also asked Henry to accompany her to swim,

00:04:26.807 --> 00:04:31.849
and it turns out, that James hasn't gone to work yet, he feels jealous seeing their closeness,

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:35.155
James is going to consult with Julian about Henry,

00:04:35.155 --> 00:04:42.206
Julian said that Henry's behavior would match what his owner wanted, so if Sophie likes Henry, Henry will also like Sophie.

00:04:42.206 --> 00:04:45.906
Then James told Henry not to interact with Sophie anymore,

00:04:45.906 --> 00:04:51.269
but Henry complained to Sophie, which eventually, James and Sophie argued again,

00:04:51.269 --> 00:04:53.707
Then Sophie left the house for a few days,

00:04:53.707 --> 00:04:57.035
At this time, it's just james and henry alone in the house,

00:04:57.035 --> 00:05:01.080
when james asks for his razor to Henry, Henry comes without clothes at all,

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.378
then Henry explains that he only wants to make them both happy,

00:05:04.378 --> 00:05:09.281
when henry shaved james's beard, henry suddenly got closer and immediately kissed James,

00:05:11.344 --> 00:05:16.503
James, who didn't make love last night with sophie, immediately vented his lust for Henry,

00:05:16.503 --> 00:05:18.607
and there was a samurai sword fight

00:05:20.234 --> 00:05:24.232
The next day, James didn't seem to remember what happened last night,

00:05:24.232 --> 00:05:28.159
he thought, it was just a dream, so he is going straight to his office,

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:33.835
in his office, james invites Sophie to get better, but Sophie still can't accept James back,

00:05:33.835 --> 00:05:40.169
it turns out, that sophie secretly always comes home, when james goes to work, She only want to meet with Henry,

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:43.933
Because Sophie feels hot, so Sophie make love with Henry,

00:05:43.933 --> 00:05:47.841
but when Henry said the word, I love you, Sophie was immediately shocked,

00:05:47.841 --> 00:05:51.063
because Henry's robot should not be programmed to love his owner,

00:05:51.063 --> 00:05:54.511
but Henry innocently said, that he just wanted to make his owner happy,

00:05:54.511 --> 00:05:57.512
so Henry expressed it by saying I love you to Sophie,

00:05:57.512 --> 00:06:00.640
At this time, Henry had crossed the line

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:04.087
and when James came home, he found Sophie sitting by the fire,

00:06:04.087 --> 00:06:06.579
and Sophie said that Henry had kissed her

00:06:06.579 --> 00:06:15.268
James was disappointed with Sophie, because actually, Henry's robot will do what his owner wants, and when Henry kisses Sophie, then that's what Sophie wants,

00:06:15.268 --> 00:06:20.626
James also came to Henry and punched him, then pulled out Henry's bed, so he couldn't get up

00:06:20.626 --> 00:06:24.389
The next day, James and Sophie are waiting for Julian's arrival,

00:06:24.389 --> 00:06:26.843
but Henry had not yet woken up from his bed,

00:06:26.843 --> 00:06:29.813
because it was too long waiting, james goes to work,

00:06:29.813 --> 00:06:32.674
then suddenly henry come, then wondering to sophie,

00:06:32.674 --> 00:06:34.478
why did you turn off my bed ?

00:06:34.478 --> 00:06:36.060
what was wrong with me ?

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:42.778
Henry also explain, that he was programmed only to make James and Sophie happy, so that's why he did what his owner wanted,

00:06:42.778 --> 00:06:47.216
Henry also told Sophie about the samurai sword fight he had with James,

00:06:47.216 --> 00:06:49.676
Henry told that he was sleeping with James,

00:06:49.676 --> 00:06:54.677
Not long after that, Julian came, but Sophie had to go see James in his office,

00:06:54.677 --> 00:07:03.048
At this time, we get an oddity, the bruises on Henry's face after being punched by James, it shouldn't be bruised like that, because Henry is a robot

00:07:03.048 --> 00:07:06.566
Julian also went to Henry and ordered him to go to his bed,

00:07:06.566 --> 00:07:10.165
but Henry had realized that Julian had been lying to him all this time,

00:07:10.165 --> 00:07:15.580
Suddenly, the scene returns to Sophie who is angry, because James has sleep together with Henry,

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:23.219
but James explains, that he did it because he was rejected when he asked Sophie for making love that night, so he finally took it out on Henry,

00:07:23.219 --> 00:07:27.754
Well, because they both made mistakes, they finally made up again,

00:07:27.754 --> 00:07:33.100
when they came home, They were surprised by Hendry who was outside without wearing clothes,

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:35.658
Henry has realized that all along he is a human,

00:07:35.658 --> 00:07:39.690
Julian has lied to Henry, and all the fake robots in his company,

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:45.834
Julian adopted and educated them to be robots from infancy to adulthood, and of course itâ€™s only for business,

00:07:45.834 --> 00:07:52.278
The FBI also confiscated Julian's company, and evacuated all the humans who were turned into robots,

00:07:52.278 --> 00:07:56.911
they should get some more guidance, because their brains have been brainwashed by Julian,

00:07:56.911 --> 00:08:01.280
when James and Sophie and 2 FBI members returned home to look for Henry,

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:04.540
the 2 FBI members were immediately shot dead by Julian,

00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:09.301
Julian said, that James and Sophie had destroyed the business he had built with his father,

00:08:09.301 --> 00:08:13.106
He also told the origins of Henry who was a wasted baby with bruises,

00:08:13.106 --> 00:08:16.086
and was finally adopted by Julian to be a fake robot,

00:08:16.086 --> 00:08:18.205
When they wanted to shoot Sophie and James,

00:08:18.205 --> 00:08:20.575
Henry suddenly came and killed Julian,

00:08:20.575 --> 00:08:25.501
Then Henry took a knife, and cut open his stomach, because he wanted to prove that he is a human,

00:08:25.501 --> 00:08:30.625
When Henry was dying, Henry also apologized to james and sophie for destroying his household,

00:08:30.625 --> 00:08:34.528
but they said, you taught us to love each other, and accept each other's shortcomings,

00:08:34.528 --> 00:08:35.990
we love you, henry,

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:38.400
I'm really sad here, I swear...

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:40.466
finally, Henry died

00:08:42.798 --> 00:08:43.943
5 years later,

00:08:43.943 --> 00:08:47.887
James and Sophie have grown old, and they have a child named, Henry,

00:08:47.887 --> 00:08:52.772
they named him, henry, because Hendy is a special person who has ever existed in their life

00:08:52.772 --> 00:08:53.980
and the movie is

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:55.337
