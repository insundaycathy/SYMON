00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.780
Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:05.940
Today I'm going to explain an action, adventure,
and fantasy film called “Sucker Punch.”

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.220
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:08.950
Watch out and take care.

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:13.599
In the 1960s, a girl nicknamed Babydoll receives
news on her mother's death and rushes to say

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:15.340
her final goodbyes.

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.270
Babydoll has a younger sister, who at the
moment shares the grief with her.

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.500
On their mother’s deathbed is their stepfather,
who is smiling menacingly while looking at

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:22.779
the two girls.

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:26.060
After the funeral, the stepfather opens their
mother's will, where he finds out that she

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.599
has left him nothing and that all her possessions
are to be given to her two daughters.

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:32.840
This angers him, causing him to act manically,
burning the will.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.160
On that stormy night, Babydoll watches over
her younger sister and puts her to sleep to

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.350
comfort her.

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.649
Just as she leaves the room, her stepfather
waits for her in the hallway, seeming to have

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.140
an evil plan.

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.239
Babydoll runs to her room as fast as she could
and bars the door to keep him from coming

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.069
in; she even scratches him out of defense,
which angers him further.

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:52.530
Realizing that inflicting physical harm on
Babydoll isn’t enough, he goes to his younger

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.069
stepdaughter’s room instead.

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:56.369
He enters the room and starts unbuttoning
his shirt.

00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:59.420
Babydoll exits through the window and reenters
through the window.

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.679
She holds her stepfather at gunpoint, fires
at him but misses.

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:07.280
She shoots again, hitting his arm, but unfortunately,
the bullet hits her sister.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.590
Realizing what had happened, Babydoll runs
to hug her, points the gun at her stepfather

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.119
again, but could not bring herself to kill
him.

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:17.500
Eventually, authorities arrive and blame the
tragedy on Babydoll, and she is declared mentally

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:18.770
unstable.

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.320
After the incident, Babydoll is brought to
the Lennox House to be institutionalized.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.270
Two nurses drag her out of the car and bring
her inside.

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.509
At the end of a dim hallway, Blue Jones, one
of the asylum’s staff, awaits them as he

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:31.409
makes a deal with the stepfather.

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.320
He holds the keys to multiple doors of the
institution and acts as the head of security.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.659
He leads them into the “theater” where
other girls who are labeled insane are kept.

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:43.539
The head psychiatrist, Dr. Vera Gorski, supervises
the girls and utilizes the room as a place

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:45.109
where they could socialize.

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:49.149
As Babydoll observes the girls, the stepfather
bribes Blue Jones into forging Dr. Gorski's

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:52.740
signature to have his stepdaughter lobotomized,
which will stop her from informing authorities

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.500
of the true circumstances that led to her
sister’s death.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.929
The poor Babydoll is still speechless about
how fast things in her life are changing;

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:02.630
she observes the institution, watching the
daily procedures done on her.

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.420
The day of her scheduled lobotomy arrives;
out of nowhere, she wakes up in another realm

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.379
where the asylum has turned into a brothel.

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:12.110
In there, Blue becomes a mobster, while the
stepfather is dressed as a priest.

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.420
The star of the show, Sweet Pea, approaches
the three of them to welcome Babydoll and

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.180
asks her sister, Rocket, to show the newbie
around the establishment.

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.000
Before following Rocket for the tour, Babydoll
spits at her stepfather to express her utter

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.069
disgust, making him angry and delusional.

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.751
Rocket is naturally friendly and assures Babydoll
that she will be comfortable in no time, as

00:02:29.751 --> 00:02:32.069
it just takes a little while to get used to.

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:35.230
She shows her a room where they bring “clients”
and reveals that they are the “main attractions”

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.990
to lure in customers for Blue’s other businesses
such as guns, gambling, medications, and the

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.990
like.

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:45.840
In the rehearsal room, she is introduced to
the other dancers: Amber and Blondie.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.280
Rocket informs Babydoll that everybody gets
a dance routine that they practice until they

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.200
can perform it perfectly.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.580
That night, Babydoll breaks into tears in
the bathroom, completely shattered about how

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.120
her life is at the moment.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.519
The following day, while she scrubs the floor
in the hallway, Rocket does her chore in the

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:00.519
kitchen.

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:03.840
While the cook is busy eating his meal, she
tries to take a small block of chocolate to

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.060
enjoy; little does she know, the cook sees
what she did and punishes her for it.

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.069
Babydoll hears her screams and enters the
kitchen, where she sees the cook pinning Rocket

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:12.180
to the ground.

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.080
Immediately, she comes to her rescue by holding
the cook at knifepoint, who now has no choice

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.810
but to let the both of them go.

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.010
Both of them make it to the end of the hallway
just as the bell rings, signifying that it

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.000
is time for their daily rehearsals.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.250
In class, Dr. Gorski is envisioned as their
dance instructor.

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.090
She calls Babydoll to come to the middle for
her to be examined.

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.269
As Blue enters the room, Dr. Gorski plays
a song.

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:35.610
Babydoll seems clueless and unsure of what
to do, so Dr. Gorski approaches her to say

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:39.010
that she has no purpose of being in the institution
if she does not dance.

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.200
She plays the music again, and this time,
Babydoll is willing to dance for her survival.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.019
She closes her eyes and wakes up in a fantasy
world; a majestic temple in the snow stands

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:50.090
before her, so she enters to see what is inside.

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.849
With the door slightly opened, Babydoll enters
and sees the Wise Man surrounded by candlelights,

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:55.930
holding a sword.

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.430
He asks her what she seeks for, to which she
replies, “a way out.”

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.430
The wise man promises her that he will help
her get the freedom that she desperately desires.

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.569
Beside him, he opens a box with weapons that
she needs for her journey and hands it to

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:07.569
her.

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:10.969
He then adds that she needs five more items
that will be useful and necessary: a map,

00:04:10.969 --> 00:04:12.940
fire, a knife, and a key.

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.120
The fifth thing is a mystery that she must
find out on her own, which he claims is the

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.980
reason and the goal of her journey.

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:22.260
He also says that to get the item, a sacrifice
would be needed in exchange for the victory.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.600
After relaying this message, the wise man
makes her turn around, where she finds three

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.630
samurai giants ready to fight her.

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.720
The first samurai kicks her back into the
temple, but she bravely fights back in defense.

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.890
With every strike of the samurai’s sword,
she manages to dodge it by jumping into the

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:37.000
air, trying her best not to get hit.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.530
Eventually, she manages to bring the giant
down by striking its knees and cutting off

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:41.880
its head.

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.510
Out of nowhere, the second samurai launches
a rocket, causing a big explosion inside the

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:47.510
temple.

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:50.610
Finding out that it didn’t kill Babydoll,
it brings out an enormous machine gun, recklessly

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.090
shooting it everywhere.

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:55.500
With impeccable speed, she dodges every bullet
and runs toward the giant to shoot it directly

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.790
in the face, causing its instant death.

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:00.650
She then walks bravely outside to face the
final samurai.

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:04.430
It advances at her, and she gathers enough
strength to kill it with just one strike.

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.900
Just like that, Babydoll has defeated the
three giants despite her size and amateur

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:09.500
experience in combat.

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:13.040
As the music for her performance ends, she
wakes up in the rehearsal room, finding everyone

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.070
impressed and cheering her on.

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:18.420
Completely taken aback, Blue looks at her
intently before leaving the room.

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:21.740
For the first time in weeks, she feels a sense
of accomplishment.

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:25.370
That night, Babydoll lets the other girls
know of her plan to escape from the establishment,

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:28.840
but Sweet Pea is bitter about this idea, saying
that it is impossible.

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.970
Blondie enters the conversation to say that
the last three girls who attempted to escape

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:33.290
have died.

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:37.190
Despite this, Rocket is convinced that Babydoll’s
plan could be effective in their escape.

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:40.520
She and Sweet Pea get into an argument about
trying to get out; Rocket then tells her older

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:44.770
sister that Babydoll even saved her from the
cook, believing intensely in her strength.

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:48.790
Because of this, Sweet Pea takes time to contemplate
giving in to their escape plan.

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:52.360
Babydoll enters the room, writes the things
they need on a small blackboard, then discusses

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:53.890
the whereabouts of the items.

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:57.290
The map in Blue’s office, a lighter that
will cause fire for when they escape, a knife

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:00.780
from the cook, and Blue’s master key that
he wears around his neck.

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:04.370
Babydoll finally convinces the four girls
to participate in preparing an escape.

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:07.960
She intends to use her dances as a distraction
while the three girls obtain the necessary

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:08.960
items.

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:12.230
Sweet Pea volunteers to take the map and makes
her way to Blue’s office to inform him that

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:13.990
Babydoll is about to dance.

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:17.480
Excitedly, he heads to the rehearsal room
for some entertainment while Sweet Pea stays

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:18.630
behind for her mission.

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:22.060
As Babydoll closes her eyes to begin the dance,
she is back in the fantasy world where the

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:24.390
four girls and the wise man appear as well.

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:27.680
In this vision, they are in a world war setting
where they have to obtain the map by entering

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:31.370
the enemy trenches and infiltrating a bunker
protected by German soldiers.

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:35.310
All of them make their way through the soldiers
as Amber climbs to a robotic war machine.

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:38.900
The war resumes; bullets fill the air, and
danger is just among them.

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:42.420
The girls fight together to attack the enemies
in hopes of obtaining the first item.

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:45.390
Amber flies into the air with her machine
while shooting planes that pass by to bring

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:46.760
them down faster.

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:50.750
With the air slightly clear, the girls mercilessly
shoot at the enemies and fight them.

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:54.310
They manage to bring German soldiers down
despite being outnumbered and outgunned.

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:57.460
Sweet Pea and Rocket near the bunker and both
of them struggle to fight back even with all

00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:58.670
their skills.

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:00.810
The enemies manage to get a hold of them.

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:04.490
Gathering enough strength, Sweet Pea gets
up to help her sister, surrounded by steampunk

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:05.490
soldiers.

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:08.860
The four of them reunite just outside the
bunker, where a weird-looking commander holds

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:10.370
the map.

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:13.960
Babydoll manages to make her way inside, but
the rest of them get left behind.

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:17.100
She uses her sword to fight the guards surrounding
the commander and successfully takes them

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:18.100
down.

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:21.440
The commander comes face to face with her,
attacks, but the structure collapses, and

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:25.690
an officer runs away with the map before Babydoll
could stop him from escaping in an airship.

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:29.600
She then uses a machine gun to shoot the airship,
causing it to explode, leaving the officer

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:31.300
to fall where she stands.

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:34.410
She takes the map from him, but the commander
comes from behind her, asking her to give

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:35.830
the map back.

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:38.780
Babydoll throws the map into the air, and
the girls come to her rescue, crushing the

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:40.480
commander with Amber’s machine.

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:43.570
They all escape and grab the map just as her
dance ends.

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:47.280
Extremely satisfied with her performance,
Blue and Dr. Gorski talks outside to discuss

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:48.880
Babydoll being on stage.

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:52.600
Dr. Gorski contradicts the idea, saying that
the girl is not ready.

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:55.990
Blue reminds her of his authority, making
her give in to his requests.

00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:59.540
He then goes back to his office and notices
the hot photocopy machine, which means that

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:01.030
it has been recently used.

00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:03.920
He looks at the map and finds out that someone
has touched it.

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:07.450
That night, the mayor enters the brothel,
where Blue warmly welcomes him.

00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:11.390
Known for his love for cigars, the girls assign
Amber to steal his lighter, as he is her regular

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:12.410
customer.

00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:14.910
She agrees and approaches the old man to obtain
the lighter.

00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:18.860
Meanwhile, the show is about to start, and
Dr. Gorski introduces the newest member of

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:20.920
her team to the attending guests.

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:24.120
Babydoll shyly begins her dance and enters
the fantasy world again, which mirrors their

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:25.500
attempt to take the lighter from the mayor.

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:29.090
In a plane, the wise man explains that they
should drop into the courtyard of a burning

00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:31.300
castle, and kill creatures along the way.

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:34.729
Their goal is to find a baby dragon and retrieve
two crystals inside it while Amber pilots

00:08:34.729 --> 00:08:35.919
the plane.

00:08:35.919 --> 00:08:39.209
Before the girls’ descent, the wise man
reminds them not to wake the mother dragon,

00:08:39.209 --> 00:08:40.599
which confuses them.

00:08:40.599 --> 00:08:44.240
As they make their way down, the girls immediately
shoot at their enemies, and find the dragons’

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:46.030
chamber hidden deep into the castle.

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:48.970
They finally see the baby dragon lying above
human carcasses.

00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:51.420
Babydoll slits its throat to get to the crystals.

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:54.339
She lights both of them against each other,
but the mother dragon comes from below the

00:08:54.339 --> 00:08:56.149
pit and blows fire at them.

00:08:56.149 --> 00:09:00.199
It notices the dead baby dragon and whimpers
just before it flees to chase the girls.

00:09:00.199 --> 00:09:03.670
Ready to avenge the death of its baby, the
dragon gets on top of the castle, starting

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:06.410
to attack the girls, but Amber stops it with
the plane.

00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:10.149
The dragon then shifts her attention to the
aircraft, starting to chase it relentlessly,

00:09:10.149 --> 00:09:13.629
putting Amber in full responsibility while
Blondie shoots at it from inside.

00:09:13.629 --> 00:09:16.879
She aims the plane into a bridge to cause
the dragon to crash into it, but it only grows

00:09:16.879 --> 00:09:18.230
more aggressive.

00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:20.660
It bites into the plane, damaging the tail.

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:23.860
As the dragon sees Babydoll in the palace
grounds, it charges towards her and blows

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:24.890
fire.

00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:28.620
She jumps into the air to prevent being burnt,
then proceeds to stab the dragon in the head,

00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:29.720
finally killing it.

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:33.180
She feels more empowered than ever, and at
that instant, her performance ends, leaving

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:35.410
the mayor impressed and clueless about his
lighter.

00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:38.680
In the dressing room, the girls celebrate
after Amber reveals that she was able to get

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:39.680
it.

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:42.400
Babydoll enters to thank her and proceeds
to hide the lighter under the dresser for

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:43.490
safekeeping.

00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:46.490
In the middle of their happy moment, Blue
comes into the dressing room, sensing that

00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:47.810
something is amiss.

00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:50.660
He lets them know that he is aware of the
trespassing in his office and the loss of

00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:51.660
the mayor’s lighter.

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:54.990
In a rage, he drags Blondie to threaten them
that something terrible will happen if their

00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:56.899
scheme continues before leaving.

00:09:56.899 --> 00:09:59.490
Sweet pea gets afraid of all of them and calls
the plan off.

00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:03.600
According to her, Blue is way too powerful
to escape from, but Rocket remains firm on

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:07.500
continuing with the plan, causing a strain
in the sisters’ relationship.

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:11.209
Back in the rehearsal room, Blondie cries
while she gathers the tapes for Babydoll’s

00:10:11.209 --> 00:10:12.209
performance.

00:10:12.209 --> 00:10:15.220
Torn between giving up and participating in
the escape plan, she breaks down.

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:18.250
Dr. Gorski enters the room to comfort the
distressed girl.

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:21.829
In a motherly way, she assures her that everything
will be alright, and Blondie attempts to let

00:10:21.829 --> 00:10:23.800
the doctor know about their game plan.

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:27.660
Unfortunately, Blue walks inside the room
just before she spills the secret.

00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:30.589
The girls continue with their plan in the
kitchen, but they all get discouraged because

00:10:30.589 --> 00:10:32.090
they're incomplete.

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:34.920
Babydoll admits to Rocket that they should
give up to prevent harm to anyone.

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:39.139
Suddenly, Sweet Pea enters the kitchen with
a change of heart, and the plan resumes.

00:10:39.139 --> 00:10:42.800
She locks the kitchen doors and lets the cook
sit on a chair while Babydoll puts on another

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:43.800
performance.

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:47.339
In the fantasy world, they need to disarm
a bomb protected by a couple dozen mechanized

00:10:47.339 --> 00:10:48.339
gunmen.

00:10:48.339 --> 00:10:51.329
Their goal is to fight the enemies, deactivate
the bomb, and then steal it.

00:10:51.329 --> 00:10:55.680
A helicopter brings them to the train where
the bomb is located, and Amber is the pilot.

00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:58.079
She shoots a missile for the group to have
access to it.

00:10:58.079 --> 00:11:00.190
They fight the robots along the way and succeed
gracefully.

00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:04.089
They are significantly outnumbered, but they
manage to take every single robot down with

00:11:04.089 --> 00:11:05.350
Babydoll's lead.

00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:08.910
Sweet Pea comes for back-up, leading to the
group’s advance, even protecting her sister

00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:10.180
in the process.

00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:13.839
In a race with time, the group deactivates
the bomb with ease and proceeds to secure

00:11:13.839 --> 00:11:15.329
it with ropes to carry it with them.

00:11:15.329 --> 00:11:19.319
However, a robot gets back up and throws Rocket
into a corner of the train.

00:11:19.319 --> 00:11:21.680
It activates the bomb, and the mission fails.

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:25.199
Suddenly, Babydoll snaps out of her fantasy
and wakes up in the kitchen, where the cook

00:11:25.199 --> 00:11:26.339
snaps out of hypnosis.

00:11:26.339 --> 00:11:30.339
He notices Sweet Pea taking the knife from
him and is angered, realizing the girls’

00:11:30.339 --> 00:11:31.339
scheme.

00:11:31.339 --> 00:11:34.509
Just as the cook is about to stab Rocket,
who intends to protect her sister, Babydoll

00:11:34.509 --> 00:11:36.150
returns to the fantasy world.

00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:39.579
Sweet Pea and Rocket are left on the train,
where Rocket’s jetpack is broken.

00:11:39.579 --> 00:11:42.759
She launches Sweet Pea’s jetpack into the
air, leaving her alone on the train as her

00:11:42.759 --> 00:11:45.560
sister watches her from the air in complete
despair.

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:49.040
After arriving at the destination, the train
explodes, paralleled by the cook stabbing

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:51.850
Rocket fatally as she tries to protect her
sister.

00:11:51.850 --> 00:11:55.249
Blue storms into the kitchen to find it in
complete disaster, raging about Rocket’s

00:11:55.249 --> 00:11:57.379
death, who is an asset to his business.

00:11:57.379 --> 00:12:01.149
Sweet Pea is distressed by the passing of
her sister, acting frantic, before Blue sends

00:12:01.149 --> 00:12:03.010
his guard to take her to the closet.

00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:07.980
That night, Babydoll’s buyer, a man named
High Roller, arrives at the brothel to spend

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:09.440
a night of entertainment.

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:12.490
Before the show, Blue enters the dressing
room to sermon the girls about their behavior

00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:14.329
in the past few days.

00:12:14.329 --> 00:12:17.870
Sensing that he may get out of control, Dr.
Gorski tries to stop him, but she slaps her

00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:19.079
out of his way.

00:12:19.079 --> 00:12:22.100
The angered mobster reveals to everyone that
Blondie snitched on the girls and informed

00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:23.649
him about their plan.

00:12:23.649 --> 00:12:27.230
Full of guilt, Blondie cries and apologizes
for what she has done out of fear, but Blue

00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:28.540
is unstoppable.

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:31.889
He continues to confront them by flipping
the blackboard that reveals their game plan,

00:12:31.889 --> 00:12:34.079
and not long after that, he shoots Amber.

00:12:34.079 --> 00:12:38.259
However, it is not enough for him, so he shoots
Blondie after calling her a snitch.

00:12:38.259 --> 00:12:41.270
The distressed Dr. Gorski is sent away by
Blue’s guards, still mourning the death

00:12:41.270 --> 00:12:42.779
of the girls.

00:12:42.779 --> 00:12:46.290
After everyone leaves the room, Blue attempts
to force himself on Babydoll.

00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:49.100
He puts her against the dresser while she
desperately fights back.

00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:52.630
Luckily, she manages to get a hold of the
knife and stabs Blue in the neck.

00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:56.589
It allows her to grab the master key from
him after saying that he will never own her.

00:12:56.589 --> 00:12:59.559
She then makes her way to the closet to free
Sweet Pea and informs her that it is just

00:12:59.559 --> 00:13:01.309
the two of them from now on.

00:13:01.309 --> 00:13:04.600
With the items complete, they start a fire
to keep the orderlies busy and occupied while

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:05.600
they seek an exit.

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:09.170
They use the map to run through the hallways
unnoticed and open the gates using Blue’s

00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:10.170
key.

00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:13.720
As the fire alarms are activated, the gates
are unlocked, giving them an easy passage,

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:16.410
but a group of men blocks their way in the
courtyard.

00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:19.589
Babydoll realizes that the fifth item they
need is her sacrifice.

00:13:19.589 --> 00:13:23.149
Despite Sweet Pea's protests to be together,
Babydoll insists on showing herself to the

00:13:23.149 --> 00:13:26.440
men, thus distracting them long enough to
bid time and allow her friend to run away

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:27.499
unnoticed.

00:13:27.499 --> 00:13:31.089
Sad about separating ways, Babydoll comes
in front of the men, and one of them knocks

00:13:31.089 --> 00:13:32.089
her out.

00:13:32.089 --> 00:13:34.839
This permanently closes the fantastical realm.

00:13:34.839 --> 00:13:38.350
Back in the asylum’s surgery room, the surgeon
has finished Babydoll's lobotomy.

00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:42.269
Dr. Gorski enters and notes that during her
short stay in the institution, the girl already

00:13:42.269 --> 00:13:46.519
stabbed an orderly, started a fire, and even
helped another girl escape the asylum.

00:13:46.519 --> 00:13:50.829
The surgeon is taken aback by Babydoll's expression
after the procedure and asks Dr. Gorski why

00:13:50.829 --> 00:13:53.769
she authorized the lobotomy and many identical
ones before.

00:13:53.769 --> 00:13:57.709
Dr. Gorski realizes that Blue has been faking
her signature, just as Babydoll is escorted

00:13:57.709 --> 00:13:59.050
outside the room.

00:13:59.050 --> 00:14:02.510
The poor Babydoll is brought to a room where
Blue welcomes her and intends to force himself

00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:03.699
on her again.

00:14:03.699 --> 00:14:07.560
Suddenly, the police enter and apprehend him
from doing anything to the girl; they take

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:10.130
him away, as Babydoll sits and smiles serenely.

00:14:10.130 --> 00:14:13.540
Sweet Pea gets stopped by police at a bus
station as she tries to board a bus, but the

00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:17.559
bus driver, who happens to be the wise man,
rescues her by misleading the police and kindly

00:14:17.559 --> 00:14:18.559
letting her board.

00:14:18.559 --> 00:14:22.550
At last, Sweet Pea has another chance in life,
leaving everything behind but the bond with

00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:31.700
her friends 
and sister.
