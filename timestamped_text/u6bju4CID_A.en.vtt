Hi guys, Korean Movie Recapped here.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.480
Before we start, WARNING!

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.400
Spoilers Ahead!

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:18.000
Today, I’m going to recap a 2003 Korean
Mystery Thriller movie, called Old Boy.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.600
This movie is about a man who is captured
and imprisoned for 15 years.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.280
After he leaves, the outside world is different
than he knows.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.000
Make sure you watch until the end, because
this movie has a plot-twist.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.760
So, what will he do after being imprisoned
for 15 years?

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:34.960
Does he take his revenge?

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.440
Or does he just live as a normal person?

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.360
Let’s find it out.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.720
The movie starts with a man who is interrogated
at the police station.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.040
His name is Mr. Oh.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.080
He gets caught because he was causing some
problem while he was drunk.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.880
Even so, he is still drunk and acting weird
that makes the police annoyed.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.280
He tells the police that today is his daughter’s
birthday, so he has to celebrate it with his

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.240
family.

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.400
Oh is still arrested for some hours, until
his friend comes to pick him up.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.920
He leaves the police without any regards and
is still teasing them.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.760
Before Oh comes back, he calls his daughter
to wish on her birthday.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.880
He is also forcing his friend to say happy
birthday to his daughter.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.920
When Mr. Oh’s wife wants to talk with him,
but he suddenly disappears without a trace.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:24.000
Few months pass, Mr. Oh finds himself looking
up into a small hotel room by himself without

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.080
any interaction from outside.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.160
The only thing that comes from outside is
food.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.160
He also asks the food servant about the reason
for being caught.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:33.360
But, he gets ignored.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.440
Few years pass, and he is still trapped without
any outside view.

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.720
Suddenly, a poison gas appears to make him
sleep.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.960
It is only for some treatment for his clothes,
hair and his room.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.560
They also took his blood sample.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.200
Luckly, He also gets a TV that helps him to
learn about the outside world.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.920
Even so, he is still frustrated and stressed
because his normal life has been taken.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.880
He tries many times to end his life, but is
always stopped by the captor.

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.200
They activate the poison gas so they can treat
him.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:09.120
One day, Mr. Oh saw the news that his wife
was killed and he became the primary suspect.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:13.440
By this moment, he knows that the captor wants
to mess up his life and he promises to take

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.720
revenge on him.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.160
He starts to workout, learn from TV and train
himself to fight.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.720
So, he can kill them all once he leaves.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.920
At the same time, he also recalled his memory
of his past to find out the men behind this

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:26.240
crime.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.040
But, he got confused because he had caused
too much trouble with so many people in his

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.280
life.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.160
Ten years pass, he tries to make a move.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.760
By using a chopstick, he begins to dig a hole
through the wall.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.640
One by one the bricks have been removed for
4 years, until he can put out and sense the

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:43.520
rain by his hand.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.880
He feels so excited because he can escape
in a short time.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.840
But, the captor activates the poison gas.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.520
While he is sleeping, a lady comes and hypnotizes
him.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.440
When he wakes up, he is suddenly at the outside
world wearing neat clothes and a watch.

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.520
There is also a man who wants to end his life.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.120
Mr. Oh stop him and ask him anything about
the current world.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.920
He finds out that he has been trapped for
15 years without communicating with anyone

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.760
and feels blessed to be able to live again.

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.000
As Mr Oh leaves, the man falls from the top
of the building.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.320
While Mr. Oh walks in the city, he tries to
take a cigarette from one of the young group

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.560
men.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.560
He misses smoking so much.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.880
The young men then want to give lessons to
these insolent men but they were beaten by

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.560
Mr. Oh only using his fist.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:34.080
While he continues to walk in the city, an
unknown poor man hands him a full cash wallet

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.640
and cellphone without knowing anything about
who is the giver.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.600
Feeling confused, he also feels hungry and
stops at a sushi restaurant.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.680
While he is about eating, someone calls him
and asks about how the clothes were.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.720
He is furious and asks loudly who the caller
is.

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.520
He also guessed several names, but all of
them are false.

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:56.080
The captor says it is not important who he
is, but the question should be why.

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.480
Mr. Oh is trying to ask why he was captured,
but the call ended.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.280
He tries to think while eating, but suddenly
he faints.

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.520
When he wakes up, he is with the restaurant
servant, sleeping in her place.

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:12.160
The woman asks him to not do anything foolish,
but he is still doing it while she wants to

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:12.320
pee.

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.280
Then, she introduces her name, Mi Do.

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.720
She also says that she loves him at first
sight.

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.280
Helped by Mi Do, Mr. Oh tries to find his
daughter and finds out that she has been adopted

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.240
and moved overseas.

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.240
Because of that, he decides to focus on his
revenge.

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.080
He is looking for the restaurant which always
served his food during captivity and will

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.040
never be forgotten.

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.680
He visits every chinese restaurant there and
tastes them one by one until he finds it.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.040
He follows the delivery men of this restaurant
to the building that has a secret floor before

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.160
he kills him brutally.

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:51.120
There, he finds the man who runs the criminal
organization that handles private prison for

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.920
money.

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.480
Mr Oh torture him bad until he wants to talk.

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:58.160
He never meets his clients ever but he always
records their talks.

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.760
He leaves by taking the records but not as
easy as he comes.

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.120
This organization is backed up by gangsters.

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.920
Oh fights them all alone by using a hammer
on his hand.

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:11.120
He's unstoppable even though he's been stabbed
in the back.

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.360
He manages to leave, but he collapses because
losing a lot of blood.

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:20.560
A pedestrian helps him by calling a taxi and
leaves him by saying farewell and with a devilish

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:21.360
smile on him.

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:26.000
The next day, he finally meets his old friends
and asks him for help.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.720
They try to trace the captor by using the
call records.

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:34.000
Turns out, the captor is living in the next
Mi Do’s apartment, and his name is Mr. Evergreen.

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.840
Mr. Oh comes to revenge by killing him by
himself.

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.400
Mr. Evergreen is waiting for him with his
bodyguard.

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.520
Mr Oh cannot hold himself and tries to kill
him.

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:48.400
But, Mr. Evergreen stops him by telling that
he will not know the reason why he imprisoned

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.840
him for 15 years forever and Mi Do will also
be killed.

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:55.680
He will also kill himself if Mr. Oh doesn’t
find out the answer of the why.

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.960
Mr. Evergreen leaves Mr. Oh who cannot do
anything.

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:03.920
While he backs to Mi Do apartment, the previous
gangster lead by the crime organization’s

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:05.920
owner with Mi Do as hostage.

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:08.560
He wants to take revenge to Mr. Oh by torturing
them.

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:13.760
But, they are stopped by Mr. Evergreen who
also brings a bunch of money to free Mr. Oh.

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:18.560
After this incident, Mr. Oh tells her everything
and they are making love.

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:22.720
Suddenly, a poison gas appears and someone
is coming.

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:27.440
The next day, with suspicious Mr. Oh finally
finds out that there is a tracker on his shoes

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:28.000
all this time.

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:32.240
He and his friends try to solve the mystery
by searching out the meaning of evergreen.

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.280
It leads them to his high school where he
found his face.

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:39.280
There is also a girl who’s very suspicious
that the photo was cropped.

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:44.320
From the call, his friend remembers the name
of this girl and says that this girl was rumored

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:45.280
to be a cheap girl.

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:48.320
Appears that the evergreen is there and kills
his friend.

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:52.320
With his anger he tells Mr. Oh that his sister
was not a cheap girl.

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.600
Suddenly, Mr. Oh can recall his past memory.

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:59.360
Mr. Oh comes to the evergreen building with
his answer.

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:03.440
He explains that the main reason is because
he was the one who spread the rumor of his

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.120
sister as a cheap girl.

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:08.880
He also says that the one who played with
her is no one but his brother.

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:14.000
He saw it by himself and the rumor, that his
sister was pregnant, was spread accidentally.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.240
Afraid that everyone would know his illicit
relationship, he killed his sister.

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:22.560
Mr. Evergreen refuses it by saying that Mr.
Oh’s tongue and the gossip are the ones

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:23.920
who made her pregnant.

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:25.360
He starts to tell him the truth.

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:29.120
Besides imprisoning him, he also hypnotized
him and Mi-Do.

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:34.640
Turns out, Mi-Do is his daughter who has changed
her identity using hypnosis.

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:39.040
Can’t hold himself, Mr. Oh attacks Evergreen
but is defended by his bodyguard.

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:42.240
They fight until the bodyguard wants to kill
him so bad.

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:47.600
Mr. Evergreen kills his bodyguard because
not want Mr. Oh to die so easily.

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:51.440
He must feel the pain for the rest of his
life regarding Mi Do knowing that he is his

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:53.680
father and they also have an illicit relationship.

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:58.880
Mr. Oh begs him so badly and acts like a dog
for not telling his daughter about it.

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:02.560
Because Mr. Evergreen ignores him, he begs
him more by cutting his tongue.

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:07.680
Satisfying with his evil plan , Mr. Evergreen
promises to not tell her and he leaves.

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:13.040
At the end of the movie, Mr. Evergreen kills
himself as he is satisfied with revenge.

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:18.400
Meanwhile, Mr. Oh asks the woman to hypnotize
him to be able to have two personalities,

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:22.160
the one who knows everything and the second
one who does not know the true identity of

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:22.640
Mi Do.

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:26.240
After that, Mi Do is looking for her and hugs
him.

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:28.000
She tells him that she loves him so much.

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:33.280
Mr. Oh is happy to hear that, but no longer
after that, he must endure his pain in whole

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:33.600
life.
