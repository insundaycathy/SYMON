but what did I think of the season
overall<00:10:45.650><c> well</c><00:10:46.340><c> though</c><00:10:46.700><c> I</c><00:10:46.730><c> did</c><00:10:47.000><c> have</c><00:10:47.150><c> a</c><00:10:47.210><c> lot</c><00:10:47.450><c> of</c>

00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:49.870 align:start position:0%
overall well though I did have a lot of

00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:49.880 align:start position:0%
fun with lock and key I actually felt
 

00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:51.310 align:start position:0%
fun with lock and key I actually felt
the<00:10:49.970><c> series</c><00:10:50.390><c> drag</c><00:10:50.630><c> that</c><00:10:50.780><c> some</c><00:10:50.990><c> points</c>

00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:51.320 align:start position:0%
the series drag that some points
 

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:54.010 align:start position:0%
the series drag that some points

00:10:54.010 --> 00:10:54.020 align:start position:0%
especially early on and personally I
 

00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:55.390 align:start position:0%
especially early on and personally I
think<00:10:54.260><c> the</c><00:10:54.590><c> season</c><00:10:55.010><c> could</c><00:10:55.190><c> have</c><00:10:55.280><c> been</c>

00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:55.400 align:start position:0%
think the season could have been
 

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:57.160 align:start position:0%
think the season could have been

00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:57.170 align:start position:0%
shortened by quite a bit and it would
 

00:10:57.170 --> 00:10:58.540 align:start position:0%
shortened by quite a bit and it would
