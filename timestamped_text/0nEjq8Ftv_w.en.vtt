00:00:06.469 --> 00:00:07.813
hey what's up guys

00:00:08.005 --> 00:00:11.717
today I'll show you a science fiction horror film: "Sea Fever" 

00:00:11.973 --> 00:00:14.533
spoiler ahead, watch out and take care

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:19.141
in order to complete her dissertation, a PhD student of biology, Siobhan

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:23.877
has joined a crew of six people on a trawler, setting off for an outing for fish

00:00:24.069 --> 00:00:29.189
at first, everything goes on well, and the trawler arrives at the deep-sea area as planned

00:00:29.445 --> 00:00:32.773
then, they are all very excited to find that there are whales around

00:00:32.901 --> 00:00:34.885
believing they will bring them good luck

00:00:35.013 --> 00:00:40.261
however, Siobhan finds it strange as whales do not usually show up in the fishing area

00:00:40.453 --> 00:00:42.885
she tries to warn the others, but to no avail

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:46.085
people there think she just makes an unnecessary fuss

00:00:46.341 --> 00:00:51.461
later, the skipper couple finds a large haul of fish is moving towards them at a fast speed

00:00:51.653 --> 00:00:55.813
and the next second, the ship is hit heavily by some unknown object

00:00:56.133 --> 00:00:59.397
Siobhan then finds that the texture of the plank on the bottom of the ship 

00:00:59.525 --> 00:01:03.621
seems to have been changed somehow, with numerous tiny bongo packages

00:01:03.941 --> 00:01:06.949
Siobhan pokes one of them, and the plank just breaks apart 

00:01:07.077 --> 00:01:10.725
then, the bongo packages begin to exude some greenish slime 

00:01:10.981 --> 00:01:15.205
moments later, the skipper couple discover that the boat seems to have been tangled up 

00:01:15.269 --> 00:01:16.933
as they cannot move it anymore

00:01:17.125 --> 00:01:21.477
what's worse, in order to catch more fish, they have driven the boat to the exclusion zone

00:01:21.669 --> 00:01:25.253
which is far away from the mainland, and they cannot even call for help

00:01:25.637 --> 00:01:28.645
Siobhan becomes very interested in these unknown creatures 

00:01:28.773 --> 00:01:31.397
she gets some and wants to test what exactly they are

00:01:31.589 --> 00:01:34.661
there, the skipper comes and peels off one of the packages 

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:37.541
and some reddish squirming things get inside the boat

00:01:37.733 --> 00:01:40.677
Siobhan thinks the creature may be some kind of barnacles

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:44.837
in order to figure it out, she decides to dive underneath the water to take a look 

00:01:45.029 --> 00:01:48.549
then, what she sees underwater terrifies her greatly

00:01:48.805 --> 00:01:52.517
the boat is stuck by the tentacles of a giant bio-luminescent creature

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:57.573
there seem to be even sharp teeth on the tentacles, and even a knife cannot cut them off

00:01:57.957 --> 00:02:02.053
in fear of the mysterious creature, Siobhan gets back to the boat right away 

00:02:02.245 --> 00:02:07.237
she tells the others about what she has just seen, but they think it is only a giant squid 

00:02:07.365 --> 00:02:12.549
therefore, they try to capture the creature with a net, but make no success as it is too heavy

00:02:12.741 --> 00:02:16.645
then, one of the crew, Johnny, tries to winch it up under the skipper's order

00:02:16.901 --> 00:02:20.485
however, while releasing the net, Johnny's hand is caught in the winch 

00:02:20.613 --> 00:02:22.725
though eventually freed from the winch

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:25.605
Johnny's hand is seriously injured with blood all over

00:02:25.733 --> 00:02:27.781
Siobhan has a bad feeling about it

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:32.581
not long after the incident, Siobhan sees another fishing ship not far away

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:36.229
she immediately tells the skipper couple that they can make use of the other ship 

00:02:36.293 --> 00:02:38.149
to get rid of the giant "squid"

00:02:38.277 --> 00:02:41.861
however, there is no response after they send out the signal

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:45.637
so Siobhan and two crew members decide to take a rowboat to that ship 

00:02:45.765 --> 00:02:48.965
after arriving, they find no one on the ship at first

00:02:49.157 --> 00:02:51.781
Siobhan tries to use their radio to call for help 

00:02:51.845 --> 00:02:54.981
but surprisingly finds the radio has already been destroyed

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:59.909
then, they walk into the cabin, which is in a total mess, and nobody is there

00:03:00.101 --> 00:03:04.069
it turns out that people on that ship have all died, but not long ago

00:03:04.197 --> 00:03:06.181
all of them are dead in horrible ways

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:10.469
with one bloodied all over his body and another man's eyeballs popped out

00:03:10.597 --> 00:03:13.285
the skipper thinks those people might have sea fever

00:03:13.413 --> 00:03:17.701
a disease that will make people gradually lose mind and even kill each other

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:22.501
as there is no other plausible explanation, and in order not to make the crew panic as well

00:03:22.565 --> 00:03:25.957
the three agree not to say a word about what they see on the ship

00:03:26.085 --> 00:03:29.717
when they return to their ship, the giant "squid" seems to have left the boat

00:03:29.798 --> 00:03:32.230
so the boat can continue with its journey

00:03:32.358 --> 00:03:35.622
however, Siobhan once again argues that it doesn't make sense 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.334
as those marine organisms will never set the prey-at-hand free

00:03:39.462 --> 00:03:42.598
once again, the others don't take her words seriously 

00:03:42.726 --> 00:03:45.350
and the skipper couple continue with the fishing again

00:03:45.542 --> 00:03:49.318
they soon get a good harvest of fish, which greatly cheers the crew up

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.518
however, no one notices the slime on the net

00:03:52.646 --> 00:03:56.294
and Johnny, who has a wound on his hand, even touches the slime

00:03:56.486 --> 00:03:58.982
because of that, Johnny develops a fever soon

00:03:59.046 --> 00:04:01.542
and there seems to be something wrong with his eyes

00:04:01.606 --> 00:04:03.910
seeing that, Siobhan checks Johnny's eyes 

00:04:03.974 --> 00:04:07.302
and is frightened to see something white flashing by in his eye

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.718
however, when the skipper checks his eyes again, the white shade disappears

00:04:11.974 --> 00:04:13.574
Johnny insists that he is fine 

00:04:13.702 --> 00:04:17.414
and others think that Siobhan may be just so nervous that she gets an illusion

00:04:17.606 --> 00:04:21.446
later when Johnny is trying to reduce the discomfort in his eyes with the water

00:04:21.574 --> 00:04:24.902
the discomfort turns into a huge pain and gets severe

00:04:25.094 --> 00:04:28.294
then, Johnny is terrified to find he cannot see anything

00:04:28.422 --> 00:04:31.942
his eyeballs begin to congest and in the end, break apart

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:36.422
the blood rolls down from his eyes, so do the numerous disgusting small worms

00:04:36.614 --> 00:04:39.814
Siobhan realizes that the worms may actually be parasites

00:04:39.942 --> 00:04:41.926
which can be transmitted by the water

00:04:42.054 --> 00:04:45.575
shortly after, Johnny dies due to an excessive loss of blood

00:04:45.575 --> 00:04:47.825
at the same time, when taking a shower

00:04:47.964 --> 00:04:51.996
another crew is horrified to find he also gets infected with the parasites

00:04:52.124 --> 00:04:56.284
tiny holes are spreading all over his body, with blood continuously oozing out

00:04:56.412 --> 00:04:58.972
recalling the dead bodies that they see on the other boat

00:04:59.036 --> 00:05:02.492
Siobhan believes they probably die from the same infection

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.988
in panic, they check the water pipes on the boat 

00:05:05.052 --> 00:05:08.444
and find that the parasites have bitten through the steel water filters

00:05:08.572 --> 00:05:10.556
then Siobhan goes to check the water tank 

00:05:10.684 --> 00:05:13.436
and finds that it is already filled with parasites too

00:05:13.692 --> 00:05:17.788
that is the only freshwater left on the boat now, so everyone is in great panic 

00:05:17.916 --> 00:05:20.604
Siobhan says that the parasites should be saltwater larvae

00:05:20.668 --> 00:05:23.164
meaning that they cannot survive the freshwater

00:05:23.292 --> 00:05:26.044
hearing that, the others finally get a little bit relieved

00:05:26.172 --> 00:05:28.732
however, it doesn't go as Siobhan says

00:05:28.988 --> 00:05:31.292
when she checks the tank several hours later

00:05:31.356 --> 00:05:36.476
she is terrified to find that the parasites are still alive and have even destroyed the net 

00:05:36.604 --> 00:05:39.804
what's worse, the parasites are now starting to eat the boat 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:44.540
so Siobhan collects some of the slimes and takes a closer look at them under the microscope

00:05:44.796 --> 00:05:48.700
she surprisingly finds that those parasites are actually from the slime

00:05:48.828 --> 00:05:52.220
that also suggests it is not a giant squid entangling the boat

00:05:52.348 --> 00:05:55.484
but some mysterious creature that has never been seen before

00:05:55.612 --> 00:05:59.068
the creature must have mistakenly taken the boat as a prey 

00:05:59.196 --> 00:06:01.436
and excretes the slime full of parasites

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:04.124
which will break into human bodies through the wounds

00:06:04.252 --> 00:06:09.052
everyone has some kind of wound caused by fishing, so they are vulnerable to parasites

00:06:09.244 --> 00:06:11.676
in order to prevent the situation from getting worse

00:06:11.804 --> 00:06:15.068
Siobhan suggests they kill all the parasites and their eggs

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:19.228
they try the disinfectant and self-made UV light, but neither of them works

00:06:19.356 --> 00:06:23.132
in desperation, Siobhan comes up with a very risky idea 

00:06:23.324 --> 00:06:25.372
she wants to electrocute the parasites

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:28.508
though they will not get hurt as long as they put on the rubber boots

00:06:28.636 --> 00:06:31.836
there is a huge risk that the boat could get on fire

00:06:32.028 --> 00:06:36.444
however, in the end, they decide to give it a try at this life-or-death moment

00:06:36.636 --> 00:06:38.364
fortunately, it works

00:06:38.492 --> 00:06:41.756
more than half of the parasites have been wiped out in that way

00:06:41.948 --> 00:06:44.060
just as they are about to go ashore now

00:06:44.188 --> 00:06:48.412
Siobhan explains that they should wait 36 hours to ensure that they are all clear

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:51.292
so as to avoid infecting people ashore

00:06:51.548 --> 00:06:56.284
however, no one agrees with her proposal, especially seeing another crew member die 

00:06:56.476 --> 00:06:59.996
in order to stop them, Siobhan throws the rope into the sea

00:07:00.124 --> 00:07:03.708
which then entangles the propeller, forcing the boat to a violent stop

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:07.356
the others get so mad at Siobhan, but they have to accept it now

00:07:07.548 --> 00:07:09.916
Siobhan then starts to check all the members' eyes 

00:07:10.044 --> 00:07:12.540
and finds that only the skipper has been infected

00:07:12.668 --> 00:07:17.788
then, the skipper confesses that he changed course to the exclusion zone, causing all this

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:22.524
and in order to reduce his pain, he then asks his wife to end his miserable life

00:07:22.716 --> 00:07:26.044
after that, just when the rest of them think they are finally safe now

00:07:26.236 --> 00:07:30.268
an old woman starts to act weirdly and even tries to strangle Siobhan

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:34.556
in a mess, Siobhan knocks the old woman off the ladder and kills her

00:07:34.812 --> 00:07:38.588
to their shock, the tear shed from her eye turns out to be a living parasite

00:07:38.716 --> 00:07:41.596
indicating the old woman is also infected 

00:07:41.852 --> 00:07:44.988
by now, the skipper's wife can no longer bear all this

00:07:45.116 --> 00:07:47.292
she takes a rowboat and leaves alone

00:07:47.484 --> 00:07:52.412
now, there are only two people on the boat, Siobhan and another crew member, Omid

00:07:52.604 --> 00:07:54.652
the two then hear some noise from the tank

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:59.004
they immediately go upstairs to check and find that the parasites are now all over the tank

00:07:59.132 --> 00:08:01.948
indicating that they can also live in the freshwater

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:05.532
Siobhan and Omid decide to kill them by heat, but it doesn't work

00:08:05.788 --> 00:08:10.524
to make things worse, the unknown creature comes back and eats through the bottom of the boat

00:08:10.716 --> 00:08:15.516
as the boat begins to sink, they have no choice, but to abandon the boat and take the raft 

00:08:15.772 --> 00:08:19.100
Siobhan sets the boat on fire and jumps onto the raft

00:08:19.292 --> 00:08:24.924
Omid cannot swim, but he accidentally falls into the sea and is pulled deep down by the creature

00:08:25.308 --> 00:08:28.828
Siobhan cannot stand seeing Omid dying like this in front of her

00:08:28.956 --> 00:08:31.132
she then jumps into the sea to save him

00:08:31.324 --> 00:08:35.740
just then, they surprisingly notice that there is another fishing boat moving towards them

00:08:35.868 --> 00:08:37.788
thinking they can finally be saved

00:08:37.916 --> 00:08:43.125
however, Siobhan suddenly declares that she is infected, showing Omid the cut on her wrist

00:08:43.125 --> 00:08:46.700
it turns out that she was cut by a tentacle when rescuing Omid

00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:48.954
Siobhan bids her last goodbye to Omid 

00:08:49.018 --> 00:08:52.858
before jumping into the sea and swimming down towards the unknown creature

00:08:53.114 --> 00:08:58.874
in the end, Omid becomes the only survivor, but no one knows whether he is infected or not

00:08:59.258 --> 00:09:01.882
this's Daniel CC movie channel, peace out
