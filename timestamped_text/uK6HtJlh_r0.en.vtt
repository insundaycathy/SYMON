00:00:06.332 --> 00:00:07.772
hey what's up guys

00:00:08.012 --> 00:00:12.140
today I'll show you a science fantasy horror film: "Victor Frankenstein"

00:00:12.332 --> 00:00:14.924
spoiler ahead, watch out and take care

00:00:15.308 --> 00:00:19.820
at a circus in London, an ugly nameless hunchback works as a joker for a living

00:00:19.964 --> 00:00:23.516
he is constantly bullied by other circus folks for his hideous appearance

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.412
despite his ugly looks, he also has his own hormone idol, the aerialist Lorelei

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.012
he admires her for long, and dreams to assist her someday

00:00:32.156 --> 00:00:35.564
he even learns human anatomy by himself from the stolen books

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.364
intending to offer his help to Lorelei, who often suffers injuries from dangerous actions

00:00:40.556 --> 00:00:45.740
one day, Lorelei falls during the performance, and hits on the ground with a bad injury

00:00:45.836 --> 00:00:48.572
the hunchback rushes to her and examines her

00:00:48.764 --> 00:00:51.836
a medical student Victor, also rushes to help

00:00:51.932 --> 00:00:56.300
after examination, the hunchback believes that the fall causes a clavicle fracture

00:00:56.348 --> 00:01:00.236
which pressures Lorelei's lungs, and makes it hard for her to breathe

00:01:00.332 --> 00:01:04.412
there is nowhere to find any proper medical equipment during that urgent moment

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.740
the hunchback borrows Victor's pocket watch, and presses it against Lorelei's collarbone

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.400
then, hunchback pushes the broken bone back to the right position

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.325
and Lorelei gets her breath back

00:01:15.325 --> 00:01:18.700
Victor is amazed by the hunchback's skill and medical knowledge

00:01:18.769 --> 00:01:22.801
and tries to persuade him to leave the circus and study more about medicine

00:01:22.945 --> 00:01:26.017
however, the hunchback is too afraid to leave the circus 

00:01:26.113 --> 00:01:28.513
and his master just locks him up because of that

00:01:28.657 --> 00:01:31.825
later, at night after stealing some dead animals' body parts 

00:01:31.921 --> 00:01:34.081
Victor frees the hunchback from a locked cage 

00:01:34.177 --> 00:01:37.585
and manages to escape the enraged circus master and his men 

00:01:37.681 --> 00:01:42.529
after taking him back home, Victor drains the disgusting cyst on the hunchback's back

00:01:42.625 --> 00:01:47.473
that causes his physical abnormality and gives him a harness to improve his posture

00:01:47.665 --> 00:01:50.525
the hunchback looks just like a normal person now 

00:01:50.725 --> 00:01:53.557
then, Victor names the hunchback Igor

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:56.053
after cleaning himself and a haircut

00:01:56.197 --> 00:01:58.789
Igor has transformed into a handsome young man 

00:01:59.077 --> 00:02:03.925
later that night, Victor explains that he notices Igor's talent in medical science

00:02:04.165 --> 00:02:08.725
he shows Igor a tank that contains a pair of pale eyes soaked in some liquid 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.813
much to his surprise, the eyes can even respond to match light after being electrified

00:02:14.053 --> 00:02:17.653
Igor becomes so interested and points out Victor's mistakes

00:02:17.893 --> 00:02:23.029
Victor is thrilled to hear Igor's advice and invites Igor to be his assistant immediately

00:02:23.221 --> 00:02:27.973
while Igor finds meaning in his life and therefore accepts Victor's invitation

00:02:28.357 --> 00:02:32.005
in the coming days, Igor helps Victor to test on the animal organs

00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:34.933
trying to revive the organ by electric shock

00:02:35.077 --> 00:02:37.861
they become very close partners and friends 

00:02:38.005 --> 00:02:40.885
one day, Victor takes Igor to a dance party

00:02:41.077 --> 00:02:43.477
at the party, Igor encounters Lorelei 

00:02:43.525 --> 00:02:46.165
who is masquerading as a mistress of a gay baron

00:02:46.261 --> 00:02:51.973
Lorelei recognizes Igor straightway and expresses her great shock at his handsome looking

00:02:52.261 --> 00:02:54.277
she also thanks him for rescuing her 

00:02:54.421 --> 00:02:59.221
Victor joins the two and talks about his ongoing wicked experiments to resurrect life 

00:02:59.365 --> 00:03:00.661
through artificial means 

00:03:00.757 --> 00:03:05.413
after the party finishes, Victor takes Igor to a basement to watch their research achievement

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:09.781
a monstrous chimpanzee-like creature made by the restored dead animals' organs 

00:03:10.117 --> 00:03:14.437
once Victor turns on the electricity, the current goes through the creature's body

00:03:14.725 --> 00:03:17.797
surprisingly, the creature breathes seconds later

00:03:17.893 --> 00:03:20.485
the two are excited about their huge success

00:03:20.965 --> 00:03:25.475
Victor invites Igor as his partner to attend his academic report at his university 

00:03:25.475 --> 00:03:29.557
in a big hall, an arrogant, wealthy oily hair classmate of Victor

00:03:29.653 --> 00:03:32.725
and a few other students and Lorelei, invited by Igor

00:03:32.869 --> 00:03:35.221
are waiting to see Victor's demonstration

00:03:35.557 --> 00:03:39.013
the Oily Hair urges them to start their experiment impatiently

00:03:39.301 --> 00:03:42.373
the creature is not alive after Igor turns on the electricity 

00:03:42.661 --> 00:03:46.117
however, flies from the dead creature's body fly out of it 

00:03:46.405 --> 00:03:49.093
students storm out after the gross and horrible scene 

00:03:49.285 --> 00:03:52.021
the Oily Hair mocks Victor's ridiculous failure

00:03:52.213 --> 00:03:56.485
while Victor tries hard to activate the creature with stronger electric stimulation

00:03:56.773 --> 00:04:00.373
after few tries, the creature becomes alive and stands up 

00:04:00.565 --> 00:04:03.397
soon it turns crazy and escapes from the hall

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:06.565
Igor chases after the creature but gets attacked

00:04:06.661 --> 00:04:10.261
Victor rushes to help and realizes that though the creature is alive 

00:04:10.357 --> 00:04:12.949
it has no consciousness to guide its behaviors 

00:04:13.141 --> 00:04:16.501
with deep regrets, Victor kills the creature he created

00:04:16.693 --> 00:04:21.637
surprisingly after that, the Oily Hair shows her great interest in Victor's research

00:04:21.685 --> 00:04:24.181
and promises to fund them to restart from scratch 

00:04:24.181 --> 00:04:26.581
as long as he can get hold of the technology 

00:04:26.677 --> 00:04:30.037
when Victor successfully brings something dead back to live

00:04:30.373 --> 00:04:32.581
the financial support raises Victor's ambition

00:04:32.677 --> 00:04:35.893
he claims that he will create a humanoid creature with a soul

00:04:36.037 --> 00:04:40.405
on account of the danger in further research and Victor's uncontrollable desire

00:04:40.501 --> 00:04:45.157
Igor tries to convince Victor to stop this inhuman experiment but to no avail

00:04:45.445 --> 00:04:49.045
the mysterious creature attack case raises a detective's suspicion

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:51.589
he relates the incident with what happened in the circus 

00:04:51.685 --> 00:04:53.653
where the claw of a lion was found

00:04:53.701 --> 00:04:57.781
he then assures that Victor is responsible for the missing lion claws in the circus 

00:04:57.877 --> 00:05:00.469
and some other dead animals in other areas

00:05:00.709 --> 00:05:05.941
he believes that bringing corpses back to life is a huge unbearable profanity to God

00:05:06.181 --> 00:05:11.029
so later, he finds Victor and gives warnings with no shreds of solid evidence 

00:05:11.269 --> 00:05:14.389
but Victor doesn't give a shit about what the detective said 

00:05:14.533 --> 00:05:18.517
Lorelei meets Igor and tells him her opinions about their research 

00:05:18.613 --> 00:05:21.275
that curing a dying person is completely different from 

00:05:21.275 --> 00:05:24.037
creating something that never belongs to the living world

00:05:24.181 --> 00:05:28.309
she hopes Igor and Victor can stop before things go seriously wrong 

00:05:28.549 --> 00:05:33.253
but Igor worships Victor as a savior who reforms him and inspires his talent

00:05:33.637 --> 00:05:37.573
back to Victor's home, Igor improves some flaws in Victor's plan 

00:05:37.813 --> 00:05:41.317
they agree on using lightning power to keep their creation alive 

00:05:41.509 --> 00:05:45.349
the next morning, Igor finds the detective is trying to break into Victor's home

00:05:45.493 --> 00:05:46.885
with many other policemen

00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:51.301
Igor sneaks in from the back door and warns Victor to run away immediately

00:05:51.637 --> 00:05:53.893
upon hearing the detective's shouting outside

00:05:54.133 --> 00:05:57.445
Victor informs Igor to open the drain for them to escape 

00:05:57.637 --> 00:06:03.301
in the chaos, Igor is horrified to discover a massive ice block that contains a dead body

00:06:03.637 --> 00:06:07.093
just when he challenges Victor in anger for an explanation about that

00:06:07.189 --> 00:06:11.269
the detective makes his way into the house and points his gun at Victor

00:06:11.557 --> 00:06:15.685
Victor fights with the detective and breaks the detective's hand in running gear

00:06:15.829 --> 00:06:20.245
Igor picks up Victor's pocket watch that is dropped on the floor during the fighting 

00:06:20.485 --> 00:06:22.309
and escapes away from the drain

00:06:22.549 --> 00:06:25.765
moments later, they come to the Oily Hair's house for help 

00:06:25.957 --> 00:06:30.901
the Oily Hair says they can continue their research in a countryside castle owned by him

00:06:31.141 --> 00:06:34.309
however, after all the troubles caused by their research

00:06:34.405 --> 00:06:37.375
Igor feels exhausted and confesses that 

00:06:37.375 --> 00:06:40.117
he doesn't want to continue the resurrection experiments anymore 

00:06:40.331 --> 00:06:42.827
Victor decides to keep researching on his own

00:06:43.019 --> 00:06:45.611
the Oily Hair overhears the two's argument 

00:06:45.707 --> 00:06:49.979
and decides to kill the useless Igor so as to keep the research secret

00:06:50.123 --> 00:06:53.483
shortly after, Igor is tied up and thrown into a river 

00:06:53.723 --> 00:06:55.900
thanks for the tricks he learned from the circus

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:59.243
Igor escapes and stays at Lorelei's place to recover

00:06:59.387 --> 00:07:02.027
he notices a name inside the pocket watch 

00:07:02.171 --> 00:07:04.907
which recalls him of the tragedy Victor told him

00:07:05.051 --> 00:07:07.835
Victor's brother, the former owner of the pocket watch

00:07:07.931 --> 00:07:10.379
is killed in a snowstorm for saving Victor

00:07:10.475 --> 00:07:14.795
Igor suddenly realizes the reason for Victor's obsession with the resurrection

00:07:14.891 --> 00:07:19.259
his research purpose is nothing else but bringing his dead brother back 

00:07:19.403 --> 00:07:21.947
he also knows that the Oily Hair will kill Victor 

00:07:22.043 --> 00:07:24.635
as soon as he could get Victor's research result

00:07:24.731 --> 00:07:27.227
therefore, Igor is determined to save Victor 

00:07:27.323 --> 00:07:29.387
while Lorelei wants to go help him 

00:07:29.483 --> 00:07:33.563
meanwhile, Victor is busy preparing his equipment for his final experiment

00:07:33.803 --> 00:07:36.347
while Igor and Lorelei rush to the castle

00:07:36.443 --> 00:07:39.227
Lorelei distracts some guards not far from the castle 

00:07:39.275 --> 00:07:41.387
and discovers the detective in the woods 

00:07:41.579 --> 00:07:44.891
Igor runs into the woods when the guards are not paying attention 

00:07:44.939 --> 00:07:47.579
and finds the busy Victor on the top of the castle  

00:07:47.819 --> 00:07:49.499
Victor is happy to see Igor back 

00:07:49.595 --> 00:07:53.675
but won't listen to Igor's warnings and suggestions to stop the research 

00:07:53.915 --> 00:07:57.323
in huge regrets for his dead brother who was frozen to death 

00:07:57.371 --> 00:08:00.443
he cares no more but only to resurrect his brother 

00:08:00.635 --> 00:08:03.803
as the storm is coming, Victor rushes back to his experiment

00:08:03.899 --> 00:08:06.825
and gives the order to pull the icy dead body up in the air

00:08:06.825 --> 00:08:08.795
waiting for God's power

00:08:08.891 --> 00:08:12.635
soon after, when the lightning hits the balloon floating up in the sky

00:08:12.827 --> 00:08:15.755
a huge amount of electric current runs down the conduct 

00:08:15.803 --> 00:08:17.387
and goes through the body 

00:08:17.483 --> 00:08:20.171
all people below are watching anxiously for the miracle 

00:08:20.267 --> 00:08:24.025
and suddenly, they are excited to see the dead body begin to breathe

00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:27.725
however, soon after, an overload occurs to all the machinery 

00:08:27.899 --> 00:08:32.555
resulting in a powerful explosion and causing the carriage cable to snap suddenly

00:08:32.747 --> 00:08:37.019
the Oily Hair and his servant fall from the top of the castle to their death

00:08:37.211 --> 00:08:41.051
right then, the detective arrives and blames Victor for his insanity

00:08:41.195 --> 00:08:44.125
while everyone is arguing, a horrible human-like monster

00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:46.018
walks out of the dense smoke

00:08:46.114 --> 00:08:49.762
however, in no fear, Victor ignores the detective's warnings 

00:08:49.954 --> 00:08:52.258
and stands in front of the monster with excitement

00:08:52.306 --> 00:08:54.994
for he sees the monster as his resurrected brother 

00:08:55.234 --> 00:08:58.210
he touches it, hoping to wake it up to its consciousness 

00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:01.330
however, the monster gives no response

00:09:01.618 --> 00:09:04.258
the detective shoots at the monster to protect Victor

00:09:04.354 --> 00:09:08.098
with two hearts and four lungs, the monster won't get hurt much

00:09:08.434 --> 00:09:11.506
but it is turned into a rage and throws Victor aside 

00:09:11.842 --> 00:09:16.402
the shocked detective opens fire again but gets killed due to its fatal blow

00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:19.725
Victor realizes that he fails his resurrection dream

00:09:19.888 --> 00:09:22.912
but creates a ruthless monster with no human soul

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:27.520
returning to his senses, Victor joins forces with Igor to kill the monster 

00:09:27.808 --> 00:09:31.888
after a fierce fight, Igor stabs its one heart but to no avail 

00:09:32.032 --> 00:09:35.824
later, Victor seizes the chance to give a fatal shot to its second heart

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:37.360
killing it at last

00:09:37.744 --> 00:09:40.528
the next morning, Igor reunites with Lorelei

00:09:40.816 --> 00:09:45.280
she hands Igor a letter from Victor, who has already set foot for his next discovery

00:09:45.664 --> 00:09:49.216
in the letter, Victor recognizes Igor as his "greatest creation"

00:09:49.312 --> 00:09:52.336
he apologizes for all the sufferings he caused to him

00:09:52.432 --> 00:09:55.840
and wishes a happy hormone life for Igor and Lorelei

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:59.296
