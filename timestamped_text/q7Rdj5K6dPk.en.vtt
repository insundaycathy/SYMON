00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.840
A Family Is Staying At a Secluded Mobile Home Park&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.280
And Gets Stalked And Hunted&nbsp;
By Three Masked Psychopaths

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:14.160
Scary Recap here. Today, I'm going to&nbsp;
explain a horror, slasher- thriller film&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.280
called "The Strangers: Prey at Night."&nbsp;
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:31.040
A van with three masked strangers pulls up to&nbsp;
one trailer in a dark and secluded trailer park&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.920
in Kalida, Ohio. One among them-&nbsp;
a blonde woman- known as Dollface&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.760
knocks on the door of the trailer where&nbsp;
a couple lives, waking up the woman.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:45.040
Upon investigating, she finds a van&nbsp;
outside her house with the radio on.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:50.720
She is shocked to find Dollface already in the&nbsp;
house. It is implied that the wife is killed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:56.400
off-screen, and another killer, Pin-Up Girl, lies&nbsp;
down in bed next to the woman's husband eerily.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:02.640
Elsewhere, Mike and Cindy are getting ready for&nbsp;
a trip along with their defiant daughter Kinsey.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.600
Their plan is for a getaway at their Uncle&nbsp;
Marvin's home at Gatlin Lake before sending off&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:13.680
Kinsey to a boarding school due to a history of&nbsp;
unruly behavior, which Cindy is not happy about.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.720
They pick their son Luke from a nearby park&nbsp;
as he is playing a game with his friends.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.240
Later that night, they stop at a diner. Unhappy&nbsp;
about being sent off to a boarding school,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.400
Kinsey steps outside for a cigarette.&nbsp;
Cindy goes out to talk to her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.640
but Kinsey lets her know that she doesn't&nbsp;
deserve this kind of treatment from her parents.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.320
They reach Gatlin Lake Getaway. Mike and&nbsp;
Cindy are surprised to find that the place&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.520
is strangely isolated. They were surprised,&nbsp;
mainly because the area is a campsite and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.160
is meant to have people living in other&nbsp;
cabins. But, since it's an off-season,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:53.440
the place is conveniently, entirely empty.&nbsp;
The family arrives at the trailer park,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.240
and Cindy enters the leading shop to find&nbsp;
that Marvin had left the key and a note&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:04.480
saying they can meet in the morning. They&nbsp;
reach trailer no. 47, a secluded home. Soon,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:10.400
they hear a knock on the door. Cindy opens the&nbsp;
door to find Dollface, this time without a mask,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:15.600
but her face is covered in darkness. Cindy asks&nbsp;
her if she is lost and if she needs to call&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:22.240
someone. Dollface asks for someone named Tamara&nbsp;
before leaving. The psychopath killers begin their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:27.920
game. The couple had no reason right now to be&nbsp;
worried about this random blonde girl. Mike tries&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.040
to convince Kinsey about their decision to send&nbsp;
her to a boarding school. A frustrated Kinsey&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.160
leaves the trailer to get away from everyone. Luke&nbsp;
is asked by his parents to try to talk to her.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.360
Luke finds Kinsey shuddering, and the&nbsp;
two continue their sibling squabble.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.600
Back at the family trailer, Dollface&nbsp;
shows up and asks for Tamara again!&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:53.360
Cindy and Mike find the blonde girl weird&nbsp;
and leave to see the kids. Luke and Kinsey,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:59.280
meanwhile, walk together until they come across&nbsp;
a bizarre trailer that is left open. Soon after&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.960
entering the trailer, they hear a banging sound.&nbsp;
They opened the door to find a dog running out,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:10.640
yelping. They notice a rotten smell coming&nbsp;
from one of the rooms. Inside the room,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:16.640
Mike finds "hello" written on the window several&nbsp;
times in red before Kinsey discovers her uncle's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:22.880
mutilated corpse covered with a sheet. Terrified&nbsp;
and panicked by the sight of it, Kinsey and Luke&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:28.000
run out of the trailer. Cindy and Mike run-up&nbsp;
to their children to find them petrified.

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:34.400
Luke and Kinsey say that they found the bodies&nbsp;
of Uncle Marvin and their Aunt Sheryl all cut up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:40.080
and drenched in blood. They are a couple murdered&nbsp;
in the opening scene. Mike believes them after a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:45.840
slight hesitation. He asks Cindy to take Kinsey&nbsp;
back home, call the police and lock the door.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.760
Mike and Luke, on the other hand,&nbsp;
go back to Marvin's trailer.

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:56.960
Horrified and shocked by the experience, Kinsey&nbsp;
sobs after reaching their trailer. Cindy and Kinsy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:01.840
are even more panic-stricken when they find out&nbsp;
their phones have been smashed. One of the cell&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:07.200
phones works just enough for Cindy to make a&nbsp;
call. But she is interrupted by Dollface, who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:12.800
appears behind them, a little later. This time,&nbsp;
she is wearing a mask and is seen scratching her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:18.480
knife across the counter. Kinsey and Cindy manage&nbsp;
to somehow lock themselves into the bathroom. But&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:23.760
the threat of them being killed is still genuine.&nbsp;
Kinsey manages to get out of the bathroom through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:29.360
an opening in the ceiling. She tries to help&nbsp;
Cindy climb atop but fails, as Dollface breaks in.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.600
Cindy pleads with Kinsey to escape and save&nbsp;
herself. Dollface brutally stabs Cindy to death&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:40.800
from behind as Kinsey watches before fleeing.
It seems that the killers can assert their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:46.080
dominance over the fate of the family over&nbsp;
and over, seemingly, always one step ahead.

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:53.200
A creepy smiley is seen as a signboard outside the&nbsp;
trailer. Mike and Luke find Marvin and Sheryl's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:58.320
mutilated bodies and decide to call cops before&nbsp;
realizing they left their phones back at their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:03.840
trailer. There, they find the voicemail that&nbsp;
Cindy left for their uncle informing them about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:08.960
their late arrival. Luke and Mike realize&nbsp;
that the offenders were, in fact, waiting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:14.720
for their arrival. All of a sudden, they hear&nbsp;
a banging noise and a squeaking swing outside.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:20.320
They realize that they are being stalked by a&nbsp;
Masked Man wielding an axe. Mike finds a gun&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:25.280
inside the trailer, loads it, and threatens to&nbsp;
use it on the masked man if he doesn't leave.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:30.480
But after he brilliantly flings the door&nbsp;
open, not knowing what's on the other side,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:36.640
the Masked Man disappears. Luke and Mike run&nbsp;
away from the trailer to find Cindy and Kinsey.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:42.800
There they find Cindy dead and a similar smiley&nbsp;
face. They take their van to find Kinsey, only for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:47.680
the Masked Man to throw a brick at the windshield,&nbsp;
forcing the van to crash into another trailer.

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:53.840
Simultaneously, Kinsey is running for&nbsp;
her life after being spotted by Dollface.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:59.360
Panting, whimpering, and sobbing, she runs&nbsp;
into a car with the radio on. In the car is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:05.840
another masked man. She is now being pursued by&nbsp;
three psychopaths. The masked Man chases Kinsey.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:11.600
Although she finds a hiding spot, it is of no&nbsp;
use. She was quickly spotted and screamed to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:17.040
be left alone. But the Pin-Up Girl emerges from&nbsp;
behind and says they're just getting started!

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:21.920
After the two get their consciousness&nbsp;
back at the car, Luke discovers that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:27.360
Mike is pinned to the seat by a wooden piece of&nbsp;
trailer's porch. Mike wants Luke to run away,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:32.960
but Luke doesn't want to leave his dad alone. Mike&nbsp;
motivates his son to go find his sister and asks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:38.240
him to take the gun with him. Luke promises to&nbsp;
find Kinsey, call the cops and get an ambulance.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:43.440
An emotional Mike lets Luke know that&nbsp;
he is proud of him. After Luke leaves,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:49.040
Mike finds himself face to face with the masked&nbsp;
man with nowhere to go. He pleads to the masked&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:54.080
man to leave his family alone. But it is of&nbsp;
no use as the Man in the Mask stabs him in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:59.440
throat with an ice pick in their typical fashion-&nbsp;
after taunting them by playing music in the car.

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:05.280
Kinsey manages to somehow run away again&nbsp;
at a distance, but death still seems to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:10.000
within a touching distance for her. Kinsey&nbsp;
runs back to their trailer. She hears a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.240
strange noise coming from the other room,&nbsp;
finding a jack in the box on the ground,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:19.120
and Dollface, nearby, reveals herself&nbsp;
with a high-pitched squeak and moaning.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:25.280
Dollface stabs Kinsey, but Luke arrives just in&nbsp;
time to save her and holds Dollface at gunpoint.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:31.520
Dollface laughs insanely and asks whether he&nbsp;
is gonna shoot her. He doesn't hit, which would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:36.880
turn out to be a costly mistake later. He grabs&nbsp;
Kinsey and runs, and they reach another trailer.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:42.960
There Kinsey is upset she couldn't save her mother&nbsp;
and blames herself for being late for the trip.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:48.720
But Luke tries to calm her down while he tends to&nbsp;
Kinsey's wounds. Then, the masked Man rams into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:54.640
the trailer with his truck, forcing the siblings&nbsp;
to run. Unfortunately, Luke leaves his gun behind.

00:07:55.520 --> 00:08:00.560
Realizing that Kinsey can't run, Luke leaves her&nbsp;
under a porch while he goes to the main office to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:06.560
get help. He manages to call 911 from there but&nbsp;
loses connection midway while trying to remember&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:12.240
his exact location. Now, the masked psychopaths&nbsp;
had rounded him off and messed with the power.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:16.880
As always, they turned the music&nbsp;
on as Luke grabbed a golf club.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:21.920
He sees the Pin-Up girl and runs towards the pool,&nbsp;
where he manages to whack her with the golf club.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:28.240
The killers turn on the area's lights, set the&nbsp;
soundtrack for the kill. Thus, the psychopaths are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:34.400
trying to establish an ambiance for murder. Just&nbsp;
as he tries to unmask her, she tries to stab him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:38.800
But, Luke manages to get the knife from&nbsp;
her and stabs her to death instead.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:45.120
Moments later, the Masked Man shows up with his&nbsp;
axe and chases Luke. The two fall in the pool&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:50.880
and fight for their lives. Eventually, the Man&nbsp;
in the Mask gets the upper hand and stabs Luke,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:56.240
leaving him to bleed out in the pool. Kinsey finds&nbsp;
Luke and manages to hide him while she tries to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:02.240
get help. Limping her way to find some help, she&nbsp;
comes across a police van. She asks the officer to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:08.240
help her, only for Dollface to slash his throat.&nbsp;
Kinsey tries to escape in the officer's van but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:15.120
realizes Dollface has the key! Ready to savor the&nbsp;
prey, Dollface opens the door and starts slashing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:20.960
Kinsey. But Kinsey grabs the officer's rifle&nbsp;
and shoots Dollface away. Kinsey takes off her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:26.720
Mask and asks her why she is doing this, to which&nbsp;
Dollface replies with a bloody smile, "Why not?'&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:32.960
Kinsey finishes her off with another shot.&nbsp;
Kinsey then tries to drive back to find Luke.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:38.880
But the Masked Man appears again, in a huge van.&nbsp;
He rams into the police car in which Kinsey is.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:44.720
Kinsey has nowhere to go as her vehicle doesn't&nbsp;
start. The masked man continues to ram into the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:49.840
vehicle multiple times until Kinsey gets out&nbsp;
of it. She notices the cars are leaking fuel.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:56.080
She grabs her lighter and throws it at the cars,&nbsp;
causing them to explode. However, the masked Man&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:56.080 --> 00:10:01.280
survives the explosion extraordinarily and&nbsp;
chases her into the car, already in flames.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:07.120
They reach a bridge, where he gets out of the&nbsp;
car with his ax, only to drop to his knees.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:11.600
He pulls a piece of glass out of his abdomen&nbsp;
and then falls to the ground, apparently dead.

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:17.280
Kinsey spots another van and flags it down&nbsp;
for help. The woman in the car approaches&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:22.480
her for help but then backs off after seeing&nbsp;
the masked Man behind Kinsey, still alive!&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:27.120
The woman starts the vehicle, and Kinsey&nbsp;
manages to climb into the truck's bed with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:32.800
the masked Man following slowly. He too climbs&nbsp;
into it, but just when he tries to get Kinsey,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:38.880
she grabs a bat and knocks him out once and&nbsp;
for all. She is relieved, exhausted, sad,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:44.480
and terrified all at once as she finally manages&nbsp;
to escape from what has been a terrible getaway.

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:50.800
Sometime later, Kinsey wakes up from a nightmare.&nbsp;
Kinsey realizes she is in a hospital with her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:56.720
brother, Luke. Luke is still recovering from his&nbsp;
injuries and has yet to gain consciousness. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:56.720 --> 00:11:02.800
feeling of survival made her kiss his forehead.&nbsp;
Just as Kinsey goes to get water for herself, once&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:08.480
again, she hears a knock at the door, as well as&nbsp;
the distinct sound of a jack-in-the-box Dollface&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:15.280
used earlier in the park., just as before, as the&nbsp;
film ends. Are the killers really dead? In the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:20.560
end, probably at least one of the psychopaths&nbsp;
survived and is waiting for Kinsie and Luke!

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:26.640
Yes, and that's about it. For more videos&nbsp;
