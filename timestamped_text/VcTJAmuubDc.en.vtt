00:00:08.925 --> 00:00:09.120
Loki

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.240
Loki is arrested by the Time Variance&nbsp;
Authority (also known as the TVA)&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:20.800
when he creates a new timeline after escaping from&nbsp;
the Battle of New York with the Tesseract in 2012,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:28.320
during the events of Avengers: Endgame. The TVA&nbsp;
resets the timeline, and this "variant" Loki&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.400
stands trial in front of Judge Ravonna Renslayer&nbsp;
for crimes against the "Sacred Timeline".&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:40.560
Loki blames the situation on the Avengers, who had&nbsp;
traveled back in time to 2012, but Renslayer says&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:47.520
their actions were meant to happen unlike Loki's&nbsp;
escape. Agent Mobius M. Mobius takes Loki to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.520
the Time Theater to review his past misdeeds and&nbsp;
question his history of hurting people. He reveals&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.840
that Loki, in his intended future, inadvertently&nbsp;
causes the death of his adoptive mother Frigga.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:05.120
Loki attempts to escape, but gives up after&nbsp;
realizing that the TVA's power exceeds that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:10.720
of the Infinity Stones. He returns to the&nbsp;
Time Theater and watches more future events,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:16.320
including his own death at the hands of Thanos.&nbsp;
He then agrees to help Mobius hunt another Loki&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.000
variant who has killed several TVA agents&nbsp;
and stolen their timeline-resetting charges.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:29.120
Loki joins a TVA mission to the site of an attack&nbsp;
by "The Variant" in 1985 Oshkosh, Wisconsin,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:34.560
where he stalls and attempts to bargain his way&nbsp;
into meeting the Time-Keepers, who created the TVA&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.840
and the Sacred Timeline. Renslayer objects to&nbsp;
Loki's further involvement, but Mobius convinces&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.440
her to give him another chance. Loki researches&nbsp;
TVA files and theorizes that the Variant is hiding&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.640
near apocalyptic events where their actions&nbsp;
do not affect the timeline. Loki and Mobius&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:57.120
confirm this possibility by visiting Pompeii&nbsp;
in 79 AD, before deducing that the Variant is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:03.280
hiding during a hurricane in 2050 Alabama. There,&nbsp;
they are ambushed by the Variant, who possesses&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:10.160
the bodies of several locals and TVA agent Hunter&nbsp;
B-15. The Variant reveals herself to be a female&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.600
version of Loki and rejects his offer to overthrow&nbsp;
the Time-Keepers together. She sends the stolen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.960
reset charges to various points along the Sacred&nbsp;
Timeline, which activate and create numerous&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:26.960
branched timelines that throw the TVA into&nbsp;
disarray. She teleports away and Loki follows her.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:33.040
The Variant arrives at the TVA and attempts to&nbsp;
find the Time-Keepers, followed by Loki, who uses&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:40.240
a TemPad to teleport them both away and escape&nbsp;
from Renslayer. They arrive at 2077 Lamentis-1,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:45.920
a moon that is soon to be crushed by a planet, and&nbsp;
the TemPad runs out of power. Loki magically hides&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:51.600
it, and the Variant, who goes by the alias Sylvie,&nbsp;
agrees to work with him to charge it. They sneak&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.560
aboard a train bound for the ark, an evacuation&nbsp;
spaceship, which they believe can recharge the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.680
TemPad. Loki gets drunk and starts a ruckus,&nbsp;
leading to a fight with guards who eventually&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:07.440
throw him off the train. Sylvie follows him, only&nbsp;
to find the TemPad broken, and the duo decide to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.720
finish the journey on foot and commandeer the ark&nbsp;
so they can use it to escape. Sylvie reveals that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:18.880
the TVA's workers are all variants and were not&nbsp;
created by the Time-Keepers as Mobius claimed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.520
Loki and Sylvie fight their way through guards&nbsp;
and a crowd of people attempting to board the ark.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:28.080
Before they get there, meteors from&nbsp;
the oncoming planet destroy the ark.

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:34.960
On Lamentis-1, Sylvie tells Loki she escaped the&nbsp;
TVA's detention as a child. Loki and Sylvie form&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:40.880
a romantic bond, creating a unique branched&nbsp;
timeline that draws the attention of the TVA&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:46.240
and allows for their rescue before Lamentis is&nbsp;
destroyed. They are both arrested, and Mobius&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:52.640
leaves Loki in a time loop from his past with&nbsp;
Sif. Mobius and Hunter B-15 realize they are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:58.320
variants after interrogating Loki and Sylvie.&nbsp;
Mobius subsequently frees Loki from the loop,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:04.320
but Renslayer confronts them and orders Mobius to&nbsp;
be "pruned". Renslayer takes Loki and Sylvie to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:11.040
the Time-Keepers before Hunter B-15 intervenes&nbsp;
and frees them of their time twisting collars.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:16.160
Loki and Sylvie kill the Time-Keepers' guards&nbsp;
and Sylvie knocks Renslayer unconscious.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:21.280
Sylvie then beheads one of the Time-Keepers,&nbsp;
revealing them to be androids. Loki prepares&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.680
to tell Sylvie something, but Renslayer&nbsp;
regains consciousness and prunes him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:31.600
Angered, Sylvie overpowers her and demands the&nbsp;
truth about the TVA. In a mid-credits scene, Loki&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:37.280
awakens in an unknown realm, surrounded by several&nbsp;
other Loki variants who invite him to join them.

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.200
Sylvie learns from Renslayer that&nbsp;
Loki was teleported to the Void,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:47.120
a dimension at the end of Time where everything&nbsp;
the TVA prunes is dumped into. Meanwhile, Loki&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:52.800
learns from his other variants that a cloud-like&nbsp;
creature named Alioth guards the Void and prevents&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:58.880
anyone from escaping. In an attempt to reach Loki,&nbsp;
Sylvie prunes herself, and narrowly escapes Alioth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:05.520
with Mobius' help. One of the Loki variants attempts to&nbsp;
betray the other Lokis for President Loki, causing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:11.440
a fight to ensue, forcing Loki and his variant&nbsp;
allies to escape. After reuniting with Loki,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:16.240
Sylvie proposes a plan to approach Alioth and&nbsp;
enchant it, in hopes that it will lead them to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:22.800
the real mastermind behind the TVA's creation. As&nbsp;
the Lokis head toward Alioth, Mobius uses a TemPad&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:29.280
Sylvie stole from Renslayer to return to&nbsp;
the TVA. Kid Loki and Alligator Loki escape&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:34.640
while Classic Loki creates a large illusion&nbsp;
of Asgard to distract Alioth and sacrifices&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:39.520
himself in the process. This allows Loki and&nbsp;
Sylvie to successfully enchant the creature&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:44.880
and move past the Void. In the distance, we see a citadel, and the pair walks towards it.

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:50.000
Renslayer leaves on a mission to find "free&nbsp;
will" after Miss Minutes gives her information&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:56.720
from the TVA's creator, "He Who Remains". B-15&nbsp;
proves to TVA troopers that they are variants&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:02.160
by showing them a Renslayer variant who is a&nbsp;
school vice-principal. In the Citadel at the End&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:10.000
of Time, He Who Remains tells Loki and Sylvie that&nbsp;
he ended a multiversal war between his variants by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:16.240
using Alioth to destroy alternate timelines, and&nbsp;
created the TVA to maintain this peace. As he has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:22.640
grown weary, he offers them a choice: kill him&nbsp;
and risk another multiversal war, or replace him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:28.400
in overseeing the TVA and a singular timeline.&nbsp;
Sylvie wants to kill him but Loki pleads with her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:35.280
to stop. They kiss, but Sylvie sends Loki back&nbsp;
to TVA headquarters. She kills He Who Remains,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:41.360
unleashing a multiverse with alternate timelines&nbsp;
that the TVA cannot prune. At TVA headquarters,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:47.280
Loki warns Mobius and B-15 about variants&nbsp;
of He Who Remains, but they do not recognize&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:53.840
Loki and he sees that a statue of one of these&nbsp;
variants has replaced those of the Time-Keepers.
