00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:13.760
Hi guys, Korean Movie Recapped here. Before&nbsp;
we start, I have a small news to announce.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.400
I would like to introduce myself as&nbsp;
the new narrator for our future videos.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.640
I hope that you can enjoy my narration&nbsp;
as much as the previous video.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.760
Thank you, and enjoy the video!
Today, I’m going to recap a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:34.480
Korean movie released in 2019, called, Innocent&nbsp;
Witness. This story is about a girl with autism,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:40.320
who is also a key witness to a murder. Because of&nbsp;
her condition, she was unable to testify in court&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.440
properly and was easily denied by the defense&nbsp;
attorney. What will the defense attorney do?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:52.960
How do they find the truth? And what is the plot&nbsp;
behind all of this? Let’s find the truth together.&nbsp;

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:59.680
This young man is a lawyer, named Mr. Yang. He&nbsp;
lives with his father and is still unmarried.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.720
He is an outstanding lawyer with great&nbsp;
skills, who currently works in a law firm.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.240
Fascinated by his abilities, his boss then&nbsp;
compliments him, and later gives him a special&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.840
pro bono case. A murder case, where the maid is&nbsp;
the prime suspect because she was at the scene.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.040
His boss says that the prosecutor built the case&nbsp;
solely on the witness’ account, where the sole&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:27.440
witness is only a 15-year-old girl with autism.
On the other hand, at school, this little girl is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:34.400
Ji-Woo. She has autism, so her classmate often&nbsp;
bullied him. On that night, at his house, this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:40.080
girl looked out the window. She saw an old man&nbsp;
whose head was wrapped in plastic, and his maid,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.880
in a room across from her house. She then&nbsp;
screamed hysterically until her parents&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.640
came and calmed her down. She later became a key&nbsp;
witness in the murder case handled by Mr. Yang.&nbsp;

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:58.000
The next day, Mr. Yang meets the maid who&nbsp;
is the suspect. Her name is Mi-Ran. Before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.160
questioning her, he asks Mi-Ran to always&nbsp;
be honest with him in all conditions, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:08.960
she agrees. Then she tells the chronology of the&nbsp;
incident. That night, she heard a strange noise.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.000
When she went to check on his master, she&nbsp;
saw her master’s head was wrapped in plastic.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.440
She tried to help him, but her master kept holding&nbsp;
on to the plastic and instead pushed her away.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.880
She couldn’t restrain him. She then tried&nbsp;
to take something to tear the plastic.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.800
But when she returned to the&nbsp;
room, her master had already died.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.720
After telling the chronology, Mi-Ran cries and&nbsp;
blames herself for being slow to help her master.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.720
She then asks Mr. Yang to help her.
After that, he works on the case carefully.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:47.120
He watches the interrogation tape from the key&nbsp;
witness. Not satisfied, he then goes to meet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:53.360
the witness, Ji-Woon. But at her home, her mother&nbsp;
forbids Mr. Yang to see her daughter. Not giving&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.960
up, he then meets a child psychologist to ask&nbsp;
what she thinks about the interrogation video. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.520
psychologist said that she has high intelligence,&nbsp;
and the interrogation went very well because the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:08.160
prosecutor seemed to understand how to deal with&nbsp;
autistic people, but was not leading him either.&nbsp;

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.440
During the pre-trial, Mr. Yang as a defense&nbsp;
attorney asks the judge to bring the witness to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.480
court. But the prosecutor refuses and says&nbsp;
that the witness has special conditions,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.440
and it would be dangerous for the&nbsp;
witness' health to put her on the stand.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:26.480
But after deliberation, the judge decided&nbsp;
to allow the witness to appear in court.&nbsp;

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.840
According to the psychologist's advice, Mr. Yang&nbsp;
tries to enter the world of the little girl.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:39.280
He starts by meeting her at school. There, Ji-Woo&nbsp;
is with her best friend, Shin. After giving them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.840
business cards, he tries to ask Ji-Woo some&nbsp;
questions regarding what she saw that night.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:50.000
But she refuses to answer and ignores him.&nbsp;
In the end, Shin says that in order to talk&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.760
to Ji-Woo, he has to use something she&nbsp;
likes, which is puzzles and quizzes.&nbsp;

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.080
In court, Mr. Yang presents a&nbsp;
witness who is a forensic expert.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:02.880
There he presents evidence of his theory&nbsp;
that the victim actually commited suicide.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.320
This is also reinforced by evidence a few&nbsp;
days earlier the victim bought butane gas&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.640
at the supermarket. The evidence is then&nbsp;
received by the court and the court is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:18.480
adjourned to examine the sole witness, Ji-Woo.
This time, he tries again to get close to Ji-Woo.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:22.560
He bought some puzzles, but&nbsp;
apparently she isn’t interested.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:29.840
Not giving up, this time he invites them to&nbsp;
eat ramen. After that he takes her home. In&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.520
front of her house, there was already the&nbsp;
prosecutor who looked close to Ji-Woo.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:39.680
He again asks the mother to allow him to&nbsp;
interrogate Ji-Woo, but she refuses. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:46.480
it turned out that from the window Ji-Woo noticed&nbsp;
him. At night, she sends a puzzle to Mr. Yang. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:53.760
then answers it. And from this, they grow closer,&nbsp;
day by day. One day, he tries to find Ji-Woo.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:00.400
He sees her being forced to drink something&nbsp;
by her best friend, Shin. Because she refused,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:06.240
Shin then hit her. Seeing that, he stops Shin,&nbsp;
and then says such a person is not a good friend.&nbsp;

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.560
They become closer and finally the&nbsp;
mother allows Mr. Yang enters the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:15.760
house and interrogates her daughter. After&nbsp;
asking some questions, Ji-Woo said Shin,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:21.680
who’s always smiling at her, was taking advantage&nbsp;
of her. Was he also just taking advantage of her?&nbsp;

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:28.240
The scene continues to court. As Ji-Woo sits on&nbsp;
the witness stand, she keeps her ears covered.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:34.480
It turns out she is disturbed by the sound of the&nbsp;
clock ticking. They then turn off the wall clock.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:41.680
The trial continues. The prosecutor asks her to&nbsp;
tell what she saw. Ji-Woo explains what she saw,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.680
and believes his maid attacked the victim&nbsp;
because the maid smiled while holding the victim.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:51.760
Surprisingly, Mr. Yang as a defense attorney says&nbsp;
that Ji-Woo has an autism disorder that caused her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:57.360
to be unable to distinguish expressions, which&nbsp;
he later proves in the court. After humiliating&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:02.480
Ji-Woo, finally Mr. Yang wins the trial and&nbsp;
Mi-Ran is acquitted of not being proven guilty.&nbsp;

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:08.800
After the trial, he meets Mi-Ran and says that&nbsp;
the prosecutor is appealing. She says she is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:15.280
not afraid as long as Mr. Yang defends her.&nbsp;
She then says goodbye to meet her son. Here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:19.840
Mr. Yang feels something is odd because she&nbsp;
previously said that she didn’t have any family.&nbsp;

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:25.920
He then begins to doubt himself. He tries to&nbsp;
recall his memories of everything about the case.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.840
His conscience told him that what he&nbsp;
was doing was not the right thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:34.880
On the other hand, at school, Ji-Woo&nbsp;
can’t go home because of heavy rain.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:40.800
Shin then comes and apologizes for what&nbsp;
she has done to Ji-Woo. She then gives her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:45.920
umbrella and runs into the rain. Moments&nbsp;
later, Mi-Ran appears and taunts Ji-Woo.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:50.880
She said that she shouldn’t be involved in&nbsp;
adult business, and then pushed her away.&nbsp;

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:57.360
Mr. Yang deeply regrets himself. On the&nbsp;
other hand, the prosecutor is trying to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:02.800
prepare his appeal. He meets Ji-Woo’s mother to&nbsp;
ask her daughter to stand in court once again,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:08.000
but the mother refuses. Then Ji-Woo tells his&nbsp;
mother that she wants to be a witness again.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:13.360
Her mother forbids her, but then she says that she&nbsp;
cannot become a lawyer because she is autistic,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:18.160
but at least she can be a witness to let&nbsp;
people know the truth. To do what is right.&nbsp;

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:24.880
At home, Mr. Yang gets a letter from his father.&nbsp;
He remembered his motivation to become a lawyer.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:32.640
“I want to do good things”. That's what he said&nbsp;
to his father a long time ago. The next morning,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:38.080
the day of appeal, he greets his father and&nbsp;
smiles. He understands what he has to do.&nbsp;

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:41.360
In the court, the first day of appeal begins.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:47.520
This time, Ji-Woo stepped confidently&nbsp;
towards the court stand. First of all,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:52.400
Mr. Yang proves that Ji-Woo has high intelligence&nbsp;
and she can remember very well in a short time.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:57.840
She also has acute hearing, which makes her&nbsp;
able to hear very well even from a distance.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:03.800
His boss tells him to stop, but he ignores&nbsp;
him. He then asked if she could hear or read&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:10.160
Mi-Ran’s mouth movement the night the victim&nbsp;
was killed. She said she can. That night, the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:17.280
maid said “Yikes! That’s just pathetic. If only&nbsp;
you die, both my child and your child can live.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:23.120
Jost go quietly, will you? If you had the&nbsp;
money to give away, you should’ve given it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:28.480
to me”. Suddenly, the child of the victim who&nbsp;
came to court tries to leave, but is stopped.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:33.680
Judge then asks for Mr. Yang role and reminded&nbsp;
him of the code of ethics he would face.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:38.320
He said a lawyer is a human too, who&nbsp;
has a desire to do what is right.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:42.000
His boss then gets angry&nbsp;
and goes mad at the trial.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:49.200
He blasphemes Mr. Yang, and is later removed from&nbsp;
the trial by the judge. In the end, the trial is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:53.840
won by the prosecutor, but Mr. Yang gets what&nbsp;
he wants, the truth, and to do what is right.&nbsp;

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:59.280
At the end of the movie, Mr. Yang is getting&nbsp;
closer and good friends with Ji-Woon.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:05.520
He also dares to express his feelings&nbsp;
to the woman he likes. What is around us&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:10.400
is not always good. But what makes us good&nbsp;
is whether we dare to do the right things.

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:13.600
Do you dare to do something&nbsp;
right in your life too?&nbsp;&nbsp;
