00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.699
Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:06.200
Today, I'm going to explain a sci-fi horror
film called “Mimic.”

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.660
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:09.300
Watch out and take care.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.750
In Manhattan, cockroaches are spreading a
deadly disease, and a large number of children

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:14.930
die.

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:20.000
Desperate to stop the epidemic, Doctor Peter
Mann, head of the CDC in New York, calls on

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.850
the aid of entomologist Susan Tyler.

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:27.439
Susan uses genetic engineering to create an
insect hybrid called the Judas bug.

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:31.880
The Judas is a hybrid between a termite and
a mantis and is designed to release an enzyme

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.690
that accelerates the cockroaches’ metabolism,
causing roaches to starve to death.

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.269
Susan designs the Judas to have short lifespans,
making sure they all die in a few months so

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:43.530
that they won’t disrupt the ecosystem.

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.350
Peter and Susan release Judas bugs, and the
cockroaches die off.

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.199
In a short time, the disease is eradicated,
children are saved, and Peter and Susan are

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.530
married.

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.999
Three years pass, and a priest is seen running
from an unseen attacker.

00:00:56.999 --> 00:01:01.779
He’s trapped on a roof, but whatever is
chasing him tries to break open the door.

00:01:01.779 --> 00:01:04.680
The priest decides to scale down the side
of the building.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.990
The unseen attacker catches up to the priest,
and the priest falls down screaming.

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:10.600
He dies upon impact.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.820
A young boy from an adjacent building, Chuy,
sees the priest being dragged into the sewers

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.590
but thinks nothing of it.

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.850
Peter and Susan are preparing for an insect
exhibit, and Peter expresses his excitement

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.460
for starting a family, handing Susan an herbal
tonic that could help with conception.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.390
Peter then arrives at an investigation scene
where police have found illegal immigrants

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.170
and are holding them in a building.

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.280
Peter’s colleague, Josh, tells Peter that
the inhabitants have Yellow Fever.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.820
The building is also a front for illegal activities,
being run by the priest who earlier fell to

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:42.909
his death.

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:46.759
Peter then orders the quarantine of everyone
in the building as well as the first responders

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:48.069
to the scene.

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:51.859
They also find fecal matter on the ceiling
and a hysterical woman raving about a dark

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:53.950
angel coming to kill her.

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.030
Susan arrives at her insect laboratory with
a friend, and they’re met by two teenagers

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:59.969
eager to sell her insects.

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.609
One of the kids asks her why she likes insects
so much, and Susan tells him she admires insects

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:07.179
for their ingenuity and intelligence.

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:11.549
Insects have been around even before the dinosaurs
and are still alive today, making them a highly

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:14.110
successful inhabitant of the planet.

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.510
Susan explains the importance of each member
of an insect colony, from the drone or soldier

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.180
bugs to the queen.

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.150
Susan expounds that the drone bugs maintain
security and gather food.

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.489
They also guard an essential part of the colony;
the nest.

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:31.640
If the nest is invaded or destroyed, it could
mean the death of the entire colony.

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.819
All male members of a colony are sterile except
for one, and it’s this single male is the

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.120
only one that can mate with the queen.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.510
If it dies, the birth process might get interrupted,
and the entire colony could die off.

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.680
Wanting to get more money, the kids offer
Susan a weird bug they found in the subway,

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.239
and after some negotiation, Susan gets the
bizarre insect.

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.750
Susan later notices that the weird bug’s
container is moving.

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.379
She tries to open it carefully, but it bites
her.

00:02:57.379 --> 00:03:00.900
She‘s immediately alarmed and tells her
friend they have to find the kids who sold

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.019
it to her.

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:06.170
She gets her equipment and slices the container
open, discovering that the weird bug is a

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.660
Judas bug from three years ago.

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.230
She tries to examine it, but it bites her.

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.810
She then stabs it with a pin, killing it.

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.890
Seeing the weird bug secrete a white ooze,
she’s sure that it’s a Judas bug.

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.010
She reviews her old research notes but cannot
seem to find an explanation.

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.079
As she looks through her files, she doesn’t
notice a figure approaching her window.

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:29.489
The shadowy phantom enters and makes its way
to the Judas bug.

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:34.150
Susan takes a confirmatory enzyme test, and
the result comes back similar to the Judas

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.800
bug’s enzyme test from three years ago.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.209
The dark figure makes a sound, and Susan goes
to check.

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:44.840
She sees that the Judas bug has been taken,
and her lab equipment has spilled to the floor.

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.230
She looks through the mess but finds nothing.

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.220
She notices a shadow moving in the darkness
but could not make out what it is.

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.390
Suddenly, the figure flies past her, out through
the window.

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.170
That night, Chuy sees a strange shape moving
in the street towards the building where the

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.170
illegal immigrants were discovered.

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.959
His caretaker, Manny, checks on what Chuy
is looking at but sees nothing.

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:10.150
Susan informs Peter that the specimen she
got from the two kids is undoubtedly the Judas

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:11.150
bug.

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.980
Peter is surprised, knowing that the Judas
bugs were engineered only to live one generation.

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:20.530
Susan is baffled as to how this has happened
but knows that they have to get more information.

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:25.320
Not only was the specimen confirmed to be
a Judas bug, but it was also just a hatchling.

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.000
The Judas bug was designed to die, but it’s
been breeding.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.230
The following day, Peter and Susan meet up
with the kids at a subway station and access

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:34.980
an old maintenance room.

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:38.400
Manny is also at the same station with Chuy
polishing shoes.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.030
Susan asks the kids if they’d seen some
kind of egg sack for the bugs, but the kids

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:43.410
say they didn’t.

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:47.130
Susan and Peter enter the old room but see
nothing out of the ordinary.

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:51.000
Susan drops some beads, and they fall down
a hidden hole behind a metal cabinet.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.110
Peter’s flashlight falls in, and they try
to reach in.

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:58.690
Susan gets her arm in but doesn’t see a
creature on the other side examining her arm.

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:02.400
Just before it bites, a policeman, Leonard,
enters.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.170
Susan gets her arm out, and Peter and Leonard
get into an argument.

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:08.790
Leonard wants them out and tells them they
can’t continue without a permit.

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:10.760
Peter gets mad but agrees they’ll return
some other time.

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.870
Meanwhile, Susan meets Chuy and Manny.

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:17.260
She discovers that Chuy is a talented savant,
able to tell the shoe size and brand of any

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.570
shoes just by the footsteps.

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:23.970
The two kids later head into a different part
of the train yard looking for the egg sack.

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:27.700
They find a slimy sack, looking like the egg
sack Susan showed them.

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:30.900
They try to pry it open but a creature comes
up behind them.

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:35.380
One of the kids shines a flashlight and sees
that the creature looks like a giant insect.

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:39.620
The other kid falls, and the one with the
flashlight gets stabbed through the chest.

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:42.070
The creature then attacks the other kid.

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:47.450
The following day, Susan meets with her colleague
and mentor, Doctor Gates, and informs him

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:49.260
about what she’s discovered.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.850
Gates theorizes that some of the Judas bugs
may have survived.

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:56.510
Susan affirms that the Judas bugs all died
during experiments.

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:59.380
Gates nods, but the world is a different place.

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:02.160
He speculates some of them may have found
a way.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:06.550
Even a tiny portion of the bugs could have
lived and developed into a whole colony.

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:10.560
Back in Manny’s apartment, Chuy is awake
staring at the quarantined building.

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:14.250
He hears strange sounds coming from inside
and goes in to investigate.

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:18.000
He finds a chapel with everything covered
up, and the sounds get louder.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.740
He then sees a figure approaching that looks
like a person in an overcoat.

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:25.180
Another creature comes up behind him, and
they come closer.

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:29.470
At a water treatment plant, workers fish out
some sort of creature from the filtering tanks

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:31.900
and initially suspect it to be a toddler.

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:36.010
Upon closer inspection, they realize they’d
need an expert on insects.

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:39.950
The following day, Susan gets a call to get
to the water treatment plant.

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:43.360
She arrives shortly with her friend, and they
examine a specimen.

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:47.210
A worker takes it out of the freezer and shows
it to Susan and her friend.

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:50.940
The worker tells them that they find all sorts
of things in the filtering tanks, but this

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:52.220
looks different.

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:56.900
He reveals it, and Susan sees that it’s
a Judas bug but almost as big as a dog.

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:00.610
Her friend takes pictures, and Susan tells
her to have them delivered to Doctor Gates

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:02.440
for a detailed analysis.

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:05.700
Meanwhile, Manny discovers that Chuy is missing.

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:09.420
He sees Chuy’s window open and speculates
that he may have gone into the building next

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:10.690
to them.

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:15.150
Peter, Josh, and Leonard arrive back at the
train station and see a gaping hole in the

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:16.150
wall.

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:20.140
They go in carrying lab equipment, hoping
to get a sample or maybe find the Judas’

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:21.140
nest.

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:24.080
Leonard tells them that the sections head
to the lower levels, and some of the levels

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:25.630
are undermaintained.

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:28.190
They go down several stories underground.

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:32.320
Meanwhile, Manny calls the police but gets
his report waitlisted.

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:36.770
He then tries to find a way into the building
but instead finds an entrance into the sewer.

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:39.350
Manny heads down with nothing but a lighter.

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:42.150
Peter gets a call from Susan but gets reception.

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:45.920
They then agree to meet at the train station
as Susan needs to tell Peter what she found

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:48.000
at the water treatment plant.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.370
Gates examines the creature found at the plant
with Susan’s friend.

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:55.230
Gates discovers that the specimen isn’t
just a one-off mutation but is actually a

00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:57.330
member of a complex colony.

00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:01.110
Susan then arrives at the train station but
waits for Peter by the entrance.

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:05.910
Leonard, Josh, and Peter head deeper in and
find a room with feces all over the walls

00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:08.060
and hanging from the ceiling.

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:11.820
Susan then examines the photographs they took
of the creature from the water treatment plant

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:13.970
and focuses on two pictures.

00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:17.580
She takes two parts and holds them next to
each other, the bug’s appendages forming

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:19.850
what looks like a human skull.

00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:22.860
She soon realizes that she’s alone at the
station.

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:26.840
She tries to walk to the entrance to the underground
but sees a shadow of a person standing at

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:28.590
the edge of the platform.

00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:31.280
She tries calling out but gets no response.

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:35.700
She then decides to walk away, but the figure
reveals itself as a giant Judas bug the size

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:37.060
of a person.

00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:41.080
Susan sees it and starts running, but the
Judas bug takes her and flies off into the

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:42.169
tunnel.

00:08:42.169 --> 00:08:47.200
Peter and Josh gather specimens from the walls
while Leonard stands on an old wooden platform,

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:49.180
looking at the remnants of the old subway.

00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:52.490
A minor Judas bug comes up to him, and he
squishes it.

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:55.730
Peter sees this and rushes to save it but
is too late.

00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:58.959
Both men are now standing on the platform
when it gives way.

00:08:58.959 --> 00:09:02.480
They both fall to the ground, and Josh is
left alone above.

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:04.990
Leonard tasks Josh to go back and get help.

00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:09.579
Josh hesitates, saying he won’t find a way
back, but realizes he has no choice but to

00:09:09.579 --> 00:09:13.240
go as there’s no means of Leonard or Peter
getting back up.

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:16.420
Susan wakes up finding herself deep inside
the sewers.

00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:21.920
She sees several bodies, including the priest’s
body, and grabs a metal pipe to defend herself.

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:26.660
She explores around, trying to find a way
out but sees more tunnels in all directions.

00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:28.750
She sees light and approaches it.

00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:31.580
Looking up, she sees people walking above
ground.

00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:35.500
She tries to scream for help, but instead
of attracting people’s attention, she gets

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:37.750
the attention of one of the Judas bugs.

00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:42.249
A bigger Judas bug comes to attack her, but
she impales it with the pipe and runs.

00:09:42.249 --> 00:09:46.870
Another bug comes chasing after her, but she
escapes through a maintenance hole opening.

00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:51.040
Josh tries to find his way back but gets sidetracked
and sees a metal door.

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:54.279
He opens it up, revealing several Judas egg
sacks.

00:09:54.279 --> 00:09:57.819
He sees one of the Judas bugs inside, but
he sneaks away.

00:09:57.819 --> 00:10:01.600
He slowly and silently tries to make it out
and sees an opening above.

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:05.889
He tries to get up, but the platform but falls,
making a loud thud.

00:10:05.889 --> 00:10:07.759
This awakens the Judas bug.

00:10:07.759 --> 00:10:12.079
Josh hurries back up, reaching for a rope,
but the Judas bug catches him.

00:10:12.079 --> 00:10:16.449
Josh desperately reaches for the rope, but
blood sprays all over him from below, and

00:10:16.449 --> 00:10:18.410
he starts bleeding from the mouth.

00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:20.730
Josh then falls back down.

00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:24.550
Susan looks up at the metal maintenance hole
cover above her, hearing movement.

00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:27.290
She’s surprised to see Manny appear.

00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:31.379
Peter and Leonard explore around the chasm,
believing Josh would be returning soon with

00:10:31.379 --> 00:10:32.379
help.

00:10:32.379 --> 00:10:37.200
Leonard sees an old train car, telling Peter
details about it, but Peter is uninterested.

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:39.949
They soon hear footsteps from around the corner.

00:10:39.949 --> 00:10:42.720
Manny appears, telling them about Susan.

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:47.060
They help Susan get back up, but a Judas bug
hears them and starts coming for Susan.

00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:50.000
They reach down for Susan and drop one of
the lights.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.670
As the light falls, they see a Judas bug flying
up for Susan.

00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:56.899
They pull Susan up, close the lid, and start
running.

00:10:56.899 --> 00:11:00.750
They head back to the large chasm and try
to find cover in the train car.

00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:04.360
Leonard fires several rounds at the Judas
bug, but it keeps coming.

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:07.499
The bug gets stuck at the door, and Leonard
keeps firing.

00:11:07.499 --> 00:11:11.240
The bug tries to pull itself up but ends up
tearing itself apart.

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:14.860
It crawls under one of the shelves, and Peter
helps Leonard trying to get it out so they

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:15.990
can kill it.

00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:19.250
They drag the Judas bug out, and Leonard drops
his guard.

00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:22.860
The bug then springs back to life, slashing
Leonard’s leg.

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:26.310
Leonard fires more bullets at the bug, finally
killing it.

00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:30.629
They lock themselves inside the train car,
and Peter tends to Leonard’s wounds.

00:11:30.629 --> 00:11:35.499
Manny helps Susan examine the dead bug, and
she sees that the insect has developed organs,

00:11:35.499 --> 00:11:37.439
specifically, lungs.

00:11:37.439 --> 00:11:41.500
Susan speculates that when she accelerated
the Judas’ metabolism, she inadvertently

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:44.170
accelerated their breeding cycle as well.

00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:48.790
In three years, the Judas could have reproduced
over several hundred thousand generations,

00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:51.110
making them have accelerated evolution.

00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:55.240
Peter is in disbelief, but Susan maintains
that apes turned into humans in just forty

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:57.059
thousand generations.

00:11:57.059 --> 00:12:00.529
With the Judas going through several hundred
thousand, there’s no telling what they could

00:12:00.529 --> 00:12:02.320
have evolved into.

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:06.509
Susan explains that animals in the wild sometimes
evolve to mimic their predator.

00:12:06.509 --> 00:12:10.910
The reason why Judas bugs have stayed hidden
for so long may be a result of this.

00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:14.570
Susan surmises that the Judas could have evolved
to mimic humans.

00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:17.720
A swarm of Judas bugs then charge the train
car.

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:20.959
Susan sees that blood from Leonard’s wound
is attracting them.

00:12:20.959 --> 00:12:24.920
She then takes the dead bug’s scent glands
and rubs them all over the cabin.

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:28.450
She tells everyone to rub it against the cracks
to repel the bugs.

00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:29.540
This could mask the scent of Leonard’s blood.

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:30.839
Peter takes a scent gland and rubs it all
over Leonard’s wounds.

00:12:30.839 --> 00:12:33.970
The Judas bugs soon stop and leave them alone.

00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:38.519
Leonard finds an old map of the train station
and sees that they may have a chance to escape.

00:12:38.519 --> 00:12:42.249
They need to switch the tracks and rewire
a fusebox to get the train going and get it

00:12:42.249 --> 00:12:43.760
to the nearest exit.

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:47.339
Peter then decides it should be him and Manny
who should go out.

00:12:47.339 --> 00:12:51.269
Manny and Peter rub the scent glands all over
themselves and split up.

00:12:51.269 --> 00:12:54.759
Manny heads of the track switch while Peter
goes to the fuse box.

00:12:54.759 --> 00:12:59.320
Peter quietly makes his way down the tracks
but comes face to face with a Judas bug.

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:02.860
He tries to stay still, and the Judas bug
walks over him.

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:05.720
He rubs more of the scent gland on himself.

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:09.389
Susan speculates that the Judases that have
been attacking them must be female as the

00:13:09.389 --> 00:13:13.040
males are smaller, have a lighter color, and
can’t fly.

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:16.720
If they find and kill the single fertile male
in the colony, they could potentially wipe

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:18.300
them all out.

00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:21.700
Manny searches for the track switch but instead
finds Chuy.

00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:25.819
Manny tries to get Chuy to come with him,
but a Judas bug comes up behind him and stabs

00:13:25.819 --> 00:13:26.939
him through the chest.

00:13:26.939 --> 00:13:29.689
Chuy screams, watching Manny die.

00:13:29.689 --> 00:13:32.940
Peter gets the fuse box running, and the lights
turn on.

00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:36.290
Leonard turns the train’s power on, and
it starts moving.

00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:40.000
Susan finds Chuy and the track switch, and
she takes Chuy with her.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.999
Peter also finds a small dumbwaiter that could
also be a way to the surface.

00:13:43.999 --> 00:13:48.680
Leonard gets the train moving forward, but
it runs into a problem and starts smoking.

00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:52.949
Peter reunites with Susan and Chuy, and they
try to hide from the Judas bugs.

00:13:52.949 --> 00:13:56.949
Leonard sees Judases swarming the group and
decides to step out of the train.

00:13:56.949 --> 00:14:00.879
He tries to get the Judases’ attention by
singing and letting himself bleed.

00:14:00.879 --> 00:14:03.410
The Judases then charge Leonard.

00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:07.540
With the coast clear, Peter, Chuy, and Susan
head to the dumbwaiter.

00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:11.490
Susan and Chuy get in, but Peter gets separated
when more bugs appear.

00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:14.300
He tries pulling them up, but the bugs charge
him.

00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:17.769
Peter crawls through a small tunnel and finds
himself in the nest.

00:14:17.769 --> 00:14:21.100
He has the chance to destroy these creatures
once and for all.

00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:25.240
A bug sees Susan and Chuy had made it up the
dumbwaiter and surprisingly understands how

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:26.460
it works.

00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:30.100
It starts trying to cut the cable holding
up the dumbwaiter, but Susan and Chuy make

00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:31.800
it out just in time.

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:35.160
The dumbwaiter falls, trapping the bugs underground.

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:40.360
Peter sees gas pipes running all over the
nest and takes an ax, smashing the pipes open.

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:42.939
Flammable gas leaks out, filling the room.

00:14:42.939 --> 00:14:46.680
The bugs chasing after him break the steel
plate open and almost get through to him,

00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:49.699
but Peter takes a lighter and tries to ignite
the gas.

00:14:49.699 --> 00:14:52.829
The lighter malfunctions and falls into the
water below.

00:14:52.829 --> 00:14:56.790
Peter takes the ax, bashing it against steel
to produce a spark that he hopes would ignite

00:14:56.790 --> 00:14:58.069
the gas.

00:14:58.069 --> 00:15:02.920
Just as the Judas bugs descend on him, Peter
creates a spark, and the entire sewer system

00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:03.920
explodes.

00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:08.339
On the surface, utility hole covers are launched
into the air, cars are ignited, the ground

00:15:08.339 --> 00:15:11.079
rumbles, and fire bursts out from the sewers.

00:15:11.079 --> 00:15:15.209
Susan gains consciousness and sees Chuy, but
the fertile male Judas bug appears.

00:15:15.209 --> 00:15:18.970
Chuy is frozen in fear as the Judas bug approaches
him.

00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:23.660
Susan wounds herself to attract the bug’s
attention and runs towards an oncoming train.

00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:28.019
The Judas bug runs after her, and right before
the train runs them over, she jumps out of

00:15:28.019 --> 00:15:29.019
the way.

00:15:29.019 --> 00:15:33.079
The Judas bug gets squished and dismantled
under the train’s wheels, and Susan finds

00:15:33.079 --> 00:15:34.079
Chuy.

00:15:34.079 --> 00:15:38.829
Firefighters, police, and medical personnel
swarm the streets as they try to get everything

00:15:38.829 --> 00:15:40.240
under control.

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:43.309
Gates tells Susan that all the bugs have been
exterminated.

00:15:43.309 --> 00:15:45.929
From the subway exit, Peter ascends.

00:15:45.929 --> 00:15:54.679
Susan and Chuy rush to him, and the three
all hug intimately.
