00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.670
Welcome back for another 5 minute movie recap.

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:07.530
Today, I'm going to give you an overview of
the 2017 Australian post-apocalyptic horror

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:09.800
drama film called 'Cargo'.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.940
There will be Spoilers ahead, so please proceed
with caution.

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:17.369
Andy Rose, his wife Kay, and their baby Rosie
are floating down a river on a houseboat in

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:23.220
rural Australia in a world recently overrun
by a virus that turns people rabid in 48 hours.

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.029
Kay recommends coming ashore and foraging
for food in the closest town due to a lack

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.119
of government supplies, but Andy disagrees,
claiming that it would be better to stay on

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:34.590
the river until they reach their objective,
a fabled haven.

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.830
Andy explores an abandoned sailboat alone
the next day and recovers some supplies, but

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:42.840
he hurriedly departs when it becomes clear
that there is someone else on board.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.710
Andy shows Kay his collection but fails to
warn her about the risk, and she gets bitten

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.820
by a rabid human when she goes out to gather
more.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.090
When Andy discovers Kay bandaging the bite
wound, he urges that she be sent to the hospital

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.540
since she will bleed out long before succumbing
to the infection.

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.800
The Rose family disembarks, jumpstarts an
abandoned automobile, and drives toward a

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.899
major town, but they swerve to miss an Aboriginal
man standing in the road and crash.

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:11.170
Andy faints after Kay is impaled; when he
wakes up, Kay has already transformed and

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:12.619
is biting him.

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:17.049
Andy takes Rosie out of the car and begins
to fight the man, who has also transformed,

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:21.710
but a girl called Thoomi enters and explains
that the man is Willie Bell, Andy's father.

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.829
Because the Aboriginals have been murdering
and burning the sick, Thoomi has been concealing

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:29.460
Willie from her mother, Josie, and the rest
of her society.

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.649
She believes her father can be saved by having
a shaman restore his soul.

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:37.890
Andy arrives in town, but it is more smaller
and desolate than he had anticipated, save

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.679
for Etta, a schoolteacher who will look after
him and Rosie for the night.

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:46.029
Etta says that all of her pupils and their
families, the majority of whom are Aboriginals,

00:01:46.029 --> 00:01:50.250
have abandoned contemporary trappings in favour
of the traditional traditions, and advises

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.729
Andy to conceal his bite mark.

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:56.450
After his first seizure from the illness,
Andy wakes up later than expected the next

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:57.579
morning.

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:01.420
When Andy and Rosie leave, Etta shows them
a photograph of Thoomi and her parents and

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.740
instructs Andy to locate them and leave Rosie
with them.

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.570
Vic brings Andy to his refuge and meets Lorraine,
whom Andy believes is Vic's wife, after Andy

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.250
frees a man called Vic who is stuck beneath
some gas cylinders.

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.960
Vic puts healthy individuals in cages as bait,
one of whom is Thoomi, to entice the infected

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.860
out so he may shoot them, Andy discovers.

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.210
Andy tries suicide that night, assuming Vic
and Lorraine will look after Rosie, but Lorraine

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:29.340
intervenes and confesses that she is not Vic's
wife, but his hostage, and Vic murdered her

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.020
actual husband.

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.050
Vic finds them and knocks Andy unconscious,
putting him in the same cell as Thoomi.

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.480
They assist each other escape by pulling open
their cage with the combined might of numerous

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.220
infected; they return to the refuge and meet
Lorraine and Rosie.

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.710
Vic fires at them as they flee, killing Lorraine
accidentally.

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:50.300
Andy irritates Thoomi the next morning when
he informs her that he and her father would

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:51.800
not get along.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.500
She dashes to the location where she had been
hiding her father, only to learn that her

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.720
people had already located and imprisoned
Willie.

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.250
Thoomi is distraught at first, blaming Andy
for the delay, but when she hears Rosie weeping,

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:04.910
she relents and rejoins him.

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:09.720
They proceed by motorboat to a campground
where Andy had previously seen another family,

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.190
only to discover that the father has been
bitten and intends to kill his family and

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.150
himself with a pistol.

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.080
Andy is instructed by his father to use the
gun's final two rounds on himself and Rosie.

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.250
When the family is dead, Andy picks up the
gun and considers committing himself, but

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:25.710
Thoomi intervenes.

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:29.630
They then become aware of smoke in the area
and proceed to investigate.

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.870
Vic resurfaces as the trio passes through
a railway tunnel.

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.850
While Andy and Vic fight, Thoomi hides with
Rosie inside a parked truck on the tracks.

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:41.710
Vic gets to take the handgun and shoot Andy
during the scuffle, then goes for Thoomi and

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:42.900
Rosie.

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.830
When Andy awakens, he discovers Vic cuddling
Rosie and sobbing over Lorraine's death.

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:52.240
Vic gives Rosie to Andy in a calm manner,
allowing them and Thoomi to go.

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.860
Andy later succumbs to the infection's last
stages.

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:59.030
Andy urges Thoomi to watch after Rosie as
his time runs out.

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.020
He and Thoomi bind his hands and prepare a
piece of flesh on a pole for Thoomi to use

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:05.560
as bait after he has transformed.

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.690
Thoomi uses Andy to safely carry her and Rosie
on his back in this manner.

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.741
They finally track down an Aboriginal warrior
group, which includes Thoomi's mother, who

00:04:13.741 --> 00:04:16.100
recognises Thoomi's whistle.

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.850
Thoomi enables a warrior to put Andy out of
his suffering now that she is reunited with

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:21.950
her people and Rosie is safe.

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:26.230
The group subsequently returns to a remote
forest camp, where Thoomi and Josie examine

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:30.660
Rosie for injuries and discover Andy has painted
'Thank You' on her tummy.
