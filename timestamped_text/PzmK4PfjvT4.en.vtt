00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.880
Years ago, back when the main protagonist,
Charlotte, was around 13-14 years old

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.119
she had joined the Bachoff Academy
where she practiced and learned the cello.

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:20.950
However, during her time there, she was drilled
hard in her practice, she was verbally abused

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:26.499
repeatedly for any mistakes and brainwashed
into being the ‘perfect’ cellist, and

00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:34.210
what more was sexually abused, again and again
by her teachers especially by Anton, her mentor.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:39.620
However she manages to escape, having to tend
to her sick mother who after ten years, dies

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.489
and Charlotte suffers a nervous breakdown
before getting hospitalized after which she

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.420
finds it within herself to take revenge against
Bachoff Academy and more importantly try

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.739
to open the eyes of Elizabeth, a fellow student
of Bachoff who she has matching tattoos with,

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.559
to make her realize that she’s only special
so long as she’s useful to Anton.

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.520
Charlotte heads to Shanghai to link up with
Elizabeth and creates a clever plan that involves

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:12.340
dosing her with the drugs her mother took
which can cause hallucinations if alcohol

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.280
is taken with the drugs.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.200
Stealing a meat cleaver from a restaurant
before planting suggestions and gaslighting

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.380
Elizabeth, she gives Liz the cleaver so
that she can cut off her hand.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.360
After which, Charlotte reveals that she was
also raped by Anton and that she made Liz

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:30.049
chop of her hand to make her useless to Him.

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:34.159
To ensure that Liz can never be
abused by him ever again.

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:39.039
Which is proven when Liz goes back to Boston,
3 weeks later and is kicked out from Bachoff

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:44.549
Academy and although furious, she has finally
accepted that she was abused and manipulated

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:50.270
by Anton and works together with Charlotte
to take Bachoff down: taking Charlotte back

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.149
to Bachoff Academy where she is forced to
play the “Perfection”, a ritual that involves

00:01:55.149 --> 00:02:00.140
the perfect performance of a difficult solo
piece that every single special student of

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:07.140
Bachoff must play in order to be ‘the best’,
or as Anton puts it ‘to be close to God’.

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:13.450
A ritual first started by Anton’s grand
father so many years ago, and the punishment

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:19.520
for not being the best is to be raped by each
teacher of Bachoff Academy.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.880
Meaning that Anton and all of the other teachers
were abused previously having gone through

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.980
the EXACT, SAME RITUAL

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:32.540
Ultimately, with a few poisoned glasses of
alcohol, and a knife to the back, Liz and

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.710
Charlotte kill the teachers one by one until
they finally get to Anton who after a brutal

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:43.180
and bloody fight has his arms and legs amputated
and is forced to listen to a performance of

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:49.300
Liz and Charlotte’s own version of the Perfection,
working together to play in front of their abuser

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.940
Now, something that I noticed throughout the
film is the presence of circles or circular

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.820
shapes and objects within shots.

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:00.970
Some of the more striking and eye catching
examples I found were the Peking Opera actor

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:06.760
in the Shanghai Opera House who forms a circular
shape with her hands, as well as the horns of the bus

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:12.440
that Liz and Charlotte ride on, and the Bachoff
Academy’s chapel which has a very conspicuous

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:17.880
architectural feature of a ring that is later
revealed to be able to open up, serving as

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.570
a backlight for all performers of the Perfection.

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:25.351
Now the circles themselves represent a great deal
of things in my opinion: for one they are

00:03:25.351 --> 00:03:29.910
an allusion to the Perfection, the namesake
of the film, in which a performer is abused

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:35.170
in a cult like practice and is said to be
as perfect as God once they perform it correctly,

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:40.330
it’s also a symmetrical shape that retains
an even, and perfect form that is not broken

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.480
by corners and of course it’s a circle.

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:50.320
A continuous wheel, representing the endless
cycle of abuse that Bachoff Academy condones

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.860
which is finally broken by broken people.

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:58.270
Early in the film, Liz chops off her right
hand, and in the fight with Anton, Charlotte

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:04.610
herself gets stabbed in the left arm, making them
both symmetrical and opposite pieces who complete

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:05.610
each other.

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.990
Which is why at the end of film they wear
black and white with Charlotte drawing the

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:13.500
bow with her right hand and Liz modulating
the pitch with her left.

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.630
Allowing them to achieve perfection in their
completeness and it is also why the letter

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:22.130
“E” in the title card rotates to face
the F in both the beginning and the end of

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:29.330
the film: Because the E completes the F making
them symmetrical and in turn making them perfect.

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.949
With that being said, thank you so much for
watching ladies and gentlemen.
