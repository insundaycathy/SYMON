00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:05.670
Welcome to Cinema Summary, ladies and
gentlemen grab your holy water, your

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.849
pistol and whatever other monster
slaying goodness you've got because

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.800
we're going monster hunting with the
Allen family. Based off of the comic

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.590
series of the same name, the October
Faction TV show takes a lot of

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.430
liberties with the source material to add
in elements that were not present in

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.210
the original comic book which I will be
referencing some times throughout this

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.237
video and word of warning
spoilers ahead and with that said

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.640
this is October Faction Season 1 explained

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.530
so the October Faction is all about the Allen

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.579
family returning to Barrington, New York
after Samuel Allen, the patriarch of the

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.890
family dies under mysterious
circumstances: Fred, Dolores, Vivian, and

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.840
Geoff Allen move into the estate into a
quiet little town that Vivian and Jeff just

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.370
don't fit into which isn't helped by the
fact that Vivian is a socially awkward

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.710
and solitary artist and Jeff is a
fun-loving homosexual who's 'kind' isn't

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.670
too welcome in Barrington but we quite
quickly learned that things are not as

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.799
they seem as Vivian has a vision of some
very strange and bizarre events though

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.520
after Vivian tries to do a seance to try
and connect to the spirit of her dead

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.200
grandpa she instead connects to a woman
who she sees chained beneath the water in

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.860
a vision and accidentally frees her

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.500
as I'll cover further on the kids have these

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.460
special powers of theirs that they're
learning to understand Vivian in

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.840
particular is a clairvoyant: able to draw
the future whereas Geoff is able to gain

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.180
information in form of telepathy or
psychometry. These power themselves bear

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.750
resemblance to the original powers of
the children in the comic books, Vivian

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.649
was able to see the fates of those she
sees around her and gain post cognitive

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.360
information although with a bit more
pyrokinesis and Jeff is able to see

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.899
ghosts much like in the series and gain
information about people through similar

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.860
powers and is able to electrocute people
which the comic book version of Geoff can

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.700
do albeit with magical blasts of energy
and having a few more powers in his

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.780
arsenal like teleportation, interdimensional 
travel,  and the binding of spirits

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.580
Now the source of their powers is never

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.730
elaborated on in the comic books
although it is explained at least for

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.900
Geoff as being a magical skill and
perhaps due to their heritage whereas

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.190
the TV show it's pretty explicitly
explained as an innate ability that Geoff

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:29.430
and Vivian have due to their biological
heritage as they are adopted being the

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.379
biological children of Alice Harlow
both in the comics and in the TV show. Mind

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:38.069
you this plot twist of them being adopted
is kind of predictable once you learned

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:42.420
that Deloris herself was not able to
bear children due to injuries sustained

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.349
now something that's very similar to the
comic books is that the children react

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:49.680
pretty badly after finding out that
their adopted I'll be it under different

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.000
circumstances with both materials but
something that was different was that in

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.110
the show the kids don't know at first
that they have powers whereas in the

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.799
comics they know from the start and are
eager to become Monster Hunters much

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:07.580
like their parents. Now the Allan estate has 
its own share of secrets: strange claw marks on

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:13.000
a wall, Fred's dead brother and photos around the house,
the cache of high-tech, high-powered weaponry and

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.960
and who could forget the juiciest secret of all

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:17.940
belonging to Fred and Dolores: the boring parents

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.019
Jeff and Vivian being actual professional 
monster hunters working for

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:26.250
a global monster hunting organization
known as Presidio which is run by this

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:31.620
woman named Edith now really quickly the
original source material does have the

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.060
parents being monster hunters albeit
retirees who go back into the business

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:41.069
after basically being thrusted back into
the world of monster hunting from then

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:44.760
on we have this mix-up of family drama,
high school sucking a lot, monster

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:50.069
hunting, and a conspiracy. You see after
Fred and Vivian kill a vampire at a

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:54.540
Barrington supermarket the mysterious
murder becomes a crime of interest to

00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:00.600
the local sheriff Gina--an old friend Delores at the same
time the mysterious woman from Vivian's vision

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.160
who says she hails from Harlow or something

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.440
uses her magic powers to break
into a Presidio safehouse to track and

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:12.750
hunt down the Allen's! Now weirdness is
normal for Fred and Deloris but Vivian

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.440
and Geoff are taken aback by their
experiences with the unnatural: Geoff

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.680
having some form of post cognition and
able to divine information about the

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.090
past which he uses to humiliate
his teacher and Vivian as we saw earlier

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.780
has visions of something and who
ultimately prophetically draws an

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.889
incident that happens earlier in the day
wherein a red truck stalled in the road

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:36.599
stopping a school bus which led to the
Harlow the witch finding them and inspecting

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:40.139
them where she then realizes that
Vivian is the one who called and

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:44.310
released her though by the second
episode we learn that Samuel Allen

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:49.889
isn't dead and is in fact alive and
being interrogated by Presidio for some

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:53.849
reason that I will elaborate on a bit
later then by the third and fourth

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:57.389
episode we get introduced to Jeff's
ghost seeing and talking ability, we

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:01.349
learn that someone or something has
been killing the local vampire bikers as

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:05.250
well as there being a mysterious cyborg
with a red laser eye who follows Vivian of

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:09.120
all people, then later we learn that
Edith is involved in some sort of

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.139
secret conspiracy that's concerned
greatly with Sam Allen and a magic circle

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:18.599
thing inscribed in the floor of Seth's
room and we also see Harlow going to the

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:22.680
Allen estate to reclaim an urn full of
ashes and to the shock of Jeff and

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:27.060
Vivian who learn that their parents
are monste hunters so by now we have

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.240
several mysteries set up: Who is this
Harlow witch woman and what does she

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.380
want? Why did Presidio kidnap Sam
and what are they after?

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:37.820
What is going on the kids?
what is with the summoning circle Fred found?

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.180
Who and what is this
guy with the red eye?

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:42.600
And most importantly who are the kids really?

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.520
and what is with the mysterious
urn that was hidden in the Allen estate?

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.840
all these questions and their 
answers are all connected together

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:53.849
tied up in a nice neat bow by the
season's finale by the time the final

00:05:53.849 --> 00:05:56.909
episode rolls around this spooky witch
who's been showing up all over the damn

00:05:56.909 --> 00:06:01.080
place, putting her nose in everyone's
business, actually has a name Alice

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:05.750
Harlow of the Warlock colony known as
the Harlow village or the Harlow house

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:10.469
this character is loosely adapted from the
comic book although her comic book

00:06:10.469 --> 00:06:14.460
counterpart is featured in like a single
panel wielding an axe before getting

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:18.840
killed off by Fred and something I
should also add is that Harlow village

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:23.009
doesn't exist in the comics and instead
it's the Harlow's house belonging to a

00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:27.449
serial killer couple who are implied to
be working with monsters anyway she, as

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:30.960
the rest of the Allens discover, is a
warlock which in this universe is a race

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:35.050
of people: innate magical practitioners
who although look human

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:40.419
are monsters. She in particular is noted
to using blood magic and much like the

00:06:40.419 --> 00:06:44.319
rest of her kind is able to form a
psychic bond of sorts with the universe

00:06:44.319 --> 00:06:49.449
and with everything within it this
metaphysical bond is something that

00:06:49.449 --> 00:06:54.009
Vivian tapped into when she did her
seance and inadvertently used to free

00:06:54.009 --> 00:06:58.419
her from her bonds and this underwater
bondage thing being a result of a band

00:06:58.419 --> 00:07:03.039
of rebel monsters she joined, tying her
up, and sort of drowning her in a lake

00:07:03.039 --> 00:07:08.560
because she was just too much for them
to handle. Now, fun fact the word 'warlock'

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:12.340
comes from an old English word meaning
"oathbreaker" what exactly this oath is I'm

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:16.030
not a cunning linguist so I can't say
but it's a very appropriate descriptor

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:20.349
for Alice as it's due to her breaking
several oaths that lead up to the life

00:07:20.349 --> 00:07:24.009
that she lives it now: she betrays the
Harlow village by inviting a human into

00:07:24.009 --> 00:07:27.550
the premises which directly leads to the
extermination of her people and the

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:31.690
destruction of Harlow house. She becomes
too 'killy' and revenge happy that she gets

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:35.319
betrayed by her monster comrades who
chain her up and then later she

00:07:35.319 --> 00:07:39.190
promises to be there for her children
but fails to protect them from Presidio

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:43.630
Mucho depresso. Now adding on to that
the reason why she's sniffing around the

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:46.779
Allens so much is because they were
directly involved with the Harlow

00:07:46.779 --> 00:07:50.409
village massacre, with Delores and Fred
having served as boots on the ground

00:07:50.409 --> 00:07:55.690
soldiers in a very grisly raid
furthermore Sam Allen was the guy who

00:07:55.690 --> 00:08:00.789
oversaw the operation go down and who
stole an urn full of the ashes of the

00:08:00.789 --> 00:08:04.930
warlocks which Alice then took back in
order to take a blood bath like

00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:10.659
literally it's super gross-- to rejuvenate
and restore her power and as I mentioned

00:08:10.659 --> 00:08:17.050
earlier we also discover that she is the
mother of Vivian and Geoff. So now we need

00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:21.069
to talk about the urn and later the
pentagram thing in Seth's room so first

00:08:21.069 --> 00:08:25.629
off the urn that is previously mentioned
contains ashes specifically of the

00:08:25.629 --> 00:08:29.620
warlocks of the Harlow village. We see
them actually doing a ritual which turns

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:33.640
this old guy into the dust which are then
stored in the urn. This ritual was done in

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:37.750
order to allow the soul to move on at
least in warlockian beliefs

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:42.310
now warlocks use the ashes of the Dead
in order to empower themselves which

00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:45.790
leads to Alice's big pro-gamer move
later in the series when she brings back

00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:48.150
these souls of the Harlow warlocks back

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:52.440
to earth and into the bodies of Barrington's
populace which brings us to the

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:56.400
pentagram thing in Seth's room which is
linked to Presidio, Sam's fake death, the

00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:01.470
red-eye guy and surprisingly the Harlow
warlocks: you see the pentagram thing

00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:04.470
in Seth's room is a form of
warlock geometric magic

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:10.020
more specifically soul magic that Sam
used to bind the soul of his son Seth to

00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:12.930
a body of a convict in order to 
bring him back to life

00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:17.670
not to brag what I totally called it but
anyway. Now because I read the comic book

00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:21.570
series this character, the red eye guy,
does exist in the comics though he's

00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:25.980
portrayed as being more mechanical and
is not Seth instead he's a young man

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:30.360
named Dante who was the subject of a
cruel experiment by a mad scientist who

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:35.070
was sort of rescued by Fred before being
placed into a box and left to sleep as

00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:39.420
he was too dangerous in Fred's words
then later on the comic Dolores wakes

00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:42.420
him up as a ploy to get Fred back into
the monster hunting business because her

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:47.460
life without it is just really boring
anyway the experiment for Sam is a

00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:51.210
success though Seth becomes a mute and
furthermore is locked inside the house

00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:55.470
by Sam, now the problem is Seth is
resurrected using decommissioned

00:09:55.470 --> 00:10:00.450
Presidio technology and Presidio really
wants their stuff back so they kidnap

00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:04.560
Sam, fake his death, and interrogate him
in order to learn how he used their

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:09.240
technology so that they can use it to
exterminate all monsters, oh, and although

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:13.110
I didn't list it as a question earlier
but in the TV show we encounter a mixed

00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:17.730
race team of monsters who are hunting
Alice Harlow, this team however not

00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:21.600
having existed in the comics instead the
closest thing we get to a mixed race

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:25.350
team of monsters is in Deadly Season
wherein Fred is kidnapped by the

00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:29.560
children of the monsters that he killed in
the past who try to kill him in the  present

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:33.560
so this plot was kicked off because
Sam just wanted his son back but

00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:38.700
something I didn't mention is how Seth
died. For a long time Fred was second

00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:43.020
best to Seth who was the golden child
for the Allen family and one day the

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:47.310
brothers went out hunting but Seth got
ambushed and murdered to death by a

00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:51.540
monster named Moshe who did so out of
revenge for his own family who were

00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:56.580
brutally killed by Seth a long time ago
in a lot of ways this story's about the

00:10:56.580 --> 00:11:00.270
cyclical nature of revenge and killing
that is bound to bring people to blows

00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:04.230
which is very much a theme in the comics
as one of the motivating factors for the

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:08.579
plot there is Fred's history of monster
hunting and some characters usually

00:11:08.579 --> 00:11:13.350
monsters wanting some revenge against
him now finally we move on to the

00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:17.660
timeline so overall the timeline of the
series go something like this October

00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:21.870
1975. Fred witnesses Seth attack a
monster that's inside their home when

00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:25.900
he's a child and gets inspired to
become a monster hunter

00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:33.040
1987 an older Fred and Dolores go out to hunt 
a monster that killed Deloris's father

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:35.640
October 1988 in New York

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:37.980
Fred and Seth are out hunting in
a bar where Seth is killed by

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:44.129
Moshe, a monster's family Seth killed some
time earlier then October 2001 Alice is

00:11:44.129 --> 00:11:47.970
residing in Harlow house or as I call it
the Harlow village which leads to the

00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:52.610
mass purge of the warlocks by Presidio
and it's here where Fred kills Omari

00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:57.870
Alice's husband and takes her kids and
when Sam takes the urn full of the ashes

00:11:57.870 --> 00:12:03.600
back to his estate then comes October
2018 Sam conducts a ritual to bring back

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:08.579
Seth back to life using warlock magic
and succeeds in a manner of speaking

00:12:08.579 --> 00:12:14.189
then in 2019 in Osaka the Allen family
get the call that Sam dies and the family

00:12:14.189 --> 00:12:19.079
moves to New York which is when the
series begins but how does it end?

00:12:19.079 --> 00:12:23.309
Well, Fred is dead and is currently stuck in
a limbo dimension with Omari, Alice's

00:12:23.309 --> 00:12:27.600
husband whom Fred killed, his soul
separated from his body, Philip and Geoff

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:30.930
are dating much like the comic book
Vivian is happier with her life in Barrington

00:12:30.930 --> 00:12:34.680
Alice is still out there somewhere
being hunted by Moshe of the monster squad

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:38.910
Sam and Seth are still alive albeit
locked up in Presidio which is now under

00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:43.230
the new leadership of Maggie, Fred's a
mother, though the finale hints at season 2

00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:47.250
which involves some sort of monster
hidden beneath the basement of the Allen

00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:52.620
estate breaking out and it does not
sound friendly and that'a season 1 of

00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:56.939
October Faction it amalgamates or
removes characters adds more backstory

00:12:56.939 --> 00:13:00.360
or world building to what was an
otherwise self-contained and focused

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:04.319
setting and I honestly was really hoping
we'd see Lucas and how he deals with

00:13:04.319 --> 00:13:08.069
lycanthropy or Merle Cope and his
general dickish attitude towards the

00:13:08.069 --> 00:13:11.550
Allens. The plot line for season one is
clearly separated from the main canon of

00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:15.080
the comics and it's anybody's guess what
they're going to change in season 2

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:18.620
- although I'm thinking they're going to
go a bit more into limbo and Fred's

00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:23.180
chance to come back to reality and if not
that then obviously the monster

00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:27.230
hunting business that they have in the
comics with that being said thank you so

00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:30.110
