00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.160
Story Recapped here. Today,&nbsp;
I'm going to explain a drama,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:09.360
fantasy, and horror film called "Wildling."&nbsp;
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.&nbsp;

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.440
&nbsp;
Deep into the woods,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:18.480
a little girl named Anna lives with her guardian,&nbsp;
Gabe, whom she calls “Daddy." Almost every night,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.480
Gabe describes to Anna what a wildling&nbsp;
looks like. A wildling has sharp teeth,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:28.000
long nails, and a hairy figure. This scares Anna,&nbsp;
whose young mind is curious about the outdoors.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.800
The little girl lives in an attic and has never&nbsp;
been outside. Gabe takes care of her by providing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.360
her basic needs and monitoring her health. He&nbsp;
only feeds Anna vegetables and prohibits her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.880
from eating meat. He is also the only human that&nbsp;
she has interacted with. One day out of boredom,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:48.960
Anna approaches the door. She hears Gabe talking&nbsp;
to someone. Feeling curious, she touches the knob,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.000
and an electric shock knocks her unconscious. She&nbsp;
wakes up to Gabe, who comforts her and explains&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.640
that the electric trap prevents the wildlings&nbsp;
from entering Anna’s room. She is the last child&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:04.000
left on Earth, so he has to protect her. Anna asks&nbsp;
about the person he was talking to, but he tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.320
her that they're the only humans left.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.920
Anna celebrates her birthday by receiving a cake&nbsp;
from Gabe. He also gives her a hamster as a gift.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.680
It's the closest thing Anna has to a friend. One&nbsp;
day, her hamster dies, so Gabe explains to her the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.560
concept of death. He also adds that the hamster&nbsp;
is now in a better place to make her feel better.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.840
That night, Anna dreams of waking&nbsp;
up in the middle of the forest.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.760
She follows a path and hides behind a tall tree&nbsp;
upon hearing noises. She sees a monstrous and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.880
werewolf-like figure feasting on someone. The&nbsp;
following morning, Gabe finds bloodstains on her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.680
bed which upsets him. He informs Anna that&nbsp;
she is sick and provides medicine for her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.880
He injects a substance into her body that prevents&nbsp;
her from maturing. Years pass and the daily dose&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.680
of injections make Anna sicker by the day.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.640
On her birthday, Gabe injects another shot of&nbsp;
medicine. It becomes harder to communicate with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.800
Anna because of the medicine’s side effects.&nbsp;
That day, she asks him to take her to “the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.680
better place.” It takes him by surprise, and he&nbsp;
sheds tears after coming to terms with the fact&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:09.360
that she's dying. Moments later, Gabe brings a&nbsp;
gun to end Anna’s suffering. However, he cannot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.480
bring himself to shoot her and instead turns the&nbsp;
gun on himself. After the incident, Anna wakes up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:20.080
in a hospital. Panic takes over her as she sees&nbsp;
unfamiliar people in a foreign place. She gets up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.960
as soon as she gains consciousness and runs toward&nbsp;
the hallway despite being stopped by doctors.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.840
She sees a ladder and climbs it. She goes to the&nbsp;
rooftop and basks in the sun for the first time.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.280
Medical personnel runs to her rescue and brings&nbsp;
her back to a room. When she wakes up again,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.640
Ellen Cooper, the local sheriff, introduces&nbsp;
herself. Ellen says she rescued her after&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.440
neighbors reported a gunshot at Gabe's home.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.840
The physician excuses Ellen and informs her&nbsp;
that Anna’s body is low on estrogen because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.120
of the injections. He further tells her that she&nbsp;
has no history of having a menstrual cycle. Both&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.320
of them conclude that Gabe had terrible intentions&nbsp;
towards Anna. Ellen reenters the room and unstraps&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.800
Anna to make her more comfortable. Anna seems to&nbsp;
be calmer with the officer compared to others.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.920
She asks about Gabe, so the sheriff accompanies&nbsp;
her to his room, where he is under intensive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.320
care. She grows worried about the condition of&nbsp;
the only person she knows for her whole life.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.040
The following morning, another doctor&nbsp;
recommends discharging Anna to a therapy house.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:22.640
Ellen objects to locking up Anna once again, but&nbsp;
the doctor insists that therapy will help her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.280
However, Anna expresses wanting to stay with&nbsp;
Ellen. The sheriff will take care of her while&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.160
they wait for the D.N.A. tests to discover her&nbsp;
identity and if Gabe is her biological father.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.080
Both of them drive to Ellen’s home while Anna&nbsp;
observes the outdoors for the first time.&nbsp;

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.960
&nbsp;
They arrive at Ellen’s house, and she asks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:44.960
Anna if she is hungry. She gives Anna a hamburger.&nbsp;
It is the first time that she tastes meat. In the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:50.880
meantime, Ellen’s brother, Ray, arrives home as&nbsp;
well. That night, while Ellen prepares the room&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.600
for Anna to sleep in, Anna asks her to close the&nbsp;
window, fearing that a wildling will attack her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.720
Gabe’s stories still consume her thoughts. Ellen&nbsp;
returns to Gabe's house and enters the attic.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.960
She discovers a disturbing image drawn&nbsp;
by Anna of a wildling eating a human.&nbsp;

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:08.160
&nbsp;
The following day, Ellen finds Anna sleeping in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:13.600
a closet. She then wakes the poor girl up to have&nbsp;
some breakfast. Ellen sees her barefoot as Anna&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:19.200
stares into the vast forest. Anna has a vision&nbsp;
of her running and the northern lights. Later on,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:24.080
Ray shows her around after picking up some&nbsp;
groceries and reveals to Anna how babies are made.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.880
He finds her ignorance entertaining, so he lets&nbsp;
her view explicit content from the internet.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.280
As they spend more time together, Ray&nbsp;
notices the weird behaviors that Anna shows,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:38.720
like eating as if she is hungry all the time and&nbsp;
refusing to use table utensils. Ellen picks Anna’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:44.000
dirty clothes from the closet and notices blood&nbsp;
on her pants. She hands Anna a box of tampons,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.200
but she has no idea about its purpose. Ellen tells&nbsp;
her that she is now a woman, and she should use it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.280
to control the blood down there.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.760
Anna attends the local high school to make her&nbsp;
time more valuable. She observes her peers from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:00.640
a distance and remains in amazement. A fellow&nbsp;
student shows her the library and invites her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:05.280
to a party over the weekend. This makes Anna&nbsp;
smile as she feels a sense of belonging. She&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.840
has a habit of going barefoot wherever she goes,&nbsp;
and the other students laugh at her for it. She&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:14.640
develops superhuman hearing and feels drawn to&nbsp;
the forest and the Northern lights. Anna ends up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:19.760
in a school back door where she meets Lawrence and&nbsp;
another student. They threaten her, and Ray ends&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:24.160
up getting beat by the two guys, but Anna protects&nbsp;
him by throwing a punch at Lawrence’s friend.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.160
&nbsp;
Anna has the freedom to be outside&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:31.600
and explore nature now that she is under Ellen’s&nbsp;
care. She spots a lone deer and chases after it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:37.360
A grizzled man known as “The Wolf Man” stalks Anna&nbsp;
after seeing her alone. Her running abilities are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:42.480
beyond impressive despite her being immobile&nbsp;
for years. Out of nowhere, The Wolf Man appears&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:47.600
in front of her. The Wolf Man stops Anna from&nbsp;
triggering a hunter's trap, which might hurt her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:52.080
He demonstrates how the trap works, and&nbsp;
she realizes that he intends to help her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:57.520
Afterward, Anna comes to the library to learn more&nbsp;
about feral predators. She browses through pages&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:02.160
of the book and suddenly notices black marks on&nbsp;
her fingernails. While Ellen teaches her how to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:06.720
clean herself, Anna notices the sheriff’s red&nbsp;
pedicure. She thinks that having color on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:11.840
nails is normal after seeing it. Ellen also breaks&nbsp;
the news that D.N.A.'s results show that Gabe is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:17.280
not her birth father. Her reaction is puzzling.&nbsp;
The concept of family is still unclear to her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:18.400
&nbsp;
Ray and Anna hang&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:23.200
out at the rooftop that night. Ray attempts to&nbsp;
tutor her about a school assignment, but she is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:29.040
uninterested. Instead, she asks about the northern&nbsp;
lights as they lay down together. Anna sniffs him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:33.760
and tells him that he smells like a hamburger. She&nbsp;
notices flickering lights from a great distance&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:39.120
and asks Ray what it is. He replies by saying&nbsp;
that it is a party at Jen’s house. Anna tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:43.840
him that Jen is her friend, and they both head&nbsp;
out to her party. This is the first time for her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:48.800
to be surrounded by her peers closely. She takes&nbsp;
her first drink and feels slightly fazed after.

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:54.080
Ray and Anna share a brief romantic moment&nbsp;
at the party, which Lawrence notices.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:57.360
All of a sudden, Anna’s mouth begins&nbsp;
bleeding, which ends their kiss.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.480
She rushes to the bathroom for some privacy and&nbsp;
realizes that she is losing some of her teeth.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:08.320
Feeling horrified, Anna flees out the window and&nbsp;
runs away. She goes into the woods and senses that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:12.560
something or someone might be following her.&nbsp;
Anna tries her best to be alert and vigilant&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:16.960
at the moment. What seems to be a wildling&nbsp;
attacks her from behind and removes her clothes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:22.320
She tries to fight it with all her will, and in&nbsp;
defense, she bites it. She then realizes that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:27.920
it is Lawrence, not a wildling. The teenage boy&nbsp;
tried to force himself on Anna and ended up dying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:29.680
because of blood loss.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:33.840
She returns to Gabe’s home in hopes of&nbsp;
knowing more about herself. She ascends&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:37.920
into the attic and enters her old bedroom.&nbsp;
Despite the barred window and tight space,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:42.960
the place brings her a sense of home and safety.&nbsp;
While blood runs through her face, Anna remembers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:48.480
Lawrence’s lifeless body in the woods. She cleans&nbsp;
herself and heads to town right away. A group&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:54.160
of men menacingly looks at her while she strolls&nbsp;
barefoot. Luckily, Ellen stumbles upon her, asking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:59.360
where she spent the night. Anna does not let&nbsp;
out a single word. She is heavily confused about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:05.120
what she did and refuses to share anything with&nbsp;
Ellen. Roger, another officer, knocks at the home.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:11.040
As Ellen gets up, Anna spits out another tooth&nbsp;
which still stirs confusion in her. She realizes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:15.360
that sharper teeth are causing her human teeth&nbsp;
to fall out, and her nails are slowly becoming&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:20.400
claw-like. Roger informs Ellen that Lawrence’s&nbsp;
father has informed authorities that he did not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:25.840
come home, just like Anna. He raises suspicions&nbsp;
about Anna, but Ellen dismisses the thought.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:28.480
&nbsp;
Ellen storms inside to ask Anna if she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:33.680
knows anything, but she remains quiet. She starts&nbsp;
to get annoyed because Anna chooses to ignore her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:38.960
and paint her nails instead. Ray walks in to check&nbsp;
on Anna and tells his sister that he will talk to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:43.680
her. Anna still chooses to stay silent despite&nbsp;
Ray’s reassurance that he will keep her safe.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:48.160
He slightly opens her mouth and finds&nbsp;
out that she is missing teeth rapidly.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:53.760
He rushes outside to inform Ellen, but Anna takes&nbsp;
the opportunity to run away as fast as she could.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:59.120
She ends up in a mountainous area overlooking the&nbsp;
town. The forest brings her a sense of safety as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:04.800
if she belongs there. In the woods, she encounters&nbsp;
The Wolf Man once again. He offers her food and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:10.000
sees that she is starving. The wolfman grabs her&nbsp;
to check her nails and teeth. It confirms his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.040
theory that she might be a wildling. He then tells&nbsp;
her that he has not seen any of her kind since the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:17.840
town conducted a purge sixteen years ago.
&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:20.800
The Wolf Man asks Anna if she&nbsp;
wants to know where her mother is.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:26.720
Feeling intrigued, she follows him to a nearby&nbsp;
cavern. Inside, she discovers a skull with a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:31.280
bullet hole in the forehead. She holds it closer&nbsp;
and sees a vision of Gabe shooting her mother.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:36.800
It turns out Gabe participated in the purge 16&nbsp;
years ago. He could not bring himself to shoot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:41.760
the human-looking baby Anna, so instead,&nbsp;
he hid her away. Anna feels betrayed;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:46.640
she goes to the hospital and heads to Gabe’s room.&nbsp;
He takes a glimpse of her, but she isn’t ready to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:48.640
confront him about the truth.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:53.680
Meanwhile, Ellen studies the case file from the&nbsp;
death of Lawrence. She sees a resemblance of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:59.040
drawing from Anna’s old room to the situation&nbsp;
at hand. Eventually, Anna arrives at the house&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:04.320
and hugs Ellen desperately. Ellen sees her&nbsp;
claw-like nails and handcuffs her. She explains&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:08.560
that the police have discovered Lawrence's&nbsp;
body beside the dress Anna wore last night.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:13.840
Because of the evidence, Anna is sent to jail,&nbsp;
where Ellen apologizes to her. Anna feels lonely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:18.480
again after being locked up. She looks at&nbsp;
the mirror and notices sharp teeth growing,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:23.520
similar to the skull she held. Before leaving,&nbsp;
Ellen brings Anna some hamburgers for her to eat.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:28.480
That night, Gabe visits her and explains that&nbsp;
sparing her life was his greatest mistake because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:33.440
it meant breaking his oath "to kill all the&nbsp;
Wildlings.” He passes Anna a syringe and convinces&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:38.320
her to inject herself, which will bring her to&nbsp;
a better place. Anna finally accepts that she is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:43.520
a wildling and refuses to use the injection. Gabe&nbsp;
becomes emotional as he leaves Anna in her cell.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:46.720
&nbsp;
The following day, Ellen checks on Anna,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:52.880
who is sleeping under the bed. She opens the cell,&nbsp;
but Anna attacks her unexpectedly. Anna locks the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:59.040
officer, then flees. She runs to the car where Ray&nbsp;
waits. She commands him to drive, and he steps on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:04.960
the gas. They head for the woods, and Anna reveals&nbsp;
to Ray that she is a wildling. He has no idea what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:10.240
it is, and Anna refuses to share more about it.&nbsp;
She exits the vehicle goes deep into the woods,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:16.080
where she feels most safe. In the dark, Anna&nbsp;
swims in a nearby lake and ends up soaking wet.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:21.120
Ray sets up a bonfire and removes Anna’s clothes&nbsp;
to dry it. Both of them have an intimate moment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:25.920
together despite Ray feeling hair growing on her&nbsp;
back. Anna assures him that he is safe and she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:27.440
won’t harm him.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:32.720
Roger and Gabe meet to discuss Anna's escape.&nbsp;
Gabe is upset at what happened. They organize&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:37.760
hunters to go after Anna in hopes of taking her&nbsp;
captive. Anna and Ray run as search dogs are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:43.440
released into the forest to find her. However, Ray&nbsp;
gets shot after a group of hunters ambush them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:48.720
They struggle to find a way out as they end up on&nbsp;
a cliff. Anna pushes Ray first, then dives into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:53.760
the water to escape. Knowing that Ray's life&nbsp;
is in danger, Anna runs the other way, leading&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:58.640
the hunters in her direction. Ray reunites with&nbsp;
his sister and informs her that Anna is “gone."&nbsp;

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:01.520
&nbsp;
Anna is now on her own and adapts to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:07.440
desperate measures to survive. She has transformed&nbsp;
almost entirely into a wildling. She covers her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:12.880
face and body with dirt as camouflage. Weeks&nbsp;
have passed, and Ellen is still on Anna's case.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:18.640
One night, Anna twitches around and transforms&nbsp;
into her final form. In her true appearance,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:21.280
Anna is almost unrecognizable.
&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:26.400
On his daily stroll, Ray notices Roger filling&nbsp;
gas in a truck. He thinks that they are on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:30.720
move to kill and hunt Anna down. He immediately&nbsp;
calls Ellen to inform her about their plan.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:36.320
On their expedition, Anna manages to kill a&nbsp;
hunter after knocking him to the ground. The group&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:41.440
gathers around the body and continues to look for&nbsp;
her. At the same time, Ellen arrives at the forest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:46.480
to rescue Anna from the hunters. However, she&nbsp;
gets stronger by the day as her skills grow more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:52.320
robust. Anna manages to kill another hunter after&nbsp;
setting up the same trap that The Wolf Man showed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:56.960
Roger holds Ellen at gunpoint after discovering&nbsp;
the body. Because of this, Anna kills him as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:01.200
She reveals herself to Ellen and shows&nbsp;
her pregnant belly before running away.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:04.640
&nbsp;
The hunters set the forest on fire, which agitates&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:10.400
Anna even more. She runs to see the fire that is&nbsp;
taking over her home. She finds a way to get past&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:15.280
this, but her pregnancy limits her strength. This&nbsp;
leaves her no choice but to dig underground to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:19.840
escape the heat. She tirelessly digs and ends&nbsp;
up in a similar cavern where she was found.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:25.280
Unfortunately, Gabe tracks her down and&nbsp;
tranquilizes her. The shot takes away the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:30.320
remaining strength she has, causing her to fall to&nbsp;
the ground. Gabe approaches her to check her vital&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:36.160
signs. He recalls the familiar feeling of seeing&nbsp;
Anna’s mother. He performs a c-section on Anna&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:40.800
to claim the unborn child, but she regains her&nbsp;
strength and uses the fire on Gabe so she could&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:46.720
escape. After waiting for the timing, she leaves&nbsp;
a big bite on Gabe’s neck, killing him. Anna lets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:52.000
out an angry shriek before falling to the ground&nbsp;
once again. Upon gaining consciousness, she sees&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:57.040
The Wolf Man stitching her wounds. The following&nbsp;
day, Ellen and Ray see Anna from a distance.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:02.160
They allow her to escape into the wilderness,&nbsp;
which will be better for her. Eventually,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:07.280
Anna reaches the northern lights, which is her&nbsp;
ultimate goal. She holds her newborn child while&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:12.960
looking at the beautiful sky. She feels at peace&nbsp;
and content with the life she is living. Suddenly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:17.760
Anna hears a wildling from a distance, which means&nbsp;
that their kind might rise and live freely again.&nbsp;
