00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.760
Story Recapped here. Today&nbsp;
I'm going to explain a horror,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:06.320
music, and thriller film&nbsp;
called “We Summon The Darkness"&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:11.120
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:18.080
In Indiana, in July 1988, punk&nbsp;
best friends Alexis, Val, and Bev&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.600
go on a road trip to watch their favorite&nbsp;
bands perform at a heavy metal concert.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.920
As they stop at a gas station, Bev reads&nbsp;
a newspaper article with the headline:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.880
“teens slain in new satanic killings” and gets&nbsp;
creeped out by it, while Alexis makes fun of her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.280
On the counter, the station owner listens to&nbsp;
a religious broadcast about how people who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.160
listen to heavy metal are hell-bound, making&nbsp;
the whole situation awkward. Back in the car,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.560
the trio also hears about the prevalent killings&nbsp;
related to satanic cults around the country.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.640
Bev gets too tired of hearing it, so she changes&nbsp;
the station. Out of nowhere, a blue vehicle&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.280
overtakes them and throws a milkshake at their&nbsp;
windshield. They stop by the side of the road and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.480
clean their car up, feeling incredibly pissed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.200
Eventually, they arrive at the concert.&nbsp;
As expected, many people have turned up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:10.720
to attend. The three agree on downing some drinks,&nbsp;
needing a bit of liquid courage to enjoy the show,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.360
before heading out. Not long after, the&nbsp;
girls notice the blue van from earlier,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.000
whose passengers threw a milkshake at their car.&nbsp;
They concoct a mean plan to get their payback.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:26.800
Val throws a pack of small firecrackers&nbsp;
inside, alarming the three boys, Ivan, Kovacs,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:33.360
and Mark. They hurriedly climb out of the vehicle&nbsp;
and see the girls laughing at their expense.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.080
Realizing that the girls are just getting their&nbsp;
revenge, Ivan makes it up to them by offering&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:43.440
them some cold beers, a peace offering the girls&nbsp;
willingly accept. Forming an unlikely friendship,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.200
the group talks more about their love for music&nbsp;
and the bands that will perform at the show.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.640
In the middle of their discussion, Bev notices&nbsp;
a book about satanic rituals inside the van,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.080
sensing that something is off&nbsp;
about the boys. She ignores this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.880
and they hang out with them anyway. As the&nbsp;
concert starts, they all enjoy the show,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.280
dancing and singing along together.
&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.520
After the concert, Alexis decides that the&nbsp;
night is still young and invites the three&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.720
boys to her father’s mansion. The boys like the&nbsp;
idea of hanging out with a group of pretty girls,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.120
so they accept the kind invitation and&nbsp;
drive off to the property. On their arrival,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.880
Alexis shows them around some of the rooms and&nbsp;
gives a brief run-through of the whole place.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.760
They all decide to have a drink by a campfire in&nbsp;
the backyard while they continue talking about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.040
upcoming rock bands. Throughout the night, Bev&nbsp;
starts to act weirdly and out of her character.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.160
When Alexis asks her, she merely replies by saying&nbsp;
that she’s never done anything like this before.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.000
Alexis reassures her that everything will be&nbsp;
fine as long as she just follows her lead.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.440
Bev is convinced to mingle with the group and&nbsp;
heads outside. She bumps into Mark, spilling her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:51.040
drink. Mark offers her his jacket, where she&nbsp;
finds a pocket knife inside. She walks away,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.360
feeling disturbed and wondering why he’s&nbsp;
casually carrying a sharp weapon with him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.080
She expresses her concerns to Alexis, but she&nbsp;
only tells her worried friend to relax and enjoy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.280
the night.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.680
After they make a toast to having a memorable&nbsp;
night, Alexis initiates a game of Never Have I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.920
Ever, and they all share laughs and exchange&nbsp;
stories about funny experiences they have tried.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.360
Suddenly, Alexis says, “Never have I ever&nbsp;
drugged someone’s drink.” None of them take a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.960
shot initially, but Ivan and Kovacs are surprised&nbsp;
to see the three girls take one. In a long stretch&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:26.080
of silence, the girls reveal that they drugged&nbsp;
the drinks beforehand. The boys then slowly pass&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:32.000
out one by one. As the girls wake them up, Ivan,&nbsp;
Mark, and Kovacs find themselves tied to chairs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.040
in a room filled with candles. Val and Alexis&nbsp;
keep taunting the boys in a menacing and sinister&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.280
way while Bev stands behind them, observing&nbsp;
the whole situation as it is her first time.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.000
The three boys desperately ask them to let them&nbsp;
go while screaming for help, but it proves to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.560
be ineffective.&nbsp; It turns out that the three&nbsp;
girls are members of a congregation called,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.440
The Daughters of the Dawn. Their members are also&nbsp;
responsible for the several murders circling the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.640
country. Every week, a specific group is assigned&nbsp;
to conduct brutal crimes to practice what they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.440
believe in. They explain further that the reason&nbsp;
behind it is to create fear among the nation and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:10.480
send more people to join their religion. When Mark&nbsp;
asks more critical questions about the religion,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.360
Alexis becomes more agitated in explaining and&nbsp;
reasoning out the logic of their congregation.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:20.720
Meanwhile, Ivan has had enough of her big speech.&nbsp;
He continues to look down on their beliefs, saying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:26.000
that it is nothing short of pointless and stupid.&nbsp;
Alexis becomes furious and stabs him in the neck,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.120
causing him to bleed to death. She then approaches&nbsp;
Mark, commanding him to beg for forgiveness while&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.920
she holds him at knifepoint. Just as Alexis&nbsp;
is about to stab him, Bev holds her back,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:40.080
saying they need to talk about something&nbsp;
urgent. Val and Alexis hesitantly follow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.240
her out of the room, giving the two boys an&nbsp;
opportunity to come up with a plan to escape.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.200
&nbsp;
In the bathroom, Bev tells both of them that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:52.560
she wants to be the one who kills Mark and Kovacs.&nbsp;
Alexis agrees so she gives out instructions on how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.680
to bring them out. However, the two boys briefly&nbsp;
escape and find a safe room to hide so that they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:03.040
could spare more time. But as they hear the trio&nbsp;
approaching, they get trapped inside the pantry.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:06.240
The girls are unaware that the boys are&nbsp;
hiding right behind the pantry door.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:11.280
Inside, Mark tends to Kovacs’ wounds which&nbsp;
he got while trying to flee from the girls.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.640
Meanwhile, to speed up the process of their&nbsp;
agenda, Alexis orders Bev to find tools so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:22.000
they could break the door quickly. She hesitantly&nbsp;
abides after Alexis blames the nuisance on her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.640
Shaken by everything she has witnessed, Bev tries&nbsp;
her best to maintain composure while getting tools&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:28.400
from a nearby shed.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:33.040
In the house, chaos is just about to start&nbsp;
again when Alexis finds aerosol and sprays it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:38.160
by the door, causing Mark and Kovacs to cough&nbsp;
and have difficulty breathing. Suddenly, they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:43.120
hear someone arrive at the house and immediately&nbsp;
stop what they are doing to find out who it is.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:49.680
To Alexis’ surprise, her stepmother, Susan, came&nbsp;
by the house to retrieve a passport she needed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:54.800
for her trip the next day. Before leaving, she&nbsp;
informs Alexis that she called the police because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:59.360
she saw a strange blue van parked and the lights&nbsp;
on, thinking that someone might have broken in,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:04.480
but realizes that it was just a false alarm.&nbsp;
Just as she makes her way out, Susan hears broken&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:08.880
bottles in the pantry and senses that something&nbsp;
is going on, so she tries to make her way there to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:14.560
find out on her own. Alexis repeatedly says that&nbsp;
nothing is there, but her actions seem defensive,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:19.280
making Susan more curious. Susan discovers&nbsp;
Ivan's lifeless body in the living room.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:24.640
This forces Alexis to take a fatal course of&nbsp;
action and immediately stabs her. The commotion&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:29.600
makes Val panic for some time as killing an extra&nbsp;
person was not part of their plan. To make things&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:32.000
worse, the police are on their way.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.920
All the while, Bev is still at the shed,&nbsp;
unable to face the chaos in the house.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:41.120
She scours through some documents that contain&nbsp;
property titles owned by Alexis’ father,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:46.080
John Henry, and a bag of money. In the pantry,&nbsp;
Mark and Kovacs prepare to battle the girls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:51.120
with broken wine bottles, but Alexis and Val use&nbsp;
an aerosol spray to put flames by the doorway.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:56.480
This puts the boys in a much more vulnerable&nbsp;
position, given that they are trapped inside.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:02.640
At that exact moment, an officer named Sheriff&nbsp;
Dembrowski arrives at the house as a response&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:07.760
to Susan’s call, and Alexis tries to reason out&nbsp;
with the officer so that he could leave. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:13.520
Dembrowski is not shaken by her charms and alibis,&nbsp;
so he requires Alexis to provide an I.D., but she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:18.960
runs away instead. He chases her into the house&nbsp;
and comes across the sight of satanic symbols, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:23.920
Ivan’s corpse in the living room. The scene gets&nbsp;
him in complete disbelief and terror, making him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:28.720
more vigilant of his surroundings. After hearing&nbsp;
noises from the pantry, he finds the injured&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:33.520
Kovacs and Mark, who pleads for help. Dembrowski&nbsp;
refuses to believe them, putting them in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:39.520
handcuffs. Unbeknownst to him, Val sneaks up from&nbsp;
behind him, takes his weapon, and shoots him dead,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:44.720
making the two boys enter the pantry once again.&nbsp;
Upon finding out that Val killed Dembrowski,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:49.280
Alexis freaks out and takes the gun away from&nbsp;
her, but she refuses, causing them to brawl.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:51.200
&nbsp;
As they fight over the weapon,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:55.760
Bev appears out of nowhere and threatens her&nbsp;
friends with an electric trolling motor. She tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:55.760 --> 00:08:00.320
them that she will let the boys go despite their&nbsp;
contradictions. Her friends tell Bev that they are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:05.360
practicing the Lord's work, but Bev has had enough&nbsp;
of all the lies, revealing that Alexis’ father,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:10.640
one of the religions’ leaders, is simply pocketing&nbsp;
the donations made by members. Instead of building&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:15.120
shelters which he promised, he spends the money&nbsp;
on purchasing luxurious houses like the one they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:20.480
are in. While Alexis calls Bev a lost lamb for not&nbsp;
thinking straight and participating in their plan,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:26.000
Val sneaks up on her, and she manages to knock&nbsp;
Bev down. An enraged Bev inflicts wounds on both&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.200
her friends using the trolling motor just as Mark&nbsp;
and Kovacs gather the courage to exit the pantry.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:36.080
They set their eyes on Bev and attack her. This&nbsp;
allows Alexis and Val to run away when the two&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:38.800
boys realize that Bev is on their side.
&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:43.600
As time passes, Kovacs’ condition worsens and he&nbsp;
will not last much longer unless he is brought&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:48.480
to a hospital. Willing to get out, Mark grabs&nbsp;
a knife to retrieve the car keys from Alexis&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:52.320
while Bev helps the bloody Kovacs hide in a&nbsp;
safe corner as they deal with her friends.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:57.280
When Kovacs spots car lights from outside,&nbsp;
he makes his way out despite his struggles.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:03.680
There, he finds John Henry, the pastor of the&nbsp;
Daughters of the Dawn, and also Alexis’ father.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:10.160
Initially, John Henry opens a casual conversation&nbsp;
with Kovacs, who is utterly distressed. Then,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:15.840
he instructs Kovacs to go to the car, call&nbsp;
9-1-1, and hand him the weapon. Kovacs follows&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:21.120
his instructions but suddenly recognizes him as&nbsp;
the famous pastor. John Henry notices the look&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:26.400
of recognition and mercilessly shoots him dead.&nbsp;
In the dark home, the last remaining people try&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:31.680
their best to be as quiet as possible, which is&nbsp;
their tool for survival. It now draws a thin line&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:37.040
between life and death, as every move and sound&nbsp;
is crucial. When Bev tracks the light switch,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:42.000
Val sneaks up on her again to prevent her from&nbsp;
turning the light back on. Without a choice, they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.720
beat each other up despite their friendship, and&nbsp;
Bev lights Val’s hair full of hairspray on fire,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:49.360
giving her a way to put the power back on.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:54.080
Meanwhile, Mark manages to get a hold of his&nbsp;
car keys in the bedroom, but Alexis fights him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:59.760
causing a big fight inside the room. Unexpectedly,&nbsp;
Kovacs makes it back inside the house, where Bev&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:05.120
comes to his rescue. Before he dies, he pleads&nbsp;
with Bev to save Mark no matter what, his final&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:10.160
act of honoring their friendship. In a matter of&nbsp;
minutes, John Henry shoots Mark, who is strangling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:15.040
Alexis in the bedroom. John Henry berates his&nbsp;
daughter for not controlling the situation,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:20.400
costing more bodies for him to cover up. In tears,&nbsp;
Alexis explains that it isn’t her fault, but her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:24.480
father says they have to make some sacrifices to&nbsp;
get out of the trouble she has caused the group.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:29.440
John Henry attempts to strangle Alexis when Bev&nbsp;
comes from behind and knocks him unconscious.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.560
After thanking Bev for saving her, Alexis still&nbsp;
acts manically and strangles her in return.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:39.760
Dramatically, Bev throws her right out of a window&nbsp;
as an act of self-defense before coming to Mark’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:44.480
rescue. Both of them flee the house, leaving&nbsp;
all of the dead bodies behind in cold blood.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:48.960
The two jump into the car and do not even take&nbsp;
a moment to look at the scene that overtook the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:54.880
place. To their surprise, they see Alexis bravely&nbsp;
standing on their way, hungry for more brutality,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:57.840
leaving no choice but for Bev to run her over.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:01.760
The following day, news reports about the&nbsp;
incident are broadcasted on television.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:06.160
John Henry, who made it out alive,&nbsp;
turns himself into a victim,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:10.800
claiming that his daughter, Alexis, joined a&nbsp;
satanic cult called “We Summon The Darkness,”&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:16.080
causing everything to go downhill. At the same gas&nbsp;
station they stopped at, Bev gathers some medical&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:21.200
supplies to tend to her wounds and sees the owner&nbsp;
watching the news. Before leaving, she reminds him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:26.320
not to believe everything he sees, but the old&nbsp;
man just gets puzzled by this. Back in the car,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:28.880
Bev and Mark leave the town and&nbsp;
the darkness it has caused them.&nbsp;
