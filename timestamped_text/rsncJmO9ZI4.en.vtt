see her again but catherine could only tell her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:37.120
that she doesn't know with catherine being home&nbsp;
later than usual david quickly interrogates her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:44.640
he demands to know if she is having an affair if&nbsp;
she is in love and catherine asked if it makes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:52.240
a difference david tells her that it does&nbsp;
she ask him if he is in love and david gets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:59.360
mad for being the new subject of interrogation&nbsp;
when catherine was the one who was gone the&nbsp;&nbsp;

women's beauty and that it doesn't mean he's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:21.680

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:10.960
as she tells her that they need to stop whatever's&nbsp;
