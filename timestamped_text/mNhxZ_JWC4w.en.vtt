Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:06.970
Today, I'm going to explain a horror, sci-fi,
thriller film called “Existenz.”

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:08.340
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.310
Watch out and take care.

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:15.320
Ted is an intern at Antenna Research, the
world’s leading game manufacturer.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.390
He’s manning the door at a game developer
conference where a small crowd is gathered

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.330
at what appears to be a small church.

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.580
Antenna’s renowned game designer, Allegra
Geller, introduces her latest creation.

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:32.189
The crowd listens excitedly as Allegra discusses
her new game, Existenz, and how it would be

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.110
the next groundbreaking game of the decade.

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:40.190
Players would plug into their consoles, called
game pods, and enter a virtual-reality world.

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.050
The consoles they use appear to be made of
organic material that looks like a blob of

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:45.080
flesh.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.970
These are then plugged into their bodies at
the base of their spines via an umbilical

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:50.970
cord, also made of flesh.

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.760
Several audience members are then selected
to join Allegra in Existenz.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.390
A tardy audience member arrives, and Ted checks
his belongings using a metal detector for

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.160
any concealed weapons or recording equipment.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.440
He comes out clean, and he then joins the
audience.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.820
The volunteers and Allegra then enter Existenz,
going into a dream-like state.

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.740
The newly-arrived audience member suddenly
stands up and points a gun at Allegra.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.390
He walks up to her, proclaiming he would end
Allegra Geller, calling her a demoness.

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.790
He shoots but only hits Allegra’s shoulder.

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.770
The crowd scrambles and other security officers
draw their guns and shoot the man repeatedly.

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.130
Ted sees the man’s gun, noticing that it
looks as if it had been made out of bone and

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:31.130
ligaments.

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.229
Regardless, he arms himself with it and runs
to Allegra, escorting her out.

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:38.060
They get into a car and drive into the countryside.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.030
Ted asks Allegra if she knows what to do,
and Allegra says she didn’t even know people

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.460
wanted her dead.

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.880
Allegra says the countryside is full of game
developers, and Ted finds hope, saying someone

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.130
could help them.

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.810
Ted gets a phone call from Antenna, but Allegra
grabs his phone and throws it out the window,

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.400
saying whoever wants her dead could track
their location through his phone.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.950
Allegra thinks they’d be better off remaining
in hiding as they don’t know who they could

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:01.950
trust.

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.170
They pull over to the side of the road, and
Ted tries removing the bullet in Allegra’s

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:07.170
shoulder.

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.310
He fishes out the projectile and sees that
it wasn’t a bullet that penetrated her but

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:11.420
a tooth.

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.090
They take a look at the strange bone pistol
again and see that the bullets in the magazine

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.090
are teeth.

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.420
Ted notes that the gun is made entirely out
of organic material, the perfect weapon for

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.040
evading a metal detector.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.190
They arrive at a motel, and Allegra walks
up to Ted and tries to feel up his back, looking

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:28.820
for Ted’s bio port.

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.591
The bio port is a hole at the base of the
spine where the game pod’s umbilical cord

00:02:32.591 --> 00:02:33.591
connects to.

00:02:33.591 --> 00:02:36.310
Ted says he never got a bio port installed.

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.760
Allegra is surprised and realizes Ted must
have never played any virtual reality games

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.480
his whole life since he doesn’t have a bio
port.

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.260
Ted says he doesn’t like the feeling of
having something penetrating his body.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.459
Allegra says having bio ports installed is
safe and straightforward, citing how people

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:55.970
even do it in malls, but Ted counters, saying
there’s also a chance of permanent spinal

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:57.260
paralysis.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.980
Allegra laughs this off, telling Ted he’s
missing out on a lot.

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.560
Allegra then takes her game pod and tells
Ted it had been damaged during the panic at

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:05.750
the church.

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.090
She says she needs to enter the game as soon
as possible to see if it has been corrupted.

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.569
She would need the help of another individual
to enter the game with her to see if the game

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:15.020
still works.

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:19.770
Ted agrees, and they head to a gas station
to have an illegal bio port inserted in him.

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:25.730
At the gas station, they meet the attendant,
Gas, who recognizes Allegra and decides to

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:26.750
help.

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.420
Gas confesses that Allegra’s games have
changed his life by providing him an escape

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.200
from the mundaneness.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.519
Ted and Gas head in while Allegra looks around
outside.

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:40.030
She then sees a strange two-headed mutated
creature, admiring it and caressing it.

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:45.239
She heads back inside and sees Ted keeping
Gas at bay, afraid to have the bio port installed.

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:48.620
Allegra steps in, trying to convince Ted to
proceed.

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.890
As she tries to talk Ted into it, Gas shoots
Ted with the port installer, causing Ted to

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:54.420
fall on his face.

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:59.230
Ted panics, saying he can’t feel his legs,
but Gas calms him down, saying it’s only

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:00.580
temporary.

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:05.040
Allegra is excited to enter the game and plugs
the game pod’s umbilical cords into herself

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.260
and Ted.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.239
She turns the game pod on, but the pod sparks
and short circuits.

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:15.340
Allegra is infuriated, blaming Ted for destroying
her pod, but Ted argues he did nothing wrong.

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:19.489
He didn’t feel anything, nor did he do anything
to influence the pod.

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:23.840
Nevertheless, Allegra is distraught, saying
her pod is the sole game pod that contains

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.960
the only copy of Existenz.

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.830
She poured years of her life and millions
of dollars developing the game, and now it’s

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:32.340
stuck inside a defective game pod.

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.620
Ted apologizes but tells her that he didn’t
do anything wrong, maintaining he felt nothing

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.460
from when she turned the pod on.

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.270
Gas then walks in, agreeing with Ted while
pointing a shotgun at them.

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:46.150
Gas reveals a five million dollar bounty on
Allegra’s head, and he’s keen on collecting

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.000
the reward for himself.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.030
He also reveals that he had intentionally
installed a defective bio port into Ted to

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:55.810
short out the game as there’s also a reward
for destroying Existenz.

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:59.710
Allegra tries to dissuade Gas, saying the
people who want her dead would never pay him

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:01.900
the money and could even kill him too.

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.810
Ted then grabs the bio port installer and
shoots Gas through the neck.

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:07.630
Gas falls to the floor, lifeless.

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:13.360
After two close calls with assassins, Allegra
decides to visit Kiri Vinokur, a game pod

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.520
engineer.

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:18.930
Ted spots the same two-headed creature, and
Allegra says it’s probably a mutated salamander

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:20.560
frog lizard thing.

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.340
They both shrug it off and enter Kiri’s
cabin.

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:27.310
Kiri welcomes them in and tells Allegra he’s
heard of the rumors surrounding Allegra’s

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:30.150
bounty and assures them they’ll be safe
in his house.

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:34.370
Allegra hands Kiri her shorted-out game pod,
and Kiri begins work on it.

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:39.300
Kiri and his assistant assess the game pod’s
condition meticulously while Ted watches.

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:43.639
Ted notes that the game pod looks like an
animal, and Kiri laughs, saying the game pods

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:44.949
might as well be animals.

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:49.800
They are created from special tissue grown
from genetically modified amphibians and mixed

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.449
with synthetic D.N.A.

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:56.080
Kiri repairs Allegra’s pod successfully,
noting how lucky she is, seeing how the game

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.740
doesn’t seem to be corrupted.

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:01.919
Kiri then replaces Ted’s bio port and inserts
a functioning one.

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:06.620
Allegra and Ted head back to the motel, and
they finally plug back into Allegra’s game

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:07.620
pod.

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:10.419
Almost instantly, they’re transported into
Existenz.

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:14.630
Ted is in awe, being inside a virtual reality
game for the first time.

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:18.210
Ted asks how they’re supposed to play and
what the objectives are, but Allegra tells

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:20.259
him they have to play the game to find out.

00:06:20.259 --> 00:06:24.699
They look around and find a smaller version
of the game pod, a micro pod.

00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:30.460
A store owner, Nader, tells them the micro
pod is a brand new gaming architecture from

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:34.050
Cortical Systematics, Antenna’s equivalent
in-game.

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:38.240
They follow Nader to a secluded area, and
Ted suddenly gets intimidating and is taken

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.610
aback by his sudden urge to be mean.

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:43.949
Allegra tells him it’s part of the game
as the game would sometimes make them do or

00:06:43.949 --> 00:06:46.610
say things their characters are supposed to.

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:50.390
Ted continues, and Nader recommends they use
the micro pods.

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:54.789
Nader leaves, and Allegra comments that Nader’s
interactions are a little lacking, making

00:06:54.789 --> 00:06:56.699
a note to rework him.

00:06:56.699 --> 00:07:01.600
They use the micro pods, and as Ted inserts
the micro pod into Allegra, he kisses Allegra’s

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:02.669
bio port.

00:07:02.669 --> 00:07:06.919
Allegra pushes him back, and Ted says it wasn’t
him but his game character.

00:07:06.919 --> 00:07:09.960
Allegra then kisses Ted, and the two start
making out.

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:13.360
Allegra assumes it must be part of their character’s
stories.

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:16.419
Ted tries to stop, worried about his physical
body.

00:07:16.419 --> 00:07:19.880
Allegra assures him that their bodies are
fine, and they’d get pulled out of the game

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:22.039
if anything were to go wrong.

00:07:22.039 --> 00:07:26.259
They continue kissing, and Ted suddenly finds
himself in a filthy warehouse filled with

00:07:26.259 --> 00:07:31.380
bloody conveyor belts, workers lined on all
sides busy disemboweling mutated amphibians.

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:37.920
A game character, Nourish, tells Ted they’re
at a trout farm, farming all kinds of creatures

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:40.550
and creating parts for game pods.

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:44.080
Ted slices an amphibian open and starts separating
its guts.

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:48.270
Even he is surprised at the level of skill
mastery he has and assumes it’s his character’s

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:49.270
skills.

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:52.669
Nourish then recommends Ted have lunch at
a Chinese restaurant nearby and order the

00:07:52.669 --> 00:07:53.690
special.

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:55.990
Ted agrees and heads down to look for Allegra.

00:07:55.990 --> 00:08:01.060
He finds Allegra and commends her game design,
saying the factory looks dirty and grotesque,

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:03.570
looking as close to the real thing as possible.

00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:07.349
They head into the Chinese restaurant and
tell the waiter they want the special.

00:08:07.349 --> 00:08:12.090
Ted tells Allegra he wants to pause the game,
but Allegra is surprised, asking Ted if he’s

00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:14.819
not curious to find out more about the special.

00:08:14.819 --> 00:08:18.960
Ted says he’s afraid he might lose touch
with reality, but Allegra says this is only

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:22.080
an effect of how well the game integrates
with his brain.

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:26.250
Ted suddenly stands up, shouts pause, and
exits the game.

00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:30.900
They both awaken at the motel, and Allegra
says she wants to go back into the game immediately,

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:32.919
where there is intrigue and suspense.

00:08:32.919 --> 00:08:37.019
Ted is terrified, saying the reality they
returned to is indistinguishable from the

00:08:37.019 --> 00:08:41.179
game world, making him wonder if they’re
still inside a game without knowing.

00:08:41.179 --> 00:08:46.470
Allegra kisses Ted, reassuring him that she’s
real, and they agree to go back into the game.

00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:51.180
The waiter returns, bringing the special,
a large plate filled with all sorts of amphibians

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:53.829
and reptiles, all mixed in a soup.

00:08:53.829 --> 00:08:57.279
Ted sees the two-headed creature they saw
in the real world and gets the sudden urge

00:08:57.279 --> 00:08:59.269
to eat everything on the plate.

00:08:59.269 --> 00:09:04.759
Both are disgusted, but Ted, unable to control
his actions, continues eating happily.

00:09:04.759 --> 00:09:08.589
He eats the flesh and skin off of the amphibians,
leaving the bones.

00:09:08.589 --> 00:09:12.959
He starts assembling the bones, clicking them
together until he forms the same bone pistol

00:09:12.959 --> 00:09:15.040
they found on Allegra’s assailant.

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:19.160
Ted takes a tooth bridge from his mouth and
places it in as the gun’s ammunition.

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:22.600
He suddenly aims the weapon at Allegra’s
head, looking as if he’s ready to pull the

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:25.100
trigger, proclaiming death to the demoness.

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:29.579
He stops himself, and Allegra passes it off
as a joke but is visibly shaken.

00:09:29.579 --> 00:09:34.079
Ted apologizes and admits he has the urge
to kill someone, pointing to the waiter.

00:09:34.079 --> 00:09:36.999
The waiter approaches their table, and Ted
shoots.

00:09:36.999 --> 00:09:42.040
The waiter tries to fight back, but Ted fires
again, destroying half of the man’s face.

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:45.689
Everyone in the restaurant is stunned, but
Ted assures them everything is fine and tells

00:09:45.689 --> 00:09:47.579
them to continue their meals.

00:09:47.579 --> 00:09:50.820
The crowd complies and continues their lunches
as if nothing happened.

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:54.550
A dog picks up the bone gun and carries it
away.

00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:57.290
Nourish appears and gestures for them to follow.

00:09:57.290 --> 00:10:01.040
Nourish congratulates them for killing the
waiter, revealing that the waiter was a spy

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:03.060
for Cortical Systematics.

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:07.129
Nourish then tells them he’s part of an
underground organization called the Realists,

00:10:07.129 --> 00:10:11.290
a group dedicated to destroying Cortical Systematics
for the crimes they’ve committed against

00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:12.290
reality.

00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:15.889
He then tells them they must continue working
in the company as they need more agents on

00:10:15.889 --> 00:10:16.910
the inside.

00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:23.459
Ted and Allegra return to the game store looking
for Nader, but a different man, Hugo, is operating

00:10:23.459 --> 00:10:24.949
the cash register.

00:10:24.949 --> 00:10:27.790
Hugo leads them back, showing a dead Nader.

00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:31.519
Hugo shows them the bone gun that the Chinese
waiter’s dog had brought him.

00:10:31.519 --> 00:10:36.029
He reveals that the Chinese waiter was a Realist
member, and Nourish and Nader are the spies

00:10:36.029 --> 00:10:38.029
working for Cortical Systems.

00:10:38.029 --> 00:10:42.019
Nader had known about Ted and Allegra’s
arrival and had successfully gotten them to

00:10:42.019 --> 00:10:45.329
assassinate their supposed contact to the
Realist movement.

00:10:45.329 --> 00:10:49.410
Hugo then tasks them to head back to the factory
to eliminate Nourish.

00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:53.689
They return to the trout farm and find a mangled
rotting game pod, and Allegra says she has

00:10:53.689 --> 00:10:55.639
the urge to plug herself in.

00:10:55.639 --> 00:11:00.860
Ted warns the pod looks diseased, but Allegra
dismisses him, plugging the pod into her.

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:04.040
She turns the pod on and suddenly starts feeling
pain.

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:07.399
Ted cuts the umbilical cord, and Allegra starts
bleeding out.

00:11:07.399 --> 00:11:12.660
Nourish steps in with a flamethrower and burns
the diseased pod, proclaiming death to realism.

00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:16.880
The pod bursts open, and a massive amount
of spores fill the air, infecting all the

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:19.029
game pod parts in the factory.

00:11:19.029 --> 00:11:23.179
Allegra then stabs Nourish, and Nourish declares
death to the demoness before falling.

00:11:23.179 --> 00:11:27.879
The flamethrower starts burning the building,
and Ted and Allegra wake up safely back at

00:11:27.879 --> 00:11:29.279
the motel.

00:11:29.279 --> 00:11:32.899
Allegra says they’ve somehow brought the
disease back with them from Existenz, and

00:11:32.899 --> 00:11:35.019
it has now infected her game pod.

00:11:35.019 --> 00:11:40.149
Allegra tries remedying it by injecting medicine
and notices Ted scratching his bio port.

00:11:40.149 --> 00:11:44.170
She examines Ted’s bio port and realizes
this is Kiri’s doing.

00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:48.459
Allegra surmises Kiri must have given Ted
an infected bio port, knowing Ted would plug

00:11:48.459 --> 00:11:50.540
into Allegra’s pod, infecting it.

00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:55.639
Ted starts panicking, knowing he has an infected
bio port, but Allegra takes action, inserting

00:11:55.639 --> 00:11:58.689
a plug into Ted’s bio port to stop the infection.

00:11:58.689 --> 00:12:04.189
An explosion occurs, and Hugo from the game
appears sporting camo pants and a firearm.

00:12:04.189 --> 00:12:08.600
Hugo shoots the pod, and Ted tells Allegra
he thinks they’re still in the game.

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:12.699
They all rush out into a warzone with explosions
and gunfire everywhere.

00:12:12.699 --> 00:12:17.799
Hugo tells them this is the Realist uprising,
and they are here to stop Existenz and Antenna.

00:12:17.799 --> 00:12:21.009
Hugo aims the gun at Allegra, but Kiri shoots
him.

00:12:21.009 --> 00:12:25.339
Ted and Allegra are in utter confusion, unsure
if they’ve exited the game or are still

00:12:25.339 --> 00:12:26.339
inside.

00:12:26.339 --> 00:12:30.660
Kiri runs to them with the bone gun in hand
and tells them he made a copy of the game.

00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:32.670
He had replicated it during the surgery.

00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:36.920
He then tells Allegra to join him in defecting
to Cortical Systematics, joining others from

00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:40.799
Antenna, but Allegra picks up Hugo’s gun
and shoots Kiri.

00:12:40.799 --> 00:12:45.899
Ted gets angry, taking the gun from Allegra,
but Allegra tells him Kiri was only a game

00:12:45.899 --> 00:12:48.149
character, and she didn’t like how he was
confusing her.

00:12:48.149 --> 00:12:52.160
But Ted is concerned that they might no longer
be in the game, and Allegra may have killed

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:53.819
Kiri in real life.

00:12:53.819 --> 00:12:58.050
Ted then points the gun at Allegra, telling
her that their ending up together was no accident.

00:12:58.050 --> 00:13:02.490
Allegra realizes Ted is part of the Realist
movement all along, remembering how he didn’t

00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:04.470
have a bio port installed.

00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:09.299
Ted confirms this, saying he only got the
bio port to get closer to Allegra, to understand

00:13:09.299 --> 00:13:11.069
the person he intended to kill.

00:13:11.069 --> 00:13:14.709
Allegra then reveals she had suspected Ted
to be her true assassin when he aimed the

00:13:14.709 --> 00:13:16.730
bone gun at her back at the restaurant.

00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:21.550
The plug she inserted in his bio port is a
bomb, and she detonates it, blowing up Ted’s

00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:22.550
spine.

00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:24.899
Allegra celebrates, saying she’s won the
game.

00:13:24.899 --> 00:13:29.220
Attachments suddenly appear on her head and
hand, and before she knows it, she awakens

00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:32.519
back at the church with a group of volunteers.

00:13:32.519 --> 00:13:38.049
Characters in the game like the waiter, Kiri,
Nader, Gas, Hugo, and Nourish are all present

00:13:38.049 --> 00:13:39.269
as volunteers.

00:13:39.269 --> 00:13:43.639
Nourish is revealed to be the game’s designer,
and Ted and Allegra are audience members who

00:13:43.639 --> 00:13:45.459
are also volunteers.

00:13:45.459 --> 00:13:51.100
The volunteers then share comments, criticisms,
and ideas about the game, Trancendenz.

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:55.529
Some give praise, others recall funny moments
and laugh, and others express their excitement

00:13:55.529 --> 00:13:57.170
for the game’s development.

00:13:57.170 --> 00:14:01.209
The volunteers all applaud Nourish and Nourish
and his assistant step aside to talk about

00:14:01.209 --> 00:14:02.230
the game.

00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:06.160
Nourish expresses his concern that he’s
terrified of the game they just played, having

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:10.819
concepts like assassinating a famous game
designer, obviously a reference to him.

00:14:10.819 --> 00:14:15.029
Nourish suspects that the game may have picked
up some of the volunteer’s inner thoughts,

00:14:15.029 --> 00:14:17.389
thinking that one of them could want him dead.

00:14:17.389 --> 00:14:21.480
Ted and Allegra take their dog and approach
Nourish, telling Nourish his game design is

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:25.949
nothing like they’ve ever seen before, concluding
that Nourish is indeed the greatest game designer

00:14:25.949 --> 00:14:27.239
in the world.

00:14:27.239 --> 00:14:30.930
Ted then congratulates Nourish for being reality’s
greatest enemy.

00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:34.899
Ted and Allegra take guns out concealed on
the dog and start firing at Nourish and the

00:14:34.899 --> 00:14:35.949
assistant.

00:14:35.949 --> 00:14:39.899
They fall to the floor, and Ted and Allegra
shout death to the demon Nourish and death

00:14:39.899 --> 00:14:41.800
to Trancendenz.

00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:45.819
They then make their way to the door, aiming
their guns at the man who played the waiter.

00:14:45.819 --> 00:14:49.189
He begs them not to shoot then asks if they’re
still playing a game.

00:14:49.189 --> 00:15:01.419
Ted and Allegra stare at him, puzzled, but
don’t answer.
