00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.750
A disable young lady manages to crawl all
the way out of a junkyard.

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:07.509
Just then, she finds a skateboard nearby.

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:11.530
While the crows are gathering around an arid
desert, the girl attempts to move along on

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:12.680
a skateboard.

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.460
Her fate is now unsure.

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.129
Would she make it to survive?

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:18.640
Follow us to a movie titled: The Bad Batch.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.449
Be aware: there are spoilers!

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.909
In the post-apocalyptic world, Arlen is tossed
to a wasteland beyond the US border.

00:00:25.909 --> 00:00:28.980
It’s a desert with little shelter from the
sun.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.730
She is provided a bag, a basketball hat, a
burger, and a can of water as the last favor

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:34.920
from the government.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.690
She has to reach the Comfort, a town where
she can seek refuge.

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.510
On the way, she finds an abandoned car and
decides to get in for a rest.

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.800
Realizing strange people approach, she runs
as fast as she can.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.800
Unfortunately, a strong man hunts her down
just after.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.550
Waking up from the blackout, Arlen finds herself
being chained.

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.510
A woman appears and injects her with some
desensitizer.

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.990
Just then, she cuts Arlen’s arm and leg
with a hand saw.

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:04.820
Arlen cries out in pain and passes out again.

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.510
It turns out Arlen is captured by a cannibal
tribe called the Bridge.

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:13.189
They make a living from the leftovers left
in the junkyards and hunt humans for food.

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:17.719
To survive in the harsh desert, women and
men have to be strong and well built.

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:19.659
Their leader is Miami Man.

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:23.430
At night, Arlen gains awareness and realizes
her limbs are gone.

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.799
She then thinks of a plan to escape from the
hunters.

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:30.210
The next morning, the chef woman sees Arlen
in her own waste.

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.360
She is then unchained for cleaning up.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.569
While the woman doesn’t notice, Arlen kills
her with an iron bar.

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:38.350
Next, she crawls away and finds a skateboard.

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.570
She eventually escapes and makes her way to
the Comfort as planned.

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.610
As she encounters heatstroke, a mute man rescues
and later brings her right to the Comfort.

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.819
Strange enough, the man just leaves when Arlen
is surrounded by people from the town.

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:54.969
Five months later, Arlen starts to get used
to her life in Comfort.

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:57.509
She is given a prosthetic leg and a house.

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.079
Arlen still fantasizes about her body with
a normal arm.

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.429
She decides to take revenge on those who cut
her arm and leg.

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:06.880
Arlen walks out of the Comfort with a pistol.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.349
Meanwhile, Miami Man’s wife and daughter
are on their way to seek for food and necessity

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:12.590
as usual.

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.540
The wife accidentally cuts her leg in the
landfill.

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.900
Arlen realizes that the two are from the cannibal
Bridge.

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.790
She then accuses the woman for her loss and
bloody shoots her in the head.

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.569
The little girl shakes her mother but she’s
dead.

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:29.599
Later, the mute man notices that Arlen is
on her way back to the Comfort, followed by

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:30.810
the little girl.

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.400
As feeling sorry, Arlen then buys the girl
a pet rabbit.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.980
The girl doesn’t want to talk to Arlen but
she attachs to the bunny.

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.110
Elsewhere, Miami Man begins looking for his
wife and daughter around the desert.

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.659
He finds his wife’s corpse at a party for
the crows.

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:48.900
Miami Man then sees the mute man and asks
him for information.

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:54.750
The man requires Miami Man to draw him a portrait
in exchange for his daughter’s location.

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.319
Pleased with the result, the mute man then
writes Miami Man to find his girl in Comfort.

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:03.530
At night, the girl follows Arlen to hang out
around the town.

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.049
Although born and raised in the cannibal tribe,
the girl gets scared seeing a bunny get killed

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:09.049
for food.

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:13.219
Tonight, the folks are gathering to see The
Dream - the Comfort’s leader.

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:17.610
The Dream holds a party with DJ Jimmy and
bright neon lights against the desert sky.

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.650
He gives his residents hallucinatory drugs
to enter their own dreams and forget about

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.170
their struggling lives.

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.390
As the bunny runs away, the little girl chases
after and sees The Dream.

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.170
He takes her inside with one of his pregnant
wives.

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:35.050
In hallucination, Arlen knows that she has
lost the girl, but her body can’t follow

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:36.769
her logical thinking.

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:40.989
She wonders the value of living in Comfort
while wandering to look for the girl.

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:43.580
Arlen then leaves Comfort alone in the night.

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:48.719
While getting high and enjoying the starry
sky, Arlen runs into Miami Man, who is looking

00:03:48.719 --> 00:03:50.189
for his missing daughter.

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:53.390
She doesn't know why there is a big man standing
in front of her.

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.459
Arlen just rests her head on his chest after
that.

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:01.840
The following morning, Arlen wakes up and
her artificial leg is missing . Miami Man

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.569
didn’t kill her last night for food as usual
because he knows Arlen is from the Comfort.

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:11.170
He confronts her about his missing girl while
threatening to destroy her leg.

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:15.349
Realizing the danger from the canninal Bridge,
Arlen lies that she can help Miami Man to

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:17.250
find his daughter in Comfort.

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.790
Miami threatens Arlen that if she can’t
find her, he’ll kill her at all cost.

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:25.580
While the two are returning to the Comfort,
a man riding a bike approaches.

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:29.410
He wants to trade gasoline for flesh which
is a leg from Arlen.

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.440
Miami Man accepts right away.

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.210
Arlen is then carried away on the man’s
shoulder.

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:38.040
Just then, Miami Man turns his back and attacks
the man with his knife.

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.340
He chops one arm saving for food.

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.490
Miami Man steals the man’s scooter and drives
off with Arlen.

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:48.330
On the way, the two stop by a bush so Arlen
can go to the toilet.

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.760
There is suddenly a wind storm raging on.

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.090
Miami Man covers Arlen with a piece of cloth.

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:57.860
This time, something sparks between them,
but they never say it out loud.

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.010
At night, Miami Man grills the arm for dinner.

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:03.870
Arlen asks why he ended up being exiled.

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:08.030
Miami Man reveals that he is a Cuban and immigrated
to the US illegally.

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:11.410
He even draws Cuba’s location to show Arlen.

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:14.460
She gets closer and shows him some of her
tattoos.

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:18.300
She suddenly steals a knife from Miami and
points at him for defense.

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:22.710
Miami Man challenges her to stab him in the
stomach but Arlen seems reluctant.

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:26.770
All of a sudden, he gets shot from nowhere
in the chest right after that.

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:29.599
A man appears and points the gun at Miami
Man.

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:33.160
He urges Arlen to follow and assures that
she’ll be safe with him.

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.280
It turns out he’s from the Comfort.

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.289
Arlen returns home that night.

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:41.330
Strangely, she doesn’t feel alright about
being rescued.

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.949
The following day, she becomes deep in thoughts
about Miami Man.

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:48.169
She decides to step out of Comfort and looks
for him.

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:52.419
Arriving at the fire last night, she only
sees his blood on the ground and his drawing

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:53.690
notebook left.

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:56.770
Elsewhere, the mute man sees some crows landing.

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:59.169
He then finds Miami Man lying on the ground.

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:01.320
Luckily, he is still alive.

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:04.070
The mute man traps a crow with his shirt.

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:07.550
At night, he uses the crow for food and nurses
Mimami.

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:12.129
The wounded man finds the animal meat tasteless
but he still takes it from the mute man.

00:06:12.129 --> 00:06:16.490
Meanwhile, Arlen flips over the drawing notes
and decides to help Miami Man to find his

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:17.669
daughter.

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:21.860
After a long day, Arlen comes across the girl
following The Dream’s wives.

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:25.240
It turns out the girl is living with The Dream
in his palace.

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:28.370
During this time, Miami Man is fully recovered.

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:32.680
He receives the knife from the mute man and
continues searching for his young girl.

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:38.139
Before leaving, the mute man gives him a snow
globe and trades it with Miami’s hunt knife.

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:41.889
Back to Comfort, Arlen decides to show up
at The Dream’s door.

00:06:41.889 --> 00:06:47.020
Entering his palace, she finds many young
pregnant women making some drugs and marijuana.

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:51.349
The Dream arrives and lets her know that the
Comfort’s economy runs on these drugs.

00:06:51.349 --> 00:06:55.800
The man then invites Arlen a drink but she
just holds it for politeness, knowing that

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:57.259
the drink is drugged

00:06:57.259 --> 00:07:01.110
While talking, The Dream knows that Arlen
doesn’t like to live in Comfort for the

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:02.319
past months.

00:07:02.319 --> 00:07:07.000
He states that if it is not Comfort, Arlen
will be eaten out there in the desert.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.699
Arlen says that she wants to be one of his
ladies, attempting to get closer to him.

00:07:11.699 --> 00:07:15.520
As expected, The Dream orders a woman to prepare
a room for Arlen.

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:19.039
Later, a young pregnant woman takes care of
Arlen.

00:07:19.039 --> 00:07:23.919
In the toilet, Arlen draws a pistol that she
hid under the prosthetic leg before.

00:07:23.919 --> 00:07:26.919
She points the gun at the woman and uses her
as a hostage.

00:07:26.919 --> 00:07:31.250
Eventually, The Dream has to release Miami’s
daughter for the safety of his wife.

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:34.009
Arlen drives off with the little girl and
her bunny.

00:07:34.009 --> 00:07:37.389
The Dream and the residents do not accept
her in Comfort anymore.

00:07:37.389 --> 00:07:40.820
Arlen is fine with it as she has been longing
to leave Comfort.

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:44.169
She thinks it is just not right to live in
lies and drugs.

00:07:44.169 --> 00:07:48.300
She understands that the outside world is
dangerous but she rather fends for herself.

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:51.889
On the way, Arlen sees a vehicle coming.

00:07:51.889 --> 00:07:53.759
This time, she doesn’t run away.

00:07:53.759 --> 00:07:57.570
She holds the pistol and gets ready to fight
for whoever it is.

00:07:57.570 --> 00:07:59.610
It turns out to be Miami Man.

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:02.909
The daughter and father reunite after days
apart.

00:08:02.909 --> 00:08:06.789
Miami tells Arlen to leave and he won’t
hurt her as promised.

00:08:06.789 --> 00:08:10.879
Arlen says that she would never go back to
Comfort and wants to stay with him in the

00:08:10.879 --> 00:08:11.879
desert.

00:08:11.879 --> 00:08:16.569
Miami tries to dissuade her, believing that
she will not survive in the harsh desert.

00:08:16.569 --> 00:08:19.500
Arlen just holds his hand, attempting to be
with him.

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:23.860
The daughter asks for spaghetti as she is
already used to the food in the mansion.

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:28.790
Miami Man takes her pet rabbit as food, and
the three of them rest by the fire, eating

00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:29.790
it.

00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:34.050
Miami Man and Arlen look each other in the
eye and smile.
