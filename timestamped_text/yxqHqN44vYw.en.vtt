00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:02.830
Hi, Mystery Recapped here.

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:09.160
Today I’m going to explain the second part
of a drama mini series called “Click Bait,”

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:10.550
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:15.860
Watch out and take care!

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:20.320
After being found in Curtis’s house and
denying having any kind of relationship with

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.949
him, both Sophie and Curtis are brought to
the police station for questioning.

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:30.109
Sophie now sits in front of detective Luca
and Roshan and is being asked about her relationship

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:31.310
with Curtis.

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.260
She finally admits that she had an affair
with him six months ago.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.840
Her reason for visiting Curtis was to know
for sure if he killed her husband.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.740
Sophie also reveals that she initiated the
relationship with Curtis and ended it because

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.180
he had started to fall in love with her.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.220
Before she leaves, Roshan tells her that if
Curtis is really the culprit, she will have

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.280
to testify about her relationship publicly.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.310
Sophie then returns home to Pia, who informs
her that Nick’s workplace has organised

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:00.890
a memorial for him the following day.

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.720
The next morning, everyone is in the living
room when Ethan sees the video of Curtis being

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:06.720
arrested.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.810
Sophie tries to stop them from watching it,
but Pia insists they do.

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.710
Ethan recognises Curtis as his school teacher
but is confused why he would be arrested.

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.490
Pia realises that Curtis’s arrest has to
do something with Sophie.

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.170
She takes her aside and asks her if she was
at the police station last night.

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.990
It is finally revealed to Pia that Curtis
and Sophie were having an affair.

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.510
An enraged Pia reminds Sophie that if Curtis
is the one who killed Nick, it will all be

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:33.710
her fault.

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.740
As Pia barges out of the room, we see Ethan
has been listening to their conversation all

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:39.740
along.

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.869
Without saying anything, he takes his skateboard
and goes out, in spite of Sophie asking him

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:45.170
to stay home.

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.530
She goes out to look for him but is mobbed
by the reporters again.

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.869
She somehow manages to get past them and goes
to the park he usually skateboards in.

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:57.830
Sophie doesn’t find Ethan there, but she
notices a woman nearby watching her.

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.500
She had seen her earlier at their house as
well.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.670
Sophie calls the woman out for following her.

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.080
The nervous lady introduces herself as Emma
Beesly.

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.630
To Sophie’s disbelief, she claims to be
dating Nick before his death.

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.690
Emma explains that she is from LA, where Nick
used to travel frequently.

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:20.230
They met on a dating app called 2Smitten,
where Nick went by the name Danny Walters.

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.200
Sophie doesn’t buy into the woman’s bullshit
at first but begins to believe her when she

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.810
mentions they started talking in March, around
the time Nick found out about Sophie cheating

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:29.810
on him.

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.810
She curses at Emma, gets inside her car, and
breaks down crying.

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.040
Pia calls her, informing her that they have
found Ethan.

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.739
Sophie goes to them and asks Ethan to come
home with her.

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:42.380
She also tells Pia about her encounter with
Emma.

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:47.360
Pia looks for the 2Smitten app on her phone
and finds a deactivated profile by the name

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.750
Danny Walters.

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.370
She assures Sophie that she will find out
if Emma’s story is true.

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.530
Then, Pia contacts her computer genius friend
Vince and asks him to find out about Danny

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:58.530
Walters.

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.020
Later, the TV shows the news of Curtis being
arrested.

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.030
People start to conspire about Curtis’s
relationship with Sophie, and rumours about

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.310
their affair start going around.

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.110
Sophie asks her family to turn the TV off
and leave for Nick’s workplace for the memorial.

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.500
There, Sophie is approached by one of Nick’s
students, Jenny, who vaguely tells her that

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.870
Nick was close to a girl in the basketball
team before Matt intervenes and takes Sophie

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:22.870
away.

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.400
The memorial starts, and Matt gives a speech.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.769
Sophie gets overwhelmed and walks out.

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:32.260
On her way out, a woman insults her, resulting
in Sophie throwing a glass of water to her

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:33.260
face.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.819
She immediately regrets it and cries as the
others escort her out.

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:41.470
At night, Pia shows her the pictures from
Danny's deactivated profile and confirms that

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.490
it was, in fact, Nick’s.

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:46.060
He had been cheating on Sophie for two years.

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.129
A heartbroken Sophie cries while holding her
husband’s picture.

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:54.060
In the following scene, we are shown Emma
and Nick together on a bed.

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:59.500
Few days before his disappearance, she received
flowers and balloons from Nick while at work.

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.650
The day he disappeared, she found out while
she was at the gym.

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.890
Emma already knew Nick was married, but he
had promised to divorce Sophie after Ethan

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:08.379
graduated high school.

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:12.780
Emma followed Nick’s case closely and wanted
to be around people he knew to grieve his

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:13.780
death.

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:14.790
So, she flew to Oakland.

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:20.090
Strangely, though, she claimed to be Nick’s
fiance to get a bereavement discount for the

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:21.090
flight.

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.440
That day, when she met Sophie, she had come
to her home to tell her about the affair.

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.930
While waiting outside Sophie’s house, a
reporter named Ben Park gives her his card,

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:32.400
assuming she is a reporter as well.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.220
After her encounter with Sophie, Emma comes
back to her hotel room and hallucinates Nick

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:38.940
sitting beside her on the bed.

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.370
Emma seems to be losing her mind over him.

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.430
The next day, she meets detective Roshan and
tells him whatever she knows about Nick in

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.160
hopes of helping the case.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.900
She then goes to Nick’s work and happens
to meet Matt.

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.870
She tells him she is just one of Nick’s
friends.

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:56.990
After that, Emma sneaks into Nick’s office
and is found by his co-worker Dawn.

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:01.490
Dawn makes the woman leave, and at the same
time, Pia arrives at the place.

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:05.690
She meets Matt and asks him if he knew about
Nick’s affair since he accompanied Nick

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:08.000
to his LA trip several times.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.120
However, Matt seems to know nothing about
the matter.

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:15.680
Meanwhile, at home, Sophie is looking at casket
options for Nick when she gets a message from

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.000
an unknown number calling her names.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.440
Soon, she begins receiving several such messages.

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.000
Someone had leaked her phone number and credit
card details online.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.270
Then, Pia goes to meet Emma in her hotel room.

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:31.220
Emma is surprised but happy to see Nick’s
sister.

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:33.930
Pia asks her if whatever she is saying is
true.

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:38.169
Instead of answering, Emma says that Nick
told her about his and Pia’s relationship.

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:41.730
She knows that they went through some stuff
together as kids that brought them closer

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:42.820
than ever.

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:47.150
Hearing this, Pia believes that Emma was,
in fact in contact with Nick.

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:50.600
She gives Emma her number for any emergencies
and leaves.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:55.259
At night when everyone is at home, Sophie’s
mother Ruby and Nick’s mother Andrea get

00:05:55.259 --> 00:05:58.770
into an argument after Andrea insults Sophie
for cheating.

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:01.470
The situation in the family is grim.

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:06.100
At the same time, Emma receives a call from
a man who threatens her to go back to LA as

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:09.100
soon as possible, leaving Nick’s family
behind.

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:13.210
Emma freaks out after the call and drives
away from the hotel in her car.

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:16.050
She calls Pia in panic and leaves her a voicemail.

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:18.790
Soon, she realises that she is being followed.

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:21.800
The car swerves, crashing her car off the
road.

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:25.520
Later, Emma is in the hospital talking to
Roshan about the encounter.

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:29.320
Roshan now believes that Nick’s murder has
to do something with Emma, and the person

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.470
who called her was probably the perpetrator.

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:34.510
Pia arrives at the hospital and listens to
Emma’s story.

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:39.110
When Pia and Roshan are alone, Roshan informs
her that they have found three other dating

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:41.100
profiles that were Nick’s.

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:44.940
The pattern shows that he created profiles
on different sights and talked to a different

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:46.930
girl in all of them.

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:49.670
Eventually, after they broke up, he deleted
the profiles.

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:54.160
Pia lays on this information to Emma, thinking
she deserves to know it.

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:59.130
She also reveals that one of the girls Nick
talked to is named Mandy Harrison, an artist

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:00.460
based in LA.

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:04.699
When Emma returns back to LA, she looks for
Mandy’s socials and asks her to meet.

00:07:04.699 --> 00:07:08.759
The two talk to each other and find out that
Nick had said the exact same thing to them.

00:07:08.759 --> 00:07:13.550
But Mandy had looked through his lies and
broken up with him while Emma believed him.

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:16.710
Mandy had also made a painting of Nick, which
Emma buys from her.

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:20.300
She feels betrayed by Nick and burns the painting
in frustration.

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:25.259
She also calls the reporter Ben Park and agrees
to do an interview with him as Nick’s girlfriend

00:07:25.259 --> 00:07:26.770
outside marriage.

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:31.229
In the interview, she suggests that Nick abused
her emotionally, so the things written on

00:07:31.229 --> 00:07:33.360
the cards might just be true.

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:38.070
If the interview is broadcasted, Nick’s
reputation will go downhill quickly.

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:41.759
Ben is overjoyed to be able to land such an
important interview.

00:07:41.759 --> 00:07:45.830
His boss asks him to find out about other
women who were involved with Nick online.

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:50.419
Later, Ben gets an idea to visit the Brewers’
home to tell them about Emma’s interview

00:07:50.419 --> 00:07:55.039
and manipulate Sophie into giving an interview
in order to save Ben’s reputation.

00:07:55.039 --> 00:07:59.349
He poses as a deliveryman and enters the house
while recording with his phone.

00:07:59.349 --> 00:08:02.630
Pia soon finds him and threatens to call the
police.

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:06.290
He tells them about Emma’s interview and
leaves his card on the floor for them to contact

00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:07.290
him.

00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:10.139
Later, Ben is at his home with his boyfriend,
Cameron.

00:08:10.139 --> 00:08:14.569
He goes into several dating apps to look for
more of Nick’s profiles, if there are any.

00:08:14.569 --> 00:08:16.889
Cameron helps him to search for the profiles.

00:08:16.889 --> 00:08:21.610
Meanwhile, Pia calls Roshan home and tells
him about Emma’s interview, only to be told

00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:25.470
that the police cannot do anything because
Emma didn’t break the law by talking to

00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:26.639
the reporters.

00:08:26.639 --> 00:08:30.880
In fact, since the perpetrator doesn’t want
Emma to come forward with her story, the interview

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:33.699
might help them catch him in case he makes
a wrong move.

00:08:33.699 --> 00:08:38.479
Pia is angered to know that the police are
treating her brother’s reputation as collateral

00:08:38.479 --> 00:08:39.479
damage.

00:08:39.479 --> 00:08:43.659
At night, Ben is on the internet, looking
up comments on Nick’s posts.

00:08:43.659 --> 00:08:46.230
One comment, in particular, catches his attention.

00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:50.819
The comment is written by a girl named Jenny,
who approached Sophie during the memorial.

00:08:50.819 --> 00:08:54.910
She fights the people who defend Nick, calling
his supporters losers.

00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:59.529
The very next day, Ben goes to meet her and
asks her if she had a feud with Nick.

00:08:59.529 --> 00:09:03.939
Jenny hesitantly tells him to talk to another
team member named Tara Wilson.

00:09:03.939 --> 00:09:08.100
Jenny had heard Nick fighting with Tara over
something a while back.

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:13.040
After talking to Jenny, Ben goes to a restaurant
where Tara waitresses and asks her about Ben.

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:16.800
However, Tara dismisses them, saying that
it is nothing important.

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:20.800
When Ben returns to the office later, he is
surprised to find out that Sophie has agreed

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:24.949
to do an interview with them before they broadcast
Emma’s interview, so the narrative could

00:09:24.949 --> 00:09:26.040
change a little.

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:30.679
However, Ben’s boss removes him from the
case for trespassing the Brewers’ home and

00:09:30.679 --> 00:09:33.579
puts another employee in for the interview.

00:09:33.579 --> 00:09:38.119
Distressed at the fact, Ben returns home only
to find that Cameron has somehow managed to

00:09:38.119 --> 00:09:41.949
find one of Nick’s dating profiles that
had been unknown until then.

00:09:41.949 --> 00:09:44.920
Nick’s name is Jeremy Wilkerson in the app.

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:48.759
They have the profile, but they have to gain
access to it somehow.

00:09:48.759 --> 00:09:51.760
Cameron suggests they pay someone to hack
it on the dark web.

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:55.689
The two manage to get access to his personal
information, including the number of messages

00:09:55.689 --> 00:09:57.100
he has sent to women.

00:09:57.100 --> 00:10:02.220
They see that most messages have been sent
to a woman named Maggie Oxley from Sacramento.

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:06.029
While trying to look for the girl online,
they do not find her socials, but they are

00:10:06.029 --> 00:10:09.000
able to find a bookstore on her profile picture.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.899
Without wasting much time, the two drive to
Sacramento the following day.

00:10:12.899 --> 00:10:16.470
The bookstore manager reveals that Maggie
is actually a cat.

00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:20.459
When shown the picture from the profile, he
recognises the woman as Sarah Burton, a woman

00:10:20.459 --> 00:10:22.660
who killed herself four months ago.

00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:24.630
The couple is shocked to hear the information.

00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:28.889
They go through Sarah’s socials and find
out where her brother Simon lives.

00:10:28.889 --> 00:10:33.139
Cameron suggests they just hand the information
to the police, but Ben is excited to do the

00:10:33.139 --> 00:10:34.699
research on his own.

00:10:34.699 --> 00:10:38.889
Cameron is still sceptical about the plan
but drives Ben to Simon’s house anyway.

00:10:38.889 --> 00:10:42.259
He stays outside in the car as Ben goes in
to talk to him.

00:10:42.259 --> 00:10:45.389
Ben knocks on the apartment door, but no one
answers.

00:10:45.389 --> 00:10:48.889
But he doesn't give up and looks under the
doormat to find a key.

00:10:48.889 --> 00:10:53.509
He sneaks into Simon’s apartment and snoops
around for any clue that relates to Sarah.

00:10:53.509 --> 00:10:57.759
He finds a box under the bed which has Sarah’s
stuff inside, including her phone.

00:10:57.759 --> 00:11:02.360
Meanwhile, Cameron sees Simon getting inside
the apartment building and calls Ben to alert

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:03.360
him.

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:07.569
Simon comes inside the apartment and starts
to smoke as Ben sneaks out behind him.

00:11:07.569 --> 00:11:10.019
Cameron hears the noise and chases after Ben.

00:11:10.019 --> 00:11:13.679
But Ben and Cameron manage to get away before
the man can catch them.

00:11:13.679 --> 00:11:18.610
Cameron is furious at Ben for treating the
case as a game and doing illegal things, so

00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:21.079
Ben doesn’t tell him about the phone he
stole.

00:11:21.079 --> 00:11:25.319
At night, Ben retrieves data from Sarah’s
phone and successfully finds the messages

00:11:25.319 --> 00:11:26.899
between her and Nick.

00:11:26.899 --> 00:11:30.480
In the messages, Sarah seems to be in a severely
bad mental condition.

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:35.630
She even threatens Nick that she will kill
herself, but Nick is nonchalant to her problems.

00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:39.049
Ben realises that Sarah killed herself because
of Nick.

00:11:39.049 --> 00:11:43.239
The following day, he brings all the evidence
to his boss and asks her to let him interview

00:11:43.239 --> 00:11:44.239
Sophie.

00:11:44.239 --> 00:11:46.589
Meanwhile, Sophie is nervous about the interview.

00:11:46.589 --> 00:11:49.579
Pia comforts her and tells her that it will
be fine.

00:11:49.579 --> 00:11:53.730
Sophie’s attorney helps her with the answers
to the questions she will potentially be asked

00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:55.459
while they drive to the interview.

00:11:55.459 --> 00:11:58.519
At the same time, Ben is also preparing for
it.

00:11:58.519 --> 00:12:01.319
For the first few minutes, the interview goes
as planned.

00:12:01.319 --> 00:12:05.489
Ben asks her several questions about her affair
and Nick’s character, and Sophie answers

00:12:05.489 --> 00:12:06.559
them all truthfully.

00:12:06.559 --> 00:12:10.389
Then, he mentions Sarah’s death which throws
Sophie off guard.

00:12:10.389 --> 00:12:13.749
She claims that she doesn’t know what he
is talking about, but Ben shows her the final

00:12:13.749 --> 00:12:18.139
conversations between Nick and Sarah, which
prompted Sarah to commit suicide.

00:12:18.139 --> 00:12:21.929
Sophie panics and walks out of the interview
giving the people more to talk about.

00:12:21.929 --> 00:12:25.690
Later, they are at home when the interview
is aired on television.

00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:30.540
The last few messages between Nick and Sarah
are even enacted as a phone call to make it

00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:32.119
seem more personal.

00:12:32.119 --> 00:12:35.560
The detectives are furious as to how they
didn’t know about Sarah.

00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:38.920
Sarah’s brother Simon also watches the interview
in anger.

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:41.230
The scene then changes to six months earlier.

00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:45.850
Simon, who works for a tech company, sees
his sister swooning over a man she is dating

00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:46.850
online.

00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:50.679
He asks her to be careful at first but then
approves of their relationship after seeing

00:12:50.679 --> 00:12:52.730
how happy the guy makes her.

00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:57.189
She had been suicidal for a very long time,
but after talking to Jeremy, she has started

00:12:57.189 --> 00:12:59.110
doing the things she enjoys again.

00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:03.239
However, when Simon visits her some weeks
later, she is in the worst mental condition

00:13:03.239 --> 00:13:04.569
she has ever been in.

00:13:04.569 --> 00:13:08.819
Simon asks her why she hasn't been to work
for over a week when she reveals that Jeremy

00:13:08.819 --> 00:13:10.829
is actually married to someone.

00:13:10.829 --> 00:13:14.860
She breaks down crying, saying that she doesn’t
want to live anymore while Simon comforts

00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:15.860
her.

00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:20.600
A few days later, Simon is with his friend
Darryl at work when he gets a call from Sarah.

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:23.410
She cries hysterically while apologising to
him.

00:13:23.410 --> 00:13:28.040
Simon figures out something is terribly wrong
and runs to her apartment, only to find her

00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:29.040
dead.

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:32.639
Back in the present, Simon is at work when
detective Roshan visits him.

00:13:32.639 --> 00:13:35.440
Simon composes himself and greets the detective.

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:40.389
Roshan asks him if Sarah revealed the nature
of her relationship with Nick, but Simon lies

00:13:40.389 --> 00:13:41.959
and says she didn’t.

00:13:41.959 --> 00:13:46.360
When asked where he was the day Nick was kidnapped,
Simon tells him that he was fishing in the

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:48.579
Russian River with his friend Darryl.

00:13:48.579 --> 00:13:51.769
Roshan asks for Darryl’s number and leaves
after.

00:13:51.769 --> 00:13:56.509
Right after the meeting, Simon texts Darryl
asking him not to answer his phone if someone

00:13:56.509 --> 00:13:57.639
calls him.

00:13:57.639 --> 00:14:02.050
At the same time, Roshan gets a call from
Pia, who demands to know if he is doing something

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:03.119
about the case.

00:14:03.119 --> 00:14:07.679
Roshan tells her he is in Sacramento to speak
with Simon and hangs up.

00:14:07.679 --> 00:14:12.199
After the call, Pia notices Nick’s pictures
from around the house inside a box.

00:14:12.199 --> 00:14:16.480
She goes to the room where everyone is enjoying
a family dinner and asks who took the pictures

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:17.690
off the wall.

00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:22.519
Sophie admits to taking them down because
she is ashamed to be Nick’s wife.

00:14:22.519 --> 00:14:26.889
The two step aside into a room where Pia says
that the text messages didn’t sound like

00:14:26.889 --> 00:14:28.220
Nick wrote them.

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:32.819
However, Sophie claims it will be easier if
they accept the fact and move on.

00:14:32.819 --> 00:14:36.320
Pia takes the last picture off the wall and
goes to her house.

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:40.879
Meanwhile, back in Sacramento, Simon calls
Darryl to his apartment and teaches him what

00:14:40.879 --> 00:14:43.279
he should say while being interrogated.

00:14:43.279 --> 00:14:46.230
Darryl freaks out and talks about turning
Simon in.

00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:51.980
At last, Simon threatens Darryl to go with
the story, clearly hiding something.
