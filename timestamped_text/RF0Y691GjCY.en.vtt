00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Hey everyone. Welcome back to Movie&nbsp;
Recap. Today I'm gonna show you a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.102
1980 psychological horror&nbsp;
film called, The Shining.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:19.760
Former teacher and recovering alcoholic Jack&nbsp;
Torrance interviews for a caretaker job at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.480
Overlook Hotel in an effort to rebuild his&nbsp;
life after his volatile temper lost him his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.080
teaching position. The hotel manager, Mr.&nbsp;
Stuart Ullman, warns Jack that he and his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:35.200
family will be snowbound through most of the&nbsp;
winter and of the potential risk for cabin fever.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.920
He drives the point home by recounting a&nbsp;
season when the caretaker, Charles Grady,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.120
went crazy and brutally killed his wife,&nbsp;
his two girls (Lisa Burns and Louise Burns),&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.800
and finally himself. Given his own desperation&nbsp;
and the opportunity to pursue his true passion,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.160
writing, Jack acknowledges the&nbsp;
warning, but accepts the job.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.680
Meanwhile, Jack's son Danny has a seizure while&nbsp;
talking to his imaginary friend Tony about the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.480
Overlook Hotel. He has a vision of blood&nbsp;
splashing out of an elevator in the hotel,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.772
an image which is revisited&nbsp;
several times throughout the film.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:18.400
Upon Danny's arrival at the hotel, head chef Dick&nbsp;
Hallorann recognizes that Danny is telepathic,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.680
and speaks to him mentally&nbsp;
to offer him some ice cream.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.800
He explains that he and his&nbsp;
grandmother both had the gift;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:30.240
she referred to this communication as "shining."&nbsp;
He also counsels Danny about the hotel, hinting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.960
that something terrible had happened there and&nbsp;
left a trace, "as if someone burned toast," which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:40.237
only people who can "shine" will perceive. Danny&nbsp;
questions Dick about what went on in the hotel,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:45.760
and about Room 237 in particular as Danny can&nbsp;
sense that Dick is especially afraid of that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.880
room. Though he strives to assure Danny that&nbsp;
the images he sees in the hotel are just "like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.680
pictures in a book" and can't hurt him, Dick&nbsp;
sternly warns Danny to stay out of that room.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.640
Jack's mental health deteriorates rapidly&nbsp;
once the family is alone in the hotel.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.360
He has writer's block, sleeps too little,&nbsp;
and is irritable. Danny has visions of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.960
the two murdered Grady girls, but tells no&nbsp;
one. He continues to wonder about Room 237.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.680
While the weather is still relatively warm,&nbsp;
Jack's wife Wendy and Danny walk through a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.560
maze of tall hedges, making a game out of it,&nbsp;
stopping at dead ends and fixing their mistakes.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.200
One day, a ball rolls toward Danny as he plays&nbsp;
with his toys. It appears to have come from the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:37.600
open door of Room 237, which Danny enters. At that&nbsp;
moment, Wendy comes running from the basement at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.080
the sound of Jack's screams in the lounge. He&nbsp;
tells her that he had a nightmare in which he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.600
used an axe to chop Danny and her to pieces. As&nbsp;
a disconcerted Wendy promises that "Everything's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.560
gonna be okay," Danny appear s at the other end&nbsp;
of the room, looking disoriented and sucking his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.400
thumb. His sweater is ripped and there are bruises&nbsp;
on his neck. He does not answer when Wendy asks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.840
what happened. She angrily accuses Jack of hurting&nbsp;
Danny and takes the child back to their suite.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.440
Jack is furious about the accusation. He&nbsp;
storms around the hotel, making his way to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.800
the Gold Ballroom. Sinking defeatedly onto a&nbsp;
stool at an empty bar, his head in his hands,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:22.080
Jack declares that he would sell his soul for one&nbsp;
drink. When he looks up he discovers a bartender,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:27.120
who serves him a drink. Jack is nonplussed by&nbsp;
the sudden appearance of the bartender and even&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:32.640
addresses him by his name, Lloyd. In the course&nbsp;
of telling his troubles to Lloyd, Jack reveals&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.880
that he unintentionally dislocated Danny's&nbsp;
shoulder, the same accident Wendy mentioned&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:42.480
to Danny's pediatrician earlier. Notably, Jack&nbsp;
states that the injury happened three years ago,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.120
while in explaining the same story to the&nbsp;
pediatrician, Wendy said that Jack, who vowed to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.080
quit drinking immediately following the accident,&nbsp;
has currently been sober for only five months.

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.560
A frantic Wendy enters, finding&nbsp;
Jack seemingly alone at the bar;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.880
she pleads with him to investigate Danny's&nbsp;
claim that "a crazy woman" attacked him in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:08.880
the bathtub of Room 237. Jack, who acts a bit&nbsp;
tipsy, grudgingly agrees to go have a look.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:17.280
As Jack approaches the door to Room 237, Danny&nbsp;
appears to be having a seizure in his own room.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.280
Dick, back at his home in Florida,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.320
stares wide-eyed as he picks up&nbsp;
on a signal Danny is sending.

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:31.200
Jack cautiously enters Room 237. The bedroom is&nbsp;
empty and he proceeds to the bathroom. He watches&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:36.480
lustfully as a young, beautiful, naked woman&nbsp;
pulls back the shower curtain and steps slowly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:42.000
out of the bathtub. The two approach each other&nbsp;
and embrace in a passionate kiss. Jack catches a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.720
glimpse of their reflection in the mirror and&nbsp;
sees the woman is actually a rotting corpse.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:51.760
He recoils in horror, the young lady standing&nbsp;
before him has transformed into an elderly woman,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:56.960
a walking corpse with rotten, sagging skin.&nbsp;
She cackles madly while reaching for him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:02.240
with outstretched arms. Stunned, Jack staggers&nbsp;
out of the room, locking the door after him.

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:10.080
When he reports back to Wendy, Jack denies&nbsp;
anything amiss in Room 237. Wendy suggests&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:15.840
they take Danny to a doctor. Jack becomes irate,&nbsp;
lecturing Wendy on her thoughtlessness and blaming&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:20.960
her for everything that's gone wrong in his life.&nbsp;
Insisting that they can't leave the hotel because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:26.640
of his obligation to his employers, he storms out,&nbsp;
returning to the Gold Room, which is now the scene&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:32.320
of an extravagant party with guests dressed in&nbsp;
1920's fashion. Lloyd serves him a drink and Jack&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:38.000
strolls through the crowd. He doesn't get far when&nbsp;
a butler carrying a tray runs into him, spilling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.960
advocaat on his jacket. The butler convinces&nbsp;
Jack to come into the bathroom to clean up.

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:50.720
The butler introduces himself as Delbert Grady.&nbsp;
Jack remembers the story Mr. Ullman told him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:56.400
about a former caretaker named Grady murdering his&nbsp;
family and confronts Grady with the information.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:00.640
Grady denies that anything of the sort&nbsp;
took place and furthermore insists that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:06.320
Jack has "always been the caretaker." Jack is&nbsp;
confused, but seems to accept Grady's story.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:10.640
Grady goes on to tell Jack that Danny&nbsp;
has "a great talent" and is using it to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:15.760
bring an "outside party" into the situation,&nbsp;
referring to Dick Halloran with a racial slur.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:20.720
Grady advises Jack on how to "correct" Danny,&nbsp;
and how to deal with Wendy if she interferes.

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:27.840
Back in Florida, Dick has had no luck&nbsp;
contacting the people at the Overlook Hotel.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:30.880
Worried about Danny, he books&nbsp;
the next flight to Colorado.

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:37.120
At the Overlook, Wendy arms herself&nbsp;
with a baseball bat and looks for Jack,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:41.520
intent on leaving the hotel with Danny&nbsp;
whether or not Jack agrees to come.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:46.480
Entering the lounge, she spots Jack's manuscript&nbsp;
left unattended next to the typewriter.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:51.360
She reads what Jack has been writing: hundreds&nbsp;
of pages of repetitions of a single sentence:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:56.080
"All work and no play makes Jack a dull&nbsp;
boy." She realizes that Jack has gone mad.

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:02.640
Jack approaches from behind and asks&nbsp;
sarcastically, "How do you like it?"&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:08.080
Wendy shrieks with alarm and wheels around to face&nbsp;
him. A confrontation ensues as Jack demands to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:12.960
know her intentions regarding leaving the hotel&nbsp;
with Danny, while Wendy retreats, brandishing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:18.480
the bat. She screams at Jack not to hurt her,&nbsp;
and he swears that he will not; instead, he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:23.520
intends to kill her. Wendy hits Jack on the head&nbsp;
with the bat at the top of a flight of stairs,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:28.695
causing him to lose his balance and tumble down&nbsp;
the staircase, injuring his ankle in the process.

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:35.920
Wendy drags Jack's limp body to the pantry&nbsp;
and locks him inside, just as he regains&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:41.440
consciousness. Jack tells her he has sabotaged&nbsp;
the radio, as well as the snow cat, stranding&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:46.634
them all there. She goes outside to check on&nbsp;
the snow cat, and confirms what he told her.

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:53.440
A few hours later, Jack is roused from a&nbsp;
nap by the sound of Delbert Grady's voice.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:57.840
Grady expresses disappointment and a lack&nbsp;
of confidence in Jack, but Jack assures&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:03.360
him he can get the job done if given one more&nbsp;
chance. The pantry door then suddenly unlocks.

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:10.960
Wendy has fallen asleep in her room. Danny is&nbsp;
in a trance, carrying a knife and muttering&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:16.800
"redrum" repeatedly. He takes Wendy's lipstick&nbsp;
and writes "REDRUM" on the bathroom door.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:21.360
He begins shouting "REDRUM," which&nbsp;
wakes Wendy. She clutches him to her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:25.840
then sees the reflection of the bathroom&nbsp;
door in the mirror. Reversed, it reads:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:30.240
"MURDER." At that instant, banging sounds&nbsp;
start coming from the door to the hallway.

00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:38.080
The sound is Jack swinging an axe at the locked&nbsp;
door. Wendy grabs Danny and locks them in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:43.840
bathroom. She opens a tiny, snow banked window&nbsp;
and pushes Danny out; he slides safely to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:49.440
ground. She tries to get out the same window,&nbsp;
but cannot fit. She tells Danny to run and hide.

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:55.360
Meanwhile, Jack has chopped his way&nbsp;
through the front door and calls out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:59.760
"Wendy, I'm home!" Jack then knocks&nbsp;
politely on the bathroom door.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:04.560
Wendy holds the knife and tries to steady&nbsp;
herself as Jack begins chopping into the door.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:08.800
After chopping away one of the panels,&nbsp;
he sticks his head through and screams.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:13.520
Jack sticks his hand through the door to turn&nbsp;
the lock. Wendy slashes at him with a knife,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:18.720
cutting Jack's hand and sending him recoiling&nbsp;
in pain. Jack continues to hack at the door with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:23.840
the axe until they both hear the low rumble of&nbsp;
an approaching snow cat engine. He stalks out.

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:32.640
The snow cat driver is Dick. Inside the&nbsp;
hotel, he calls out, but gets no reply. Jack,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:36.400
hiding behind a pillar, leaps out&nbsp;
and swings the axe into Dick's chest,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:39.520
killing him. Danny, hiding in a kitchen cabinet,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:44.560
screams, revealing his location. He clambers&nbsp;
out of the steel cabinet and runs outside.

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:52.000
Meanwhile, Wendy has ventured from the bathroom&nbsp;
and begun to search for Danny. The hotel has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.920
sprung to life and now even Wendy encounters its&nbsp;
ghosts, sights that shock and horrify her. At the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:03.676
same time, axe-wielding Jack turns on the outdoor&nbsp;
lights and follows Danny into the hedge maze.

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:10.400
Danny realizes he is leaving a trail of&nbsp;
footprints in the snow for Jack to follow.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:14.640
He carefully retraces his steps, walking&nbsp;
backwards in the same prints he'd just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:19.760
created in the opposite direction, then covers&nbsp;
the rest of his tracks and hides behind a hedge.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:24.800
When Jack arrives, he sees that the trail of&nbsp;
footprints ends abruptly, giving him no clue&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:29.920
as to which direction Danny took. He chooses&nbsp;
a path and lurches deeper into the maze.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:34.720
Danny comes out of his hiding spot and follows&nbsp;
his own footprints back to the maze's entrance.

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:41.280
Wendy makes her way out of the hotel&nbsp;
just as Danny emerges from the maze.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:46.720
Relieved, she flings down the knife and embraces&nbsp;
him. Jack bellows his frustration from within the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:52.244
maze. Danny and Wendy waste no time escaping in&nbsp;
the snow cat that Dick used to get to the hotel.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:55.600
Jack, hopelessly lost in&nbsp;
the maze, freezes to death.

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:02.960
Right before the end credits, the camera slowly&nbsp;
zooms in on a wall in the hotel full of old&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:07.520
photographs that chronicle the hotel's&nbsp;
history. An old recording of "Midnight,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:12.960
the Stars and You" echoes in the empty hallway.&nbsp;
In the center of one picture is a young Jack.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:17.755
The caption reads, "Overlook&nbsp;
Hotel, July 4th Ball, 1921."

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:23.680
