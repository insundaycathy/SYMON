00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.910
Following a nuclear holocaust, the world has
become a desert wasteland and civilization

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:12.220
has collapsed.

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:18.660
Max Rockatansky, a survivor, is captured by
the War Boys, the army of the tyrannical Immortan

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.560
Joe, and taken to Joe's Citadel.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.730
Designated a universal blood donor, Max is
imprisoned and used as a "blood bag" for a

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.850
sick War Boy called Nux.

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:35.550
Meanwhile, Imperator Furiosa, one of Joe's
lieutenants, is sent in her armoured semi-truck,

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.320
the "War Rig", to collect gasoline.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:45.359
When she drives off-route, Joe realizes that
his five wives—women selected for breeding—are

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:47.960
missing, and fleeing with her.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.371
Joe leads his entire army in pursuit of Furiosa,
calling on the aid of nearby Gas Town and

00:00:53.371 --> 00:00:54.700
the Bullet Farm.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:59.890
Nux joins the pursuit with Max strapped to
his car to continue supplying blood.

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.210
A battle ensues between the War Rig and Joe's
forces.

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.670
Furiosa drives into a sand storm, evading
her pursuers, except Nux, who attempts to

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.110
sacrifice himself to destroy the Rig.

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:12.110
Max escapes and restrains Nux, but the car
is destroyed.

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.140
After the storm, Max finds Furiosa repairing
the Rig, accompanied by the wives: Capable,

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:23.610
Cheedo, Toast, the Dag and the Splendid Angharad,
who is heavily pregnant with Joe's child.

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.570
Max steals the Rig, but its kill switch disables
it.

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:32.700
Max reluctantly agrees to let Furiosa and
the wives accompany him; Nux climbs on the

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.310
Rig as it leaves and attempts to kill Furiosa,
but is overcome and thrown out, and is picked

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.759
up by Joe's army.

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:44.930
Furiosa drives through a biker gang-controlled
canyon to barter a deal for safe passage.

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:50.869
However, with Joe's forces pursuing, the gang
turns on her, forcing her and the group to

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:55.229
flee, while the bikers detonate the canyon
walls to block Joe.

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:01.100
Max and Furiosa fight pursuing bikers as Joe's
car, with Nux now on board, breaks through

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.399
the blockade and eventually attacks the War
Rig, allowing Nux to board.

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:10.369
However, as the Rig escapes, Angharad falls
off in an attempt to protect Max and is run

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.040
over by Joe's car, killing her and her child.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.770
Furiosa explains to Max that they are escaping
to the "Green Place", an idyllic land she

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.459
remembers from her childhood.

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:27.060
Capable finds Nux hiding in the Rig, distraught
over his failure, and consoles him.

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.540
That night, the Rig gets stuck in the mud.

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:35.550
Furiosa and Max slow Joe's forces with mines,
but Joe's ally, the Bullet Farmer, continues

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.110
pursuing them.

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.090
Nux helps Max free the Rig while Furiosa shoots
and blinds the Bullet Farmer.

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.310
Max walks into the dark to confront the Bullet
Farmer and his men, returning with guns and

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.350
ammunition.They drive the War Rig overnight
through swampland and desert, coming across

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.100
a naked woman the next day.

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:58.160
Max suspects a trap, though Furiosa approaches
the woman and states her history and clan

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.170
affiliation.

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.970
The naked woman summons her clan, the Vuvalini,
who recognize Furiosa as one of their own

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.690
who was kidnapped as a child.

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:11.220
Furiosa is devastated to learn that the swampland
they passed was indeed the Green Place, now

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.670
uninhabitable.

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.110
The group then plans to ride motorbikes across
immense salt flats in the hope of finding

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:18.650
a new home.

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.520
Max chooses to stay behind, but after seeing
visions of a child he failed to save, he convinces

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:28.360
them to return to the undefended Citadel,
which has ample water and greenery that Joe

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.473
keeps for himself, and trap Joe and his army
in the bikers' canyon.

00:03:31.473 --> 00:03:36.220
The group heads back to the Citadel, but they
are attacked en route by Joe's forces, and

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.760
Furiosa is seriously wounded.

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:44.080
Joe positions his car in front of the War
Rig to slow it, while Max fights Joe's giant

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.850
son, Rictus Erectus.

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:51.430
Joe captures Toast, who manages to distract
him long enough for Furiosa to kill him.

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:57.070
Nux sacrifices himself by wrecking the Rig,
killing Rictus and blocking the canyon, allowing

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:03.330
Max, Furiosa, the wives, and the surviving
Vuvalini to escape in Joe's car, where Max

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.950
transfuses his blood to Furiosa, saving her
life.

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:11.310
At the Citadel, the impoverished citizens
react to Joe's death with joy.

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:16.730
Furiosa, the wives, and the Vuvalini are cheered
by the people and welcomed by the remaining

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:18.009
War Boys.

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:22.900
Max shares a respectful glance with Furiosa
before blending into the crowd and again departing

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.911
for parts unknown.
