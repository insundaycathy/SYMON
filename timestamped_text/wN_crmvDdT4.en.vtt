00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.731
hi what's up guys

00:00:05.987 --> 00:00:09.763
Today I'm gonna show you a sci-fi film the "Reign of Fire"

00:00:10.083 --> 00:00:11.875
David comes to visit his mother

00:00:12.131 --> 00:00:14.563
who's an engineer in charge of the construction

00:00:14.755 --> 00:00:15.843
 on the London underground

00:00:16.291 --> 00:00:18.339
workers happen to penetrate a cave

00:00:18.467 --> 00:00:20.131
which arises David's attention

00:00:20.643 --> 00:00:21.987
out of curiosity

00:00:22.243 --> 00:00:24.995
he then slips into the cave for more exploration

00:00:25.251 --> 00:00:28.387
but finds nothing except some kind of horrible creature

00:00:28.835 --> 00:00:32.163
he rushes to inform all others out of the danger

00:00:32.547 --> 00:00:33.827
but it's too late

00:00:34.403 --> 00:00:36.323
the creature has been wakened up from hibernation

00:00:36.451 --> 00:00:38.435
it come following the tunnel 

00:00:38.627 --> 00:00:40.803
with burning flames blown out of its mouth

00:00:41.251 --> 00:00:42.211
the mother is freaked out 

00:00:42.403 --> 00:00:44.643
and wanna take David out to the ground from a lift

00:00:44.963 --> 00:00:46.691
but soon she is cut dead 

00:00:46.947 --> 00:00:50.467
by the sharp crawl of a fire dragon following tightly behind

00:00:50.851 --> 00:00:52.451
before it flies out of the underground

00:00:52.835 --> 00:00:54.179
still under the panic

00:00:54.435 --> 00:00:57.123
David finds his mother has been killed protecting him

00:00:57.507 --> 00:01:00.899
David is the only survivor who saw the fire dragon

00:01:01.347 --> 00:01:02.947
many years that follow

00:01:03.203 --> 00:01:05.379
he keeps tracking the movement of these creatures

00:01:05.699 --> 00:01:07.939
scientists believe that it's the fire dragon 

00:01:08.131 --> 00:01:11.011
who has ever burned dinosaurs on Earth to extinction

00:01:11.331 --> 00:01:13.891
and after that they all go into hibernation underground 

00:01:14.019 --> 00:01:15.299
to avoid starvation

00:01:16.003 --> 00:01:18.755
since they've awakened right now they mass reproduce

00:01:18.883 --> 00:01:20.931
and will destroy the whole world again

00:01:21.507 --> 00:01:24.195
the mankind's resistance including the nuclear weapons

00:01:24.387 --> 00:01:27.331
only turns out to hasten the destruction of human societies

00:01:27.651 --> 00:01:29.827
which are nearly extinct by 2020

00:01:30.211 --> 00:01:31.811
with many years' experience 

00:01:32.003 --> 00:01:34.243
gained from fighting against the fire dragons

00:01:34.435 --> 00:01:37.059
David turns an abandoned castle into a shelter

00:01:37.315 --> 00:01:38.595
 for the remaining survivors

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:41.987
some day a man can't wait any longer to find some food 

00:01:42.115 --> 00:01:43.971
outside for his starving children

00:01:44.547 --> 00:01:47.427
the man disobeys the order and heads out privately

00:01:47.875 --> 00:01:50.051
but he is caught up by the fire dragon

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:52.163
 and gets his one child killed

00:01:52.611 --> 00:01:56.835
David shows up with a fire-proof truck for their protection

00:01:57.283 --> 00:01:59.331
but on their way back

00:01:59.651 --> 00:02:02.211
they're stopped and attacked by the fire dragon 

00:02:02.403 --> 00:02:03.747
and get another guy killed

00:02:04.067 --> 00:02:06.691
before they're all retreated safe back into the shelter

00:02:07.395 --> 00:02:09.251
still under the frustration

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:12.643
people in the shelter are visited by some unexpected guests

00:02:12.963 --> 00:02:15.779
the Chief requests David to offer one night stay

00:02:15.907 --> 00:02:17.507
 in the shelter for his squad

00:02:17.763 --> 00:02:19.299
who has come all the way from the US 

00:02:19.491 --> 00:02:21.283
and lost more than a hundred of the team member

00:02:21.795 --> 00:02:23.715
David wanna turn down the chief's request 

00:02:23.907 --> 00:02:26.979
until he realize the Chief is a real dragon hunter

00:02:27.107 --> 00:02:29.155
and knows the weakness of the fire dragons

00:02:29.603 --> 00:02:32.163
what's more the squad even get their own tanks

00:02:32.291 --> 00:02:34.403
 and helicopters for hunting the dragons

00:02:35.043 --> 00:02:36.707
at that right time

00:02:36.835 --> 00:02:38.627
they're alerted by the dragon's coming attack

00:02:39.075 --> 00:02:40.803
the Chief dispatch his team out immediately 

00:02:40.995 --> 00:02:42.531
to get ready for the attack

00:02:43.363 --> 00:02:46.563
the helicopter flies up high in the air for surveillance

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:49.251
while the motor men set up some kind of devices 

00:02:49.443 --> 00:02:50.979
on the ground for position purpose

00:02:51.427 --> 00:02:52.963
after all's set

00:02:53.091 --> 00:02:54.883
some men on the helicopter jump down first

00:02:55.075 --> 00:02:56.419
 to attract the dragons' attention

00:02:56.547 --> 00:02:59.171
while the other two jump down later 

00:02:59.427 --> 00:03:01.795
intending to shoot nets at the dragons and trap them

00:03:02.435 --> 00:03:03.587
but due to the low visibility

00:03:03.779 --> 00:03:05.251
they misses the fire dragons

00:03:05.575 --> 00:03:06.535
what's worse

00:03:06.535 --> 00:03:09.361
one man hits the ground badly due to high speed 

00:03:09.677 --> 00:03:12.173
and another man turns to be the prey of the dragon

00:03:12.941 --> 00:03:14.989
when knowing David is standing close to the dragons

00:03:15.117 --> 00:03:16.781
the Chief orders him to play the bait 

00:03:17.293 --> 00:03:19.085
in order to lead dragons into the trap 

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:23.117
David follows the instruction and rides the horse over a slope

00:03:23.565 --> 00:03:26.381
it turns out a dragon following tightly behind 

00:03:26.765 --> 00:03:28.493
is shot dead by somebody waiting there

00:03:28.941 --> 00:03:31.501
people in the shelter are all encouraged 

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:33.037
and cheering up for the hunting

00:03:33.933 --> 00:03:37.197
the Chief, who's lost another three members in this battle

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:39.309
can't accept people's compliment

00:03:39.821 --> 00:03:42.189
but rather, he turns to mock at people's helpless

00:03:42.957 --> 00:03:45.965
David stops the Chief for the reason they come to England

00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:49.549
he is told the team has hunted hundreds of fire dragons

00:03:49.741 --> 00:03:51.981
but only find that they are all female dragons

00:03:52.429 --> 00:03:55.629
that would mean there's only one male dragon in their species

00:03:56.333 --> 00:03:57.869
they get to hunt the male dragon down 

00:03:58.189 --> 00:03:59.597
to make peace once for all

00:04:00.237 --> 00:04:03.245
right now they've tracked down the only one male dragon

00:04:03.437 --> 00:04:04.525
 located in London

00:04:05.165 --> 00:04:08.365
despite this David refuses their request for 

00:04:08.493 --> 00:04:10.477
more soldiers and supplies for the team

00:04:10.605 --> 00:04:12.397
and wanna evict them out of the shelter

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:14.189
from the reasons given by David

00:04:14.381 --> 00:04:16.557
the Chief knows that David has actually met with

00:04:16.685 --> 00:04:17.581
 the male dragon 

00:04:17.901 --> 00:04:20.205
during that disaster which killed his mother

00:04:20.461 --> 00:04:23.277
however, the Chief does't wanna give up

00:04:23.405 --> 00:04:25.901
he even plans to hire some soldiers from the crowd

00:04:26.157 --> 00:04:27.565
which anger David greatly 

00:04:28.013 --> 00:04:29.997
David gets into a fight with the Chief

00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:32.557
at last the Chief gets no choice but to leave 

00:04:32.685 --> 00:04:33.965
with his remaining guys

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:36.269
after one day's progressing

00:04:36.397 --> 00:04:38.829
the team finally makes it to the suburb area of London

00:04:38.957 --> 00:04:41.325
to which all of the entries are blocked up

00:04:42.157 --> 00:04:44.077
they send the girl out to look for another way

00:04:44.397 --> 00:04:45.549
but right at that time

00:04:45.933 --> 00:04:48.557
the male dragon shows up in the far end of the city

00:04:49.005 --> 00:04:50.925
with its red flames blown out 

00:04:51.309 --> 00:04:52.973
and shinning the night sky bright 

00:04:53.165 --> 00:04:55.277
with no time to find cover 

00:04:55.597 --> 00:04:57.389
the Chief keeps shooting at the coming dragon 

00:04:57.709 --> 00:04:59.181
but he is turned down by the hot waves

00:04:59.565 --> 00:05:01.037
do does the whole team 

00:05:01.357 --> 00:05:03.341
whose bullet rain seems to pose no threats 

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:04.493
on the burning dragon

00:05:05.325 --> 00:05:06.413
by the time the girl comes back

00:05:06.797 --> 00:05:10.061
she only finds that the whole team is gone with nothing left

00:05:10.637 --> 00:05:13.389
the Chief is lucky enough to survive the attack

00:05:13.837 --> 00:05:17.037
on the other side rather than flying back to its base

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:19.789
the male dragon keeps heading towards David's shelter

00:05:20.109 --> 00:05:21.837
and sets the castle into big fires

00:05:22.605 --> 00:05:24.589
people are relocated to a safe house

00:05:25.037 --> 00:05:26.957
right when David's friend is about to relocate 

00:05:27.149 --> 00:05:28.173
more people inside

00:05:28.493 --> 00:05:30.605
the dragon launches its attack at the safe house

00:05:30.989 --> 00:05:33.293
the friend chooses to sacrifice himself 

00:05:33.485 --> 00:05:35.341
by closing up the door from outside

00:05:36.109 --> 00:05:39.821
the second day David is wakened up by the Chief and the girl

00:05:40.461 --> 00:05:42.381
by the time they go out from the safe house

00:05:42.637 --> 00:05:45.197
they only see everything is burned into pieces

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:46.925
finding nowhere to retreat

00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:50.317
David decides to go alone with the Chief and the girl

00:05:50.637 --> 00:05:53.325
along the Times Rive all the way up to London city

00:05:53.837 --> 00:05:56.077
which has turned to be the reproduction base of the dragons

00:05:56.589 --> 00:05:58.701
thanks to his familiarity with the London city

00:05:59.085 --> 00:06:00.749
David follows the tunnel route 

00:06:00.941 --> 00:06:02.477
and leads the Chief to the square

00:06:02.733 --> 00:06:04.717
where the male dragon is supposed to inhabit

00:06:05.549 --> 00:06:07.981
right after they set up a plan for the attack

00:06:08.237 --> 00:06:11.181
the male dragon flies back roaring over the sky

00:06:11.821 --> 00:06:14.189
the girl plays the bait to attract its attention

00:06:14.445 --> 00:06:16.237
the male dragon approaches the girl 

00:06:16.493 --> 00:06:18.413
and is about to blow out its flames at her

00:06:18.733 --> 00:06:20.717
but right then the Chief shows up 

00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:22.701
and shoots it with a gunpowder arrow

00:06:22.893 --> 00:06:23.853
which injures the dragon 

00:06:24.109 --> 00:06:25.709
and makes it to plunge towards the Chief

00:06:25.965 --> 00:06:28.013
who takes his last courage to face the death

00:06:28.845 --> 00:06:31.277
David meets up with the girl

00:06:31.533 --> 00:06:33.325
and wanna revenge against the dragon 

00:06:33.709 --> 00:06:34.797
with gunpowder arrows

00:06:35.245 --> 00:06:37.165
while David is preparing for the arrow

00:06:37.485 --> 00:06:39.725
the male dragon locates him and is about to attack

00:06:40.813 --> 00:06:42.157
luckily under the cover from the girl

00:06:42.285 --> 00:06:43.949
who's rushing out with machine gun

00:06:44.333 --> 00:06:45.485
David takes the only chance 

00:06:45.613 --> 00:06:48.045
to shoot the gunpowder arrow into its open mouth

00:06:48.557 --> 00:06:50.221
which blows up the male dragon finally

00:06:50.925 --> 00:06:52.397
in the following months

00:06:52.589 --> 00:06:53.997
there are no more dragon attacks 

00:06:54.189 --> 00:06:55.597
after death of the male dragon

00:06:56.173 --> 00:06:58.029
David regains his control of fears 

00:06:58.221 --> 00:06:59.821
from the courages shown by the Chief

00:07:00.013 --> 00:07:02.381
while the lucky survivors are all gathering up 

00:07:02.637 --> 00:07:05.069
for the rebuild of their civilization from the ruins

00:07:05.709 --> 00:07:07.309
