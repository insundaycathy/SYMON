00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:15.600
Hi guys, Korean Movie Recapped here. Before&nbsp;
we start, WARNING! Spoilers Ahead! Today,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.280
I’m going to recap a 2020 Korean&nbsp;
Thriller-Drama movie called Alive.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:25.520
A grisly virus ravages the whole city while a lone&nbsp;
man locks himself inside his apartment to survive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.640
the zombie-like infected victim army lurking&nbsp;
outside. Digitally cut off from seeking help,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.440
he desperately tries to find another way out.&nbsp;
How long will he be able to survive alone?

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:42.080
The story starts with Jun-woo, who is a gamer&nbsp;
and streamer, alone at home. He just wakes up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.800
and finds that his father, mother, and sister&nbsp;
have left the apartment for their daily activity.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.360
He starts his gaming session until his friends&nbsp;
tell him to immediately turn on the TV.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.280
He turns on the TV to find out that every news on&nbsp;
tv is covering a strange disease that is currently&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:03.440
rapidly spreading across the country. Suddenly, an&nbsp;
emergency alert starts going off from his phone.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.440
He looks outside from his balcony&nbsp;
and sees a pandemonium breaking out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.800
The zombie-like disease causes infected people&nbsp;
to bite and eat uninfected people nearby, thereby&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.920
infecting them. People are running away in panic&nbsp;
and fear, turning the city into a complete chaos.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.080
Jun-woo hears a loud noise from his&nbsp;
door and foolishly opens the door.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.120
A strange man comes rushing in and tells&nbsp;
him that he is his neighbor from unit 403.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.640
Jun-woo, sensing something wrong, tries to get&nbsp;
him out of the apartment, but the man pleads to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.520
let him use the toilet. While the man is inside&nbsp;
the toilet, he sees the news talking about the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.720
symptoms and the cannibalistic tendencies of the&nbsp;
infected. When the man comes out of the toilet,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.000
Jun-woo immediately grabs a knife. The man tries&nbsp;
to convince him that he is uninfected and pleads&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.960
to him to let him stay inside the apartment.&nbsp;
But suddenly, he bleeds from his eyes and turns&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.680
hostile. Jun-woo barely manages to get him&nbsp;
out of his apartment to avoid getting eaten.

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.120
He quickly tries to assess the situation&nbsp;
and uses the fridge to barricade the door.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.360
He then tries to contact his family&nbsp;
but fails. When he eventually receives&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.360
a message from his mother assuring him of&nbsp;
their safety and urging him to stay home,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.760
he calms down a little. He realizes that&nbsp;
he will be stuck inside the apartment for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.160
a while so he starts rationing supplies, but&nbsp;
it’s hard as they were little, to begin with.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.640
On the next day, he wakes up to find&nbsp;
out that the situation hasn’t changed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.680
He is still unable to contact his family.&nbsp;
He finds out that the internet is filled&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.920
with survivors posting about their condition&nbsp;
and putting up their addresses in hope that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.360
the rescue team will come to them,&nbsp;
so Jun-woo puts up his own post.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.600
The tech-savvy Jun-woo decides to attach his phone&nbsp;
to a drone to survey his surrounding area. He gets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.480
to see that most, if not all the occupants of the&nbsp;
apartment complex he lives in are now zombies.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.960
At a certain height, his phone gets a&nbsp;
signal service and he once again tries&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:58.080
to call his family. But he stops the operation&nbsp;
once he notices that the drone battery is low.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.720
Feeling frustrated he decides to just game&nbsp;
it out, but soon the internet connection&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.640
is also down. Having nothing else&nbsp;
to do, he decides to go to bed.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.680
He wakes up to a loud noise and looks outside&nbsp;
only to see a policewoman trying to run away&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.800
from his infected colleague. In yet another&nbsp;
foolish move, Jun-woo attempts to scare off the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.360
zombies from hundreds of meters away by yelling&nbsp;
at them as the policewoman is being torn to bits.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.880
Instead of saving the policewoman, it attracts&nbsp;
the attention of a zombie close to his apartment.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:32.240
The zombie manages to break into his apartment by&nbsp;
pushing open the door alongside the refrigerator.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:36.000
He barely manages to survive by tricking&nbsp;
the zombie to jump out the window.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.320
He is unharmed but the foolish encounter&nbsp;
with the zombie has further reduced his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.160
food supply as the food inside the&nbsp;
fridge falls all over the floor.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.000
He fixes the door and records another&nbsp;
video of himself to lift up his spirit.

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.040
On the next morning, he doesn’t have any choice&nbsp;
besides having breakfast with his father’s liquor.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.320
Learning from his past mistakes, he seals&nbsp;
the entire balcony. He watches a ramen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:03.200
noodle commercial on the TV and can’t help but&nbsp;
eat his last stock of food. While eating the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.560
last noodles in the house, he accidentally knocks&nbsp;
over the last bottle of water. He soon finds out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.960
that the tap water also stops running, making&nbsp;
him licks the spilled water from the table.

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.040
It has been 15 days since he locked&nbsp;
himself inside the apartment now.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.640
Deprived of social interaction and the constant&nbsp;
consumption of alcohol as his only last supply,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:27.840
making him hallucinate reuniting with his family.&nbsp;
He becomes emotional and curls up on the floor.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:33.040
He wakes up to a call that turns out to be his&nbsp;
mother, but the signal is so bad he barely hears&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:37.760
a thing. He stands on the edge of his balcony&nbsp;
to get a better signal and hears that something&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:42.560
is not quite right with his family. Feeling&nbsp;
frustrated, he breaks things in his apartment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:47.600
and goes outside to take out his anger on the&nbsp;
zombies. This foolish act soon bites back as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:52.640
he is nearly swamped in a horde of zombies. He&nbsp;
barely manages to get back inside his apartment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:57.760
but he has lost all his spirit. He decides to take&nbsp;
his own life before the zombies can get to him.

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:03.200
As Jun-woo dangles from a cable he tied around&nbsp;
his neck, a laser beam suddenly projects from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:07.920
the apartment building across the street. He&nbsp;
sees a lady in an apartment across the street&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:13.600
and immediately waves excitedly to her. She waves&nbsp;
back and gestures to him to contact her again at 7&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:20.000
A.M. tomorrow. Now that he finds another survivor,&nbsp;
he gains back his will to live. Unlike Jun-woo,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.640
the lady seems very organized and has modified&nbsp;
her apartment into booby traps for zombies.

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:30.880
On the next morning, Jun-woo overslept and&nbsp;
woke up at 11 A.M.. He gestures his apology&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:35.696
and writes his name on the phone. The lady&nbsp;
reciprocates and introduces herself as Yoo-bin.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:42.000
After communicating for a while, Yoo-bin hears a&nbsp;
noise from her door. She tells Jun-woo to contact&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.040
her again at 7 A.M. tomorrow. As she tries to&nbsp;
look for the source of the noise, she finds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:52.240
her traps had trapped a zombie that made its way&nbsp;
into her house, she proceeds to axe its head off.

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.640
On the next morning at the agreed-upon time,&nbsp;
Yoo-bin tries to pass food over to Jun-woo&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:02.160
after seeing him starving. She attaches a rope to&nbsp;
a baseball and throws it across, but it fails to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:06.800
reach his apartment and falls in the middle of&nbsp;
the street. Jun-woo then uses his drone to pass&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:12.480
a rope to Yoo-bin. Using that rope bridge, Yoo-bin&nbsp;
passes a container of snacks and a bottle of water&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:17.760
to him. As he gestures his gratitude to Yoo-bin,&nbsp;
he notices that the ball with the rope that failed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:21.840
to make it across seems to have become a ladder&nbsp;
for one of the zombies to climb up to Yoo-bin’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:26.880
apartment. Jun-woo immediately gestures this&nbsp;
to her but she can’t react fast enough and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:32.400
gets hit by the table where she tied the rope.&nbsp;
He uses his drone to distract the zombie. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:36.960
zombie manages to destroy the drone but it gives&nbsp;
Yoo-bin enough time to axe off the hand of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:42.480
zombie causing him to fall down. She survives&nbsp;
with a minor bruise on her stomach. She then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:47.040
tidies up her apartment and reads Jun-woo’s&nbsp;
message across the street, motivating her.

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:52.240
Running low on supplies, Jun-woo decides to&nbsp;
go to the other apartment unit to scavenge&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:57.440
for leftover supplies. He manages to get some&nbsp;
food and two walkie-talkies before he flees&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:02.160
back to his apartment. That night, he feast on&nbsp;
those sweet loots that he managed to gather.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:06.880
He sends back the container Yoo-bin gave&nbsp;
him with some food and the walkie-talkie.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:12.240
With the walkie-talkie, they can finally truly&nbsp;
communicate. Jun-woo feels excited as they talk&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:16.560
more. He is able to thank Yoo-bin for saving&nbsp;
him when he decided to take his own life.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:22.720
But unknown to him, Yoo-bin also tried to do it&nbsp;
as well before. To celebrate this minor victory,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:26.080
they eat ramen noodles together as they&nbsp;
talk to get to know each other more.

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:30.000
While they talk, Jun-woo tells&nbsp;
Yoo-bin to bring out basins to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.400
collect rainwater as he can hear heavy&nbsp;
sounds outside and thinks that it’s raining.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:39.120
They look out the balcony, but it’s not&nbsp;
raining. Instead, they see a multitude&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:43.840
of zombie hordes running into both apartment&nbsp;
complexes simultaneously for an unknown reason.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:48.800
They both lie low and try to stay silent but&nbsp;
Yoo-bin accidentally knocks over a shelf in her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:53.920
apartment. She knows that her apartment will soon&nbsp;
be swamped with hordes of zombies, so she tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:57.840
Jun-woo that she will leave her apartment&nbsp;
and head to the 8th floor of his apartment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:02.560
building which she noticed is empty. They both&nbsp;
agree to go up together and prepare themself.

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:07.760
Yoo-bin jumps down her balcony with a rope,&nbsp;
like a badass lass she is, and maneuvers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:12.880
herself between zombies. On the way, she picks up&nbsp;
a gun that was dropped by the policewoman before.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:17.120
Jun-woo runs out to help her and they&nbsp;
both barely miss being surrounded by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:22.160
hordes of zombies as they enter the elevator&nbsp;
to get to the 8th floor. As expected before,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:26.640
the 8th floor is completely empty so they&nbsp;
try to get into one of the apartment units.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:31.840
But the calm only lasts for a moment as suddenly&nbsp;
a zombie appears followed by a horde of zombies.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:36.480
A mysterious man suddenly appears just before they&nbsp;
get eaten and pulls them inside his apartment.

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:42.400
At first, they were wary of the mysterious&nbsp;
man. But over time, they are overjoyed as the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:48.400
man offers them food from his seemingly abundant&nbsp;
supplies. They finally can relax for a while. This&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:52.800
blessing is short-lived as they soon discover&nbsp;
that their food has been laced with drugs.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:57.360
The man is planning to offer them as a meal to&nbsp;
his wife that has been turned into a zombie.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:00.720
Yoo-bin wakes up zip-tied and locked&nbsp;
inside a room with the zombie wife.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:06.560
Jun-woo awakes and struggles to hold the rope that&nbsp;
holds the zombie wife. The room suddenly becomes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:12.160
quiet so the man unlocks the door. Suddenly the&nbsp;
wife zombie charges at the man and bites him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:16.080
The man willingly lets her eat him as he&nbsp;
loves his wife and doesn’t want her to starve.

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:21.120
Yoo-bin fires the gun at both of them to end their&nbsp;
suffering, but this only draws the attention of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:26.320
more zombies. Seeing no way out, they decide to&nbsp;
shoot themselves before the zombies get to them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:31.360
Just before they pull the trigger, they&nbsp;
hear the rescue helicopter flying nearby.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:35.760
With hope rekindled in them, they struggle to&nbsp;
make it to the rooftop, only to find out that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:40.880
the helicopter is no longer in sight. The zombies&nbsp;
follow them to the rooftop as well and they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:45.920
gradually creep closer and closer. They run out of&nbsp;
bullets as they stand on the edge of the building.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:50.880
Just when they are about to be swamped by the&nbsp;
zombie horde, the rescue helicopter appears&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:54.240
behind them and shoots at the zombies&nbsp;
while pulling them inside to safety.

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:58.720
Inside the helicopter, Jun-woo is&nbsp;
finally able to get signal service&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:02.800
and receive a message from his family,&nbsp;
telling him that they are okay. They&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:06.240
finally can breathe the wind peacefully&nbsp;
as they fly away to safety together.
