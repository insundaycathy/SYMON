00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.430
Welcome to Cinema Summary, ladies and gentlemen.

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:09.540
People change right?

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.540
Sometimes for the
worse, and sometimes for the better.

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.050
But let's see how bad people can get

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:16.400
This is The Invitation

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.680
So, the first things we see are Will and Kira
in a car,

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.420
and they have been invited to a reunion

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:23.660
dinner with some old friends of Will.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.950
And Will is anxious about going: It’s been
a while since he’s talked to these friends,

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:33.080
and the dinner is being hosted by Eden and David, Will’s
ex-wife, and David, her current husband.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.800
On their way there, they run into a coyote
that Will has to put it out of its misery:

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.640
killing it with a tire iron.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:40.520
*Yelp of Pain*

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:47.859
and they continue on until finally they get to
Eden’s fancy house in Hollywood Hills.

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:51.170
It's the same house that Will and Eden shared back
when they were married.

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.820
As he walks in, Will can’t help but think
about Ty, his son.

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.720
Who used to live in the house with them

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.200
When he comes out of his flashback, he’s
warmly greeted by his old friends:

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.820
Gina, Tommy,

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:07.800
Miguel, Ben, and Claire although they are missing someone else and that's Choi, Gina’s boyfriend.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.320
and after the realize this, that’s when Eden comes downstairs

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.640
and she’s happy, she’s touchy-feely, and as she says hello to Will

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:19.020
Maybe it’s her smile or the way she’s
acting, but something about her is off.

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.100
and it’s very awkward for everyone involved

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.781
and it only gets worse when we meet David: Eden’s current husband, who

00:01:25.781 --> 00:01:29.180
kind of looks like a mirror image of Will
down to the beard and green shirt.

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.000
Except, David is also like Eden:

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.130
being touchy-feely, and happy, and creepy.

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.549
Then David gives everyone some wine and makes
a toast and during the toast, Will looks away

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.160
and spots a half naked woman standing in a doorframe of a bedroom

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.230
who smiles at him and leaves

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.820
and moments later we are introduced to Sadie

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.790
the woman that Will saw earlier and she’s a bit of a

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:55.179
weirdo and very quirky, and no one know who she is
or why she’s here except Eden and David

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.140
Who know her from the support group in Mexico

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.640
She’s staying with them to 'help out'

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.270
And after an awkward silence, Kira breaks the ice by talking about the coyote

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.009
that was killed by Will.

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.750
and everyone’s put off by the story except for
Sadie, who thinks that’s pretty cool and

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:15.160
David who respects Will for killing the coyote
out of mercy, and taking away its pain.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.600
So Will decides to take the chance to go to the
kitchen to look around and see how the house

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.400
has changed (but you can tell he just wants
some space),

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.050
and as he stands near the sink, he

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.270
has another flashback: to a memory of Eden
trying to kill herself.

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:27.720
She’s so different now.

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:28.720
It’s strange.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.020
That’s when Eden decides to come in and
get some glasses and we find out that things

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.750
have changed: now the windows have bars on
them, and that ever since Mexico, Eden has

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:37.750
been better.

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.710
More stable, having gotten over whatever caused
her to try and kill herself.

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:46.010
But as Will listens to Eden, he feels that
something’s off about her.

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:51.230
But Eden reassures Will that she’s okay
and is ‘over it’, whatever that is and

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.420
she wants Will to be ‘over it’ too.

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.520
As Will comes out of the kitchen he spots
David on the phone and then a few moments

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:58.520
the door bell rings

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.920
At first everyone think it’s Choi, Gina’s
boyfriend who still hasn’t shown up, but

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.380
its actually Pruitt.

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.250
A friend of Sadie, Eden, and David.

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.680
A friend, the rest of group have never met.

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:09.700
*Confused and uncomfortable stuttering*

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:15.040
Well you got to admit inviting 2 strangers to a reunion dinner

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.410
By the way, where’s Choi? He should
have been here by now!

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.280
And Gina tries to call him but can’t due
to bad phone reception.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.765
And then, David locks the door but Will feels
that it’s unnecessary for David to do that

00:03:24.765 --> 00:03:28.470
and calls him out on it and although they
don’t make a big deal out of it, David does leave

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.160
the key in the door but leaves it locked.

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:36.460
After that ‘confrontation-conversation’,
Eden asks Will to get some firewood from outside

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.000
and on his way out, Will passes a room.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.660
And he almost goes in but for some reason,
decides not to.

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.810
Outside, he remembers hearing the voice of
his son, Ty, playing in the backyard and as

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.340
he stands there, he spots Eden in her bedroom,
hiding ‘something’ in a drawer.

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.200
Will comes back inside and decides to go to the bedroom,

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.440
where he finds a bottle of pills in the drawer and decides to keep one.

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.160
As he is about to sneak out, David catches
him but lets him stay in the room.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.451
To let Will come to terms with the changes
in the house and Will stays there, remembering

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:06.720
better times with Eden.

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.460
Remembering their son, who we still haven’t
seen or heard mentioned about around the house.

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:15.260
Back in the common room, the group realize that Eden, Sadie, Pruitt, and David

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:16.540
are part of a cult.

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.640
And while they are totally denying it they explain what it is

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.540
It's called The Invitation, and back in Mexico, Eden and David met each other there

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.560
and they describe it more like a 'support group'

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:27.440
to help people get over their grief and pain.

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.640
It’s not just popular in Mexico, it's also popular in America

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.200
"Here in LA, New York".

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.440
As David explains that there are thousands of other cultists. Uh... "group members"

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:37.800
In the LA/New York Area

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.480
The group tries to politely ask them for more details

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.790
and David decides to show them a video
on his laptop.

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:48.100
And it’s a recruitment video: hosted by
Dr. Joseph, the cult leader, who teaches some

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.440
spiritual, New Age ways to deal with trauma
and the pain of loss.

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:55.860
It’s pretty normal until we see a woman
dying from cancer as she talks about the afterlife

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.841
with the cult leader, and as she dies, the
cult leader tries to reassure the people in

00:04:59.841 --> 00:05:02.370
the video that she is in a better place.

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:05.980
and the video ends and the group realize they
just watched someone die

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:10.840
and they are either grossed out, freaked out, or trying to be respectful of their beliefs'
with it.

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:12.490
Except Pruitt, Eden, Sadie, and David.

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:14.710
Who insist that “it’s a good thing”.

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:18.160
Turning pain into something positive; getting
rid of your fear of death.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:23.320
David insists that the cult is GOOD and almost
mentions what happened between Eden and Will

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.380
but Will stops him from talking about it.

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:30.040
That’s when Eden praises it and says it’s
transformed her life and she’s better for

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:30.540
it.

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:34.960
But, overwhelmed, Will leaves for the kitchen,
he doesn’t believe for a second that she’s

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:37.510
actually gotten over what happened between
Will and her.

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:40.940
When he finally goes back to the common room,
David apologizes for what he showed and to

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:42.980
make up for it, he suggests that they play
a game.

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:45.660
A game called “I Want”: It’s a game
that David and Eden

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:48.230
played back in Mexico and it's kind of like "I Have Never".

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:52.700
so, Sadie goes first and what she wants
to do is tell everyone she loves them and

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:54.800
then makes out with Gina.

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.400
Rules are pretty clear: You get what you want!

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:58.510
Fun if a bit weird.

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:03.750
Gina goes next and she hesitantly says that
she wants cocaine, and David has some and gives

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:05.950
it to her (much to everyone’s surprise).

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:09.800
And then Pruitt goes next and goes into great
detail about his ex-wife.

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:14.810
How he accidentally killed her, in the kitchen after hitting
her so hard that she knocked her head

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:19.400
and he went to jail, and he found
‘religion’ in the cult, and now he's over it

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:24.000
He stills misses her but he doesn’t feel
the pain of loss: after all, he will see her

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.280
in the afterlife..

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:28.060
And after THAT, everyone’s super uncomfortable

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:31.080
that was weird, inappropriate and it feels like

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:33.460
Pruitt is trying to persuade them to join
the cult.

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:36.400
And then it's Eden's turn and she wants to kiss Ben

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:39.560
and SHE KISSES Ben with tongue and everything.

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:42.780
By this point, Claire has had enough of this
‘weirdness’ and just wants to leave although

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:44.640
David tries to get her to stay.

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:48.660
But a stern word from Will, gets David to
back off and they let her go with Pruitt going

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:51.160
with her to move his car since his car is
in the way.

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:55.460
And Will can’t help but watch from the window
with suspicion, he doesn’t trust Pruitt;

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:57.840
and that’s when David takes him aside to
chat privately.

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:02.110
And he lays it on Will: since the beginning
of the night, Will has been so suspicious

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:03.830
of them for no reason.

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:07.669
Always questioning him about things like locking
the doors, or watching Pruitt drive his car

00:07:07.669 --> 00:07:08.669
out of the way.

00:07:08.669 --> 00:07:11.910
He just wants Will to relax, and Will confesses
that he doesn’t really want to be here because

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:13.530
he’s not ready to be here.

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:17.220
and David kind of understands with the y'know, the divorce thing, and that OTHER THING

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:19.440
But Will just wants him to stop talking about it

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:23.030
Then the group go upstairs to eat a lavish
dinner and talk about their lives

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:26.020
Leaving Will to his thoughts as he remembers
the past:

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.380
he remembers he was at a fifth birthday of some kid

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:41.669
and something happened involving a bat,
a scream, and overall it’s a very confusing

00:07:41.669 --> 00:07:44.500
moment, that’s made worse when he begins to have a panic attack

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:45.450
His anxiety builds up until the moment we see him scream!

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:50.669
and then it cuts to black and then the movie continues.

00:07:50.669 --> 00:07:55.010
So outside, Will stands beside the pool, trying
to make a call when Sadie comes by

00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:56.780
and she offers to have sex with him.

00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:59.020
And if Will wants to be a little rough with her

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:00.020
Go for it.

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:01.020
She likes it rough.

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:04.460
And Will is weirded out by it, and he rejects her offer STERNLY

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:07.010
and tells her to leave him alone and moments later Will

00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:09.950
gets a voice message from Choi and listens
to it.

00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:14.229
In the message, Choi says that he came to
the house early, but realized that he forgot

00:08:14.229 --> 00:08:21.180
dessert and he sent this voice mail to ask
Will to bring cake on his way up.

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:24.419
Choi was here earlier and went into
the house.

00:08:24.419 --> 00:08:27.650
And now Will is sure that something dodgy and weird is going on here.

00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:32.120
And as Will goes back inside, the group sit
at the dinner table as Eden gives Miguel a cake

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:36.060
But now, Will is fuming and he can’t hold
back anymore and he demands to know where

00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:37.750
the F*** is Choi?

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:41.420
Because I just got voice message from him, and Choi
said that he was already here before

00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:45.420
at 7 way before everyone else, what is going on.

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:49.560
But Eden and David both try to reassure him that
Choi wasn't here and they haven't seen him

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:52.960
This just makes Will angrier and he continues
interrogating them:

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:53.920
Something weird is going

00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:56.209
on in this house like Pruitt and Sadie.

00:08:56.209 --> 00:08:56.980
Who are they?

00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:58.200
Why are they here?

00:08:58.209 --> 00:09:00.529
And "The Invitation" video, what was up with that?

00:09:00.529 --> 00:09:03.100
That’s when Will accuses Eden of being in
denial:

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:06.400
Supposedly joining a cult transformed her life?

00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:08.120
That is a lie.

00:09:08.139 --> 00:09:11.170
She is in denial, trying to ignore the fact
that their son.

00:09:11.170 --> 00:09:12.170
Died.

00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:15.949
So this is why Ty was never mentioned or seen around the house: he died.

00:09:15.949 --> 00:09:20.350
That’s why Will has those flashbacks and
from those flashbacks we can figure out what

00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:21.340
happened to Ty:

00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:25.720
that on Ty’s 5th birthday, there was an accident, he was playing with another kid

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:27.839
And Ty got hit by bat

00:09:27.839 --> 00:09:31.260
This is what I was talking about earlier:
This is what Eden and Will have been avoiding

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:32.460
this whole time:

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:35.340
Talking about their son’s death, because the pain is still there

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:38.100
And  they are not over it. Especially Will.

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:41.170
That’s when the doorbell rings and it’s
Choi!

00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:45.199
Turns out he really was here before but never
entered the house because he was called back

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:48.680
to work and left before and that's why he's just arrived now.

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:52.850
And then Will breaks down, apologizing for
what he said and he goes to the bathroom to

00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:53.850
cool his head.

00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:55.709
And he remembers washing Ty’s small hands.

00:09:55.709 --> 00:09:58.699
He can’t stand being inside and so he goes out.

00:09:58.699 --> 00:10:01.759
Where he sits with Kira and he confesses
that he hasn’t gotten over Ty’s death

00:10:01.759 --> 00:10:04.600
and we get a deep look into Will’s mental
state:

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:06.550
He’s broken and suicidal, he can’t

00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:10.000
get over his son’s death, and doesn’t
believe that Eden can just move on and forget their

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.000
son like that.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.320
And when Will goes back inside, he goes to see
Ty’s room, the room that he passed by and

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:16.940
almost went into earlier.

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:19.000
Here inside, the room he remembers Ty

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.100
his toys left on the floor, and as he lies on the bed he remembers

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:26.080
his son’s face, but all of that is now gone.

00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:31.129
And while in this room, Will sees David walking
outside, and lighting a red lantern.

00:10:31.129 --> 00:10:34.360
David seems to be waiting for something, watching
for something.

00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:42.800
Maybe he was wrong, earlier about Choi but
Will’s gut feeling returns.

00:10:42.819 --> 00:10:45.509
There’s something off about tonight’s
dinner.

00:10:45.509 --> 00:10:49.000
Will snoops around until he finds and opens
David’s Laptop, where he sees the rest of

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.119
video: The cult leader is there calling for
his followers to do something on this night,

00:10:53.119 --> 00:11:00.240
ominously saying “Tonight is the night,
our faith is made real”.

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:02.869
Whatever that means, it sounds like something
bad is going to happen.

00:11:02.869 --> 00:11:06.939
So Will goes back upstairs, where the group
is served wine glasses, and Will notices the

00:11:06.939 --> 00:11:09.329
way Eden and David are serving the wine.

00:11:09.329 --> 00:11:10.749
Like they’re excited for something.

00:11:10.749 --> 00:11:15.199
He has a bad feeling about this and just before
they all drink (except for Gina who sneaks

00:11:15.199 --> 00:11:18.810
a sip): Will breaks his glass and knocks the
cup out of everyone’s hands, telling them

00:11:18.810 --> 00:11:20.040
not to drink it.

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:23.410
Sadie gets pissed and attacks Will, screaming
at him “You ruined everything!” only to

00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:26.629
be pushed off by Will, slamming her head into a cupboard.

00:11:26.629 --> 00:11:28.550
And she doesn't get up after that

00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:33.119
This is bad, but it gets worse when Kira notices
Gina, foaming at the mouth.

00:11:33.119 --> 00:11:34.949
She is unresponsive as well

00:11:34.949 --> 00:11:40.079
Miguel rushes to gives her CPR as Ben tries to call
the police but he can’t get reception, and no

00:11:40.079 --> 00:11:44.200
one knows what’s wrong with Gina, and the doors are locked so they can't get out

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:45.810
and as Miguel tries to save her life.

00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:46.850
He’s shot.

00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:47.850
By David.

00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:49.200
Things are getting out of hand

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:53.550
the guests back away from David as Sadie wakes up, and Pruitt is able to calm

00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:56.320
David down and take the gun away from him.

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:59.250
Only to shoot Choi, dead.

00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:04.460
Furious, Tommy tries to attack David only
to get cut by Sadie, as the rest of the group

00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:06.399
runs downstairs and try to leave.

00:12:06.399 --> 00:12:09.100
But the doors are locked and the windows are
barred.

00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:10.330
There’s no way out

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:15.000
Downstairs, Will is attacked by Sadie but
he manages to knock her down and run into

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.120
Eden’s bedroom where he and Kira barricade
the door behind them.

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:22.260
They try to leave through the glass door but
its locked so they’re gonna have to break

00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:23.800
it open but then they hear a noise.

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:26.580
Outside, they see Ben come running out of
the house.

00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:28.779
Only to get killed by David and Pruitt.

00:12:28.779 --> 00:12:32.619
This might be their last chance to escape,
and as Kira and Will sneak out of the bedroom,

00:12:32.619 --> 00:12:34.759
they overhear Eden and David talking.

00:12:34.759 --> 00:12:35.980
Eden is shocked

00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:37.920
It wasn’t supposed to be
like this

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:40.189
everyone was supposed to die peacefully

00:12:40.189 --> 00:12:43.060
from the poisoned wine, so they wouldn’t
have do this.

00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:45.769
and as Eden’s guilt eats away at her, David

00:12:45.769 --> 00:12:48.079
convinces her to join him and kill the rest
of the group.

00:12:48.079 --> 00:12:50.819
It’s the only way they can get over their
pain.

00:12:50.819 --> 00:12:55.250
As David and Eden walk away to hunt them down,
Kira and Will continue sneaking out only to

00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:58.709
spot Sadie bleeding out on the couch, with
a firepoker in her hand.

00:12:58.709 --> 00:13:01.200
Will takes her firepoker and goes upstairs
with Kira.

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:02.869
Because he remembers that there was a door

00:13:02.869 --> 00:13:06.079
to the garage but when they get there it’s
gone.

00:13:06.079 --> 00:13:08.819
Because the house has been remodeled, and now there’s
no way out.

00:13:08.819 --> 00:13:12.352
And to make matters worse, Pruitt is walking
up the stairs, ready to kill them.

00:13:12.352 --> 00:13:14.790
So, Will and Kira hide until just at the right
moment they strike!

00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:19.179
And Pruitt takes a few hits before he sucker
punches Kira, and begins choking out Will

00:13:19.179 --> 00:13:23.129
who is saved by Kira at the last moment who kills Pruitt

00:13:23.129 --> 00:13:27.259
Just as they’re about to leave, Will is
shot by Eden, who frantically apologizes to

00:13:27.259 --> 00:13:28.689
him before she shoots herself.

00:13:28.689 --> 00:13:33.499
That’s when they hear David: walking up
the stairs with a knife in hand, and as David

00:13:33.499 --> 00:13:37.050
is about to reach them, he’s attacked and
killed by Tommy.

00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:39.040
And then someone calls out to Will, it’s
Eden:

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:41.139
Who with her final breath, confesses

00:13:41.139 --> 00:13:45.569
that she never got over Ty’s death, and
asks Will if she can be taken outside where

00:13:45.569 --> 00:13:46.569
she dies.

00:13:46.569 --> 00:13:50.139
So Tommy, Kira, and Will, are the only survivors
of the Reunion.

00:13:50.139 --> 00:13:54.529
It’s over and they’re safe now but Will
sees something, past the Red Lantern that

00:13:54.529 --> 00:14:01.100
David lit, and then we see: across the valley, across Hollywood Hills,
different houses with their own red lanterns

00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:02.739
glowing in the night.

00:14:02.739 --> 00:14:06.949
And Kira and Will can only watch and listen
to the sounds of sirens and screams echoing

00:14:06.949 --> 00:14:08.660
throughout the night

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:11.739
So what just happened?

00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:15.180
Well, if you remember from earlier David lights
a red lantern in his backyard,

00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:18.360
and then looks out into the distance, searching for something.

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:22.120
What is he looking for? He's looking for other red lanterns.

00:14:22.129 --> 00:14:26.709
because earlier in the film, David mentions that there
are thousands of other cult members in the

00:14:26.709 --> 00:14:27.820
LA/NY area

00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:31.959
which explains why all the other houses

00:14:31.959 --> 00:14:35.460
have the red lanterns: they are full of other cult members who are killing their guests

00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:37.480
and are going to kill themselves

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:41.279
It’s kinda sad that so many rich people in
the most expensive real estate properties

00:14:41.279 --> 00:14:44.410
in the US could be so miserable. I guess money doesn't buy you happiness

00:14:44.410 --> 00:14:47.929
Which brings me to my next point: Why
kill people and what does that have to do

00:14:47.929 --> 00:14:49.490
with being free from pain?

00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:52.649
David explains to Eden that killing people is the only way to be free from pain

00:14:52.649 --> 00:14:54.500
but there's more to it than just that

00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:57.720
If you remember from the video, the cult leader tells his followers

00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:00.320
that "tonight is the night, our faith is made real."

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:06.920
What he means by this, is that after tonight:

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:07.860
After the guests are killed and the cult members are dead.

00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:11.960
They will all go to the afterlife where they will reunite with their loved ones

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:15.680
And they will live happily ever after, free from pain, free from sorrow

00:15:15.689 --> 00:15:19.429
Although they were supposed to die together,
which is why Sadie freaks out when Will stopped

00:15:19.429 --> 00:15:21.600
knocks the glasses away from everyone's hands

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:23.960
and this isn’t too far fetched from reality

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:26.249
there have been cases of real life cults doing a kind of similar thing

00:15:26.249 --> 00:15:29.160
like in Jonestown or in Heaven’s
Gate.

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:32.820
And in fact, Dr. Joseph, the cult leader of the Invitation cult,

00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:34.380
kind of looks like the Heaven’s Gate guy.

00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:36.960
Anyways, thank you so much for watching ladies and gentlemen

I have a reunion dinner to attend
