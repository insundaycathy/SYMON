Hi, Israq21 here,

00:00:01.959 --> 00:00:04.841
Today, I will recap a movie called The Hidden Face

00:00:04.841 --> 00:00:13.463
The Hidden Face is a 2011 Colombian thriller film about a woman who could only watch her husband making love with another girl, but she could not do anything.

00:00:13.463 --> 00:00:17.725
OK, what's the continuation of the story? 
watch out and take care,

00:00:17.725 --> 00:00:22.723
This is a spoiler content video, Enjoy the video and let’s start the story,

00:00:26.774 --> 00:00:35.009
The film starts with a confused man named Adrian,
he is confused because he finds a video containing a farewell speech from his wife named Belen.

00:00:35.009 --> 00:00:37.961
And now Belen is missing somewhere,

00:00:37.961 --> 00:00:40.326
and this is the hidden face movie.

00:00:40.326 --> 00:00:46.370
The film continues where Adrian goes to a bar and cries there,
he also drinks until he is very drunk,

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.885
when he get out from bar,
he accidentally bumps into a stranger and fights with him.

00:00:50.885 --> 00:00:54.995
Luckily there was a beautiful barmaid named Fabiana who drove him home.

00:00:54.995 --> 00:00:58.595
Even though they just met,
they immediately did a making love scene,

00:00:58.595 --> 00:01:03.697
Adrian immediately explored Fabiana's cave until she was satisfied.

00:01:03.697 --> 00:01:09.890
Adrian, whose heart is now confused and empty,
finally chooses to move on and date Fabiana,

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:16.175
even he invites Fabiana to stay at his house,
even though the house is owned with Adrian and Belen.

00:01:16.175 --> 00:01:22.224
One morning, Fabiana heard a strange sound from the sink at Adrian's house but she ignored it.

00:01:22.224 --> 00:01:27.967
after that, two police officers arrived who were handling the case of Belen's disappearance.

00:01:27.967 --> 00:01:36.426
However, because Belen's tracks were not detected,
the police suspected that Adrian was the mastermind behind the Belen disappearance case.

00:01:36.426 --> 00:01:40.828
Fabiana feels confused here because the police always come to Adrian’s house,

00:01:40.828 --> 00:01:45.352
but Adrian only says that Belen left because there was another man in her life.

00:01:45.352 --> 00:01:51.658
Fabiana, who has been living at Adrian's house for a few days,
always hears strange sounds when in the bathroom,

00:01:51.658 --> 00:01:56.347
plus the lights suddenly go out which makes Fabiana believe that there is a ghost in the house,

00:01:56.347 --> 00:02:01.060
instantly the lights come back on
and they feel hot so they are making love again.

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.370
When Fabiana was working at the bar,

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:07.389
the police who previously came to Adrian's house turned out to like Fabiana.

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:11.650
The policeman warned Fabiana to be careful with Adrian.

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.950
Then it was seen that Adrian's profession as an orchestra conductor was very cool.

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.896
There Adrian introduced Fabiana to the orchestra manager so they could get to know each other.

00:02:21.896 --> 00:02:26.451
Inside the house, Fabiana felt something odd while taking a shower again,

00:02:26.451 --> 00:02:30.166
where the water that initially felt warm suddenly became very hot.

00:02:30.166 --> 00:02:34.861
He also always heard a strange sound in the sink like the sound of a pipe being hit.

00:02:34.861 --> 00:02:37.144
because Adrian was not at home,

00:02:37.144 --> 00:02:42.767
Fabiana was having fun jumping on the bed, 
suddenly she saw the key in the hole of the room.

00:02:42.767 --> 00:02:45.234
While draping the key around her neck,

00:02:45.234 --> 00:02:50.858
suddenly the lights went out and made Fabiana very scared because like someone else in the house,

00:02:50.858 --> 00:02:57.496
she was suddenly startled by the dog in the house and made Fabiana faint because she got caught on the piano.

00:02:57.496 --> 00:03:05.005
From that incident, Fabiana was sure that the house had a ghost waiting for it,
but here we don't know what the ghost looks like.

00:03:05.005 --> 00:03:11.941
Fabiana also brought Adrian to hear a strange sound in the sink but Adrian thought it was just the wind passing through the drains,

00:03:11.941 --> 00:03:17.813
but Fabiana still insisted that it was a ghost,
so Adrian threatened the ghost by saying,

00:03:22.751 --> 00:03:30.591
Not long after that, Adrian immediately came to the Police Station After receiving news that there was a corpse that looked very much like Belen,

00:03:30.591 --> 00:03:33.724
but again Adrian was disappointed because it was not Belen.

00:03:33.724 --> 00:03:38.125
Adrian went home and told Fabiana that Belen is no longer in my life.

00:03:38.125 --> 00:03:41.546
They hugged in front of the mirror and suddenly this figure appeared.

00:03:45.904 --> 00:03:52.443
The scene suddenly changes to a flashback where Adrian and Belen used to live happily together in a small town in Colombia.

00:03:52.443 --> 00:04:01.279
There Adrian said that he was chosen to be the conductor of an orchestra in the Colombian capital, Bogota, which is quite far from their current city.

00:04:01.279 --> 00:04:06.686
So Adrian asked Belen to come with him so Belen had to leave her job.

00:04:06.686 --> 00:04:15.238
Adrian is known as a young orchestra conductor who has extraordinary talent so that the orchestra manager really likes Adrian's performance.

00:04:15.238 --> 00:04:20.279
in that city, Belen intends to buy a big house that will be occupied with Adrian.

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:25.273
The owner of the house shows every corner of the house that looks luxurious to live in.

00:04:25.273 --> 00:04:30.648
Belen was also given the mandate to look after the dog of the owner of the house while they lived in the house.

00:04:30.648 --> 00:04:32.750
Finally they moved to the new house.

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:39.066
At first their relationship was fine until one day Belen saw Adrian being alone with his coworker named Veronica.

00:04:39.066 --> 00:04:44.263
So to prove whether Adrian is loyal to him,
Belen also checks Adrian's cellphone.

00:04:44.263 --> 00:04:48.718
and it turns out that Adrian often replies to messages and calls with Veronika.

00:04:48.718 --> 00:04:54.150
Seeing Belen sad, Adrian said I was just cursing Veronika,
nothing more than that,

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.918
because my love is only for you, my dear,

00:04:56.918 --> 00:04:58.950
hmm, crocodile.

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:05.652
then Belen asked Adrian to fire Veronica,
but Adrian couldn't do that because he had to be professional at work.

00:05:05.652 --> 00:05:11.091
In order not to be very upset,
Belen also confides in the previous owner of the house.

00:05:11.091 --> 00:05:14.541
The woman advised Belen to test Adrian's loyalty,

00:05:14.541 --> 00:05:22.118
and then the woman showed Belen a Secret Room in her house which was behind the glass where Adrian and Fabiana hugged at the beginning of the movie.

00:05:22.118 --> 00:05:29.810
the room is a soundproof bunker equipped with speakers and two-way glass so you can hear and see whatever is happening outside the room.

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:34.942
The bunker was made by the woman's late husband but because the woman had not been in there for a long time,

00:05:34.942 --> 00:05:39.152
the sink, closet, bed and other facilities were neglected.

00:05:39.152 --> 00:05:44.736
After seeing the room, Belen got an idea to prank Adrian to test his loyalty.

00:05:44.736 --> 00:05:49.740
So Belen made a farewell video to Adrian like the one at the beginning of the movie.

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:55.133
Belen hopes that after Adrian watches the video Adrian immediately looks for Belen.

00:05:55.133 --> 00:06:00.327
so Belen packs her things and puts them in the secret room earlier.

00:06:00.327 --> 00:06:05.207
After Adrian almost came home,
Belen wrote a note and immediately entered the room.

00:06:10.162 --> 00:06:16.131
From inside the room, Belen saw Adrian regretful and sad after watching the video recording,

00:06:16.131 --> 00:06:19.048
Adrian immediately panicked and looked for Belen,

00:06:19.048 --> 00:06:22.204
he also tried to call Belen but couldn't connect,

00:06:22.204 --> 00:06:28.804
inside the room, Belen was very happy because her husband was loyal and worried about her.

00:06:31.709 --> 00:06:35.670
But suddenly everything changed when Belen wanted to end her prank.

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:40.082
It turned out that the key to the room accidentally fell while packing earlier.

00:06:40.082 --> 00:06:45.347
Belen panicked because it turned out that there was no signal at all inside the room,

00:06:45.347 --> 00:06:49.438
Belen also tried to pry on the wall there but failed.

00:06:49.438 --> 00:06:55.319
To survive, Belen is forced to eat raw canned meat and has to drink dirty tap water.

00:06:55.319 --> 00:06:58.747
Now Belen regrets that she has done that prank,

00:06:58.747 --> 00:07:04.207
she is even more sad after hearing that now Adrian has given up looking for Belen.

00:07:04.207 --> 00:07:13.704
Because she was annoyed, Belen accidentally kicked the water pipe which turned out to be able to give a signal to the sink where when the pipe was hit the water moved like that.

00:07:13.704 --> 00:07:19.591
Belen, who was sad because the lights went out,
was made even more sad after seeing a woman,

00:07:19.591 --> 00:07:22.587
Fabiana, who was brought home by Adrian,

00:07:22.587 --> 00:07:27.760
Belen was even more sad because she saw Adrian and Fabiana are making love in front of her,

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:30.376
Damn it really hurts.

00:07:30.376 --> 00:07:34.257
Belen realized here that Adrian was not loyal enough to him.

00:07:34.257 --> 00:07:39.960
Belen, who had been confined there for days,
felt jealous to see Fabiana jumping on the bed.

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:44.812
but suddenly Belen was happy because she saw Fabiana found the key to the Secret Room.

00:07:44.812 --> 00:07:51.116
Fabiana who was curious about the noises in the sink thought that it was Belen who was confined in a room.

00:07:51.116 --> 00:07:58.712
Fabiana also spoke and asked in front of the sink which was then answered by Belen by hitting the water pipe as a sign that Belen was still alive.

00:07:58.712 --> 00:08:05.299
Fabiana also saw that the dog kept barking in front of the mirror so Fabiana tried to flip the mirror but she couldn't do it.

00:08:05.299 --> 00:08:10.141
Suddenly Fabiana ruffled the bookshelf beside the mirror and found a keyhole.

00:08:10.141 --> 00:08:19.023
At first, Fabiana wanted to open it,
but she changed her mind because if it was opened,
Adrian would definitely come back with Belen.

00:08:19.023 --> 00:08:24.750
So Fabiana left Belen locked up, because she was already in love with Adrian.

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:30.150
so that Adrian doesn't know the Secret Room,
Fabiana changes the arrangement of their rooms.

00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:36.601
after work, Fabiana tries to communicate with Belen again,
but unfortunately no answer from Belen.

00:08:36.601 --> 00:08:41.855
Fabiana started to worry and asked about Belen's condition through a letter.

00:08:41.855 --> 00:08:48.812
The next day, the police who liked Fabiana came and gave a photo of Adrian's affair with Veronika at work.

00:08:48.812 --> 00:08:55.982
But at the same time, Adrian ended his relationship with Veronica because he wanted to start a new life with Fabiana.

00:08:55.982 --> 00:09:04.940
Back to Fabiana, Fabiana, who felt sorry for Belen because she didn't get an answer yesterday, finally decided to open the Secret Room.

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:07.954
There she saw Belen lying weakly on the bed

00:09:07.954 --> 00:09:17.167
then Fabiana woke Belen gently but Belen, who had a grudge with Fabiana, hit Fabiana and locked Fabiana in the secret room.

00:09:17.167 --> 00:09:20.827
Now Adrian went home,
but Belen was not there,

00:09:20.827 --> 00:09:26.047
she just left the key on the bed and a photo of the two of them in the mirror of the secret room.

00:09:26.047 --> 00:09:32.119
Meanwhile, Belen decided to leave Adrian's life because she knows that adrian is not loyal to her.

00:09:32.119 --> 00:09:33.981
and the movie of the hidden face is,

00:09:39.646 --> 00:09:42.574
over

00:09:42.574 --> 00:09:45.778
