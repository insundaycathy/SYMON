00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.709
Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:07.130
Today, I'm going to explain an action, adventure,
drama film called "Battle Royale."

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:08.580
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:09.990
Watch out and take care.

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.710
Due to a major recession, the Japanese totalitarian
government passed a program to minimize juvenile

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:17.520
delinquency known as The B.R.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:18.520
Act.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.840
The act requires the government to randomly
select a class of high school students to

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.800
engage in a battle to the death inside an
arena.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.580
The last one to survive wins the game.

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:32.119
Last year, various people from the media flocked
as the army transports a bloodied girl, the

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.879
winner, wearing a high school uniform, who
smiles menacingly.

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:41.300
A high school student, Shuya, recounts how
his mother left him and how he found his father

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.210
hanging in their apartment.

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:50.620
One day, his best friend, Nobu, wounds a teacher,
Kitano, which leads to him resigning.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.420
A year later, Shuya's class is taken on a
field trip.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:02.190
On the bus, Megumi encourages her best friend,
Noriko, to give her homemade cookies to Shuya.

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.260
Shuya accepts it awkwardly but gives it to
Nobu.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:06.859
The bus enters a tunnel.

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:10.659
Shuya wakes up and sees his classmates and
teacher are all asleep.

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:13.450
The bus driver and conductress wear gas masks.

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.020
The conductress finds him and knocks him out.

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.500
Shuya and his class wake up in a dark classroom
with metal collars on their necks.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:27.210
The students get up and back away in fear
of two unknown students, Kawada and Kiriyama.

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.259
The class watches as a helicopter lands on
the abandoned school with dozens of soldiers

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.259
waiting.

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:36.659
Their previous teacher, Kitano, hops off the
helicopter and heads to the classroom.

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.520
The class is surprised to see their former
teacher, who asks them if they are familiar

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:41.640
with the B.R.

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.640
Act.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.530
When he doesn't get an answer, Kitano turns
to Nobu and uses him and his lack of discipline

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.159
to explain why the B.R. act exists.

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:54.119
He announces the Battle Royale, where the
class must battle until only one of them survives.

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:59.130
Seeing the class in disbelief, Kitano presents
the body of their teacher, Mr. Hayashida,

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.079
who pleaded for his class to be released.

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.880
The students scream in fear, realizing the
seriousness of their situation.

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.250
Kitano plays the video explaining the mechanics
of Battle Royale.

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.440
The host congratulates the class for being
chosen for this year's Battle Royale and informs

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.379
them that they are on a remote island.

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:19.730
Kitano spots students whispering and throws
a knife, hitting a student on the head.

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.860
The rest scream and attempt to escape, but
soldiers fire warning shots to make them back

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:24.940
away.

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.140
Noriko gets hit on the arm, angering Nobu,
who jumps on Kitano.

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.890
But Kitano slices him on the leg while another
soldier punches him.

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.400
Unfazed, Kitano sways the soldiers away and
resumes the video.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.550
The video explains that the island is divided
into zones.

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:45.200
Every day, Kitano will announce danger zones
where, if the students are in there at a given

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.150
time, their collars will explode.

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.709
The collars, which act as a locator and heart
monitor, will also explode if they are tampered

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:52.930
with.

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.250
This drives Nobu to the edge, yelling at Kitano.

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.989
Another student, Motobuchi, tells him to be
quiet so they can focus on the video.

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:03.739
Nobu fights him until soldiers pull them away.

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:07.140
Kitano grabs a remote, and Nobu's collar starts
beeping.

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.040
The students avoid him as Nobu begs for help.

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.780
Shuya watches as Nobu's collar explodes.

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.230
Shuya mourns for his friend, picking up the
polaroid that they took at the bus earlier.

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.250
Red with anger and grief, Shuya rushes to
Kitano but is held back by his classmates.

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.841
The video continues to explain how, if there's
more than one survivor after three days, all

00:03:26.841 --> 00:03:29.890
the collars will detonate, leaving no survivors.

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.150
The sole winner will be allowed to go home.

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.819
Another student, Mimura, asks how they were
chosen.

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:38.560
Kitano answers that it was a random selection.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.840
Mimura asks why the government is doing this;
Kitano blames the students' disobedience.

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:49.390
Soldiers bring in multiple supply bags, each
containing food, water, a map, a compass,

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.069
a flashlight, and a random weapon.

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:55.870
One by one, the students are called and given
a bag before leaving the building.

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.879
A heavy boy named Yoshio is called first.

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:06.280
One of the girls, Sakura, defiantly throws
back the supply bag given to her before leaving.

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.700
After already leaving the classroom, Kawada
comes back, pushing Kiriyama before demanding

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.530
a different bag.

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:16.780
When Shuya is called, he gives the polaroid
to Noriko, telling her that he'll wait for

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:17.780
her.

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.790
Shuya leaves the building and hides in a bush
to inspect his bag.

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:25.970
He's interrupted by Tendo, who has an arrow
sticking out of her neck.

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:30.100
She collapses as someone from afar continues
to fire arrows at her.

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.600
Shuya looks up and sees Yoshio with a crossbow.

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.220
Shuya throws his flashlight on his face before
running with Noriko.

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.250
Yoshio tumbles down, losing his crossbow.

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.780
He fumbles around when Kazushi approaches,
holding his crossbow.

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:47.310
Yoshio rushes towards him, making Kazushi
panic and pull the trigger.

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.910
Near the island's shore, Shuya and Noriko
find a cave to hide.

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:55.330
Shuya checks Noriko's injured arm, glad to
see that the bullet only grazed her.

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:59.250
In their bags, they find a pot lid and binoculars
as their weapons.

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:03.320
Shuya wonders if their class can escape the
island, but Noriko doesn't trust the others

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:06.720
anymore, given that they bullied her before
the events.

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.950
When Noriko brings up Nobu, Shuya recalls
being in the foster home with him.

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:15.500
At the time, Nobu had been ditching school
until Noriko wrote to him, asking him to come

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.260
back and join the school trip.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:21.780
With everything that happened, Noriko regrets
inviting Nobu back, but Shuya doesn't blame

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:22.840
her.

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.640
Students corner Kiriyama by the shore, mocking
the paper fan he got as a weapon.

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:30.890
With him not being a part of the class, the
students wonder if Kiriyama is a spy for Kitano.

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:35.210
A student aims a gun at his head, allowing
Kiriyama to steal the gun and shoot them.

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:38.100
In less than a minute, Kiriyama takes down
several students.

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:42.190
Victorious, he walks over their corpses and
takes a gun and two grenades from them.

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:46.490
At the edge of a cliff, Sakura throws her
bag into the ocean, declaring that she doesn't

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:48.050
want to be part of the game.

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:52.490
Her boyfriend, Kazuhiko, mourns the hopelessness
of their situation.

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:55.280
The two hold each other before jumping off
the cliff to escape the nightmare.

00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:00.660
In a storage room, Megumi looks through the
polaroids she took of her classmates.

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:03.690
Someone enters, and she quickly grabs her
stun gun.

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:09.820
Mitsuko reveals herself, and Megumi allows
her to come in, thinking that they can be

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:10.820
allies.

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:13.790
Mitsuko snoops on Megumi’s polaroids before
taking her stun gun.

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:17.430
She lunges after Megumi and tackles her down,
holding a sickle to her neck.

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:24.250
Mitsuko tells her about two classmates, Yoji
and Yoshimi, who hung themselves next door.

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:28.020
Mitsuko declares that she refuses to lose
like them before slashing Megumi's neck.

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:32.330
On the following day, Shuya and Noriko listen
to Kitano's announcement.

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:37.050
When Kitano announces Megumi as one of the
fallen students, Noriko freezes.

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:42.080
Kitano lists the danger zones and their schedules,
prompting Shuya and Noriko to take notes on

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.080
their maps.

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:47.091
Noriko is still shaken that her friend is
gone, but Shuya pushes her to move, seeing

00:06:47.091 --> 00:06:49.330
that they're in a danger zone.

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:53.360
While running, Oki ambushes them with a hatchet.

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:56.990
Shuya throws his bag to his face and allows
Noriko to escape.

00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:00.640
He uses his potlid as a shield, effectively
blocking Oki’s attacks.

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:03.360
Oki jumps for him, causing them to fall down
the hill.

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:06.830
When Shuya rolls away, he watches Oki struggle
with his head wound.

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:11.650
Oki had accidentally plunged the hatchet on
his own head, bleeding severely before collapsing.

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:15.240
Seeing his classmate gone, Shuya panics in
guilt and fear.

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:18.400
They're interrupted by Motobuchi firing a
gun at them.

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:23.230
The nervous Motobuchi stammers while holding
them at gunpoint, allowing Kawada to shoot

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:24.230
him.

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:28.420
Kawada takes Mitobuchi's gun and asks Shuya
and Noriko what weapons they have.

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:32.170
When they show the pot lid and binoculars,
he takes Oki's hatchet.

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:35.460
The trio hears two girls asking everyone to
a ceasefire.

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:41.340
Through her binoculars, Noriko sees Yumiko
and Yukiko.

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:45.640
Shuya wants to go to them and help, but Kawada
stops him, warning him that other dangerous

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:47.900
classmates will come after the two girls.

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:51.830
Kawada fires a warning shot, making the two
girls hide.

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:54.840
Shuya yells for the girls to run, but it's
too late.

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:59.580
The girls are gunned down from behind by Kiriyama,
who aims the megaphone at Yumiko's lips before

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:03.780
firing at her again, making her screams echo
over the distance.

00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:08.110
Shuya is angry and in disbelief at how his
classmates can fight each other.

00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:11.330
Kawada tells him the only way out of this
is to end their own lives.

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:13.020
If they can't, then they should run.

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:18.590
Later that day, Mitsuko heads to a shed to
hide but is held at gunpoint by Hirono.

00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:22.760
Hirono takes her sickle before throwing it
back at her, accusing her of executing Megumi.

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:25.730
Mitsuko begs for her life, letting Hirono
kick her down.

00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:30.010
While Hirono spouts accusations at her, Mitsuko
grabs Megumi's stun gun from her bag and electrocutes

00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:31.510
her before stealing the gun.

00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:34.740
Hirono tries to run, but Mitsuko shoots her
on the back.

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:38.599
Heading to another safe zone, Noriko collapses
due to a fever.

00:08:38.599 --> 00:08:43.439
Shuya carries her to a nearby clinic but trips
a wire, alerting Kawada inside.

00:08:43.439 --> 00:08:48.180
Kawada helps them, giving Noriko medicine
and preparing a meal for them.

00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:57.750
Sugimura finds his classmates, Mimura, Seto,
and Iijima, fixing Mimura's laptop in an abandoned

00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:58.750
building.

00:08:58.750 --> 00:09:03.300
Sugimura shows his weapon, a tracking device
for the collars, and asks if they've seen

00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:06.130
Chigusa and Kotohiki, but they haven't.

00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:10.019
Mimura tells him that they're looking for
a way to escape, but Sugimura is more interested

00:09:10.019 --> 00:09:12.060
in saving the two girls.

00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:16.089
Mimura asks him to tell Shuya where they are
if Sugimura finds him.

00:09:16.089 --> 00:09:19.650
When Sugimura leaves, Mimura notices something
on the collar.

00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:22.640
He notifies the others that the collars are
bugged.

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:28.560
In another part of the island, Chigusa jogs,
imagining Sugimura behind her.

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:32.730
When she snaps out of it, she takes a break,
wondering where her friend is.

00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:37.730
Niida walks up to her, begging her to stay
with him, but she is disgusted by him after

00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:39.500
he spread rumors about them.

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:42.829
Niida threatens to fire his crossbow at her,
then confesses his love for her.

00:09:42.829 --> 00:09:46.569
He insults Sugimura for not making a move
on her, and this pisses her off.

00:09:46.569 --> 00:09:50.029
Afraid, Niida fires his crossbow, slicing
her cheek.

00:09:50.029 --> 00:09:53.769
With widened eyes, she mocks Niida for blaming
everyone for his own weaknesses.

00:09:53.769 --> 00:09:57.550
Without removing her eyes from him, she takes
her swiss knife and challenges him.

00:09:57.550 --> 00:10:01.029
Frightened by her anger, Niida runs away,
and Chigusa gives chase.

00:10:01.029 --> 00:10:03.680
She slashes at his back and stabs him repeatedly.

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:06.519
Before she can take a breath, Mitsuko appears
and shoots her.

00:10:06.519 --> 00:10:09.410
Chigusa quickly runs away but is hit on the
stomach.

00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:12.540
Chigusa collapses on a dam, struggling with
her injuries.

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:15.470
Sugimura finds her, encouraging her to hang
on.

00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:18.519
She tells him it was Mitsuko who got her,
warning him to watch out.

00:10:18.519 --> 00:10:21.930
Sugimura lets Chigusa rest on his shoulders
as she asks about his feelings.

00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:25.839
Chigusa confirms that Sugimura isn't in love
with her but is still happy to die in his

00:10:25.839 --> 00:10:26.839
arms.

00:10:26.839 --> 00:10:30.189
Sugimura mourns for his best friend, staying
with her after she passes away.

00:10:30.189 --> 00:10:34.749
Back at the school, Kitano paints a picture
of the students before making his announcements.

00:10:34.749 --> 00:10:38.770
He's disappointed at the slow pace of the
killings, adding more danger zones as punishment

00:10:38.770 --> 00:10:40.040
for the students.

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:44.450
That evening, Noriko and Shuya enjoy their
meal, thanking Kawada for helping them.

00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:47.199
Kawada reveals that he is a survivor of a
previous Battle Royale.

00:10:47.199 --> 00:10:51.670
He and his crush, Keiko, were the last two
standing.

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:54.199
When their collars start beeping, Keiko shoots
him.

00:10:54.199 --> 00:10:57.640
In reflex, Kawada shoots back in self-defense,
mortally wounding her.

00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:00.060
Before she died, Keiko smiled and thanked
him.

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:02.980
The officials drugged Kawada and took him
to this year’s Battle Royale to shake things

00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:04.290
up.

00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:07.630
Realizing this, he vowed to get revenge and
to understand Keiko’s last words.

00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:12.569
Kawada claims that he knows how to escape
the island but doesn't reveal how just yet.

00:11:12.569 --> 00:11:15.480
He gives Shuya a gun as a sign of alliance.

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:18.959
Gunshots come from outside, and the trio duck
for cover.

00:11:18.959 --> 00:11:23.180
Kawada says it's Kiriyama, who voluntarily
signed up for the battle.

00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:26.819
Kawada tells Shuya to meet him at the shrine
in case they have to split up.

00:11:26.819 --> 00:11:32.579
Outside, Kiriyama is chasing after Oda until
they reach the clinic.

00:11:32.579 --> 00:11:35.360
Kiriyama finally corners Oda and shoots him
down.

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:39.379
Thinking that Kiriyama is gone, Oda celebrates,
revealing his bulletproof vest.

00:11:39.379 --> 00:11:42.980
Kiriyama appears above him, then uses a sword
to take him down.

00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:46.189
Hearing something from the clinic, Kiriyama
throws Oda's severed head against the window

00:11:46.189 --> 00:11:48.139
with a grenade in his mouth.

00:11:48.139 --> 00:11:51.360
The trio runs just before the grenade explodes.

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:54.790
Kiriyama starts firing inside the clinic,
trapping them inside.

00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:57.779
Kawada keeps a protective arm around Noriko
while Shuya is cornered on the other side

00:11:57.779 --> 00:11:58.959
of the room.

00:11:58.959 --> 00:12:03.290
Shuya tells Kawada to protect Noriko before
jumping out to lead Kiriyama.

00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:04.860
Sugimura wakes up, hearing gunshots.

00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:08.230
He checks his tracker, locating where the
two are heading.

00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:10.640
Kiriyama corners Shuya but runs out of bullets.

00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:14.699
As Kiriyama loads more bullets, Shuya fires
at him, but he remains unfazed.

00:12:14.699 --> 00:12:16.850
Shuya jumps into the water to escape.

00:12:16.850 --> 00:12:20.350
Kiriyama frantically shoots the water, but
Sugimura tackles him before following Shuya

00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:21.760
into the water.

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:26.230
Back at the building, Seto and Iijima bring
the supplies that Mimura requested.

00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:30.579
While covering the mic on his collar, Mimura
reveals his plan to fight against the officials

00:12:30.579 --> 00:12:32.649
and escape with his friends.

00:12:32.649 --> 00:12:38.699
On the next day, Shuya wakes up in the lighthouse,
where Utsumi explains how Sugimura carried

00:12:38.699 --> 00:12:40.329
him to the lighthouse before leaving.

00:12:40.329 --> 00:12:43.870
Utsumi assures him that Kawada and Noriko
are still alive.

00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:48.629
The morning report only listed the dead as
Oda and best friends Mizuho and Kaori, who

00:12:48.629 --> 00:12:51.079
seemed to have fought each other over a life
preserver.

00:12:51.079 --> 00:12:54.880
The noon report listed Takiguchi and Hatagami,
who were killed by Mitsuko.

00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:58.809
Utsumi also gives him Sugimura's message that
Mimura is waiting for him.

00:12:58.809 --> 00:13:01.550
Shuya tells her that Kawada has a way to escape
the island.

00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:06.370
However, Utsumi, who’s smitten with him,
insists that he stays with them while he heals.

00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:11.529
In the kitchen, Sakaki, who witnessed Oki
and Shuya's fight before, holds a bottle of

00:13:11.529 --> 00:13:13.589
poison while she thinks of what she saw.

00:13:13.589 --> 00:13:17.600
Utsumi assures her that Shuya isn't dangerous
and that Oki's death was an accident.

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:23.360
Despite the others' upbeat mood, Noda reminds
them that tomorrow might be their last day.

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:27.389
Sakaki offers to serve Shuya's meal but poisons
the dish.

00:13:27.389 --> 00:13:31.140
Another girl, Nakagawa, enters and takes the
dish from Sakaki.

00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:35.760
Sakaki backs away as Nakagawa eats the poisoned
meal.

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:39.600
Utsumi tells the girls that Kawada may have
a way to escape the island.

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:43.329
The news brings them hope until Nakagawa starts
vomiting blood.

00:13:43.329 --> 00:13:47.649
Panicked, Noda takes a gun, demanding who
poisoned their meal.

00:13:47.649 --> 00:13:51.149
The girls point fingers at each other, which
causes Noda to open fire.

00:13:51.149 --> 00:13:55.439
With their trust broken, the girls shoot at
each other until Sakaki is the only one left.

00:13:55.439 --> 00:13:57.450
Hearing Shuya, Sakaki opens the door for him.

00:13:57.450 --> 00:14:00.129
She apologizes to him before running away.

00:14:00.129 --> 00:14:03.680
Shuya sees his fallen classmates, distraught
and confused at the chaos.

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:06.579
He heads up the lighthouse and finds that
Sakaki has jumped off.

00:14:06.579 --> 00:14:10.850
At the shrine, Noriko dreams about having
ice cream with Kitano, who’s still her teacher.

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:13.399
She tells Kawada the dream, who thinks it’s
scary.

00:14:13.399 --> 00:14:16.089
But she comments that Kitano seemed lonely
instead.

00:14:16.089 --> 00:14:19.399
In the control room, Kitano is woken up by
his daughter's call.

00:14:19.399 --> 00:14:23.149
His family doesn't know his involvement with
the B.R. act but doesn't care where he is.

00:14:23.149 --> 00:14:25.619
His daughter insults him before dropping the
call.

00:14:25.619 --> 00:14:28.759
In the woods, Shuya struggles to move with
his injuries.

00:14:28.759 --> 00:14:33.649
He remembers his father and Nobu, which gives
him the drive to move forward.

00:14:33.649 --> 00:14:37.319
When it rains, Noriko heads out, hoping to
find Shuya.

00:14:37.319 --> 00:14:41.470
Instead, she finds Mitsuko, who aims a gun
at her, mocking her for being protected by

00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:42.470
two men.

00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:45.329
But Mitsuko runs away, seeing Kitano in the
woods.

00:14:45.329 --> 00:14:48.920
Shuya finally arrives, collapsing in front
of Noriko, who goes to help him.

00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:51.999
Kitano offers his umbrella to Noriko and leaves.

00:14:51.999 --> 00:14:57.629
At a warehouse, Sugimura finally tracks down
Kotohiki, but she hides from him, not knowing

00:14:57.629 --> 00:14:58.629
his intentions.

00:14:58.629 --> 00:15:02.490
In panic, Kotohiki shoots him when he runs
to her until she’s out of bullets.

00:15:02.490 --> 00:15:05.980
In pain, Sugimura warns that she should run
as someone may have heard the gunshots.

00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:10.540
Confused, Kotohiki goes closer to him, demanding
why he still cares after she shot him.

00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:13.089
With his last breath, he confesses his love
for her.

00:15:13.089 --> 00:15:15.810
Kotohiki mourns, not having known his affections
for her.

00:15:15.810 --> 00:15:19.750
Suddenly, Mitsuko arrives and shoots her,
killing her instantly.

00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:22.680
Before she could walk away, Kiriyama fires
at Mitsuko.

00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:24.879
Thinking she’s dead, he takes her gun and
walks away.

00:15:24.879 --> 00:15:28.619
Mistuko’s eyes open, using her stun gun
to disable him.

00:15:28.619 --> 00:15:32.170
She swings her sickle at him, but his bulletproof
vest protects him from the slices.

00:15:32.170 --> 00:15:34.470
He kicks her off before gunning her down.

00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:37.930
At sunset, Shuya hears that Sugimura is gone.

00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:41.860
He decides to follow Sugimura's message and
go to Mimura.

00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:45.959
At the building, Mimura hacks the school's
security system while Seto and Iijima prepare

00:15:45.959 --> 00:15:47.509
the bombs.

00:15:47.509 --> 00:15:51.790
Mimura disconnects the officials from the
collars and disables the danger zones.

00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:54.399
The soldiers panic as the virus hacks their
system.

00:15:54.399 --> 00:15:57.910
Kitano walks to the fuse box and shuts the
power down, ordering the men to restart the

00:15:57.910 --> 00:15:58.910
system.

00:15:58.910 --> 00:16:02.929
Mimura and his friends load up the explosives
in a truck to take to the school, but Iijima

00:16:02.929 --> 00:16:04.889
spots someone in the woods.

00:16:04.889 --> 00:16:09.129
Thinking it's Shuya, Seto calls out, but Kiriyama
fires at him.

00:16:09.129 --> 00:16:11.580
Mimura fights back but runs out of bullets.

00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:15.360
He and Iijima try to flee, but Iijima is gunned
down, angering Mimura.

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:18.190
With his friends gone, Mimura has nothing
left to lose.

00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:22.119
He climbs up the truck and triggers the explosive
just as Shuya and the rest arrive.

00:16:22.119 --> 00:16:26.139
The trio stares at the catastrophe in disbelief,
hoping for their friends to come out alive.

00:16:26.139 --> 00:16:29.959
Instead, Kiriyama walks away from the burning
building but doesn’t pursue them.

00:16:29.959 --> 00:16:33.089
Kawada walks up to Kiriyama slowly, readying
his gun.

00:16:33.089 --> 00:16:36.730
Kiriyama hears him, turning to reveal that
he’s been blinded by the explosion.

00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:40.689
Kiriyama shoots blindly, hitting Kawada on
the shoulder before Kawada fires back, causing

00:16:40.689 --> 00:16:42.100
him to collapse.

00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:44.999
Kawada shoots Kiriyama’s collar, making
it explode.

00:16:44.999 --> 00:16:48.679
With only the three left, they head to the
shore, where Kawada aims his gun at the two.

00:16:48.679 --> 00:16:51.499
He reveals that he's been pretending to be
on their side.

00:16:51.499 --> 00:16:55.720
Kitano hears Kawada fire his gun, announcing
that the battle is over.

00:16:55.720 --> 00:17:00.110
That afternoon, the soldiers retreat, leaving
Kitano alone in the school.

00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:03.529
Kitano exercises at the school ground, enjoying
the peace of being alone.

00:17:03.529 --> 00:17:05.970
Kawada arrives, revealing that he’s unarmed.

00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:10.400
Kitano brings him inside and confirms that
Kawada's collar no longer works.

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:14.860
Kitano accuses him of cheating by disabling
the collars, pointing a gun at him.

00:17:14.860 --> 00:17:18.640
Shuya and Noriko enter, holding Kitano at
gunpoint.

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:21.020
Kitano is not surprised to see them.

00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:25.910
He reveals his painting of the students' battle,
with a smiling Noriko as the sole survivor.

00:17:25.910 --> 00:17:29.541
The students are horrified at the image, with
Kitano revealing that he wanted Noriko, the

00:17:29.541 --> 00:17:32.080
only student he liked, to win the game from
the beginning.

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:36.790
He tells Noriko to shoot him, but Shuya does
it instead, sparing Noriko.

00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:40.110
Kitano reveals that his gun is a toy before
collapsing.

00:17:40.110 --> 00:17:42.820
Knowing that the game is over, the trio removes
their collars.

00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:46.340
A phone rings nearby, and they're surprised
to see Kitano get up and answer his daughter's

00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:47.580
call.

00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:50.070
He argues with her before shooting the phone.

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:53.700
He takes the last cookie from Noriko's gift,
then passes away.

00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:56.420
The students take a boat to leave the island.

00:17:56.420 --> 00:18:00.420
Kawada tells the two that he finally understands
why Keiko thanked him in the end before passing

00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:01.770
away.

00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:07.040
When they reach the city, Shuya and Noriko
become fugitives for escaping Battle Royale.

00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:19.040
The two are determined to survive, despite
having to run for the rest of their lives.
