Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:06.089
Today I'm going to explain a fantasy, horror,
and musical film called “Good Manners."

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:07.329
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:07.329 --> 00:00:09.129
Watch out and take care.&nbsp;

00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:11.480
&nbsp;
On the way to a job interview, Clara Macedo,

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.870
a young woman applying to be a nanny, arrives
at the job site where strict security measures

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:16.870
are done.

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:22.160
The employer, Ana, welcomes her into her home,
making her wait because she is still interviewing

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.440
another nanny.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.130
While waiting, Clara observes the beautiful
space overlooking other buildings.

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.340
During the interview, Clara says that she
used to be a student nurse but is inexperienced

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:31.539
in being a nanny.

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:35.820
However, she informs Ana that she used to
take care of her grandmother for seven years.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.260
Just as she is about to be denied the job
because of her lack of references, Ana experiences

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.150
cramping because of her pregnancy.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.059
To ease her pain, Clara guides and positions
her body so she could feel relieved.

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.750
Impressed by this, Ana decides to hire her
as a housekeeper and a future nanny, so she

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.739
tours her around the house.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:52.190
&nbsp;
Clara comes home on that rainy night to gather

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.469
her things before moving to Ana’s place.

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:59.329
However, she discovers that Doña Amelia,
her landlady, got all her clothes because

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:01.590
she failed to pay her rent for the past months.

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.839
She refuses to give Clara her clothes unless
she pays all her debts.

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:07.930
Finally, they both come to an agreement that
settles their deal.

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.960
On the first day of her job, she arrives at
the messy house and cleans it right away.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.870
Inside Ana’s bedroom, she sees a revolver
but isn’t bothered by it at all.&nbsp;

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:17.780
&nbsp;
The following day, Clara accompanies Ana for

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.280
her ultrasound appointment, where she finds
out that she is having a baby boy.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.520
She is concerned about the baby’s normalcy,
but the doctor assures her that the baby is

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.200
perfectly healthy and even overweight for
his age.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.200
Back in the house, Clara paints the room blue
and customizes it for the baby’s gender.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.040
While cleaning up, she hears loud music from
the living room as Ana celebrates her 29th

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.040
birthday.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.000
Seeing that she is drinking liquor, Clara
attempts to stop her, but she insists that

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.880
it is a special occasion and invites Clara
to celebrate.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.170
They both share a toast, and the drunk Ana
shares that she is estranged from her family

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:46.810
after cutting ties with her.

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.810
She then shows a picture of her on the farm
and says that she has always been fascinated

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.159
with animal eyes.

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:54.829
Initially engaged to a rich man, she had another
affair and conceived a child from another

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:55.829
man.

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.030
Her parents sent her away to the city to get
rid of the baby, but they severed ties after

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.960
refusing to undergo the process.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.399
Ana becomes extremely comfortable with Clara
and forms an unexpected friendship with her.&nbsp;

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.290
&nbsp;
On her 28th week of pregnancy, the doctor

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.370
informs her that her blood pressure is increasing,
thus prescribing her a new diet.

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.840
According to him, it will be difficult at
first, but she will indeed feel better after

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.930
a while, emphasizing that she should cut out
her meat intake.

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.629
Clara clears the fridge at home and replaces
it with fresh produce to follow the doctor’s

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:22.629
instructions.

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:25.590
She also monitors her boss’s health to ensure
her prime pregnancy.

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.900
She kindly gives Ana a book about baby names
to make her decision easier, which Ana is

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.479
grateful for.&nbsp;

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:32.389
&nbsp;
That night, Clara visits a nearby bar to spend

00:02:32.389 --> 00:02:33.469
her free night.

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:38.930
A woman named Gilda joins her table, but she
is not keen on talking to anyone at the moment.

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.510
It is clear that Gilda is attracted to Clara,
so she invites her to party with her friends

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.090
at another table, but she respectfully declines.

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.139
Still determined, she gives Clara her contact
number on a piece of napkin, which makes Clara

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:50.139
blush.

00:02:50.139 --> 00:02:53.959
Back home, Clara hears noises from the kitchen
and checks to see if Ana needs anything.

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:57.810
She sees her standing by the fridge, a bit
disoriented as if she is craving for something.

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.659
Oddly, Ana starts sniffing Clara from her
shoulder up, and not long after that, they

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:03.459
start to share a steamy kiss.

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:07.430
Out of nowhere, Clara pushes Ana away after
realizing that Ana has scratched and bit her

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.069
too hard to draw blood.

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:12.569
The following day, Ana completely forgets
what happened the night before, and tells

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:16.199
Clara that she just had a weird dream, and
even asks Clara what time she got back from

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:17.209
the bar.

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:20.439
Out of nowhere, she utters the name “Joel”
and lets Clara know that she has chosen a

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:22.249
name for her baby boy.

00:03:22.249 --> 00:03:26.219
Not long after, Clara informs that Ana suffers
some kind of sleepwalking disorder which puzzles

00:03:26.219 --> 00:03:28.539
her, having no idea that she gets up at night
unknowingly.&nbsp;

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:31.709
&nbsp;
Clara is in charge of tracking Ana’s pregnancy—she

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.879
takes notes of her blood pressure and behavior
throughout the days in a calendar that displays

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:36.389
phases of the moon.

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:40.150
She notices that Ana acts weird or sickly
on the occurrence of a full moon.

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.720
Moments later, she hears Ana from the room
having a nightmare, so she comes to her for

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:44.720
comfort.

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.299
As Clara holds her, they feel a sense of intimacy
and end up making love to each other.

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:52.019
When both of them are lying down, Ana awakens
out of nowhere, with her eyes entirely in

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:55.010
a different color, and she makes her way outside
the apartment.

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.359
Clara curiously follows her around the city,
ending up in a bus station where she sees

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:00.980
Ana eating a cat after murdering it.

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.370
The following day, Ana goes about her day
as if nothing happened and dances happily

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.739
in the living room, which confuses Clara.

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:09.969
While preparing Ana’s meal, she puts some
of her blood into the food, thinking that

00:04:09.969 --> 00:04:12.559
it would relieve her sleepwalking and thirst
for blood.

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:15.829
After Ana delightfully finishes her food,
Clara lets her know about her sleepwalking

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:17.620
and the scratches she put on her.

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.670
Ana falls silent and blames everything on
her pregnancy while breaking into tears.

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:25.620
That night, they test their theory and spread
flour on the floor to see if she sleepwalks;

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.699
Ana falls asleep soundly, thus confirming
that it only happens during a full moon.&nbsp;

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:31.620
&nbsp;
Their relationship is becoming more serious,

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.900
and both of them continue to live as a couple.

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.370
Because Ana now lacks the money to make ends
meet, she lets Clara remove gemstones from

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.210
one of her expensive boots so she could trade
it for some money.

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:43.840
That night, they talk about farm animals and
if Ana has experienced killing one, and she

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.560
shares about her last kill.

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.979
It was during a holiday; she went out on her
own and ended up in a bar where she met Jorge

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:53.530
Mario, a random guy from the bar and the one
she had an affair with.

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:56.139
They drove to a hill that night and had an
intimate moment.

00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:59.990
Not long after, Ana was awoken by a growl
and saw a wolf like-figure just outside the

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:01.300
passenger seat.

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.409
She grabs her revolver and tries to shoot
it, but the beast only stares at her before

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:06.110
running off into the woods.

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:09.310
She describes the creature by saying that
it has shiny eyes and a look of anger.

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:13.610
Since then, she never saw Jorge Mario again
despite looking for him in that town.

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:15.500
According to the locals, they know no one
of that name.&nbsp;

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.240
&nbsp;
On the next schedule of her ultrasound, the

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.110
doctor says that the baby has big eyes, big
hands, and a big mouth, but the pregnancy

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:24.150
is normal as far as they are concerned.

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:27.889
The doctor prescribed some medicine for her
and reminded Clara not to feed her any meat.

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:31.789
However, Ana seems disoriented and worried,
even until they get home.

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:35.300
While Clara fixes her hair, Ana tells her
that she has an intense craving for pine nuts

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.800
at that hour, saying that she won’t be able
to sleep if she doesn’t eat some.

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.830
Hesitant to leave Ana alone in the house,
Clara goes anyway after Ana’s pleas.

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:46.289
Shortly afterward, Ana experiences extreme
cramping causing her to feel more uncomfortable

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:47.569
in her pregnancy.

00:05:47.569 --> 00:05:51.639
On the way home, after buying some pine nuts,
Clara notices that the moon is full, expecting

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:53.500
that Ana may sleepwalk again.

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.800
As she arrives home, she hears the struggling
Ana let out a faint scream and comes to her

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.310
rescue immediately.

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:01.729
It seems like she is about to give birth,
so Clara calms her down while she calls the

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:03.620
doctor, who is currently unresponsive.

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:07.139
Ana’s safety is on the line because the
pregnancy is too much for her, and the pain

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:08.960
becomes unbearable.

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.830
Realizing that the doctor won’t be of any
help at this hour, Clara comes back to the

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:15.010
room only to find Ana’s ruptured belly and
her lifeless body.

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:17.629
She bids her final goodbye by giving her a
last kiss.

00:06:17.629 --> 00:06:21.360
On the floor, she sees a werewolf pup bloodily
crawling and realizes that Ana gave birth

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.419
to a creature far from human.

00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:26.659
Despite being confused, she tends to the pup
but decides to run away and abandon it in

00:06:26.659 --> 00:06:27.990
the streets.

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:31.300
Clara changes her mind upon hearing the pup’s
cries and decides to take care of it in her

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:33.539
old apartment, naming it Joel.

00:06:33.539 --> 00:06:37.170
The pup’s cries are uncontrollable, so Clara
decides to feed it with her blood, despite

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:38.700
the pain that she has to endure.

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:42.370
&nbsp;
Years later, Clara raises Joel as her own.

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:45.419
His wolf-like look has subsided, and he seems
completely normal.

00:06:45.419 --> 00:06:48.870
The two spend most of their time together
while Clara works as a nurse.

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:55.759
One of her patients, Doña Norma, has a granddaughter
named Amanda, one of Joel’s very few friends.

00:06:55.759 --> 00:07:01.009
At school, Joel isn’t doing very well, but
he is always comforted by Mauricio, his best

00:07:01.009 --> 00:07:02.009
friend.

00:07:02.009 --> 00:07:05.870
To conceal his thirst for blood, Clara raises
him strictly as a vegetarian; Mauricio mocks

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:08.610
him for his diet, but Joel insists that he
likes being healthy.

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:12.460
It happens to be Joel’s birthday, but he
seems down, feeling like everyone has forgotten

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:13.949
about his special day.

00:07:13.949 --> 00:07:16.949
But little does he know, their neighbors have
planned a surprise birthday party for him

00:07:16.949 --> 00:07:19.889
in Doña Amelia’s apartment, which makes
him ecstatic.

00:07:19.889 --> 00:07:23.099
Among the food prepared is a meat stew, but
Clara reminds him that he is allergic.&nbsp;

00:07:23.099 --> 00:07:25.659
&nbsp;
Clara lets Joel sleep in a smaller secret

00:07:25.659 --> 00:07:29.159
chamber known as the “little bedroom,”
where she chains him up on full moons.

00:07:29.159 --> 00:07:33.090
As disturbing as it may seem, Joel does it
willingly as Clara is still gentle with him.

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:36.629
Joel asks her if he could go to a school party
with Amanda on Friday, but because the moon

00:07:36.629 --> 00:07:40.099
is still full, Clara refuses, putting him
in a miserable mood.

00:07:40.099 --> 00:07:43.819
The following day, Joel has developed extreme
hair growth all around his body, and his nails

00:07:43.819 --> 00:07:45.059
have grown overnight.

00:07:45.059 --> 00:07:48.689
Moreover, he has forgotten everything that
has happened the night before, but Clara comforts

00:07:48.689 --> 00:07:50.219
him while being groomed.

00:07:50.219 --> 00:07:53.819
After Doña Amelia babysits him while Clara
is at the pharmacy, she notices that the boy

00:07:53.819 --> 00:07:55.469
is weak and docile.

00:07:55.469 --> 00:07:59.060
Thinking that he may be hungry, Doña Amelia
cooks a piece of meat for him, but he hesitates

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:01.569
at first, saying that he is not allowed to
eat it.

00:08:01.569 --> 00:08:04.779
The old lady convinces him by saying that
it tastes good, but Clara should not know

00:08:04.779 --> 00:08:07.410
about it, and it should stay a secret between
them.

00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:10.849
Joel takes the first bite of meat, and just
like that, he realizes what he has been missing

00:08:10.849 --> 00:08:12.059
all these years.

00:08:12.059 --> 00:08:15.659
A whiff of energy takes over him, and he starts
to devour the meat with his hands, almost

00:08:15.659 --> 00:08:16.979
aggressively.

00:08:16.979 --> 00:08:19.160
&nbsp;
Clara comes home that night, seeing Joel uncover

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:22.650
Ana’s picture, making Clara mad at him for
going through her things.

00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:26.719
Unexpectedly, Joel becomes more hostile toward
her, saying that she isn’t his birth mother.

00:08:26.719 --> 00:08:30.600
She tries all her best to calm him down, but
to no avail, so she forces her into the little

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:32.810
bedroom but ends up being wounded by him.

00:08:32.810 --> 00:08:36.190
Curious about his actions, she confronts Doña
Amelia if she gave him anything, to which

00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:38.500
she admits that she cooked a piece of meat
for him.

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:42.219
Devastated, Clara sinks into the chair, realizing
that Joel might crave meat for the rest of

00:08:42.219 --> 00:08:43.409
his life.

00:08:43.409 --> 00:08:46.680
Moments later, he hears Mauricio and Amanda
calling for Joel to check if he has gotten

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:47.810
any better.

00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:51.200
Clara informs them that he is still sick,
so they hand her a gift to give to him.

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:54.940
In the morning, Joel has transformed again,
and Clara enters the room to give him his

00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:57.280
friends’ gifts before letting him know about
his mother.

00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:00.630
He also asks about his father, but Clara knows
nothing of him.&nbsp;

00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:02.640
&nbsp;
In school, he becomes more active and participates

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:03.940
more in class.

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:07.690
He and Mauricio entertain the whole class
by reenacting a combat scene where Joel playfully

00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:11.110
defeats him but regrets it right away, making
their classmates applaud.

00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:14.890
Afterward, the two boys plan on going out
together unsupervised because Joel wants to

00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:16.310
look for his father.

00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:19.590
His only clue is a receipt from a mall where
Ana used to buy shoes.

00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:23.690
They commute and ride a train around the city
while Clara is clueless about Joel’s whereabouts.

00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:26.810
She fetches him at school but finds out that
he isn’t there, and worry soon takes over

00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:27.810
her.

00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:31.329
She tirelessly goes around town, asking everyone
if they have seen the two boys.&nbsp;

00:09:31.329 --> 00:09:33.720
&nbsp;
Meanwhile, the mall starts to close, but Joel

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:36.240
and Mauricio manage to hide inside a shop.

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:39.901
As night falls, Joel becomes more silent,
feeling uncomfortable in his own skin, but

00:09:39.901 --> 00:09:42.040
Mauricio pays it no mind at first.

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:45.519
They stroll through the mall when Joel eventually
transforms into a werewolf.

00:09:45.519 --> 00:09:49.230
His nails and hair start growing, and his
face is replaced by a monster, putting Mauricio

00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:50.620
in a state of panic.

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:53.910
The scared boy starts breaking into tears,
not knowing what to do.

00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:57.510
In a matter of seconds, Joel reveals himself
completely as a werewolf, and because of his

00:09:57.510 --> 00:10:00.850
thirst for blood, he chases Mauricio and implicitly
eats him.

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:05.670
Meanwhile, Clara and Doña Amelia say their
prayers at home, extremely worried about Joel.

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:09.300
They hear a noise outside, so Clara quickly
checks and finds out that Joel has returned

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:11.410
home completely weak and covered in blood.

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:15.620
Suddenly, Doña Amelia sees Joel covered in
hair and blood, advising Clara that they should

00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:18.890
call a priest, but she refuses to do any procedure
on him.

00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:23.160
While the landlady is making the phone call,
she tranquilizes her, knocking her unconscious.

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:25.690
She plans on running away with Joel the following
day.

00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:29.200
Clara confronts Joel about his sudden disappearance,
to which he explains that he was looking for

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:30.200
his father.

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:33.410
He had no idea of how he got back or anything
about Mauricio.

00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:37.560
Joel becomes extremely stubborn, refusing
to come with Clara and do anything she says.

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:40.970
The kid walks out and enters the little bedroom
saying that he wants to take down the lights,

00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:42.720
so Clara helps him out.

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:44.619
Unknown to her, Joel tricks and locks her
inside.&nbsp;

00:10:44.619 --> 00:10:46.870
&nbsp;
At school, Joel still has no idea that he

00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:50.860
is responsible for his best friend’s death,
even missing him being his seatmate.

00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:54.130
During the break, Amanda talks to Joel about
the school dance, and he replies by saying

00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:56.140
that he will attend it later that night.

00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:59.470
Back in the apartment, Clara tries to open
the metal door with all her will, but it is

00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:00.470
useless.

00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:05.089
Her worried coworker, Angela, visits her after
numerous missed calls and sees that the gate

00:11:05.089 --> 00:11:07.180
is unlocked, so she comes in.

00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:10.800
Confused, she enters the dark apartment and
hears thumping noises from the small chamber,

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:13.089
so she unlocks it, allowing Clara to be free.

00:11:13.089 --> 00:11:16.610
Hurriedly, she loads the revolver that was
once owned by Ana and makes her way to the

00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:19.639
school dance, having a strong instinct that
Joel might be there.

00:11:19.639 --> 00:11:23.060
She also stumbles upon Mauricio’s father,
who is frantic that his son has not been home

00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:26.610
for two nights, but Ana is too busy at the
moment and runs off.

00:11:26.610 --> 00:11:30.089
Just as the dance is about to start, Joel
and Amanda are playfully dancing when he begins

00:11:30.089 --> 00:11:32.110
to transform into a werewolf.

00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:35.630
Not shortly after, Joel isn’t letting go
of Amanda’s hands, scratching her too hard

00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:37.389
and causing her to panic.

00:11:37.389 --> 00:11:41.019
Eerily, he starts falling silent while his
body turns into a dangerous and blood-thirsty

00:11:41.019 --> 00:11:43.860
creature, but he manages to tell Amanda to
run away.

00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:47.389
It is too late for Amanda as she freezes while
looking at the already-werewolf Joel, who

00:11:47.389 --> 00:11:49.389
is now setting his eyes on her as prey.

00:11:49.389 --> 00:11:52.990
Luckily, Clara arrives and shoots him in the
leg before he could harm the little girl any

00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:53.990
further.

00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:56.839
The traumatized girl reunites with her classmates
in the middle of the party.

00:11:56.839 --> 00:12:01.010
Her bloody appearance makes them speechless,
and she tells them about what she witnessed.

00:12:01.010 --> 00:12:03.830
Because of this, the locals hunt Joel and
track down their home.&nbsp;

00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:05.930
&nbsp;
Meanwhile, Clare takes Joel back to the Little

00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:08.269
Bedroom to remove the bullet and heal his
wound.

00:12:08.269 --> 00:12:11.550
The beast in the boy has taken the best of
him, but Clara sings a lullaby that manages

00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:12.980
to tame Joel down.

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:16.520
Unfortunately, the townsfolk have entered
their apartment and start trashing it out,

00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:17.530
believing that Joel is hell-sent.

00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:22.410
Finally, Joel and Clara have reconnected despite
his non-human form, so she decides that she

00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:24.160
can’t keep him chained and hungry.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:27.649
While the locals bang loudly on the door,
Clara and Joel emotionally hold hands and

00:12:27.649 --> 00:12:35.470
prepare to face all of them together as Joel
lets out one 

00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:39.250
strong howl.
