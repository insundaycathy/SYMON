00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.320
Hi, Mystery Recapped here. Today,&nbsp;
I’m going to explain a science&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:09.040
fiction action film called “Fortress.” 
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care!
 
&nbsp;

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.520
The movie begins in futuristic Canada where&nbsp;
the government has banned the birth of a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.640
second child to control the population. No one&nbsp;
is allowed to give birth to more than a child,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.480
even if the first one dies. 
At the heavily guarded Canada–United&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.200
States border station, an automated voice requests&nbsp;
everyone to take their personal belongings to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:36.240
inspection office. Former army officer John Henry&nbsp;
Brennick and his wife Karen Brennick are in a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:41.920
car about to be inspected. The couple seems to be&nbsp;
nervous about the check. When Karen moves her arm,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.880
a magnetic vest that she is wearing inside her&nbsp;
overcoat is visible. Turns out that Karen is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.560
pregnant and they are going to Vancouver&nbsp;
to give birth to their second child. 
&nbsp;

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:55.440
After the first child is born, the government&nbsp;
ties the female’s tube. However, Karen got lucky&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.640
and got pregnant again. Hence, the magnetic vest&nbsp;
is to cover her pregnancy. When they are at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.560
inspection center, the soldiers order them&nbsp;
to get out of the car with their belongings.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:08.240
While a soldier checks Karen’s bag,&nbsp;
a girl in front of them gets arrested&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.240
for being pregnant. But as Karen walks&nbsp;
through the scanning machine, the magnetic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.720
vest stops it from alerting the guards. 
The couple is safely outside but one guard&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.840
approaches them and notices the magnetic vest on&nbsp;
Karen. An alarm starts to ring and the soldiers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.320
attack them. John manages to fight them and&nbsp;
runs away with Karen to cross the bridge.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.440
As the soldiers pursue them, John asks Karen to&nbsp;
run away without him and she reluctantly agrees.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.080
John is soon arrested, but Karen manages to&nbsp;
flee. In the following scene, we see John&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.840
and other prisoners like him in a vehicle,&nbsp;
being taken to a prison called the fortress.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:45.760
It is a privately-owned maximum security prison&nbsp;
operated by the Men-Tel corporation. The fortress&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.000
lies in the middle of a massive desert and&nbsp;
escaping from the prison is impossible. They&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.720
get inside the facility and the guards make them&nbsp;
strip naked. A voice in the background welcomes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.440
the prisoners to the fortress and introduces&nbsp;
himself as director Poe. The prisoners are then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.160
brought to a room where everyone is fitted with&nbsp;
a Psychological security intelligence system.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.720
The system is fitted into their intestine and is&nbsp;
triggered when anyone breaks the prison’s rules.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.200
The process is called intestination.
Poe announces that after the implantation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.280
of the technology, the prisoners who cross the&nbsp;
yellow line on the floor will be induced with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.400
extreme pain in their abdomen, and the ones who&nbsp;
cross the red line will die instantly. One of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.440
inmates gets nervous and crosses the yellow line.&nbsp;
As soon as he does, he falls down in pain. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:33.120
accidentally crosses the red line too. The man’s&nbsp;
stomach starts to bloat and eventually bursts.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.040
Others are put into an elevator that goes&nbsp;
underground. It is revealed that the prison&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.960
is thirty stories underground. John and a fellow&nbsp;
inmate named Nino Gomez are let off on a floor.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.840
They are greeted by a monitoring device called the&nbsp;
Zed-10 which takes them to a crowded prison cell.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.480
One of the inmates named Stiggs yells at Zed,&nbsp;
claiming that the cell already has too many&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.520
people but Zed instead threatens to intestinate&nbsp;
him. The cells have a laser beam that stops&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.400
inmates from going out when not needed. John&nbsp;
introduces himself to another inmate named D-day.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.120
As they are about to fall asleep, the third&nbsp;
inmate named Abraham tells John to not dream. 
&nbsp;

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.760
After everyone is asleep, Zed comes&nbsp;
to inspect the prisoners. It scans&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.640
John’s face and goes into his dream. John is&nbsp;
dreaming about him making love to Karen. 
&nbsp;

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.520
Somewhere else in the monitoring room, the&nbsp;
prison’s director, Poe watches John’s dream&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:26.880
and grows an infatuation with Karen. He reminds&nbsp;
John, dreaming is an unauthorized thought process&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:32.080
that is not allowed in the facility and wakes him&nbsp;
up. Sharp pain in his abdomen makes him struggle,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.000
suggesting that he has been intestinated.&nbsp;
The following day, the inmates are made&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.960
to work in underground construction. 
A homosexual inmate named Maddox sexually&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:46.480
assaults Nino. John comes to his rescue and fights&nbsp;
Maddox. Zed stops the commotion by triggering&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.920
the device in their abdomen. Later, all three of&nbsp;
them are kept in a tiny laser cell and asked who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:57.200
started the fight. Nino is too scared of Maddox,&nbsp;
to tell the truth. To save Nino, John lies that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:02.640
he himslef started the fight. He is then taken to&nbsp;
Poe’s office where Abraham is shaving Poe’s beard.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:08.400
Poe shows John a live video of Karen showering.&nbsp;
As it turns out, she was arrested after John and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.680
brought to prison as well. Poe intestinates&nbsp;
Karen and John, making them whimper in pain&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.720
as his punishment. Later, Abraham tells John&nbsp;
that floors A and B are the women’s quarters,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.880
hence Karen might be there too. 
Then, we see Karen in her cell talking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.560
to a fellow pregnant girl. As her&nbsp;
stomach starts to hurt, two guards&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.120
take her away. Everyone in the women’s quarter&nbsp;
is pregnant. Karen realizes that the facility&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.440
does something with their newborn children. 
In the men’s quarter, Maddox picks a fight with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.840
John. The men get into an intense battle&nbsp;
as everyone in the facility watches them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:43.040
along with Poe from his cabin. Karen sees her&nbsp;
husband from her floor and is surprised. Both&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:48.400
the parties are bloodied when John pushes Maddox&nbsp;
off the edge but he hangs onto it. Poe orders&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.840
John to finish off Maddox but John instead helps&nbsp;
him. Poe takes the matter into his hands and uses&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:59.680
a weapon to kill Maddox that blows up his whole&nbsp;
stomach creating a hole in it. John finds Maddox’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:04.880
abdomen device on the floor and secretly hands it&nbsp;
to Nino before being taken away by the guards. 
&nbsp;

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:09.360
In the following scene, Karen walks into a room&nbsp;
where John is suspended in a massive machine&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:14.800
called the ‘mind wipe chamber’. Poe has sent her&nbsp;
to ask John to cooperate with them. They talk for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:19.600
a while but the guards drag her out soon. The&nbsp;
machine starts to move along with John making&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:24.720
him hallucinate, this is his punishment for not&nbsp;
obeying director Poe’s order to kill Maddox.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:29.520
John’s brain slowly starts to break down as he&nbsp;
sees his time at the military, his wedding day,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:34.800
and so on. After three days, Poe invites Karen&nbsp;
to his chamber. He is surprised that John has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:39.920
lasted this long as the maximum someone has ever&nbsp;
lasted on the machine is an hour. He offers Karen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:44.960
to let John free if she stays with him, at his&nbsp;
chamber as his companion. With no choice left,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:50.400
Karen agrees. When John returns to his cell, he is&nbsp;
completely brain dead. He doesn’t talk to anyone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:55.760
and has become completely numb to pain. 
Karen has started to live with Poe. One night,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:01.440
she wakes up to see Poe in a chair attached to&nbsp;
several wires. As it turns out he was modified to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:07.600
be an advanced human. He doesn’t sleep or eat, but&nbsp;
intakes amino acids once a month. The same happens&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:12.080
with all the children born in the prison. They&nbsp;
go through several procedures to be turned into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:17.920
advanced humans, so that one day, mankind can be&nbsp;
free of overpopulation and starvation. Poe was one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:23.680
of the first babies to be experimented upon. Karen&nbsp;
is shocked by the information. Four months pass&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:28.640
and John has still not recovered. Abraham tells&nbsp;
him that Karen’s belly is finally showing and his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:34.560
baby will be born the world soon. John doesn’t&nbsp;
react, but sheds a single tear. That night,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:39.280
Karen tricks Poe into drinking alcohol which&nbsp;
makes him pass out. She uses the control panel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:44.240
to control John’s dream, in which she sees the&nbsp;
kid version of John trapped in a pit. She brings&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:49.440
him out of the pit, bringing the real John back&nbsp;
into consciousness. His inmate friends are shocked&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:54.960
and happy to have him back. John asks Abraham to&nbsp;
help him escape the prison with Karen. Abraham is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:54.960 --> 00:07:00.320
skeptical but agrees to do it for John anyway. 
Abraham tells Karen about John’s recovery. She&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:04.720
is over the moon about her plan working. She&nbsp;
claims that she can help him with the escape&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:10.400
and starts to devise a plan. Later, Nino hands&nbsp;
John the device he had gotten from Maddox’s body.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:15.040
Their inmate friend D-Day used to be a computer&nbsp;
geek before coming to the prison. He offers to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:19.040
take the device apart and study it. 
Next, we see Karen steal a diamond-like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:24.400
holographic lense from Poe’s cabin. She almost&nbsp;
gets caught, but manages to hide the device inside&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:29.440
her mouth. She hands the device to Abraham the&nbsp;
following day and asks him to give it to John.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:32.800
Abraham doesn’t want to get in trouble,&nbsp;
but accepts doing it as a favor. 
&nbsp;

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:37.520
The guys use the cell’s protective laser beams&nbsp;
to trigger the lens and look at the hologram&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:41.600
of the facility. They find that there is&nbsp;
a way out through the construction site.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:47.280
The following morning, Abraham puts the lens back&nbsp;
in Poe’s cabin. Poe asks Karen to divorce John and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:52.240
marry him. He claims he will treat the child&nbsp;
as his own and even promises to let John free.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:57.840
Karen accepts the offer for her husband and child.&nbsp;
Meanwhile, D-Day figures out how the intestinate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:03.360
device works. The device is magnetic and can be&nbsp;
used to bring out the devices from other bodies.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:08.000
They try the procedure and are surprised when it&nbsp;
works. They get all of their intestinate devices&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.640
out. The following day, Poe is alerted by Zed&nbsp;
to look through the security camera footage,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:17.760
where he sees Karen stealing the lens and Abraham&nbsp;
putting it back. He is angered to see he has been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:21.600
betrayed, but Zed informs him that he has been&nbsp;
dismissed because of his carelessness. 
&nbsp;

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:27.040
Meanwhile, the boys put their plan into action.&nbsp;
They attach their intestinate devices to a metal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:31.920
pipe in the construction area and pose as if they&nbsp;
are fighting. As Zed finds out about the fight,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:36.640
it triggers the intestinates, causing them to&nbsp;
explode. This creates a way for them to escape&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:40.960
through the pipe. But Poe activates the&nbsp;
steam valves and sends hot gas into the pipes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:45.680
to keep them trapped. He also activates the&nbsp;
strike clones who start firing at the group&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:50.400
from inside the facility. They are stuck&nbsp;
in the pipe now. One of the inmates, Stiggs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:55.520
panics and tries to go into the facility again,&nbsp;
but the clones shoot him dead. Meanwhile, Abraham&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:55.520 --> 00:09:00.960
approaches Karen at the facility but before they&nbsp;
can do anything, Poe finds them. He kills Abraham&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:06.640
and makes some soldiers take Karen to turn her&nbsp;
baby into an ‘advanced human’ like him. Meanwhile,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:11.120
the guys manage to kill one of the clones and&nbsp;
find out that he is an advanced human as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:15.680
John takes his gun and attacks the other clones.&nbsp;
They get inside the facility while battling the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:20.960
clones. In the end, they manage to get on top&nbsp;
of an elevator-like machine that lifts them up.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:24.080
Everyone in the prison cheers for&nbsp;
them when they see them escaping. 
&nbsp;

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:29.440
They finally reach Poe’s chamber and demand to&nbsp;
meet Karen. The screen shows the doctors trying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:34.720
to extract her baby. John threatens Poe to cease&nbsp;
the delivery but since he has been dismissed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:39.600
the system doesn’t take his command. One of the&nbsp;
killing devices recognizes the guys and tries to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:45.120
shoot them, but they quickly dodge it, making Poe&nbsp;
its victim. After Poe’s death, D-Day gets on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:49.840
control panel and tries to stop the doctors from&nbsp;
performing the procedure on Karen. But before he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:54.960
can complete the process, a clone shoots him. John&nbsp;
manages to kill the clone and an injured D-Day&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:59.680
disables the whole facility’s electrical system&nbsp;
with his final strength. The doctors stop the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:04.960
procedure for the time being. The security system&nbsp;
fails and every prisoner starts running away.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:09.680
John and Nino are the only survivors. They go&nbsp;
to look for Karen and take her away from the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:14.160
doctors. The three get into a vehicle and&nbsp;
finally drive away from the facility. 
&nbsp;

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:18.880
They only stop when they cross the border and&nbsp;
reach Mexico. Karen is about to give birth in a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:23.440
shed when the vehicle they drove in, starts&nbsp;
to move on its own. As it turns out it is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:28.960
still being controlled by the facility. It hits&nbsp;
Nino and kills him. John goes out to fight the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:33.520
vehicle as Karen is in labor inside the shed.&nbsp;
John attacks the vehicle with the weapon from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:37.600
earlier and explodes it. But the vehicle&nbsp;
strikes the shed, and Karen is buried in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:43.760
its remains. A distressed John looks for his wife&nbsp;
and finds her safe nearby. She has a newborn baby&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:48.160
in her hands. The movie ends as the two&nbsp;
look at their kid in fascination.
