00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.470
Hey what's up, guys? Explanation pro is here.
Today I'll explain a Horror/comedy horror

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.629
film. Title PEE MAK. Spoilers incoming.

00:00:07.629 --> 00:00:11.290
The film opens in a small house, where the
pregnant Nak falls to the ground, calling

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:13.500
his husband’s name, Pee Mak.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.970
The film then transitions to a medic, Ter,
grimly telling his comrades about his experience.

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.980
As a result, he gets slapped in the head by
a man with a stupid-looking hairdo, Puak.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.050
Mak then is brought to the room, screaming
in pain, only to find out that it’s just

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.940
a sprain. Puak encourages them never to surrender,
telling them that they still have swords to

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:32.789
fight against the enemy. As they courageously
charge, they forget that the enemies have

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:33.789
guns.

00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:36.760
In the trenches, Mak tells his new friends
that they will not die there because he still

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.059
wants to see his wife and child. Because of
this, they carried on to battle, with Mak

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:45.519
getting shot every time. While this is happening,
Nak hauntingly sings for her husband, making

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:48.989
the townspeople lock themselves in their houses.
She must be a bad singer.

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.920
Wouldn’t you know it, the gang survives
the war. Afterward, Mak returns in a boat

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.019
to Phra Khanong while being accompanied by
his friends. Upon reaching the town, all they

00:00:57.019 --> 00:01:00.749
see are empty houses. They then continue toward
Mak’s house, and they reach the place by

00:01:00.749 --> 00:01:01.749
nightfall.

00:01:01.749 --> 00:01:06.010
Mak calls Nak, but he receives no reply. Mak
then sees a rocking baby’s crib, but he

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.370
finds it empty upon inspection. Suddenly,
Nak hugs him from behind. They then joyfully

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.000
kiss and embrace each other. Mak then sees
his son, with Nak informing him that she named

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.030
the child after his favourite name. Upon shouting
the name, the gang gets disappointed by how

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.730
ugly the name is, with Puak commenting that
his servant has a nicer name.

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:26.290
Afterward, Mak introduces his wife to his
friends in order: Aey, Ter, Puak, and Shin.

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.990
After learning that his friends have to stay
for one night because it is already too late

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.150
to leave, Mak implores them to stay for much
longer than that. Mak then points them to

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.920
his aunt’s old house across the river, telling
them to stay there for a while.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.770
That night, Mak tells Nak that she is all
he thought about during the war. After Nak

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.250
scares him by pointing out that there is a
ghost, Mak immediately tells Nak that he’s

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.850
afraid of ghosts, which somehow makes Nak
sad. After talking to each other, Nak proceeds

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.810
to rock the baby while singing a haunting
lullaby that echoes throughout, inducing the

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.450
townspeople with fear.

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.690
The following day, Puak is rudely awakened
by Shin imitating the chirping of birds. Mak

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.410
then shouts at them from outside, telling
them that they have to go to the market. Ter

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:05.270
and Mak then see a boat carrying dead bodies
from the war.

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.129
While rowing a boat toward the town, Shin
waves at Nak, who is by the window. But Nak

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:12.239
just ominously stares, making Shin uncomfortable.

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.049
When they reach the town, they find the market
is crowded. Mak then approaches a street vendor

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:19.959
that he knows, but the street vendor immediately
hides what she’s selling, telling Mak that

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:23.870
she’s all out. This happens again with another
vendor, who tells Mak that he’s not selling

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.170
fish because it’s a holy day.

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.420
In the liquor store, Mak talks to the dozing
vendor. However, realizing that the boy is

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.600
Mak, the vendor suddenly tells Mak that he
should look under and between his legs to

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.459
see what Nak is. But she is interrupted by
a boy named Ping, who tells the gang that

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:38.400
she speaks nonsense when drunk.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.439
That night, while drinking, the four boys
talk about the strange happenings earlier.

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:43.349
Shin then tells them that when he was a child,
his mom would tell her that one can see a

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:48.069
ghost by looking between the legs. Ter then
asks her if he implies that Nak is a ghost,

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:51.879
and when Shin nods, the other three laugh
at him. They then command Shin to invite Mak

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:55.310
to their drinking session, and Shin has no
choice but to accept because he’s that least

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:56.310
drunk.

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.330
While Shin is climbing the stairs to Mak’s
house, one of the steps breaks. He sees Nak,

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.209
asking her if Mak is there. He then feels
relief because Nak talks to him normally.

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:07.799
However, Nak begins to bleed from between
her legs, ending with a nightmarish drop of

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:08.799
a fetus.

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:12.290
Shin suddenly wakes up from this bad dream.
But he soon finds out that it is a case of

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.099
déjà vu. After being commanded again to
go to Mak’s house, Shin goes again and climbs

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:19.980
the stairs. Knowing one of the steps is going
to break, he crosses beyond it, but the next

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.430
step breaks instead. After getting up to the
house, he finds the whole house untidy. After

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.909
seeing the crib move by itself and seeing
Nak’s hand reaching a lime below the house

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:31.510
even if she’s upstairs, Shin leaves the
scene immediately to return to his buddies.

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.560
Aey, Ter, and Puak drunkenly sing and dance
their marching song. Shin then arrives to

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.889
tell them that Nak is a ghost, stating that
the house is messy, the crib moved on its

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:43.780
own, and Nak inhumanly reaches a lime with
a long arm. But all of this is countered by

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.849
Shin’s friends as imaginations.

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:50.060
The following day, the gang helps Mak because
the townspeople all act strange. Ter is then

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.849
assigned to take the axe inside the house.
Upon climbing the stairs, Ter sees that Shin

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:57.439
was correct in saying that the house is untidy.
He then attempts to look between his legs,

00:03:57.439 --> 00:04:02.019
but instead, he wrongly looks at Nak’s legs.
Ter then tells Shin that he made the ghost-identifying

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:03.499
move but finds nothing.

00:04:03.499 --> 00:04:07.650
Afterward, Ter takes a dump in the forest.
There, he sees a mummified corpse wearing

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.940
a ring, making him run. In his run, he knocks
over a bee’s nest, and when he returns,

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.809
Shin and Aey see his bloated face from bee
stings. Ter then sees Nak wearing the same

00:04:15.809 --> 00:04:17.709
ring that the corpse had, finally concluding
that Nak is indeed a ghost. He tries to warn

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:20.799
his friends, but they cannot understand him
because his face is bloated.

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:23.130
Ter then writes what he’s saying. After
giving it to the gang, they are understandably

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.250
surprised. It rains afterward, and Mak sees
his friends outside his house. After seeing

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.500
the paper that Puak is holding, Mak approaches
them to know what it is about. After attempting

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.560
to pass it from one person to another, Mak
finally reads it, getting shocked as well.

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.340
The four then immediately leave Mak to return
to the guest house.

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.879
There, Shin asks Ter why he did not see Nak
as a ghost when he looked between the legs,

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:45.000
and Ter answers that he looked at Nak’s
legs, not knowing that he is supposed to look

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.750
between his legs. They then witness through
the window how Mak confronts Nak. However,

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:53.300
Mak embraces Nak, confusing the gang. Ter
then understands that Mak misread what is

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.639
written because the ink has been smudged by
the rain, reading it as “gross” instead

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:59.960
of “ghost”. While the others have made
up their mind to leave, Ter does not want

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.290
to abandon Mak.

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:05.340
That night, Ter and Shin decide to go to Mak
to tell him about Nak, leaving Aey and Puak

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.900
behind. Aey and Puak then are approached by
Ping, telling them to help him slaughter his

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.470
cow as a funeral offering. When they learned
that it was for Ping’s mother and that his

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:16.070
mother died because she attempted to reveal
Nak’s identity, Aey and Puak immediately

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:17.670
followed their friends to warn them.

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:21.840
Ter is about to tell Mak that his wife is
a ghost, but he changes it instead to “beautiful”

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.240
after seeing Nak. Aey and Puak arrive with
wet clothes, implying that they crossed the

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.980
river without a boat. As they are about to
return to their house, Nak suggests eating

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:30.610
at Mak’s residence.

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:34.540
Afterward, upon seeing the disgusting food,
the four tell Mak that they are full. Ter,

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:38.640
however, eats because he sees Nak’s deadly
stare as if to say the food is to die for.

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:42.490
After Ter eats a dry leaf, the rest eat as
well, with poor Shin having to eat the worms.

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:46.539
Afterward, Mak then invites them to hold his
child, with Shin unluckily chosen again.

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:49.409
After noticing that the four are signalling
each other, Mak wrongly thought they were

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:52.240
thinking about playing charades. While playing
charades, Mak always answers with far-fetched

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.570
guesses, prompting Ter to wonder what Mak’s
IQ is. When it is Ter’s turn, the word he

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:59.979
has to make them guess for is “desert”.
They then quickly get the second syllable

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:02.930
with the word “shirt”. When they can’t
get the first syllable, Ter points at Nak

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:06.130
and Shin immediately connects the two syllables
“dead” and “shirt” to form “desert”.

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:10.539
They celebrate only briefly when they realize
that they revealed Nak is dead. They then

00:06:10.539 --> 00:06:13.810
make excuses to leave after Mak asks them
what the answer is.

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:17.100
While trying hard to go back to their house
via a boat, the boat briefly circles back

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:20.780
twice due to their anxiety-filled rowing before
finally returning on track.

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:24.020
Mak confronts the four in their house, telling
them that Ping lied to the villagers about

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:27.850
his wife being a ghost because Nak rejected
Ping’s courtship. Mak returns to his house,

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:29.960
telling Nak that he already kicked out his
friends.

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:34.310
Afterward, Mak and Nak then go to a carnival,
with Nak wearing a mask to hide her identity.

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:37.780
They then have fun together. Nak helps Mak
win a “knock the cans” game and remove

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:41.790
the Ferris wheel queue by using her ghostly
powers. While aboard the Ferris wheel, Nak

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:45.610
asks her husband if he can live without her,
and Mak answers that he can’t.

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:49.640
Afterward, the couple enters the haunted house,
while Ter, Puak, and Shin observe from afar.

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:52.099
Ter then tells them that he brought holy rice.

00:06:52.099 --> 00:06:56.039
Inside the haunted house, the four kidnap
Mak behind Nak’s back. However, upon finding

00:06:56.039 --> 00:06:59.789
out that the door is stuck, the four change
as the haunted house’s monsters, with Ter

00:06:59.789 --> 00:07:03.750
placing his foot on Mak’s mouth. After Nak
leaves, the four move again to leave the place,

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:07.569
but they reencounter Nak, with Nak reaching
Ter with her elongated arm. They then break

00:07:07.569 --> 00:07:08.630
through the walls to escape to the forest.

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:11.530
In the forest, the four let go of Mak. Mak
then admonishes them for doing this, telling

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:15.350
them that the arm they saw earlier is just
a prop. After telling them that he tried the

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:18.840
“looking between the legs” method and
saw nothing, Mak leaves them.

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:22.199
The gang attempts to follow Mak but cannot
find him. They then see a trail of blood which

00:07:22.199 --> 00:07:26.030
leads to Mak. Mak’s war wound has opened
again, leading Ter to think that Mak might

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:29.719
be the ghost. Ter and Shin then take Mak’s
hand to see if he has the wedding ring, and

00:07:29.719 --> 00:07:33.810
upon finding nothing, they feel relieved.
However, when Mak shows that his ring is in

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:37.840
his necklace, Ter immediately throws the holy
rice at Mak, making Mak scream in pain. The

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:39.509
four then flee from the area.

00:07:39.509 --> 00:07:43.229
After stopping their run, the four then talk
about Nak actually being the living one. They

00:07:43.229 --> 00:07:46.599
then agree to save Nak from Mak rather than
leaving her alone with the dead.

00:07:46.599 --> 00:07:50.030
Returning to Nak’s house, Puak calls Nak,
telling her that she must go with them. The

00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:53.499
sceptical Shin is still afraid of her, telling
them about the food earlier, and Puak justifies

00:07:53.499 --> 00:07:57.849
it as just healthy options. After Nak searches
for Mak, the gang makes up an excuse that

00:07:57.849 --> 00:08:00.439
Mak is somewhere else. They then leave on
a boat.

00:08:00.439 --> 00:08:04.050
In the next scene, the boat starts to sink,
so they have to throw their belongings away.

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:08.129
Puak stupidly asks Nak if her son is necessary,
and he receives silence as an answer. Ter

00:08:08.129 --> 00:08:12.039
then has the bright idea to throw the paddles
away, and the boat stops sinking after that,

00:08:12.039 --> 00:08:14.930
resulting in a celebration. But now they can’t
move.

00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:18.550
Suddenly, Mak appears on the shore, scaring
the four idiots. Mak then swims toward them,

00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:22.379
but he gets a muscle cramp and begins to drown.
They then help Mak get out of the water. Mak

00:08:22.379 --> 00:08:25.659
then admonishes them for leaving him. Ter
asks why Mak screamed in pain when the holy

00:08:25.659 --> 00:08:29.400
rice was thrown at him, and Mak answers that
the rice struck his wound.

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:33.500
The boat starts sinking again, prompting Puak
to ask Nak again if her son is still necessary.

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:37.180
They then paddle with their hands. Ter stops
them, asking about the real ghost. After Aey

00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:40.339
drops the wedding ring, Ter screams that Aey
is the ghost, kicking Aey from the boat.

00:08:40.339 --> 00:08:43.539
After pointlessly paddling with their hands,
Nak gives them a paddle. Ter stops from his

00:08:43.539 --> 00:08:47.250
track after realizing that the paddle is so
far now, which means Nak is the ghost. Ter

00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:50.671
then stands to look between his legs, but
all he sees is his friends’ faces. After

00:08:50.671 --> 00:08:53.760
failing to get their heads out of the way,
Ter smartly sings their marching song, which

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:57.960
the others follow. After the song is done,
Ter finally sees Nak’s ghostly face. Nak

00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:01.950
then reaches Mak with her elongated arm, prompting
them to leave the boat. However, not knowing

00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:06.100
how to swim, Shin does not jump, leaving him
behind with Nak. But after Nak holds his head,

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:09.740
Shin jumps to the water and expertly swims
to the shore. They then knock out Mak because

00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:11.810
he does not want to leave his wife.

00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:15.829
Inside a temple, Puak, Ter, Shin, and a knocked
out Mak are surrounded by strings while a

00:09:15.829 --> 00:09:19.190
monk is praying beside them. Nak enters the
temple, but the monk is not afraid because

00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:23.149
he has weapons such as holy water, holy rice,
and their strings. However, because of the

00:09:23.149 --> 00:09:26.450
rowdy boys, the holy water is spilled, the
holy rice is fed to the birds, and the string

00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:28.880
gets broken after the monk is kicked toward
it.

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:32.060
Afterward, the gang find themselves tied to
the same strings that are supposed to protect

00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:35.700
them; the monk escapes immediately through
a window. As Nak approaches them, Aey reappears

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:39.690
as well. They then push Puak toward Aey because
he’s still wet from the holy water, resulting

00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:43.800
in not one but two kisses from Puak and Aey.
Aey then tells them he’s not a ghost, that

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:45.399
he got the ring because he is broke.

00:09:45.399 --> 00:09:49.089
They then attempt to escape Nak, making Nak
scream. After disappearing out of sight, they

00:09:49.089 --> 00:09:52.930
find Nak again, but she is hanging on the
roof like Spiderman this time. Nak then tells

00:09:52.930 --> 00:09:56.339
them that she did not kill Ping’s drunkard
mother, who falls down the river on her own.

00:09:56.339 --> 00:09:59.910
But the gang tells her that she is still selfish
because she should have been on the other

00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:03.149
side. Because of this, Nak reaches out to
Mak by stretching her arm.

00:10:03.149 --> 00:10:07.020
Mak anticipates the arm, but he closes his
eyes in fear. Because of this, Nak realizes

00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:10.519
that Mak is afraid of her. She apologizes
to Mak for lying to him, telling him that

00:10:10.519 --> 00:10:14.350
she only wants to be with him for much longer.
Nak then tells Mak that she wants him to carry

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:18.720
on after she’s gone. However, Mak tells
Nak that he knows she’s a ghost all along,

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:22.600
but he decides to continue loving her despite
this realization. After Nak tells him that

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:26.300
their supernatural relationship is wrong,
Mak tells her that while he is afraid of ghosts,

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:30.530
he is more afraid of her absence. Because
of this, the gang is moved to tears.

00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:34.560
The film ends with Mak and Nak sharing a passionate
kiss. The post-credit scenes show them living

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:36.749
with Nak despite being a ghost.

00:10:36.749 --> 00:10:37.749
