go over their recordings on david's possessions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:55.600

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:00.960
their house david went to check out the waterbed&nbsp;
and played on it until the demon broke through the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:06.720
mattress and tried to grab david when talking to&nbsp;
debbie they find that there is a rug where the bed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.840
used to be followed by rotting wood previously&nbsp;
thought to be the result of water damage&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:17.040
lorraine goes under the house into the cellar&nbsp;
and discovers a witch's totem the warrens&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.840
believe that this is the work of a cult they&nbsp;
enlist the aid of drew in their investigation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:27.680
at father gordon's suggestion the warrens visit&nbsp;
a former priest named kastner who brought down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:33.440
a cult called the disciples of the ram they show&nbsp;
kastner the picture of the totem which he knows&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:38.960
is the work of a satanist he leads them down to&nbsp;
his basement where he has lots of mementos from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:44.640
the ram cult he claims that the prosecutor on&nbsp;
their case suffered after finding them guilty&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:50.080
when his baby was born premature with his heart&nbsp;
outside his body and his wife committed suicide&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:55.680
months later at the psych ward arn is mopping&nbsp;
the floor when it appears that a nearby patient&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:00.800
is possessed and sings call me to him that song&nbsp;
was playing when he killed bruno then before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.760
eventually being knocked down by the entity&nbsp;
and having to be sedated by the orderlies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:11.760
drew calls the warrens and tells them to head to&nbsp;
danvers massachusetts to talk to sergeant clay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:17.120
he tells them about the disappearance of teenage&nbsp;
best friends jessica strong and katie lincoln&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:23.040
katie was stabbed 22 times as well and jessica&nbsp;
was never found but a totem just like the one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:28.960
at the glatzel house was recovered from the crime&nbsp;
scene clay initially refuses to allow the warrens&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:33.760
to check into the case file until lorraine proves&nbsp;
her clairvoyant abilities to clay in front of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:38.800
other officers debbie and david visit arn&nbsp;
where he describes what he has been feeling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:44.640
david knows it completely and causes them to&nbsp;
realize that the same thing the god david is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:50.080
what is plaguing iron right now clay drives the&nbsp;
warrens to the site in the woods where the girls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:55.600
disappeared lorraine finds the spot where&nbsp;
a possessed jessica started stabbing katie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:59.920
but the connection makes lorraine mimic it&nbsp;
to the point where ed must get her to stop&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:06.000
lorraine follows her vision where she chases&nbsp;
katie to the edge of a cliff a demon hand pulls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:12.320
lorraine down but ed catches her and pulls her&nbsp;
up lorraine tells him and clay that jessica must&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:18.640
be at the bottom of the river after falling over&nbsp;
a recovery team goes by and indeed finds a body&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:23.920
debbie calls the warrens and tells them that&nbsp;
the demon is trying to make aaron kill himself&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:29.520
as ed tells her to alert the staff to put aaron&nbsp;
on suicide watch an eerie screeching noise is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:34.960
heard over the phone meanwhile arn is given&nbsp;
a vial of holy water by someone in the prison&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:40.320
and when he starts seeing visions he pours a&nbsp;
circle around himself ed and lorraine break&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:46.080
into the funeral home to find jessica's corpse&nbsp;
lorraine takes her hand and enters the connection&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:51.280
finding herself in what appears to be a dark&nbsp;
basement with black candles and occult books&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:56.320
she finds the occultist woman that arne saw&nbsp;
earlier just as she is attempting to possess&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:03.280
iron into slashing his wrists lorraine stops this&nbsp;
and guards fine darn the occultist acknowledges&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:08.960
lorraine and gets a large man's corpse to come&nbsp;
alive ed pulls lorraine away from jessica's hand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:14.960
to sever the connection and stopping the big&nbsp;
corpse from attacking however lorraine tells ed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:20.800
that the woman now knows who they are the warrens&nbsp;
meet with debbie and vertigo over more research&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:25.600
they connected the curse between the two murders&nbsp;
as the occultists got the totems in the possession&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:30.480
of both parties involved which led to the&nbsp;
possessed committing a murder jessica to katie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:36.400
arne to bruno before the murderer ended up killing&nbsp;
themselves to break the curse one must destroy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:41.840
the altar upon which it was placed and lorraine&nbsp;
knows that the occultist must finish the curse&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:46.960
for the sake of her own soul just as ed tries&nbsp;
to find the connection between the victims&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:53.040
he passes out again when he wakes up the occultist&nbsp;
projects herself to him and threatens him the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:58.640
naked fat corpse attacks again and when it goes&nbsp;
after him he finds that he was almost attacking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:03.920
lorraine they realized that the occultists set&nbsp;
something up for her to invade the space and they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:10.320
uncover a totem inside of ace with rotted flowers&nbsp;
upon further investigation ed andrew learned that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:15.680
jessica got her totem in a box from her school&nbsp;
fairfield university leading ed to realize&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:21.840
that the occultist works near there at the same&nbsp;
time lorraine goes to visit castner for help again&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:27.280
she follows him into the basement where he&nbsp;
reveals that he had a secret daughter isla&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:33.440
who is the occultist in trying to prevent her from&nbsp;
being drawn into the occult he got her interested&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:38.400
kastner informs lorraine that there is a tunnel&nbsp;
under the house where isla used to play which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:44.320
is where the altar may be located lorraine then&nbsp;
hears footsteps and realizes isla is in the house&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:50.720
lorraine goes to find the tunnel while isla finds&nbsp;
kastner and slits his throat father newman is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:57.120
with debbie at arn's side although he feels isla's&nbsp;
presence just as lorraine discovers the altar isla&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:03.120
prepares to bring the curse to its conclusion ed&nbsp;
then rushes to the house and goes to find lorraine&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:08.640
only for isla to find him and blow powder into&nbsp;
his face possessing him and making him go into a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:15.360
rage trying to swing a sledgehammer at lorraine as&nbsp;
this happens arn's possession gets out of control&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:19.680
causing the windows in the ward to break&nbsp;
and release him from his restraints&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:25.760
he starts floating and grabs a glass shard to try&nbsp;
and slash his throat but debbie holds his arm down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:30.720
lorraine gets dirty dead reminding him of their&nbsp;
love and saying that isla thinks love is their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:36.080
weakness but it is their strength ed breaks&nbsp;
free of the possession and smashes the altar&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:41.600
freeing aren from his possession isla attempts&nbsp;
to finish the warrens off herself but it is too&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:46.240
late for her and her demon master comes to&nbsp;
take her soul to hell painfully contorting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:52.080
isla's body until she is a mere shell ed brings&nbsp;
the altar chalice down into the warren museum&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:57.360
