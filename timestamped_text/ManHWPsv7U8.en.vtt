00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:05.720
Story Recapped here. Today I'm going to explain
a horror, mystery, science fiction, and thriller

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.790
film called “The Void." Spoilers ahead!
Watch out and take care.&nbsp;

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:14.280
&nbsp;
During a chaotic night, James escapes from

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:20.520
a farmhouse and into the woods. A woman follows
him outside, but she gets shot in the process.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:27.380
Vincent and his son, Simon, douse her with
gasoline, and Vincent throws a lit cigarette

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.320
on her, burning the woman to death. As they
leave to follow James, a masked man watches

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.350
her in flames without offering an ounce of
help.&nbsp;

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.530
&nbsp;
An officer named Daniel Carter is on duty

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.210
near the area when he finds the struggling
James crawling along the road. Daniel approaches

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:48.079
him to help, thinking that the young man just
might be drunk. Upon seeing his state, the

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:53.830
officer rushes him to a nearby hospital where
Allison Fraser, his estranged wife, works

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:59.309
as a nurse with her colleague, Beverly. The
building has been mostly abandoned following

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:05.390
a fire, leaving the staff working as a skeleton
crew. Among them is Kim, who is a medical

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:12.610
intern tending to a patient named Cliff. In
the waiting area, Daniel greets Ben and his

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:19.310
pregnant granddaughter, Maggie. They talk
about the fire and the town's lack of improvements.

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.130
In the middle of their conversation, Daniel
hears James shouting from his room until Dr.

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:29.570
Richard Powell calms him down with a sedative.
Dr. Powell suggests the man has undergone

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.530
some severe trauma. While examining James’s
body, Allison identifies him from his I.D.

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.720
and notes the multiple needle marks on his
arm.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.650
&nbsp;
Later that evening, as Daniel and Allison

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.100
catch up, Dr. Powell interrupts them to report
how it would take a while for James to recover

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.930
enough to disclose what happened to him. Before
leaving, Dr. Powell expresses his empathy

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.390
for the ex-couple who had just lost their
child, advising that they should take the

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.700
time to grieve and move on. While Daniel walks
along the hallway, he notices Beverly inside

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.890
Cliff’s room. Her face is morbidly flayed
as she stabs Cliff in the eye. She turns around

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.880
and proceeds to skin herself. Daniel attempts
to calm her down, but Beverly continues to

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.700
approach him, scissors in hand. She makes
a move to attack, forcing Daniel to shoot

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.480
her fatally. The loud gunshot prompts the
rest of the hospital staff to run to the room,

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.719
shocked to see their dead colleague. Still
fazed, Daniel explains what happened before

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:26.620
going to the bathroom, where he collapses
due to shock. While seizing, Daniel sees strange

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:32.150
visions of dark skies and barren land, where
a large triangular object looms. As Daniel

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.579
gains consciousness, Dr. Powell and Allison
assist him, informing him that a state trooper

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:41.719
is already there to take over the situation.
The two advise Daniel to rest, but he insists

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:43.969
on getting back on duty.
&nbsp;

00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:48.889
State Trooper Mitchell awaits Daniel in the
hallway, informing him about the bloodbath

00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:53.500
at the farmhouse. With James as their prime
suspect, Mitchell suggests putting him under

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.360
their custody. According to Mitchell, James
has a long list of drug-related issues and

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.930
may have given Beverly something for her to
act that way. Mitchell confiscates Daniel's

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.779
gun, disappointed with how he handled the
situation. With the phone lines down, Daniel

00:03:07.779 --> 00:03:12.760
heads outside to report&nbsp; Beverly's death
from his patrol car but receives no response.

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.089
In front of his car stands a cult member wearing
a white robe with a black triangle on the

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:21.569
face. When Daniel confronts him, the lights
start to shut down, distracting him from the

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:26.719
robed man who attacks him with a knife. Despite
being wounded, he manages to get up but sees

00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:31.209
other cult members slowly surrounding the
building. Daniel retreats to the hospital,

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:35.540
where the rest prevent him from bleeding out.
Meanwhile, Beverly’s body starts twitching

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.939
while a disturbing-looking creature comes
out of her mouth.

00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:43.089
When Daniel regains consciousness, the cult
members standing eerily with blades in their

00:03:43.089 --> 00:03:47.560
hands. With no way to call for backup, the
people in the hospital are suspicious of what

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:48.859
the cult wants.
&nbsp;

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:53.510
Suddenly, they hear a scream from one of the
rooms where they see James fighting for his

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:58.010
life. Handcuffed to the bed, James tries to
maintain the farthest distance from Beverly,

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.939
who has now transformed into a tentacled monster.
Confused by the sight, Mitchell freezes while

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:07.889
Daniel tries to get James out of the room.
After firing gunshots at the creature, who

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:12.459
seems immune to bullets, the three leave and
close the door behind them. Daniel gathers

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:17.040
the rest, arming himself with an ax as he
plots to fight their way out of the building.

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.400
The situation escalates when Vincent and Simon
enter the lobby and hold them at gunpoint,

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:26.199
commanding them to hand over James. All while
the creature is overtaking Beverly’s body.

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:31.250
James refuses to go with Vincent and Simon,
and in return, threatens to kill Maggie. The

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.379
concerned doctor tries to rescue Maggie by
approaching James, but he only gets stabbed

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:40.330
in the neck. Unbeknownst to them, the creature
creeps onto Mitchell, its tentacles enveloping

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:45.759
his body. Daniel attempts to rescue him, but
he's too late. The creature crushes Mitchell’s

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:50.490
eyes. The creature throws Daniel off just
as Vincent and Simon arrive. The two shoot

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.800
it on the head and chops it down until it
dies.

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.960
&nbsp;
Daniel rushes back to the others, asking everyone

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:01.539
to hide in the office as he handles the situation.
Vincent and Simon reach them, arguing with

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:06.409
Daniel. After the horrors the two have seen,
which resulted in Simon's injured vocal cords,

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:10.960
Vincent refuses to trust the group and attempts
to kill Daniel. Simon stops him from doing

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.629
so, thinking that they must work together
to escape the hospital. With no other information

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:19.590
other than the possibility of the creature
waking up again, they set Mitchell’s body

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:23.580
on fire and wheel it outside to prevent it
from taking the creature’s form. They head

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:28.190
to the office, finding Maggie close to labor.
Vincent's continued aggression causes the

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:32.969
rest to panic. Allison expresses to Daniel
the urgency to gather medical supplies in

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:37.509
the basement for Maggie’s delivery. Despite
the danger, Daniel relents but he needs to

00:05:37.509 --> 00:05:42.349
arm himself first. He plots with Vincent and
Simon to retrieve his shotgun from his patrol

00:05:42.349 --> 00:05:43.699
car.

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:47.910
In the dark, they find Daniel's car parked
farther than when he left it. The cult is

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:52.930
nowhere in sight. Meanwhile, the group transfers
Maggie to another room, where they lay her

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:58.189
down as she begins to go into labor. Not wanting
to wait anymore, Allison ventures to the basement

00:05:58.189 --> 00:06:04.259
alone to gather supplies. A resurrected Dr.
Powell stands behind her. Simultaneously,

00:06:04.259 --> 00:06:08.219
Daniel activates the car's strobe lights,
revealing the cult in front of them, hiding

00:06:08.219 --> 00:06:13.440
in the dark woods. One attacks Simon, and
Daniel saves him. They rush back inside the

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:14.849
hospital.
&nbsp;

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:19.330
As they arrive back in the building, Daniel
gets frustrated that Kim let Allison go alone,

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:23.870
so he makes his way to the basement to rescue
her. They notice the absence of Dr. Powell’s

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:27.819
body along the hallway, which used to lie
under the cover, but they continue to look

00:06:27.819 --> 00:06:32.789
for Allison anyway. In the basement, a phone
rings and reveals that Dr. Powell is on the

00:06:32.789 --> 00:06:37.800
other line, calmly revealing that he truly
knows the reason behind what causes the tentacled

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:42.580
creatures to appear out of the dead bodies.
In a safety box, Vincent browses through pictures

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:47.090
that indicate the doctor’s participation
in the vicious cult. Daniel gathers the medical

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:51.490
supplies needed and leaves Kim in charge of
Maggie’s procedures. The pressure takes

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:56.710
over Kim, putting her in a state of panic,
as she is still in training. Without a choice,

00:06:56.710 --> 00:07:01.629
Kim, Ben, and Maggie have to endure the fear
of being left alone, while Daniel, Vincent,

00:07:01.629 --> 00:07:05.930
and Simon interrogate James after finding
him among the photographs. Out of fear of

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:10.659
being tortured, James reveals that Dr. Powell
leads a group of people who engage in inhumane

00:07:10.659 --> 00:07:15.360
activities and has the power to transform
people. The three of them force the distressed

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:19.610
James to come with them down to the basement.
He becomes more afraid after seeing the building

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:21.879
surrounded by cult members.&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;

00:07:21.879 --> 00:07:25.620
With the help of Kim through a radio, she
leads them to the room they intend to go to,

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:30.550
but the signal becomes shaky. After some time,
Kim realizes that they took an unknown set

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:35.060
of stairs that might lead to a dangerous place.
As Allison regains her consciousness, she

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:39.129
finds herself on an operating table while
Dr. Powell explains that he found a new way

00:07:39.129 --> 00:07:45.250
to defy death. This stemmed from the devastating
loss of his daughter, Sarah, causing him to

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:50.229
resort to unconventional ways to maintain
life.&nbsp;Confused by his words, Allison remains

00:07:50.229 --> 00:07:54.840
immobile because of drugs injected into her.
She begs the doctor to spare her life, but

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:57.330
according to him, it is too late.
&nbsp;

00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:01.559
Now struggling to tend to Maggie, Kim has
completely lost communication with the others

00:08:01.559 --> 00:08:06.061
and is now forced to inject a pain reliever
on the pregnant young lady. Meanwhile, the

00:08:06.061 --> 00:08:10.819
group sees a room with a triangular symbol;
Daniel is determined to find out the room’s

00:08:10.819 --> 00:08:15.379
contents, despite Vincent’s protests not
to enter. In the operating room, Dr. Powell

00:08:15.379 --> 00:08:19.889
reveals that he will bring his daughter back
to life through Allison. With a flayed face,

00:08:19.889 --> 00:08:24.789
Dr. Powell uncovers Allison's body where something
rapidly grows inside of her. He says that

00:08:24.789 --> 00:08:28.370
she will turn into something remarkable just
as her stomach moves uncontrollably.&nbsp;

00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:32.690
&nbsp;
Back in the basement, Daniel, Simon, Vincent,

00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:37.250
and James enter the hidden room, surrounded
by deformed bodies, corpses brought back to

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:42.070
life by a sinister force. With disassembled
bodies, the creatures gravitate toward the

00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:46.810
group to harm them. The corpses fill them
with illusion, but Vincent, who fazed for

00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:51.930
a bit, snaps out of it. With monstrous appearances
and even superhuman strength, the corpses

00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:56.310
start attacking them. The four fight them
before taking shelter in some corners of the

00:08:56.310 --> 00:09:02.149
room. Not shortly after, James attacks Daniel,
but the officer manages to throw James off,

00:09:02.149 --> 00:09:04.850
allowing him to be dragged by a mangled creature.
&nbsp;

00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:10.000
Upstairs, Maggie grows weaker as time passes
by, and the more time she endures labor, the

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.350
paler her skin looks, indicating that she
might not last long. Fearful of the situation,

00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:19.769
Kim hesitates to perform an emergency C-section,
but Ben pleads with her to gather her strength

00:09:19.769 --> 00:09:24.420
and save his granddaughter. However, Maggie
stands up and slits her grandfather’s throat

00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:28.899
before saying that she is the one carrying
Dr. Powell’s unborn child. A sense of new

00:09:28.899 --> 00:09:34.060
strength has captivated her body as her delivery
nears. What was causing her pain is now fueling

00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:38.660
her strength. Kim looks at her with complete
fear, but Maggie says not to worry as everything

00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:43.370
will be fine. Maggie’s demeanor and personality
have completely shifted as if something or

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:48.550
someone is controlling her. Shortly after,
Kim sees the cult members enter the building,

00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:53.150
making her run, but is again trapped by some
who are by the door.&nbsp;She locks herself in

00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:55.010
a room to escape.
&nbsp;

00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:59.180
As the three men get separated in the basement,
Vincent and Simon hallucinate about being

00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:03.649
in their old home, where Vincent blames his
son for losing their family. After blurting

00:10:03.649 --> 00:10:08.160
out hurtful words to his son, he proceeds
to attack him. Simon lights a flare gun and

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:12.800
drives it into Vincent's chest, snapping them
both out of the illusion. After snapping back

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:18.759
to reality, Vincent apologizes to his son,
accepting his fate. Kim, hidden in the vents,

00:10:18.759 --> 00:10:24.009
tries to call Daniel for help, but the radio
isn't working. She stifles a scream as a cult

00:10:24.009 --> 00:10:29.110
member comes close. Along the dark hallways,
Daniel sees Allison inside the operating room

00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:33.250
in the full stages of the pregnancy, remembering
how devastated they were when they lost their

00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:38.240
child. Dr. Powell's voice echoes in Daniel's
mind, reminding him of how he looked relieved

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:43.111
upon learning that their child died. Instantly,
Allison transforms into a tentacled creature

00:10:43.111 --> 00:10:48.300
with slimy parts extending from her body.
Refusing to allow Allison to become a monster,

00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:51.990
he brutally attacks his wife’s mutated physique
with an ax.

00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:54.210
&nbsp;
Unconsciously, Daniel gets transported to

00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:58.470
a morgue with a giant glowing triangle where
Dr. Powell claims that he has defied God after

00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:03.820
finding the ability to conquer not just life
but also death. Moreover, he promises Daniel

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:08.390
that he can reunite with his child again if
and only if he is willing to die first. From

00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:13.019
behind, Maggie appears to stab Daniel before
approaching Dr. Powell, who now appears to

00:11:13.019 --> 00:11:17.959
be skinless. Endearingly, Maggie kneels before
him and looks with complete devotion as he

00:11:17.959 --> 00:11:23.050
recites a chant in front of the triangle which
opens. After, Dr. Powell turns back to Maggie

00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:27.199
again and touches her head as if to bless
her. Maggie sees visions of the creature in

00:11:27.199 --> 00:11:32.440
her body and panics. She screams until her
stomach explodes, where a giant, monstrous

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:36.970
creature is born. The doctor claims that it
is Sarah who has now been reincarnated.&nbsp;

00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:39.520
&nbsp;
Simon and Vincent shoot at the creature from

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:44.360
a distance, but it follows them and is ready
for bloody combat. The creature takes Vincent,

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:49.399
and Simon attempts to save him. After seeing
Simon nearly get dragged along, Vincent drenches

00:11:49.399 --> 00:11:54.750
it in isopropyl alcohol, ordering his son
to set them ablaze. Simon hesitates, unable

00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:59.660
to kill his father. Vincent urges him, seeing
a vision of his wife and baby behind his son

00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:05.030
just as the creature mutilates him. With sadness
in his eyes, Simon throws the flare and watches

00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:10.759
his father in such a tragic state. Simon retreats
into the vent, escaping the horror.

00:12:10.759 --> 00:12:15.120
At the same time, Dr. Powell informs Daniel
that he can be reunited with Allison if he

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:20.459
stops resisting and starts cooperating with
his astral abilities. However, Daniel refuses

00:12:20.459 --> 00:12:25.319
to join him and tackles him, causing them
to tumble into the void. Upstairs, the hallways

00:12:25.319 --> 00:12:30.050
shake as Simon runs from the monstrous creature.
As the walls close in on them, Simon leaps

00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:34.949
forward, barely escaping before getting trapped
inside. He checks behind him, finding the

00:12:34.949 --> 00:12:39.870
hospital looking normal. He's back to the
real world, where he reunites with Kim.

00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:45.000
At daybreak, the cult members have entirely
disappeared as if nothing happened. The void

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.529
has taken Dr. Powell and his followers away,
but Daniel and Allison hold hands in a different

00:12:49.529 --> 00:12:54.320
world under a black pyramid where they have
reincarnated. In this dark place, they remain

00:12:54.320 --> 00:13:04.569
unharmed spirits trapped in a void, unsure
if this is the end of them or just 

00:13:04.569 --> 00:13:07.449
the beginning.
