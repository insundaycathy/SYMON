00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.040
if there is a monster living inside your&nbsp;
smartphone that obsessively tries to befriend you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.920
how would you break it to him that you aren't&nbsp;
interested in this how to beat video we follow a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:15.680
haunted family define the threats and ultimately&nbsp;
figure out on how we could beat Larry and come&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:21.280
play we start off with eight-year-old Oliver&nbsp;
comfortably sleeping when he gets woken up by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:26.960
his smartphone he then decides to walk through his&nbsp;
house smashing his weird jelly hand against the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:32.720
walls and stands in the doorway of his mom's room&nbsp;
like he's the villain of this movie after getting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:38.080
his nightly diabetes type 2 dose he gets back to&nbsp;
his room where he finds his phone displaying this

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.920
he doesn't seem to be able to press it away which&nbsp;
is definitely an unusual thing we also don't know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.760
how it appeared in his phone either but i think&nbsp;
we can agree on Larry being an absolute weirdo&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:57.840
i mean if he wants friends he might would do&nbsp;
well to stop creeping people out at first sight

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:06.560
i am not so sure if closing the door was the right&nbsp;
decision here you practically trapped yourself in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.920
if screaming is too old school he could have sent&nbsp;
the whatsapp to his parents at the very least he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.880
blocked the door so the monster would first trip&nbsp;
and fall before he gets to him but all of that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.240
doesn't matter because that was just a dream an&nbsp;
interesting fact we learned though is that the kid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:28.000
here seems to have some sort of speak impairment&nbsp;
not allowing him to speak without a smartphone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.320
good job technology the next morning we witness&nbsp;
an argument between his parents and as usual the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:40.160
man is a problem but i get it he doesn't give the&nbsp;
impression to be very capable in raising his son&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:47.600
that is until he lures him with a laser pointer&nbsp;
back in my days they used candy at school oliver&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:53.360
participates quite normally in his class using&nbsp;
his smartphone to communicate all to the dislike&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.360 --> 00:02:00.480
of his fellow classmates not only is he the freak&nbsp;
of the class no he also gets to use a smartphone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:05.920
after class one of the kids asks him if he&nbsp;
wants to come and hang out which he aptly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.600
agrees to i mean this kid has a severe speech&nbsp;
impairment i can't imagine the difficulties&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.320
for him going through daily life how do you&nbsp;
even make friends with a condition like this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:22.320
so naturally oliver walks over to the meeting&nbsp;
point just to realize he got tricked into a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:28.800
trap imagine not being able to defend yourself&nbsp;
with speech and then even get bullied for it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:34.320
but something interesting happens in that scene we&nbsp;
could see that something was observing the event&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:40.160
from inside his phone giving me the impression&nbsp;
that we may get to see some revenge later on from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:46.400
what we know it could be larry and if it is i'm&nbsp;
starting to like larry they could be a great match&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.680
now i don't want to jump to any conclusions yet&nbsp;
but the movie does tell us that electronic devices&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:57.200
have something to do with larry but it is also&nbsp;
true that spongebob is oddly often involved too&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.280
now having done extensive research i&nbsp;
have found out that larry could also be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:08.240
spongebob's cousin we cut to oliver's dead and&nbsp;
his demanding job as a parking lot manager he also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:13.680
has obvious problems with his chair denying&nbsp;
him focus to finish his crossword challenge&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:21.360
as he tries to fix his seat he hears an odd sound&nbsp;
now at first i thought there was someone knocking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.160
on the glass window to get a parking ticket but&nbsp;
it seems like it came from the lost and found&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:32.880
box over there when he opens the box all he finds&nbsp;
is a tablet in need for some electric juice well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:39.280
we start to understand that larry or larry's seem&nbsp;
to be somehow connected to tablets and the likes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:45.840
at this point it would be impossible for him&nbsp;
to even remotely consider something like this

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.960
well that's weird i have never seen a sliding door&nbsp;
being pushed open by wind and let's be honest ever&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.960 --> 00:04:01.040
since supernatural this series flickering light&nbsp;
bulbs are pretty much always indicating paranormal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.680
activity it is obvious that he isn't fan of&nbsp;
the horror genre nor does he seem to be on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:11.200
the paranormal subreddit i think we can safely&nbsp;
conclude by now that this whole family seems to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:17.600
be haunted by something and with something i mean&nbsp;
probably larry when he arrives back home he hands&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:23.280
over the tablet to oliver his wife doesn't seem&nbsp;
to be much happy about it seems like she got some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:28.960
serious insecurity problems meanwhile oliver&nbsp;
is happily playing with his new gadget until

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:36.320
there is a weird noise coming from his closet&nbsp;
he doesn't seem to mind though and continues&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:41.600
playing with his new tablet since he is autistic&nbsp;
there might be some sort of explanation for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:47.040
that type of reaction autistic people usually&nbsp;
struggle with appropriate emotional response

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.720
time to pack your stuff and leave your&nbsp;
room whatever the heck that was it wasn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:00.400
anything friendly and if it was it seriously&nbsp;
lacks social skills perhaps it's an autistic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:05.920
monster we don't know yet but i would stay in&nbsp;
this room for a million bucks i'm not sure if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:11.600
oliver just doesn't get it or if he's just too&nbsp;
curious about it at first i thought closing the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:17.520
closet door just like that probably won't suffice&nbsp;
to keep larry from creeping but at second thought&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:22.560
it might have been a pretty smart move because&nbsp;
whenever we have seen larry it was in darkness&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:27.920
like on the parking lot and now in oliver's room&nbsp;
and back on the field it was bright daylight&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:34.080
perhaps preventing him to intervene the point is&nbsp;
we don't know yet for sure but my best guess would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:39.840
be larry has either something to do with light&nbsp;
or electricity the next day the spook ain't over&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:49.040
hello time to change your tablet provider this&nbsp;
wasn't alexa nor siri talking to you oliver but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:55.600
to be fair larry has a point here oliver's parents&nbsp;
seem to be quite a bit bothered by his condition&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:01.040
the people around him want him to be normal yet&nbsp;
they treat him like he isn't in my experience that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:06.640
doesn't work if they treated him like a normal&nbsp;
person it would be much easier for him to adapt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:13.040
and actually be normal the two main possibilities&nbsp;
here are larry isn't bad and really just wants a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:18.880
friend or larry is that candyman in a sketchy&nbsp;
van around an elementary school oliver picks up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:25.040
the tablet and throws it into the cupboard under&nbsp;
the stairs not sure if that helps the movie hasn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:30.480
told us much about larry yet besides the fact&nbsp;
that he seems to be somewhat connected to electric&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:36.080
devices and likes to creep on little kids but&nbsp;
if you really should be connected to the tablet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:42.560
perhaps the best choice here would have been to&nbsp;
either break it or get rid of it completely i.e&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:49.360
burn it dissolve it or throw it into the mariana&nbsp;
trench when the night breaks in oliver's mom had&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:54.800
the brilliant idea to surprise her autistic&nbsp;
son with a sleepover of his three bullies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:01.600
and the award for the worst mom goes to yes&nbsp;
this woman during the night one of the kids&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:08.720
checks out the cupboard under the stairs thinking&nbsp;
it's oliver's secret candy stash nope he finds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:15.280
the haunted tablet and starts reading the tale&nbsp;
of larry larry just wants a friend the story&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:20.720
mentions that larry comes from another world&nbsp;
implying he is a supernatural being out of reach&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:27.680
he isn't from the world you know secondly the&nbsp;
story tells us that larry watches our world&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:33.520
through windows which connects his realm to ours&nbsp;
since there were several scenes in which we could&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:38.640
witness larry looking through oliver's smartphone&nbsp;
i think it is safe to conclude that the windows&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:44.880
mentioned are the screens of electronic devices to&nbsp;
turn those windows into doors and the last part of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:50.480
the story mentions how you must know larry's whole&nbsp;
story in order to turn the windows into doors&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:58.320
what does that mean that means he just screwed&nbsp;
up in the following events we see oliver holding&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:03.840
up his tablet with the main camera turned on&nbsp;
pointing at the kitchen while larry seems to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:09.440
be only visible on the screen he doesn't appear&nbsp;
in front of the naked eye that means he either&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:14.720
only exists inside electronic devices or he&nbsp;
is invisible why would you want to read the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:20.800
next pages you just write a super creepy story&nbsp;
while seven light bulbs exploded all around you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:26.880
if that wasn't a red flag i don't know what is and&nbsp;
what about that ghoul-like thing cowering in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:34.000
corner of your kitchen "what the sh*t is that"&nbsp;
look i wouldn't want to be his friend either&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.520
and as much as i would like to say that that kid&nbsp;
is nuts i would have probably done the exact same&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:45.840
thing because something like this just can't be&nbsp;
real right i'm going to take a wild guess and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:51.760
say sleepovers at this house probably won't be&nbsp;
a thing anymore at least we could figure out a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:57.600
few interesting facts about larry for instance&nbsp;
that you really don't want to be his friend&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:02.800
the best solution for now would be getting&nbsp;
rid of all electronic devices but for that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:08.160
the mother must know about the strange events&nbsp;
taking place if she doesn't know and oliver&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:13.520
starts a tantrum and breaks all electronic&nbsp;
devices she'd probably be quick in giving him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:19.680
over to a daycare that means she must experience&nbsp;
what the kids have experienced last night first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:25.200
luckily the haunted tablet is at home when&nbsp;
she's replacing the broken light bulbs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:30.720
and it doesn't take long until she too starts&nbsp;
to understand that something just isn't right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:40.400
whoa flickering light bulbs is one thing&nbsp;
but a cleaned and fixed living room is on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:45.600
a whole other level if that would happen to&nbsp;
me i'd be heading through the nearest window&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:50.960
but not this woman though she first wants&nbsp;
to investigate let me make one thing clear&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:57.680
sherlock it isn't possible to have 7 light bulbs&nbsp;
fixed in 14 seconds without making any noise&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:03.840
even the ideal electrician champion couldn't do&nbsp;
that if you're hearing his footsteps like these

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:13.200
then you better go for a run of course she&nbsp;
doesn't because if she does there would be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:18.480
no need for this video our lady here wants to&nbsp;
find the intruder herself so she looks through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:26.480
her house and eventually gets to speak to him say&nbsp;
goodbye to oliver yeah the classic tape over the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:32.320
front cam thing if i were her i would have done&nbsp;
that since the father has brought home this thing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:38.480
who knows who owned that device before it was lost&nbsp;
and found having creeps spying on people and kids&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:44.720
is a real thing and happens daily she finally&nbsp;
storms out and drives over to the school to pick&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:50.320
up oliver which i think is the best possible thing&nbsp;
to do here when somebody wants to take away your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:57.520
son the most important thing is to have your son&nbsp;
by your side at all times yes even in restrooms&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:03.200
on the way out she actually takes the time and&nbsp;
tells oliver what is happening kudos to her for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:09.280
that one i didn't see that coming i personally&nbsp;
believe that appropriate communication is key&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:15.360
for almost all scenarios while she's explaining&nbsp;
the situation to oliver who still knows more than&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:20.800
her at this point she gets a call from the mother&nbsp;
of the kid that got assaulted by larry the night&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:27.200
before they rush over to her place and find a&nbsp;
traumatized boy who stopped speaking ever since&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:31.680
the kid eventually comes around and tells&nbsp;
the full story of what happened that night&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:37.280
and that he lied about oliver being the&nbsp;
perpetrator he tried to kill me something&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:42.800
unnatural is happening whether you can explain it&nbsp;
or not and whatever happens is somehow related to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:48.640
the story of larry and the tablet oliver's status&nbsp;
brought home even though it is still likely hard&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:54.240
to believe that a supernatural monster is trying&nbsp;
to get your son this is not the time to head back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:59.920
home and pack your stuff it's been only a couple&nbsp;
of hours since you have heard menacing footsteps&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:05.760
inside this very house why would you even&nbsp;
consider coming back here besides your friend's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:11.600
kid just told you half an hour ago that he almost&nbsp;
got killed by an invisible monster that calls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:17.520
himself larry i don't think you have thought this&nbsp;
through can anybody please tell this woman to stop&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:22.400
leaving her autistic eight-year-old son behind&nbsp;
you shouldn't even be here in the first place and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:27.840
if for some reason jesus himself has ordered you&nbsp;
to visit that house you want to make it as quick&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:33.840
as possible without leaving your son out of sight&nbsp;
that's exactly what i'm talking about but this kid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:40.000
here is so lonely he actually takes the bait if&nbsp;
that was me i would have frozen in terror come to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:45.840
think of it larry might be only targeting lonely&nbsp;
people to begin with and if that's the case then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:52.560
oliver needs a real friend asap but to be fair&nbsp;
using the camera of the tablet is a smart idea&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:58.480
and seemingly the only way to see larry we still&nbsp;
don't know how larry exists or how he travels&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:03.920
but if throwing away all your electronic devices&nbsp;
doesn't help you shielding off this school-like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:08.960
thing then you would have just thrown away the&nbsp;
only means that would allow you to actually see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:15.120
him if larry can only be seen through screens&nbsp;
of electronic devices night vision goggles or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:21.360
smart glasses might be a great fit walking around&nbsp;
holding your phone with stretched out arms is a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:27.520
bad choice since it limits your ability to defend&nbsp;
yourself and barehandedly fighting larry seems to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:33.360
be rather unrealistic for now i'm strongly leaning&nbsp;
towards getting rid of all electronic devices and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:39.280
do some research at the father's place oliver's&nbsp;
mom tries her best to tell him about the strange&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:44.560
events taking place i guess talking about&nbsp;
flickering light bulbs while turning on and off&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:50.160
the lights as a reference might not be the most&nbsp;
convincing strategy how about looking into his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:55.440
eyes tell him that there is something seriously&nbsp;
wrong and it has something to do with the tablet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:55.440 --> 00:14:01.760
he has brought home a few days ago sometimes to&nbsp;
get across a message tough measures must be taken&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:07.360
playing poltergeist isn't one of them predictably&nbsp;
the conversation about the kid's safety shifts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:13.120
into a power play between the parents although&nbsp;
he isn't entirely wrong about the sleep thing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:19.280
being overly exhausted is a bad basis for fighting&nbsp;
paranormal phenomena but the worst thing they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:24.080
could have done at this point was splitting up&nbsp;
she should have insisted on staying together&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:29.840
until they have figured out a better solution we&nbsp;
cut back to the parking lot where oliver's dad is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:35.360
practicing his challenging duty everything is&nbsp;
all fun and play until he pulls out the tablet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:41.600
completely ignoring his son's concerns and&nbsp;
the moms rant from before he tells oliver&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:48.400
not to worry and promises to protect him a full&nbsp;
second later he leaves him behind to pick up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:55.040
some tools from the car i am no parent counselor&nbsp;
but i'm pretty sure oliver's safety is best kept&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:55.040 --> 00:15:00.640
when being in your sight at all times whether&nbsp;
you believe it's a monster that is after your son&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:06.320
or a human creep i don't think it makes a big&nbsp;
difference in how you handle things meanwhile&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:11.760
oliver walks happily into the dark parking lot&nbsp;
completely ignoring the fact that an invisible&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:16.880
monster is trying to murder him i'm starting&nbsp;
to think that those people just don't give a f-

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:25.760
can somebody please tell this guy to stop&nbsp;
talking to his son as if he were a pet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:29.680
he starts to remind me of the&nbsp;
moronic blonde girl in scary movie 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:37.200
let's get in those ears as the dad checks&nbsp;
out the empty parking lot through the camera&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:41.840
of the tablet for the longest period ever&nbsp;
his son gets strangled in the background

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:50.400
that took a while at least he gets it now i&nbsp;
just don't think he will make it to the ending&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:54.160
with more luck than brain they make&nbsp;
it back home where they finally start&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:56.880
to discuss what larry is and how they can beat him

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:05.840
that was about time oliver for once makes a smart&nbsp;
move and draws larry's existence onto paper i am&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:11.280
not sure what to do with that information yet&nbsp;
but perhaps breaking the windows ie screens of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:16.880
each device is a logical conclusion that prevents&nbsp;
larry from entering the real world but something&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:22.640
just doesn't make sense here if larry can't get to&nbsp;
oliver yet then how did he almost kill him an hour&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:28.160
ago he clearly can engage in physical interaction&nbsp;
with this world so why would he need to enter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:34.000
this world in completion first the only possible&nbsp;
reason that i can think of is that larry doesn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:40.080
want to kill nor harm anyone he truly just wants&nbsp;
a friend and for that it seems like he must enter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:46.080
this world first in order to be able to carry over&nbsp;
someone to his realm if that's the case then the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:51.600
best and quickest way to beat larry would have&nbsp;
been to never read his story in the first place&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:55.680
but since that has already happened&nbsp;
and the connection has been established&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:55.680 --> 00:17:01.040
getting rid of all electronic devices would be&nbsp;
the next best thing but that would mean you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:07.040
never get too close to any electronic devices&nbsp;
ever again which is just not a feasible solution&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:13.520
in this day and age the next day oliver's mom&nbsp;
confronts his therapist with the story of larry&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:19.600
yeah i kid you not this woman legit thought&nbsp;
that that would be a good idea if i were that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:24.480
therapist i would have called child support&nbsp;
quicker than this woman can spell larry&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:29.920
to be honest apart from close relatives and&nbsp;
very good friends i doubt that anyone would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:35.120
ever take you seriously if you shared this story&nbsp;
well we're hoping that that's over now because we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:40.080
destroyed that thing the way she's proudly&nbsp;
saying that they have destroyed that thing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:45.360
makes me want to throw up she doesn't seem to&nbsp;
realize that each and every smartphone screen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:51.760
is a possible door for larry to climb through the&nbsp;
story of larry made this abundantly clear though&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:56.720
at school oliver and his former friend byron&nbsp;
reconnect through the incidents that happened&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:56.720 --> 00:18:03.040
with larry oliver realizes that it was his mom's&nbsp;
fault and that byron and he broke their friendship&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:09.040
off because of her yep this woman sure as hell&nbsp;
won't get the mvp in this movie but seeing oliver&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:14.560
forming a friendship with another kid makes me&nbsp;
wonder if that's a possible way to beat larry&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:20.160
after all larry only targets lonely people so&nbsp;
perhaps getting out of that lonely bubble might&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:25.920
shifts away larry's intention in wanting you as&nbsp;
a friend but it could also be the case that once&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:31.840
larry chooses you to become his bff it doesn't&nbsp;
matter if you suddenly join the football club&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:37.520
enough talk i think it's time to get rid of some&nbsp;
characters oliver's dad gets haunted by larry&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:42.720
proving that larry can look through any device&nbsp;
with a screen and come think of it it makes total&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:49.120
sense if smartphone screens or actual windows&nbsp;
connecting larry's realm with ours then that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:55.360
would mean that his realm is actual electricity&nbsp;
and that he travels through electromagnetic fields&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:55.360 --> 00:19:00.880
that would explain the electric interferences&nbsp;
whenever larry is present if that theory turns&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:06.960
out to be true then that would mean that anything&nbsp;
capable and shielding of electromagnetic radiation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:11.920
would shield off larry as well i don't know&nbsp;
about y'all but i'm getting my tinfoil hats ready

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:21.840
i don't know how he escaped the situation but oh&nbsp;
boy aren't these people lucky he even finds a way&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:28.000
to lock in the creep just bad he moves through&nbsp;
electricity huh while i agree it is dangerous&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:34.480
to jump out of a moving vehicle having a monster&nbsp;
on your passenger seat is just as discomforting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:40.640
the only chance oliver's dad had in this situation&nbsp;
was to stop the car and run into the woods to a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:47.120
place far off any electricity it also confused&nbsp;
me at first as to why he would go back to work&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:53.440
so quickly after the events of the past few days&nbsp;
but that wasn't necessarily a bad thing to do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:59.600
distraction often helps coping with traumatizing&nbsp;
events but sending your son to school while not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:04.800
being supervised on the other hand wasn't as&nbsp;
smart all three of them should have sticked&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:10.560
together for at least a few days just to make&nbsp;
sure that things have gone back to normal again&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:15.600
after they had destroyed the tablet oliver's&nbsp;
mom gets a call about her husband having been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:21.360
involved in a car crash and remains unresponsive&nbsp;
she inevitably understands that larry isn't bound&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:26.400
to any specific device and gets back in&nbsp;
where larry talks to her through the tv&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:31.760
he's saying that he won't stop until they finish&nbsp;
reading his story that's a pretty needy monster&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:37.840
this larry he then goes on about how the world&nbsp;
only looks at their screens and not each other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:44.240
and that that loneliness itself creates him&nbsp;
i think what he's trying to say is get a life&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:50.560
how do you think i would feel if larry took all&nbsp;
of her i love how she's trying to reason herself&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:56.000
out of this situation but i don't think larry&nbsp;
gives a f- she then attempts to rip off the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:02.240
tv from the wall and throws it onto the streets&nbsp;
along with any other electronic devices she finds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:08.720
heck she even goes as far as to screw out each&nbsp;
and every light bulb i like how she suddenly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:14.720
becomes so thorough in her actions but perhaps&nbsp;
switching off the fuse box would have been quicker&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:20.000
if larry needs electricity to exist turning off&nbsp;
the juice at the source is the best solution&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:27.840
can you just be normal for one second meanwhile&nbsp;
oliver has lost his mind but to be fair&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:33.360
those flickering lights almost cost me a seizure&nbsp;
when i was watching the movie i know that this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:38.800
is a stressful situation but can we not forget&nbsp;
that this is all her fault if she didn't lie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:44.400
about his only friend not wanting to be his friend&nbsp;
anymore larry wouldn't even have appeared in this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:50.880
household the key to success in this movie was&nbsp;
literally to accept this one kid the way he is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:59.680
while treating him as normal as possible without&nbsp;
making him feel like he's an alien the crazy thing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:05.280
here is that the whole neighborhood just suffered&nbsp;
a complete outage yet larry seems to be still&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:10.960
chilling around here either we made a mistake in&nbsp;
our theory or larry is about to fully enter this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:16.560
world and the interference grows so strong&nbsp;
that the local circuit completely overloaded&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:21.360
looks like that seems to be the case hey at&nbsp;
least you can see him now with naked eyes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:27.360
this would be a good time to start wearing your&nbsp;
tin foil hats the truth is none of them has put&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:32.320
in the slightest effort in understanding&nbsp;
what larry is or how he can be beaten&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:37.520
knowing that he travels through electromagnetic&nbsp;
fields and is closely related to those is a pretty&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:42.720
big hint after finding that out they should&nbsp;
have contacted the nearest physics professor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:47.840
while he probably would not have believed them&nbsp;
neither he could have still given them valuable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:54.000
information on how all of that stuff works&nbsp;
but it's too late for that now and no hiding&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:59.120
under your bed will not save you from larry's&nbsp;
entitlement of becoming your friend i don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:04.480
want to be as smart as but the first thing i would&nbsp;
have done after seeing this is pouring a bucket of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:10.320
water over larry and see what happens if larry is&nbsp;
made out of electric radiation then he shouldn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:15.920
be able to get to you when you are inside a&nbsp;
faraday cage while living inside such a cage&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:21.920
might not be possible 24 7 it should be possible&nbsp;
to have one ready inside your house for whenever&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:28.080
larry starts creeping again kind of like emergency&nbsp;
bunkers and sellers of certain houses obviously&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:33.920
bringing in electronic devices would cancel the&nbsp;
cage's ability to keep you safe but if larry has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:39.600
a period of excessive desires of wanting to become&nbsp;
your friend again and he just won't leave anymore&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:45.920
perhaps a propane stove and other non-electronic&nbsp;
survival gear would be best kept inside this cage&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:52.400
at all times along with some canned food and water&nbsp;
reserves oliver and his mom don't have that luxury&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:57.920
though and need to do the next best thing escape&nbsp;
to a place where there are no immediate electric&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:03.280
sources around they make it to the field where&nbsp;
oliver got bullied earlier in the movie but lost&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:09.600
his phone somewhere in the tall grass through&nbsp;
this device larry appears and chases down both&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:15.040
in the end oliver's mom sacrifices herself&nbsp;
and becomes larry's friend instead of oliver&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:21.600
good luck to larry let's recap and see&nbsp;
how they could have acted differently&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:27.520
larry first appeared sometime after oliver has&nbsp;
lost his only friend byron and thus became very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:34.400
socially isolated this caused him to suffer from&nbsp;
severe loneliness this loneliness attracted larry&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:39.840
the movie also told us that byron and oliver&nbsp;
were pretty close friends and that that small&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:44.560
fight which they had would have never caused&nbsp;
them to break off their friendship the movie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:50.880
depicts quite well from the start that oliver's&nbsp;
mom struggles a lot with oliver's condition if i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:55.920
wouldn't know better i think she would have&nbsp;
been the better candidate to enter therapy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:55.920 --> 00:25:00.320
if she could have handled her insecurities&nbsp;
better she would have never caused oliver&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:06.000
to lose his only friend which in return would&nbsp;
have never resulted in larry targeting oliver&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:11.600
after larry has appeared there were several&nbsp;
events that shed light on what larry is oliver's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:17.600
mom herself told oliver's therapist midway through&nbsp;
the movie that larry traveled through electricity&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:22.560
which turned out to be true if she had this&nbsp;
knowledge in her hand she could have taken&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:28.480
appropriate measurements to prevent any further&nbsp;
damage done by larry for instance prepare tinfoil&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:34.880
armory and tinfoil spares if you have better ideas&nbsp;
on how to beat larry let me know in the comments&nbsp;&nbsp;
