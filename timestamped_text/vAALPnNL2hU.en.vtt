00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.630
If you got lucky with that Tinder date, only
to wake up under a desolate bridge tied up

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:11.650
in a wheelchair, and your lover told you they
cursed you with a sexually transmitted demon

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:13.650
that is going to come after you.

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.340
That it could look like anyone, but it never
stops, it just follows you until it kills

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:20.340
you.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.570
What do you do?

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:29.810
In this video on Nerd Explains, I’ll tell
you: How to Kill, the Monster from, It Follows.

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:34.809
In the movie, your lover is kind enough to
actually show you the entity that is after

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:39.809
you, AKA a naked woman shuffling towards you
under a bridge at night.

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.320
They then take you home so you can have a
head start avoiding this thing.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:50.109
There is no doubt in your mind that something
is coming for you considering what you saw,

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:52.620
but also that you might be certifiably crazy.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.929
Either way, you need to figure out what to
do

00:00:55.929 --> 00:01:00.500
Right before we jump in though, if you find
these types of videos entertaining, consider

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.210
clicking the like and subscribe buttons as
it really helps me to make more.

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.229
Before your date runs away, you have to convince
them that you can fight this thing, but you

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.580
need to know what you are dealing with and
stick together.

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.770
So, what do they know about this thing?

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:22.200
They tell you it slowly walks towards you,
never sleeps, never stops, until it gets close

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.450
enough to turn you into a pretzel or otherwise
brutally kill you.

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.540
It can take the form of anyone.

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:35.560
It kills in a chain, and if you have sex with
someone you pass it on them an so forth.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.539
Nobody can see the entity but the victims.

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:42.950
As far as they know, none of the other victims
have attempted to stop it, they’ve all just

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.520
ran or passed it on.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.149
Just like this punk bitch did to you.

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:50.340
Wait a second.. this thing is basically a
discount Pennywise..

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:56.200
Anyways, it seems obvious you should call
the cops, I mean, this pretty much seems like

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.600
a crazy stalker serial killer.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:04.170
But you’ve never seen old ladies shuffle
towards you in public, coldly and unceasingly

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:10.479
staring into your eyes, what stalker does
that, what stalker can change forms, or is

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.820
it multiple stalkers, this whole thing is
fucking crazy.

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:18.459
And the other victim is adamant that nobody
else can see it but you.

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:23.400
If that’s true the police will think you’re
crazy and probably detain you, which will

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.709
get you killed.

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:30.470
You need to buy some time to think and make
a plan, but first you need to avoid getting

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:31.470
killed.

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.040
You can keep it at a distance by walking.

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.379
So with the other victim, walk to an open
area away from people, you don’t want to

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:44.640
be indoors and get trapped or bump into the
entity accidentally.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:50.330
Watch for any naked elderly women or deceased
family members shuffling towards you.

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:56.019
Get to your car, fill it up with gas, energy
drinks so you don’t get tired and doze off,

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:00.989
snacks, pull some ATM money out, and start
driving, just anywhere.

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:04.750
Now you need to prove to yourself that you
aren’t crazy.

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.849
Call a friend or family member.

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:10.160
Tell them to meet you at an isolated location.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.580
Tell them it’s serious and you need their
help.

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.860
Don’t make them panic and call the police,
that would just complicate the situation.

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.290
You just need to figure out if you’re crazy
or not.

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.220
Once they arrive, tell them you think someone
is after you.

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.840
Once the entity appears, point it out.

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:33.459
Once your friend tells you they don’t see
the thing, you’re probably going to realize,

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:40.610
holy shit, either I am crazy or this thing
really is invisible to non-victims.

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:43.180
Grab your drink and throw it at the entity.

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:49.750
It bounces off an invisible object from the
perspective of your friend.

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:55.719
That confirms that this thing is a real physical
being, you learn it’s invisible to everyone

00:03:55.719 --> 00:04:07.349
but the victims, and very importantly, you
know you’re not crazy.

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:11.719
This isn’t a crazy stalker, this is something
unnatural.

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:14.219
Get back to your car and get on the road again.

00:04:14.219 --> 00:04:15.239
What can you do?

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:20.810
If you just start having sex with randos,
you are effectively killing tons of people,

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:26.039
and even if you’re a sociopath, you have
no idea when the entity kills its way up the

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:32.860
chain back to you, you lose all awareness
and give it the complete element of surprise.

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:37.280
You have to look over your shoulder for the
rest of your life.

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.300
Every time you go to sleep you could wake
up dead.

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:48.229
You could probably make traveling work, but
again, the sheer mental burden of having to

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:52.630
look over your shoulder for the rest of your
life will destroy you.

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:58.120
Even if you can sustainably travel around
avoiding the entity for the rest of your life,

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:03.090
you can’t really have sex morally, and you
don’t know if this entity can change the

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:04.150
rules.

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:10.169
Who says it has to walk slowly, who says it
can’t wait for you when you get back.

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:12.530
You could get on a boat and go to sea.

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:17.390
But if you’re wrong about the entity’s
ability to swim, it’s speed, or anything

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:23.020
else, and you turn around and see the monster
climbing onto the boat while you're anchored

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:24.039
at sea.

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:25.590
You are fucked.

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:30.080
You could try to trap it by enlisting some
friends to help dig a hole in the ground in

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:35.949
a remote field, then knock the monster into
the hole and pour concrete on top of it.

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:41.229
You don’t know how strong this thing is
or what its shapeshifting abilities are, or

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:43.530
if it will sense the trap and avoid it.

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:49.970
It can turn into a child or a tall man, maybe
it could do some T1000 terminator shit to

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:51.180
ooze out of the concrete.

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:56.060
You’d constantly have to check if the entity
got out of it eventually.

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:58.759
You still wouldn’t be able to live in peace.

00:05:58.759 --> 00:06:04.060
You could try drawing it out to a remote area
and gun it down, but you’ll find out that

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:07.860
doesn’t put it down for good, and what do
you do with the body?

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:09.301
I wouldn't get close to it.

00:06:09.301 --> 00:06:10.301
Not to mention, this thing has invisibility,
and not just traditional invisibility.

00:06:10.301 --> 00:06:11.301
If two people are observing the entity simultaneously,
and one is afflicted while the other is not,

00:06:11.301 --> 00:06:12.301
this entity's visibility is different for
both observers.

00:06:12.301 --> 00:06:13.301
The entity can also find you anywhere, anytime,
no matter what.

00:06:13.301 --> 00:06:14.301
It doesn’t have NSA level access, it just
knows.

00:06:14.301 --> 00:06:15.301
How.

00:06:15.301 --> 00:06:16.301
Both of these things are theoretically impossible.

00:06:16.301 --> 00:06:17.301
The resounding consensus in your mind is that
you have no idea what you’re dealing with.

00:06:17.301 --> 00:06:18.301
I think we can admit that when you’re faced
with a supernatural demon that seemingly defies

00:06:18.301 --> 00:06:20.580
the laws of physics, you’re not smart enough
to figure a way out of this.

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:22.850
So go buy a paintball gun at walmart.

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:27.620
Drive to a police station and get the attention
of the police once the entity is close.

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:28.620
Make sure your friends have cameras running
too.

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:31.780
Once the entity is close, light it up with
paint and film it.

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:36.580
The entity will now be visible to everyone
at the police station, social media, the news,

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:40.280
and within 24 hours the whole planet will
be aware of this entity.

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:46.590
Once the human race is collectively aware
of an entity that has incomprehensible powers

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:51.860
yet wastes it by walking around killing dumb
teens and street hookers, we can begin to

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:52.860
defeat it.

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:58.569
It’s a bit out of your hands at this point,
as they’d probably taze the entity for resisting

00:06:58.569 --> 00:07:02.710
and throw it in a hulk cage that's monitored
24/7.

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:08.919
But how will the big brains discard the monster
after researching and stealing its technology?

00:07:08.919 --> 00:07:09.930
Off the top of my head:

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:16.350
I mean i’m positive we will test every form
of weapons or conceived method of dematerializing

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:37.380
the entity, and something will work.

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:40.950
I mean a kid with a revolver could incapacitate
it.

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:46.419
If we can’t kill it conventionally, we can
continuously incapacitate it indefinitely.

00:07:46.419 --> 00:07:48.470
The most extreme option though.

00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:55.530
Is Test SpaceX’s latest rocket delivery
system by ejecting the payload on a trajectory

00:07:55.530 --> 00:07:59.789
with the sun or Andromeda, or preferably a
black hole.

00:07:59.789 --> 00:08:04.690
With this entity’s matter entering a black
hole, I think you can pat yourself on the

00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:07.449
back and get a good night’s rest.

00:08:07.449 --> 00:08:08.790
What do you think?

00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:13.350
How would you kill the entity from It Follows,
let me know in the comments.

00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:17.129
And while you’re at it, let me know what
other movies or games you want me to cover

00:08:17.129 --> 00:08:18.129
like this.

00:08:18.129 --> 00:08:37.829
Thanks for watching, later.
