00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:05.520
Welcome to Cinema Summary, ladies and gentlemen.

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.950
Do you ever ever feel like your friends are
acting weird and different?

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.110
What if it’s not them.

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:10.420
What if it's paranormal?

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:12.740
What if it's the comet that's passing by?

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:14.820
This is Coherence (2013).

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.360
We first open to a woman, Emily, driving to
a reunion dinner with her friends while talking

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:20.920
on the phone with her boyfriend

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.610
When Emily finally gets to the house, their
connection cuts out and then

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:27.340
her phone screen cracks in her hand for no reason.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.340
Inside, Emily reunites with Mike, Beth, and
Lee

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.980
and mentions that her phone broke and thinks
it’s due to “Miller’s Comet”.

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.740
Which is supposed to be passing over them
tonight,

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:38.120
which according to Emily produces a radiation

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.640
that could break electronic devices like her phone

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.000
So a quick rundown of this film is that this is a science fiction movie about

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.340
8 people in a house, and a comet that's passing by

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.480
and the effect that this comet has on these people

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.880
Emily’s phone was broken by the comet's radiation

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.400
and the comet is only now starting take effect because its passing by.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.000
But we're gonna see that it can do more than just break phones

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.620
We find out that their friend Amir is bringing
Laurie.

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.520
and Emily isn’t isn’t happy about this

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.660
since Laurie dated Kevin, Emily’s now-boyfriend.

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.660
So Beth offers her own brand of tranquilizers
that could help Emily take the edge off.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.130
It’s full of natural herbs and ketamine
and in case Emily wants to relax

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.189
it will be here in the kitchen and Beth puts
the ketamine down and picks up a plant and

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:19.530
asks Lee where she bought it.

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.240
"Galaxy that thrift store"

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.120
Now keep this sentence in
mind because it comes back later.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.040
But their conversation is cut short after
Kevin and Hugh arrive.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.520
Kevin being Emily’s boyfriend and Hugh being
Beth’s husband.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.340
And a few moments later, Amir and Laurie arrive

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.680
As everyone goes to the dinner table,

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.920
Laurie and Kevin share an awkward "hi" together

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.240
But regardless of that, it's time to eat

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.400
As they’re having dinner, no one is able
to get reception on their cell phones

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.500
and it gets them talking about comet.

00:01:46.503 --> 00:01:49.770
Especially Emily who knows a lot about comets.

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.790
Like how in Finland, after a comet passed,
people began going a little crazy.

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.520
In particular, a woman called the police telling
them that ‘her husband’

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.640
wasn't 'her husband’ since she had killed him yesterday.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.140
But the police couldn’t arrest her since
her husband was alive.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:04.660
And also right next to her

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.460
And from there, the conversation turns from comets

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.580
To Beth’s sister, someone who Amir had never heard of until now

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.380
After that Mike asks Laurie what’s she been up to and
it’s pretty impressive: she’s busy with

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.360
Outreach programs with at-risk youths but
that confuses him.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.560
Mike’s pretty sure Laurie was teaching yoga. Spanish yoga.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.380
and Laurie defensively asks Mike what he does.

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.000
and well, he’s an out-of-work actor who at one point

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.710
was a part of the TV show Roswell.

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:35.860
A show Laurie loves except she doesn’t recognize
Mike even though he was the main character,

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.920
a fact that everyone at the table seems to
know except her.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.840
Which is pretty odd.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.480
Hugh then reveals that his phone is cracked and broken

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.740
just like Emily’s phone: It no longer works.

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:51.500
In fact none of their phones work and even
the computer’s internet is nonfunctional.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.860
Which is worrying since Hugh wanted to call
his brother

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.220
whose a bit of a science geek

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:56.660
who warned him (Hugh) to call him

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.160
in case anything weird happened this night

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.760
and then suddenly

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:03.760
there's a blackout

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.060
The guests light candles until Mike comes
to the rescue with 3 boxes of glowsticks:

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.720
red, blue, and green,

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.560
and decides to give everyone a blue
glow stick for themselves

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.260
and after Mike goes outside

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:19.440
He comes back, telling everyone that the entire
neighborhood is blacked out except for 1 house.

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.040
Which is 'all lit up'

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.220
But there’s something else: it’s dark.

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.820
Darker than it’s ever been on most nights.

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.080
So the group with their glowsticks all go
out

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.040
very carefully where outside they see

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.970
the comet fly across the sky.

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.340
They go back inside and notice
one of the glasses is chipped;

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.020
See, what I told you? The radiation can do more than crack phones

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:42.160
Did you guys notice that Amir had no knowledge as to who Beth’s sister was?

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.870
and that Mike and Laurie were confused about each
other?

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.540
These are important clues to who exactly they are

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.280
and what exactly is going on

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.080
because Amir and Laurie, have
been affected by something.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.000
as to what this is, well, we'll find out later

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.160
Inside, they talk about the blackout and the
house with the lights on, until Hugh announces

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.850
that he wants to go to the other house to
use their phone to contact his brother.

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:04.780
So, Amir goes with Hugh to keep him safe, to the other house.

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.220
As the rest of the group waits, suddenly they
hear banging on the side door.

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.420
Kevin peeks outside but he can’t see anyone
out there.

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.880
and then Mike manages to get the electricity back on
with the generator.

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:17.310
and that's when Hugh and Amir come back.

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.420
Hugh is bleeding from his head and gets his head patched up with a bandaid

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:22.900
as Amir talks about the box that he brought back

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.440
What’s with the box? Well...

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:29.220
Amir took it after he saw Hugh drop it and
run around a corner after seeing something

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.240
But Hugh has no idea what Amir is talking
about

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.520
and is adamant that it has nothing to do with what he saw.

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.620
and then everyone's like "Wait, then what did you see then?"

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.720
and he refuses to talk about it

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:44.040
At first they think to put the box back but
Mike decides to open it and inside the box

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.980
is a ping-pong paddle and photos of everyone
at the party.

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:50.290
On the back of each photo is a number.

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:53.960
Confused, the group demands Hugh to tell them
what he saw

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.020
and he reluctantly tells them that he peeked

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:59.600
into the other house and saw a table set for
8 people:

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:03.780
implying, that he saw duplicates of themselves.

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:07.640
Then Hugh decides to go out to the other house
and writes down a note, asking to borrow their

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:09.820
phone, but then Laurie spots someone at the
door.

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:14.370
It’s a tall guy and as Hugh is finished
writing his note, Kevin opens the door and

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.080
finds a note taped to it.

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.580
He reads it aloud for everyone to hear “Hey
there!

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:19.900
Don’t mean to freak you out.

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.620
But we just wanted to borrow your phone for
five minutes tops.

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:23.800
Thanks.”

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.400
It's the same note that Hugh just finished writing.

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.300
Do you know what this means?

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.580
This means that there's another version of the group

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.490
out there in the their own version of the house

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:34.340
Doing the exact same thing.

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:36.640
They (Other Group) delivered the note first, which means that

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.260
They're a bit ahead of the first group

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.580
presumably another version of Hugh delivered the note.

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.800
With that being said, it gets even more complicated from here on out

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:47.780
That’s when Mike decides to go over there
to meet their ‘hypothetical duplicates’

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:53.680
and the group splits up with Hugh, Amir, Beth,
and Lee staying behind in the house

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.520
Outside its eerie, no one’s walking around,

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.180
it’s pitch black

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:58.620
and as they walk the empty neighborhood.

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:00.960
Laurie, Kevin, Emily, and MIke

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:03.955
see a quartet of people with red glowsticks

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:06.260
who are exactly identical to them.

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:08.860
The group return back to the house, running to the house

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:12.700
and tell the rest of the group about their other selves with the red glow sticks

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:16.700
Emily also mentions that there’s an area
where it’s darker than the rest of neighborhood.

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:20.900
She calls it ‘The Dark Zone’ and it’s
something that Hugh and Amir had noticed and

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:22.100
walked through, earlier.

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:23.800
They need answers. Now.

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:28.320
And Emily asks if there’s any books that might help them out and surprisingly Beth has one!

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.500
A book that belongs to Hugh’s brother but 
its in their car.

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:33.100
So Hugh and Kevin go get it.

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:35.880
and it’s a scientific book about quantum physics and quantum theory

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:38.290
and the many worlds interpretation theory

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:40.920
So the Darkzone is important to the story.

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:43.560
because it was created by the comet and the radiation.

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:47.300
and we later find out that It bridges multiple realities together

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:50.120
and when you walk through it, you end up another reality.

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:53.040
Which means: that everytime you enter and exit the house

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:55.360
you risk coming back to the wrong version of it

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.860
Which would explain Amir and Laurie's weird behavior

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:01.980
They came to the dinner late and they probably walked through the Darkzone

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:04.060
which is why they remember things differently

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:06.480
they are from a different version of the house

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:10.440
So after the group reads the book and discuss its contents. This is what they conclude:

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:13.920
That there are an infinite number of realities with their own versions of the group

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:17.020
and the houses with an infinite number of differences

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:20.620
which is why one group has blue glowsticks while the other has red glowsticks

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:23.100
With that being said, as soon as the comet passes

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:26.300
each reality is stuck, permanently, with whoever stays in there

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:29.139
there's no going back home because it's locked off

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:30.500
From every other reality

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:33.800
From here on things get complicated and difficult to track

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:36.500
but let's see if you guys can keep track with me and the characters in the movie

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:38.760
So Mike told the group that he saw Amir, Hugh and Lee

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:43.400
from the window when he was outside, creeping on and peeking on into the other house

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:48.080
In this house, Lee is napping so the group
thinks that maybe the Beth in the other house

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:49.400
is currently sleeping

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:52.380
which means: this other house doesn't have the book

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:56.320
since they didn't have the conversation with Beth since Beth in the other house was asleep

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:58.960
and then Mike has a private talk with Kevin and tells
him (Kevin)

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:00.920
that he (Mike) is going to blackmail his other self

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:04.500
from stopping the other group from getting the book that's in the car

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:06.860
and Mike leaves in spite of Kevin trying to stop
him.

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:11.400
Now Hugh and Amir in this house now,
realise that they are in the wrong house

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:12.980
Since they have red glowsticks

00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:16.190
and they see that in this house the blue glow stick box is opened,

00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:18.920
and leave after stealing the box and the book.

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:22.700
Emily overhears Beth asks Lee where she
bought this plant.

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:24.440
"Oh, got it from Galaxy, that thrift store"

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:27.440
The same way it happened earlier near the beginning of the film.

00:08:27.449 --> 00:08:31.770
and now Emily realizes that when she
left outside with Kevin, Mike, and Laurie,

00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:34.729
they most have already come back to a different
house.

00:08:34.729 --> 00:08:38.589
So someone from another version of the house breaks one of the car windows, and the group

00:08:38.589 --> 00:08:40.959
checks their cars to see if anything was stolen.

00:08:40.959 --> 00:08:45.319
Emily wanders off to her car and puts on a
ring that Kevin once gave to her.

00:08:45.319 --> 00:08:47.399
Only to run into another version of Kevin
near her car

00:08:47.399 --> 00:08:50.020
because when Emily asks Kevin about Hugh's car

00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:52.460
this Kevin has no idea what she's talking about

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:56.279
and after they realize this, they both slowly walk away from each other

00:08:56.279 --> 00:08:59.080
Once group is back inside, they hear someone at the doorstep

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:01.420
and it's Hugh and Amir who came back from the other house

00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:07.040
and they start telling the group, their story, which is basically the same story that was told earlier

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:09.420
by the red glowstick version of Hugh and Amir

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:11.240
and Lee points out that this version of Hugh

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:14.820
is wearing a different bandaid from the one that she gave the other Hugh

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:16.491
So our group makes their own version of the box

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:17.820
Why? As a marker

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:21.260
It's full of objects and information that's unique and relevant to them

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:25.640
So if they ever get lost, they can check the box and see if they are at the right house

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:29.320
So with all this said, this probably means that some houses do have boxes already

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:31.550
while some definitely don't

00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:32.809
Then there's a knock at the door and a note appears

00:09:32.809 --> 00:09:34.180
It’s Mike’s blackmail note.

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:38.540
The note reads “Beth + book = Trinidad club
don't let it happen buddy”

00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:40.960
basically Mike and Beth had an affair 12 years ago

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:43.300
and Mike in many if not all realities

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:46.760
must have thought that blackmailing himself was a good plan

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:49.260
and Hugh finds this note, and when he finds this out

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.200
he realizes what it means (the letter)

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:53.900
and gets super pissed and he punches Mike.

00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:57.020
Everything is falling apart in this house.
People are freaking out

00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:59.800
They're not sure if they belong.
Not sure of whose 'who

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:01.640
and everyone's losing their minds

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:04.700
and Emily is just fed up with all this chaos and confusion

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:06.960
and all this suffering

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:10.200
Emily, decides to leave the house, walking through the Dark Zone.

00:10:10.269 --> 00:10:13.929
Where she peeks into different versions of
the house, hoping to find her way home or

00:10:13.929 --> 00:10:17.339
at least somewhere better since in a lot of
the alternate realities

00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:18.600
People are fighting and arguing.

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:24.000
Until she finds one perfect home where the
group decided to chill inside and just enjoy themselves

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.820
and Emily sneaks into this house and takes their
tranquilizers before sneaking out

00:10:28.829 --> 00:10:31.760
Inside, this version of the group hear something
crack and walk outside

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:34.600
to find the windshield of Hugh’s car, shattered.

00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:36.508
This version of Emily checks her own vehicle

00:10:36.508 --> 00:10:37.980
putting on the ring that Kevin won for her

00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:41.060
only to have our Emily sneak up from behind

00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:42.600
and drug her with a ketamine soaked napkin.

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:47.740
and after drugging the second Emily, our Emily puts the second Emily in the trunk of the car

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:50.200
takes her jacket and leaves

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:52.960
taking her jacket and pretending to be this other Emily

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:55.000
when she goes back inside and although agitated,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.500
tries to fit in without anyone noticing AND Lee notices

00:10:58.639 --> 00:11:00.959
and wonders why Emily was taking so long.

00:11:00.959 --> 00:11:03.360
Emily explains that she was admiring the comet

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:06.200
and so the group go on the veranda to watch the comet pass by.

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:10.460
But inside, Emily hears a noise and turns
around to see her other self,

00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:12.040
crawling to the bathroom.

00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:14.920
and our Emily goes in and locks the door behind
her,

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:16.920
and smashes the drugged Emily's face

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:18.540
Hiding the body in the shower tub,

00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:19.740
cleaning up the bloodstains,

00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:22.080
and after realizing she's lost her own ring

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:24.180
takes the other Emily’s ring.

00:11:24.199 --> 00:11:26.879
Never noticing her own original one on the floor.

00:11:26.879 --> 00:11:29.009
As soon as she leaves the bathroom, she faints.

00:11:29.009 --> 00:11:32.350
She wakes up the next morning on the couch
and everything seems normal.

00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:35.410
None of the craziness from last night seems
to have followed her.

00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:37.920
Emily even checks the bathroom only to find
Beth come out,

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:40.120
with no sign that the body was in the bathtub.

00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:44.189
Emily goes outside to find Hugh’s car windshield
cracked and the book about quantum physics

00:11:44.189 --> 00:11:46.620
still in his car and that's when Kevin sees her

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:50.999
and gives her back her ring. As she takes the ring back, Kevin gets a call.

00:11:50.999 --> 00:11:52.439
Its from Emily's phone

00:11:52.439 --> 00:11:54.970
He answers the phone call and listens.

00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:57.040
Staring with suspicion at our Emily.

00:11:57.380 --> 00:11:59.080
So you’re probably wondering what happened right?

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:02.739
Well, "Our Emily", who we
shall call “Emily-1”, drugged the second

00:12:02.739 --> 00:12:04.089
Emily, who we shall call Emily-2.

00:12:04.089 --> 00:12:08.860
and my theory is that sometime during the night, Emily 2 snuck out

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:11.220
and that's why there's no body in the bathtub:

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:12.660
She lived

00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:15.700
The next morning Emily-2 calls Kevin using her phone

00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:17.389
that in this reality, never broke,

00:12:17.389 --> 00:12:19.780
and Kevin, now listening to the phone call

00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:22.320
now knows that the Emily in front of him, is not 'his Emily''

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:25.240
and now he's sure that something happened between the two of them

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:30.080
So Emily-2 is lucky enough to stay in her home reality, where she was almost killed by Emily-1

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:33.740
But that’s what I think, tell me your theories in the comments down below

00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:36.840
and with that being said, thank you so much for watching, ladies &amp; gentlemen.

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:39.680
