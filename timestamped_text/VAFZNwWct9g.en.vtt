land on jake and nathiri takes this as a sign&nbsp;
to take him to her clan the o'matakaya he is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.360

heir to the chieftain ship and nati's fiancee&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.520
jake meets the clan's chief and priestess aja&nbsp;
khan and moak who also happen to be nati's parents&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.480
after much deliberation moat decides to take in&nbsp;
jake and have naytiri teach him their ways of life&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.160
jake settles in for the night with the clan and he&nbsp;
is instantly brought back to the avatar stimulator&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.880
he reports everything he's learned to grace as&nbsp;
well as to colonel quaridge the colonel gives jake&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.920
three months to convince the navy to move or else&nbsp;
they will be bombing their home tree grace grows&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.720
suspicious of jake's dealings with the colonel so&nbsp;
she transfers the team to a remote outpost at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:56.240
floating mountains of pandora over the next three&nbsp;
months natieri teaches jake the ways of the navi&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.120
she tells jake that once he is ready he will&nbsp;
have to choose his own icon a winged beast the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:06.400
navi's used to hunt and he will finally become a&nbsp;
warrior jake learns to track and hunt the wildlife&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.560
and also begins to understand the spiritual&nbsp;
connection between all the beings in pandora&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:16.080
soon enough jake grows sympathetic with the&nbsp;
na'vi and starts falling in love with natieri&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:21.920
once he gets his first clean kill he nati sutay&nbsp;
and other navies go to the floating mountains&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.640
to get their own icons they reach the icron's&nbsp;
nest and [ __ ] orders jake to choose first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.320
in order to choose one the icon must choose&nbsp;
him first by trying to kill him he manages to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.680
take down one of the beasts and bonds with&nbsp;
it through the nerve endings on his hair&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:41.360
naitiri pushes them off the cliff forcing&nbsp;
jake to fly with his icon to solidify the bond&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:46.480
as they're flying their icons jake and nati face&nbsp;
an almost ill-fated encounter with the toruk&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.600
a mighty dragon-like beast that the navi's fear&nbsp;
and worship only five nabis in history have been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:57.280
able to tame and ride the toruk including nati's&nbsp;
great-grandfather the three months come to an end&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.160
and the team goes back to the facility colonel&nbsp;
quarage gives jake the ultimatum but he asks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.960
the colonel for an extension just until his final&nbsp;
ceremony is over and then he becomes one of them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:12.080
and he can convince them to relocate the day of&nbsp;
the ceremony arrives and jake is finally accepted&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:18.160
into the omadikaya clan now that he is one of them&nbsp;
natieri takes jake into the tree of souls the tree&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:23.200
of souls is one of the navi's most sacred places&nbsp;
where the memories of their ancestors are stored&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.920
they can access these memories by tying their&nbsp;
nerve endings to the fibers of the tree it is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:33.120
also one of the places with the most unobtainium&nbsp;
deposits nadiri tells jake that he can now choose&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:39.600
a wife he then proposes to naitiri who happily&nbsp;
accepts under the tree of souls the two kiss and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.920
connect their nerve endings binding themselves to&nbsp;
each other for the rest of their lives in the eyes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:49.840
of their goddess iowa as morning breaks naitiri&nbsp;
is awakened by the sounds of a large machine&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:55.600
a bulldozer has come from the rda tearing up the&nbsp;
tree of souls naitiri tries to wake jake but he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:00.880
is currently out of the stimulation and remains&nbsp;
unconscious by the time jake wakes up he sees a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:06.800
frantic nati dragging him away he signals the&nbsp;
bulldozer to stop but it continues on plowing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.600
he then climbs the machine and starts destroying&nbsp;
the cameras but the crew starts shooting at him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:15.680
they run away with nati sobbing as she watches&nbsp;
the machines tore down their sacred place&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:21.920
meanwhile the rda catches the footage of jake&nbsp;
destroying the cameras and is able to identify him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:26.720
jake and nati make it back to the home tree where&nbsp;
he tries to persuade etu khan to relocate for the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:32.880
safety of the clan soute attacks jake accusing him&nbsp;
of mating with his betrothed nade tiri admits to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:38.480
this and says it cannot be undone as they are now&nbsp;
bonded before iowa at their outpost norm tries to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:43.600
stop the soldiers as they pull jake and grace from&nbsp;
the simulators but it's too late jakes takes the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:47.840
opportunity to state his final plea but he&nbsp;
and grace faint before he can say anything&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:52.320
they are brought back to the facility and jake's&nbsp;
true allegiance is revealed through a video log&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:57.120
stating that the nabbies will never give up their&nbsp;
home colonel kwaraj decides to pull the plug and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:02.000
bomb the navies away from the home tree grace then&nbsp;
tells the company that they can't destroy the home&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.040
tree because it will destroy the biological neural&nbsp;
network native to pandora the synapses connecting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:12.400
all of them together like one enormous brain the&nbsp;
rda isn't fully convinced but agrees to give the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:17.280
team one hour to convince the omadikaya to move&nbsp;
grace and jake regain consciousness in their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:22.320
avatar forms and jake starts telling them about&nbsp;
the rda's plans he then admits that he was sent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:28.240
there as a spy but now things have changed hurt&nbsp;
by his betrayal nati lashes out at him and leaves&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:33.840
jake and grace are then taken captive the rda&nbsp;
sends hovercrafts to the home tree and starts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:39.440
gassing them out refusing to run the umatikaya&nbsp;
fights back but their arrows are useless against&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:44.000
the heavy steel of the crafts the hovercrafts&nbsp;
then fire the missiles at the natives and at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.880
the home tree the tree immediately lights up on&nbsp;
fire as the navies make a run for their lives&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:55.040
jack and grace are tied to their post unable to&nbsp;
escape until mode approaches them she sets them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:59.360
free telling them that if they are indeed one&nbsp;
of them then they should help them the firing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:04.160
continues at the home trees roots causing the&nbsp;
trunk to finally break the home tree topples&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:09.200
over and kills a hundred navies by crushing them&nbsp;
on the ground natieri searches for survivors and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:14.400
finds her father with a shard to his chest with&nbsp;
his dying breath he bestows upon her his bow and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:19.600
arrows and makes her promise to fulfill her duties&nbsp;
jakes finds her in the rubble but natieri pushes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:24.640
him away telling him to never come back back&nbsp;
at the facility jake and grace are taken out of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:30.080
the simulation once again and are arrested while&nbsp;
jake's avatar body collapses among the debris as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:35.600
the avatar team lay in their cell trudy busts them&nbsp;
out they hijack one of the helicopters and escape&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:40.960
unluckily grace takes a hit to the stomach jake&nbsp;
patches her up as they make it back to their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:45.920
original outpost they relocated higher up the&nbsp;
mountains where the rda can't get to it easily&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:52.080
jake gets back into simulation and formulates a&nbsp;
plan once he's back in his avatar form he calls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:56.960
out his icon jake knows that there's only&nbsp;
one way the omanikaya will listen to him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:02.960
together they hunt down the toruk with nowhere&nbsp;
else left to go the omanikaya are forced to take&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:07.760
refuge at the last remaining tree of souls as&nbsp;
they wait for an answer to their prayers they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:13.040
hear a strong gust of wind behind them and gasp&nbsp;
in horror as they see the toru flying towards them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:17.440
it lands on the ground and nateria's shocked to&nbsp;
see that jake has managed to tame the mighty beast&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.200
this feat gains the awe and respect of the navies&nbsp;
jake asks soute to join him in the fight against&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:28.160
the humans and he agrees jake then brings&nbsp;
grace to the navi asking them to save her life&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:32.480
he takes her human body to the tree&nbsp;
of souls together with her avatar body&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:36.880
and the clan performs a ritual to try and transfer&nbsp;
grace's consciousness into her avatar form&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:42.320
but it was too late grace's wound was too&nbsp;
deep and she died before the ritual was over&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:48.240
but jake knows that the battle is far from over&nbsp;
together with sute they rally up the omadakaya&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:54.560
they then travel to neighboring clans gathering&nbsp;
navis from the plains seas and mountains to join&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:59.200
them in the battle for their homes by the end&nbsp;
of the day they managed to gather over 2 000&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:05.200
navis at the tree of souls through intel jake&nbsp;
learns the rda's plans to bomb the tree of souls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:09.120
he then forms a plan to lure them through the&nbsp;
floating mountains and then attack them there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:14.400
even before they reach the sacred place jake&nbsp;
prays to iowa at the tree of souls for guidance&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:20.160
as morning breaks the rda launches the hovercrafts&nbsp;
along with the bombs the navy clans wait for them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:25.360
among the floating mountains not long after the&nbsp;
clans from the plains take action in charge of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:30.720
the machine suit surveying the grounds the navies&nbsp;
take the first fire flying around the hovercrafts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:34.880
and shooting them down with their arrows&nbsp;
they managed to take down a few helicopters&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:39.440
but the company's armory is too strong they&nbsp;
launch fires at the navies with their guns&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:44.640
taking down quite a number of them colonel quarage&nbsp;
spots jake on the toruk and starts firing at him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:50.000
jake escapes the line of fire luring the&nbsp;
colonel's hovercraft deeper into the mountains&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.840
suddenly trudy and her helicopter intervenes she&nbsp;
shoots fire at the kernel allowing jake to escape&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:01.360
meanwhile nate terry's icon is taken down and she&nbsp;
lands on the ground witnessing the devastation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:06.160
that the humans have caused suite launches&nbsp;
a heroic act at the main hovercraft taking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:11.120
away a number of men unloading the bombs before&nbsp;
he is gunned down and falls back to the ground&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:16.480
the navies are overwhelmed as they retreat deeper&nbsp;
into the forest suddenly the hovercrafts pick up a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:21.920
different movement in a matter of seconds various&nbsp;
pandorian wildlife come charging at the machines&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:27.440
as the icon overtakes the skies taking down the&nbsp;
remaining crafts nati interprets this as a sign&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:32.000
of help from iowa jake then lands on the main&nbsp;
hovercraft carrying the bombs and takes down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.720
their machine guns he runs around the craft&nbsp;
expertly avoiding fire and launches a grenade&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:41.680
at one of the engines the craft goes down&nbsp;
and blows up among the mountains he launches&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:46.800
several more grenades at the colonel's craft but&nbsp;
quarach manages to escape using a mechanical suit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:50.800
the grenades blow up and jake is tossed back&nbsp;
into the sky and lands back to the ground&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:56.320
the colonel survives the blow and starts hunting&nbsp;
down the outpost courage reaches the location of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:56.320 --> 00:11:01.120
the simulators just in time as nati makes&nbsp;
a launch at him quarage takes her down and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:05.920
traps her beneath the trunks of a tree as he's&nbsp;
about to stab her jake appears and fights him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:11.120
jake is able to hold him off breaking his&nbsp;
knife and the protective glass around the suit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:16.080
the colonel gasps for air and then starts&nbsp;
targeting jake's real body instead he breaks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:20.800
open the glass of the outpost and destroys the&nbsp;
simulators jake stabs him on the neck as the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:26.400
colonel drags his body natieri frees herself and&nbsp;
launches an arrow straight to the colonel's heart&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:31.840
she launches another arrow to finish the kill&nbsp;
meanwhile jake emerges from the simulator dragging&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:36.560
his body to reach for the air mask the poisonous&nbsp;
air knocks him out and he's unable to breathe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:42.160
nateri realizes what's happening and she climbs&nbsp;
inside the outpost and puts the air mask on jake&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:47.440
she sees his real body for the first time and&nbsp;
they hold each other close back in his avatar&nbsp;&nbsp;
