00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.720
Welcome back for another 5 minute movie recap.

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:05.760
Today, I'm going to give&nbsp;
you an overview of the 1994&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.680
English-language French action-thriller&nbsp;
film called 'Léon: The Professional'.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.360
There will be Spoilers ahead,&nbsp;
so please proceed with caution.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.360
Léon is an Italian-American hitman who&nbsp;
lives a solitary life in the outskirts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.520
of New York City's Little Italy, where he&nbsp;
works for a mafia boss known as 'Old Tony.'

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.160
Léon encounters a lonely 12-year-old&nbsp;
girl named Mathilda Lando one day.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.640
Mathilda now lives in an apartment down the&nbsp;
hall with her dysfunctional family and no&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.360
longer attends her problematic girls' school.&nbsp;
The DEA officers who have been paying Mathilda's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:41.120
violent father to conceal cocaine in his apartment&nbsp;
are furious. DEA officers assault the premises,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.960
headed by finely dressed drug addict&nbsp;
Norman Stansfield, after discovering he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.000
has been stealing the cocaine. Stansfield murders&nbsp;
Mathilda's whole family when she is out shopping&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.640
for groceries during the raid. When Mathilda&nbsp;
arrives, she learns what has occurred only in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.120
time to proceed down the hall to Léon's apartment,&nbsp;
where he reluctantly provides her with refuge.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.480
Léon is a hitman, Mathilda swiftly finds.&nbsp;
She begs him to look after her and teach&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.360
her his talents so she may revenge&nbsp;
her four-year-old brother's murder.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.320
Léon is first disturbed by her presence and&nbsp;
contemplates murdering her, but he ultimately&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.160
teaches Mathilda and demonstrates how to&nbsp;
wield various weapons to her satisfaction.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.240
She does his errands, cleans his flat,&nbsp;
and teaches him to read in exchange.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.840
The duo develops a strong relationship over&nbsp;
time. Mathilda admires Léon and develops a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.320
crush on him immediately, telling him she loves&nbsp;
him frequently, but he refuses to reciprocate.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.560
Mathilda prepares a bag with firearms&nbsp;
from Léon's collection and goes out to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.680
assassinate Stansfield after Léon&nbsp;
leaves for an alleged mission.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.640
She bluffs her way into the DEA building by&nbsp;
acting as a delivery girl, only to be ambushed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.840
in a restroom by Stansfield; one of his men enters&nbsp;
and reveals that Léon had just killed Malky, one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.520
of the corrupt DEA officers, in Chinatown earlier&nbsp;
that morning. Léon rescues Mathilda after finding&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.600
her plot in a message left for him, killing&nbsp;
two more of Stansfield's men in the process.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.480
Tony is aggressively probed about&nbsp;
Léon's location by an irate Stansfield.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.680
Léon tells Mathilda about how&nbsp;
he became a cleaner that night;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:11.280
when he was 18, Léon fell in love with a girl from&nbsp;
a rich family in Italy. They planned to elope,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.920
but when the girl's father found out about&nbsp;
their connection, he killed her. In retaliation,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.400
Léon murdered his father and fled to New York,&nbsp;
where he met Tony and apprenticed as a cleaner.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.960
Later, an NYPD ESU squad dispatched by Stansfield&nbsp;
catches Mathilda as she returns home from grocery&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:31.800
shopping and attempts to penetrate Léon's&nbsp;
apartment. Léon catches the ESU squad off&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:37.680
guard and saves Mathilda. By breaking a hole in an&nbsp;
air shaft, Léon allows Mathilda to flee quickly;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.120
he tells her to meet him at Tony's in an&nbsp;
hour, and tells her that he loves her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.320
only minutes before the police blow up the flat.&nbsp;
In the ensuing confusion, Léon slips out of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:51.840
building, posing as a wounded ESU officer; he&nbsp;
escapes unnoticed except by Stansfield, who chases&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:57.040
him down and shoots him in the back. Léon dies&nbsp;
after placing an item in Stansfield's hands that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:02.880
he claims is 'from Mathilda.' It's a grenade pin,&nbsp;
Stansfield learns. When he unlocks Léon's vest,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.440
he discovers a cluster of live explosives,&nbsp;
which detonate instantly, killing Stansfield.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.200
Mathilda follows Léon's&nbsp;
instructions and visits Tony.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.360
Mathilda tries to persuade Tony to&nbsp;
hire her, but Tony bluntly refuses,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.360
telling Mathilda that he had been told by Léon to&nbsp;
give her his money if anything happened to him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.320
He sends Mathilda back to school with&nbsp;
a $100 stipend from Leon's finances,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:29.040
and the headmistress re-admits her when Mathilda&nbsp;
recounts what happened to her. She then proceeds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.200
to a nearby field to plant Léon's houseplant,&nbsp;
as she had advised him to 'give it roots.'
