00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:06.480
Hi, Mystery Recapped here. Today I’m&nbsp;
going to explain an American drama film&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:13.040
called “Flight”, which is loosely inspired by&nbsp;
the plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.920
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care! 
&nbsp;

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:26.400
The movie starts in a hotel room where pilot&nbsp;
Whip Whitaker wakes up with one of his flight&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.920
attendants, Katerina Marquez. The condition of&nbsp;
the room tells us that they had had a wild night&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.680
of alcohol, cigarettes, and intercourse. Whip’s&nbsp;
ex-wife calls him to talk about their son,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.880
but Whip dismisses her, saying that they can&nbsp;
talk later. Katerina gets ready and leaves for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:48.400
the airport for their next flight while Whip&nbsp;
is still hungover. He snorts a line of cocaine&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.960
to wake himself up and gets ready.
Whip then gets to the airport and into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:58.240
the flight. He is welcomed by Katerina and&nbsp;
another flight attendant named Margaret Thomason.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.400
He meets his co-pilot Ken Evans.&nbsp;
As the two prepare for the flight,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.240
Whip asks Margaret for an aspirin,&nbsp;
claiming he hasn’t slept in two days. 
&nbsp;

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.400
Somewhere else, a drug addict prostitute named&nbsp;
Nicole comes out of a hotel room after a night&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:17.280
with her client. She goes directly to her&nbsp;
dealer’s place and asks him for drugs. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:23.200
offers her to be in an adult movie for money, but&nbsp;
she declines. She buys a small quantity of heroin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.440
from him. The dealer warns her to be careful&nbsp;
with the drug because it hasn’t been cut. 
&nbsp;

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.360
Back in the flight, Whip, and Ken take off&nbsp;
despite the bad weather. They ascend a little&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.320
aggressively. Ken seems to notice Whip’s&nbsp;
weird behaviour, but doesn’t say anything.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:44.240
Whip asks to fly the plane himself, instead of&nbsp;
keeping it on autopilot. The turbulence gets worse&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:50.480
as they reach a higher altitude. Whip then levels&nbsp;
off the original route to avoid an area of smooth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:56.720
air. He pushes the plane higher and faster in an&nbsp;
attempt to make it reach a higher altitude. Ken is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.760
nervous about the decision, but Whip assures him&nbsp;
that he knows what he is doing. Ken reports the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.560
flight control that they are diverting from their&nbsp;
original path because of the weather. Whip takes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:12.080
the plane to a safer level and stabilises it.&nbsp;
The turbulence finally stops, and the passengers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.440
applaud in appreciation of the pilots. 
Meanwhile, Nicole reaches her home and sees&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.080
her perverted landlord inside. He is&nbsp;
there to ask her for the due rent.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.840
She forcefully sends him outside to wait until she&nbsp;
showers. But instead, she brings out the drug and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.880
injects herself with it. As she feels its effects,&nbsp;
the landlord yells at her to open the door. 
&nbsp;

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.560
At the same time, Whip comes out of the cockpit&nbsp;
to apologise to the passenger for the aggressive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.840
take-off. While announcing, he pours three&nbsp;
mini-vodka bottles into an orange juice&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.440
and drinks it. Sometime later, Margaret walks&nbsp;
into the cockpit to see the plane on autopilot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:55.600
and Whip sleeping peacefully. The mission control&nbsp;
informs Ken that the plane is ready to descend. As&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.800
he presses a few keys, aggressive turbulence&nbsp;
pushes the plane forward, waking Whip up.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:06.000
The passengers start to panic. Margaret asks&nbsp;
everyone to fasten their seatbelts quickly.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.040
Ken and Whip try to control the plane, but the&nbsp;
steering mechanisms don’t seem to work. Now, they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.320
are going on a straight dive without control. They&nbsp;
inform the mission control about the hydraulics&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:22.560
not working, but receive no useful feedback.&nbsp;
Whip stays calm and asks Ken to ditch the plane’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.920
fuel. He also tries several different emergency&nbsp;
maneuvers to bring the plane back under control&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:33.440
but is unsuccessful. Whip calls Margarete into&nbsp;
the cockpit to help him pull down a lever. 
&nbsp;

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:39.120
She straps herself in place and helps the pilot,&nbsp;
but the plane doesn’t stabilise. A forceful jerk&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.840
makes one of the stewardesses hit her head and&nbsp;
falls unconscious. As the plane is about to hit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:49.360
the land, Whip thinks of an idea. He asks Ken to&nbsp;
retract the flaps and the gears because they are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:55.040
going to roll down. Then, he asks Margate to say&nbsp;
I love you to her son, because the black box is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:00.240
recording. He knows that saving the plane is not&nbsp;
possible now. Whip gets a little control of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:06.240
steering and rolls the plane upside down to make&nbsp;
it go at a lower speed and buy them some time to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:12.240
find a safer landing spot. The stewardess who fell&nbsp;
earlier rolls around and falls to the ceiling.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:17.760
The passengers are in a panic when one little&nbsp;
boy mistakenly unstraps himself. Katerina goes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.720
to help him and fastens his seat belts. 
Below, Nicole’s landlord and a paramedic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.840
rescue her as she has overdosed. They, too, see&nbsp;
the upside-down plane flying in the sky. 
&nbsp;

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:32.560
Back in the plane, Whip keeps himself&nbsp;
composed, but Ken starts to panic.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:38.560
Both of the engines fail at the same time. Whip&nbsp;
turns the airplane over again, ready to crash&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:45.680
land. They slowly descend to a field, and one wing&nbsp;
hits a church’s tower, shearing it off. The plane&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:51.600
then slams onto the field. Whip’s head bangs&nbsp;
against the steering yoke, and he knocks out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:57.360
We see Katerina’s body lying limp on the ground as&nbsp;
Margaret cries in the background. The paramedics&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:02.720
arrive and rescue the passengers and the crew&nbsp;
members. The plane is broken in half. 
&nbsp;

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:08.320
Whip wakes up on a hospital bed and sees his&nbsp;
friend and a pilots union representative,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:13.520
Charlie Anderson, in his room. Charlie&nbsp;
praises him for saving a lot of lives.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:19.040
As it turns out, only six out of the one hundred&nbsp;
two people on the plane died, including Katerina,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:24.960
another stewardess, and four passengers. His&nbsp;
co-pilot is in a coma. Whip has incredibly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.840
managed to save a lot of people considering the&nbsp;
situation they were in. The people from National&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:36.080
Transportation Safety Board NTSB come to interview&nbsp;
him and leave after asking some questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:41.440
Shortly after, Whip’s friend, Harling, brings&nbsp;
Whip some cigarettes and alcohol, but Whip refuses&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:46.320
to drink. Harling informs him that his home is&nbsp;
surrounded by the media, who are dying to take&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:52.240
his interview. His heroic deed is being praised by&nbsp;
everyone. Whip asks Harling to bring his clothes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.320
and belongings to the hospital, because he&nbsp;
is getting discharged the following day.
&nbsp;

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:01.360
Later, Whip goes to the hospital’s&nbsp;
staircase to smoke and comes across Nicole,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:05.840
the prostitute who had previously overdosed.&nbsp;
A talkative cancer patient joins the two.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:10.240
The three smoke while talking about several&nbsp;
things. The patient believes that there's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:15.280
no way to stop things from happening. Like him&nbsp;
getting cancer and Whip landing the plane, the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:21.040
three of them meeting there was also inevitable.&nbsp;
After he leaves, Whip asks for Nicole’s address&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:25.440
and promises to visit one day. 
After being discharged, Harling takes Whip&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:30.480
to his family home on a farm because his home is&nbsp;
surrounded by the reporters. When he gets to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:35.840
farmhouse, he pours all the alcohol in the house&nbsp;
down the drain. He has made his decision to get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:42.160
sober. Later, Whip gets a call from Charlie, who&nbsp;
invites him to meet a lawyer named Hugh Lang. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:47.200
goes to meet them and gets to know that the NTSB&nbsp;
has found out about him being intoxicated before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:52.000
the flight. Since someone has to compensate for&nbsp;
the deaths of the passengers, they are likely to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.120
blame Whip for being intoxicated, which can result&nbsp;
in life imprisonment. Whip doesn’t take this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:03.200
information well and goes to the bar and starts to&nbsp;
drink again. He buys a bulk of alcohol on his way&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:08.400
back and stops by Nicole’s place. Her landlord&nbsp;
is forcefully trying to get money from her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:13.280
Whip gets there just in time to get him off her.&nbsp;
He offers the man some money and brings Nicole&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:18.960
to his farmhouse after realising she has nowhere&nbsp;
to go. That night, the two end up having sex. 
&nbsp;

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:24.960
Over the next few days, Whip continues to avoid&nbsp;
the press, but soon realizes that his reputation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:30.000
could be plagued by the others who were around&nbsp;
him. At Katerina's funeral, he meets Margaret,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.240
who claims she could tell that Whip was drunk&nbsp;
when she encountered him that morning. Whip&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:39.120
then starts to get personal, claiming that if not&nbsp;
for him, she could have ended up dead as well.
&nbsp;

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:43.600
Whip then visits Ken at the hospital.&nbsp;
Ken explains he hasn't told the NTSB,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:48.320
who have been investigating the crash, about&nbsp;
his suspicions on Whip's condition at the time.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:51.680
Ken knows what Margaret does, Whip was hung over&nbsp;
in the cockpit and that he may have been drunk&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:56.400
when the accident occurred. Even though he may&nbsp;
never walk again, Ken and his wife believe that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:01.680
his survival was a miracle. The couple is strictly&nbsp;
religious and insist that Whip pray with them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:04.720
which he does reluctantly.
Meanwhile, Nicole has been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:09.200
turning her life around, getting a job at a&nbsp;
grocery store and has been attending self-help&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:13.840
meetings to sober up from drug addiction. She&nbsp;
takes Whip with her to one of the meetings,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:19.200
but an uninterested Whip leaves mid-way. 
Shortly afterward, Nicole finds Whip working&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:24.640
on the Cessna in his father's garage. Whip tries&nbsp;
to persuade Nicole to fly to Jamaica with him. She&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:29.840
stops him and claims that he needs rehab, which&nbsp;
angers Whip. The two get into an argument, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:35.200
Nicole storms off into the house. The following&nbsp;
morning, Nicole leaves him a note and flees from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:41.200
the farmhouse with her luggage. Saddened by&nbsp;
her departure, Whip starts to drink even more.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:46.320
One day, he comes back to his farmhouse to see&nbsp;
reporters waiting for him. With nowhere else&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:52.080
to go, he rushes to his ex-wife’s house. 
However, since he is drunk, his family doesn’t&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:57.440
want him there. Whip gets into an argument with&nbsp;
his son and is kicked out of the house. Outside,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:02.880
the media surround him. He manages to get away&nbsp;
after giving vague answers to their questions. 
&nbsp;

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:07.760
Charlie is outraged by Whip’s alcoholism. They&nbsp;
are trying to prove that he wasn’t intoxicated&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:12.880
on the flight, but he is making it harder by&nbsp;
drinking every day. For the next eight days,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:18.400
Whip stays with Charlie. Hugh has managed to have&nbsp;
Whip's alcohol test thrown out on a technicality,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:23.440
but they still need to have Whip present his side&nbsp;
of the story to Ellen Block, the investigator for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:28.960
the NTSB. The evening before the hearing, Whip&nbsp;
is brought to his hotel room. Nervousness gets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:33.600
the best of him that night. He cannot sleep or&nbsp;
go through the documents that Hugh had prepared&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:39.040
for him. When he looks at the room’s mini-fridge,&nbsp;
he finds all kinds of alcohol have been removed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:44.640
However, he discovers a door that leads him to&nbsp;
the other room. The mini-fridge inside that room&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:50.160
is fully stocked with alcohol. Whip tries&nbsp;
to control himself but is unsuccessful. 
&nbsp;

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:54.400
The following day is the day of the&nbsp;
hearing. Charlie and Hugh knock on his door.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:59.520
When Whip doesn’t open it, they walk inside using&nbsp;
an extra set of keys. They are shocked to find the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:05.040
room trashed and bottles of alcohol scattered&nbsp;
everywhere. Whip is in the bathroom, completely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:10.400
drunk and out of his mind. He asks Charlie&nbsp;
to call Harling and bring him some cocaine.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:14.560
Charlie and Hugh have no other way to get&nbsp;
Whip back to his senses before the hearing,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:20.640
so they agree. Harling comes to the hotel room&nbsp;
and snorts cocaine along with Whip. Whip then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:26.240
gets ready and leaves the hotel confidently. 
At the hearing, Block doesn’t suspect Whip at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:30.960
all. She instead claims that the cause of the&nbsp;
plane dysfunctioning was a damaged jackscrew&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:35.840
in the tail of the plane that was supposed to be&nbsp;
repaired a few years ago. The jackscrew forced the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:41.840
tail stabiliser to turn around, which caused the&nbsp;
plane to dive. However, after saying that, Block&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:46.880
reveals that they have found two empty bottles&nbsp;
of vodka in the crash, which was only accessible&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:52.000
to the flight crew. She adds that Katerina, who&nbsp;
has a history of alcoholism, must have had the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:58.080
alcohol and asks Whip what he thinks. Whip goes&nbsp;
silent for a few seconds and finally admits that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:05.120
he drank the vodka, not Katerina. Everyone present&nbsp;
at the hearing gasps, and Charlie tries to object&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:10.320
but is dismissed. Whip finally confesses&nbsp;
that he was drunk and high while piloting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:16.000
the plane and is drunk right now too.  
In the following scene, we see Whip in prison&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.760
with his fellow prisoners. He tells them&nbsp;
that the hearing was his breaking point,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:25.040
and he couldn’t lie anymore. It has been thirteen&nbsp;
months since the hearing. He believes that he will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:30.800
be there for the next four years. While in prison,&nbsp;
he has sobered up and improved his relationship&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:37.200
with his wife and son. We see his son visit Whip&nbsp;
to know more about his father. He refers to Whip&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:42.800
as the most fascinating person he has ever seen&nbsp;
and takes his interview for his college essay.
