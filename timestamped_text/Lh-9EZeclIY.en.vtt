00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:07.440
Hi, Mystery Recapped here. Today I’m going to&nbsp;
explain a Zombie comedy film called “Fido,”&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:19.520
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care! 
In an alternate universe, a cloud of radiation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:25.280
coming from outer space has engulfed the earth.&nbsp;
The radiation caused the buried dead bodies to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:30.960
reanimate and attack humans as flesh-eating&nbsp;
zombies. Soon, the earth was swoon with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.400
such creatures who started killing everyone&nbsp;
that came in their way. Mankind retaliated,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:41.840
and a zombie war started. Humans had a hard&nbsp;
time winning the war until their savior&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:47.440
Dr. Reinhold Geiger established an organization&nbsp;
called the Zomcon. The doctor discovered that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.080
if the brain of a zombie was destroyed, the&nbsp;
zombie would die, never to reanimate again.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.280
Using this information, the soldiers fighting&nbsp;
the zombies aimed for their brains, and soon&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:05.120
the war was won. Zomcon built a security system&nbsp;
to save their town from further zombie attacks.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.360
They built a perimeter fence that enclosed&nbsp;
the town to not allow the zombies to enter.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.320
But even within the fence, when people die, they&nbsp;
would turn into zombies because of the radiation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.520
People’s lives were at great risk, but Dr.&nbsp;
Reinhold Geiger came through with a great&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.480
invention called the domestication collar. With&nbsp;
this collar, the zombie’s flesh cravings would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:30.320
die down, making them docile. A red light from the&nbsp;
collar suggests that the zombie’s desire for the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:36.320
flesh has been contained. People were suggested&nbsp;
to call Zomcon or push the nearest safety button&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.240
if the light from the collar goes out. 
When the zombies became docile,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.440
people started using them as maids and butlers&nbsp;
to help them with household work. Those who did&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.000
not wish to live like zombies and could afford&nbsp;
a funeral were buried deep inside the ground&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.040
after their heads were cut off from their bodies,&nbsp;
also known as the “reanimation free” burial. 
&nbsp;

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:00.000
In the town of Willard, children in school are&nbsp;
taught about Zomcon and the history of zombies.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.520
In one of such classes, the head of security at&nbsp;
Zomcon, Jonathan Bottoms, visits the students.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.440
Mr. Bottoms’s daughter, Cindy is also a student in&nbsp;
the class. Mr. Bottoms boasts about him making the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.800
town's safety against the zombies tighter, making&nbsp;
the students clap in appreciation. But a kid named&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:22.400
Timmy Robinson doesn’t seem impressed. He asks Mr.&nbsp;
Bottoms what would happen if the zombies who were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.960
buried come out someday. He thinks that they might&nbsp;
have been crawling their way up little by little.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.760
Mr. Bottoms is left speechless, and&nbsp;
the teacher soon ends the class. 
&nbsp;

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.760
The kids are also taught to use a rifle in&nbsp;
Willard, to prepare them for any kind of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.320
zombie attack. Two of Timmy’s friends&nbsp;
bully him and are sent for detention.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.960
When he comes back home, Tommy sees that the&nbsp;
Barrows family is moving into their neighborhood.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:50.080
Tommy’s mother Helen welcomes him home and&nbsp;
dismisses him, when he talks about his bullies.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:55.600
Later at night, his father Bill returns from work&nbsp;
and sees Helen has prepared a plethora of dishes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:01.120
for him. It turns out that she had bought a zombie&nbsp;
to help her around the house. Bill is not thrilled&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.520
about the new purchase ,because he is scared&nbsp;
of zombies. But Helen insists that their new&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:10.800
neighbors have six zombies, and they should have&nbsp;
at least one. Bill controls the creature through a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:16.640
remote and hurts him in the process. Little Timmy&nbsp;
pities the zombie and asks his father to stop. 
&nbsp;

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.040
The following day, Timmy waits for Bill to play&nbsp;
catch with him, but Bill makes an excuse and goes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:26.240
out to play golf with his friends. Timmy’s parents&nbsp;
are nonchalant about their duty towards their kid.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:32.080
His needs are often ignored in his home. He goes&nbsp;
outside to play alone, but Helen asks him to stop&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.800
because she doesn’t want the neighbors to think he&nbsp;
is lonely. Timmy then goes to the park and sees a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:41.600
zombie trying to fetch a can from the ground.&nbsp;
Someone is controlling the can from the bushes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.400
and troubling the zombie. Timmy goes to the bushes&nbsp;
and sees that his bullies are responsible for the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.280
prank. The bullies push him to the ground and&nbsp;
are about to shoot him when Timmy’s new zombie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.960
comes to his aid. He pushes the bullies away&nbsp;
and saves him. A happy Timmy thanks the zombie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:02.960
and names him Fido. Then, the two try to play&nbsp;
catch, but Fido doesn’t know how. So, instead,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:08.880
Timmy plays fetch with Fido, treating him like his&nbsp;
pet dog. As they play, the ball lands near Timmy’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:14.560
aggressive old neighbor, Mrs. Henderson. When&nbsp;
Fido goes to pick it up, the old woman attacks him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.920
and hits him repeatedly, making his collar&nbsp;
dysfunctional. Fido turns into a flesh-eating&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:25.840
zombie again and kills Mrs. Henderson. Just then,&nbsp;
Timmy arrives at the scene and is horrified to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:31.120
see him feeding on Mrs. Henderson. Fido makes&nbsp;
his way towards Timmy, but suddenly, his collar&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.920
starts working again. Timmy takes him back home,&nbsp;
but they forget to take the ball with them. 
&nbsp;

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:41.600
Fido and Timmy are now in Bill’s garage, where&nbsp;
Timmy cleans him. He notices a surgery mark on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:46.240
Fido’s chest and figures that he died from&nbsp;
a heart attack. Helen walks in and asks them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:50.560
what they are doing. Fido tries to tell her&nbsp;
about Mrs. Henderson, but Helen doesn’t give&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:55.920
him a chance to talk. At breakfast the next day,&nbsp;
Timmy mentions that Fido died from a heart attack&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:02.400
like Bill’s father, which upsets Bill. He had to&nbsp;
kill his own father during the zombie war. Then,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:08.080
Mr. Bottoms come over at Timmy’s to socialize and&nbsp;
talk about Mrs. Henderson’s sudden disappearance.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:12.800
It turns out that the police have started looking&nbsp;
for her. Timmy listens to their conversation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:18.000
After the guests leave, he asks his parents about&nbsp;
Mrs. Henderson. Helen tells him that if a pet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.120
zombie has attacked Mrs. Henderson, his masters&nbsp;
would be thrown to the danger zone outside the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:28.960
town. At night, Mrs. Henderson turns into a zombie&nbsp;
and walks around the town. She attacks a man,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:33.280
turning him into a zombie as well. Timmy is&nbsp;
scared of being thrown into the danger zone,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:38.480
so he goes out looking for Mrs. Henderson’s dead&nbsp;
body to hide it. But he only finds her decapitated&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:44.080
arm. Suddenly, the zombie Mrs. Henderson attacks&nbsp;
Timmy, but he manages to hit her with a shovel.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:48.560
After hitting her repeatedly, he decapitates&nbsp;
her and then buries her in a public garden. 
&nbsp;

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:54.320
Fido is kept tied to a tree outside at night.&nbsp;
Timmy sees him struggling and making a lot of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:59.120
noise. When he goes to check on him, he finds that&nbsp;
the light in the collar is off, which means that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:04.720
it isn’t working. The noise wakes one of Timmy’s&nbsp;
neighbors named Theopolis. He offers to help Timmy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:10.880
with the zombie problem. The two bring Fido to Mr.&nbsp;
Theopolis’s house, where he fixes his collar. They&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:15.760
agree not to tell anyone of the incident because&nbsp;
a dysfunctioning collar should be reported to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:21.680
Zomcon. The next day, Helen gets Fido dressed&nbsp;
up in Bill’s suit to take him to a funeral. She&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:27.280
has started liking Fido. Bill is obsessed with&nbsp;
zombie funerals and attends one whenever he can.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:31.920
The four attend the funeral, where the zombie’s&nbsp;
body and head are put into two different coffins.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:36.320
Meanwhile, the zombie that Mrs. Henderson&nbsp;
had bitten attacks other people in the park.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:41.440
The town is now infested with zombies. The&nbsp;
Zomcon workers fight them and try to bring&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:46.240
the situation under control. The following&nbsp;
day, Helen sees Timmy playing with Fido and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:51.600
is happy to see he has finally found a friend.&nbsp;
She brings juice for both. Bill complains,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:55.440
saying that the zombie doesn’t need to&nbsp;
eat or drink, but Helen insists he can.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.800
She asks Bill to stay home and enjoy time with&nbsp;
family, but he drives away with his friend.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:05.840
While leaving, he turns around to see Fido,&nbsp;
Helen, and Timmy playing like a happy family.
&nbsp;

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:12.000
One day, Timmy’s bullies are caught by Mr. Bottoms&nbsp;
for accidentally shooting a Zomcon worker’s leg.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.720
Mr. Bottoms suspects that the kids shot Mrs.&nbsp;
Henderson and killed her, who in turn is creating&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:21.520
more zombies. But the kids push the blame upon&nbsp;
Timmy and Fido, saying that Fido attacked them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:26.880
at the park earlier. Then, we see Fido and Tommy&nbsp;
climbing up a hill while talking about how they’re&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:31.520
always going to be together. Suddenly, they are&nbsp;
attacked by the bullies again who tie them to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:36.480
a tree. Their plan is to destroy the collar and&nbsp;
then kill Fido so everyone would think they are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:41.920
the town's heroes. They break his collar but are&nbsp;
too scared to shoot him. But one of them gets shot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:48.800
instead. Fido frees himself and chases the bully&nbsp;
into a small cabin nearby. There, he eats him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:53.520
He then approaches Timmy but doesn’t attack him.&nbsp;
Fido has built an emotional connection with Timmy,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.080 --> 00:08:00.160
greater than his hunger for flesh. When he cannot&nbsp;
untie Timmy himself, Fido goes to search for help&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:05.760
and brings back Helen. A bully has turned into a&nbsp;
zombie and is about to attack Timmy but Fido and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:10.560
Helen reach just in time to stop him. Helen burns&nbsp;
the little cabin to get rid of the evidence. 
&nbsp;

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:16.400
Later, the Robinsons are at Mr. Bottoms’s home.&nbsp;
Helen talks to Bottom’s wife Dee Dee about her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:21.280
being pregnant. Mr. Bottoms has been noticing&nbsp;
Helen being friendly to Fido and warns Bill&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:26.960
about the situation. He suspects Fido to be Mrs.&nbsp;
Henderson’s killer. When they come back home,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:31.920
Bill tries talking to Helen but is dismissed.&nbsp;
Meanwhile, the Zomcon workers find Mrs.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:37.280
Henderson’s body and the ball Timmy had left at&nbsp;
the site. They trace the murder back to Fido and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:42.640
arrest him the following day. A saddened Timmy&nbsp;
chases the van Fido is in but is stopped by Mr.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:48.240
Bottoms. After a few days, Mr. Bottoms’s daughter&nbsp;
Cindy tells Timmy that Fido is still alive.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:52.800
She had heard Mr. Bottoms talking to someone&nbsp;
on the phone about not wasting a good zombie.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:58.320
Fido is being made to work in a Zomcon factory&nbsp;
as free labor. They ask for their neighbor,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:03.440
Mr. Theopolis’s help to get into the factory&nbsp;
and rescue Fido. Mr. Theopolis used to be a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:07.920
worker at Zomcon but was fired for being&nbsp;
in a romantic relationship with a zombie.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:12.480
He and Timmy go to the Zomcon headquarter&nbsp;
where people go to repair their old zombies.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:16.640
Mr. Theopolis breaks a zombie’s collar&nbsp;
and creates havoc in the establishment.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:20.640
Now, they just have to go to the factory&nbsp;
on the other side and bring Fido back. 
&nbsp;

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:26.240
Meanwhile, Helen and Bill find out about Timmy’s&nbsp;
plan and make their way to the Zomcon headquarter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:31.840
as well. Timmy manages to get inside the factory&nbsp;
while Mr. Theopolis fights the receptionist. But,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:37.520
Mr. Bottoms sees that Timmy has snuck in through&nbsp;
the surveillance camera. Mr. Bottoms finds Timmy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:42.560
and throws him to the other side of the fence&nbsp;
that protects the town. Several wild zombies make&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:48.320
their way to the kid as he yells for help. Just&nbsp;
then, Fido and Bill arrive and ask Mr. Bottoms&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:53.760
to let Timmy in. Bill and Mr. Bottoms get into an&nbsp;
intense fight and Timmy manages to get inside the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:53.760 --> 00:10:00.240
fence again. He points a rifle at Mr. Bottoms and&nbsp;
asks his father to be let free, but Mr. Bottoms&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:06.160
accidentally shoots Bill dead. Timmy then breaks&nbsp;
Fido’s collar and makes him attack Mr. Bottoms.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:12.000
Fido finally kills Bottom and saves Timmy.
Sometime later, Helen organizes a funeral for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.120
Bill. Fido has been freed from imprisonment and&nbsp;
lives with Helen, Timmy, and Helen’s newborn&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:22.560
child. Mr. Bottoms has turned into a zombie and&nbsp;
is controlled by his daughter Cindy. The movie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:25.741
ends as Fido lovingly caresses the newborn baby.&nbsp;
