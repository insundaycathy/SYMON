Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:05.819
Today I'm going to explain a horror, thriller,
and science fiction film called “Elizabeth

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:07.640
Harvest" Spoilers ahead!

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:08.640
Watch out and take care.&nbsp;

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.110
&nbsp;
On the way to their new home, a new bride

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:18.060
named Elizabeth romanticizes the moment while
her husband, Dr. Henry Kellenberg, drives.

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.430
On their arrival, Henry carries Elizabeth
through the doorway and shows her the luxurious

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:23.060
house on top of a hill.

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.330
He then introduces her to Oliver, his son,
and Claire, who is the resident housekeeper.

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:32.220
While looking around the place, Elizabeth
realizes that Oliver is blind, but his disability

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:33.940
does not limit his skills.

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.210
That evening, the newlyweds share dinner in
a grand but intimate setting before ending

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:38.210
the night in their bedroom.&nbsp;

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.960
&nbsp;
The following day, Henry surprises Elizabeth

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.940
with her new closet full of clothes that excites
the new bride.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.970
He continues to show her all the rooms and
features of the house to familiarize the place.

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.210
After touring most of the rooms, a door by
the hallway grabs Elizabeth’s attention

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.180
and she asks Henry what’s inside.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.580
He explains that although the whole house
and everything inside it are already hers,

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.440
that particular room is off-limits.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.950
He also makes her promise not to enter it
no matter what.

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.309
When she does, Henry kisses her in the hallway
while Claire looks at them from a distance.&nbsp;

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:06.860
&nbsp;
In their bedroom, Henry informs Elizabeth

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.710
that he won’t be around tomorrow because
of some work matters.

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.890
She raises concerns about not wanting to be
left in the house, but he insists that she

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.180
stay and see this as an opportunity to be
comfortable in her new home.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.720
She then wakes up to an empty bed and makes
use of the pool because of her boredom.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.780
She explores the house and Claire asks her
if she is hungry.

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.260
Before Claire prepares a meal, Elizabeth asks
her about Henry, but the housekeeper is not

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.810
too keen on sharing any information about
him.

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.310
Elizabeth spends the rest of her day reading
a book, sipping on some chocolate milkshake,

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.430
trying on clothes, and wearing jewelry.

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.189
To end the night, she takes a bath and sees
the two housekeepers go home.

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.340
Elizabeth has trouble sleeping and curiosity
soon gets the best of her.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.250
She breaks Henry’s only rule and goes toward
the forbidden room.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.750
The room seems like a laboratory where she
sees six metal drawers with vital signs monitors

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.180
displayed on each one.

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.700
She is too interested in what lies behind
the drawer, so she presses a button that opens

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:53.700
it.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.920
To her surprise, the drawers are cryogenic
pods that contain bodies.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.840
Horror grabs her throat when she sees a clone
of herself lying unconscious and preserved.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.270
Terrified by the sight of this, she runs back
to the bedroom to try and calm herself down

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.380
and tries to contact anyone, but the signal
is down, causing her to panic more.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.109
&nbsp;
Unknowingly, Elizabeth falls asleep and wakes

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:13.749
up the next day, still not over the fact that
she saw a clone of herself.

00:02:13.749 --> 00:02:17.940
That day, Henry has returned home, playing
the piano for her, while looking at him with

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:18.940
suspicion.

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.749
Because of this, she feels uncomfortable around
him, but she acts as if nothing happened to

00:02:21.749 --> 00:02:23.349
make herself safe.

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:26.769
Henry notices her meek behavior, and he senses
that Elizabeth has seen what is inside the

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:28.930
forbidden room, calling her a good liar.

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.930
However, she denies his subtle accusations,
so he suggests that they send the housekeepers

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.090
home so that they could spend the day alone.

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.809
Both of them have an intimate moment together,
but Elizabeth has lost faith in her husband,

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:40.670
knowing that she is in great danger.

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.079
In the middle of the night, Henry gets out
of bed, and so does Elizabeth.

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:47.599
She looks down at the basement where the forbidden
room is, but Henry comes from behind her,

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:49.290
saying, “Elizabeth my pet.”

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.989
In a sinister way, he holds his machete while
revealing that he is aware of her trespassing

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:55.310
into the room, which frightens her so much.

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.049
She runs away from him in an attempt to escape,
but the doors are entirely locked, making

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:00.790
her hide in the wine cellar.

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.059
During that nerve-wracking night, Henry decides
to just wait for her in the living room, and

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:07.269
Elizabeth makes her way upstairs, thinking
that the coast is clear.

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:11.029
From the fireplace, she grabs an iron poker
as her only tool of self-defense.

00:03:11.029 --> 00:03:15.120
She climbs up the stairs, where Henry grabs
her foot from below, causing her to fall.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.590
While she lays on the floor, he mercilessly
kills her with the machete, abruptly ending

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.779
her life and their marriage all at once.

00:03:20.779 --> 00:03:22.560
&nbsp;
To hide the evidence, Claire and Oliver help

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.599
him dispose of Elizabeth's body in the garden.

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:28.980
Oddly enough, the three seem pretty experienced
in doing it, as if killing and burying a person

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.699
is not new to their nature.

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:34.480
After the body’s disposal, the three of
them eat breakfast together, but this time,

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.049
Henry is not treated as the boss but rather
an accomplice.

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:41.669
On the same day, Logan, a detective who also
happens to be Henry’s friend, visits him

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:42.959
and shares a drink.

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:46.510
Logan asks about Elizabeth, but Henry brushes
the topic off by steering the conversation

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.269
toward Logan’s work life.

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:51.219
Henry gives him advice on dealing with the
strain of employment to steer the topic away

00:03:51.219 --> 00:03:52.219
from him altogether.&nbsp;

00:03:52.219 --> 00:03:54.709
&nbsp;
In Claire’s separate quarter, Oliver visits

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:58.359
and gives her flowers, which she refuses to
accept, saying that he should stop being nice

00:03:58.359 --> 00:03:59.359
to her.

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:03.110
He asks why she still serves Henry despite
being unhappy, but she says they have unfinished

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:04.299
business.

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:07.900
Oliver accuses her of being in love with Henry,
but she just calls him immature.

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.669
To get rid of him, she accepts the flowers
hesitantly.&nbsp;

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:12.409
&nbsp;
Weeks later, another “Elizabeth” is on

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:14.659
the way home, just as what happened to the
one before.

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:16.590
It is complete deja vu.

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.380
Again, he carries her to the home entrance,
tours her around, and gives her gifts for

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:21.530
their marriage.

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:24.860
The new Elizabeth also asks Henry about the
forbidden room, and he gives his warning speech

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.210
once again, to which she agrees to abide.

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:31.620
Again, Henry gets to experience their honeymoon,
just with another version of his bride.

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.509
That night, he informs her that he will leave
in the morning, just as he did last time.

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:39.020
Now alone in the house, she entertains herself
by looking at the paintings in the art gallery

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:40.789
and dressing up just for fun.

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:44.449
However, she runs out of things to do, so
she decides to sneak into the forbidden room

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:46.310
she promised not to enter.

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:49.720
Inside the lab, she opens the drawer and sees
her clone, which frightens her enough to run

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:50.730
away.

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:54.039
Unlike the last time, the clone opens her
eyes and gets up after being preserved for

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:55.340
a long time.

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.680
She seems confused about her whereabouts and
identity, so she blankly walks around the

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:59.870
home undressed.

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:03.340
Disturbingly, she enters the bedroom where
Elizabeth has fallen asleep and touches her

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:04.729
body as if she is someone familiar.&nbsp;

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:07.150
&nbsp;
Elizabeth wakes up to Henry greeting her good

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.250
morning before informing her that he gave
Claire a day off, leaving the both of them

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:11.370
in the house.

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:14.699
In the bathroom, she acts frantically because
of her puzzled thoughts about her marriage,

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:16.340
the room, and her safety.

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:19.610
Without consent, Henry enters the bathroom
and proceeds to wet a towel while telling

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:22.130
Elizabeth that he is aware of her entering
the room.

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:25.710
He uses the towel to choke her, but she is
able to fight back and be free from him.

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:29.020
She hurriedly runs downstairs to the front
door, but it is ineffective since the system

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:30.590
is completely locked.

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:33.530
Because of this, she grabs a knife from the
kitchen while Henry prepares halothane to

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:34.970
knock her unconscious.

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:38.129
The trembling Elizabeth stays in the kitchen
when Henry calmly approaches the piano to

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:41.979
play some music but leaves just as the recorder
continues the musical piece.

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:45.599
Thinking that Henry is preoccupied with playing,
she gets up, allowing him to come from behind

00:05:45.599 --> 00:05:47.710
and put the towel against her face.

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:51.590
Elizabeth twitches around because of the chemical’s
contents, and after acting like she is unconscious,

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:53.569
she stabs Henry on the back of his neck.

00:05:53.569 --> 00:05:57.330
The couple lies beside each other, where moments
later, Elizabeth regains her strength and

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:59.340
sees her husband in a pool of blood.

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:02.840
She tries to unlock the door by using his
fingerprints, but all are invalid, leaving

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:06.310
her no choice but to clean the space before
Oliver and Claire find out.

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:09.900
She drags the body to the elevator after deciding
to clean herself up, covering any evidence

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:11.030
of the event that took place.&nbsp;

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:13.819
&nbsp;
Excessively tired, Elizabeth falls asleep

00:06:13.819 --> 00:06:16.860
in the living room and is woken up by the
sound of a ringing phone.

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:20.340
She immediately gets up to contact emergency
services, saying that she is locked inside

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:22.590
the house, with no means of opening it.

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:26.110
Seeing Oliver and Claire on the way to the
house, she drops the call to avoid any suspicions

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:27.289
from the two.

00:06:27.289 --> 00:06:30.910
Upon their entrance, Elizabeth greets them,
which makes them completely aback—seeing

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:32.130
her still alive.

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:35.310
Claire realizes that something is amiss after
hearing that Henry is upstairs because he

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:36.900
is “not feeling well.”&nbsp;

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:40.659
Henry never stays upstairs, leaving Elizabeth
unsupervised, especially that her clones are

00:06:40.659 --> 00:06:42.430
killed by him for not long.

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:45.379
Claire could not wrap her head around the
fact that something terrible has happened

00:06:45.379 --> 00:06:48.960
to Henry, so she comes to the kitchen and
experiences a heart attack.

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:52.169
Emergency services arrive at the home, and
Elizabeth sees this as a perfect opportunity

00:06:52.169 --> 00:06:54.060
to escape or ask for help.

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:58.159
However, Oliver warns her that the police
will eventually find out about Henry’s murder.

00:06:58.159 --> 00:07:01.199
She tells him that she killed her husband
out of self-defense, and Oliver assures her

00:07:01.199 --> 00:07:04.169
that everything will be fine as long as she
listens to him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.169 --> 00:07:05.639
&nbsp;
Both of them team up to dispose of his body

00:07:05.639 --> 00:07:07.460
in the backyard secretly.

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:11.009
Oliver reveals that Elizabeth is a product
of biogenesis, an experiment led by Henry

00:07:11.009 --> 00:07:13.060
and Claire, who are both doctors.

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:16.580
They talk about the contents of the forbidden
room, where six identical genetic copies or

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:17.969
clones are present.

00:07:17.969 --> 00:07:21.660
According to Oliver, she is the fifth clone
of the Elizabeth Harvest project.

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:24.349
Elizabeth cannot comprehend anything and just
breaks into tears.

00:07:24.349 --> 00:07:27.960
Moments later, Detective Logan makes his way
to the house for another regular visit which

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:31.139
means that they should prepare themselves
to brush off any suspicions.

00:07:31.139 --> 00:07:34.750
Logan is surprised that Elizabeth is the one
welcoming him, as Henry never misses a meeting

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:35.770
with him.

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:39.789
Out of nowhere, Logan asks Elizabeth if she
contacted emergency services because the station

00:07:39.789 --> 00:07:42.759
informs him that a “Mrs. Kellenberg” called
to get some help.

00:07:42.759 --> 00:07:46.820
Oliver saves her by saying that the emergency
was actually for Claire, who is now hospitalized.

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:51.090
Unconvinced, Logan asks more about the situation,
but Oliver comes from behind with a rifle

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:53.210
and shoots the helpless detective.

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:56.690
Despite his loss of sight, his aim is exceptional;
he assures Elizabeth that she does not feel

00:07:56.690 --> 00:07:59.930
bad about Logan because he stopped one of
the clones to escape death, bringing her back

00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:01.699
to the house for Henry to kill.

00:08:01.699 --> 00:08:05.310
He also admits that Henry is only motivated
by killing the clones after reliving the honeymoon

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:06.310
phases.

00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:09.509
As he gives her more information about the
experiment, Elizabeth becomes more frantic

00:08:09.509 --> 00:08:13.669
because of her identity crisis, but they have
to store the body in the backyard once again.

00:08:13.669 --> 00:08:18.279
There, Oliver advises her to pack her bags,
run away as far as possible, and bring a significant

00:08:18.279 --> 00:08:20.159
amount of money with her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:20.159 --> 00:08:21.650
&nbsp;
Elizabeth proceeds to pack her bags; while

00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:24.770
gathering her things, Oliver enters to ask
her if she could read Claire’s journal to

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:25.780
him.

00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:29.059
Feeling sorry for his inability to read, she
opens the journal, but he locks her inside

00:08:29.059 --> 00:08:30.159
the closet.

00:08:30.159 --> 00:08:33.710
Out of agitation, she screams after being
tricked by a blind boy.

00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:36.360
Feeling defeated, she decides to read the
journal to pass the time.

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:39.899
Claire’s story starts five years ago, on
the day she was invited by Henry to take part

00:08:39.899 --> 00:08:41.060
in his study.

00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:44.350
He found Claire’s work about neurogeneration
very intriguing, but the rest of the medical

00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:46.399
field are against their views on this study.

00:08:46.399 --> 00:08:50.470
The journal entries reveal that the real Elizabeth,
who was Henry's wife, died of a rare medical

00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:52.250
condition after giving birth to Oliver.

00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:56.139
Unable to deal with her passing, Henry decided
to create and harvest clones of Elizabeth

00:08:56.139 --> 00:08:59.510
and hired Claire to help him perfect the process
by “cracking the code.”&nbsp;

00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:02.709
After three years of endless tests, she got
the formula, and they started to prepare the

00:09:02.709 --> 00:09:04.180
body for completion.

00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:07.760
To instill memories in her, Henry recorded
messages and played music for the subjects

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:09.819
every night to let information be absorbed
in their minds.&nbsp;

00:09:09.819 --> 00:09:12.190
&nbsp;
The initial test attempts were abortive because

00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:15.570
one of the clones appeared disoriented and
mentally incapacitated.

00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:18.760
After discovering the forbidden room, she
runs away and manages to step foot outside

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:20.950
the house, but Logan brings her back.

00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:24.890
In the present, Oliver brings supper for Elizabeth,
so she knocks him to the ground after he opens

00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:25.980
the door.

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:29.390
She tries to extract the front door code,
where Oliver tells her a combination of numbers

00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:30.779
after being tied.

00:09:30.779 --> 00:09:34.460
As she proceeds to the front door, she realizes
that the code is invalid and goes back to

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:36.990
Oliver to confront him, but he has escaped.

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:40.279
Fearfully, she grabs a knife before going
to the lab, where she sees Oliver tending

00:09:40.279 --> 00:09:41.700
to one of the clones.

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:45.420
According to him, he refuses to let Elizabeth
go if she does not disclose the contents of

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:49.330
the journal and informs him how much Claire
knows about the Elizabeth Harvest project.

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:53.190
While Elizabeth looks at her clone intently,
Oliver tranquilizes her, and she gets unconscious

00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:54.190
as a result.&nbsp;

00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:56.170
&nbsp;
Now a prisoner of Oliver, Elizabeth is tied

00:09:56.170 --> 00:09:59.209
to a metal chain in their bedroom, strictly
kept inside.

00:09:59.209 --> 00:10:02.329
No matter how much she tries to be free from
it, her strength is not enough to unchain

00:10:02.329 --> 00:10:03.389
herself.

00:10:03.389 --> 00:10:06.610
She continues to read the journal and finds
out that years ago, the cloned Elizabeth who

00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:09.310
Logan returned has died because of “suffocation.”

00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:13.410
Henry claims that he has no idea why, but
Claire’s suspicions are already present.

00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:15.990
Despite this, she and Henry shared a short-lived
affair.

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:19.389
While she is busy reading, Oliver enters the
room to give her food and asks her if Claire

00:10:19.389 --> 00:10:22.730
has disclosed any information about him in
the journal, but Elizabeth says that Claire

00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:24.440
did not write about him at all.

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:27.610
When she tells Oliver this, he reveals that
Henry blinded him out of jealousy during his

00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:30.750
childhood because he did not like Oliver's
growing friendship with one of the clones

00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:34.589
as a child, and after Oliver confronted him
of molesting one of the clones.

00:10:34.589 --> 00:10:37.589
Henry attacked Oliver in his sleep but claimed
that it was because of an electrical fire

00:10:37.589 --> 00:10:38.589
that made him blind.&nbsp;

00:10:38.589 --> 00:10:40.780
&nbsp;
In the journal, Claire writes that she did

00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:44.350
not find any birth records of the true Elizabeth,
putting her under the impression that Oliver

00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:47.190
is not their son but rather a person made
up by Henry.

00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:50.760
She suspects that Oliver is a younger clone
of Henry, the revelation of which Claire asked

00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:53.060
Henry about, and he did not deny it.

00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:56.320
Finding out about this, Elizabeth grows more
afraid for her life.

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:59.899
While she sleeps, Oliver comes up to her,
holding a knife against her neck, desperately

00:10:59.899 --> 00:11:02.280
asking if Claire has written anything about
him.

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:05.620
The nervous Elizabeth tells him about Claire’s
suspicion, but she assures Oliver that he

00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:08.240
is not Henry because he can still change his
ways.

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:12.010
She then tries seducing him in hopes of letting
his guards down, which she succeeds at, making

00:11:12.010 --> 00:11:14.070
him say the code to unlock the door.

00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:17.480
After hitting him repeatedly, the sixth Elizabeth
appears holding a rifle and points it at the

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:19.070
fifth Elizabeth.

00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:22.600
Confused about what is happening, she experiences
a dilemma on who to believe.

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:24.910
She instructs Elizabeth to fall to the ground.&nbsp;

00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:28.930
She spots the scissors and uses them to stab
Oliver and shield herself with his body.

00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:33.130
Disoriented, the new clone shoots and kills
Oliver, which also wounds Elizabeth, but she

00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:35.820
still makes her way outside in desperation
to escape.

00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:39.800
Upon her exit, she is fatally wounded by the
new clone, but before she dies, she tells

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:41.850
the clone to read Claire’s journal.&nbsp;

00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:43.610
&nbsp;
The new Elizabeth reads Claire’s journal,

00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:47.200
which tells how Henry and Claire met and details
their work together on the Elizabeth Harvest

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:48.200
project.

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:51.440
She also finds out that Claire discovered
that Henry simply wanted to relive his honeymoon

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:54.620
night with each new cloned Elizabeth before
brutally killing them.

00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:57.620
This horrified Claire so much, but she still
chose to take his side.

00:11:57.620 --> 00:12:00.520
In the present, Claire has recovered from
her heart attack and returns to the house

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:02.820
where the final Elizabeth awaits her entrance.

00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:06.000
She welcomes Claire, hands her the journal,
and tells her to put her studies to better

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.960
use after saying that she has earned the luxurious
home.

00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:12.049
Elizabeth makes her way outside, willing to
start a life of her own independently.&nbsp;
