00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.450
then she thanks him, and they leave.

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.860
Later that night, Ellie asks her dad, why
don’t pets live as long as people? he assures

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.300
her that pets go to heaven and she then asks,
so they go to Pet Cemetery after they die?

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:55.130
And he explains further that it’s not a
bad thing, its natural and death is natural,

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.510

but they assure her not to worry.

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.820
She then asks, why her mom’s sister died
when she was young.

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.900
In flashback, Young Rachel is seen walking
in the room while her sister is in a strange

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.319
state on the bed.

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:13.260
Louis tells her that their daughter is now
9 years old, and they should reveal it to

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.650
her that there is no heaven and no hell after
we die, according to him.

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.870
The next day, at the university hospital,
there is an emergency, a student named Victor

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.630
is badly injured, new nurses are panicking
while looking at his bad injuries, but Louis

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.950
tries to save him and unfortunately, he dies.

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.849
Later at work, he sees Victor waking up and
telling him not to break the barrier in a

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:37.620
vision.

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.560
Few hours later, Louis is sad, and he is sitting
with their cat outside the home, his wife

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.750
comes there, and Louis tells her what happened.

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.170
She suggests him to take a few days off from
work.

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.080
The next day, Ellie goes to their neighbour
Jud’s home, the man who helped her in the

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.760
Cemetery earlier, she got cookies for him,
Ellie invites him to visit her family and

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.740

And she shows everyone her Ballet dance, Rachel
asks him if the Pet Cemetery is part of their

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:09.460
land, and he says even beyond cemetery it’s
only your land.

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:14.311
Later that night, Louis is unrest and cannot
sleep, he then hears victor's voice, and he

00:03:14.311 --> 00:03:20.130

help me and now I will help you, in the cemetery,

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.760
victor warns him not to interfere with anything.

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.840
He then wakes up in the morning, and he notices
that his feet and the sheets are filled with

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.540
mud, suggesting that those events were more
than just a nightmare.

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.519
Kids are playing and He realizes it’s the
day of Halloween, outside we see Jud doing

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:37.870
a gesture to call him.

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.640
Then he shows him that their Cat is dead,
Jud explains that a truck ran over it, and

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.320
they should bury it.

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.240
Later that night, Louis asks his wife to be
comfortable and tell him why she is being

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:54.470
upset past few days, Rachel reveals that she
can’t stop thinking about her sister Zelda

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:59.290
and that her sister used to hate her because
her spine is not twisted like hers.

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:04.000
One day when they both were alone, Rachel
delivered her food through Dumbwaiter shaft

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.330
her family made.

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:10.580
Sooner, only to find out that Zelda tried
moving and she fell down the Shaft, that killed

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.480
her.

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.660
Louis tries to comfort Rachel who is collapsing
from her past trauma, and they agree to lie

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.930
on Ellie, that Church ran away.

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:24.940
Later, Jud takes Louis to the pet cemetery
so they can bury the cat, Jud asks him if

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:30.090
he wants to see his daughter happy, and upon
hearing an instant yes, Jud asks him to follow

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:35.180
him as he climbs across the wooden stock piled
up, as they walk louis sees a symbol that

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:40.360
looks kind of like Naruto’s Konoha, then
they walk in water that is filled with bones,

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:45.460
then they come across an ancient burial ground,
he asks him to bury it by himself and he cannot

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:46.560
interfere.

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.300
Later, he comes back to home and Rachel thanks
him for being there.

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:55.000
The next day, the couple reveals it to Ellie
that church ran away.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.931
However, Ellie claims that church is in their
closet, and he came back last night, Louis

00:04:59.931 --> 00:05:03.090
goes to check it, and he finds him there.

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:07.520
Later, he goes to Jud, and he asks him what’s
going on?

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.560
Jud claims that he wanted to see his daughter
happy so he helped him, Jud further claims

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:15.500
that there are places on earth, which are
older than both of them and even science cannot

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.889
find some answers, and they did what they
did just for Ellie.

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:25.220
Later, Louis tries to do some research behind
the pet cemetery, Ellie is trying to brush

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:29.960
her cat, but it gets stuck, and church attacks
her.

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.919
Louis assures her that church is just having
mood swings.

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:38.020
Later, Rachel tries to assure him that he
did the right thing, then they start having

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:39.740
a hormone sandwich.

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:44.210
However, church is seen tearing and eating
a bird alive and they stop and call it for

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:45.210
the day.

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:50.669
The next day, Louis goes to basement to get
church, and he sees a dark room and suddenly

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:53.780
light emerges from it, pushing Louis away.

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:59.370
In meantime, Rachel is upstairs, and she hears
the noise of a dumbwaiter shaft, she follows

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:02.180
it, and she has a similar vision like her
past.

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:07.650
Afraid from everything she goes to Louis,
and he hugs by assuring her that if he could

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:10.680
turn this around, he would.

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:16.060
The next day, Ellie is doing some drawings,
Louis takes one of it, and he notices a drawing

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:20.520
that looks little violent, and Ellie tells
him that Gage did it, he goes to Gage and

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:24.540
sees that Church is about to attack him, he
saves his son.

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:29.070
Few hours later, Jud reveals to him that the
burial ground brings things back from the

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:33.760
dead and it is believed to be inhabited by
spirit known as the Wendigo.

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:38.230
And the town built wooden wall around the
burial ground to keep people away.

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:43.039
He apologizes and he says he just wanted to
help him and “sometimes the dead is better”.

00:06:43.039 --> 00:06:48.039
Later, Louis attempts to euthanize Church,
but he couldn’t do it, so he decides to

00:06:48.039 --> 00:06:50.920
go in the wild and free him to live on his
own.

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:53.389
Church is making sound of purring.

00:06:53.389 --> 00:06:59.030
During the 9th Birthday of Ellie, she looks
sad, as everyone wishes her, then Louis tries

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:03.360
to talk to her, and he gives her a teddy and
she looks happy again.

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:08.550
Later, As Louis is playing blindfold with
the kids in party, Ellie notices church on

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:14.180
the road, a tanker truck is also seen on the
road, Little Gage and Louis, they both run

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:17.800
in sports mode to save Ellie, but the truck
couldn’t stop.

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:21.660
So, the driver tries to save her but that
kills her on her birthday.

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:27.449
Later, the family is devastated, and they’re
seen in her funeral.

00:07:27.449 --> 00:07:32.990
There is sadness in the house, Rachel says
she keeps hearing footsteps of her daughter.

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:37.440
The next day, Rachel and Gage leave to spend
a few days with Rachel’s parents away from

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:39.330
everything.

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:45.270
Louis is alone at home, he goes to see Jud
and they both share a drink, Jud apologizes

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:49.310
that he shouldn’t have showed him the place,
and warns him that “sometimes dead is better”,

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:54.680
Jud is crying, and he passes out, it turns
out Louis mixed a drug in his drink.

00:07:54.680 --> 00:08:01.530
Later, Rachel calls him, but he says, if they
talk tomorrow, it is better.

00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:05.690
Later that night, Jud goes to the graveyard,
and he starts digging up the grave of their

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:07.160
daughter.

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:09.440
He takes the sleeping Ellie out from it.

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:13.509
Meanwhile, Rachel is getting visions of her
dead sister Zelda.

00:08:13.509 --> 00:08:18.850
In the pet cemetery, victor suggests him to
let go of everything, but Louis denies.

00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:23.400
He then takes her body to the burial ground,
and he buries her while apologizing and mourning

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:25.800
of her death.

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:31.430
Few hours later, Louis wakes up and he walks
only to find Church in the house, he then

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:36.279
goes to their basement, and he comes across
Ellie, she is no longer dead, and he gives

00:08:36.279 --> 00:08:38.559
her a hug and he cries from joy.

00:08:38.559 --> 00:08:44.500
Later, as he is washing her hair, her face
looks different, he tries to brush it, just

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:49.579
like last time when Ellie was trying to brush
Church, the brush gets stuck and he notices

00:08:49.579 --> 00:08:52.839
stitches in her skull, maybe from autopsy.

00:08:52.839 --> 00:08:57.759
Later, Louis prepares her bed, and she wants
to see her mom and Gage.

00:08:57.759 --> 00:08:59.870
He says soon they’ll be back.

00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:05.009
She wants him to stay with her, and she thanks
him for bringing her back from the dead.

00:09:05.009 --> 00:09:10.480
The next day, Jud wakes up thinking it was
a nightmare, Louis goes downstairs, and he

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:16.149
sees his daughter doing Ballet just like before,
but this time she is violent and aggressive,

00:09:16.149 --> 00:09:19.459
Rachel tries calling him, but he won’t answer.

00:09:19.459 --> 00:09:24.800
Rachel is stuck in traffic and then she calls
Jud that Louis is not answering the calls,

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:29.399
he goes to his house and notices his nails,
it look like as if he was digging something,

00:09:29.399 --> 00:09:33.850
he warns him that if you have done something
it’s not too late to undo it.

00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:38.429
While leaving he sees Ellie in the loft, he
flees from there to his home and he prepares

00:09:38.429 --> 00:09:39.899
his gun.

00:09:39.899 --> 00:09:45.040
He hears the voice of church, so he goes upstairs,
he sees church and then Ellie stabs his feet

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:47.069
with a scalpel.

00:09:47.069 --> 00:09:51.470
She then goes to him and takes off her mask,
she taunts him of his dead wife by using her

00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:55.980
face, and then she stabs him multiple times
killing him.

00:09:55.980 --> 00:10:01.829
Sooner, Rachel and Gage return home, she notices
the marks on his hand, and she ask’s him

00:10:01.829 --> 00:10:03.440
what’s going on?

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:06.579
He says he wasn’t ready to say goodbye to
their daughter.

00:10:06.579 --> 00:10:12.240
Ellie walks to them alive, and she hugs Rachel,
hurting her by it, and horrified Rachel runs

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:14.720
to upstairs with Gage.

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:18.470
Then Louis explains to her that the burial
ground brought her back to life and this was

00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:20.509
the best thing to do.

00:10:20.509 --> 00:10:25.470
He then hears someone screaming from Jud’s
house, so he goes there, in the bedroom Rachel

00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:29.499
hears voice of her sister and she gets a vision
that she is in place of her sister on the

00:10:29.499 --> 00:10:35.170
bed, then the dumbwaiter shaft opens and someone
comes out of it and her spine starts twisting

00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:40.379
in a brutal manner, and she wakes up, only
to be attacked by Ellie with a knife, she

00:10:40.379 --> 00:10:44.920
cuts her and stabs her, but Rachel manages
to run from there.

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:49.199
Louis sees their cat church, along with Jud’s
body full of blood.

00:10:49.199 --> 00:10:53.889
Rachel breaks the window, and she passes Gage
from there to him, and then she is stabbed

00:10:53.889 --> 00:10:56.769
by Ellie, and she says do you want a hug Mommy?

00:10:56.769 --> 00:10:59.199
And then she stabs her again.

00:10:59.199 --> 00:11:03.949
Louis goes and locks Gage in the car and he
comes upstairs to Rachel, and then Ellie knocks

00:11:03.949 --> 00:11:08.850
him unconscious, and she drags Rachel’s
body to the burial ground.

00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:19.529
Ellie stabs him with the knife, and soon he
overpowers her, and he starts chocking her,

00:11:19.529 --> 00:11:24.010
when he tries to kill her, he is taken down
by now undead Rachel.

00:11:24.010 --> 00:11:28.989

bury Rachel behind the pet cemetery, Ellie
manipulates and promises him that they will
