If you got infected by a zombie virus and only had 48 hours left to live, what would you do with your baby? In this How to Beat video, we\xe2\x80\x99ll follow the characters, see if we can make better decisions, and ultimately attempt to beat the Fracking Virus in, Cargo. If you think you have a better way, let me know in the comments! If you like these how to beat videos, consider subscribing. We start out following Andy, who\xe2\x80\x99s with his wife Kay, and his baby, Rosie. They\xe2\x80\x99re on a float trip through an Australian river. They come across another family who\xe2\x80\x99re having a little birthday picnic, the dad doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem too friendly though. Andy anchors the boat down for the night, and fishes out a containment assistance package. Okay, so it\xe2\x80\x99s not a fun little float trip. He pops the package open, and the text on the first pamphlet reads, \xe2\x80\x9cA guide to help prepare you and your family to recognize threats and make smart decisions in dangerous situations.\xe2\x80\x9d I can tell you right now they didn\xe2\x80\x99t read this at all. Andy flips past all that extraneous bullshit until he gets to a big colorful picture he can actually understand. It looks like Australia is pretty much annihilated by now. To make matters worse, they only have a couple PB&amp;J\xe2\x80\x99s left. Andy and Kay are arguing about the plan, which was originally to float down the river until they reach a military base with a nearby hospital. Kay\xe2\x80\x99s second guessing that they will make it with food running low and the possibility of the engine failing. She wants to stop the boat, grab a car, and head 40km inland to a remote town. I guess you didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand the big colorful picture in the pamphlet. Let me help, you\xe2\x80\x99re traveling down the Murray River, and according to the red, high infection zones on the map, you are not outrunning it, because it\xe2\x80\x99s all around you. Even though the infection is everywhere, I do think that heading for the remote town is a decent option. By now Andy and Kay have experienced the initial onslaught of the virus, and have read some of that pamphlet. They should know that the zombies are slow, easy to avoid, and that the virus is transmitted through bodily fluids. Driving into a remote town wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be that dangerous. There would be less zombies, and maybe the town has some unpicked food and supplies. It could be a decent place to hold out, have a nice cold pint, and wait for this all to blow over. With the zombies being slow and uncoordinated, it\xe2\x80\x99s likely the military successfully fought the zombies back. So I'd still make a pass by the base before spending months on a potato farm. What I don\xe2\x80\x99t like is that houseboat. It can barely push 5-6mph, which makes their journey to the base take weeks. Not ideal when food is an issue. Not only that, but it\xe2\x80\x99s slow speed and the need to park it each night makes it vulnerable to zombie attacks. Just jack a truck, fill it with the gas from the boat, and since you can go 10 times as fast as the houseboat, you can check out both the military base and the town before your food runs out. Andy convinces Kay to stay the course, and they continue floating towards the military base. We cut over to a little kid surviving on her own, using a rock and tree branch to simulate watching Netflix. Man, things are pretty dire. A lot of people would have hung themselves from a tree before this point. Andy spots a wrecked boat named Serendipity. You gotta appreciate the irony. He jumps on top and sticks an oar down the hatch with a mirror attached to see if anyone\xe2\x80\x99s home...clever. I\xe2\x80\x99d also bang on the side of the boat to see if I could rustle up a person or zombie lurking within. There didn\xe2\x80\x99t appear to be anyone in the boat, so he hops down into it. He\xe2\x80\x99s barehanded, which is never a good idea when looting in the zombie apocalypse. There\xe2\x80\x99s usually a bathroom in these boats too. With his mirror he should be able to see if the door was closed. Since it was closed, he should be extra cautious about a zombie sitting on the toilet. Andy hits the jackpot and starts bagging the canned food and wine, but all the commotion awakens the toilet zombie. If these were 28 weeks later zombies, Andy would definitely be dead. He hightails the goods back to the houseboat where he reveals the discovery to Kay. Of course he lies about it being perfectly safe so she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t freak out about how dangerous it was. God forbid you\xe2\x80\x99re honest and say that yah, it was way too risky and dangerous and that you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have done it, and that you think there was something in the boat\xe2\x80\x99s bathroom. Andy goes off to take a nap, and Kay decides to sneak off to the wrecked boat. Why, just why? Yah, Andy said it\xe2\x80\x99s safe, but there is no legitimate reason to go back to that boat. At least Andy had a reason, that they were running out of food. But now that they have enough food to continue their trip down the river without going hungry, there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason to take these kinds of risks. Why does she have to sneak off too, it\xe2\x80\x99s the apocalypse, a little teamwork and communication goes a long way. Kay basically gets killed because she wanted to surprise her husband with a fucking razor for his beard, which apparently is a very pressing issue to her. At least she got it. Andy wakes up from his nap, only to find his bloody mess of a wife in the bathroom with a severe bite wound on her thigh. Kay throws on a watch that came with the containment package, which shows how many hours of life you have left. Damn, FitBits have gotten hardcore. According to Kay\xe2\x80\x99s, she has 48 hours until she\xe2\x80\x99s a zombie, probably much less considering how badly she was bitten. Andy throws all containment considerations out the window and handles her bloody wound with his bare hands. Just don\xe2\x80\x99t itch your eye man. Kay gives the pamphlet a second read. It says the infected can\xe2\x80\x99t spread the disease until symptoms appear, which could be in a few hours. Realistically, Kay\xe2\x80\x99s bloody wound is already contagious, and how fast the virus takes over the body actually depends on how and where the disease was transmitted. It's not like you want to hangout until they start coughing to quarantine or dispatch them. The pamphlet also says the auto-injector makes dispatching the infected as easy and safe as possible. Oh that needle isn\xe2\x80\x99t a vaccine, it\xe2\x80\x99s a way to kill yourself. Holy shit that needle is intense. That looks like the needle Nicolas Cage used in the movie The Rock. You\xe2\x80\x99re supposed to put it up to your temple and hit the quick release button if you get infected. Wow. You know the situation is bad when the government is handing out ways to kills yourself instead of vaccines or antidotes. Andy\xe2\x80\x99s in denial about her bite wound, and thinks a river monster bit her instead. It\xe2\x80\x99s pretty obvious it was a zombie though. Ya know, a testing kit would have been nice to include in the containment assistance package. I know it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to come to terms with the fact that she\xe2\x80\x99s a goner, but you can\xe2\x80\x99t let your denial lead you into making more bad decisions. It\xe2\x80\x99s time to say your goodbyes and auto-ject her from the boat. He wants to take her to the hospital in the remote town, because he thinks that she will bleed to death in a few hours. If on the offshoot he\xe2\x80\x99s right, and it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a zombie that bit her, he thinks the doctors could stop her from bleeding out. If he\xe2\x80\x99s wrong and she is infected, well, she\xe2\x80\x99s dead anyways. The problem is that his assumptions aren\xe2\x80\x99t accurate. Her wound is oozing dark blood, which suggests veinous bleeding. Her wound is not life-threatening, and she will not bleed out in hours. Veinous bleeding can be stopped with 10 minutes of direct pressure and leg elevation. I\xe2\x80\x99d cancel that trip to the hospital, quarantine her on shore immediately so she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t spread the disease all over the boat, then pull out the lawn chair and watch her slowly turn into a zombie. The hell it is. Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s your call because you got killed for a Gilette. The best a man can get is a partner that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take unnecessary risks in the zombie apocalypse. Andy already risked his life to get the food. You were set. All you had to do was sit on the boat and have a glass of wine. I guess it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t her call as they went with Andy's idea. Since there are zombies roaming about, it\xe2\x80\x99s a good idea to stay in eye contact at all times, use hand signals, have non-verbal ways to communicate like clapping rocks together, have lures to distract zombies with, and having ranged weapons like spears to defend yourselves with. Not an hour into their journey, they run into burnt corpses, with their heads buried in the ground and spears buried in their skulls. Normally, I'd say this is free food for the iron-stomached survivors, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you can cook off the Fracking Virus so as enticing as it sounds, eating the fried zombie corpses probably isn\xe2\x80\x99t a good idea. We cut back to the lone child again, who\xe2\x80\x99s storyboarding her next Netflix episode. She\xe2\x80\x99s housing and feeding a zombie too, nice. I bet that won\xe2\x80\x99t be a problem later. Kay\xe2\x80\x99s leg wound is so severe she\xe2\x80\x99s hopping around, shopping for baby seats, making toys, and playing pattycake with her baby. Did you just forget that you are hours into an incubation period for an incredibly deadly and infectious disease that turns people into zombies, and what you\xe2\x80\x99re doing is fucking dangerous? Why the sweet Australian outback fuck would you touch this sick ass yellow goop. I\xe2\x80\x99m losing my patience with this chick. Andy, please dome her with the auto-dispatcher already. She\xe2\x80\x99s going to get your baby killed. Hopefully Kay disinfects her hand before she touches anyone else, but we know that\xe2\x80\x99s not gonna happen. All that stuff about communication, eye contact, weapons, lures, would\xe2\x80\x99ve been nice to have with the zombie approaching. I\xe2\x80\x99ll give her some credit for the turn signal move, though. Luckily Andy receives the warning and hops in the car before the zombie catches him. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been waiting for a chance to say that driving 55 mph is the most fuel efficient speed, and saving gas is definitely a concern in the apocalypse. Feels good that this factoid is off my chest, maybe it will save someone\xe2\x80\x99s life one day, who knows. If anything I say in any of my videos ever leads to your survival, like you were in a situation and thought, oh, Nerd Explains said this, and it saved your life, please let me know. If it gets you killed, well, nobody will know. Andy pulls over to check the map, because Kay apparently can\xe2\x80\x99t work the map while he drives. Rosie starts crying because she needs a diaper change. Why would you let her do it? Kay is hours into an infection, and will be showing severe symptoms anytime now. She shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be around you in the car, nor should she be handling the baby and changing it\xe2\x80\x99s diaper. She should be in the trunk so she isn\xe2\x80\x99t spreading her bodily fluids everywhere. Oh my fucking god. That baby could have easily been coughed or puked on. Looks like the kids zombie friend breached containment, who\xe2\x80\x99d have thought feeding zombies like zoo animals was a bad idea. Ooh that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look good. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think she has 48 hours. Finally she gets hit with some sense, but Andy can\xe2\x80\x99t help himself and throws her back in the car. He starts speeding down the dirt roads to get to the definitely abandoned hospital so he can salvage a few extra hours with his wife, when out of nowhere a ninja zombie shows up and causes him to swerve off the road and into a tree, totaling the truck and his wife. I\xe2\x80\x99m more sad about the car at this point. As ridiculous as this was, if you\xe2\x80\x99re in the apocalypse with roaming zombies everywhere, maybe keep your eyes on the road. Andy faints from a panic attack. When he wakes up, he sees \xe2\x80\x98save her\xe2\x80\x99, written in blood. And this.. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure she\xe2\x80\x99ll be fine bro, just pull the tree stump out of her stomach and carry her to the hospital. Kay\xe2\x80\x99s transformation into a zombie is complete, and she bites his arm with her disgusting yellow crusty mouth. So she had time to write \xe2\x80\x98save her\xe2\x80\x99 in her own blood, but not to auto-ject herself before she turned into a zombie with her passed out husband and baby next to her. You know Kay, it\xe2\x80\x99d be easier to save Rosie if you didn\xe2\x80\x99t let yourself turn into a zombie that attacked us. Andy finally auto-jects Kay's head, putting an end to her madness. He throws Rosie into his backpack, straps on the grossly inaccurate watch, and heads out. The kid baits the zombie away from Andy using blood handprints. Why couldn\xe2\x80\x99t you have done that earlier when your zombie was in the road that the car was driving down. Andy makes it to the town and stumbles into a lady who asks what time is left on his watch, not like it matters though. She offers him a spare bed, which is nice, but come on, 46 hours is only if someone sneezes on you. This guy was bit on the arm, by morning he could be zombified. Kind of dangerous to have him chilling around. Off in the distance, aborignal tribes are shish kebabing and frying zombies. You know, this isn\xe2\x80\x99t too far off from the lifestyle I was imagining at the end of the Assimilate video I did. Whaddya know, the hospital is derelict. I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure what Andy\xe2\x80\x99s looking for in the hospital, it\xe2\x80\x99s not like there\xe2\x80\x99s an Antidote. Maybe he\xe2\x80\x99s looking for an easier way to off himself by ODing on drugs. I don\xe2\x80\x99t blame him. Yep, there\xe2\x80\x99s no way this dude is making it the full 48. This man just can not get a good shave in. He wakes up in a makeshift bed with spare clothes next to him. It\xe2\x80\x99s pretty clear Etta saved his ass. She tells him to go find Willie and to avoid the hunting parties that are hunting the infected. Why not tell her that Willie was a zombie, and that the best option would be to leave Rosie in Etta\xe2\x80\x99s care while Andy enjoyed his last moments with her, instead of hiking, fighting zombies, and risking Rosie\xe2\x80\x99s life even more. Andy heads off in search of the zombie dad for god knows what reason. Ah, he\xe2\x80\x99s trying to make it to the military base. Looks like the military didn\xe2\x80\x99t do so hot. Andy finds another truck to jack, so he can go check out the destroyed military base I guess. He gets really lucky that guy comes in with the clutch over the shoulder shot. Yah they are slow, but you can never underestimate how sneaky those ninja zombies are. The man tells Andy that the military base is overrun. Apparently he got his leg pinned under a canister of some sort, so he offers Andy a deal. Help him and he\xe2\x80\x99ll take him back to his home where his wife can help with Rosie. Andy agrees, and they haul ass before more Zombies show up. Vic lives in a nice gated community, and we get introduced to his wife. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem like her type, then again, it\xe2\x80\x99s the apocalypse. Andy leaves the baby with Lorraine, and the boys go on their hunting trip. Honestly this looks like fun. This is about as good as the zombie apocalypse is going to get. Ohhhh, poor little thoomie. Thoomie did inadvertently cause you to crash and get bit by Kay by letting his zombie dad loose. Just saying. Any one of those bullets could have killed the bait, which is just reckless on Vics part. It does seem like the blood and meat work just fine, and you don\xe2\x80\x99t need live bait, this guys just doing this because he\xe2\x80\x99s a psycho. Vic still is one of the only options for securing a new home for your baby, so it\xe2\x80\x99s probably not wise to piss him off by expressing your disapproval. Back at home, Lorraine is playing with Rosie, until she makes a terrible discovery. Ooh maybe letting Kay play with the baby wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a good idea after all. Looks like our pal drummed up some more live bait. He cranks on some jams, splashes some blood on the cage, and heads back to base to make love to his unwilling \xe2\x80\x98wife\xe2\x80\x99. Lorraine didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to mention that Andy\xe2\x80\x99s baby is infected, which makes it even more idiotic that he\xe2\x80\x99s cuddling and kissing her. Maybe the goo was from Andy, which is still idiotic because he was getting infectious zombie goo all over his babies clothes. You know how much babies put stuff in their mouths. The recklessness is just fucking astounding. Andy starts seizing again, and kisses his baby on the forehead before heading outside to dome cap himself. They really lied on the auto-ject that it made dispatching easy. Why not include a poisonous pill or something instead. I could easily see someone fucking this up and holding it too far away or aiming it off center and accidentally lobotomizing themself. Lorraine stops him because she wants his help to get away from Vic. Andy mentions that there\xe2\x80\x99s a family by the river that she could take the baby to. Yah, that dad looked real inviting, it\xe2\x80\x99s definitely worth the 40km trek back to them, if they are still even there. As sucky as it sounds, she just needs to stay shacked up with this dude, play along, convince him to teach her how to shoot and hunt so she can survive on her own, then auto-ject him while he\xe2\x80\x99s sleeping. Since Vic caused the death of her real husband, I think the auto-ject is too painless. She should save some of that yellow goop on the baby from earlier and put it in one of Vic\xe2\x80\x99s meals. Vic catches them conspiring and rifle butts him in the head. Andy wakes up in the cage with Thoomie. That is probably one of the worst designed cages I've ever seen. I get that he might only have access to an animal cage like that, but why not chain them to the cage, instead of just to each other. Andy and Thoomie sneak back into camp to free Lorraine and Rosie. Why would you not shoot him? He\xe2\x80\x99s too dangerous to be left alive. If during your escape, the baby cries or someone knocks something over, Vic could still grab a gun and come out and shoot you, he\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty good shot too. Yep, Vic wakes up and rushes outside with his rifle. As he draws down on Andy, Lorraine jumps out to stop him and gets shot dead. Thoomie and Andy escape and make a stop by the Clever Man\xe2\x80\x99s cage, but he\xe2\x80\x99s gone. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he figured out he could just lift the cage door and walk out too. Vic catches up to them and poses an enticing offer. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what they\xe2\x80\x99re waiting for, Vic sounds like a man who will definitely honor his side of the deal. Why is Andy going to sleep with Thoomie and the baby when he\xe2\x80\x99s in the late stages of infection, he could turn at any point now. Wow, Thoomie\xe2\x80\x99s lucky he didn\xe2\x80\x99t go for her face instead. And why are you sleeping, you literally have hours before you\xe2\x80\x99re dead, you need to be finding a new home for Rosie. Andy gives Thoomi a reality check, that her zombie dad is dead and there\xe2\x80\x99s no cure and the clever man can\xe2\x80\x99t fix her dad. The talk didn\xe2\x80\x99t go over well, as she tries to off herself with a rock. And I thought the auto-ject was a hard way to commit suicide. Thoomie and Andy go separate ways and Andy heads for the river to find the family they passed by earlier. With only 9 hours left of life, he\xe2\x80\x99s really starting to lose it. Just before Andy buries his head in the ground like those other zombozos, Thoomie comes to the rescue. They miraculously find a boat with an engine and eventually Andy\xe2\x80\x99s reunited with the houseboat, memories of Kay, and thoughts of how this could have gone down differently if she just poured a glass of wine instead. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem like things turned out hot for the family. You know that dude had a gun, so maybe don\xe2\x80\x99t sneak into their home and eat their food without knowing if they\xe2\x80\x99re still around. I\xe2\x80\x99d yell to see if they were home. Sure you could attract some zombies, but I'd rather deal with a zombie than a guy with a gun. I\xe2\x80\x99m also still dumbfounded that Andy hasn\xe2\x80\x99t found something to use as a weapon against the zombies this whole time. Thanks doctor thoomie, for the history lesson about why modern medicine and technology has rendered your culture obsolete. They find the river people, but the dad is digging a mass grave. The man tells Andy that after he offs his family with 4 bullets, there will be 2 bullets left for him and Rosie. I\xe2\x80\x99d say that Andy should try to take the gun and stop him, as the wife is the best chance at Rosie being taken care off. Andy declines the offer and heads back to the boat. If I was going to murder my family to mercy kill them, I\xe2\x80\x99d fish out an auto-ject and dome each one while they slept, this way you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to see the look of horror on their faces as they don\xe2\x80\x99t understand why you\xe2\x80\x99re killing them. While Andy contemplates using the revolver on himself, Rosie is sucking on his bloody fitbit. I feel like you have to really, really, really try to get this disease, so how did it spread so fast. Is that really what\xe2\x80\x99s on your mind right now, after witnessing a man murder his family while you had the same gun he used in your mouth. They really should have headed to Thoomi\xe2\x80\x99s tribe instead of the family in a van down by the river. Look, that's you in a few hours Andy. If they needed to hibernate and slow metabolism, why not lie down instead. And if they need the dark, why are you taking me through a dark tunnel. Unfortunately, they run into Vic again. Andy pretends to be a zombie, which is really not a good strat. If that dude used his rifle like he did earlier to dispatch the zombies, you\xe2\x80\x99d be screwed. If the zombies woke up, you\xe2\x80\x99d be screwed. Andy should have run up on him with the gat and emptied it in Vic\xe2\x80\x99s chest. Just before Vic bats his head in, Andy flips the script and opens fire. Andy should have fired both rounds, because Vic grabs the gun and puts a hole in Andy too. Vic knocks Thoomie out, and in a fit of rage almost cranks little Rosie's neck sideways, but doesn\xe2\x80\x99t because that would\xe2\x80\x99ve made this movie obscenely dark and disturbing. Andy helps Thoomie shake off the tweety birds so they can continue their trek to her family. He starts succumbing to the disease, and gets the eye goop and flesh eating libido. Knowing his death is imminent, they forge a new plan. So not only does the government give you a way to kill yourself, but also shackles and a mouthguard? Why, so you can tie up zombies? Thoomie\xe2\x80\x99s fam is demolishing the zombies, but why aren\xe2\x80\x99t they wearing more armor? And why are they waiting until the zombies get close to kill them, just use the throwing spears, those seem to be effective. The zombie piggyback ride is a nice flex, but Thoomie definitely could have carried the baby a couple more miles herself. Seems like an unnecessary risk. The clever man was out there running zombies through too, so it\xe2\x80\x99s safe to say he didn\xe2\x80\x99t have the cure that Thoomie was waiting on for her dad. Andy finds mercy at the end of a spear and the tribe takes the baby into their home. The movie ends. Let\xe2\x80\x99s recap some of the big decisions that could have altered the course of events, and see who we could save, and whose death was inevitable. I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty sure no matter what we did differently, Kay would find a way to get herself killed, so i\xe2\x80\x99m putting her on the dead board permanently. They definitely should have jacked a car instead of the boat, which means the food wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be as much of an issue to go looting wrecked boats for. They\xe2\x80\x99d stop by the military base, see that it was overrun, then head to the remote town to find Etta and the aboriginals. There, they could hold out the apocalypse relatively safely. So Andy, Rosie, Thoomie, Etta, Vic, Lorraine, and the Tribe would all be alive. They\xe2\x80\x99d still have to deal with Vic at some point, because he was putting them in cages. His cages didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem hard to escape, so whoever was captured could free themselves and gather the tribe to hunt him down and free Lorraine. So Vic using people as live bait will probably still lead to his death. The river family and willie were dead either way. Ultimately, I think we could have beaten Andy and Kay\xe2\x80\x99s encounter with the Fracking Virus. Thanks for watching, and remember, lack of communication is the number one relationship killer, especially in the apocalypse.
