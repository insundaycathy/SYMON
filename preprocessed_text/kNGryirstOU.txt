in this movie, we were shown three types of kingdoms, our planet earth, the world of hell and a world where powerful people live. and here everything is quite different. these three kingdoms used to fight a lot because each one wanted to win to rule all the kingdoms. due to their fights, it is decided that there will be a war between them, and this movie is named on that war, mortal kombat. the one who wins will rule over the other kingdoms and will merge all kingdoms into one. this war will have a total of nine rounds. the kingdom where people were powerful was named as outworld. and its leader didn't want to start the mortal combat war because he considered himself very strong and used to kill people without any war. at the beginning of the movie, we were shown the past, where we see a man. his name was hang so, and he was the best warrior of the kingdom earth. he used to live with his wife, son and a little baby girl. they were living very happily. one day, when hangzhou was not at home, an outworld warrior attacks on his home. that man starts killing all people of that area, and then he comes to hangzhou's wife and son. hanzo's wife has hidden the little girl in the basement of their home. but that man freezes hangzo's wife and son and kill them. when hangso comes back, he see that everyone was dead, and he starts to fight him. and during their fight, that man kills hangso. then the soul of hangso goes to the kingdom of hell. and then there come the leader of earth, who take out the little girl from there and take hanzo's knife with him. now the story moves to present where we see that the outworld has already won nine rounds and was ready to rule over the world. but there was also a prediction that hangzo's blood will unite many young people who will fight against that kingdom and will protect their kingdom earth. now the people who were chosen to fight back the kingdom, they had a mark on their body, which was a dragon. a man among them is cole, who used to live with his wife and daughter. and he keeps getting visions of hangzhou and his knife. but he was unable to know that why this was happening. then we see that the same outworld warrior who killed hangso comes to kill him. but a man comes there and saves them. he offers him ride and gives the address of his friend and asks them to go there. and that man himself starts fighting the outworld warrior. outworld warrior freezes his hands and blasts them. then we see cole and his family has reached at that friend's home. that girl's name was sonia, and she tells them that they both were in army, and we were given a task to find those people who had a mark which tells that they are warriors of earth. since then we are doing research on them. she tells cole that he has the same dragon mark on his body, which means that you will also fight mortal kombat, and you were chosen by nature. cole laughs and tells her that she'd just be joking. then sonja says, no, we also have to find other people for the war who have this mark on their body. and you will help me, and you have to join me. then sonia introduces cole to a man who is very angry. he had also the same mark on his body. they were just talking when there comes a reptile looking creature. they fight it, and the lights were also going on and off. but in the end, the angry man kills that reptile-looking creature. now nobody knows actually where to train themselves as the kingdom earth's warriors. but the angry man knew, but he says that he has no interest in this and he is not going to tell anyone. then sonia offers him some money, and he agrees. and then they go there by a plane. this place was a temple in the desert where the warriors were trained, and the leader of kingdom earth has made it there. they meet a temple guide who was also a warrior of kingdom earth. there were paintings of old era, seeing which cole start seeing visions again. then we see sonja's friend as well. he lost his hands, but new mechanical hands were attached to his body. they seemed like robotic hands, and were attached by none other than the leader of the earth, who came there already. he meets all the warriors there and tells them, we don't have much time left for war, and you people aren't still ready, with no power in you. then leader of the outworld comes there, who came here to kill them with his companions. leader of the ear makes a shield between them, due to which the outworld people unable attack them. then we see the brother of that temple guide, who says that we own many powers. can't we join them? let's take the training. his brother agrees. and now they were getting training with warriors. but sonia wasn't getting trained. as her body neither had that mark, nor she had any superpower. during the training, everyone's super powers were being revealed, like temple guide can light up fire with his hands. and his brother has a unique hat, which works like blade. and that angry person can emit laser light from his eyes. but no superpower was revealed for coal yet. leader of kingdom earth asks him, do you know who you are? you are from the great leader hangzhou's tribe. i saved her daughter life years ago, and then you were also born afterwards in the same tribe. but cole replies that i don't want to be the part of this battle. i want to stay with my wife and daughter. then the leader sends him back to his home, and he becomes very happy to get back to home. but on the other hand, the leader from the outworld is preparing his warriors for the battle. he then takes them to attack on the kingdom earth. one of the members of outworld offers angry man plenty of money and power if he joins them. angry man was a greedy man by nature, so he accepts the offer and joins their gang and removes the shield with help of his laser that was originally established by the leader earth kingdom. by destroying the shield, outworld's people gained access to the earth and start extreme fighting. everyone was attacking each other. and when the brother of temple guide is about to kill the leader of outworld, then suddenly a female warrior from outworld comes and attacks him, but he cut her in two pieces by his blade. hat. angry man was also attacking the kingdom earth's people, friend of sonia, was also not in full powers, and his hands were out of function. on the other side, while cole was with his family, they see a giant creature, which suddenly attacks them. when cole sees that he is going to attack his family, then he gets super angry. all of sudden, his superpowers start revealing, and his body starts to get covered with a shield, and two swords appear in his hands, from which he then kills that creature. cole now has an idea that temple is also under attack. and if this world is going to be destroyed, then his family could never be safe too. thinking the same, he goes back to the temple where another female warrior from outworld is trying to kill sonja. then she comes to know that sonja isn't warrior and leaves her. but then the angry man comes there to attack her. he makes her numb. then we see that the hands of sanya's friend are still not working. he tries a lot and becomes angry. then out of sudden, his mechanical hands get very advanced, and he gets power. he lifts the stones around and saves sanya's life. when outworld leader comes to know that coal is from hangzhou's tribe, he tries to kill him and attacks him. but at the very moment, leader of kingdom earth makes a shield where they can live safely. he starts to teleport all the warriors to there. but then the special warrior of outworld leader attacks on coal. brother of temple guide comes there to save coal by his hat. but outworld's leader catches him and takes out his soul. unluckily, no one could save him. and they all get transferred to that shield area where they are safe. there, leader of kingdom earth gives cole a knife. this was the knife of hang so he tells him that if you use this in the war, hangzhou's soul will help you. cole says that we will fight the warriors individually, and in the end, we will fight their special warriors so that none of them could attack us. and then they do the same. sonja's friend and temple guide, kills their two warriors there. now sonia goes to kingdom earth to kill that angry man because he betrayed them. his body
