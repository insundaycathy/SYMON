Welcome to Cinema Summary, ladies and gentlemen. Everyone\xe2\x80\x99s has fantasies, it's when they come to light that they get us in trouble This is Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut. So the movie begins with Dr. Bill Harford and Alice Harford getting ready for a Christmas party hosted by the bill\xe2\x80\x99s client: Victor Ziegler As they leave, they check in with their daughter and the babysitter and then head to the fancy Christmas party with live music, drinks and dances yet the Hartford's know nobody there except for a Mr. Ziegler, Bill\xe2\x80\x99s client, who invites them every year. As they dance, Bill recognizes the pianist as Nick, an old friend who dropped out from med school and goes to talk to him as Alice goes to the \xe2\x80\x98bathroom\xe2\x80\x99, downing a drink as she does so. Bill\xe2\x80\x99s conversation with Nick reveals that Nick now works at the Sonata Cafe, and tells him to drop by when he has time. All the while, Alice stands aloof and away from the crowd drinking her champagne and the thing about aloof women? Some guys see them as a challenge much like this man, Sander Szavost: a well-read, charming Hungarian whose interest in Alice is very apparent and although he can\xe2\x80\x99t take her out, he can ask for a dance. As they dance, Alice sees Bill chatting it up with some broads in the reflection of a mirror and Sander can\xe2\x80\x99t help but ask Alice why she would settle for someone like Bill when she could have any man in the world? Meanwhile, Bill walks arm-in-arm being lead away by the women who coil around him like two snakes but before anything can happen he is asked to meet Mr. Ziegler. Mr. Ziegler wanted Bill\xe2\x80\x99s help since his lady friend, Mandy has a problem. She had a bad reaction after shooting up with heroin and coke and since Bill\xe2\x80\x99s a doctor, he can give her a checkup. and when we see her lying there, she\xe2\x80\x99s lying in the same way as the painting behind Ziegler. As Bill examines her, Sander and Alice are still dancing, Alice in a drunken stupor getting closer and closer to Sander until Sander invites her upstairs to see a collection of bronze sculptures. She leans in, and makes her decision: Not tonight but leaves with a flirty goodbye. Bill concludes that Mandy\xe2\x80\x99s condition is stable and she\xe2\x80\x99ll be okay after an hour or so but she needs to lay off the drugs; Ziegler\xe2\x80\x99s extremely grateful and asks Bill to keep this a secret between them although he shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to since they\xe2\x80\x99re friends. So in case you missed that, Ziegler is a man who cannot be trusted. He had Bill come up \xe2\x80\x98to talk\xe2\x80\x99 to him when in actuality he needed someone to give Mandy a checkup. Ziegler than makes Bill keep this a secret from everyone else because  it would have made him (Ziegler) look bad. He has many such secrets soon to be revealed. Back home, Bill passionately kisses Alice, both of them nude and ready for love, But Alice looks at her reflection, and you can tell she\xe2\x80\x99s either unhappy or frustrated about something and she is clearly hiding it from Bill. The next day, Bill goes to work as Alice stays at home and we see the difference of their lives: the dull, domestic life of Alice in contrast with the lively, professional life of Bill. That evening they smoke a joint, and chill in their room. Under the influence of marijuana, Alice has the courage to ask Bill if he slept with those two girls he was hitting on at the party. Bill denies that he was hitting on anyone: he was busy helping Ziegler to do anything, which brings up the question: Who was she dancing with? Well, just a guy who wanted sex Bill admits that \xe2\x80\x98it\xe2\x80\x99s understandable since Alice is so beautiful\xe2\x80\x99. And Alice flabbergasted, asks him if he meant to say that men only want to approach her because she\xe2\x80\x99s beautiful and Bill kind of admits it. It\xe2\x80\x99s not black and white but you know how men are. From here, the conversation devolves into an argument with Alice trying to get Bill to admit that he does feel sexual attraction for women; that somewhere inside him is a desire to cheat. Finally, Alice asks the question: Why doesn\xe2\x80\x99t Bill feel jealous of other men that hit on Alice? Because I- I believe in you Alice! You're faithful. and she breaks down laughing, "Are you kidding me, Bill?" leaving Bill confused And then sh explains why she' laughing last summer at Cape Codd, she saw a young stud of a naval officer and although Bill and Alice made love that summer, she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stop thinking about the naval officer. She admits that she was ready to break up their marriage, and leave everything she has if that naval officer asked her to do so. It\xe2\x80\x99s a revelation that shatters Bill\xe2\x80\x99s faith but their conversation is interrupted as Bill answers the phone. (By the way, throughout this movie, in high stress situations for Bill, something interrupts him usually a phone or a doorbell ringing) It's about his patient, Lou Nathanson who has died and Bill has to go over. As he rides in the taxi, he can\xe2\x80\x99t help but think about the sailor and Alice. It\xe2\x80\x99s a haunting obsession that he can\xe2\x80\x99t shake off. Bill arrives to find Nathan dead in bed and his daughter, Marion, waiting for him. Her father\xe2\x80\x99s death was a surprise and as Marion rambles on, the death of her father not quite hitting her yet, she talks about her boyfriend, Carl: they\xe2\x80\x99re going to get married soon, and leave for Michigan and out of nowhere she starts kissing him, telling Bill, she loves him. "I love you! I love you!" All the while Bill tries to convince Marion that she\xe2\x80\x99s making the wrong choice, in fact they barely know each other but she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care. Until the doorbell rings (and you see now this time it's a doorbell) This time it's Carl, Marion's boyfriend. who enters and gives his condolences and Bill takes that as an excuse to leave as Marion stays haunted by her lust. So in case you hadn't noticed Bill and Alice's relationship is mirrored by that of Carl and Marion's Where Bill is Marion's 'version', of Alice's naval officer fantasy Marion's sexual attraction to Bill is her secret that only Bill and her know As Bill walks, he can\xe2\x80\x99t stop thinking about what Alice told him: her sexual fantasy echoing in his head but as he walks he\xe2\x80\x99s approached by a prostitute named Domino. Who persuades him to come into her apartment. Where they \xe2\x80\x98negotiate the price\xe2\x80\x99 for sex, meanwhile Alice is stuck at home unaware of what\xe2\x80\x99s going on and calls Bill just before they start. (There it is again) She wants to know when he\xe2\x80\x99s coming back from visiting Marion and her dead dad and he lies to her, telling her he\xe2\x80\x99s unsure when it will end and that he\xe2\x80\x99s waiting for more relatives to arrive. After the call ends, Bill has second thoughts and leaves Domino with 150 bucks without having any sex. His walk from the apartment takes him to the Sonata Caf\xc3\xa9 where Nick the Pianist plays and they chat. We learn that Nick\xe2\x80\x99s family lives in Seattle while he\xe2\x80\x99s here working some interesting music gigs. Interesting since he plays at a new place every time never knowing until the last moment where he\xe2\x80\x99s supposed to play and with a blindfold on. Strange right? Even stranger since at the last gig he played at, the blindfold came loose and he saw some dropdead gorgeous gals and Bill's like "Wait, what are you talking about? Dude, I NEED to come to that \'party\'." As he talks, Nick writes down \xe2\x80\x98Fidelio\xe2\x80\x99, the password for his next gig, and gives him (Bill) The address and tells him to get a costume and mask since everyone is wearing one at the party. Bill goes to a costume rental outlet where an old friend runs the Rainbow Costume Rental Service, only to find out from the current owner, Mr. Milich, that his \xe2\x80\x98old friend\xe2\x80\x99 moved out and no longer owns it. After bribing Millich to get in, Milich searches for the outfit Bill wants, but both of them hear something. Milich walks into another room to find his daughter and 2 elderly men half-naked and he locks the men inside the room (threatening to call the police) as his daughter runs out. As Milich searches for the outfit, his daughter whispers into Bill\xe2\x80\x99s ear \xe2\x80\x9cYou should have a cloak lined with ermine\xe2\x80\x9d and coyly walks away, with a knowing smile. That\'s girl talk for "I think you need a nice outfit" With his costume ready, Bill takes a taxi to the address of Nick\xe2\x80\x99s next gig, still haunted by what Alice told him. He arrives to find 2 men waiting outside a gate, and gives them the password "Fidelio" when he is taken inside the mansion; where inside masked men wait and welcome guests and Bill finds himself walking in on a group of cloaked figures, standing around an inner circle of equally cloaked figures with a person in red chanting and swinging a smoking censure in the middle. The person chants eerily as Nick plays blindfolded and Bill can only watch as the inner ring of figures undress revealing themselves to be women. As this is going on, 2 people turn to stare down at Bill, nodding their heads. Before focusing on the ritual, which has changed: every time the crimson figure stamps their staff, one of the masked women stand up and choose someone from amongst the group and one of them choose Bill. The Masked Woman can tell he\xe2\x80\x99s never done this before and warns him to leave, because he\xe2\x80\x99s in danger and there might not be another chance to get away. Only for the woman to be taken away by another masked man who is part of the staff. Alone, Bill walks deeper into mansion watching partyguests engaging in all kinds of wild sex and as he stares dumbfounded the masked woman from earlier leads him away and tells him he needs to get out now! He has to leave alone because if she comes with him it could cost her: her life and maybe his and she leaves before he can unmask her. Just in time for a masked butler to come and tell Bill that his taxi cab wants a word with him. Except Bill is taken back to the room from earlier, the crimson cloaked figure, speaks in a man\xe2\x80\x99s voice, inviting him \xe2\x80\x98to come forward\xe2\x80\x99. Everyone stares at him as he walks, closing off any exits, and now the interrogation begins. The crimson man asks him for the password and Bill says it \xe2\x80\x9cFidelio\xe2\x80\x9d but then the crimson man asks Bill for the password \xe2\x80\x98for the house\xe2\x80\x99 and Bill can only lie saying \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve forgotten it\xe2\x80\x9d, there\xe2\x80\x99s an audible gasp when the partygoers hear this. He\xe2\x80\x99s asked to unmask and undress. Yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s right, get naked in front of everyone here but Bill is saved at the last moment when the Masked Woman comes to his rescue. She offers herself up in his place, in their words to \xe2\x80\x98redeem\xe2\x80\x99 him, sacrificing herself, so they set Bill free with a warning: Don\xe2\x80\x99t tell anyone about this, because there will be consequences for Bill and his family. The woman is led away and Bill can\xe2\x80\x99t help but ask what\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen to her. Nothing that concerns you, now go. Interestingly enough, this whole orgy party thing is very reminiscent of the stories about secret societies Where the rich and powerful get together and hangout, throwing wild sex parties or indulge in occult rituals Back home, As Bill, lays down in bed, Alice is sleep-laughing when she\xe2\x80\x99s woken up by Bill and tells him about her dream. In her dream, they were in a deserted city, naked and afraid, and she was angry at Bill thinking it was his fault that they were here who in the dream ran away to find their clothes. But as soon as Bill ran away, the nightmare changed with Alice laying naked in the middle of the woods visited by the naval officer who only came to laugh and look at her. She stops herself; But Bill knows that\xe2\x80\x99s not the end of the dream and asks her how it ended and she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to do it. In her words it was awful; its only after hugging him that she tells Bill that the officer made love to her and then suddenly there was a crowd of people around them, all of them having an orgy, and having sex with Alice, laughing at Bill. In her dream. But was it only a dream? Alice\xe2\x80\x99s dream is eerily similar to what happened at the party. But what exactly does this mean? Is Alice just guilty over her confessed sexual desires? Was she at the party? Or is this coincidence, karma striking back at Bill through Alice's dream? Keep this in mind, this will come into play later Back to the movie. The next day Bill manages to find out where Nick is staying. But when he gets there, Bill is told Nick checked out at 5 and didn\xe2\x80\x99t even leave a forwarding address. That\xe2\x80\x99s strange, was Nick acting weird when he checked out? and the receptionist confides with Bill that Nick came in at 4:30 with 2 burly dudes, and Nick had a bruised cheek and he was terrified. Nick went up to his room with one of the guys while the other guy stayed downstairs and paid the bill. But when Nick came down he tried to pass the receptionist an envelope except it was taken by the men and together they drove off without a trace. Bill goes back to the costume shop and returns everything but the mask. Huh, must've lost it, just put it on the bill and just as Milich calculates the bill, his daughter comes in and the two guys from the night before are also there. Mr. Milich, weren\xe2\x80\x99t you going to call the police on these men? Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ve come to a different agreement and if you ever need anything Mr. Doctor\xe2\x80\x93 anything at all \xe2\x80\x93 come back again. at work can\xe2\x80\x99t help but reflect on Alice and the sailor. As well as the party, he needs to know what happened last night, and cancels all appointments for the afternoon as he heads back to the mansion. As he approaches the gates, the security camera watches him, and a car drives up and its driver comes out. Handing Bill an envelope with a letter that warns him to back off from trying to find out about last night and the orgy-cult. May this be the last warning, Bill needs. Bill decides to visit the prostitute from earlier, Domino but when he rings her doorbell, she\xe2\x80\x99s gone and only her roommate, Sally, is there. Who invites him in. Inside, he asks Sally the roommate when Domi no will be back and her answer is: she might not be back. Sally reveals that Domino tested positive for HIV+. and after a moment, Bill takes that as his cue to leave. As he\xe2\x80\x99s walking, a suspicious man follows him, and Bill checks several times to see if this guy\xe2\x80\x99s following him, stopping to buy a newspaper and keep his eye on his stalker. The guy following is particular to stop below a lamppost, staring directly at Bill before finally walking away without a word. Thoroughly spooked, Bill walks into a coffee shop where he reads the newspaper to find a shocking headline: ex-beauty queen hospitalized. The beauty queen in question? Amanda Curran, a.k.a. Mandy from the Christmas Party who almost overdosed to death. Bill goes to the hospital where\xe2\x80\x99s she\xe2\x80\x99s hospitalized only to find out that Amanda died earlier. He can\xe2\x80\x99t believe it and goes to the morgue to see her body and he remembers what the masked woman told him at the orgy: It would cost me, my life and maybe yours. In case it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t clear: Bill believes that the Masked Woman at the Mansion party is Amanda Curran. This would explain why the Masked Woman saved Bill's Life Amanda felt indebted to Bill after he saved her life at the Christmas Party. But they are not identical in body, so who is she? We're gonna find out who she is real son As Bill leaves the hospital, he's called over to visit Ziegler for a little chat Because Ziegler's not happy with Bill: he was there at the mansion 'that night' and since then, Bill has gotten a lot of people in trouble with his investigation into NIck So you might be wondering how does Ziegler know this? Ziegler had Bill followed Then Ziegler starts answering Bill's questions Where did Nick go? He's probably on a plane back to Seattle to go to his family What about the bruises on his face? It was a light punishment Who were those people at the party? Powerful people that could get Bill into a lot of trouble How did they know Bill was there? For 1, they tricked Bill into believing that there was a second password Secondly, he arrived in a taxi cab when everyone else rode in limos Well what about the woman who saved Bill? Ziegler then suggests that maybe that "sacrifice-redemption thing" Was all a charade to scare Bill into silence and to stop him talking about the cult That's when Bill asks about Amanda. He asks Ziegler if Amanda was the Masked Woman at the party Yes, Bill. She was In that case, if it's all 'fake', how does someone die from a 'fake party'? And Ziegler is very frank with him: She was a hooker. She was used by a bunch of guys that night, and when she got home, she overdosed It was a matter of time! You know how hookers are! Ziegler tries to reassure Bill, telling him that no one killed anyone Someone just died. Life goes on! But Bill isn't comforted by his words but he accepts them An exhausted Bill returns home to find his mask that he lost at the party laying on his pillow with Alice asleep next to it and Bill breaks down. Waking Alice up and repeating to her \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll tell her everything\xe2\x80\x9d. We then see Alice smoking, her eyes bloodshot from crying, and Bill sitting on the couch equally distraught. Having talked the whole night through, and in the early hours of morning, Alice tells Bill that they have to go Christmas shopping with their daughter. While shopping, Bill asks Alice what they should do and the only thing she can think of is to be grateful! That they\xe2\x80\x99ve been through so much, surviving both their dreams and the real world. And although Alice isn\xe2\x80\x99t sure but she knows this: sometimes the only thing that\xe2\x80\x99s real is the small part of the big picture that you see: Your life; and that\xe2\x80\x99s okay, they\xe2\x80\x99re both \xe2\x80\x98awake' able to talk about their feelings, still in love, and able to move on. But Bill isn't sure. Was it really only a dream? So you\xe2\x80\x99re probably really confused right? First off: That\xe2\x80\x99s kind of the point This movie uses masks, secrets, lies, and general surreality. The heart of this movie is all about how hiding secrets can have ugly consequences At the end of the movie, Alice and Bill finally come clean and it's only then that their relationship improves Because they're perfectly honest with each other; because they wake up from their dream So a lot of strange things happen to Bill, that night, while he is walking Like he's approached by a prostitute. That's totally possible right? But super unlikely. But the same night he goes to an orgy? Totally possible, again. But also super unlikely It's like this movie has no cuts between the 'dream' and the 'reality' It's like when you wake up and you think to yourself "Wait, was I dreaming or was that real?" and this movie captures this feeling perfectly So if you remember: Alice has a dream about an orgy and it's unclear, at this point, if Alice was at the sex party But my understanding is that she was having a dream and her dream was merely coincidental It was out of this guilt over her confessed sexual desires, and her sexual frustration With Bill And that brings me to my next point: Ziegler I believe he's lying since he cares too much about his own social standing Rather than the truth So I believe that Nick was killed Why? Because he revealed the existence of the group to an outsider, Bill. And he was punished by being killed Which brings me to my next point: Amanda This movie tries to trick you into believing that Amanda was the Masked Woman But she's not. It's obvious, physically speaking, it's different. and I know for a fact that the actress for the Masked Woman and Amanda is different So it was just an attempt to confuse you and the identity of the Masked Woman, stays a mystery So one last thing: There is no evidence, officially, that 20 minutes was removed from this film Even Katharine Kubrick, Stanley Kubrick's daughter, says the movie was finished So from my research, from what I found: Is that there is no evidence that 20 minutes was cut from the movie That's what I found. That's what I think. But what do you think? What do you think is happening in this movie? Whatever you think, leave your comments down below.
