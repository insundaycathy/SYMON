If a meteor filled with giant, armored, sound-seeking predators landed in your neighborhood, what would you do? In this How to Beat video, we\xe2\x80\x99ll follow the Abbotts, see if we can make better decisions, and ultimately attempt to beat the Death Angels for the second time in, A Quiet Place 2. If you think you could do better, leave a comment letting me know how. If you enjoy watching me berate the townsfolk for running down the street screaming while under attack by aliens, go ahead and hit those like and subscribe buttons. We start out following Lee Abbott getting some oranges for the ballgame the day the apocalypse started. When Lee\xe2\x80\x99s son gets up to bat, a giant meteor starts plowing through Earth\xe2\x80\x99s atmosphere.This must have been what the dinosaurs felt like watching their impending doom descend from the heavens. The Abbotts race home, which is about the best thing you could do without any information. The meteor impact could send shock waves, earthquakes and walls of fire your way. They need to hide under a table in their basement with some snacks until the initial effects blow through, or they\xe2\x80\x99re vaporized and their dust is violently ejected into outer space. Before Lee can make it to his truck, all hell breaks loose. John panic signs to his deaf daughter that shit hit the fan and they need to get the hell out of there. Evelyn gets attacked and pulls a high speed reverse 180 into a light pole to get away from the monster. Regan sees the crash and runs out into the street after her. Luckily, she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get targeted by the monsters because all the panicky screamers are running cover. Lee grabs her and they dive into a restaurant where tons of other people are holding out. They need to find another hiding spot pronto. One of these dipshits is going to start crying, loudly praying to their God, or calling their family. How ironic. A mother\xe2\x80\x99s call to check on her daughter was what got her killed. Lee and Regan run for someplace that isn\xe2\x80\x99t being attacked by giant aliens. They get tailed by one of them, but before they get pimp-smacked across the street the town cop hits it with the pump. Someone had to learn the hard way that guns don\xe2\x80\x99t work well. The beginning of any apocalypse is the most crucial time. You need to observe as much as possible. These initial moments are key to figuring out what you\xe2\x80\x99re up against. Kind of like how Brad Pitt in World War Z took the time to watch how long it took for the infected to turn into zombies. Lee survived long enough to figure out that the aliens are too strong to fight, too armored to shoot, too fast to outrun, but they\xe2\x80\x99re blind and have terrible ADHD. With this knowledge he kept his family hidden in plain sight. In the end, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t enough. We fast forward 473 days to right after Lee sacrificed himself for his kids and Regan figured out that her cochlear implant can get the monsters to open up wide enough for Evelyn to pop a slug into their suck hole. The next morning they head over to their burning barn to assess the damage. Evelyn hands little Marcus the shotty so he and Regan can split up to make a sound bomb and light the fire signal while she tiptoes past the hopefully fully dead aliens to find a carriage for her newborn. Right after Evelyn headshotted the monster at the end of the first movie, they had looked at their camera monitors and saw a couple more coming towards them in a dead sprint. Regan upped the bass and Evelyn racked the shotty like she was the Doom Slayer. I\xe2\x80\x99m confused. Did they already mow these monsters down too, or did they just decide to split up for a scavenger hunt as they were being descended upon? We don\xe2\x80\x99t know what Regan saw when her dad was mauled. Maybe his head was lopped off and flew through the air, maybe it just looked bad but he only suffered a flesh wound and got knocked unconscious. Depending on what she saw, it might be worth checking a pulse. As for not burying him, totally understandable. You don\xe2\x80\x99t want your final memory of your dad to be a pile of unidentifiable meat. The remaining members of the Abbott family decide they need help and can\xe2\x80\x99t stay here any longer, so they head in the direction of the sole surviving fire signal. There\xe2\x80\x99s no warm welcome when they arrive. It is a year and a half after the meteor impacts. Looters and bandits are a danger that any group of survivors will need to defend against. I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand the tactic of loudly sprinting to get away from the noise you just made. You\xe2\x80\x99re just creating a more constant source of noise. You also have no idea which direction the monsters could be in. They could easily be running towards a monster. There have been numerous occasions where a monster has been within inches of them and wasn\xe2\x80\x99t able to detect them. A bit unrealistic given their auditory capabilities, but that\xe2\x80\x99s what the movie is saying. The better strategy is to just continue cat-walking away from the location the noise was made. If a monster does intercept you, a suggestion from my last video on A Quiet Place 1 was to bring lures that you can throw to create a secondary source of noise some distance away from you. Aimlessly running after setting off a trap is also a bad idea, because there could be more traps. So much for staying quiet. I\xe2\x80\x99m a firm proponent of running it stealth first, but always having the firepower in your backpack for when you inevitably fuck up and need to go loud. Regan and Evelyn know what\xe2\x80\x99s up. Evelyn should have had that shotgun pre-racked with a shell in the breach. You don\xe2\x80\x99t want to short-stroke it under stress and have the trigger go click when you need it to go boom. She unlocks the bear trap and gets him up and running again because nobody learned their lesson. I know it would turn this movie into a comedy, but it\xe2\x80\x99d be fucking hilarious if Marcus stepped on another bear trap with his other foot. A man intercepts them and guides them through the steel foundry and into a soundproof furnace. It\xe2\x80\x99s Emmett. He pleads that he can\xe2\x80\x99t help them and that they can\xe2\x80\x99t stay. That there\xe2\x80\x99s not enough food, water, or anything. Easy to turn away young strong adults, not so easy to turn away a helpless baby. His stopwatch beeps again after setting it when they entered the container, signaling that their oxygen is running out. Emmett hands Evelyn some hard alcohol to disinfect Marcus' leg before wrapping and splinting it. I know there\xe2\x80\x99s three feet of concrete above them and he\xe2\x80\x99s in the furnace, but maybe give him something to bite down on first. Not being able to run isn\xe2\x80\x99t too terrible in this flavor of the apocalypse. He needs to sit the next few expeditions out and make damn sure his leg doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get infected or he\xe2\x80\x99s going to suffer a slow painful death. Regan tries to soothe Marcus\xe2\x80\x99s pain with some easy-listening from her boombox. Which is a total misuse of the limited power they have. The speaker is the only reason they are alive. Without it, the shotgun is near-useless and they are as good as dead. Emmett asks Evelyn how the speaker works. She says she has no clue. It might be a good idea to start figuring it out and finding a way to broadcast what\xe2\x80\x99s essentially the only reliable strategy survivors can use to fight back. The radio starts playing a song called Beyond the Sea, a clear indication there are other survivors. Emmett says he\xe2\x80\x99s heard it before, but isn\xe2\x80\x99t interested in saving whoever is left alive. Not after the atrocities he\xe2\x80\x99s seen survivors commit on one another. In fact, he says he wants them gone the next morning. Dude, can you atleast give Marcus a day\xe2\x80\x99s rest after he stepped on your bear trap? And if you didn\xe2\x80\x99t want company why did you light the fire signal. Regan pulls Marcus into the furnace to tell him her grand plan. She thinks that the song is a signal directing them to the islands off the coast. It\xe2\x80\x99d be a one day walk and she could follow the railroad tracks to it. She\xe2\x80\x99s planning on going alone since Marcus can\xe2\x80\x99t walk and Evelyn needs to monitor his wounds and take care of the baby. This is a mistake. The song could very well be leading her into a trap, she\xe2\x80\x99s not capable enough to use the shotgun effectively, and she\xe2\x80\x99s deaf so she won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to hear monsters or scavs sneaking up on her. There\xe2\x80\x99s no reason to rush into this. Evelyn should be able to convince Emmett to let them stay until Marcus heals up well enough to walk, or they could go home and Marcus could heal up there. Then, they could all leave for the coast together since there isn\xe2\x80\x99t anything for them at the foundry. Evelyn\xe2\x80\x99s good with the shotgun, Regan\xe2\x80\x99s good with the implant boombox, and Marcus can watch their backs or something. Emmett could also be convinced to join. There\xe2\x80\x99s legitimately nothing here for him either. He has nothing to lose at this point. Regan knows Evelyn would never allow her to go alone, and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t consider the alternative option of staying until Marcus can walk, so she sneaks out before everyone wakes up the next morning. When Evelyn finds out, she convinces Emmett to go out searching for her. Shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be too hard if Marcus let them know she was following the railroad tracks the whole way there. Regan finds a train car and pops in to take a look-see. Nothing but rotting corpses. This was a total massacre. She does find a first aid kit that will be useful for Marcus\xe2\x80\x99s leg. When she goes to grab it, what was left of the conductor slumps onto her causing her to have a mini freakout. She doesn\xe2\x80\x99t realize how loud she squeaked, nor is she able to hear the sound of the alien stalking her from the other side of the train car until it\xe2\x80\x99s right on top of her. She\xe2\x80\x99s good with the radio, not so much with the shotgun. She should have put the radio down after turning it on so she could two hand the shotgun. Still, without any training, and being too weak to properly handle that large of a gun, she was bound to miss. I\xe2\x80\x99m surprised she even got the shot off. Evelyn had kept it with an empty chamber before, and had she put the safety back on, Regan might not have been able to switch it off, load and fire it in time. People totally underestimate the skill needed to be effective with a firearm, they think you can point it in the general direction of a bad thing, pull the trigger, and whatever\xe2\x80\x99s on the smoking side of the barrel gets deleted. A long barreled shotgun at that distance is going to have a quarter size group, so there\xe2\x80\x99s not enough spread to make up for shitty accuracy. Regan\xe2\x80\x99s unable to rack the pump action in time and kisses her own ass goodbye. Yah, maybe the whole lone wolf thing wasn\xe2\x80\x99t such a good idea. They duck into the train station and he tries to tell her that he\xe2\x80\x99s taking her home. Except he forgot that she was deaf and can\xe2\x80\x99t understand a thing he\xe2\x80\x99s saying. Emmett should have brought a pencil and notepad he could use to write her messages. A notepad should be standard equipment. It\xe2\x80\x99s such a good way to communicate silently, with deaf people, and over distances. It\xe2\x80\x99s pretty obvious that he\xe2\x80\x99s here to take her back though. Regan convinces him to help her bring the radio gun to the islands. Honestly, you guys are already pretty far down the road. You might as well go all the way. Once you get there, you can use their radio to let Evelyn know you made it so she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a meltdown and do something stupid. Emmett and Regan wait until the next morning to head for the coast. It\xe2\x80\x99s a good idea to only travel during daylight. You\xe2\x80\x99re much less likely to step on a tree branch or trip on something and make noise, and other wildlife will be active which will provide some distraction. Meanwhile, Evelyn heads back home to gather the medical supplies necessary to treat Marcus\xe2\x80\x99s wounds, which she should have brought with her or picked up along the way in the first place. She also finds two spare compressed air tanks in the back. How lucky and convenient. Marcus is left to tend to the baby. Compressed oxygen is hard to come by, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t get why they\xe2\x80\x99re wasting it when the baby isn\xe2\x80\x99t crying and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need to be in the enclosed basket. Like Emmett said, there is 3 feet of concrete above them which will muffle most noises. Which doesn't matter at all if you\xe2\x80\x99re an idiot that decides to go explore the foundry at night with an injured leg while your baby is left alone in the basement. What the fuck is this kid thinking? Bro, you just walked past 10 hanging corpses. Why are you all the sudden getting uncontrollably freaked out by dead bodies? If you were that much of a bitch, you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have even left the basement to begin with. Now a monster\xe2\x80\x99s on your ass. He grabs the baby and radio and shuts himself inside the air tight furnace. That\xe2\x80\x99s about the only thing he could do at this point. He does only have a few minutes of air inside it, so he\xe2\x80\x99ll need to slow his HR and breathing or siphon some of that O2 off. Bad news though, it\xe2\x80\x99s nearly empty after wasting it all earlier. And you blew through all the oxygen in the container far more rapidly by having your lighter on. Good going. You know you have limited oxygen, it\xe2\x80\x99s not necessary to see anything right now, why would you turn your lighter on. Marcus\xe2\x80\x99s dumb decisions lead to him having to choose between being slaughtered by aliens or carbon dioxide poisoning. I\xe2\x80\x99d choose carbon dioxide poisoning. You just get really light headed and sleepy, then once you pass out, you just don\xe2\x80\x99t wake up. Not a bad way to go. Marcus chooses death by alien claws, except he can\xe2\x80\x99t get the furnace unlocked with his noodle arms and starts hyperventilating, which is the worst thing you could possibly do in that situation. Evelyn should be back soon and can help. He just needs to chill so he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t suffocate before then. Evelyn hears the foundry crucible crash and immediately knows something is horribly wrong. She hurries inside, places one of her precious compressed air cans in the middle of an oil pit, fires a shot off to draw the creature into it, and a second shot to ignite the mix. Well that didn\xe2\x80\x99t work. Firstly, the shot would be louder than the ricochet, so the monster would have killed her. Second, these things rode a meteor through the flaming atmosphere and crashed into the planet. The alien will be able to seal it\xe2\x80\x99s armor up before it gets burned. The only way to put them down is to fire a projectile into their exposed fleshy innards before they can seal their armor. She should have kept the ammo and thrown some scrap metal across the foundry. The fire sets off the sprinklers which also does the trick of covering her sound while she sneaks downstairs to the furnace where her children are inevitably hiding and dying. How about shut the door behind you before yelling and shaking Marcus back to life.. I guess you\xe2\x80\x99d want some airflow for Marcus first, but the monster is right behind you and you do have a spare air tank you can hook him up to. While all this is going down, Emmett and Regan are just reaching the coast. When they get to the dock there\xe2\x80\x99s a little girl kneeling down by some fishing line. That\xe2\x80\x99s a red flag if I ever saw one. No child is going to be out at night by themselves unsupervised unless they\xe2\x80\x99re bait for a trap Emmett and Regan need to back out now if they still can. To be honest, they should have scouted this area for a while before walking in. Broadcasts to survivors in the apocalypse are always suspect. Walking in without doing some recon first is asking to become food for the local cannibals. Emmett sets his rifle down and tries to help the little girl, who then slips a noose around his neck and runs off with his gun. How did he get overpowered by a little girl, why did he let her go after she roped him. He should have immediately grabbed her and prevented her from taking her gun. Even though Regan\xe2\x80\x99s trash with the shotgun, she should have had it up and at the ready. Emmett\xe2\x80\x99s tied up in some fish net with rattling cans attached to it. If he tries to make a move, monsters will be all over him. It\xe2\x80\x99s not looking too good for Regan either. Emmett tells her to dive because he\xe2\x80\x99s about to make some noise. What was the point of the fishnet and rope if it didn\xe2\x80\x99t restrict his movement at all. The leader of the looters should have kicked Emmett into the water or outright killed him with a knife before turning his back. It\xe2\x80\x99s a no-brainer that Emmett would make a ton of noise to attract monsters which would attack the looters in a last ditch move to save himself and Regan. Jumping into the water is also a no brainer move. These things can\xe2\x80\x99t swim for shit. They are too dense, their armor is too heavy, and they can\xe2\x80\x99t use their hearing to navigate well underwater. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t make sense for the Abbotts to leave for an island because they needed to stay at the farm and grow their own food. Without food, the safety of the island means nothing. When Regan picks Emmett up in a paddle boat, he spits out her cochlear implant he snagged off the scav before shiving him. Clutch move. It would have been easy to forget about it when they were fighting for their lives. Hopefully those were just opportunists intercepting travelers and not the ones broadcasting the signal. It\xe2\x80\x99d be best to scout out the island before beaching this time, especially since you lost your guns. They stumble into a community cookout and bonfire. Which can\xe2\x80\x99t seem real after what they\xe2\x80\x99d been through. It\xe2\x80\x99s pretty crazy to me that nobody on the island was watching the coast or had any defensive measures for unwanted visitors. There was a freaking raiding party just along the docks which could have ransacked their precious island. Emmett hands the cochlear implant to the island man and tells him that if they can broadcast it\xe2\x80\x99s frequency, other survivors can tune in with their radios and use it to fight the monsters. Regan and Emmett finally get to sit down, take a deep breath, and let all the grief and sadness of their loved ones crash into them. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t last long though. When Emmett goes out for a walk on the beach, he discovers the boat that the monster was ripping into the night before. There was nothing that the islanders could have done to stop something like this from happening. Emmett does his best to warn everyone, but it\xe2\x80\x99s too late. Djimon, Regan, and Emmett hop into the caddy and haul ass to the broadcasting studio while honking. I question trying to bait the monster with your car. It\xe2\x80\x99s too risky and if you guys die, nobody will be able to set up the sound interference which means everyone is doomed anyways. Djimon gets too hung up on baiting the monster out of town and gets himself killed. I guess that\xe2\x80\x99s the danger of being in a safe zone for too long. You relax and forget what you need to do to survive. Regan and Emmett sneak past the alien and just as it catches on to them, Regan turns up the bass. Evelyn and Marcus are under siege as well, but now that they are armed with a radio tuned to Regan\xe2\x80\x99s implant\xe2\x80\x99s frequency, they can fight back. The movie ends with the tides of war changing in the humans favor. While nobody of importance was killed this time around, the Abbott\xe2\x80\x99s were sloppy. Everything from splitting up for no reason multiple times, to the deaf Regan running off on her own, Emmett not scouting the docks out first, Evelyn forgetting medication along the way, Marcus leaving the baby to explore the foundry with a injured leg by himself, to the islanders being incredibly nonchalant about watching the coast. It\xe2\x80\x99s sheer luck that none of them died. All said and done, I think we could or could not have beat the DEATH ANGELS from A QUIET PLACE PART 2 with less risk taken. Thanks for watching, and remember, if sound-seeking aliens are trying to kill you, avoid the urge to loudly run from them.
