Are you ready to unleash your wildest urges? Allegra Geller has created the ultimate escape. A parallel universe called eXistenZ. Antenna Research is running a focus group seminar, hosted by the world\xe2\x80\x99s most famed game designer: Allegra Geller, with a demo of her latest VR game \xe2\x80\x9ceXistenZ\xe2\x80\x9d. She is shot with an undetected gristle gun by the realist \xe2\x80\x9cNoel Dichter\xe2\x80\x9d. Who is gunned down by security guards. Meanwhile, the sleep security guard and marketing trainee \xe2\x80\x9cTed Pikul\xe2\x80\x9d is tasked with getting Geller out of there, safely. At a motel, Geller finds that her pod, which contains the only copy of eXistenZ, got damaged since it was ripped out while the game was downloading. There\xe2\x80\x99s only 1 thing she can do: plug into eXistenZ with another player and start troubleshooting. Pikul is not too keen on this, since he has  tomophobia, or the fear of being operated on; but agrees to do it. But first, they got to get him fitted with a bioport of his own. Off they go to get an illegal bioport installed by a black-marketeer named Gas. But he gives him a faulty one, which damages the game pod, revealing to both Pikul and Geller his plan to collect the bounty on Geller\xe2\x80\x99s head as soon as she\xe2\x80\x99s dead with a bonus added if eXistenZ is also destroyed. Pikul rivet-guns him dead before Gas can do so, and with Geller they get to a former ski lodge where they meet Kiri Vinokur, Geller\xe2\x80\x99s mentor. With Kiri\xe2\x80\x99s help, Pikul\xe2\x80\x99s pod is fixed and his bio-port is replaced. Once they enter the virtual world, Pikul has a Rational problem with their actions: Am I in control or is the game? When they meet videogame shop owner D\xe2\x80\x99Arcy Nader, Pikul speaks rudely to him and is surprised by his impoliteness. Geller then reveals that his game character is doing the action, not Pikul. Nader gives them new micro-pods, through which they enter another layer of reality. Here is where they meet Yevgeny Nourish, who claims to be their contact in the Realist underground. Nourish recommends that Pikul order the special for lunch at a Chinese restaurant near the factory. It\xe2\x80\x99s a stressful experience being in the restaurant so much in fact that Pikul pauses the game "eXistenZ is paused!" but we have our Matrix problem: for Pikul reality and the game feel the same. Leaving him very confused. Back in the restaurant, Pikul has a sudden craving for the lunch-special. Somehow, using the special\xe2\x80\x99s inedible bits, Pikul mindlessly crafts a pistol like the one used earlier, which Pikul then uses to shoot their waiter After all, it's just a game. Look, let me explain. Right now, they are in a Chinese restaurant, which is near a factory... "fish-monger place". before that, they were in a videogame shop and before THAT, they were in a ski lodge The ski lodge is reality the video game shop is Level 1 and the Chinese restaurant with the factory is Level 2 I hope you understood that, back to the movie. The game engine has some limitations: the customers around them seem to pause before going back to their meals, after Pikul sheepishly tells them it was a misunderstanding about the bill. They meet with Yevgeny Nourish after the incident, privately next to the fisheries of the mutant animals which are used for the \xe2\x80\x98nervous systems of the game pods\xe2\x80\x99 and here he reveals that the animals are also used to make parts for guns, and that Pikul and Geller should return to work as agents of the Realist underground against Cortical Systematics, who are the \xe2\x80\x9cEnemy of Reality\xe2\x80\x9d They go back to the game store, where Hugh Carlaw explains that Nadar is a spy for Cortical Systematics, and the chinese waiter Pikul shot was their actual contact to the Realist Underground basically inside men on their side., while Yevegeny Nourish is a double agent whose job is to make Pikul and Geller fail in their mission. The next day, they duo find a diseased pod and create a plan to sabotage the game pods in the factory by getting Geller infected, and using her to spread the disease. Pikul frees her after she becomes infected, by cutting her umbycord. The plan goes terribly wrong, because Geller almost bleeds to death and then Nourish comes in with a flamethrower, shooting it at the diseased pod. Which bursts, releasing deadly spores all over the factory. Geller stabs Nourish in the back with a knife and the duo find themselves pulled back to the ski lodge. But the disease of the factory\xe2\x80\x99s pod is transmitted to Geller\xe2\x80\x99s real game pod in the real world, which Pikul rightfully questions. Pikul\xe2\x80\x99s back scratching is noticed by Geller, who concludes that Kiri Vinokur gave Pikul an infected bioport to destroy eXistenZ. Geller\xe2\x80\x99s plugs in a \xe2\x80\x98disinfecting device\xe2\x80\x99 into Pikul\xe2\x80\x99s bioport. Meaning they can\xe2\x80\x99t play the game in the mean time Geller\xe2\x80\x99s game pod is dying when out of nowhere, a guerilla fighter enters the room! It\xe2\x80\x99s Carlaw! And he\xe2\x80\x99s a Realist resistance fighter! Outside, the trio witness a firefight by the Realist faction and whoever's around Carlaw has one last thing to do however: Kill the Demonness Allegra Geller, he lines up the sights but gets shot by Vinokur! Who reveals he\xe2\x80\x99s a Cortical Systems double agent! He also copied all of her game pod data while he was fixing her pod. While Vinokur is busy talking with Pikul, Geller shoots Vinokur dead with Carlaw\xe2\x80\x99s gun. Pikul confronts Geller, angry at her casual murder. Her defense is that they\xe2\x80\x99re still in the game. His: What if we\xe2\x80\x99re not? What if this isn't a game? Then a twist: Pikul is actually another assassin: a Realist planted to assassinate her. But, Geller already knew this: his little joke in the restaurant clued her in and the \xe2\x80\x98antibacteria plugin\xe2\x80\x99 that\xe2\x80\x99s in his bioport? It\xe2\x80\x99s a bomb. With Pikul dead, she cheers her victory, when a blue headset and controller appear on her arm and head. Pressing a button, she awakens next to an unharmed Pikul who, together, are sitting on a stage, along with Yevgenev Nourish, the Chinese Waiter, the Seminar Leader, Kiri Vinokur, Gas, D\xe2\x80\x99Arcy Nadar, Noel Dichter, and others encountered in the game. Yevgeny Nourish, is actually the game designer of the demo of the game, "tranCendenZ" and confides privately with his assistant that it was\xe2\x80\x98disturbing\xe2\x80\x99, with it\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98anti-game\xe2\x80\x99 undertones,  having the assassination of a game designer. Ouch. He suspects that someone amongst them must have influenced the game. Pikul and Geller along with a familiar dog approach Nourish and ask a simple question: \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you think you should suffer for all the harm you\xe2\x80\x99ve done and intend to do to the human race?\xe2\x80\x9d for \xe2\x80\x9cdeforming reality\xe2\x80\x9d. Nourish\xe2\x80\x99s assistant, Merle calls for security, but Pikul and Geller grab pistols hidden under the dog\xe2\x80\x99s false mane and shoot Merle and Nourish to death. The play-testers are frozen or have subdued reactions as Pikul and Geller leave. They find the person who played the Chinese waiter sitting down in a chair, and aim their guns at him. He pleads for his life and then asks them, uncertainly \xe2\x80\x9cif they are still in the game?\xe2\x80\x9d The movie ends framing Pikul and Geller standing together, guns pointed towards the camera.
