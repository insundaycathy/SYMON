Today's movie is about people: the society they are trapped in, the people around them, and the hardships they face. Just 2 years after the LA riots of 1992, the tension and anger between ethnic groups is still high. Our story first follows the life of young Eva Benitez: a latina growing up in Long Beach California, with all the hopes and dreams of any American. But hers is the hard knocks life: her brother was shot her father arrested when she was a child and Eva herself joined a Latino gang. 1994, Long Beach, California is a hard place to live and harder place to teach. A lesson Erin Gruwell is gonnna learn teaching English for at-risk students at Woodrow Wilson High School. A school once praised and highly integrated, now filled with tension between people. Erin is a woman with principles, a real champion of civil rights, feeling called to educate youth at risk. Its difficult to even talk with them when they split into their little groups and don\xe2\x80\x99t bother with the class. But first things first, she takes attendance to get get to know the students: Brandy Ross, Gloria Munez, Andre Bryant Ben Daniels, Sindee Ngyugen, Jamal Hill, Eva Benitez, and things go downhill: \xe2\x80\x9cEva\xe2\x80\x9d is quick to correct her name pronunciation and leaves when Jamal starts whining about the class he almost comes to blows with Andre after being called a dummy. No one swings at first but Erin\xe2\x80\x99s first day is not going well. During her break, she meets with Brian Gelford and Margaret Campbell. Gelford is welcoming though he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really care much for the problem students because they\xe2\x80\x99ll quit (like they do) and Erin will be free to teach a different class. Once they quit Cut to Eva riding bus, thinking about her life: she\xe2\x80\x99s on probation, her probation officer has forced her to go to school, and Eva points out how prison and school are like each other: the students gather up into tribes (Latinos, Blacks, Asians) and get into battles with each other. Ready to fight at a moment\xe2\x80\x99s notice, Eva notes this as she watches a black student in an orange hoodie get a bit too close to the latinos. The next day, Erin tries to teach and fails at getting their attention. So, Eva sneaks out to let in some of her buddies. When back in class, Jamal makes a ruckus by taking Gloria\xe2\x80\x99s bag and before Erin can do anything. Bam! Gunshots! It\xe2\x80\x99s going down, just like Eva said. People are running in the halls, an alarm is going off, it\xe2\x80\x99s like a prison riot, with the Latinos and the \xe2\x80\x98ghetto-ers\xe2\x80\x99 (Eva\xe2\x80\x99s words not mine) in particular going at it. Reality sinks in for Erin who back at home, locks her pearls away, when we meet Erin\xe2\x80\x99s husband, Scott, before they\xe2\x80\x99re off to have dinner with Erin\xe2\x80\x99s dad, though not before Erin makes Scott promise to not tell her dad about what happened that day. Her dad, Steve, isn\xe2\x80\x99t too thrilled with her teaching job, and is dismissive of the students at Woodrow, but after Scott jumps to her defense, Steve accepts it. It\xe2\x80\x99s night time and Eva and Sindee got plans for the night. Eva with her group, and Sindee with her crew, both go to the same convenience store. All is going well until Eva\xe2\x80\x99s crew spots the same student in an orange hoodie, who frustrated at losing an arcade game, demands a refund from the store owner. As Grant, the man in the orange hoodie,  storms out of the store, Eva's boyfriend, Paco has the perfect opportunity and attempts a drive-by shooting to kill Grant, he misses accidentally killing Sindy's boyfriend while Grant runs away. *ding* (Grant gets caught, and wrongly accused of the shooting.) As a witness, Eva must testify at court; but blood protects blood so she protects "her own people" in her testimony. The school teachers have a meeting about the shooting: bringing to Erin\xe2\x80\x99s attention of Eva\xe2\x80\x99s role as sole witness in the shooting. In class, Gruwell intercepts a racist drawing by one of her high school students and uses it to teach them about the Holocaust, comparing Adolf Hitler and the Third Reich to a gang. A confrontation happens: students vs teacher, or in a more personal way of seeing it the streets vs. the suburb girl Eva blasts out, "You don\'t know nothing." Why should I listen to you? Why are you are pretending to care? Don\xe2\x80\x99t you talk to me like you understand because you do not! After she cools down Tito brings up a question about what the Holocaust is. Erin is eager to educate her students, so she requests materials for the class though Margaret is quick to shoot down any hopes for giving them resources. Since Margaret isn\xe2\x80\x99t any help, in fact is against helping, Erin goes to Brian for help, who bites back with sarcasm: these kids don\xe2\x80\x99t care about learning, they\xe2\x80\x99re the ones making life dangerous, and the teachers have it way harder than any of the students. She walks out on him but has an idea: Back in class, she introduces The Line Game! She asks a yes/no question, you step up to the line if yes, stay away if no. At first it\xe2\x80\x99s small things: What movies you watched, what you music you listen to. It's all easy going But then it gets serious: Do you live in the ghetto? Do know someone in prison or in juvie? Ever been in Juvie? Does anyone know any dealers? Does anyone know any gangsters? Has anyone lost a friend to gang violence? More than 1 friend? More than 3? More than 4? With their final answer, she asks them to Pay their respects. It\xe2\x80\x99s eye-opening for everyone and the class ends with Erin giving them journals to write in. If they want to, they can leave it in a closet at the end of class so that Erin can read them. and on the night of the parent-teacher conference she decides to take a look at the diaries: What she finds in them are experiences like abuse, seeing friends die, parents fighting and so on, these kids took this as a chance to just get everything off their chest. Erin organizes the field trip to the Museum of Tolerance, where they learn about the Holocaust and afterwards they meet with real Holocaust survivors at the Marriot. The experience leaves everyone changed for better. In the first sophomore class of the year Erin makes her class do a "Toast for Change", allowing everyone to open up about their struggles and what they wish to change about themselves: Gloria starts off by saying she could have been a pregnant in high school like her mom, Marcus wishes to graduate even though his mom has kicked him out of the house and Alejandro recounts an entry from his diary about the his miserable life that even though his mom is dead, his father is without a job, and he could easily become homeless; even then he is supported by friends, and his teacher who have all together given him hope. Whether on the bus, on a bench, at school or at home, the class reads the diary of Anne Frank, transfixed on the experiences of the girl. Eva, in particular, connects deeply with Anne Frank, becoming totally gripped by story but ultimately feels betrayed by Erin: the \xe2\x80\x98hero\xe2\x80\x99 dies and the bad guys win, what the hell does that say for Eva or anyone else? That they\xe2\x80\x99ll die and fail to be anything? Marcus is quick to defend Erin and Anne Frank: Anne isn\xe2\x80\x99t dead, her story lives on and is proof that they too can survive. Marcus did some research on Anne Frank which gives Erin an idea: try to get Miep Gies, the woman who helped protect Anne Frank and her family, to come to the school! The class are excited and are so keen on the idea that they make a group fund to pay for Miep Gies\xe2\x80\x99s ticket by holding a fair and a concert. Much to Margaret\xe2\x80\x99s frustration, In the library, Miep Gies tells her experience when she helped Anne Frank, her family, and the Van Pels hide from the Nazis; when Marcus tells her that She is his hero, she rebuffs him, she was just doing the right thing, anyone especially the students can be and are heroes and that they "within their own small ways, can turn on a small light in a dark room." These two events inspire Eva to break free of the demands of her father "to always protect her own" rather than tell the truth. This also gives Marcus the courage to go back to his mom who, thankfully, takes him back. At Grant's trial, Eva shocks the courtroom "Paco did it." by revealing that Paco actually killed Sindy's boyfriend in the store; Grant is spared of being convicted and Eva is attacked and threatened but ultimately spared by members of her gang and ends up going to live with her aunt in order to keep herself safe. But the joy ends that night when Erin\xe2\x80\x99s husband, Scott, divorces her. In the final days of the sophomore class, the class realize that Erin will not be teaching the junior's class. But the students are taken aback. That\xe2\x80\x99s a dumb rule, she totally can teach them! Ben suggests that Erin fights for her right teach juniors and seniors which the rest of the class agree with. So the decision is put forward to the board, though Brian and Margaret are very against his Meanwhile, Erin asks her students to write their diaries in book form. She compiles the entries and names it The Freedom Writers Diary. In tribute to the \'Freedom Riders", a group of civil activists. Erin fights this decision, eventually convincing the superintendent to permit her to teach her kids' junior and senior year, much to their joy. The film ends with a note that Erin successfully prepared numerous high school students to graduate high school and attend college. For many, they were the first in their families to do so.
