If a highly intelligent, parasitic pathogen began infecting and reconstituting your friends into meat monsters, what would you do? In this video on Nerd Explains, we\xe2\x80\x99ll follow the characters, see if we can make better decisions, and ultimately attempt to beat the thing in, The Thing. If you think you have a better way to beat the alien pathogen, let me know in the comments! If you like these how to beat videos, consider subscribing. We start out following a Norwegion research team in Antarctica, chasing down an unusual radio signal emitting from under the ice. * It\xe2\x80\x99s not exactly an Independence Day signal.. * ...Which would warrant a Def-Con Level 1 response, but radiowaves don\xe2\x80\x99t originate from ice, so the origin of the signal is worth checking out. Once on top of the signal, their snowcat breaks through the ice and they drop into a giant chasm. With incredible luck they aren\xe2\x80\x99t killed, they crank on the headlights, revealing what appears to be a spacecraft. * I\xe2\x80\x99m guessing this spaceship didn\xe2\x80\x99t crash recently, as the ice was frozen back over, and it\xe2\x80\x99s unlikely that nobody detected it hitting the Earth. Since this craft crashed and froze awhile ago, I see no need to hunt it down in the winter. It sounds stupid to say winter in Antarctica, but the summer is actually significantly warmer and more survivable. Winter can get down to negative double or triple digits, while summer can get up to around 0 degrees. In the winter of 1982 in Antarctica, the temperatures were recorded as reaching as low as -117 degrees. * Unless they packed 3 sets of ice picks, ascending 100 to 200 feet of shear ice ain\xe2\x80\x99t gonna happen. Even if they did, they would only have limited equipment and shelter as the truck with all the gear is in the chasm. Unless their research facility and team members are close by, they\xe2\x80\x99re probably dead. Our main protagonist, Kate Lloyd, is in a different chasm, investigating the remains of a thawing 27,500 year old cave bear. She\xe2\x80\x99s a vertebrate paleontologist who's about to get an up close encounter with the thing the Norwegion\xe2\x80\x99s found. The team makes haste and takes a chopper to the crash site, where we get some not so subtle foreshadowing. Kate Lloyd is warned by other members of the team that they need to wrap up their expedition in a few days, as a nasty storm is moving in. * Storms in Antarctica aren\xe2\x80\x99t that frequent, but when they do hit, they can be really bad. The storms can cause white-out conditions with visibility of less than 3 feet for days at a time. They are avoidable though. If the expedition was postponed a week until after the storm, they\xe2\x80\x99d likely have a whole month before the next one came, and it\xe2\x80\x99d be safer working conditions for an excavation. Like we talked about earlier, this craft and specimen has been there for a long time already, so it\xe2\x80\x99s not like waiting a few days later will hurt. Using the Spryte, the crew makes their way to the site of the spacecraft. * Once inside, we get a look at the spacecraft, it\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely massive. They estimate the craft has been there for 100,000 years. * Wait what. * It\xe2\x80\x99s possible that the alien in the ship picked up our radio waves, and, realizing it could finally signal to an intelligent species for help, activated it\xe2\x80\x99s distress signal. * As far as how the alien survived for 100,00 years inside the spaceship trapped in ice. It was probably cryonically preserved, and only awakened once the ship picked up our distinct electromagnetic waves. The research crew is then taken to the alien specimen, which had attempted to escape on foot. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t make it very far though. * Remember, temperatures can drop down to -120 degrees here, which begs the question. Why did the alien leave the ship, when it\xe2\x80\x99s certain death? * This alien\xe2\x80\x99s pretty big and has claws, it looks reptilian almost. Sure, it\xe2\x80\x99s encased in ice, but maybe we should bring in some firepower for security sake. Maybe I watch too many movies.. The crew begins planning the alien excavation. * Holy shit it\xe2\x80\x99s Tormund, I thought the Wildlings were in the North. Dr. Sander explicitly commands the crew to stay off the radio, to avoid any information getting out. * I was just beginning to wonder why nobody was alerting the authorities. Sure, I get that they want to make the discovery and intimately be a part of researching the alien, which you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t get to do if the Government started intervening. But, they are paleontologists, ecologists, and geologists, dealing with an alien spaceship and body. I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say, they\xe2\x80\x99re out of their depth. * If they had divulged their discovery to organizations that had the equipment knowledge, and capabilities for securing and containing a potential alien lifeform, this whole mess could have been avoided. As we\xe2\x80\x99ll see soon, this crew makes a ton of foolish mistakes which leads to the thing getting free. It is reasonable that scientists would selfishly want to take a first stab at checking out an alien ship, so let\xe2\x80\x99s continue as if we decided not to get outside help. * We get to meet the rest of the team, and it appears the first three gentlemen did survive the drop into the chasm. Another researcher, Adam, has the same perplexing question I do: * The only reasonable answer, is that this thing must be really dumb.. The next day they haul the ice block containing the alien into camp. * It seems like an obvious precaution to take when dealing with a thawing alien creature is to wear level A personal protective equipment, which should be worn when skin, respiratory, and eye protection is required. I would think that dealing with an alien, whose body will no doubt contain alien microbes, would warrant this level of protection. * There have been numerous cases of people picking up pathogens from old thawing objects and creatures. Not too long ago, there was an anthrax outbreak caused by old thawing reindeer corpses, as well as an archaeologist that picked up a skin infection from handling an old polar bear skull without protection. Always use protection when fondling old polar bear skulls, you never know where that head\xe2\x80\x99s been. * It\xe2\x80\x99s pretty common sense stuff, especially when dealing with a fucking alien. * Since this thing is an alien, we don\xe2\x80\x99t know it\xe2\x80\x99s capabilities at all. It could be a cyborg, it could have a life support suit, it might not be killed easily by cold conditions, it could be super strong. There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of unknowns, so just assuming this alien is dead and throwing it in the shed is just a little too careless, to put it lightly. * They\xe2\x80\x99ve already made a few major mistakes so far. Attempting to research an alien spacecraft and creature without letting anyone know, and doing so without any protective equipment, secure containment facilities, or weapons. At least Kate has some brains. The crew proceeds to not give a single shit, whips out a power drill you\xe2\x80\x99d pick off the rack at Lowes, and drills into the alien. After studying the alien\xe2\x80\x99s tissue sample, Dr. Sander announces that he has never seen anything like it on a cellular level. It\xe2\x80\x99s a monumental discovery for mankind. * Which is why they\xe2\x80\x99ve taken care to secure the alien corpse in a melting block of ice in a wooden storage shed. * I know all safety has been thrown out the window, but for science\xe2\x80\x99s sake, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you want to keep the ice from melting prematurely as decomposition would set in and destroy the alien corpse? Ah, that\xe2\x80\x99s why. The most important scientific discovery of the millennium is being safeguarded by a bunch of drunken buffoons. Another crew member decides to check out the unsecured alien that\xe2\x80\x99s kept in the storage shed, while everyone\xe2\x80\x99s plastered. Welp, I think containment was breached. Great, now there\xe2\x80\x99s a Xenomorph on the loose and everyone is hammered. Derek breaks the news, and they all don their winter coats and split up to search for it with nothing but flashlights. * Good idea guys, don\xe2\x80\x99t wait until morning, don\xe2\x80\x99t stay together, and don\xe2\x80\x99t get anything that can be used to defend yourselves. It\xe2\x80\x99s not like this giant Xenomorph looking alien just superman\xe2\x80\x99ed out of a block of ice and through the roof of the shed or anything. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure search groups of 2 or 3 people at night will be sufficient. * Understatement of the year. * Personally, I\xe2\x80\x99d grab gear and weapons, then move everyone together to the most secure, well-built part of the camp to hold out. Like before, the alien won\xe2\x80\x99t survive the freezing conditions so it can\xe2\x80\x99t leave the camp. It will hide somewhere in the camp, but trying to catch it is too dangerous. * Then I'd make contact with the U.S. that we discovered an alien craft and survivor. Help should arrive within a day or so to properly secure and contain the alien. * I\xe2\x80\x99m betting they wait until the storm hits, then try to radio home for help, at which point it will be broken and rescue is impossible. * If for some reason you do want to catch it, wait until morning when visibility isn\xe2\x80\x99t a problem. I\xe2\x80\x99d put 2 people with a radio in the water tower like Private Jackson &amp; Parker in Saving Private Ryan, so they could coordinate the ground teams and watch for the alien. * Then have the rest of the crew grab flamethrowers and weapons, and sweep through the compound, clearing it room by room together. Maintain visual contact with each other as best as you can. This alien was frozen, drilled into, and is probably a bit agitated. You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to barbecue it, but if it gets rowdy you\xe2\x80\x99ll have options. Take care to maintain open lines of fire by using an L shaped formation. If you surround the alien, using the flamethrower becomes dangerous as you\xe2\x80\x99re likely to hit your friends. Looks like the alien was hungry, but it\xe2\x80\x99s still nowhere to be found. We cut over to two unnamed and expendable researchers, completely isolated and in darkness, hunting for a pissed off alien. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure they\xe2\x80\x99ll be just fine. The other guy doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need to radio for help, as his screaming at the sight of his friend being sucked into an alien\xe2\x80\x99s belly will do. Who could have foreseen that the alien would completely outmatch and attack them. The rest of the crew shows up to help watch their friend get consumed. To Dr. Sander\xe2\x80\x99s dismay, they open fire on the alien with pistols. The alien shrugs off their puny calibers, so they toss over a can of kerosene and light it up with a superbly placed flare. * Honestly, that throw was on point. I\xe2\x80\x99d have missed and bounced the flare off the side of the shed. Kudos as well for not trying to shoot the kerosene, we all know that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work. Fire-bombing the alien seemed to do the trick. Back at the lodge, there\xe2\x80\x99s a standoff between Dr. Sander and Sam Carter, the chopper pilot and expert flare thrower, as to what to do with the body. Sanders wants to perform an autopsy, and Carter wants to completely destroy it. * We know it\xe2\x80\x99s the thing, but they don\xe2\x80\x99t. I personally would choose to autopsy it in the name of science. * But with one minor condition. That the autopsy isn\xe2\x80\x99t performed by us, but by another agency that\xe2\x80\x99s more well-equipped and has the firepower and intelligence to contain it. It should be painfully obvious that we aren\xe2\x80\x99t able to handle the situation. Until they could arrive, I\xe2\x80\x99d just guard the alien body with flamethrowers. * The crew quickly begins autopsying the alien corpse, under the assumption that it\xe2\x80\x99ll start decomposing, I guess. But bodies at the morgue are kept at low negative temperatures in order to significantly slow rates of decomposition until an autopsy can occur. If you leave the alien corpse outside in Antarctica, the temperatures are more than adequate for storing it until another agency arrives. * It looks like the giant bug alien was only able to devour half of Henrik. * But good god, this has to be the most horrific autopsy you could be asked to do. I\xe2\x80\x99d be hopping on Sam\xe2\x80\x99s chopper to get out of this shitshow as soon as possible. This arrogant scientist and his lackeys are definitely gonna get themselves killed. * Jesus Christ, he\xe2\x80\x99s literally performing an autopsy without any PPE on his face. It\xe2\x80\x99s fairly common for bodily juices to squirt out of corpses when performing autopsies, which is why they wear facemasks. Everyone else in the room is literally breathing alien corpse air into their lungs. * Also, they\xe2\x80\x99re wearing the same gloves that sandwich artists at Subway use, which obviously aren\xe2\x80\x99t meant for open alien surgery. I know I'm hammering on using PPE a lot, but as the saying goes, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. * It\xe2\x80\x99s worth noting that the creature survived being frozen without a protective suit, and we know it\xe2\x80\x99s not a cyborg of any sort. Most organisms can\xe2\x80\x99t survive rapid freezing as it causes intracellular ice crystallization which destroys the cells. This means that the alien shares properties of known extremophile organisms called Psychrophiles, which can survive and reproduce at near 0 degree temperatures. * I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure why he said their friend was encased in some type of amniotic sac, the alien was not exactly giving birth to Henrik, quite the opposite actually. Kate pulls out a loose piece of metal used to reinforce broken bones. The fact that it was just loosely floating around in there is a bit odd. Kate and Adam use a microscope to study a blood and tissue sample of the alien, which reveals the nature of the thing. * I\xe2\x80\x99m sure Dr. Sanders would find this fascinating, and it is. But it\xe2\x80\x99s also clearly an incredibly dangerous pathogen that needs to be handled with immense care. * Nobody has used PPE, the alien in the autopsy room is still alive on a cellular level, and one of the crew members was splattered in the face with blood. With how infectious and dangerous this pathogen is, it cannot be allowed to leave the station. Containment needs to be ensured. * This would be a breach in containment. He needs to be quarantined along with the alien. He hasn\xe2\x80\x99t suffered any mortal wounds, only minor shock. So he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need to travel to a hospital. While washing her hands in the bathroom, Kate notices what look like metal fillings on the ground. * Please don\xe2\x80\x99t pick it up. * Oh, thank god she used a napkin to pick up the lethal pathogen. * This is the same sort of thing we saw with Henrik and his metal plate. But that occurred inside an alien which contained the imitating blood. This would only happen if this guy\xe2\x80\x99s infected with the same pathogen. * You can\xe2\x80\x99t just remove fillings without the tooth coming with it, so something is not right here. We have to stop the helicopter from leaving until we know what\xe2\x80\x99s happening. Kate\xe2\x80\x99s a clever girl, so she pieces this together and flags the chopper down before they leave. * Kate needs to get a weapon, preferably one that throws fire, and isolate the infected guy quickly. If he\xe2\x80\x99s just an imitated alien, and no longer himself, stopping the thing from leaving will provoke it to attack. The bug was made up of the same infected cells as this guy, and it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly peaceful when confronted. The bug also wasn\xe2\x80\x99t stopped by bullets. * It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t Henrik, as Kate suspected. Griggs was likely infected and assimilated by the doggo-thing. Looks like beer wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the only thing he brought back to the party. Sam can\xe2\x80\x99t put the chopper down gently amidst the chaos, and crash lands far from the base. * What do ya know, they just now try to use the radio but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work because of the impending storm. Not that help would be able to arrive in the storm if they could make contact. Kate returns to the bathroom, to assess the bloody shower, except, all the blood is gone. This thing is still here. * Can someone pistol whip this guy already. He\xe2\x80\x99s already gotten people killed, and I'm sure a whole lot more will die because of him. The crew decides to go to a nearby research station for help. But thankfully Kate stops them. She briefs the rest of the crew on her discovery from the microscopy, that this thing can replicate people. According to Kate, one of the weaknesses of the thing is that it can\xe2\x80\x99t copy inorganic material. * In the movie, the stubborn researchers disregard her warnings which leads to a lot of unnecessary death. You literally have a blood sample, and an alien corpse full of the pathogen. All you need to do is show them the blood sample under a microscope, it\xe2\x80\x99s irrefutable evidence. Once the crew is onboard with your assertions, you can begin to quarantine and destroy the thing. * Since this thing is already here and imitating people, you can\xe2\x80\x99t trust anyone without verification. It could be in this room with us right now. The fact that it assimilates organisms on a cellular level means that it\xe2\x80\x99s not only intelligent, but could possess an identical brain structure. It might be able to imitate the intelligence, memories, and behavior of it\xe2\x80\x99s victim. The only reliable way of detecting the thing is with a blood sample. * Move everyone outside, so if the thing attacks, you can torch it without burning the whole building down. Since this thing can\xe2\x80\x99t replicate inorganic material, check for fillings on a few people. Then, send those people to get blood testing kits and flamethrowers. * We know that whoever the thing is, they\xe2\x80\x99re composed of the same cells the bug was, which means they\xe2\x80\x99re indestructible to small arms. * Before rooting out the thing, which will provoke it to attack, make sure you have the flamethrowers lit. Eventually the blood tests will reveal the thing, which you can then burn to ashes. The dog-thing will need to be found and destroyed, as well as a similar procedure performed on any survivors of the helicopter crash. * Nearby stations would also need to be warned. Later in the movie, we find out that a nearby Russian station is 50 miles from them. Alaskan Malamutes, like Lars\xe2\x80\x99s dog, race in the Iditarod and can cover over 100 miles in a single day. It\xe2\x80\x99s possible that the dog-thing could reach other stations on foot. This is confirmed by the 1982 sequel. * If the crew still disregarded us like in the movie, I\xe2\x80\x99d prepare myself for the eventuality that everyone will be killed and assimilated, based on their complete lack of regard for an deadly, insidious alien pathogen. Grab gear, weapons, packaged food and bottled water, secure a radio, then isolate myself from everyone else. Once the interference clears up, let the world know that a deadly pathogen from an alien was found, and to proceed with extreme caution, etc. * Members of our crew decide to break containment and head to the nearby Halley research station to get to their other refueling chopper, but it\xe2\x80\x99s okay as they won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to leave that station until the storm passes. When the storm passes we can radio out our warning to the world, before they can take the chopper home. Juliette sides with Kate, and shows her where the snowcat keys are so she can hide them and prevent the crew from leaving the base They both hurry into the storage closet, where Kate thinks she\xe2\x80\x99s going to find the keys, but actually, Juliette wants to get her alone for a little striptease. * Kate nopes out of there with some slick parkour moves. Seriously, can we just take a moment to commend her for not tripping on a loose pencil or can of beans during her escape. Blondie doesn\xe2\x80\x99t share Kate\xe2\x80\x99s quick reactions and gets rekted before his brain can process, \xe2\x80\x9cMonster close, me, in danger.\xe2\x80\x9d Lars shows up with the flamethrower, which is good thinking since we know the alien cells and pathogens are susceptible to intense heat. * Wait, why the hell do research scientists have a flamethrower? On Quora, a first hand account answered that they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find flamethrowers in the U.S. Antarctic Program\xe2\x80\x99s material and maintenance tracking software. I know this isn\xe2\x80\x99t a U.S. station, but I think it\xe2\x80\x99s still relevant. I guess it\xe2\x80\x99s just because it\xe2\x80\x99s cool. Lars torches the thing, but it intelligently uses the fire sprinklers to extinguish the flames. A couple more blasts from the flamethrower helps to cook the alien through, until it drops dead. The crew takes the thing outside to a ditch, douses it in kerosene, and lights it on fire again, just to be sure it\xe2\x80\x99s fully dead. * The doubletap is a smart move, as you can never be too sure it\xe2\x80\x99s dead. While this creature is seemingly lifeless, the pathogen could have infected and assimilated anyone else in the group. * Since everybody is now taking the situation seriously, what can we do? We need to test who is a thing and who isn\xe2\x80\x99t. * Lars is the most unlikely person to be the thing, since he torched it. Keep everyone outside in the huddle further than arm's length preferably, with Lars guarding them with the flamethrower. Have Kate, the second most unlikely person to be the thing, go get enough petri dishes and sharp objects for each person in the group, as well as bring a microscope back outside to the group. Hand out the sharp objects and petri dishes to each person, with the instruction to extract a blood sample. Then have everyone return their samples back to Kate and Lars. Have Kate inspect the samples to determine who is a thing, then, well, you know what to do. They decide to split up so some of the crew can get test kits and the others can disable the vehicles. Splitting up is not a good idea, once you lose visual contact you can\xe2\x80\x99t determine if the other\xe2\x80\x99s have been assimilated. I like my idea better. Kate goes off with Lars to disable the vehicles, then he shows her a stash of incendiary grenades he\xe2\x80\x99s been hoarding. * Damn, Lars has a flamethrower and incendiary grenades. I like this guy, I\xe2\x80\x99ll take 2 or 3 please. Derek and Sam from the helicopter crash show up. * Or, we could just test their blood like we were going to do already. * It might also be a good idea for Lars to top that flamethrower off. It looks like a type of WW2 flamethrower, which typically only holds enough fuel to fire for 7-10 seconds. He probably used up most of the fuel at his first barbecue. Some of the crew members find that the lab is on fire, and all the test kits were destroyed, probably sabotaged by the thing. * Hmm, maybe Kate should have been the only one to get the kits while Lars guarded the remaining people, like in my strategy. * Great, now we are reduced to checking people\xe2\x80\x99s mouths up close with a flashlight looking for fillings. This method is trash because as soon as you realize it\xe2\x80\x99s the thing, their tongue will turn into a tentacle and suck your face into their mass of flesh. It\xe2\x80\x99s also unreliable, I mean what if someone just had great dental hygiene and didn\xe2\x80\x99t need fillings. They separate the flossers from the fillings, and send Lars to bring Derek and Carter for their dental inspection. Lars gets mauled by something while trying to find the Americans by himself. * Damnit Lars, I liked you man. Panic and distrust ensues once the group learns that Lars went missing right when the Americans escaped and showed up. Derek ends the standoff with a Mozambique triple tap. Carter and Derek are Vietnam war veterans, they don\xe2\x80\x99t fuck around in these situations. * Unfortunately, the flamethrower was destroyed in the shootout. But fortunately, Sam found another flamethrower. Where the hell is everyone getting flamethrowers from, is there an armory around or something. Edvard nearly gets blown up by the damaged flamethrower, so they take him to the rec room to continue their game of Guess Who, and well, let\xe2\x80\x99s just say it\xe2\x80\x99s not hard to guess who the thing is anymore. Of course the fucking flamethrower doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work, or, it\xe2\x80\x99s out of fuel. * If that was Lar\xe2\x80\x99s flamethrower that they stole, like we talked about earlier, it was probably out of fuel. All hell is now breaking loose. Derek pathetically attempts to kill it with more 9mm fire from his Walther P38, which has no effect, before getting whacked by the tentacle. * Honestly, knowing what we know from the first encounter, bullets have minimal effect. The best course of option is to use a flamethrower or grenade. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t have those, then just run. * It\xe2\x80\x99s also important to realize that anyone who got tentacled is now infected by the pathogen, and could start to attack you. Adam Finch\xe2\x80\x99s death is one of the more fucked up ones, with the thing fusing and assimilating him while he\xe2\x80\x99s alive. * I think Peder got off easy with the bullet to the brain. Kate gets the flamethrower working, and gets a good look at poor Tormund. It\xe2\x80\x99s not giant's milk he\xe2\x80\x99s drinking tonight. Kate mercy kills him with the flamethrower. * You know the situation is bad when getting flamethrowered is a mercy killing. She roasts Derek\xe2\x80\x99s body too. * Seriously though, that flamethrower has to be out of fuel by now. You need to either go get more fuel and those incendiary grenades, or pick another flamethrower off the flamethrower tree. Sam and Kate team up while Sanders hides like a bitch. * I never liked Sanders, because he basically caused this mess, but it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to see him go out like this. A facehugger ambushes them, but Carter cuts it in half with his fireman's axe. * Great, now there\xe2\x80\x99s two of them. They should\xe2\x80\x99ve expected that an axe wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t work on the thing, as it regularly performs a kind of mitosis and rapid cellular transformation, but what else are you gonna do? It did seem like it injured it temporarily though. Kate torches the hand centipede thing. * Good on Kate for warning Carter of picking the axe back up. It\xe2\x80\x99s not crazy to assume that the blood could form into a mini bug thing and infect him. For all we know, one virion might be all it takes to infect and assimilate a person. Kate and Sam look for Sanders-thing, and attempt to clear the base of the thing. * Clearing the base right now is exceptionally dangerous. There could be more facehuggers that could jump out at you from anywhere. The smaller ones are arguably more dangerous as they are faster, sneakier, and harder to hit. . * The big one\xe2\x80\x99s no slouch though, as all it takes is one whip from it\xe2\x80\x99s tentacle and you\xe2\x80\x99re done. The best move is probably to retreat to the grenade shed. You\xe2\x80\x99ll have more firepower to deal with the thing, the element of surprise if the thing enters the shed, and one point of entry that you can guard. * Yep, bet you\xe2\x80\x99re wishing you retreated to the grenade shed instead. Carter and Kate get separated in the chaos. Carter grabbing pots, pans, and kitchen knives to fight with is comically desperate. Getting back to Kate asap is his only chance. * I gotta say, it\xe2\x80\x99s refreshing that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t accidentally knock over some Campbells soup. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter though, he got backed into a corner. The thing spots him, but before Carter gets absorbed into the meat monstrosity, Kate comes in hot with the flamethrower. She uses up the rest of what appeared to be a bottomless supply of flame juice in a fit of rage, at least it seems like it. * It\xe2\x80\x99s pretty understandable that in that situation you\xe2\x80\x99d squeeze and hold the trigger until the thing was ashes, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a costly mistake. Sanders obviously got rekted earlier, so there is still a Sanders-thing to contend with, possibly also dog-thing and Lars-thing as well. The flamethrower is the only effective weapon they have. They spot Sanders-thing making a break for it in the snowcat. I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure how, I thought Kate and Lars disabled all the vehicles. Maybe they only unplugged the batteries, not realizing the thing\xe2\x80\x99s level of intelligence and access to memories which it can use to restart the vehicle. * I\xe2\x80\x99m with Kate. The thing likely retains the neuron structure of the victim, so the thing could retain knowledge of other research stations, like the Halley station, which has a functioning helicopter. If we let it leave, it could spread to the rest of the world. It must be stopped. Kate grabs some nades to bring along for the ride. * I love the exchange when Carter see\xe2\x80\x99s Kate stuffing nades into her jacket, and he\xe2\x80\x99s just like, aight cool, let's head out. There\xe2\x80\x99s no stupid dialogue of, \xe2\x80\x98where the hell did you get those.\xe2\x80\x99 He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t give a shit how she got them, only that they are a welcome addition. Once the two get on the road, Kate and Carter suspiciously check each other out. She sees he\xe2\x80\x99s still wearing an earring. * I\xe2\x80\x99m kind of skeptical of using this as proof he\xe2\x80\x99s not a thing. Sure, the thing can\xe2\x80\x99t replicate the ear piercing, but once formed it could pierce it\xe2\x80\x99s ear in order to blend in. Fillings make more sense, as you can\xe2\x80\x99t put a filling back in. Given the circumstances, it\xe2\x80\x99s decent reassurance though. Kate inquires about Lars\xe2\x80\x99s disappearance, but Carter says he had nothing to do with it. * I guess they judged the direction Sander\xe2\x80\x99s was going in and realized he was heading to the spacecraft, not a nearby station. This thing is trying to fire up the spacecraft, which I'm confused about. * Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t it do that earlier. * Also, virions can\xe2\x80\x99t retain the knowledge necessary to operate a spacecraft, the thing should be limited to the intelligence of the victim it\xe2\x80\x99s imitating since it replicates their brain structure, generally speaking. Whatever. * Did she just fall into the engine or something? At least the thing was dumb enough to leave the spaceships entrance open for Carter. * Do you ever find yourself in a peculiar situation, and wonder, how did I get here. What series of decisions did I make, which led me to this point. * That\xe2\x80\x99s what Carter is most likely thinking to himself, as he wanders an alien spaceship with a world war 2 flamethrower in search of a spaghetti monster. While Kate gets mesmerized by an alien hologram thing, Sander\xe2\x80\x99s, in his final form, sneaks up on her. * The thing could have detached an arm to create a facehugger, which she would have no way of fighting off. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why I'm trying to help the thing. It might make for an interesting video though. If I was the thing, how would I beat the humans? Let me know in the comments if you like that idea. Just before she gets pulled into the open by Sanders-thing, she grabs the thermite nade. * Kate misses an opportunity to drop a one-liner, like, \xe2\x80\x9cEat this\xe2\x80\x9d, after she lobs the nade into the things' suckhole. * See, that\xe2\x80\x99s how it\xe2\x80\x99s done. Carter shows up in time for the fireworks. * A bit Hollywood with the explosion, thermite nades actually just burn through things like a 5000 degree sparkler. You don\xe2\x80\x99t wanna be hand-holding this sparkler, that\xe2\x80\x99s for sure. Carter suggests going to a nearby Russian station. * It\xe2\x80\x99s kind of hard to see, but Carter\xe2\x80\x99s not wearing his earring anymore. It\xe2\x80\x99s possible he is a thing now. It could have been lost in the tussle, but we have to be extra cautious with him. I think Kate knows this too, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think she\xe2\x80\x99s subtly glancing over at him because he\xe2\x80\x99s cute. His suggestion to go to another station is suspicious too. Yep. Kate grabs the flamethrower baits him by bringing up his missing earring. When he goes to touch his ear to feel for the missing earring, he touches the wrong ear. * It seems like a clever play by Kate, but Carter should\xe2\x80\x99ve retained the memory of his earring placement. I mean, Sanders-thing remembered how to start up a fucking spaceship from memories contained within it\xe2\x80\x99s virions. * Besides the missing earring, the other thing that damns him, is that when he showed up and the thing was about to kill Kate, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t use the flamethrower on it. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t look like he saw her lob the grenade into its mouth either, so he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have an excuse to not have opened up on it. Carter-thing pleads for it\xe2\x80\x99s life in a last attempt to deceive Kate. But Kate\xe2\x80\x99s an absolute fucking savage. * Judging by the weird screaming sounds, Carter was most likely a thing. Kate hops into the spare snowcat without checking the backseat. * Come on, always check the backseat. Did we forget about facehuggers all of the sudden. The movie ends. * Kate needs to make contact with other stations to get the word out, and secure the pathogen and spaceship. * It\xe2\x80\x99s risky to go to another station in person, as we don\xe2\x80\x99t know the extent of the pathogen's abilities. We could be infected, but the pathogen might not attack and replicate the rest of our body until it\xe2\x80\x99s safer for it to do so, meaning we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be able to detect it, even with a blood sample. * We can\xe2\x80\x99t chill at the base and wait for the storm to pass before radioing out, as the Lars-thing and Dog-thing could easily kill us, or make it to another station before the storm passes. * Kate needs to go to the russian station in person, right away, so she can warn them. Obviously she\xe2\x80\x99d want to self-quarantine and fully checked out once help arrives. * If we can swing it, the most effective way to clean this mess up is to nuke the site from orbit. * But it\xe2\x80\x99s probably hard to get approval for. With Kate\xe2\x80\x99s help, the rest of the world could help establish containment and begin studying the ship. * Despite torching the things, there are probably still active cells and virions, so this place is still a hot-zone. Since it\xe2\x80\x99d be hard to convince the world to nuke the research station, trying to manually contain this pathogen could still fail and result in unimaginable amounts of death and destruction. In conclusion, I think that we could have prevented the thing\xe2\x80\x99s massacre with a bit of caution and PPE. But I also think that there were a lot of pivotal moments where the crew could\xe2\x80\x99ve made better decisions which would have stopped the thing and saved lives. What do you think? How would you have beat The Thing? Let me know in the comments. Thanks for watching. And remember, don\xe2\x80\x99t finger alien corpses with sandwich gloves.
