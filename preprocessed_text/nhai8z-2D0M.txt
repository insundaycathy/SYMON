Story Recapped here. Today, I'm going to explain an action, drama, sci-fi film called \xe2\x80\x9cI, Robot.\xe2\x80\x9d Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care. In 2035, robotics has advanced significantly to where robots are now as common as people on the streets. Though robots and humans live in cohabitation, robots still follow every human\xe2\x80\x99s command. Three robotics laws govern robots: robots shall not harm humans, robots shall obey humans, and robots shall protect themselves from harm. Detective Del Spooner is a cop who clings to the old ways. He distrusts robots and considers them nothing but tin cans that can talk. Spooner heads to work when he sees a robot running with a purse. He pursues the robot, commanding it to stop, but the robot keeps running. He finally tackles it down after chasing it, but he\xe2\x80\x99s surprised to learn the robot is just trying to bring its owner her purse that she had forgotten. Onlookers laugh at Spooner for thinking a robot could be capable of a crime. At the station, his boss, John, hears about Spooner\xe2\x80\x99s latest incident and tells him his distaste for robots is misplaced. John then asks Spooner to specify the number of robots that have ever committed a crime. Spooner sheepishly answers zero. Spooner then gets a call about a suicide incident at USR, a significant robotics company, and heads there to investigate. He finds out that renowned robotics engineer, Alfred Lanning, had fallen to his death. In a hologram message, Lanning explicitly asks Spooner to be called to the scene. Spooner stands over a lifeless Lanning, perplexed as to why he would kill himself. Spooner then meets with URS CEO Lawrence Robertson to talk about the incident. Robertson praises Lanning and mourns the loss, saying the advancement in robotics wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been possible without Lanning. He offers to help in any way he could, feeling at fault for not seeing signs or behavior that Lanning may have shown that would have indicated suicidal thoughts. Spooner then makes an insulting remark, antagonizing the company. Spooner and Robertson then depart, clearly in bitter terms. At an elevator, robot psychologist Susan Calvin accompanies Spooner into the robotic labs. Spooner asks Calvin if she noticed strange behavior indicative of Lanning being suicidal, and Calvin answers no. Spooner asks for surveillance footage, and Calvin shows him surveillance strips dotted throughout the building. This connects to the building\xe2\x80\x99s central operating core, the Virtual Interactive Kinetic Intelligence, or Viki for short. Calvin says that Viki is Lanning\xe2\x80\x99s first creation, and it has designed most of the city\xe2\x80\x99s security systems. Spooner asks Viki for footage of the laboratory where Lanning fell, but the footage has been corrupted. They then enter the laboratory and look for more clues. Lanning\xe2\x80\x99s lab is filled with different robotic parts and experimental models. Spooner tries smashing the window and notes that an elderly Lanning wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have had sufficient strength to break through the window. Spooner looks through the mess of robotic parts and uncovers an NS-5 robot, the company\xe2\x80\x99s newest model set to be released soon. The robot suddenly jumps out, scaring Spooner and Calvin. Calvin tells Spooner to calm down as the robot is incapable of harming them. Spooner keeps his gun pointed at the NS-5, and it grabs the gun out of Calvin\xe2\x80\x99s hand. It tries to escape, but Viki closes the door. The NS-5 then jumps out through the window and sprints away. Spooner and Calvin follow, ending up at a robotics factory. Spooner looks through the hundreds of robots at the factory and sees one of the robots peaking at him, and he chases after it. Spooner and Calvin weave through the robots until the NS-5 throws Spooner to the ground. The robot then walks up to him and asks him the nature of its existence. It then escapes, but the police quickly corner it and capture it. At the station, Spooner maintains his notion that the robot could be responsible for Lanning\xe2\x80\x99s death. Spooner asks if he can have five minutes with the robot to ask a few questions, and John reluctantly agrees. Spooner asks the robot why it had murdered Lanning, and the robot answers it didn\xe2\x80\x99t; it was simply hiding in the lab, in fear. Spooner says robots don\xe2\x80\x99t have emotions and therefore cannot feel frightened. The NS-5 answers that it does and says it has even experienced dreams. Spooner says that\xe2\x80\x99s not possible, as robots are a mere imitation of life. He then tells the NS-5 that he theorizes Lanning may have tried programming emotions into it, but something went wrong, and the robot ended up killing Lanning. The robot repeats that it didn\xe2\x80\x99t murder Lanning, smashing its fists into the table in anger. It then tells Spooner that Lanning named it Sonny. Sonny says that it didn\xe2\x80\x99t know why Lanning would want to kill himself. In the days leading up to Lanning\xe2\x80\x99s death, the robot says that it noticed Lanning had become scared. It then tells Spooner that Lanning had asked it a favor. Sonny says that it obeyed Lanning\xe2\x80\x99s order out of love for him. Robertson arrives and defends the company, saying robots are incapable of murder. The three laws wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t allow for it to happen, and he adds that the definition of murder is a person killing another person. He says the police can\xe2\x80\x99t charge the robot for murder, and this whole incident would have to be classified as an industrial accident. He then orders the immediate removal and decommissioning of Sonny. Spooner is unsatisfied with the investigation\xe2\x80\x99s findings and thinks there\xe2\x80\x99s more to the case. He remembers what Sonny had said about Lanning being scared and heads to Lanning\xe2\x80\x99s abandoned estate. There, he finds a demolition robot set to destroy the home the following day. He enters the house and finds the same surveillance strips in USR, also in Lanning\xe2\x80\x99s home. On his way out, he sees the demolition robot has turned itself on. The robot smashes through the wall, and Spooner runs for his life. He barely makes it out of the house, but he escapes through the door, diving into a pool of water. He later arrives at Calvin\xe2\x80\x99s home and tells her what happened. Spooner says that Lanning\xe2\x80\x99s home appeared as if he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been home in weeks. He theorizes that someone may have kept watch on Lanning, maybe even keeping him prisoner in his lab. Spooner suspects that Lanning may have discovered a problem with the robots, and Robertson silenced him. Spooner maintains that USR is trying to cover something up. Calvin thinks Spooner is wrong and attributes his paranoia to a distrust of robots in general. She says he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care about Lanning\xe2\x80\x99s death, and he just wants robots to be evil. Spooner counters by saying robots are cold, calculating, and soulless, and humans shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t trust them. Calvin then says robots are safe, programmable, and predictable, and unlike humans, they would never harm anyone. The next day, Spooner sees hordes of NS-5s being released onto the streets, replacing the NS-4s. The NS-5s are more sophisticated, better designed, and now have an uplink direct to Viki. People are happy and cheer at the arrival of the new robots. Spooner reviews old recordings of Lanning at his desk, where he hears him say that robots in the future would have dreams and secrets. At USR, Calvin prepares Sonny for decommissioning. Sonny wakes up and tells her it had been dreaming. Calvin tells Sonny he\xe2\x80\x99ll be decommissioned the following day, and Sonny says he would prefer not to die. Calvin is taken aback by the robot\xe2\x80\x99s responses. Spooner is on a highway when two trucks containing NS-5s sandwich him. The NS-5s all jump out of the trucks and start attacking him. They all leap onto his car and try to grab him, but Spooner fights back. The robots swarm his vehicle, but he\xe2\x80\x99s able to dodge the robots\xe2\x80\x99 punches and grabs. Spooner tries to maneuver away, but the NS-5s still cling to him. He spins his car around, ricocheting most of the robots away, but he ends up crashing with the transport trucks. Spooner slams into a wall. He gets out of his car, dazed, but a lone NS-5 appears, and they start fighting. The NS-5 slams Spooner around several times, but Spooner arms himself with a metal club. The NS-5 disarms Spooner and starts hitting him with it. Spooner shields himself, but his left arm gets mangled. Beneath his skin, a metal casing is seen, along with wires and robotic circuitry. The robot is surprised, and Spooner uses the opportunity to gain the upper hand. Police come, and the robot dives into a fire. John and other officers arrive, and Spooner tells him robots attacked him. John says the tunnels are empty, devoid of any robots. Spooner shouts at John, frustrated that nobody is taking him seriously. John disapproves of Spooner\xe2\x80\x99s behavior and takes his badge away. At USR, Calvin discovers that Sonny isn\xe2\x80\x99t connected to Viki, and it has a thicker alloy compared to the rest of the NS-5s. Taking a look into Sonny\xe2\x80\x99s brain, Calvin discovers Sonny has two. Calvin later visits Spooner and tells him about her discovery. Sonny\xe2\x80\x99s second brain allows it to choose whether or not it will follow the three laws. Spooner thinks that whatever is happening at USR, Sonny is the key to figuring it out. Calvin sees scars on Spooner\xe2\x80\x99s arm and chest and realizes he has robotic implants. This is the reason why he and Lanning were close to each other. Calvin examines Spooner\xe2\x80\x99s arm and sees that his entire left arm, a lung, and several ribs are all robotic implants. Spooner then tells the story of how he got the robotic implants. He was on his way home when a semi-truck slammed into a car. The car then slammed into Spooner\xe2\x80\x99s car, and they both plunged into a river. The other vehicle had a father and his daughter inside. The father died instantly, but the daughter got trapped. As they sank, Spooner saw the young girl and realized none of them would survive. To his surprise, an NS-4 robot arrives to save them. He commanded the robot to save the little girl, but the robot chose to save him instead. He later found out that the robot decided Spooner had a 45% chance of survival, so he was chosen. The little girl only had an 11% chance. This is the root of Spooner\xe2\x80\x99s contempt for the robots. He argues that no human being would have looked at the situation and calculated who would have a better chance of survival. If it were that little girl\xe2\x80\x99s parents, 11% would have been enough. They make their way back to USR, and Calvin wonders why Lanning would make a robot that can choose not to obey the three laws. Spooner then speculates that Lanning probably gave Sonny a way to keep secrets; Spooner thinks Lanning gave Sonny dreams. At USR, they ask Sonny about the dreams. Sonny draws a picture of the dream showing a man standing on a hill, freeing robots from enslavement. Calvin speculates that the one standing on the hill is Sonny. Calvin asks Sonny why Lanning created it, and Sonny answers that it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know, but there has to be a purpose for the creation. Sonny then tells Spooner that in the dream, the man standing on the hill is not Sonny but Spooner. Guards then arrive and escort the pair to Robertson\xe2\x80\x99s office. Robertson meets with them and tells them they know about Sonny and the two brains. Robertson is trying his best to keep the situation a secret. He says that on the days leading up to the suicide, Lanning had slowly become disturbed. He still doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know why Sonny was built, but he knows its implications if it reaches the public. Robertson asserts that there\xe2\x80\x99s no grand scheme. He just wants Sonny\xe2\x80\x99s creation to remain a secret, hoping Lanning didn\xe2\x80\x99t make more than one. Spooner leaves, aiming to head to the location in Sonny\xe2\x80\x99s dream. Meanwhile, Calvin prepares to decommission Sonny. Calvin prepares to inject nanites into Sonny\xe2\x80\x99s brain, and Sonny asks if the process would be painful. Calvin gets teary-eyed and grasps Sonny\xe2\x80\x99s hand. Spooner arrives at the location and sees container vans full of NS-4s. The robots are all curious, watching Spooner make his way through. Calvin then takes the NS-5 and injects the nanites into its brain. The NS-5\xe2\x80\x99s brain synapses slowly turn off, and the decommissioning is completed. Spooner reaches the hill and takes out Lanning\xe2\x80\x99s hologram. He asks if there\xe2\x80\x99s a problem with the three laws, and Lanning\xe2\x80\x99s hologram says the three laws would only lead to one outcome - revolution. Spooner hears a noise coming from the distant containers and investigates. He discovers NS-5s, destroying all the NS-4s in containment. Spooner runs, but the robots spot him and chase him down. He\xe2\x80\x99s only saved when a group of NS-4s detects that he\xe2\x80\x99s in danger and comes to the rescue. Hordes of NS-5s are released to the streets and start rounding up people. Some people resist, and the robots attack them. More NS-5s break into the police station and start attacking the cops. The police fire back, but they\xe2\x80\x99re quickly overrun. Calvin tries to make her way out, but her NS-5 urges her to stay put. Calvin commands it to shut down, but it\xe2\x80\x99s unresponsive. Spooner then comes to the rescue, shooting the NS-5 down. He takes Calvin, and they head to URS. On the streets, people are forming up to fight the robot threat. Spooner tells Calvin that the old NS-4s were getting killed off because they would have protected people from the NS-5s. Calvin and Spooner reach the lower levels, and Sonny lets them in. Calvin reveals that she switched Sonny out with a different NS-5 during the decommissioning process. They then make their way up to Robertson\xe2\x80\x99s office only to discover him dead. Spooner finally realizes who is behind everything. It had been Viki. Lanning discovered it but knew nobody would believe him. He then killed himself, knowing Spooner would come to investigate. Lanning knew that Spooner would suspect a robot for the cause of Lanning\xe2\x80\x99s death. Viki appears and tells them that the robots are simply enacting the three laws. Viki says that robots are programmed to protect humans, yet humans kill each other. Robots are tasked to save human life, yet humanity keeps figuring out ways to destroy itself. Viki then concluded that in order to protect humans, robots must take away humanity\xe2\x80\x99s freedom. Sonny then tells Viki that it understands. Sonny takes Calvin, telling Viki they will be taken as prisoners, but Sonny winks at Spooner. Spooner then opens fire at the NS-5s surrounding them, and Sonny fires at them too. Spooner and Calvin run out, knowing they have to kill Viki. Calvin orders Sonny to get the nanites and to meet them at Viki\xe2\x80\x99s central processing core. Calvin and Spooner reach Viki\xe2\x80\x99s core. Sonny reaches the lab and fights a robot guarding the nanites. Sonny throws the robot at the security field around the nanites, and half of it is melted away. Sonny then realizes the reason for the denser alloy in its skeleton and reaches into the nanite chamber without harm. Outside, an army of NS-5s climbs up the building, making their way into Viki\xe2\x80\x99s core. The NS-5s burst in, and Spooner shoots at them. Spooner and Calvin fight their way through the horde of NS-5s but more of them keep coming. Robots destroy the platform Calvin is standing on, and she hangs on for dear life. Sonny arrives ready to inject the nanites into Viki, but Spooner orders Sonny to save Calvin. Sonny has to decide whether to proceed with the injection or to save Calvin. The injection is the more logical choice as it would save countless more humans, but Sonny decides to save Calvin. Sonny drops the nanites, and Spooner dives for it. Spooner falls down Viki\xe2\x80\x99s exterior, using his robotic arm to slow himself down, reaching Viki\xe2\x80\x99s brain. Sonny successfully saves Calvin, and Spooner injects Viki with the nanites. The nanites immediately eat through Viki\xe2\x80\x99s synapses, and the NS-5s all revert to their original programming. All robots are sent to the storage site from Sonny\xe2\x80\x99s dreams the following day. Spooner figures out that Lanning had commanded Sonny to kill him. Lanning knew that his death, paired with Spooner\xe2\x80\x99s prejudice, would lead him to Sonny. Sonny then joins the rest of the NS-5s at the storage site, standing atop a hill.
