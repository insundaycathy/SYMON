I what's up everyone. its definition here again with another unboxing. this time it's the DC. legion of collectors most wanted box. Richie, I didn't really want this box, and then I saw some of the reviews on the internet, and look like it was gonna be really good, so I decided to purchase it. so first thing, we've got the t-shirt. it's kind of like a nice villain one, and I quite like that one. it's got Aries Lex Luthor on Joker, on black mana. it's got all your favorites, all your best mates who've murdered someone. remember when geocache shot Barbara Gordon through the spine and crippled er? how? what great moment in comic book history. I like Thor movies, customs, the funny ones. rich magnets, quick me, not with the 40 quid. I got another badge. he's always come in, and it's got black men. I never really liked the character. and I started reading Suicide Squad recently, and he's sort of being drafted into that, and he's a really great addition. so, yeah, looking forward. but now, some cool little stickers. they've got Justice League advert in there. I've literally just been reading the Justice League reviews this morning. independent gave it about 1 stars. I didn't give it one star, so that's gonna be bloody brilliant. hey. and the Funko pop is, let's leave that. it is on the suit. and ran that one. so quite happy with that one. second one, it's bloody bane. this is the one I really wanted. and massively happy with that one. big, I'm a big fan of the ladder, even when he does he's is voice. so, yeah, thanks for checking out my review. really well. you know that that boxes or I think the Superman one was better, and I think the Suicide Squad almost slightly better. but you got two Funko pops in it, so you can't complain. thanks for checking out my review. take care. push
