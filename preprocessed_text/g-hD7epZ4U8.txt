Hey Guys, Welcome back to the channel. Today, we will look at the first episode of the series called \xe2\x80\x9cGirl from Nowhere\xe2\x80\x9d. So, let\xe2\x80\x99s get started. The episode starts off with a teacher meeting in a school. The school was recently awarded the \xe2\x80\x9cPurest School of the Year\xe2\x80\x9d. We are introduced to a male teacher who is advocating for the use of Yoga in the school. Everyone is impressed by this male teacher and the head of the school also gives him the approval to go ahead with his plan. The name of this teacher is Mr. Win. But, when a female teacher wants the school to teach students about safe sex, and importance of condoms, everyone gets uncomfortable. They feel that school shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a place where students need to learn about sex. The female teacher\xe2\x80\x99s name is Ms. Lucy. She is now in her class and a new student has arrived. The new student introduces herself as Nanno. Ms. Lucy tells her to pick a seat, and Nanno picks a seat next to a very scared student. Then, Mr. Win enters the class and informs everyone that the school is going to produce a promotional video, highlighting the importance of Yoga. For this, he wants volunteers who have some experience with yoga before. A very enthusiastic student raises her hand to volunteer. Mr. Win thanks her, but he says that he needs one more student. Then, Nanno raises her hand. Ms. Lucy tells Mr. Win that Nanno is a new student. Mr. Win thanks Nanno, and asks if any other students want to participate. Ms. Lucy suggests Wei, the scared student, to take part in it, as she had helped Mr. Win, with previous projects as well. But, Mr. Win says that Wei seems a little busy and he is happy with just two volunteers. Then, he says that the two volunteers need to meet him after school at the school gymnasium. After school, they start filming for the promotional video. Nanno and her friend are doing yoga poses, and Mr. Win is behind the camera. Mr. Win goes to Nanno and tries to fix her body posture. Nanno gives him a smile and does as she is told. Mr. Win is back at his house. He has a wife and a daughter who is a school student. His daughter seems to be really proud of her father. She thinks that her father is the best person in this world. She even wrote a school essay on \xe2\x80\x9cMy Idol, My Dad\xe2\x80\x9d. They look like a really happy family. Next day at school, Nanno tells her friend that the shoot for today was cancelled. Hearing this, she leaves for her home. Wei wants to tell Nanno about something, but she gets nervous and tells Nanno that it was nothing. Now, we see that Nanno was lying to her friend, as she goes to Mr. Win, and tells him that her friend didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel well and went to her home. Mr. Win starts filming and like before, he tries to fix Nanno\xe2\x80\x99s body posture. But this time, he grabs her and tries to kiss her. Nanno asks him if he knows what he is doing. She asks if he is sure about having a physical relationship with a student. But, Mr. Win doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care at all, and kisses her. He isn\xe2\x80\x99t the good guy that everyone thought he was. Later, he tells Nanno to meet him tomorrow as well. Later, we see that Wei is at Ms. Lucy\xe2\x80\x99s office. Wei tells her that her friend is getting pregnant and wants to get an abortion, She wants advice from Ms. Lucy. But, when Ms. Lucy asks her who her friend is, Wei gets nervous and leaves. Outside, she meets Nanno, who tells her that she knows a place where she can get an abortion. Nanno tells her that she knows Wei is pregnant but won\xe2\x80\x99t tell anyone. Next day, Mr. Win brings Nanno to a room. He shows Nanno that he had made videos of when they were together. He blackmails Nanno that if she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do as he says, he will put the videos online and ruin her life. So, Nanno lets him have his ways. After school, Mr. Win heads to his house. He meets his wife, who hands him his phone, which he had forgotten at school. Mr. Win asks her how she got his phone. HIs wife then tells him that one of his students brought the phone and she was now helping their daughters do her homework. The student who brought his phone is none other than Nanno. She is now having lunch with Mr. Win\xe2\x80\x99s family. Mr. Win finds out that Nanno isn\xe2\x80\x99t as scared as the other school girls. Nanno sits there comfortably, which makes Mr. Win nervous. He is afraid that Nanno will tell his wife about everything. Nanno has already impressed Mr. Win\xe2\x80\x99s daughter. She wants Nanno to be her tutor. Mr. Win\xe2\x80\x99s wife also proposes Nanno to be her tutor. Nanno happily agrees and tells that she can even bring her friends if she wants. Mr. Win just sits there and cannot say anything. Nanno has something planned for Mr. Win. Later, Mr. Win checks his phone and finds out that Nanno had recorded their conversation when he was blackmailing Nanno into sleeping with him. Next day at school, Mr. Win goes to Nanno\xe2\x80\x99s class and finds out that both Nanno and Wei were absent that day. Nanno had taken Wei to an abortion clinic. Nanno tells Wei that she had only brought her there. But she still has time to think over her decision. Mr. Win\xe2\x80\x99s daughter had brought her boyfriend to her house, to get tutored by Nanno. They are about to kiss but Nanno arrives. She tells them that they should go somewhere else to study. She takes them somewhere, and just then she receives a message from Mr. Win, who wants to meet with her. Nanno tells them to stay there for a while, and that she would return after getting something done. At school, Mr. Win meets Nanno and tries to threaten her. He tells her that if she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t delete all the recorded conversations between them, he will put all her videos online. But Nanno isn\xe2\x80\x99t fazed by it at all. She instead plays him a video of his daughter and her boyfriend. Seeing his daughter with her boyfriend, Mr. Win starts to worry. He tries to get out of there, but the doors are locked from outside. He warns Nanno and asks her where his daughter is. Mr. Win even gets on his knees to know the location of his daughter. Nanno starts laughing maniacally. She tells Mr. Win that she will only let him know the location, if he tells her the password to his computer. Mr. Win doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have much time left. So, he gives Nanno the password to his computer, which has all the videos he made with other school girls. Now, he heads to the location where his daughter is. Meanwhile, Nanno has gain access to all the videos of Mr. Win, and she has a plan on what to do next with those videos. Mr. Win\xe2\x80\x99s daughter\xe2\x80\x99s boyfriend gets a video message. The daughter asks him what it is, but he refuses to answer. She forcibly gets his phone and sees her father in a way she had never thought of him. Just then, Mr. Win arrives and starts to beat her boyfriend. His daughter tries to stop him, but Mr. Win starts shaming her for what she did. She cannot believe what her father truly was. She hands him the phone which has his videos, and heads out of there. Mr. Win tries to stop her, but she isn\xe2\x80\x99t ready to listen to anything that he says. She tells him that she no longer is his daughter. She gets away from her father and then gets into an accident, which kills her. Mr. Win starts crying, but his wife doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even let him hold his daughter. Soon, Ms. Lucy gets a message from Wei. She thanks her for her guidance and also tells her that she won\xe2\x80\x99t be getting an abortion. Wei also sends all the videos of Mr. Win and says that she can do anything she wants with those videos. Regardless to say, she hands the videos to the police.
