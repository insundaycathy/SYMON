If you woke up in a house being filled with poison gas and were told to follow a trapped treasure hunt to find the antidotes, what would you do? In this How to Beat video, we\xe2\x80\x99ll follow Jigsaw\xe2\x80\x99s latest victims, see if we can make better decisions, and ultimately attempt to beat the traps in, Saw 2. Think you can do better, let us know in the comments! Enjoy these How to Beat videos, like and subscribe! Have a movie you\xe2\x80\x99d like me to cover, reply to this comment! If you haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen my video on Saw 1, go check it out to see how all of the pain and suffering in this sequel could have been prevented. Alright, let\xe2\x80\x99s see if we can outsmart Jigsaw and his traps, again. We start out following a guy named Michael. His name isn\xe2\x80\x99t important because he probably won\xe2\x80\x99t be with us for very long. Michael cranks the standing mirror over to see why his eye hurts so fricking much. The results are inconclusive, but it\xe2\x80\x99s definitely not a stye. The TV turns on and an evil Dr. Phil tells him that his career as a police informant is over unless he proves himself worthy. The rules of the game are as follows.. The funny thing about the key he needs, is that it\xe2\x80\x99s located in the clear jelly-like core of his eyeball. This takes the phrase, \xe2\x80\x98snitches get stitches\xe2\x80\x99 to an entirely new level. Man, this makes Amanda seem lucky. She got to scalpel someone else. Michael has to scalpel himself. Jigsaw doesn\xe2\x80\x99t provide a demonstration for this trap, but I think it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty clear what will happen when this nail filled mask slams shut. Michael\xe2\x80\x99s first course of action is to scream for help, which beautifully reverberates around the concrete basement he\xe2\x80\x99s entombed in. The wire attached to his head contraption isn\xe2\x80\x99t helping the claustrophobic feeling of being in here, so he yanks it off. Unfortunately, this triggered the spring-loaded clock. Based on the ticking sound, he\xe2\x80\x99s got 60 seconds. You can make cupcake baking stressful by adding a timer. This guy\xe2\x80\x99s head is inside a nail filled venus fly trap with seconds before it closes. He better be able to think clearly under stress. The first thing he sees is a little box on the ground next to him, which has a scalpel in it. You could take the scalpel as a bad sign, or cringe at the thought of slitting your eyeball open like a Pokeball, but at least you have the scalpel. It could be worse. Jigsaw could have left him with nothing and forced him to dig his fingers into his eye socket and rip his eyeball out to get the key. Michael can\xe2\x80\x99t muster up the nerve to dig through his eye before his time runs out, and his game ends. Let\xe2\x80\x99s rewind and see what Michael could have done to beat this trap without performing surgery on himself. Right off the bat, he shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have yanked the wire out which initiated the countdown and caused his stress levels to go nuclear. I think this is a reasonable error he could have avoided. When Jigsaw was talking about the \xe2\x80\x98spring-loaded\xe2\x80\x99 timer on his death mask, Michael had felt around and located a circular device with a glass face which was attached to the wire. He could also have confirmed this by using the mirror. It\xe2\x80\x99s not a stretch to think that in order for a \xe2\x80\x98spring-loaded\xe2\x80\x99 timer to be activated, something holding the spring-loaded has to be removed. It should have been obvious that it was the wired pin inserted into the timer. The next move would be to try to figure out a way to dismantle the pulley system which could pull the wire and set the trap off. Even with the trigger disarmed, you\xe2\x80\x99d still want to get the bear trap off your head in case it was set off somehow. Using the mirror and feeling around, he\xe2\x80\x99d see that this head contraption was mounted on a leather harness with a waist band and shoulder straps secured by padlocks. The device looks like a single piece design that was slipped over his head. What also makes me think that, is that the key he needs to find unlocks the padlocks on his harness, not the device. He could use the scalpel to cut the straps and lift the device off over his head. If Michael had pulled the pin and started the timer by accident, I still think he could have cut the leather straps off in time to slip the device off before it snapped shut. If I\xe2\x80\x99m wrong and it is a two piece design that was tightly fitted around his neck and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be lifted off, well, then that sucks, especially if he\xe2\x80\x99s on the clock. His only option besides getting the key is to jam the device by either shoving the flimsy toolbox in between the levers by his neck, or put the metal stool over his head. Bear traps can exert up to 1000 pounds of pressure, so I'd go with the stool and not the thin metal box. Michael circumventing this trap by jamming it or cutting himself loose might not be enough to beat it if he\xe2\x80\x99s locked in a concrete cell. Jigsaw usually requires his victim to sacrifice their pound of flesh in order to be free\xe2\x80\x99d, so the door may not be opened for him until he obtains the key. Digging through his vitreous humour to find the key to the door is still a last ditch move. I\xe2\x80\x99d try to wait a few days before putting myself under the knife in hopes that someone found me. Turns out, this was a good call. Michael\xe2\x80\x99s body was found by county asbestos cleaners a day or so later. Detective Allison Kerry is the lead on the case, but she brings Detective Eric Matthews in because Michael was his informant. Or I should say, they think the body was his informant based on the writing on the ceiling and the video tapes. Eric is able to identify the body as his informant based on a tattoo, so Allison pries further to see if he has any idea who would be capable of engineering all this. Eric\xe2\x80\x99s no Jim Gordon. He\xe2\x80\x99s completely unmotivated to take on this case with the backdrop of his crumbling family life, even after being called out by Jigsaw himself. Back at the police station, Allison\xe2\x80\x99s reviewing the tapes trying to find clues. She\xe2\x80\x99s not very good at her job, so she ropes Eric in to take Jigsaw\xe2\x80\x99s bait in hopes that she can catch a lead off of it. Look, I\xe2\x80\x99m no detective, but does following a serial killer's clues ever really help you? They wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have given you a clue if they thought it\xe2\x80\x99d lead to them getting caught. Eric wakes up in the middle of the night when he\xe2\x80\x99s suddenly hit with the realization that Michael\xe2\x80\x99s device had the logo of the abandoned Wilson Steel factory on it. Obvious bait, but Eric think\xe2\x80\x99s he\xe2\x80\x99s more clever than he actually is and calls Allison with the news. Allison should know from investigating Jigsaw\xe2\x80\x99s previous victims that he isn\xe2\x80\x99t stupid and wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t leave clues out like this unless he wanted them to show up at the factory and play another one of his games. What would I do if I was Allison? Not go into the factory. Has Allison already forgotten what happened to Detective Tapp and Sing? Besides being dangerous as hell, you\xe2\x80\x99re just playing into his hand. I would get the blueprint for the factory and stake out all the exits. Jigsaw wants us to run into his funhouse. He wants us to play his game. By playing hard to get, Jigsaw might emerge from hiding in order to tempt our attention again. Again, Allison\xe2\x80\x99s a sitty detective with no leads so far, so she\xe2\x80\x99s perfectly fine letting Eric walk right into a trap. At least they got a warrant and called in a SWAT team instead of bum rushing in like Detective Tapp and Sing did in Saw 1. The SWAT team makes entry, but as expected, the factory is trapped. The other SWAT operators apparently didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear the buzzing sound of the metal fencing being electrified or thought it was just the sound of the lights. The rest of the SWAT team pushes through to the second floor and finds Jigsaw doodling out some new trap designs while eating Cheerios. They cuff him up and Eric rolls in to drop the one-liner he was practicing on the drive over. This just show\xe2\x80\x99s Eric\xe2\x80\x99s naivety and why he shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be on the case. When taking down the evil mastermind is this easy, and they are that calm when apprehended, you should be wondering how you\xe2\x80\x99re getting played instead of getting cocky. Jigsaw tells Eric that instead of going straight to a jail cell, he\xe2\x80\x99ll hang out here while Eric deals with the problem in the room across from them. Right about now it should be hitting them that they fricked up coming here. The SWAT team captain tosses a pipe to the fencing to make sure it\xe2\x80\x99s not electrified, which is a good call considering what happened earlier. Eric and Allison enter and uncover a bunch of monitors displaying Jigsaw\xe2\x80\x99s latest victims in a trap. One of those victims is Daniel, Eric\xe2\x80\x99s son. What happened to the United States does not negotiate with terrorists. Throw this demented cancer patient in a hole and throw away the hole. He thinks he has leverage because he thinks he can get you to play his game. Villains like Jigsaw orchestrate their escapes by throwing victims at the police as distractions. The way to end it is by not negotiating. You just take the L on those victims and eliminate the target. It\xe2\x80\x99s not the most political move, but it stops this sit dead in its tracks and heavily disincentivizes future terrorists because it\xe2\x80\x99s no longer an effective strategy. It\xe2\x80\x99s like John Wick dome shotting Santino in the Continental. If Allison wanted to take the trophy home on the Jigsaw case, this is the out of the box thinking that Jigsaw would not expect whatsoever. Of course she\xe2\x80\x99d have to take charge and pull Eric off the case ASAP before Jigsaw got Eric too emotionally invested, because in this situation, taking the L on the victims means his son might die. Eric calls his son\xe2\x80\x99s phone number and Jigsaw tells him to leave a message after the beep. Yep, it\xe2\x80\x99s confirmed, his son\xe2\x80\x99s in deep sit. But everyone needs to take a deep breath here. Jigsaw\xe2\x80\x99s trying to get everyone tilted. Let\xe2\x80\x99s think this through. From Allison\xe2\x80\x99s investigation of all of Jigsaw\xe2\x80\x99s previous cases, she would know that he often speaks with loaded phrases that are more literal than they seem, so Eric needs to be relaying everything he hears Jigsaw say to Allison, especially things like this.. This completely contradicts what he just said moments earlier. About Daniel having 2 hours before the poisonous gas breaks his tissue down and floods his lungs with blood. The 2 hours thing is bothering me for another reason too. There are 7 victims in the trap on the monitor. Jigsaw says that he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t checked the monitors in a bit, but he thinks they have about 2 hours left before they are dead. This is a tight timeline. Too tight. I don\xe2\x80\x99t really buy that Jigsaw put the victims in there, and timed the police arrival perfectly so that there was 2 hours remaining before the gas killed the victims. He even put a clock in there with 2 hours counting down. If Eric hadn\xe2\x80\x99t had his revelation quickly enough, hesitated a little, or the police just didn\xe2\x80\x99t gear up and make it to the factory as quickly as they did, the victims would all be dead and the meta game involving Eric wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t work. The counter-points would be that Jigsaw had the gas flow on a remote, and triggered it when the police showed up. Or that he had help that triggered it when the police showed up to the factory. It does make sense that he had help, a late stage cancer patient wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be able to snare 7 people and drag them into a trap room. These both still don\xe2\x80\x99t explain the incredibly coincidental timing of when they showed up to the factory, and when the victims woke up, found the cassette tape, and started progressing through the trap. For all they know, this isn\xe2\x80\x99t real time footage at all. They need to bring in a computer forensics team to start investigating the feed and broadcasting location, which they do, as well as bring in a bomb squad team to help the SWAT team turn this factory inside out looking for anything useful, which they don\xe2\x80\x99t do. Apparently everyone thinks sitting on their asses watching Jigsaw\xe2\x80\x99s reality TV is going to solve the case. Jigsaw tells Eric that he just wants to talk to him alone, which Eric reluctantly agrees to. He does sneak a radio in too so Allison can listen in. With Jigsaw in their custody, how could he possibly ensure the safety and security of Daniel by sitting here talking with Eric when Daniel\xe2\x80\x99s in a trapped house being filled with poison gas with 6 other desperate strangers. The most reasonable answer is he can\xe2\x80\x99t. Even if Jigsaw technically didn\xe2\x80\x99t specify whether Daniel would be dead or alive when returned, he still couldn\xe2\x80\x99t ensure that his corpse was in a \xe2\x80\x98safe\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98secure\xe2\x80\x99 state. Based on the previous cases Allison is aware of, Jigsaw has honored the rules of the games he\xe2\x80\x99s created, even if he lies or double speaks about some aspects, and winning is an option. So if winning is an option for Eric, then technically the only way for Jigsaw to ensure the conditions and availability of the prize, AKA Daniel, is to already have Daniel in a safe place somewhere. The fact that the time coordination between Eric and Daniel\xe2\x80\x99s game is highly implausible, and outcome coordination of Daniel\xe2\x80\x99s game is near impossible would make me very suspicious that this is pre-recorded footage. And the longer Daniel survives in the game on the monitor, the higher the probability that this is pre-recorded. They could also try to bluff Jigsaw by confronting him about how they \xe2\x80\x98know\xe2\x80\x99 it\xe2\x80\x99s pre-recorded, that the screen feed is paused or stuck, that Daniel is dead and they are taking him to jail now. Jigsaw can\xe2\x80\x99t see the monitors, so if he expressed that he knew anything it\xe2\x80\x99d be suspect. The interesting thing about this game is that Jigsaw is in police custody. If Eric puts on some beethoven and kicks his feet up, Daniel will be returned to him and Jigsaw would go to jail. Seems like an outcome Jigsaw would want to avoid, but he might not care because he\xe2\x80\x99s almost dead, and whoever is helping him will continue his legacy. Still, not exactly a preferable way to go out. Nor is it interesting. Jigsaw has demonstrated that he knows Eric\xe2\x80\x99s shady off the books tendencies. If I was Allison, I\xe2\x80\x99d anticipate Jigsaw baiting Eric into doing something stupid to get his son back, which will entail wittingly or unwittingly helping Jigsaw escape. How could Eric possibly walk out of here with Jigsaw without them being able to follow? Well, if they paid attention, secured the blueprints for the building, and properly secured the area, they\xe2\x80\x99d know that Jigsaw is sitting in a utility elevator. Convenient that he\xe2\x80\x99d want to remain there for the duration of the game. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t bag Jigsaw right now, or let him know that I knew his plan. Daniel could still be anywhere, so we need Jigsaw to lead us to him. We start following the 7 unlucky contestants in the trap house being filled with poison gas. Well, they don\xe2\x80\x99t know that yet. While they definitely aren\xe2\x80\x99t in jail, they are being held captive with a camera watching their movements. Daniel graciously points out that those types of cameras don\xe2\x80\x99t have sound. A woman named Amanda, who we\xe2\x80\x99re all familiar with, wakes up with a look of horror and panic on her face. She immediately starts running around checking every nook and cranny until she finds the infamous cassette recorder. Not exactly a subtle move on her part. Now everyone knows that she knows what\xe2\x80\x99s going on. She hits play on the cassette recorder.. He then goes on to say that several antidotes are hidden around the house, 1 of which is in the safe in this room. He says they each have the combination numbers for the safe written on the back of their minds, and the order of the numbers can be found over the rainbow. I don\xe2\x80\x99t see any rainbows, but maybe there\xe2\x80\x99s a box of lucky charms with instructions inside. Jigsaw also says that once they realize what they have in common, they will better understand why they are here. For this clue, X marks the spot. Finding out what they have in common doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound like it leads to an antidote, so this is a waste of time. There\xe2\x80\x99s no point in covering your mouth with clothing or anything like that. Nerve gas vapor can permeate your skin, so clothing or a paper mask won\xe2\x80\x99t stop it. Amanda should know from helping Jigsaw set up traps and being a previous victim that his phrasing is loaded and often literal. She should be checking the back of their heads &amp; necks for numbers. This is later revealed to be where Jigsaw hid the numbers. It shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be too hard for Amanda to figure out that the numbers were colored, and with 7 victims in the trap and 7 letters in the ROYGBIV acronym, this is how the combination is ordered. The vault only contains 1 antidote based on Jigsaw\xe2\x80\x99s message, so she needs to be secretive about collecting the others\xe2\x80\x99 numbers, and then she needs to get herself alone with the vault so the others don\xe2\x80\x99t fight her for it. Amanda doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to have learned much from her time with Jigsaw. That or she\xe2\x80\x99s not actually a victim here.. Xavier picks up a letter on the ground with a key attached to it. It says, do not attempt to use this key in the door to this room. Neglecting Amanda\xe2\x80\x99s warnings, Xavier tries to unlock the door with the key while Gus looks through the peephole. Okay.. let\xe2\x80\x99s not break the rules from now on. This trap was odd. Why was the gun aimed through the peephole? It's extremely unlikely that someone would be looking through the peephole while they or someone else simultaneously unlocked the door. It would make more sense to aim the barrel of the gun through the doorknob so that the bullet was directed straight into the person trying to open it. The other victims start questioning Amanda as to how she knew about the rules, the tape, and Jigsaw. Amanda tells them that she\xe2\x80\x99s played one of his games before. Yah, I'd neglect to mention that I was Jigsaw\xe2\x80\x99s apprentice too. Everyone buys her half of the story, and starts turning the room inside out trying to find the key to the vault with no luck. The door to the room suddenly opens by itself. It appears to have been on a time delay. They all start dispersing through the house looking for clues, but the more intelligent victims are also grabbing weapons. These antidotes are sparse. Unless this herd gets thinned out a lot, there won\xe2\x80\x99t be enough for all of them. It should go without saying that they should be treading very lightly and using extreme caution when manipulating any objects unless they want to end up like Gus. That means not fixing crooked picture frames. Jesus dude, that\xe2\x80\x99s one of the most well-known types of booby-traps out there. Xavier tries using the spiked bat to break down the door labeled exit, but it\xe2\x80\x99s metal reinforced. Gee, I'm shocked that the door labeled exit wasn\xe2\x80\x99t actually an exit. I do think Xavier has the right idea. He\xe2\x80\x99s just thinking a little too in the box. This is an entire house, not a tiny concrete room. I highly doubt the entire building is covered in metal barricades, more likely they just cover the weak points like windows and doors. The 7 of them with access to weapons and tools should be able to knock down a wall or break through the weaker ceilings within 2 hours. If they attempted this, they\xe2\x80\x99d want to blind the cameras too, just in case their captor was watching and decided to up the gas flow for breaking the rules. Laura finds a door leading down into the basement, where they find another cassette tape stuck in a doll with a note for Obi. Welp, Obi\xe2\x80\x99s dead. There\xe2\x80\x99s no way the others let him walk out of here after hearing that and Laura\xe2\x80\x99s witness testimony of Obi abducting her. Obi tries to save his own ass by volunteering to go into the furnace to get the needles, saying that he gets one if he makes it out. I know nobody wants to volunteer to go into an obviously trapped furnace, but putting two antidotes in the hands of the sociopath who kidnapped all of you isn\xe2\x80\x99t a good idea either. And really, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t get those antidotes, you\xe2\x80\x99re dead anyways. Jonas questions whether or not they should even be getting and sticking themselves with these needles, and up until now I'd have agreed with him. But with everyone starting to collapse and cough up blood, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think they have a choice. Before going in they should check for gas lines and shut them if possible, jam the door open and have someone hold his feet ready to pull him out if sit goes south, as well as check for any additional engineering that was done to the furnace. They know from Gus and the peephole cannon that Jigsaw uses rather unsophisticated mechanics that they need to watch for. Like this obvious pulley right next to the door that Obi completely misses. Again, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have sent a selfish bastard like Obi in, but since they did, they might as well ensure his safety so he brings back the antidotes. Obi finds the antidotes dangling from chains hanging on the ceiling of the furnace. This guy\xe2\x80\x99s like Marv from Home Alone. Harry, I\xe2\x80\x99ve reached the antidotes. When he goes to pull the second antidote, instead of carefully pulling the syringe from the chain, he just yanks the chain connected to the pulley and wire connected to the door pulls it shut and ignites the furnace. God damn this was so obvious it hurts, but this was the same dipsit who fixed the crooked picture frames in a booby trapped house. There\xe2\x80\x99s a nozzle across the flames that says twist me, which based on the tapes is a method for extinguishing the flames. Obi\xe2\x80\x99s too much of a botch to take the hit and twist the nozzle, so he goes up in flames along with the antidotes. The others break the back window and Obi manages to squeeze his head and arm through, but it\xe2\x80\x99s too late. Obi is dust and ashes from the neck down. They check to see if that was the hand holding the needles, but nope. To be fair to Obi, the antidotes weren\xe2\x80\x99t ranking high on the priority list at the time. Everyone\xe2\x80\x99s really starting to succumb to the effects by now. They\xe2\x80\x99ve already burned away an hour and still haven\xe2\x80\x99t gotten any antidotes. Xavier and the others find a semi-stuck door and try to force their way in. I swear, the nerve gas must be affecting their vision, because I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how they don\xe2\x80\x99t see the pulley and wire right above the door. He forces it open, pulling the pin on the clock on the door across the room which shows 4 minutes counting down. Muscles runs over and tries to open the metal vault door with his bare hands. This guys the living embodiment of the saying, when all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. Jonas finds the cassette tape with Xavier\xe2\x80\x99s name on it and pops it into the cassette recorder. After finishing the tape and realizing their mission, they only have 2 minutes left to find the key in the needlestack. Jigsaw wants us to jump in and start hand digging for it, which is a terrible method. Shuffling the needles around is far too slow. I\xe2\x80\x99d have two people with shoes grab the crate and baby carriage and start bucketing out the needles. By dispersing the needles over a greater area and removing them from the pool, others can more easily sift through them and check for the key. Meanwhile, another two people can use the spiked bat and shovel that Amanda was previously holding to fish around. This chain gang isn\xe2\x80\x99t in a cooperative, team-first mindset. Xavier grabs Amanda and throws her into the pit of needles, presumably because she was a junkie and would be the most comfortable with the situation. Everyone\xe2\x80\x99s yelling at him for being an asshole, which he is, but at least he acted. None of you botches were doing anything. Once Amanda gets past the initial shock factor, she starts scrambling around and miraculously finds the key which conveniently has a glow tube attached to it for visibility. She tosses it to Xavier who fumbles the key at the 10 yard line, causing the door to be locked, the antidote to be lost, and all Amanda\xe2\x80\x99s work to be in vain. They\xe2\x80\x99ve lost every antidote so far, their time\xe2\x80\x99s running out, and their chance of securing more antidotes is slim. Even if they get another antidote, it\xe2\x80\x99s not enough for all of them. It\xe2\x80\x99s time for plan B, which is busting through the wall. Xavier of all people correctly guesses the solution to the number riddle. I\xe2\x80\x99d have guessed that the combo had something to do with them all being prisoners, like their cell or inmate numbers. Nope, Jigsaw just sharpied the number on the back of their necks. Gus has a red number 2 on his neck. Now he just has to get everyone else's number. Jonas wants to help, but with only one antidote in the vault and Xavier\xe2\x80\x99s test-rage kicking in, peace was never an option. Jonas has some moves, but not enough to keep him alive. Jonas\xe2\x80\x99 number is a yellow 16. Xavier\xe2\x80\x99s lucky that Obi popped his head out of the furnace, but even if Obi turned to ashes, he might still be able to brute force the last number in time. Obi\xe2\x80\x99s number is a green 11. I hope he\xe2\x80\x99s writing these down. The others are oblivious to this and still trying to find clues. As Laura chokes to death on her vomit, she points out the X crack in a glass picture frame. Behind it is a picture of Daniel with his Dad, the man who put them all in prison with planted evidence. As expected, nobody really cares too much. It\xe2\x80\x99s not like Jigsaw hid an antidote inside Daniel. Addison decided that she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t trust them, so she braves a new trap room by herself. There\xe2\x80\x99s a plexiglass box hanging from the ceiling with two holes in the bottom and an antidote inside. There\xe2\x80\x99s also a note with a cassette tape, but she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have the player so she won\xe2\x80\x99t be getting any hints. Addison\xe2\x80\x99s immediate action is shoving her hands into the boxes holes without any inspection, testing, or caution. Never stick your hands in unfamiliar holes, that\xe2\x80\x99s just common sense general life advice. She should have used a foot of the wooden chair behind her to stick in the hole to test it, or just visually checked it from the top and bottom. Then she could use the stick to keep the blades up while she \xe2\x80\x98carefully\xe2\x80\x99 pulled the antidote out from the plunger side. Once her hand is inside the box, she tries to grab the antidote, but tugged on the capsule which separated it from the plunger and released the contents. Another antidote down the drain. When she tries to pull her hand out, the blades cinch in and trap her wrist. I think she could squeeze her other hand into the same whole and push the blades up with her fingers to free her hand. If it\xe2\x80\x99s too tight, maybe she could shove her belt up into it or something. Addison\xe2\x80\x99s not the smartest tool in the shed, so she shoves her other hand in the other hole to grab the empty syringe capsule. Must be the poison affecting her. Writhing is just going to make things worse. She might be able to shove her arms in further and hold up the opposing side\xe2\x80\x99s blades to get one arm free, then get her remaining arm free using the methods we already mentioned. But yah, at this point she\xe2\x80\x99s pretty stuck. She doesn\xe2\x80\x99t realize Xavier\xe2\x80\x99s on a murdering rampage yet, so from her POV calling for help is the best option now. Xavier arrives with no intention of helping, and pulls her hair back to get her number. Green 9. Amanda discovers Jonas\xe2\x80\x99s caved in skull and hears Xavier yelling to find them. He\xe2\x80\x99s already hell bent on killing them, but Daniel dropping the picture sure as sit didn\xe2\x80\x99t help. In Xavier\xe2\x80\x99s chase he finds Laura\xe2\x80\x99s body and collects her number too. Amanda and Daniel wedge the door shut against Xavier. It seems like they are stuck until Amanda finds a secret basement door. They escape through it and wind up in a dead end, which also happens to be the bathroom from Saw 1. Adam didn\xe2\x80\x99t age too well, nor did Zep or Lawrence\xe2\x80\x99s foot. Xavier chases them down, but before he kills them for their numbers Amanda hits him with the big Q. How will he get his own number? This distracts Xavier into cutting his neck skin off to get it, which opens an opportunity for Daniel to saw his carotid artery open. That was the same Saw Lawrence used on his foot. Nasty. Xavier really should have killed them before the self-surgery. Sidenote, Xavier made it pretty damn far without dying from the poison. Dude was a tank. Amanda and Daniel on the other hand, never showed any symptoms. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think a nerve gas was being pumped in, I think everyone was poisoned except Amanda and Daniel. Makes sense, Daniel has to live for Eric\xe2\x80\x99s metagame to work. Amanda not being poisoned, however, is extremely suspicious. Back in the factory, Eric loses his mind watching all this go down and tries to beat his son\xe2\x80\x99s location out of Jigsaw. Allison, this is what Jigsaw wants, why haven\xe2\x80\x99t you talked sense into Eric. Again, the fact that Daniel is still alive means that the probability of this being pre-recorded is very high, otherwise Jigsaw\xe2\x80\x99s meta game falls apart. Jigsaw says, \xe2\x80\x9cgame over\xe2\x80\x9d, and that he will take Eric to Daniel on the condition that nobody follows them. And there it is, Jigsaw\xe2\x80\x99s brilliant escape plan. Eric hit\xe2\x80\x99s the elevator button which takes them to the underground garage where his getaway car is parked. Allison was just completely gobsmacked by this wholly unpredictable move. There was just no way of anticipating that Jigsaw had an escape plan or could have known he was sitting in an elevator. Eric should have grabbed the radio before leaving so he could let the SWAT team know his location after Jigsaw spills the beans. Right after their escape, the tech team gets a lock on the location the broadcast was originating from. Jigsaw leads Eric to the house, and Eric hops out and heads inside without taking literally any precautions. He should have brought the radio or used his cell phone to call in his location now that he arrived. He should have cuffed Jigsaw to the car, knee-caped, or killed him right there. Why Eric in all his rage didn\xe2\x80\x99t kill Jigsaw once they arrived is beyond me. I get that Eric thinks he\xe2\x80\x99s on a time crunch, but waiting 5-10 minutes for SWAT to get there seems reasonable given the danger Jigsaw\xe2\x80\x99s trap houses pose. The police show up to the house where the broadcast was originating from, except it\xe2\x80\x99s not the house the victims were in that Jigsaw led Eric too. It was a proxy house that was serving up old footage. The timer hits zero and buzzes open a vault in the corner of the room. Inside is little Daniel, breathing through a mask. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to assume that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t make a peep this whole time because he was breathing in sleeping gas until the timer hit zero. Still, nobody checked what the countdown timer was hooked up too? Are the bomb and geek squad they brought in really that fricking incompetent? Eric makes his way down into the basement where Xavier\xe2\x80\x99s body has been rotting for days. If only he brought his radio or someone called him with the news that Daniel was safe. It looks like there is someone in the tub in the back of the bathroom. In his approach, he stupidly holsters his weapon and gets within jump-scare distance. Why. Just why. Eric\xe2\x80\x99s stupidity finally catches up with him. What is with pigmask abducting people with the worst strategy imaginable. You\xe2\x80\x99re going to hide in a tub, in the trap house that Eric thinks his son was murdered, with dead bodies everywhere, with a pig uniform on, in hopes that he holsters his gun and gets close enough to you so you can stab him with a syringe. Eric wakes up chained to the wall with a cassette tape next to him. At this point do you even need to listen to the tape? You have to realize you\xe2\x80\x99re an idiot who's completely fricked himself. He hit\xe2\x80\x99s play and Amanda basically tells him it\xe2\x80\x99s game over and he\xe2\x80\x99s going to rot in the bathroom like Adam. The movie ends with Jigsaw chuckling at the thought of Eric getting played like a fiddle. Let\xe2\x80\x99s recap the pivotal points where different decisions could have altered who lived and died. Breaking out of the house was an option in my opinion. Then they could all hit up the hospital and reveal the location of Jigsaw\xe2\x80\x99s base. Gus looking through the peephole was unnecessary and unlucky. He was always dead. Obi\xe2\x80\x99s death was entirely preventable, and they could have secured two antidotes. Xavier not seeing the pulley above the stuck door was pretty dumb as well. They could have secured another antidote, leaving three in need. Addison\xe2\x80\x99s trap was also entirely beatable. That\xe2\x80\x99s another antidote. Xavier wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been so aggressive and desperate with all these antidotes, and with his brains, they\xe2\x80\x99d have secured one more antidote. Interestingly, there\xe2\x80\x99s only 5 antidotes. This somewhat confirms my suspicion that Amanda and Daniel were never poisoned. This all seems well and good, but I doubt the antidotes were effective. Like the overdosed man in Amanda\xe2\x80\x99s first game, they were merely pawns in Amanda, Daniel, and Eric\xe2\x80\x99s games. So all of them were dead no matter what. If the detectives weren\xe2\x80\x99t morons they would have deduced that there was a high probability of the game being prerecorded, checked what the countdown timer was linked to, turned the factory inside out, got the blueprints to the factory, realized that Jigsaw was sitting in an elevator, and anticipated Jigsaw\xe2\x80\x99s game likely involved an escape plan involving Eric, Jigsaw likely wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been successful. If Eric had radioed in his location, the SWAT team would have raided the actual house, taken down Amanda and Jigsaw, and saved Eric\xe2\x80\x99s life. Even if Amanda fled, there\xe2\x80\x99s substantial evidence that points to her being connected with Jigsaw. Her being involved and surviving two games means she has recurring ties to him. Daniel\xe2\x80\x99s negative toxicology reports and Amanda surviving with him to the end without showing any symptoms is indicative that she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t poisoned either. As a detective you have to ask why. All said and done, I think we could have beaten the traps from Saw 2. Thanks for watching, and remember, be a good person and value each day you\xe2\x80\x99re alive. Or you might end up in a psychopath\xe2\x80\x99s torture dungeon.
