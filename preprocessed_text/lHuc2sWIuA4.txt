Welcome to Cinema Summary, ladies and gentlemen. Do you ever ever feel like your friends are acting weird and different? What if it\xe2\x80\x99s not them. What if it's paranormal? What if it's the comet that's passing by? This is Coherence (2013). We first open to a woman, Emily, driving to a reunion dinner with her friends while talking on the phone with her boyfriend When Emily finally gets to the house, their connection cuts out and then her phone screen cracks in her hand for no reason. Inside, Emily reunites with Mike, Beth, and Lee and mentions that her phone broke and thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s due to \xe2\x80\x9cMiller\xe2\x80\x99s Comet\xe2\x80\x9d. Which is supposed to be passing over them tonight, which according to Emily produces a radiation that could break electronic devices like her phone So a quick rundown of this film is that this is a science fiction movie about 8 people in a house, and a comet that's passing by and the effect that this comet has on these people Emily\xe2\x80\x99s phone was broken by the comet's radiation and the comet is only now starting take effect because its passing by. But we're gonna see that it can do more than just break phones We find out that their friend Amir is bringing Laurie. and Emily isn\xe2\x80\x99t isn\xe2\x80\x99t happy about this since Laurie dated Kevin, Emily\xe2\x80\x99s now-boyfriend. So Beth offers her own brand of tranquilizers that could help Emily take the edge off. It\xe2\x80\x99s full of natural herbs and ketamine and in case Emily wants to relax it will be here in the kitchen and Beth puts the ketamine down and picks up a plant and asks Lee where she bought it. "Galaxy that thrift store" Now keep this sentence in mind because it comes back later. But their conversation is cut short after Kevin and Hugh arrive. Kevin being Emily\xe2\x80\x99s boyfriend and Hugh being Beth\xe2\x80\x99s husband. And a few moments later, Amir and Laurie arrive As everyone goes to the dinner table, Laurie and Kevin share an awkward "hi" together But regardless of that, it's time to eat As they\xe2\x80\x99re having dinner, no one is able to get reception on their cell phones and it gets them talking about comet. Especially Emily who knows a lot about comets. Like how in Finland, after a comet passed, people began going a little crazy. In particular, a woman called the police telling them that \xe2\x80\x98her husband\xe2\x80\x99 wasn't 'her husband\xe2\x80\x99 since she had killed him yesterday. But the police couldn\xe2\x80\x99t arrest her since her husband was alive. And also right next to her And from there, the conversation turns from comets To Beth\xe2\x80\x99s sister, someone who Amir had never heard of until now After that Mike asks Laurie what\xe2\x80\x99s she been up to and it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty impressive: she\xe2\x80\x99s busy with Outreach programs with at-risk youths but that confuses him. Mike\xe2\x80\x99s pretty sure Laurie was teaching yoga. Spanish yoga. and Laurie defensively asks Mike what he does. and well, he\xe2\x80\x99s an out-of-work actor who at one point was a part of the TV show Roswell. A show Laurie loves except she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t recognize Mike even though he was the main character, a fact that everyone at the table seems to know except her. Which is pretty odd. Hugh then reveals that his phone is cracked and broken just like Emily\xe2\x80\x99s phone: It no longer works. In fact none of their phones work and even the computer\xe2\x80\x99s internet is nonfunctional. Which is worrying since Hugh wanted to call his brother whose a bit of a science geek who warned him (Hugh) to call him in case anything weird happened this night and then suddenly there's a blackout The guests light candles until Mike comes to the rescue with 3 boxes of glowsticks: red, blue, and green, and decides to give everyone a blue glow stick for themselves and after Mike goes outside He comes back, telling everyone that the entire neighborhood is blacked out except for 1 house. Which is 'all lit up' But there\xe2\x80\x99s something else: it\xe2\x80\x99s dark. Darker than it\xe2\x80\x99s ever been on most nights. So the group with their glowsticks all go out very carefully where outside they see the comet fly across the sky. They go back inside and notice one of the glasses is chipped; See, what I told you? The radiation can do more than crack phones Did you guys notice that Amir had no knowledge as to who Beth\xe2\x80\x99s sister was? and that Mike and Laurie were confused about each other? These are important clues to who exactly they are and what exactly is going on because Amir and Laurie, have been affected by something. as to what this is, well, we'll find out later Inside, they talk about the blackout and the house with the lights on, until Hugh announces that he wants to go to the other house to use their phone to contact his brother. So, Amir goes with Hugh to keep him safe, to the other house. As the rest of the group waits, suddenly they hear banging on the side door. Kevin peeks outside but he can\xe2\x80\x99t see anyone out there. and then Mike manages to get the electricity back on with the generator. and that's when Hugh and Amir come back. Hugh is bleeding from his head and gets his head patched up with a bandaid as Amir talks about the box that he brought back What\xe2\x80\x99s with the box? Well... Amir took it after he saw Hugh drop it and run around a corner after seeing something But Hugh has no idea what Amir is talking about and is adamant that it has nothing to do with what he saw. and then everyone\'s like "Wait, then what did you see then?" and he refuses to talk about it At first they think to put the box back but Mike decides to open it and inside the box is a ping-pong paddle and photos of everyone at the party. On the back of each photo is a number. Confused, the group demands Hugh to tell them what he saw and he reluctantly tells them that he peeked into the other house and saw a table set for 8 people: implying, that he saw duplicates of themselves. Then Hugh decides to go out to the other house and writes down a note, asking to borrow their phone, but then Laurie spots someone at the door. It\xe2\x80\x99s a tall guy and as Hugh is finished writing his note, Kevin opens the door and finds a note taped to it. He reads it aloud for everyone to hear \xe2\x80\x9cHey there! Don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to freak you out. But we just wanted to borrow your phone for five minutes tops. Thanks.\xe2\x80\x9d It's the same note that Hugh just finished writing. Do you know what this means? This means that there's another version of the group out there in the their own version of the house Doing the exact same thing. They (Other Group) delivered the note first, which means that They're a bit ahead of the first group presumably another version of Hugh delivered the note. With that being said, it gets even more complicated from here on out That\xe2\x80\x99s when Mike decides to go over there to meet their \xe2\x80\x98hypothetical duplicates\xe2\x80\x99 and the group splits up with Hugh, Amir, Beth, and Lee staying behind in the house Outside its eerie, no one\xe2\x80\x99s walking around, it\xe2\x80\x99s pitch black and as they walk the empty neighborhood. Laurie, Kevin, Emily, and MIke see a quartet of people with red glowsticks who are exactly identical to them. The group return back to the house, running to the house and tell the rest of the group about their other selves with the red glow sticks Emily also mentions that there\xe2\x80\x99s an area where it\xe2\x80\x99s darker than the rest of neighborhood. She calls it \xe2\x80\x98The Dark Zone\xe2\x80\x99 and it\xe2\x80\x99s something that Hugh and Amir had noticed and walked through, earlier. They need answers. Now. And Emily asks if there\xe2\x80\x99s any books that might help them out and surprisingly Beth has one! A book that belongs to Hugh\xe2\x80\x99s brother but its in their car. So Hugh and Kevin go get it. and it\xe2\x80\x99s a scientific book about quantum physics and quantum theory and the many worlds interpretation theory So the Darkzone is important to the story. because it was created by the comet and the radiation. and we later find out that It bridges multiple realities together and when you walk through it, you end up another reality. Which means: that everytime you enter and exit the house you risk coming back to the wrong version of it Which would explain Amir and Laurie's weird behavior They came to the dinner late and they probably walked through the Darkzone which is why they remember things differently they are from a different version of the house So after the group reads the book and discuss its contents. This is what they conclude: That there are an infinite number of realities with their own versions of the group and the houses with an infinite number of differences which is why one group has blue glowsticks while the other has red glowsticks With that being said, as soon as the comet passes each reality is stuck, permanently, with whoever stays in there there's no going back home because it's locked off From every other reality From here on things get complicated and difficult to track but let's see if you guys can keep track with me and the characters in the movie So Mike told the group that he saw Amir, Hugh and Lee from the window when he was outside, creeping on and peeking on into the other house In this house, Lee is napping so the group thinks that maybe the Beth in the other house is currently sleeping which means: this other house doesn't have the book since they didn't have the conversation with Beth since Beth in the other house was asleep and then Mike has a private talk with Kevin and tells him (Kevin) that he (Mike) is going to blackmail his other self from stopping the other group from getting the book that's in the car and Mike leaves in spite of Kevin trying to stop him. Now Hugh and Amir in this house now, realise that they are in the wrong house Since they have red glowsticks and they see that in this house the blue glow stick box is opened, and leave after stealing the box and the book. Emily overhears Beth asks Lee where she bought this plant. "Oh, got it from Galaxy, that thrift store" The same way it happened earlier near the beginning of the film. and now Emily realizes that when she left outside with Kevin, Mike, and Laurie, they most have already come back to a different house. So someone from another version of the house breaks one of the car windows, and the group checks their cars to see if anything was stolen. Emily wanders off to her car and puts on a ring that Kevin once gave to her. Only to run into another version of Kevin near her car because when Emily asks Kevin about Hugh's car this Kevin has no idea what she's talking about and after they realize this, they both slowly walk away from each other Once group is back inside, they hear someone at the doorstep and it's Hugh and Amir who came back from the other house and they start telling the group, their story, which is basically the same story that was told earlier by the red glowstick version of Hugh and Amir and Lee points out that this version of Hugh is wearing a different bandaid from the one that she gave the other Hugh So our group makes their own version of the box Why? As a marker It's full of objects and information that's unique and relevant to them So if they ever get lost, they can check the box and see if they are at the right house So with all this said, this probably means that some houses do have boxes already while some definitely don't Then there's a knock at the door and a note appears It\xe2\x80\x99s Mike\xe2\x80\x99s blackmail note. The note reads \xe2\x80\x9cBeth + book = Trinidad club don't let it happen buddy\xe2\x80\x9d basically Mike and Beth had an affair 12 years ago and Mike in many if not all realities must have thought that blackmailing himself was a good plan and Hugh finds this note, and when he finds this out he realizes what it means (the letter) and gets super pissed and he punches Mike. Everything is falling apart in this house. People are freaking out They're not sure if they belong. Not sure of whose 'who and everyone's losing their minds and Emily is just fed up with all this chaos and confusion and all this suffering Emily, decides to leave the house, walking through the Dark Zone. Where she peeks into different versions of the house, hoping to find her way home or at least somewhere better since in a lot of the alternate realities People are fighting and arguing. Until she finds one perfect home where the group decided to chill inside and just enjoy themselves and Emily sneaks into this house and takes their tranquilizers before sneaking out Inside, this version of the group hear something crack and walk outside to find the windshield of Hugh\xe2\x80\x99s car, shattered. This version of Emily checks her own vehicle putting on the ring that Kevin won for her only to have our Emily sneak up from behind and drug her with a ketamine soaked napkin. and after drugging the second Emily, our Emily puts the second Emily in the trunk of the car takes her jacket and leaves taking her jacket and pretending to be this other Emily when she goes back inside and although agitated, tries to fit in without anyone noticing AND Lee notices and wonders why Emily was taking so long. Emily explains that she was admiring the comet and so the group go on the veranda to watch the comet pass by. But inside, Emily hears a noise and turns around to see her other self, crawling to the bathroom. and our Emily goes in and locks the door behind her, and smashes the drugged Emily's face Hiding the body in the shower tub, cleaning up the bloodstains, and after realizing she's lost her own ring takes the other Emily\xe2\x80\x99s ring. Never noticing her own original one on the floor. As soon as she leaves the bathroom, she faints. She wakes up the next morning on the couch and everything seems normal. None of the craziness from last night seems to have followed her. Emily even checks the bathroom only to find Beth come out, with no sign that the body was in the bathtub. Emily goes outside to find Hugh\xe2\x80\x99s car windshield cracked and the book about quantum physics still in his car and that's when Kevin sees her and gives her back her ring. As she takes the ring back, Kevin gets a call. Its from Emily's phone He answers the phone call and listens. Staring with suspicion at our Emily. So you\xe2\x80\x99re probably wondering what happened right? Well, "Our Emily", who we shall call \xe2\x80\x9cEmily-1\xe2\x80\x9d, drugged the second Emily, who we shall call Emily-2. and my theory is that sometime during the night, Emily 2 snuck out and that's why there's no body in the bathtub: She lived The next morning Emily-2 calls Kevin using her phone that in this reality, never broke, and Kevin, now listening to the phone call now knows that the Emily in front of him, is not 'his Emily'' and now he's sure that something happened between the two of them So Emily-2 is lucky enough to stay in her home reality, where she was almost killed by Emily-1 But that\xe2\x80\x99s what I think, tell me your theories in the comments down below and with that being said, thank you so much for watching, ladies &amp; gentlemen.
