hi everyone. its definition here with the Aquaman Justice League. saw a legion of collectors box. we're gonna say, if the box of this is better than the Justice League box office, see what I did there, kids. so anyway, we're opening it up. got you Justice League lads on Scott man, and it's got Wonder Woman. it's got Superman. what's why does it look so funny? we've got got Steppenwolf one, which I'm really happy with. he looks better than he did in the movie. and you're having that cause of the Aquaman one. yeah, that's all right. in it's got a weird, got weird background on it. you want to just look over Matt over here on our wall, I've got all my Funko pops here. so I'm building up quite a collection of crap. you probably know this. oh, that's what the straws for. it was gonna be the last straw. when I seen that it was a strong box. so a Wonder Woman cut. so, yeah, quite happy with that. so I must dash and you get it cuz you like you had a mustache. check out my next video. thanks very much. take care. boots.
