Otis\xe2\x80\x99 best friend is Eric, the gay son of a religious Ghanian-Nigerian family. Otis\xe2\x80\x99 crush is Maeve Wiley, an intelligent outcast whose rough family life leads to self-destructive tendencies. There\xe2\x80\x99s also Jackson Marchetti, the headboy at Moordale who struggles to just be a kid amidst the lofty expectations placed on him by his parents. Adam Groff is the headmaster\xe2\x80\x99s son who bullies the other students due to his own insecurities and the extreme pressures of his father. Aimee Gibbs is member of the popular mean girls clique \xe2\x80\x9cThe Untouchables\xe2\x80\x9d, but secretly she\xe2\x80\x99s best friends with Maeve and a people pleaser to the point of it being a detriment to herself. Other members of the Untouchables include Ruby, Olivia, and Anwar, the only other openly gay guy at Moordale, and the crush of Eric. And then there\xe2\x80\x99s Lily, an eccentric writer of alien erotica who desperately wants to lose her virginity. Throughout season 1, Otis develops a crush on Maeve and the two decide to start a sex therapy clinic to help the various sex and relationship problems of the students at Moordale. Otis is using knowledge he\xe2\x80\x99s picked up over the years from his sex therapist mother, while Maeve is running the business side of things, needing the money to help pay her rent as her parents and older brother are absent from her life. The clinic ends up becoming a huge success, and Otis helps many students along the way. He teaches Aimee to be her own person and to pursue and communicate her own thoughts and feelings instead of living for others. This eventually leads to Aimee breaking up with her Untouchables friend group and publicly siding with Maeve. She also breaks up with her bully of a boyfriend Adam and eventually ends up with nice guy Steve. He also helps Lily come to terms with both her obsession and internal anxieties over losing her virginity.

That relationship is short-lived, as the perpetual screw-up Adam is shipped off to military school by his father. Jackson strikes up a relationship with Maeve, thanks in large part to some unwitting advice from Otis, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a huge breakthrough for Jackson in simply allowing himself to be a teenager. Instead of living his life revolved around swim meets and practices, he can party and experience young love. Unfortunately, try as she might, Maeve doesn\xe2\x80\x99t reciprocate those feelings and by the end of the season her and Jackson break up. Maeve spent the season trying to better herself and refocus on her academics. Her writing skills could earn her university scholarships, and an essay she wrote for Adam even ends up winning an award. But those newfound successes could all come grinding to a halt when her troublemaking brother returns home. After he\xe2\x80\x99s caught selling drugs at the school dance, Headmaster Groff believes that Maeve and Otis\xe2\x80\x99 clinic is actually a drug ring and moves to have Maeve expelled.
