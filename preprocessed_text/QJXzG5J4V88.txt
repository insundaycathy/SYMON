welcome. my name is lisa, and now i'm going to talk about the last days on mars. [Music]. in the 2040s, a martian research base, tantalus based outpost is established. the eight-person crew who have been stationed there for six months is only 19 hours from the completion of their research mission. the spacecraft aurora is inbound from earth and will collect the team bylander mars. scientist marco petrovic has found samples that point to life on the planet. without revealing his discovery, he devises a ruse for a last diva on the surface. crewmate richard harrington drives petrovic in a solar-powered rover to the spot where he had found the sample. after he obtains soil with the biological agent present, petrovic falls into a fissure that suddenly opens. it is it is captain charles brunell and crewmate lauren dalby plan to explore the pit to retrieve petrovic's body. dalby remains at the pit, but disappears before the team can return with equipment. brunel authorizes vincent campbell to explore the pit, and he finds that a fungal organism is present in the fissure. dolphy and petrovic reappear at the main outpost, but exposure to the organism has altered them into fast, aggressive, intelligent zombie-like creatures with blackened skin and no trace of their original personalities. harrington dies from a power drill attack by one of the zombies and later revives as one himself. the remaining crew hold off the zombies while brunel and campbell return. brunel is also fatally injured and reanimates, which provides the crew with new insight into the symptoms thirst, memory loss and aggression. after several fights and escapes from the zombies through the habitat modules mission, psychologist robert irwin trapped scientist kim aldrich, who had often infuriated her crewmates. rebecca lane is also stabbed in the leg. during the frantic escape to a rover. with their rover's power low, the survivors, campbell, erwin and lane decide they must get to the other rover, which is still at the site of the fissure. under the pretense of a scouting operation, erwin steals the second rover and fails to persuade campbell to abandon lane, who he states as infected. erwin meanwhile, conceals evidence of his possible infection. while campbell and lane wait for the sun to rise in the solar powered batteries to recharge, they discuss the nature of the zombies, and lane questions whether any human consciousness remains trapped in them. campbell attempts to comfort her and falls asleep. when he wakes up alone, campbell realizes that lane has fled into the desert, and he chases her. lane, who knows she is likely to turn, fails to deter campbell from following her, and in desperation, commits suicide by removing her helmet. after she dies, lane reanimates and begs campbell to destroy her. campbell reluctantly complies by bashing her head in with a rock. campbell and irwin separately converge on the aurora lander, where the reanimated aldrich kills the lander's crew petrovic and the other zombies appear, desiccated and inert. an infected irwin initiates a launch, which takes him and campbell into orbit. campbell stuns irwin and ejects the body and virulent blood droplets into the vacuum of space. in a message to mission control, campbell says he does not have enough fuel for a rendezvous, but supplies a board can last for months. if they want to launch a rescue. he tells them that this might not be advisable as he could be infected. if so, he has just enough fuel for re-entry and a fast death. campbell concludes that it will take 15 minutes for the transmission to be received, and will await their reply. he subsequently ends the communication, still floating alone in space. thank you all for watching. don't forget to subscribe and hit the bell notification for more of these videos.
