devastating tsunamis to coastal cities, killing even more people. the third wave has the others modifying the avian flu, which infects people like lisbeth and even lisa. cassie, sam and oliver bury lisa in the front yard of their house and say goodbye to her. the three head to a survivor's camp. after a few days of residing in the camp, a large cloud of dust forms, and from it emerged military

oliver. cassie mourns her father and proceeds to move forward on her own. the kids arrive at camp haven, a military training facility. van and sam are among those that are recruited. they are given new nicknames as well. ben is zombie and samus nugget. ben meets sergeant resnick. she injects a tracker in the back of his neck and sits him down in front of a two-way mirror where a boy is snared up to a chair. resnick says the boy is really another she shows ben through a lens that the boy has a green skull, then gives ben a button to kill the boy. resnick sees that ben is wearing his dead sister's necklace, using it as motivation to push ben to press the button which he does. cassie carries a gun that her father gave her before he died. she arrives at the abandoned convenience store in the opening scene and is forced to shoot and kill the wounded man. as seen before. next we see that cassie walks through an abandoned freeway littered with many abandoned cars and sees many dead

start their training. he befriends another kid named dumbo, and they are presented with a girl called ringer, who is tough and takes crap from no one. she is an excellent shot, and she teaches the kids how to shoot. after ben takes her down during training, cassie wakes up to find herself in the care of a young man named evan walker. he tends to her gunshot wound. cassie wants to leave and find sam, but evan warns her that it would be dangerous for her to go out there on her own without protection. cassie discovers that evan took her gun and hit it. she runs away, but sets off one of his traps in the woods. evan runs back to her and protects her. as someone else with a gun is walking through the woods. at camp haven, colonel vosh brings ben into the control center and tells him that

someone's gun and incapacitate them. she shows him pictures of the people she used to know and love before the invasion. quickly, cassie and evan develop an attraction for each other. the kids are brought to a location where others have been detected. they spot a number of people with green skulls and fire at them. however, they then see ringer through their lens and see a green skull. before anyone can shoot her, ben stops them. he is spotted with a green skull too. he quickly realizes that voice and resnick lied to them, and that they are really others. the fifth wave is the kids
