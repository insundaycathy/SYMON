oh, ho hoes in different area codes. its definition. here. this time I've got a Z box from zabi. it is nineteen town normally, but they reduced the first box of ten pounds. so I thought I'd check it out. then she Kelly, cancel it. cancel that. I'm not paying twenty quid for this crap. open it. got another stormtrooper. if you've been watching me series, every single time I get a fungal box, it's a bloody storm trooper in it. off you go with eBay. make you going straight on. that one t-shirt here. I'm serenity. did really like serenity that much, so that can go on eBay as well. got a little Star Wars flats. it's a little trouble mug. I tell you who the mug is for. buy a net hoodie, mate. so, I was little table. ha. I mean, fair enough if you want to, if you want to tell people you like Star Wars, not round here, because he'll probably get beat. you know what about the said box, exclusive hit or know what that is? it's got Tom Cruise in so, I mean, you can't go wrong with that. so that'll be the last Jedi buy that box. that didn't make sense, but that'll be the last time I buy it. was a very unimpressed with that. but, you know, a lot of stuff to go on ebay. I'll probably make about five quid off it. so thanks very much. I give that box a four out of ten. I'll see you next time. take care. Pete,
