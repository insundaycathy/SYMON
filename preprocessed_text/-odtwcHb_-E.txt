Welcome to Cinema Summary, ladies and gentlemen; now today I wanted to talk about a film that I feel like a lot of people got right but not all of it and I wanted to clear up any misconceptions that you or other people might have about it and I have to give thanks to users Quaker Joy, Kate Kim, TN and Blackout for the points made throughout this video and the topics of today's video are gonna be about the Japanese stranger \xe2\x80\x93the old man\xe2\x80\x93, Moo-Myeong the mushrooms, the deleted ending as well as Il-Gwang, and the photos but first here's a very brief and very quick summary of The Wailing (2016) So there's a Japanese man who has recently arrived to this quite little Korean town in the mountains, living by his lonesome in the woods but since he's arrived things have gotten weird a terrible and mysterious illness is spreading throughout the town infecting townspeople with a rash and a terrifying urge to kill ending fatally for both the victims and the murderer We followed Jong-Goo, a loving if indifferent father and police officer investigating these murders and in in his investigation he encounters a strange woman in white named Moo-Myeong Who directs him to investigate the Japanese stranger who haunts Jong-Goo's dreams... however during the course of his investigation. Several things happen For one, Jong-Goo finds evidence that the Japanese guy is a killer; finding photographs of the murdered victims\xe2\x80\x93they find photographic evidence that points towards the Japanese guy being a killer and secondly Jong-Goo's daughter Hyo-Jin becomes possessed by an evil spirit so Jong-Goo hires a lavishly dressed exorcist named Il-Gwang to exorcise her which doesn't go well and it's then later that Jong-Goo and his friends have a terrifying encounter with an honest-to-god zombie and they end up killing the Japanese man believing him to be the cause of the curse and it's only later that Il-Gwang convinces Jong-Goo that no, it's not the Japanese man that's the cause of this it's in fact the woman in white: Moo-Myeong and Il-Gwang himself actually runs into Moo-Myeong and has a terrifying encounter vomiting up copious amounts of blood and flees the town only to return when he's terrorized by a swarm of locusts and ultimately, the film ends with us finding out that Moo-Myeong and the Japanese guy are some sort of supernatural entity with Moo-Myeong being a "good guy" and the Japanese guy being the Devil So by the end of the film it's heavily implied that the old man is now a demon or the Devil himself however earlier in the film it's actually the demon or the devil who is possessing the body of the Japanese stranger however every so often the demon either relinquishes control or the Japanese guy's spirit actively fights for control over his own body which allows the Japanese man to perform that ritual which is meant to drive the demon from his body into the body of Mr. Park. the cadaver in the photo and Moo-myeong's presence helps drive the demon out of his body as well allowing this Japanese stranger to reclaim total control over his body which is why he acts so differently after being chased after that whole scene (The ritual). He's no longer possessed by the demon however he dies sometime after falling onto the truck and being pushed off the highway by Jong-Goo allowing the demon or the Devil to fully possess the body of the Japanese stranger and we see its true form at the end of the movie as the priest \xe2\x80\x93 a character I didn't mention in the summary \xe2\x80\x93 fully acknowledges and believes in the supernatural status of the creature which brings me to a few othe points Moo-myeong and belief Now this movie combines aspects of Christianity and Korean shamanism, all of it embodied in Moo-Myeong who I'm pretty sure is some sort of land God or local guardian spirit of the town meant to protect it and in fact some of her actions actually references the Bible she throws stones at Jong-Goo which is a reference to John Chapter 8 Verse 7 "He who is without sin, may cast he first stone" referring to Jong-Goo as a pure man who doesn't easily give in to sinful desire having no sex drive, not eating a lot, working 'hard enough', and not being lazy as well as being willing to spend a lot of money for the sake of his daughter she also references the rooster crowing 3 times, which is a reference to John Chapter 18 where Peter denies knowing Jesus three times which heralds the crucifixion of Christ but in the movie this manifests itself as Jong-Goo refusing to believe Moo-Myeong spiel about trapping the demon and this ends up getting him killed by Hyo-Jin now possessed by another demon (spirit) implying that Moo-Myeong's powers work on faith and that if you have faith and you believe you will and can be protected but if you were to ever waver in your faith and sin, bad things will happen to you and depending on what you believe in bad things will happen to you as the priest finds out the end of the movie when he confronts the devil Now  something that is mentioned earlier in the film is that there are these mushrooms that were consumed by the victims of the mysterious disease with the mushrooms contributing symptoms of paranoia, rashes, and murderous intent leading to a misconception that the movie's plot was kick-started by a case of fungal infections in other words there's a theory that this movie is just a hallucination by Jong-Goo and I wish to debunk this and I will admit there are several scenes where the people in the village do eat something that might have been contaminated by the mushrooms and although it would explain a lot of the weird things that happen in this film and Jong-Goo's sudden change in demeanor as a result of hallucinations or a fever dream on Jong-Goo's part but it doesn't adequately explain very supernatural aspects of this film it doesn't explain how an ostensibly dead Japanese man comes back to life nor does explain how lightning comes out of nowhere to strike some random guy in the middle of the woods nor does it explain how there are locusts of a highway or the fact that the protective garland\xe2\x80\x93that charm that Moo-Myeong hangs over Jong-Goo's gate ends up rotting as soon as Jong-Goo crosses the threshold and the cherry on top is that there was a deleted ending that depicts Il-Gwang and the Japanese stranger getting into a car and driving off with Moo-Myeong looking on clearly distraught more or less confirming my suspicions that she's in fact a land God who's restricted to protecting those in her territory which is why she can't chase after Il-Gwang and the demon So Il-Gwang is the exorcist that was hired to expel the spirit possessing Hyo-Jin, Jong-Hoo's daughter however Il-Gwang isn't as benevolent as he seems Yes! He might be a good shaman, in fact Jong-Goo paid top dollar for his services Il-Gwang isn\'t a "good" shaman If you catch my drift because throughout the movie we see him do things that aren't so befitting of someone of his station: he swears and he wears extravagant clothing even though he prays to Buddha and some the tenants of traditional Buddhism is to not be extravagant, be a civil person (don't swear) and do not kill living things but what do we see we see him wear brand-name clothing, we see him get paid an exorbitant amount of money to do the ritual and he swears and of course he kills a chicken to do his ritual hinting at his less than holy nature but there are hints that he's aligned with the Japanese shaman / demon he wears a very familiar fundoshi, the underwear that he Japanese man wears the throughout the film and then later he changes into darker clothing after the ritual hinting at his two-faced nature and he even violently vomits a blood when he\'s near the "holy" Moo-Myeong, getting rid of his impurity so to speak and he tries to run away but he's frightened back into helping the demon after the demon sends a horde of locusts after his car So the kicker is that at the end of the film, we see Il-Gwang gather a set of photos that the Japanese man claimed to have burned; photos of the dead victims which are gathered up and put back into the trunk of his car before driving off Why do these photos matter? Well, for 1) they're a major source of evidence that points towards the Japanese man being the cause of the murders and mysterious deaths around the village but there's an old belief in some cultures and that cameras are able to capture your soul in their photographs thus these photos are either the physical representation or a manifestation of the captured souls that were taken by the demon who has enlisted the help of Il-Gwang in collecting these Souls this explains why he takes a photo of Jong-Goo at the end of the film and why he has all those photos and the purpose of his ritual: his ritual wasn't to get rid of the evil spirit possessing Hyo-Jin it was to get rid of Hyo-Jin's spirit which was fighting against the ritual as she begs her father, her "abeoji" (daddy) a word she hasn't used since she's been possessed to stop the ritual which although is stopped ultimately fails to stop the full possession of Hyo-Jin With that being said thank you so much for watching, ladies and gentlemen if you enjoyed it, leave a like down below and subscribe to get updated on my latest uploads and don't forget to have some faith or else the Devil is gonna kill you
