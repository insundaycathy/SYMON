we have watched how one moment, one choice, can ripple across space and time, giving birth to new stories. after losing his girlfriend, christine palmer, in a car crash, grief stricken, strange sought answers across the world and mystic arts, the eye of akamoto. he travels to camertaj, learns and becomes a master of mystic arts. he discovers the eye of agamotto, which can manipulate and alter timelines. but he is warned by the ancient one and wong that doing so could destroy the reality. two years later, strange still could not let go of the past. he repeatedly uses the eye of agamotto to save christine palmer, but she still dies every single time. [Music]. the ancient one tells strange that christine's death is an absolute point in time and that it cannot be undone. but strange refuse to listen. the ancient one drew upon the power of the dark dimension and splits the timeline. thereby splitting strange, allowing two of his possible timelines to occur in one universe. one of them accepts christine's death, while the other hide it in the past, growing stronger and more powerful by absorbing the magic of mystical beings. [Music]. in the end, the evil version overpowers the other, strange, and both becomes one again. strange resurrects his girlfriend, christine, tearing reality apart. [Music], the resulting temporal paradox destroys the universe. strange begs the watcher for help, but he says that he can't interfere. meddling with time and events only leads to more destruction. christine disintegrates, leaving strange supreme to grieve alone. i'm sorry.
