[Music]. within the DC. superhero dimension in the Lego universe, Batman continues to protect Gotham City and fight crime. during his latest mission to stop the Joker from destroying the city, he hurts his feelings by telling him he is not as important in his life as he thinks he is, leading Joker to seek the ultimate revenge on him. the following day, Batman's alter-ego, Bruce Wayne, attends the city's winter gala, which is celebrating both the retirement of Commissioner Gordon and the Ascension of his daughter, Barbara Gordon, as the city's new police commissioner, only to be infuriated by Barbara's plans to restructure the police to function without the need of Batman. without warning, Joker crashes the party with the city's other villains, all of whom surrender, with the exception of Harley Quinn, who disappears during the confusion. suspecting his arch rivals up to something, Batman plots to steal Superman's Phantom Zone projector, a device that can banish anyone to the Phantom Zone, which houses some of the most dangerous villains in the lego multiverse. just as he plans his heist of the device. Alfred intervenes and advises him to take care of Dick Grayson, whom Bruce unintentionally adopted as his ward during the gala. reluctantly agreeing to do so, Batman fosters Dick as Robin, whereupon the pair successfully recovered the projector from the fortress of solitude and break into Arkham Asylum to send Joker to the Phantom Zone. suspecting that the Joker wanted to be sent there, Barbara locks up Batman and Robin for their reckless actions. while the projector is being seized as evidence, Harley steals it back as part of Joker's plan and frees him, allowing him to return to Gotham with all the villains he had recruited in the Phantom Zone, realizing that the city does need him, Barbara releases Batman and Robin and teams up with them and Alfred to stop the Joker. although Batman finds himself able to trust and rely on his new team, upon reaching Wayne island, he chooses to send them away rather than losing them like his parents. upon facing him alone, Joker believes that Batman is incapable of change and saps into the Phantom Zone before stealing the Batcave stash of confiscated bombs. arriving in the Phantom Zone, Batman witnesses the harm his selfishness has caused everyone and slowly accepts his greatest fear, making a deal with the zones gatekeeper, Phylis, a talking Lego brick to be allowed back to Gotham in order to retrieve the zones escaped prisoners. Batman arrives in time to save his teammates, apologizing to them for his actions and requesting their help to stop Joker. realizing that Joker plans to use the explosives he took to destroy the city's energy facility, thus causing the city to come apart and be destroyed, Batman turns Barbara into Batgirl, before he his team and Gotham City's other villains, who felt neglected by Joker, managed to successfully send the escaped villains back to the Phantom Zone. however, the group failed to stop Joker's bombs from going off. as the explosion begins to tear the city apart at the plates beneath it, knowing this was his fault, Batman reluctantly convinced his Joker that he is the true reason for being here. he is before they their friends and allies and the city's inhabitants, chain linked themselves together and pull the plates back together, saving the city. with the city saved, Batman prepares to be taken back into the Phantom Zone to fulfill his bargain, only to be rejected by Phyllis, who chooses to let him remain after seeing how much she had changed in order to save everyone. afterwards, Batman allows Joker and the rest of his rogues to temporarily escape with the confidence that whenever they return, there will be no match for Batman and his family.
