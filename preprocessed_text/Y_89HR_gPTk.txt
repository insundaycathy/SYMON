hello. my name is Steven, and today I'm going to talk about The Twilight Saga, New Moon. on her 18th birthday, Bella Swan awakens from a dream where she is an old woman, and Edward Cullen, her immortal vampire boyfriend, is forever 17 years old. despite her lack of enthusiasm, Edwards family hosts a small birthday party for Bella. while unwrapping a gift, Bella receives a paper cut. Edwards foster brother, Jasper, overwhelmed by the scent of Bella's blood, attempts to attack her, but his restraint, believing that he and his family are putting Bella's life in danger, it would ends their relationship. and the Cullens leave Forks. Bella is left severely depressed and isolated for months. her concerned father, Charlie, wants Bella to live with her mother in Jacksonville, Florida. Bella refuses and promises to spend more time with her school friends. and she and Jessica see a movie. after Bella approaches some rough-looking bikers outside the theatre, much to Jessica's consternation. the dicey encounter reminds Bella of a previous near assault where Edward rescued her. she imagines seeing and hearing Edward, and realizes that thrill-seeking activities can evoke his preserved image. Bella's Quileute friend, Jacob black, helps ease her pain by engaging her in various activities. jacob mentions how many of his tribal friends are now controlled by sam and other Quileute while attending a movie with Bella and Mike. Jacob abruptly leaves after becoming inexplicably angry and suffering a burning fever. Bella drives to Jacobs home after he avoids seeing her. Jacob has cut his long hair and now has the same Quileute tattoo on his upper right arm as Sam and other tribe members. when Bella hikes to the meadow that she and Edward often visited, she is confronted by Victoria's vampire companion, Lauren. as he is about to kill her, a wolf pack appears and attack him. Bella eventually discovers that Jacob and the other tribe members are shapeshifters who phase into giant wolves, their age-old enemy of vampires, though it treaty exists between the Cullens and the tribe Jacob's pack members are currently on alert for Victoria, the vampire seeking to avenge her mate, James, who Edward killed to protect Bella. with Jacob focused on adapting to his new shape-shifting powers, Bella again finds herself alone and returns to seeking thrill inducing activities, deliberately oblivious to Victoria's presence through a series of miscommunications. Edward beliefs that Bella has killed herself after Alice has a vision of Bella jumping off a seaside cliff. distraught, Edward travels to Italy to ask the Volturi, a powerful coven that act as vampiric overlords, to end his life, as he is incapable of doing this himself. when they refuse his request, he plans to force their hand by exposing himself as a vampire to humans during a large festival. meanwhile, Alice, Edwards sister, returns to Forks and his shot that Bella is alive. Alice and Bella traveled to Italy to save Edward, arriving in time to prevent his revealing himself as a vampire. Edward, relieved Bella is alive, explains he only left Forks to protect her, and promises never to leave again. impressed by a human's willingness to sacrifice her life for a vampire, the Volturi determined the fella who knows that vampires exist must neither be killed or be transformed into a vampire.
