Story Recapped here. Today, I'm going to explain a horror, sci-fi, thriller film called \xe2\x80\x9cExistenz.\xe2\x80\x9d Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care. Ted is an intern at Antenna Research, the world\xe2\x80\x99s leading game manufacturer. He\xe2\x80\x99s manning the door at a game developer conference where a small crowd is gathered at what appears to be a small church. Antenna\xe2\x80\x99s renowned game designer, Allegra Geller, introduces her latest creation. The crowd listens excitedly as Allegra discusses her new game, Existenz, and how it would be the next groundbreaking game of the decade. Players would plug into their consoles, called game pods, and enter a virtual-reality world. The consoles they use appear to be made of organic material that looks like a blob of flesh. These are then plugged into their bodies at the base of their spines via an umbilical cord, also made of flesh. Several audience members are then selected to join Allegra in Existenz. A tardy audience member arrives, and Ted checks his belongings using a metal detector for any concealed weapons or recording equipment. He comes out clean, and he then joins the audience. The volunteers and Allegra then enter Existenz, going into a dream-like state. The newly-arrived audience member suddenly stands up and points a gun at Allegra. He walks up to her, proclaiming he would end Allegra Geller, calling her a demoness. He shoots but only hits Allegra\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder. The crowd scrambles and other security officers draw their guns and shoot the man repeatedly. Ted sees the man\xe2\x80\x99s gun, noticing that it looks as if it had been made out of bone and ligaments. Regardless, he arms himself with it and runs to Allegra, escorting her out. They get into a car and drive into the countryside. Ted asks Allegra if she knows what to do, and Allegra says she didn\xe2\x80\x99t even know people wanted her dead. Allegra says the countryside is full of game developers, and Ted finds hope, saying someone could help them. Ted gets a phone call from Antenna, but Allegra grabs his phone and throws it out the window, saying whoever wants her dead could track their location through his phone. Allegra thinks they\xe2\x80\x99d be better off remaining in hiding as they don\xe2\x80\x99t know who they could trust. They pull over to the side of the road, and Ted tries removing the bullet in Allegra\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder. He fishes out the projectile and sees that it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a bullet that penetrated her but a tooth. They take a look at the strange bone pistol again and see that the bullets in the magazine are teeth. Ted notes that the gun is made entirely out of organic material, the perfect weapon for evading a metal detector. They arrive at a motel, and Allegra walks up to Ted and tries to feel up his back, looking for Ted\xe2\x80\x99s bio port. The bio port is a hole at the base of the spine where the game pod\xe2\x80\x99s umbilical cord connects to. Ted says he never got a bio port installed. Allegra is surprised and realizes Ted must have never played any virtual reality games his whole life since he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a bio port. Ted says he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like the feeling of having something penetrating his body. Allegra says having bio ports installed is safe and straightforward, citing how people even do it in malls, but Ted counters, saying there\xe2\x80\x99s also a chance of permanent spinal paralysis. Allegra laughs this off, telling Ted he\xe2\x80\x99s missing out on a lot. Allegra then takes her game pod and tells Ted it had been damaged during the panic at the church. She says she needs to enter the game as soon as possible to see if it has been corrupted. She would need the help of another individual to enter the game with her to see if the game still works. Ted agrees, and they head to a gas station to have an illegal bio port inserted in him. At the gas station, they meet the attendant, Gas, who recognizes Allegra and decides to help. Gas confesses that Allegra\xe2\x80\x99s games have changed his life by providing him an escape from the mundaneness. Ted and Gas head in while Allegra looks around outside. She then sees a strange two-headed mutated creature, admiring it and caressing it. She heads back inside and sees Ted keeping Gas at bay, afraid to have the bio port installed. Allegra steps in, trying to convince Ted to proceed. As she tries to talk Ted into it, Gas shoots Ted with the port installer, causing Ted to fall on his face. Ted panics, saying he can\xe2\x80\x99t feel his legs, but Gas calms him down, saying it\xe2\x80\x99s only temporary. Allegra is excited to enter the game and plugs the game pod\xe2\x80\x99s umbilical cords into herself and Ted. She turns the game pod on, but the pod sparks and short circuits. Allegra is infuriated, blaming Ted for destroying her pod, but Ted argues he did nothing wrong. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel anything, nor did he do anything to influence the pod. Nevertheless, Allegra is distraught, saying her pod is the sole game pod that contains the only copy of Existenz. She poured years of her life and millions of dollars developing the game, and now it\xe2\x80\x99s stuck inside a defective game pod. Ted apologizes but tells her that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t do anything wrong, maintaining he felt nothing from when she turned the pod on. Gas then walks in, agreeing with Ted while pointing a shotgun at them. Gas reveals a five million dollar bounty on Allegra\xe2\x80\x99s head, and he\xe2\x80\x99s keen on collecting the reward for himself. He also reveals that he had intentionally installed a defective bio port into Ted to short out the game as there\xe2\x80\x99s also a reward for destroying Existenz. Allegra tries to dissuade Gas, saying the people who want her dead would never pay him the money and could even kill him too. Ted then grabs the bio port installer and shoots Gas through the neck. Gas falls to the floor, lifeless. After two close calls with assassins, Allegra decides to visit Kiri Vinokur, a game pod engineer. Ted spots the same two-headed creature, and Allegra says it\xe2\x80\x99s probably a mutated salamander frog lizard thing. They both shrug it off and enter Kiri\xe2\x80\x99s cabin. Kiri welcomes them in and tells Allegra he\xe2\x80\x99s heard of the rumors surrounding Allegra\xe2\x80\x99s bounty and assures them they\xe2\x80\x99ll be safe in his house. Allegra hands Kiri her shorted-out game pod, and Kiri begins work on it. Kiri and his assistant assess the game pod\xe2\x80\x99s condition meticulously while Ted watches. Ted notes that the game pod looks like an animal, and Kiri laughs, saying the game pods might as well be animals. They are created from special tissue grown from genetically modified amphibians and mixed with synthetic D.N.A. Kiri repairs Allegra\xe2\x80\x99s pod successfully, noting how lucky she is, seeing how the game doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be corrupted. Kiri then replaces Ted\xe2\x80\x99s bio port and inserts a functioning one. Allegra and Ted head back to the motel, and they finally plug back into Allegra\xe2\x80\x99s game pod. Almost instantly, they\xe2\x80\x99re transported into Existenz. Ted is in awe, being inside a virtual reality game for the first time. Ted asks how they\xe2\x80\x99re supposed to play and what the objectives are, but Allegra tells him they have to play the game to find out. They look around and find a smaller version of the game pod, a micro pod. A store owner, Nader, tells them the micro pod is a brand new gaming architecture from Cortical Systematics, Antenna\xe2\x80\x99s equivalent in-game. They follow Nader to a secluded area, and Ted suddenly gets intimidating and is taken aback by his sudden urge to be mean. Allegra tells him it\xe2\x80\x99s part of the game as the game would sometimes make them do or say things their characters are supposed to. Ted continues, and Nader recommends they use the micro pods. Nader leaves, and Allegra comments that Nader\xe2\x80\x99s interactions are a little lacking, making a note to rework him. They use the micro pods, and as Ted inserts the micro pod into Allegra, he kisses Allegra\xe2\x80\x99s bio port. Allegra pushes him back, and Ted says it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t him but his game character. Allegra then kisses Ted, and the two start making out. Allegra assumes it must be part of their character\xe2\x80\x99s stories. Ted tries to stop, worried about his physical body. Allegra assures him that their bodies are fine, and they\xe2\x80\x99d get pulled out of the game if anything were to go wrong. They continue kissing, and Ted suddenly finds himself in a filthy warehouse filled with bloody conveyor belts, workers lined on all sides busy disemboweling mutated amphibians. A game character, Nourish, tells Ted they\xe2\x80\x99re at a trout farm, farming all kinds of creatures and creating parts for game pods. Ted slices an amphibian open and starts separating its guts. Even he is surprised at the level of skill mastery he has and assumes it\xe2\x80\x99s his character\xe2\x80\x99s skills. Nourish then recommends Ted have lunch at a Chinese restaurant nearby and order the special. Ted agrees and heads down to look for Allegra. He finds Allegra and commends her game design, saying the factory looks dirty and grotesque, looking as close to the real thing as possible. They head into the Chinese restaurant and tell the waiter they want the special. Ted tells Allegra he wants to pause the game, but Allegra is surprised, asking Ted if he\xe2\x80\x99s not curious to find out more about the special. Ted says he\xe2\x80\x99s afraid he might lose touch with reality, but Allegra says this is only an effect of how well the game integrates with his brain. Ted suddenly stands up, shouts pause, and exits the game. They both awaken at the motel, and Allegra says she wants to go back into the game immediately, where there is intrigue and suspense. Ted is terrified, saying the reality they returned to is indistinguishable from the game world, making him wonder if they\xe2\x80\x99re still inside a game without knowing. Allegra kisses Ted, reassuring him that she\xe2\x80\x99s real, and they agree to go back into the game. The waiter returns, bringing the special, a large plate filled with all sorts of amphibians and reptiles, all mixed in a soup. Ted sees the two-headed creature they saw in the real world and gets the sudden urge to eat everything on the plate. Both are disgusted, but Ted, unable to control his actions, continues eating happily. He eats the flesh and skin off of the amphibians, leaving the bones. He starts assembling the bones, clicking them together until he forms the same bone pistol they found on Allegra\xe2\x80\x99s assailant. Ted takes a tooth bridge from his mouth and places it in as the gun\xe2\x80\x99s ammunition. He suddenly aims the weapon at Allegra\xe2\x80\x99s head, looking as if he\xe2\x80\x99s ready to pull the trigger, proclaiming death to the demoness. He stops himself, and Allegra passes it off as a joke but is visibly shaken. Ted apologizes and admits he has the urge to kill someone, pointing to the waiter. The waiter approaches their table, and Ted shoots. The waiter tries to fight back, but Ted fires again, destroying half of the man\xe2\x80\x99s face. Everyone in the restaurant is stunned, but Ted assures them everything is fine and tells them to continue their meals. The crowd complies and continues their lunches as if nothing happened. A dog picks up the bone gun and carries it away. Nourish appears and gestures for them to follow. Nourish congratulates them for killing the waiter, revealing that the waiter was a spy for Cortical Systematics. Nourish then tells them he\xe2\x80\x99s part of an underground organization called the Realists, a group dedicated to destroying Cortical Systematics for the crimes they\xe2\x80\x99ve committed against reality. He then tells them they must continue working in the company as they need more agents on the inside. Ted and Allegra return to the game store looking for Nader, but a different man, Hugo, is operating the cash register. Hugo leads them back, showing a dead Nader. Hugo shows them the bone gun that the Chinese waiter\xe2\x80\x99s dog had brought him. He reveals that the Chinese waiter was a Realist member, and Nourish and Nader are the spies working for Cortical Systems. Nader had known about Ted and Allegra\xe2\x80\x99s arrival and had successfully gotten them to assassinate their supposed contact to the Realist movement. Hugo then tasks them to head back to the factory to eliminate Nourish. They return to the trout farm and find a mangled rotting game pod, and Allegra says she has the urge to plug herself in. Ted warns the pod looks diseased, but Allegra dismisses him, plugging the pod into her. She turns the pod on and suddenly starts feeling pain. Ted cuts the umbilical cord, and Allegra starts bleeding out. Nourish steps in with a flamethrower and burns the diseased pod, proclaiming death to realism. The pod bursts open, and a massive amount of spores fill the air, infecting all the game pod parts in the factory. Allegra then stabs Nourish, and Nourish declares death to the demoness before falling. The flamethrower starts burning the building, and Ted and Allegra wake up safely back at the motel. Allegra says they\xe2\x80\x99ve somehow brought the disease back with them from Existenz, and it has now infected her game pod. Allegra tries remedying it by injecting medicine and notices Ted scratching his bio port. She examines Ted\xe2\x80\x99s bio port and realizes this is Kiri\xe2\x80\x99s doing. Allegra surmises Kiri must have given Ted an infected bio port, knowing Ted would plug into Allegra\xe2\x80\x99s pod, infecting it. Ted starts panicking, knowing he has an infected bio port, but Allegra takes action, inserting a plug into Ted\xe2\x80\x99s bio port to stop the infection. An explosion occurs, and Hugo from the game appears sporting camo pants and a firearm. Hugo shoots the pod, and Ted tells Allegra he thinks they\xe2\x80\x99re still in the game. They all rush out into a warzone with explosions and gunfire everywhere. Hugo tells them this is the Realist uprising, and they are here to stop Existenz and Antenna. Hugo aims the gun at Allegra, but Kiri shoots him. Ted and Allegra are in utter confusion, unsure if they\xe2\x80\x99ve exited the game or are still inside. Kiri runs to them with the bone gun in hand and tells them he made a copy of the game. He had replicated it during the surgery. He then tells Allegra to join him in defecting to Cortical Systematics, joining others from Antenna, but Allegra picks up Hugo\xe2\x80\x99s gun and shoots Kiri. Ted gets angry, taking the gun from Allegra, but Allegra tells him Kiri was only a game character, and she didn\xe2\x80\x99t like how he was confusing her. But Ted is concerned that they might no longer be in the game, and Allegra may have killed Kiri in real life. Ted then points the gun at Allegra, telling her that their ending up together was no accident. Allegra realizes Ted is part of the Realist movement all along, remembering how he didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a bio port installed. Ted confirms this, saying he only got the bio port to get closer to Allegra, to understand the person he intended to kill. Allegra then reveals she had suspected Ted to be her true assassin when he aimed the bone gun at her back at the restaurant. The plug she inserted in his bio port is a bomb, and she detonates it, blowing up Ted\xe2\x80\x99s spine. Allegra celebrates, saying she\xe2\x80\x99s won the game. Attachments suddenly appear on her head and hand, and before she knows it, she awakens back at the church with a group of volunteers. Characters in the game like the waiter, Kiri, Nader, Gas, Hugo, and Nourish are all present as volunteers. Nourish is revealed to be the game\xe2\x80\x99s designer, and Ted and Allegra are audience members who are also volunteers. The volunteers then share comments, criticisms, and ideas about the game, Trancendenz. Some give praise, others recall funny moments and laugh, and others express their excitement for the game\xe2\x80\x99s development. The volunteers all applaud Nourish and Nourish and his assistant step aside to talk about the game. Nourish expresses his concern that he\xe2\x80\x99s terrified of the game they just played, having concepts like assassinating a famous game designer, obviously a reference to him. Nourish suspects that the game may have picked up some of the volunteer\xe2\x80\x99s inner thoughts, thinking that one of them could want him dead. Ted and Allegra take their dog and approach Nourish, telling Nourish his game design is nothing like they\xe2\x80\x99ve ever seen before, concluding that Nourish is indeed the greatest game designer in the world. Ted then congratulates Nourish for being reality\xe2\x80\x99s greatest enemy. Ted and Allegra take guns out concealed on the dog and start firing at Nourish and the assistant. They fall to the floor, and Ted and Allegra shout death to the demon Nourish and death to Trancendenz. They then make their way to the door, aiming their guns at the man who played the waiter. He begs them not to shoot then asks if they\xe2\x80\x99re still playing a game. Ted and Allegra stare at him, puzzled, but don\xe2\x80\x99t answer.
