The Platform is a movie about a vertical self-management center, which is a fancy way of saying a prison in the shape of a tower. It\xe2\x80\x99s not exactly a prison though, we\xe2\x80\x99ll come back to that. Prisoners, I mean residents, are placed two per level, for 333 levels. At the core of the plot lies the platform, which is loaded with a king\xe2\x80\x99s feast worth of food every day, enough to keep all 333 levels alive if rationed appropriately. The platform is then sent down through a hole in the center of the tower to the peasants, level by level, top to bottom. Every month the residents are randomly placed on a different level. You could be at the top 1 month, the bottom the next month, or on the bottom 3 months in a row. As you can imagine, people at the top are respectful and humble and ration food for those below them, and those on the lower level are grateful and respectful to those below them as well. Everyone on all levels only takes what they need and are able to get enough calories and protein to survive for that month as well as enjoy a respectable morsel of dessert foods. Just kidding, The VSC is a sadistic hellhole that extracts and emphasizes the worst aspects and temptations of human behavior. People who find themselves at the top give little crap for those below them, or a lot in some cases.. They greedily consume as much as their bellies can hold, and leave no food or dignity for those below them, causing either suicide, starvation, or cannabalism. Why should they care for those below them, as the lower class has no recourse (can\xe2\x80\x99t crap upwards). And when the people on the top levels had been on the lower levels, nobody spared them, so why should they spare those who didn\xe2\x80\x99t spare them? It\xe2\x80\x99s a vicious cycle derived from the VSC\xe2\x80\x99s rules. If you woke up tomorrow on floor 48 of the tower of terror(?), what would you do, what could you do? In this video on Nerd Explains, I'll tell you, 6 ways to beat The Platform. First, what are the VSC\xe2\x80\x99s rules: 1. You can bring one item into the VSC, it could be a knife, book, gun, rope, anything that could fit into a carry-on luggage bag, there\xe2\x80\x99s no TSA checkpoint before entering the Vertical Self-Management Center. 2. You are randomly assigned to a floor level. At the end of each month the administration gasses you and you wake up at a new random level. 3. You are randomly assigned cell mates, and unless your cellmate perishes, you stick with them when moving floors. 4. If your cellmate perishes, you won\xe2\x80\x99t get a new one until the start of the next month. 5. Food is served once per day on a table-sized concrete platform. It theoretically carries enough food for most levels if rationed correctly. 6. If you try to hold or store any food after the platform moves to the next level, the administration will crank the thermostat knob in either direction, either freezing you or incinerating you. 7. You can ride the platform down without consequence. But we\xe2\x80\x99re unsure about the ride up. 8. Once the platform reaches the bottom, under level 333, it rockets back to the top. It would be a bad idea to try to catch a ride on it as it\xe2\x80\x99s going up. 9. Besides all the above rules, pretty much anything goes, including murder and cannabilization. This is why you need to read the fine print before signing up for things. Okay so how do we beat this: 1. Kill everyone else. If everybody\xe2\x80\x99s dead there can\xe2\x80\x99t be a food shortage. Depending on how sociopathic you are, or how long your sentence is. This could be either your first or last option. Actually, this is kind of what ended up happening when Goreng and Baharat tried to enforce rationing. When lunch time comes, hop on and ride the platform down with sharpened pieces of bed frame. Every level you can go down, you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to eliminate two people. Now here\xe2\x80\x99s the deal, riding the platform up is risky, as you don\xe2\x80\x99t know if the platform tops out at the tower ceiling turning you into a pancake. I\xe2\x80\x99d avoid riding up for now. So if you started at level 5, and killed everyone from 5 down to 333 where you currently reside for the month, you\xe2\x80\x99ll still get the same food as you would\xe2\x80\x99ve on level 5. Not much of an improvement. But. The next month if you find yourself on level 200, there will be a lot less people above you eating the food, so you won\xe2\x80\x99t starve. Now if the VSC has a large backlog of applicants, this will throw a giant wrench in the plan. Imagine riding down the tower killing hundreds of people, then relaxing on level 333 for the rest of the month knowing that next month if you\xe2\x80\x99re on a bad level you\xe2\x80\x99ll still get all the food. Then the next month you wake up on level 300, normally you\xe2\x80\x99d freak out because you\xe2\x80\x99ll get no food, but not this time. You killed everyone else. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure they refilled some levels with people as they normally do. Lunchtime comes and you\xe2\x80\x99re rubbing your hands together and licking your lips, waiting for that giant feast. You hear the buzz and see the platform come down. Wait, what the fuck, where\xe2\x80\x99s all the food. I killed everyone, they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have refilled hundreds of positions the next month. I killed all those people for nothing. No! 2. Wait it out. If you only have a few months in the hole and you have some extra body fat, the probability of surviving and getting out is okay. Trying to buck the system will probably end in your death. That said, the longer your sentence, the chances of death becomes extremely high. In the movie it seems like the platform only stays for a few minutes before moving on, so all the calorie dense foods are going to be gone quickly as people will be rushing to stuff their face and get as many calories in as possible before the platform moves. If you are placed on floor 111 or lower you get almost no food. You effectively have only about a 30 percent chance of being placed on a level that gives you enough food to survive. We know Goreng volunteered for six months in exchange for a diploma, and Trimagasi had a one year sentence. If you have 6 months, that means six chances. The average male weighs 190 at 5 foot 9 at 20 percent body fat. Essential levels of body fat to survive is around 5%. That means the average person has about 25 pounds of fat, or about 90,000 calories they can live off of without food. Considering that same male will burn around 2000 calories every day just sitting around in their cell. This gives your average male 45 days without food. This means that if you are placed on level 111 or lower once you could survive, but twice and you will starve. So 6 coin tosses, we need 5 tosses to land level 111 or above, as 2 tosses below 111 and we are dead. The chances of us being placed above floor 111 for 5 out of 6 months is 1.09%. Looks like solution number 1 isn\xe2\x80\x99t so crazy. In Trimagasi\xe2\x80\x99s case, he had some extra weight, so let\xe2\x80\x99s say he could survive 3 months without food. He had a 12 month sentence so he\xe2\x80\x99d need 9 months above level 111. His chances of survival is .17 %. I\xe2\x80\x99d say he should get some lotto tickets after he gets out, but that\xe2\x80\x99s a hot hand fallacy, oh and also he was stabbed to death. 3. Ride the platform up. If you are too weak, old, or sick to perform solution number one, and your sentence is longer than 3 months so solution number 2 is out, then take the risk of being pancaked and ride the platform down then back up. You could be murdered on the way down, but you don\xe2\x80\x99t have many options here. 4. Don\xe2\x80\x99t volunteer to do 6 months in a place that you know is called the hole. There are references in the movie from characters having some knowledge about this facility, and what it\xe2\x80\x99s called. Baharat brought rope indicating he knew the layout to some degree. Others brought guns and swords indicating they knew it was a dangerous place to be. If you didn\xe2\x80\x99t know much or couldn\xe2\x80\x99t verify the conditions you\xe2\x80\x99d be placed in, that is a bad sign. If you know it\xe2\x80\x99s called the hole, don\xe2\x80\x99t volunteer. Your diploma is not worth it. 5. If you generally knew what the hole was and were stupid enough to sign up anyways or you were sentenced, what could you bring to help you survive your sentence. Well a weapon would help with solution number 1. Considering you\xe2\x80\x99d potentially need to kill hundreds of people, you\xe2\x80\x99d probably want to pick a reusable weapon like a sword instead of a firearm. Unless you could carry a bunch of ammo. If you could carry a .22 pistol with a brick of 500-1000 rounds which isn\xe2\x80\x99t that large, you could eliminate everyone in the VSC multiple times over. Food could help with solution number 2 depending on how much you could bring, though you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be able to bring enough food in a carry-on to help you survive more than an extra month. In a six month sentence, an extra month of food would raise your chances of survival from 1.09 % to 7.05%. Ropes, grappling hooks, extendable ladders, etc., are all dependent on the people above you to work, which makes them ineffective. To be honest, I can\xe2\x80\x99t think of much you could bring in a carry-on that would help much. Let me know in the comments if you have any ideas! 6. Climb up. But how, the chances that multiple levels of people would help you up is insane. Here is a possible idea. Fashion a rope out of the bed sheets and clothes, and tie a huge knot at the end. Once the platform is about to stop at the level above you, throw the rope up. It will get wedged at the top by the platform. The people above will be too preoccupied eating as much as they can to notice. Then climb up the rope with a weapon. Once the platform starts to lower, quickly climb on top of the platform and then jump to the level above you. If you have a trustworthy cellmate like Baharat this would help. Kill those above as they will probably be mad they have to share food with you and will sabotage your strategy like crabs in a bucket. Rinse and repeat for every floor above you. You do have to be within 30 floors of the top, because the platform only comes down once per day, and you have 30 days before being randomly assigned to a new floor. If you make it to the top and they gas and place you back in the hole, revisit solution number 1. Those are my 6 potential solutions for how to beat the platform.
