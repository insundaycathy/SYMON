If you were forced to participate in an aliens sick game of who lives and who dies, what could you do? In this video on Nerd Explains. I'll tell you how to beat, The Circle. Very intimidating name by the way. The Circle. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to throw us onto one of the red circles and see how we fare. We don\xe2\x80\x99t have perfect knowledge and we don\xe2\x80\x99t know how this ends, we know what the characters know at the start. Can we beat this situation? Let\xe2\x80\x99s find out. For some reason we wake up before everyone else, maybe we\xe2\x80\x99re more immune to alien tranquilizers than everyone else, idk. All we remember is running from alien ships before we blacked out and were tractor beamed into the ship. We're in a circular room with a bunch of strangers. There are red circles underneath everyone. There are arrows pointing to each person, and a black half dome in the middle of the room. We can\xe2\x80\x99t see the rest of the room, it\xe2\x80\x99s too dark. There isn\xe2\x80\x99t much to go off of at this point. It\xe2\x80\x99s best just to hang out and see what happens. Everyone is still standing but asleep, until a lady wakes up. She\xe2\x80\x99s pretty bewildered and tries to step off her red circle. Nope, gets a nice warning buzzer that\xe2\x80\x99d make Dennis Reynolds flinch. She tries to touch another person, same thing. Another woman wakes up, freaks out, steps off her red circle, and the black thing in the middle of the room shocks her with a red energy beam, dropping her to the floor unconscious. It might be a non-lethal taser, but we get a look at the lady who was beamed, and there\xe2\x80\x99s blood coming out of her eye. I\xe2\x80\x99m not a doctor, but I think that means either she\xe2\x80\x99s dead or she coincidentally suffers from haemolacria like the bond villain in Casino Royale. We\xe2\x80\x99re gonna go with her being dead though. This is weird because the first woman tested these boundaries and wasn\xe2\x80\x99t killed. She was warned by a buzzer. The second woman to awake was killed immediately when she stepped off. Why was the first woman spared but not the second. It\xe2\x80\x99s possible this alien thing only allotted the entire group 1 warning for breaking a rule of touching and moving. A loud buzzer goes off and wakes everyone up. A dude freaks out, starts to run, and gets blasted. It\xe2\x80\x99s pretty clear that we need to keep our hands and feet inside the circle at all times. From what we can tell, there are fifty participants with sparse recollection of how and why they are at the circle, other than they were running from alien ships of course. You have all races, ages, classes, disabilities, professions, pregnancy statuses, etc. I\xe2\x80\x99d say it\xe2\x80\x99s too random to be random. Everyone here was probably chosen purposefully because they are distinct from the other people in some way. A beeping countdown sounds off, and the plasma globe in the middle of the room kills another person, seemingly at random. There\xe2\x80\x99s no way this is random though, what\xe2\x80\x99s the point of it being random. We inevitably realize that our hands are changing what arrow is lit up on the floor, and that closing our hands confirms our selection by evidence of a distinct beep noise. These arrows are pointing to other people. It\xe2\x80\x99s a voting mechanism for who gets lasered next. We can only see and control our vote, so we don\xe2\x80\x99t know who other people are voting for. After two minutes pass, another person is zapped, the person with the most votes. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take a psychologist to realize that this situation will devolve into discrimination, tribalism, and manipulation. It\xe2\x80\x99s probably best we stay quiet. Once people realize that their vote kills people, anything we say or do will be used against us. People will look for any reason to take us out. Just like with the police, it\xe2\x80\x99s best we keep our mouth shut and not incriminate ourselves. This is not the time or place to go on a political or ideological rant as we\xe2\x80\x99d probably just piss people off and make enemies. We should also avoid lying unless we have to. It\xe2\x80\x99s better to stay quiet than to lie, but if we\xe2\x80\x99re pressed, it\xe2\x80\x99s better to lie than to admit to something that damns us. If we did commit a crime in the past, and the cop in the room does try to get us targeted to save his own ass, just deny everything, nobody can prove anything. Stick to lies about opinions that nobody can disprove, if we have an unpopular opinion, don\xe2\x80\x99t voice that shit. We later see with one man and woman, falsifying a marriage might sound like a decent idea. I mean, who would want to kill someone in front of their wife or husband? The problem is that it\xe2\x80\x99s a giant, unmanageable lie. If anyone gets suspicious of us and questions both of us, we\xe2\x80\x99ll easily get found out. Someone just has to ask, what year did you both meet, say it at the same time on the count of 3. We\xe2\x80\x99ll most likely answer differently. If we get found out for lying, our chances of being marked for death goes through the roof. Surviving this game is obviously going to be heavily dependent on carefully choosing the words that come out of our mouth, or whether we say anything at all. The group begins choosing who lives and who dies in order to buy them time to figure out what to do, starting with the elderly, two minutes a pop. People with perceived low value, or people that are at the last rungs of their life will be the first to go. If you are elderly, look sickly, don\xe2\x80\x99t speak the common language, have criminal looking tattoos, your chances of surviving go way down. If you are a child or pregnant, your chances probably go up. We can\xe2\x80\x99t exactly control these things though. This alien energy orb in the middle of the room is killing another person every 2 minutes. At fifty people in the room, that gives us 100 minutes before everyone is dead. Not a lot of time. Maybe if we can understand what\xe2\x80\x99s going on, the motivations behind it, a potential goal the alien\xe2\x80\x99s might have, we can find a way out of this in time. Other participants try to find out more info about each other in hopes that they can understand how things are related and why they were chosen. This part of the movie made me want to ram my head through a wall. You are on the clock, spit it the fuck out beth. *Tropic thunder spit that shit out man* Go wahoos? Are you fucking kidding me, people are going to die based on time you take and the words you need to be carefully and quickly selecting, and you chose the most valueless mix of sounds to contribute? I\xe2\x80\x99m not entirely sure nobody voted that round.. The best thing we can do is to contribute something about our abduction, or about the rules of the game. We\xe2\x80\x99d provide value, humanize ourselves, but we won\xe2\x80\x99t reveal anything personal that people can use against us. Ya know, like saying you know another person because you\xe2\x80\x99re cheating on your wife with them, it\xe2\x80\x99s just, like why say that, just keep that to yourselves man. Keeping quiet only helps us avoid being aggressively targeted. The opposite is also true though, if we are quiet and unhelpful, we can be targeted because the group doesn\xe2\x80\x99t see that we\xe2\x80\x99re providing any contribution or value towards solving the problem. We need to humanize ourselves or else we\xe2\x80\x99ll be easier to kill. If we are tied with someone else, and we have humanized ourselves more, contributed more valuable things, we are less likely to be killed. Seeing the aesthetic of the room, the voting mechanism, it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty reasonable to assume that this is some form of game, experiment, or intelligently designed means of selection. I mean, why set up a situation like this if you were simply going to exterminate everyone. We can probably rule out the circle as a means of selection based on the randomness and lack of clarity around the rules. If people are killed based on the flip of a coin or because they happened to be the first person to break an obscure rule that nobody knew, how good can the selection be. I mean shit, even Jigsaw announced his rules upfront. This also means there is no strategy that needs to rely on merit or morals. Sweet. If you thought sacrificing yourselves was a possible way to win the game by showing that you won\xe2\x80\x99t devolve into indignity, it\xe2\x80\x99s most likely not. Later on this is somewhat confirmed, as we didn\xe2\x80\x99t see anyone beam up to heaven to smoke weed with James Franco for sacrificing themself. We can\xe2\x80\x99t rule out this whole thing being an experiment, but it would suck as lab rats don\xe2\x80\x99t often regain their freedom. The other option is that this is some form of game. Regardless, we need to test the game or experiment to find out what all the rules or parameters are. We need to make public suggestions to try new strategies that could help us understand how to beat the game. Again, this is when speaking up can make us valuable and humanize us more. Let\xe2\x80\x99s just quickly run through a myriad of potential strategies. What if nobody votes? All the voting lights lit up in a unique way indicating that everyone successfully didn\xe2\x80\x99t vote. Unfortunately, this didn\xe2\x80\x99t stop the killings. Someone at random was shocked at the end of the round. What about voting for an empty spot from a previously killed person? Nope, someone at random was killed again. What if everyone votes for themselves? You can\xe2\x80\x99t, it just automatically selects the next spot to your left or right. You can however, step off your red circle to sacrifice yourselves, if that\xe2\x80\x99s your thing. Doing so will reset the 2 minute countdown until someone is to be lasered again. What if everyone votes for the person to their right, equal votes for everyone forcing an all participant tie? Well, we actually don\xe2\x80\x99t know what would happen. A guy defected and chose a pregnant woman instead of the person to his right. Another person saw this and voted for that guy, forcing a tie between a man and a pregnant woman. They revoted and killed the guy who defected, breaking the tie. It\xe2\x80\x99s fair to assume that if this strategy was successful, they\xe2\x80\x99d all tie. As we found out, if a tie occurs and isn't broken, everyone tied will be killed. It\xe2\x80\x99s probably a good thing they didn\xe2\x80\x99t try this again. Based on our previous failed strategies, and the rules we discovered, the circle does allow for a scenario where one person can survive. If it comes down to two remaining people, and one person doesn\xe2\x80\x99t vote while the other does vote, or if one person sacrifices themself, the next round will consist of only one survivor. Since you can\xe2\x80\x99t vote for yourselves, and nobody can vote for you, the last person might not be killed. Sure, we could end up lasered even as the last remaining person, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a Pascal's Wager type situation where the only reasonable assumption and action to take is the one where we have a possibility of surviving. We can only assume that this is a last man standing type game. At this point we might want to consider if we want to win, or if we can live with ourselves if we do win. Most likely, at some point, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to vote out and kill a child. And you thought Monopoly ruined families and friendships. But as they say, don\xe2\x80\x99t hate the player, hate the game. Let\xe2\x80\x99s say we want to win, and be the sole survivor no matter the cost. In order to do that, the game needs to come down to two people at the end that won\xe2\x80\x99t tie each other. It\xe2\x80\x99s a type of Prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s Dilemma. If both people vote for each other, they both die. If nobody votes, it\xe2\x80\x99s a 50/50 that we die, which is still unpreferable. The only way that we can 100% survive is if the other person doesn\xe2\x80\x99t vote while we vote for them. Who wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t vote though? A person that is inclined to sacrifice themself, like Shaun, an elderly or sickly person. The problem is that they will most likely be voted out early on, so suggesting a voting direction that spares them won\xe2\x80\x99t work. What about someone that we can fool into not voting. The Circle is similar to a game called, So Long Sucker, where the only way to win is by eliminating other players through deceit and betrayal. Like in So Long Sucker, eliminating enemies isn\xe2\x80\x99t as important as propping up gullible allies that you can betray more easily in the endgame. This is true in the circle as well. In order to fool someone into not voting, that person has to be gullible enough to believe that we will sacrifice ourselves for them, and that they don\xe2\x80\x99t need to vote as we\xe2\x80\x99ll step off our circle to be lasered voluntarily. Of course, we aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to sacrifice ourselves. As the countdown draws down, we distract them with some emotional last words, we fake stepping off our circle, then at the last second, we cast our vote for them, causing them to be killed off leaving us as the sole survivor. Who would genuinely believe that we\xe2\x80\x99d sacrifice ourselves for them? It has to be a person that most people wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t question sacrificing themselves for. Like, a pregnant woman or child. I know, I know, it\xe2\x80\x99s fucked up, but I already said that winning this game comes at a cost, and whether you\xe2\x80\x99re willing to pay it is up to you. I'm not saying pregnant women or children are inherently more gullible. I\xe2\x80\x99m saying that they are gullible because it\xe2\x80\x99s normal and generally accepted that people should sacrifice themselves for children or pregnant women in a lifeboat scenario. To put it in perspective, it would be much harder to convince the discount version of Jordan Belfort that you'll sacrifice yourselves for him. He has no reason to believe or trust you, why on Earth would someone sacrifice themself for that person. They are arrogant, but they know it\xe2\x80\x99s against the norm for people to sacrifice for them. Hopefully I'm making sense here. They are gullible because it\xe2\x80\x99s a cultural norm for people to sacrifice themselves for them, and they are more likely to falsely trust you based on this. This game is as much about sociopathic charisma as anything. Once the game comes down to us and that other person, we have to turn the emotional knob up. We need to distract them by telling an earnest but untrue story about how we\xe2\x80\x99ve lived a lot of life, and that we\xe2\x80\x99re okay with her living so the baby can have a chance at life too. Maybe a story about how we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be the survivor, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve killed someone in a drunk driving accident a couple years ago and that we\xe2\x80\x99re honestly not that great of a person. Like faking a come to jesus moment where we are okay with letting go of life. Tell her she needs to promise to make the best of things, and make sure her kid has a great life. Ask her what she\xe2\x80\x99s going to name her kid, get her mind off of any need to vote. If it\xe2\x80\x99s a kid, do something similar. They have a lot of life to live, we\xe2\x80\x99ve already lived enough and want to give them a chance, yadda yadda. We\xe2\x80\x99re essentially re-affirming that they don\xe2\x80\x99t need to vote as we\xe2\x80\x99re going to sacrifice ourselves for them. It also helps that earlier on we set the groundwork for this and earned their trust, which I'll come back to in a bit. This sounds like a nifty plan, but how do we ensure that the game comes down to us and someone else we can fool into not voting. Suggest a voting direction that spares them. Most people would probably agree with us and nobody can paint us as being selfish and predatory. We also earn trust points with the child or pregnant woman that will be important once it comes down to them and us, like we talked about earlier. While there is likely to be conflict with this suggestion, it\xe2\x80\x99s our best bet at getting a majority to spare them. We absolutely do not want the game to come down to us and sweater vest, he will 100% vote for us and cause a tie, getting both of us killed. Hopefully we\xe2\x80\x99ve effectively swayed enough votes in favor of protecting the child or pregnant woman. There are still a lot of people left though, so how do we ensure that we make it to the final round. There are some important, albeit counter-intuitive, aspects of the So Long Sucker game that can be applied to the Circle. Overtly trying to win is actually an effective way to lose. If we are found to have gamed, betrayed anyone, or have a strong potential to influence the direction of the game, we will be targeted as a predator that needs to be eliminated in order to level the playing field. This is why we don\xe2\x80\x99t want to assume any leadership positions, just make light-handed suggestions. Trying to develop a super-strategy that plans ahead of everyone\xe2\x80\x99s moves and outmaneuvers everyone is hopeless, given the complexity of the game. There are too many interactions between people with dynamic psychologies and backgrounds, too much of the game depends on randomness and unknown rules. We can\xe2\x80\x99t compute the possible plays of everyone. If we try, we\xe2\x80\x99re likely to get too aggressive or make a mistake that reveals us as trying to game everyone else. The next best thing to do is give others enough room to make mistakes, or more realistically, enough rope to hang themselves with. People will get aggressive, lash out, prey on others, say stupid things, discriminate in order to save themselves. All of these things are likely to get the majority to vote for them next. Probably the best way to ensure we make it to the final round is to just stay quiet and reserved. Subtly influencing the group to spare the pregnant woman or child is the most important play. As the participants get whittled down, our leverage goes up. Once it\xe2\x80\x99s down to a handful of people, the pregnant woman or child, who hopefully trust us more than others, will vote in our favor in order to eliminate anyone they think will be selfish. They know they need someone who is willing to let them live, so they need to keep us alive, and will help us vote out anyone else that will be viewed as more selfish. This gets us to the final round with them. So to recap, we\xe2\x80\x99ve ensured our survival by staying relatively quiet, we\xe2\x80\x99ve ensured the survival of another person that thinks we\xe2\x80\x99ll sacrifice ourselves for them, and now we can hopefully distract them and deceive them enough to where they don\xe2\x80\x99t vote. Once the countdown draws down, we cast a last minute vote, killing them. Once we get returned to Earth, we will probably want to go see a therapist and get some anti-depressant medication. But hey, we won. If you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the movie, this is pretty much what Eric does in order to win. From what I can tell, it\xe2\x80\x99s the only way. It\xe2\x80\x99s by no means a surefire way to win. You still have a super low chance of winning despite all of these strategies and tactics. There are too many dynamic variables and things out of your control. These people had 100 minutes to figure this out after being abducted, drugged, and chaotically forced into a life and death game. I\xe2\x80\x99m almost certain I would die if placed in the same circumstances. I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty sure I either over-thought this or missed something completely. If you have a better suggestion for winning the death game in the Circle, i\xe2\x80\x99d love to hear about it so please leave a comment. Thanks for watching, see ya later.
