Welcome to Slash Forward. Imagine, if you will, that you lost some family members due to a terrible tragedy, but that their remains were never recovered. Through extensive searching at your own personal cost you not only locate them, but find that despite being children alone in the woods, they are still alive. Do you think you would have what it takes to nurture and raise them through their recovery and subsequent development? If so, would you still feel as confident if they had taken on the mannerisms of a feral ghost woman and forgone all social norms? Today we\xe2\x80\x99re going to learn how to do just that through the training vehicle that is the 2013 film Mama. It was produced by Guillermo Del Toro, but actually directed by Andy Muschietti whose story intertwines folklore with a story grounded in reality. Do you think he lived up to Guillermo\xe2\x80\x99s expectations? Let me know what you thought in the comments below and if you enjoy the video, hitting the like button would help me out a lot. Let\xe2\x80\x99s get to it. We open on radio exposition describing a market crash pursuant to an office shooting at a holding company where one of the senior partners, Jeff Desange, went missing. We then find Victoria and Lilly waiting patiently as footsteps pound down the hall. Their father Jeff bursts in and rushes them out of the house, sans mommy. They\xe2\x80\x99re going nowhere in particular, but Jeff really wants to get there fast, leading to an inevitable loss of control. Back at the house we find his brother Lucas and the police a few steps behind in the confusion, and the picture comes into resolution as the radio now confirms that Jeff Desange was the shooter, and that the target of his ire was his estranged wife who is confirmed dead. Now fleeing on foot they find reprieve in an abandoned cabin that was named after a font - oh, uh, partially abandoned. Jeff starts a fire to help the girls settle into their new life in the country, and then goes to engage in his midafternoon meltdown. This is interrupted when Victoria sees a woman outside who\xe2\x80\x99s not on the ground. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t hear this, however, because he\xe2\x80\x99s consumed with exploring ways to assuage his guilt. He settles on keeping the girls from harm by mortally harming them, but is diverted by a dark entity. In the night, as they wait patiently and wonder how they will survive, they\xe2\x80\x99re provided a single cherry. That should tide them over. Flash forward five years to Lucas in his apartment coordinating an ongoing search effort for his brother\xe2\x80\x99s remains. When his girlfriend Annabel comes out to join him, they discuss the fact that the hired searchers\xe2\x80\x99 last paycheck bounced because Lucas has spent all his money searching for dear Jeff. Not realizing, of course, that he attempted to kill his own children. Luckily, since they\xe2\x80\x99re already out there, he\xe2\x80\x99s still got the boys on the hook for now. Even more lucky - when Ron goes to take a leak, he rolls a Yahtzee in the form of Jeff\xe2\x80\x99s Benz. He and Burnsie head deeper into the wilderness and find the abandoned cabin, entering cautiously. There is clear evidence inside of the presence of children at some point, due to the wall drawings, thousands of cherry pits and, of course, the two feral children who confront them. The successful rescue is considered generally good, except it really cramps Annabel\xe2\x80\x99s rock and roll lifestyle. Regardless, she supports Lucas as he visits Dr. Dreyfuss, who warns that while Victoria is showing signs of recovery, Lilly may have been too young to be normalized for polite society. Lucas goes in delicately and finds the girls to be very quick and agile, and he tries to win over Victoria with a new pair of specs like a proper English lass. They form a bond as he is the spitting image of Jeff and, of course, she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know that daddy had intended to kill her. Ninety days later Dr. Dreyfuss gives a positive report as they\xe2\x80\x99re making good progress. He explains that they survived by creating an imaginary guardian they call mama who cared for them and fed them cherries. He recommends a transplant into a loving home. But we also learn this hearing is a debate with their maternal aunt Jean vying for custody of the girls. Dr. Dreyfuss does wonder whether Lucas and Annabel are serious enough about parenthood to convert to a sufficiently clean lifestyle to care for the girls. But on the other hand, Jean lives on the other side of the country, and the Dr. wants to keep the girls close so he can leach off that clout. Buuuut, if they agree to stay in a house the uni keeps for research purposes and provide him unlimited access, they can win his recommendation. And soon they\xe2\x80\x99re reassuring Jean that they intend to honor her visitation rights. Dreyfuss starts right in with the questioning. Victoria claims Mama showed her in a dream how a woman escaped from a psychiatric hospital, fleeing into the wilderness with her baby before jumping off a cliff. After Annabel breaks up with her band, putting her musical aspirations behind her, they all converge on their new home. Annabel seems eager to set some clear rules oh, thanks. And then they go to the backyard, which has been outfitted with some sweet boxes and a dachshund. Then they enjoy a simple dinner, each in their own way, before turning in for the night. Soon thereafter Dr. Dreyfuss goes to research some medical records and see if he can find evidence of a patient like the one Victoria described. Luckily he runs across a very helpful clerk who points him to the 19th century case of Edith Brennan. Just so we all know the situation, we\xe2\x80\x99re brought back to the house where the girls engage in some crafts and synchronized humming. Then, when putting away laundry Annabel nearly walks in on a game of tug of war that involves Lilly and not Victoria. Later on, during a jam sesh, there\xe2\x80\x99s an electrical disturbance accompanied by some strange noises. It may have just been Lilly acting like a little freak, but Annabel is left shaking like a leaf. Although, it\xe2\x80\x99s really nothing that a little smoochin\xe2\x80\x99 can\xe2\x80\x99t cure, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure. But a figure in the mirror takes her out of the mood. Lucas goes to investigate, but finds the girls fast asleep. Insistent that she didn\xe2\x80\x99t imagine it, she sends him off to check downstairs. Along the way he finds a strange, creeping fungus expanding across the wall. The inky darkness eventually gives birth to a moth before something else instigates an involuntary moonsault over the top rope into a bellybuster across the staircase. Despite taking a good bump, he winds up in the ICU in a hopefully temporary coma. Then Dr. Dreyfuss casually strolls in to nonchalantly make it seem like it would be only natural for Annabel to take over care of the girls. At home, again, we have no signs of entry or theft, which means the police are powerless to do anything. So she settles into bed and promptly has a nightmare. Lilly\xe2\x80\x99s there, natch, but she\xe2\x80\x99s snapped awake by strange moanings in the dark. The next day we learn that the girls are coping with this tragedy by talking to the walls and making elaborate crafts. Jogging a memory, Dreyfuss goes back to his earlier tapes where there was a similar doll that the girls claimed was made by mama. He also notes that Victoria has an unnerving way of looking past his shoulder toward the ceiling. He then gets a voicemail from the friendly clerk at public records to let him know that she made a new discovery. At the house, they\xe2\x80\x99re all having a pretty chill evening, even though Annabel gets suspicious that they\xe2\x80\x99re goofin on her. Then everyone goes to bed, but mama almost immediately comes out of the closet for gametime. The girls start up their synchronized humming again, which wakes Annabel, and she is disturbed when they\xe2\x80\x99re joined by an unexpected bass. She whips the door open and shames the girls for having a good time. Unable to shake the feeling that there was someone else with them, she approaches the closet. However, when Victoria pleads with her not to open it, she respects their privacy. She visits with the Dr. to discuss her concern that someone is coming to visit them in the night. He plays some video of their humming to confirm if it\xe2\x80\x99s the same song. It is, but she insists it was tuned to a much lower register. This leads the Dr. to suggest dissociative personality disorder - he believes Victoria is mama as a means of coping. Seeing that Annabel is disturbed by this, he reassures her that it\xe2\x80\x99s a treatable condition and that she\xe2\x80\x99s safe. I mean, what can a nine year old with a knife do to an adult while she\xe2\x80\x99s sleeping anyway? Later at the archives, the Dr. is guided to another file she found regarding the Edith Brennan matter - it\xe2\x80\x99s box of physical remains, so that\xe2\x80\x99s cool. Then, she educates ya boi on the secrets of the occult She is such a tremendous help here, and she suggests there is some sort of wrong that needs to be righted. Back with the girls, Lilly is still popping out of boxes and making weird noises, and Annabel gets a whiff of mama. And then at the hospital we are shocked to discover that, despite her age, mama is a straight up hacker. She helps Lucas by giving him a vision that directs him toward the cabin, followed by a grand mal seizure. Hey, thanks! The family visits now that Lucas is awake, and they all share their longings of reuniting. The visit is spent sharing pictures and nibbling on nearby moths. But at home, Victoria has become morose. She\xe2\x80\x99s softening toward Annabel and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want her to get hurt due to mama\xe2\x80\x99s jealous streak. Then Jean arrives, because she gets the girls on Thursdays. Understanding that Annabel is not a natural mother figure, she tries to leverage this by enticing her to let her have the girls for a few days so she can go rock out and do some drugs. Instead, Annabel runs her off, but only after ruling her out as a suspect in the mystery of the baritone hummer. Of course, Jean\xe2\x80\x99s a bitch, so she goes straight to her car to call CPS. Annabel tries to loop Lucas in on these events so he\xe2\x80\x99s in the know, and he lets slip that the girls are the most important thing to him, complicating their relationship. Sometime later Victoria has another hypnosis session where the Dr. gets right into asking about mama. He\xe2\x80\x99s told she lives in the walls, but doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get much more than that. He insists on trying to ascertain her true identity, leading to an emotional outburst and another wall apparition. He tries to mask his fear and scoot out of there like nothing\xe2\x80\x99s wrong, but he knows he\xe2\x80\x99s on to something big. Through narration of his session notes, we learn he believes he\xe2\x80\x99s found some sort of doorway and intends to acquire the evidence needed to prove this extraordinary discovery. That evening mama decides to show Annabel some scenes relating to the circumstances surrounding her flight from the hospital, pursuit through the woods and escape at all costs mentality. This pushes her into another dream in which she becomes mama\xe2\x80\x99s small spoon before she fully wakes up. Meanwhile, in the girls\xe2\x80\x99 room, Lilly wants Victoria to come with her and mama, but she chooses to stay behind. As a result, Lilly escapes too late and finds mama has already left the area. Because, concurrently, Dr. Dreyfuss has arrived at the cabin, at night of course, and mama has some haunting to do. He finds the gateway and calls out to mama, hoping to open a dialogue with her. He claims to be able to provide what she needs, but soon learns that she\xe2\x80\x99s not really interested in all that. The next morning, Annabel wakes up and discovers Lilly shivering in the bushes. Maternal instincts kick in and she rushes her inside to try to warm her up with some jiu-jitsu. After a struggle, the warm touch of a corporeal mommy finally breaks through her feral ways. But, that\xe2\x80\x99s not good in terms of the jealousy issue. Victoria then whips up a quick spaghetti breakfast as Annabel tells Lilly to head downstairs. But then a devastating revelation. She peers into the closet and finds the doorway, but is interrupted before finding more. Her first instinct is to consult with Dr. Dreyfuss, but she can\xe2\x80\x99t seem to reach him. So she drives to his office and finds his assistant to be somewhat frazzled by his disappearance. Taking advantage of the lack of supervision, she hops into his office and swipes his box of records. As she\xe2\x80\x99s doing that, Lucas starts feeling an intense itch to get his ass over to Clifton Forge, which he does. Once they get back to the house, we see that the box had the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s whole damn laptop. It reveals his thirst for fame and fortune as she finds a draft of the book about mama that he\xe2\x80\x99s working on. She also finds a recording of the therapy session explaining mama\xe2\x80\x99s origins, which matches her dream. In this expanded version, we learn that mama and the baby were separated on the way down, and she had been wandering the woods looking for her until she happened upon the girls who assuaged her sadness. The human remains that were filed away are actually of the baby. A little later, Victoria attempts to comfort Annabel and tells her that she loves her. While outside mean Jean rolls up looking to get some sweet evidence she can turn over to CPS. Upstairs the girls are playing when they hear something. They go downstairs and find mama, but Victoria recognizes that she\xe2\x80\x99s mad, which sends them scurrying. Hearing the ruckus Annabel comes to check on them, but her appearance only exacerbates the rage. So mama chases her down and tackles her. The girls are like: Moooom, stop suckin on backs, it\xe2\x80\x99s embarrassing! Their empathy gives her pause, and Jean\xe2\x80\x99s presence downstairs distracts her fully. Jean is shocked to find immediate evidence of substandard housekeeping. Victoria arrives at the kitchen and finds aunt Jean twerkin\xe2\x80\x99 like crazy, apparently now a vessel for mama. When Annabel wakes up, the girls are gone. Thinking quickly she grabs the remains and heads to Clifton Forge. She calls Lucas along the way, but can\xe2\x80\x99t reach him, but then he shows up in the road and then they find the cabin. Inside is Jean\xe2\x80\x99s husk, but no sign of the others. They head out back and find their way to the cliff where the ladies are just hanging out. In an attempt to extricate the girls from her custody, Annabel distracts mama with her actual child\xe2\x80\x99s desiccated remains. This rejuvenates her to a significant degree, until Lilly snaps her back into reality. To reclaim her prize she gives Lucas\xe2\x80\x99s heart a little squeeze and tosses Annabel aside like a sack of potatoes. Unwilling to let go, the two factions tentatively arrive at a split agreement through which mama will retain custody of Lilly and Victoria will remain with the living. Mama and Lilly then recreate that fateful event and, upon impact, turn into some moths, so that\xe2\x80\x99s cool. Ultimately, it is very sad but also, it\xe2\x80\x99s not like Lilly really fit in very well anyway. Wow, did we just watch the same movie two weeks in a row? And they were both released in 2013! Not to imply that they were copies or anything, but just to say it\xe2\x80\x99s interesting how strongly implanted some of these tropes are in our collective storytelling minds. You can basically take the same framework and repackage it, and it hits in a completely different way. I did enjoy Mama more than Dark Skies. I think it had more mood and style throughout, and a slightly more concrete set of rules to help carry us through the story. Obviously, being so similar, both films fall short in some of the same ways. So, rather than reiterate everything I said about Dark Skies, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to try to expand on my prior critiques. I think movies like this run a risk in becoming preoccupied with the general concept of the film. When I said the movie feels like lots of little things happening, I meant that it felt as though the filmmakers came up with what they thought would be a really interesting and creepy premise. Thinking about how the premise could be used, they then came up with a series of different scenes or events that could illustrate how the danger being presented works in the cinematic universe. Then, they have to develop some sort of story to stretch around it, hoping to pull everything together while keeping the audience\xe2\x80\x99s suspension of disbelief within reasonable boundaries. The end result can feel somewhat disjointed and is typically identified by movies having a strong start, somewhat muddled middle and often confusing or dissatisfying endings. Although, to the credit of this particular movie, it was at least interesting. Recent films like The Woman in the Window and Things Seen and Heard suffer the same weaknesses, but are also kind of boring. Mama and Dark Skies, on the other hand, are worth the time.
