to start your free trial and join in for the beginning of the end of the walking dead now on to the recap meet rick grimes he's a cop down in georgia who one day gets shot in the line of duty and winds up in a coma when he wakes up civilization has collapsed and the dead are a walk-in yes he slept right through the zombie apocalypse he goes home to find his family instead he meets morgan jones a nice guy who gives him the rules on how zombies work if you get bit you turn into one head shots are the only way to take them out for good they are attracted to noise though so avoid guns when possible and most importantly they never actually say zombie in this show every group has a different name for them but our group mostly calls them walkers so rick says cool thanks man maybe i'll catch you later and now works on a mission to find his family riding a horse into the ruins of atlanta epic shot turns out though major cities are not where you want to be because densely populated areas are now densely packed with zombies luckily we're saved by a friendly guy glenn who introduces him to our season 1 ogs there's andrea t-dog and merle who's a real a-hole picks a fight with t-dog but sheriff rick's here to lay down the law handcuffs them to the roof to cool off but now the group is trapped so they come up with a disgusting plan to rub zombie guts all over themselves yes if you smell like the dead the zombies kind of ignore you more on this later then as the group's leaving t-dog accidentally drops the handcuff key down the drain sorry man you suck anyway merle's abandoned on the roof this group has a nice campsite outside the city and wouldn't you know it rick's family is here he's reunited with his wife lori and his son carl aka coral his best friend and partner shane is here too but while they thought rick was dead he and laurie started getting it on now that rick's back though lori puts an end to that real quick in this group his old man dale who owns the rv and mostly stands on top of it keeping watch then there's carol the meek little housewife who has an abusive husband and there's daryl merle's hot-headed younger brother who's a real cool hunter type with a crossbow he is not happy they left his brother handcuffed to the roof but when they go down to rescue him he's already gone oh he found a saw and cut his hand off to escape one night at camp a bunch of zombies get in and eat all the background characters including andrea's sister amy who comes back as a zombie and oh it's traumatizing andrea's gotta put her down carol's abusive husband though not sad good riddance so with the camp not safe anymore the group hits the road they go to the center for disease control hoping it's still up and running looking for a cure unfortunately it's not there's only one scientist left alive they never even got close to a cure and the group showed up just in time this place is about to self-destruct so our group gets out of there boom and they leave the cdc a smoking ruin in season two our group hits a traffic jam and a whole herd of zombies are coming they hide under the cars but carol's daughter sophia gets spotted and has to run away and they can't find her they do find a deer but oh what carl gets shot girl yeah it was a random hunting accident from this guy who lived nearby on herschel's farm conveniently herschel is a doctor well a veterinarian but close enough to save carl he needs more meds though so shane and this guy go on a run to get him but on the way back they're swarmed they're not gonna make it so sheen's like sorry guy i pick carl over you shoots him in the leg uses him as zombie bait to get away hardcore shane then shane shaves his head to reflect his new hardcore persona so carl survives rick gives him a sheriff's hat which he never takes off for the rest of the series so if he is still missing though so the search continues and it's daryl who's the mvp here with his survivalist track and skills and we get to see his softer side here he really bonds with the grieving mother carol these two become best friends hershel has a daughter maggie who goes on a run to town with glenn he finds the last box of condoms and maggie's like well it's the apocalypse why not but these two fall in love and aren't together the rest of the series then there's a problem when herschel's barn is full of zombies yeah he doesn't admit their daddy thinks they're sick and will one day be cured shane is like oh hell no and leads the group on a zombie barn massacre and turns out zombie sofia has been in there the whole time oh it's tragic rick and jane argue over this but shane's like rick you're too soft for this world there's no good and bad anymore the right decision is the one that keeps us alive meanwhile laurie finds out she's pregnant so she tells rick about her and shane which was fair they thought he was dead but shane's not letting it go laurie can't take two steps this season without shane coming onto her in fact back at the cdc shane got drunk and stepped way over the line so these best friends continue to butt heads one day they meet some strangers who teach him the lesson you can't trust anyone in the zombie apocalypse long story short they end up with a prisoner and the group takes a vote on what to do with them dale's the only one who's like we can't kill this guy we gotta be good people unfortunately that night a zombie gets in and bites stale oh r.i.p dale and eric decides to let this guy live and shane doesn't approve he takes him out to the woods and kills him then roughs his face ups as the prisoner escaped so they go out searching for him and shane leads rick to a deserted meadow yeah he's gonna kill him it's like rick you're too soft you can't keep your family safe so i'm gonna do it for you but maybe rick's not too soft because oh sneaky knife stabs his former best friend r.i.p shane but shane doesn't stay dead what how's that possible he wasn't bit turns out there's a secret rick learned back at the cdc that he finally shares with the group everyone is infected the bite just gives you a fever that kills you but no matter how you die everyone comes back that same night a zombie heard shows up beats the rest of the background characters and our group leaves the farm a smoking ruin everyone's arguing about what to do next but rick's in no mood he's like look this ain't a democracy anymore it's a rictator ship so in season three the group's on the road they're really rough and it's eating dog food but soon they hit the jackpot when they find a prison with real tall fences that once kept prisoners in now it'll keep the zombies out first they have to clear all the walkers already inside and our groups become expert zombie killers now but there's always danger herschel gets bit on the leg and rick has to amputate hoping to stop the infection which luckily works so life at the prison's good for a while but zombies always get in and no one gets t-dog ript dog and wouldn't you know what the baby's coming right now maggie's gotta do an emergency c-section baby judith is okay but laurie dies r.i.p laurie and young carl has to shoot his mom in the head before she turns oh it's traumatizing no coral rex dramatized two he spends a few episodes hallucinating lori and is generally unhinged meanwhile andrea got separated from the group back at the farm she gets saved though by someone with a katana and zombies chained to them what this is michonne the katana wielding badass her walker bodyguards act as camouflage similar to the guts trick and since she cut out their mouths they can't bite her one day they're too noisy though she has to kill him but it doesn't help they're still found by merle yes he survived and now has an awesome knife hand he takes them to the town of woodbury a huge successful survivors community because they built big walls and seems like an amazing happy place it's led by a handsome charismatic man they call the governor he's like hey you guys are welcome to stay and andrea is like yeah of course in fact these two start hooking up but michonne doesn't trust this guy decides to go off on her own of course she was right he is a bad dude and immediately sends merle to go kill her instead merle finds maggie and glenn it's like hey man sorry about the handcuff roof thing but he takes him prisoner and instead of the friendly welcome andrea got he gives them the decidedly unfriendly welcome michonne finds the prison fills the group in they go for a rescue mission where michonne finds another of the governor's secrets he's got a zombie daughter yeah he refuses to accept she's really gone it's like don't hurt her but she's like man this a zombie and all katana this pushes him over the edge he's full crazy now and in their ensuing fight michonne oh stabs him in the eye that's okay though he gets to wear an eye patch now which just makes him look cooler merle tries to join our crew but no one wants him there except his brother daryl to earn his keep merle goes on a solo assassination mission but oh he misses the governor and the governor does not miss so when daryl arrives he finds zombie merle you were a bad guy but still my brother r.i.p merle and one episode morgan is back but he's crazy now tries to kill everyone on site so now the governor's right into war busts in there guns blazing but our group's ready for him and manages to chase him off the governor is like hey you cowards turn back and fight but they're like wait we're not soldiers we're just civilians but he's crazy and all mows them all down also we found out andrea betrayed him left her there with a zombie so when the group gets there oh she's bit r.i.p andrea so in season four the group takes in all the woodbury survivors most notably tyrese and his sister sasha we learned the three interview questions to see if you can join the group how many walkers are killed how many people he killed and why rick's trying to get some farming going but when a pig gets sick some people catch the pig flu when tyrese goes to visit his girlfriend and quarantine oh someone has killed her and the killer is carol who hoped to stop the spread yes carol is no longer the meek house wife we knew she's a hardened survivor secretly teaching the kids to use knives she's like look rick i did what had to be done for the good of the group but rick's like yo that wasn't your call to make you are banished and it didn't work anyway thus sickness spreads all the rest of the extras die luckily our main characters all make it but now there's a new threat because the governor is back after the battle he went home and left woodbury a smoking ruin he wandered the earth grew depression beard met some sisters who had a daughter that renewed his will to live ended up in a new camp that notably had a tank so he decided he should be in charge he took the tank and some hostages over to the prison and to show he means business oh beheaded herschel no rip herschel so it's governor fight round two tank boogaloo daryl busts out his sick call of duty skills takes out the tank no problem and the governor oh katana through the chest governor is defeated so our group survives but they're all split up and they've left the prison a smoking ruin rick's out of commish for a while and with no dad rules carl eats a whole tub of pudding but when rick's back in action he's not messing around he's kill you first ask questions later shane would be proud in fact it's right here when rick puts on his famous murder jacket so named because he becomes a feral beast who bites people's necks out tyreese made it out with baby judith and meets up with some more kids and carol who decides not to tell him she killed his girlfriend they find a map to terminus which claims to be a safe place unfortunately though one of these girls is crazy and thinks zombies are friends in fact she kills her sister so she can have a fun sister zombie friend oh god what do you do here and it's the famous scene look at the flowers as carol puts her down daryl winds up with beth who is maggie's younger sister she tried to kill herself in season two but now she's a hard survivor so far though she's been a bit of a background character mostly just holds judith while rick's busy she and daryl find some moonshine so they get drunk and have a big fight then have a good cry then burn their house down you know as you do they get separated though when beth is abducted by a random car and more on that later maggie and glenn got separated too by the way last season he stole an engagement ring from a zombie and proposed cute she's off looking for him but turns out glenn was still at the prison there he finds tara one of the sisters the governor befriended she's the snarky one they work together to escape and soon find a new group abraham's a funny bad-mouthed military guy rosita's his cool sexy girlfriend eugene apparently is a top scientist who abraham's taken to dc to help cure the zombie apocalypse but it's like really the guy with the mullet long story short all our groups find maps to terminus and reunite there it's a happy friendly place here have a burger i promise we aren't cannibals turns out though they are cannibals and our group's on the menu so in season 5 things look bleak as our group's about to be butchered but at the last second boom explosion yes carol and tyrese were late to the party and quickly discerned the situation so carol goes full commando mode and single-handedly bloom blasts a hole in terminus that's just the distraction our group needed they all escape and leave terminus a smoking ruin so are groups back on the road pretty soon they find a priest father gabriel who's got a nice secluded church with a bunch of canned food right then though terminus comes back for revenge but our group takes them out immediately abraham tells the rest of the group about their mission how eugene's a top scientist they have to get to dc and he can cure the zombie apocalypse and it's like wow this is great this must be the start of the main plot where our group saves the world our group splits up for now though because they have to go save beth beth was brought to a hospital where doctors and cops are still playing dress-up but this place is also secretly devious and she's a prisoner here very long story short they do a hostage exchange but beth's like hey you're evil and stabs her then oh get shot in the head no they were so close r.i.p beth the dc mission's also a failure they immediately run into car trouble and pretty soon eugene is forced to admit he's not actually a top scientist he's just a regular nerd when he saw this big beefy guy used a bunch of big words to convince him to be his bodyguard that's right curing the zombie apocalypse is not where this show's going the zombies are here to stay so now our group has no clear destination they try this one neighborhood where tyrese gets bit no they try to amputate but it was too late to rip tyrese and now our group has hit rock bottom no vehicles no food or water wandering the earth without purpose or direction the imagery of this shot exposes the duality of the title the walking dead referring not just to the reanimated corpses but to our survivors themselves and in case you didn't pick up on that rick says it five minutes later but now we meet a stranger who's this nerdy justin timberlake looking guy he's like hey guys my name's aaron you can come join my nice safe community but it's like no offense bub the last people who said that tried to eat us but the group's got to check it out and so we've made it to alexandria it's an upscale virginia neighborhood that's been totally unscathed because right at the beginning they built giant walls and it's not run by cannibals or an unhinged megalomaniac the leader is this nice woman deanna she videotapes rick to document his sexy apocalypse beard because this place was designed to be self-sustaining it runs on its own grid they've got power and water so yeah nothing devious here just people that got really lucky rick's like hey they're all soft if we don't like how they do things we'll just take it from them they had to turn in all their guns but carol puts on an act as the meek housewife again bakes cookies for everyone so no one suspects her of unlocking the armory and stealing some back carl's a teenager now and he meets a teenage girl enid she came in from the outside too and is also having trouble adjusting she has a motto jss just survive somehow and so naturally these two form a romance rick gets a love interest too but turns out she has an abusive husband but rick's not standing for that he's gonna murder this guy in the town square deanna's like whoa rick we don't do that here but rick pulls out a gun and gives an unhinged rant about how they're all too soft shane would be proud so michonne knocks him out for his own good so diana wants to kick rick out but father gabriel doesn't understand how locks work so zombies get in but rick saves the day like hey you guys need me just then randomly morgan is back he's a pacifist now who's taking a bow never to kill again so he fights with a stick the least lethal of all weapons so season six begins when our group finds a big zombie herd luckily they've got a good plan on how to hurt it away from alexandria but some loud noises draws the herd right towards it cause alexandria is under attack by a group of raiders called the wolf pack rick gets back just in time but alexandria is surrounded glenn is still out there trapped on a dumpster but this guy opts for a quick death and like a douchebag takes glenn down with him no not glenn oh r.i.p glenn just kidding actually five episodes later we find out glenn's okay he hid under the dumpster some more of our crew is still outside sasha and abraham start flirting in fact soon they end up together abraham dumps rosita but for now they find a rocket launcher daryl makes friends with the married couple dwight and sherry but they're on the run from another bad group and decide to jack his motorcycle and crossbow at alexandria the situation's grim brick and family tried the old-fashioned guts trick to try to sneak on out of there but it only works if you act like a zombie and this kid draws too much attention to himself gets eaten and then rick's girlfriend screams too all her other son blames rick so michonne's got to stab him but he fires and hits carl in the eye coral so with the stealth mission a complete failure it's time for plan b kill all the zombies our group are pros but they're getting overwhelmed luckily just then the cavalry comes back with a convenient gas truck and a rocket launcher luckily zombies are dumb they all walk into the fire and alexandria is not a smoking ruin they manage to rebuild carl's fine too he gets to wear an eye patch now which just makes him look cooler rick and michonne living as platonic roommates but one day it's not so platonic these two get it on and they're together the rest of the series so life is good for a bit and things are quiet but soon we meet a new character who's a kung fu master people call him jesus for obvious reasons he's a friendly guy and he's here as an envoy from another survivor's community the hilltop they've got a lot of food but they don't have any guns and there's a gang who calls themselves the saviors that are taking half their stuff every week rick's like hey no sweat my people are very good at killing so they go to the savior outpost and slaughter them all but soon after the road is blocked by a couple more saviors and turns out every road is blocked by even more saviors this gang might be bigger than we thought soon our group is surrounded on their knees in the woods and it's time to meet the big man himself it's negan he wears a leather jacket and carries a baseball bat loose seal he's a smiley charismatic type of psychopath and man does he love to hear himself talk he explains he's not going to kill them all he needs them alive so he can take half their stuff every week but to make a point he's got to kill one of them right now he's going to pick randomly and season 6 ends on a cliffhanger we don't see who it is but you're watching the recap you don't have to wait to find out that he picks abraham no oh r.i.p abraham daryl's not having this he tries to fight back but that's against the rules and for his insolence sneakin's gonna kill another one no glenn no not glenn he was the best of us been around since episode one and his wife maggie is pregnant but negan don't care he kills him brutally and so in season seven they spend the first half of the season at the mercy of negan's whims you never know if he's gonna cook you spaghetti or cut your guts out but finally rick has had enough it's time to fight back the leader of hilltop is this slimy politician gregory but the people of hilltop find a new leader in maggie yeah she's been living there since she was pregnant and they had a doctor and she's proven herself to be leadership material but we'll need more allies for this fight so it's time to meet the kingdom so named because their leader is the king king ezekiel who's really committed to the character of a fantasy king jerry is his best friend and loyal bodyguard who's just having fun with it his other bodyguard is shiva his pet tiger carol's like what show am i on ezekiel's actually a normal chill dude though he just used to do community theater and was a zookeeper and he's got a crush on carol eventually these two get together but the kingdom is also under the thumb of the saviors and so long story short rick convinces them to join them there's also oceanside a coastal community of all women because the saviors killed all their men so now they don't like strangers long story short tara befriends them although they don't actually agree to help fight our group kind of just takes their guns then there's the trash people a bunch of goths who live in the dump and have very quickly developed their own strange culture but rick eventually convinces them to join too now the savior home base is a big scary industrial building called the sanctuary daryl is a prisoner there for a while and soon negan takes eugene too earlier he found out that eugene's a smartypants who knows how to manufacture bullets he wants eugene to make bullets for him but ideally not as a prisoner as a full-blown member of negan's gang with all the rights and privileges that entails when eugene sees the price of disloyalty he's like yup negan i'm in all the way and he starts to really enjoy his position of power as chief engineer another of negan's top lieutenants is dwight the guy who stole daryl's motorcycle and crossbow apparently negan caught them and forced jerry to become one of his wives and ex-boyfriends of negan's wives get hot ironed to the face so that's what happened to dwight obviously dwight hates negan but he's been broken there's nothing left in him but obedience but one day sherry escapes so dwight goes back to their home but she's left him a note i didn't know if you turned me back into negan so i'm not here and it's tragic cause he wasn't gonna he brought beer and pretzels like they always said they would so after this dwight finds our crew like hey negan's gotta go down i'll be your man on the inside so soon negan rolls up in force to punish their disobedience sasha was captured earlier so he threatens to execute her but well she's already dead yeah she pleaded to eugene for help but the help he gave her was a suicide pill but she figured what the heck i'll turn myself into a weapon and oh she almost gets negan r.i.p sasha but now rick has the trash people on his side but oh they double-cross him negan made him a better offer and so once again rick is on his knees and to teach him a lesson this time negan's gonna kill carl but oh tiger attack yes hilltop in the kingdom arrive just in time chase negan off for now and now the triple alliance is ready for all-out war so in season 8 it's zombie apocalypse warfare time which sometimes involves just wasting a lot of bullets but there's other cool stuff like armored cars and using zombie herds against your enemies it's kind of a convoluted season a lot of back and forth but the most noteworthy things the king's tiger dies shiva father gabriel loses sight in one eye and morgan gives up on his no killing bow he starts killing everyone again maybe there's a middle ground there but the biggest loss of them all is carl he got bit no coal yes even though he's a seasoned zombie killer now it's always dangerous sometimes you get bit r.i.p carl now they still have dwight as an inside man and one day he leaked some plans but turns out negan knew he was a traitor and gave him fake plans so our group walks into an ambush and are totally surrounded now the saviors have plenty of bullets left because eugene's been manufacturing them but now at the last battle they all backfire yes eugene finally grew a spine and a conscience and saved the day so our group easily wins the day rick has his final showdown with negan the question is what to do with the other saviors but rick goes into mercy mode gives an impassioned speech about how the living need to stick together because the real enemy is the dead and indeed many of these saviors become valued members of the group like this nice guy alden in fact rick lets negan live too yeah he sentences him to prison for life to prove that they're the good guys morgan renews his vows of non-violence and decides to cross over to fear the walking dead and become the new main character over there and dwight goes back to find that sherry liked his offering of beer and pretzels she says come find me so they go off to fear too so in season nine the good guys won and the future looks bright maggie though is not happy that negan's still alive she's gonna kill him but when she sees how much he hates being locked up she's like never mind i'm gonna leave you here to rot so life in the zombie apocalypse is pretty good now with all the communities working together until the bridge that connects them all finally collapses so rick has got to lead a massive construction project one day though rick runs into some zombie trouble and oh ends up in a bad situation trying to make it home but instead he leads the horde right to the bridge he's gotta stop him from crossing so the dynamite he's gonna take the shot oh rick grimes boom blows the bridge and himself up all the ultimate sacrifice to save the communities miraculously though rick survives and in fact he's found just then by the leader of the trash people jadis there's been a whole mystery with her she's in communication with some super group that has helicopters in fear the walking dead and the world beyond we learn a little bit about this group the civic republic military the crm they're gonna give her a ride in exchange for a prisoner so she's like well that was a freebie so rick grimes our main character flying off the show on a helicopter off to a whole new series of adventures in theoretically his own spin-off movies we immediately cut to a whole new group of characters having some zombie trouble when they're saved by a little girl with rick and carl's sheriff's hat yes this is a grown-up judith grimes we've had a time jump alexandria is still prospering they have a windmill now but they're not very friendly these days they went through some bad stuff during the time jump in fact they've been out of contact with the other communities rick's bridge was never rebuilt this new group is magna the hot-headed one yumiko the cool level-headed one incidentally these two are dating there's also connie who's deaf and her sister kelly and luke the funny music nerd they quickly proved themselves to be capable survivors and yeah they're fighting with slingshots and bow and arrows eugene's bullet factory didn't work out i guess and now a decade after the start of the zombie apocalypse there's no ammo left there's also no gas left we don't do cars anymore we're riding horses over at the kingdom carol has grown out long hair and is officially married to king ezekiel they adopted this kid henry who's been training in morgan's way of the stick but the kingdom is starting to fall apart ezekiel's trying to organize an inner community fair to bring everyone back together so carol and henry go on an adventure and their first stop is the old hermit of the woods obi-wan daryl kenobi he never stopped looking for rick grimes he's been living out here by himself this whole time well not totally by himself because he has a dog now named dog eventually we get a flashback to see how they met he belonged to a woman leia and she and daryl fell in love but one day she too disappeared without a trace maybe that'll come up later now the hilltop is also thriving but maggie's not the leader anymore in fact she left the show she met a woman named georgie who's apparently an expert on medieval technologies and drives around the country teaching people how to build windmills and stuff maggie was like hey i could use a change of scenery i'm coming with you and big bad negan is not very scary anymore he's befriended young judith grimes and is just the funny man that lives under the stairs but in six years no one taught father gabriel how to lock a gate and so one day the negan is friggin he goes on a bit of a walkabout but realizes there's nothing out here for him anymore he just goes back to his cell later during a blizzard he risks his life to save judith and dog yes negan is trying for a redemption arc now the main problem this season begins when rosita and eugene run into a zombie herd but this is no normal herd because the zombies are whispering to each other smart talking zombies are they evolving what the butt our crew ends up cornered in a cemetery and they are expert zombie slayers but not when they dodge then stab you with a knife all these new walkers are terrifying turns out though they're not smart evolved walkers they are just people who wear zombie masks yes this group is called the whisperers and they've taken the guts trick to the extreme they wear zombie faces and live among them full time luckily they're a lot less scary when they don't have the element of surprise and soon our group takes one prisoner this young girl named lydia she's like hey please don't send me back they are awful especially their leader my mother alpha she's a cult leader like figure who's been completely broken by the zombie apocalypse and eventually we learn the whispers have no reasonable motivation their motto is we are the end of the world alpha has completely rid herself of human emotions in fact she's abusive to her daughter to make her stronger but daryl's not gonna stand for that he's leading a rescue mission with stickboy henry who in a very quick time formed a romance with lydia so on the day of the inter-community fair everyone's having a great time including some whisperers in disguise they end up capturing a bunch of our group and reveal their true power alpha has a absolutely massive zombie horde that her people are controlling she's like look if you guys cross into our territory we'll unleash it on ya and to mark the border of that territory heads on pikes yes alpha killed like a dozen minor characters in one fell swoop but also some bigger ones like enid yeah carl's old girlfriend who's an adult now and started dating nice savior alvin r.i.p enid and tara who's been around for a long time now and grew into the leader of hilltop r.i.p tara and say it ain't so it's stick boy henry tennis years after carol lost sofia she's right back here again so now in season 10 our group is at the mercy of the whisperers for now they seem to have a cold war standoff kind of tense peace but more bad things start happening is this coincidence or is it the whisperers leads to unrest in the community silence the whispers graffiti a lot of this hate is unfairly directed at lydia so she goes to another outcast for advice it's negan yes he's allowed out of his cell these days for good behavior and he really befriends lydia here becomes her uncle negan one night some people try to kill lydia but negan's there to save her unfortunately he pushed this one way too hard and killed her that definitely violates his parole the council votes to finally just execute him but before they can someone's let him out of his cell negan is friggin once again and now he goes to alpha like hey they were going to execute me let me join you although negan's not a good fit for the whisperers this guy really loves to hear himself talk back at alexandria there's a new baby yes it's rosita's she's dating father gabriel these days and somewhere along the line he became kind of a badass but father gabriel is not the father it's actually siddique who rosita was dating before him he's alexandria's doctor and a real good guy but he's been having ptsd lately because he was with the whisperers when they beheaded everyone and made him watch luckily a new doctor joined the group this nice guy dante who's here to help out but when dante comes to comfort him he does the tongue click tick which sadiq remembers the whisperer that was holding him down also did dante's an undercover whisperer and he kills him are a piece of deak one day this season michonne meets this guy virgil who's like hey i've got an island off the coast with a bunch of weapons that can help you fight the whisperers but long story short he has no weapons he's crazy but michonne does find a cell phone that apparently belongs to rick grimes the first clue they've had in all this time so michonne says goodbye to her stepdaughter judith and her and rick's son rick jr all so cute mama's going back into badass mode to bring your daddy home and so michonne leaves the show to go find rick which now just leaves bffs daryl and carol as the last two standing from the first three seasons this season carol wants revenge on alpha for killing henry and makes some pretty reckless moves while trying to kill her one day she chases alpha who leads our group down into a mine shaft where she is hiding her massive zombie horde our group finds the exit but carol plants some dynamite which does not destroy the herd but does trap magna and connie this is sad for daryl he and connie had been really hitting it off she does make it out by the end of the season but our group doesn't find her yet and now finally the time has come alpha's unleashing her full horde whisperer negan has quickly risen the ranks in fact one day she's like hey man want a bang he's like well it's been a while i'm in but tell me you're taking the zombie mask off and she does not so yeah that happens and now it's time for the battle of hilltop the commander is aaron yeah remember nerdy justin timberlake well he lost a boyfriend then lost an arm so he's had a drastic transformation now with a sexy apocalypse beard and a medieval weapon for an arm and yeah without guns our group goes full game of thrones they're putting up a valiant fight but the whispers make tree sap bombs and leave hilltop a smoking ruin after the battle alpha finally lets her guard down around which is just what he was waiting for because negan oh assassinates alpha sorry girl you're kinda hot but you're too crazy and he delivers her head to the person who let him out of a cell just for this purpose it's carol yeah this was part of her long game to finally avenge henry and negan was hoping to earn some points on his redemption arc so he could be an accepted part of the group anyone who was there will never fully forgive him but at least they accept he's on their side for now but alpha had a right-hand man this giant beta who is an absolute monster so he rounds up the zombie horde and is coming for revenge it's the whisperers round two beta boogaloo he goes into alexandria with no resistance our group evacuated to a more defensible location pretty soon he tracks them down and so they make their final stand things look bleak but some reinforcements arrived who's this crazy ninja guy in a mask turns out he's a new friend of maggie yes she's back on the show it's a long story short daryl kills beta and they lead the horde off a cliff the whisperers are defeated but life goes on there's always new problems eugene had been reaching out on the radio looking for other communities and one day someone answers and it sounds like a hot girl yeah eugene has a new radio girlfriend stephanie and they make plans to meet up so he recruits a few chaperones into the booty call crew along the way they meet a zany new
