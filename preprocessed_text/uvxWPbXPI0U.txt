The movie opens with photo\xe2\x80\x99s showing a loving family. A beautiful wife and beautiful kids in a stereotypical suburban American home, with a few more quirks dotted around the house. We then join Keanu Reeves, playing Evan, fooling around in bed with his stunning wife before they are interrupted by their two children to wish Evan a Happy Father\xe2\x80\x99s Day. A Beautiful little family. We see a loving father, with a loving family. Karen, Evans\xe2\x80\x99s wife and kids are set to go away for the Weekend while Evan has to stay home and work. Lewis a family friend drops off some books that Karen has had produced. A statue arrives for the garden before the family leave to go to the sea, while Evan and their dog stay home alone. They drive off for a lovely weekend. That night sees a heavy thunderstorm, Evan is listening to music while home alone and working on his computer when his family facetime him. From outside the house, you are given the impression someone is looking inside, but you don\xe2\x80\x99t know who. While back at work designing a house and having a smoke the music goes off and he hears a knock at the front door. When he opens the door, he is presented with two stunning young ladies who have been drenched in the current downpour. They ask for a family name that he\xe2\x80\x99s unaware of, they claim a taxi had dropped them off and they are lost. One of the ladies\xe2\x80\x99 sneezes and he hands her a handkerchief, before allowing them to come in and use his phone. They then ask to use his computer, which he agrees. When inside, he goes to grab them some towels to dry off as well as an iPad to help them find the address they are looking for. Bell introduces herself while Genesis uses the iPad. Within moments Bell starts to flirt with Evan, which he seems oblivious to. They claim the address they wanted is miles away and Evan orders them an Uber which will be 45 minutes. They ask to throw their clothes in to Evans\xe2\x80\x99s dryer, which he awkwardly agrees too before grabbing them some robes. Both ladies join Evan, who is making them a hot drink while they are in their new robes. He puts their clothes in the dryer, when he returns, they are dancing to music and playing with the family dog, called Monkey. Evan\xe2\x80\x99s tells the ladies he used to be a DJ when he was younger and that he is now 43. He tells them his family are away at present before the ladies come in for a hug making him feel uncomfortable and continue to flirt with him. They look at a picture of Karen while they look at all the sculptures she created. The flirting continues and Bell swiftly turns the conversation to Sex and how he must do it all the time with his wife. Evan tries to shrug off the flirting while the Uber is still 20 minutes away. Genesis and Bell try and make threesomes a normal thing and that being with only one person isn\xe2\x80\x99t natural. They tell Evan they are both flight attendants as they continue to flirt. You can see in Evan\xe2\x80\x99s eyes he is starting to fall for their flirtatious selves, with the uber only 5 minutes away Genesis goes to the bathroom. Bell has Evan put on a different piece of music; she starts to dance in a provocative manner all while Evan\xe2\x80\x99s eyes are drawn to her. He starts to show off his DJ skills as she dances for him. Bell pulls Evan in to dance as she tells him how good of a time they are all having, she removes her gum as she goes in to kiss him. He pulls away at the last second, just as the Uber arrives. Evan grabs their clothes, as he gives them the clothes, they are both naked in the shower waiting for him. As they continue to touch him, he tries to stop them time and time again, but soon he comes under their seduction and ends up sleeping with them both, first in the shower and then in the family bed. We then cut to Evan in bed with them both asleep. In the morning Evan is in bed alone, he wakes up, his wedding ring on the sideboard and missed messages from his wife. He hoes to find both Bell and Genesis, he approaches them in a rage as they are making breakfast in his kitchen and acting very childish. The kitchen has been trashed as they continue to act like children and referring to him as daddy. He takes a call from his wife in the garden as both Bell and Genesis try and distract him. He returns inside in anger, trying to get them both to leave, which is proving extremely difficult. Bell continues to try and seduce him as he\xe2\x80\x99s trying to get them to leave. He waits outside for them both, but they don\xe2\x80\x99t show up. He finds them damaging his wife\xe2\x80\x99s statue. As he tries to call their parents, they tell him they are both only 15 and that if he calls anyone they will tell them he is a predator. Telling him he will get minimum 15 to 20 years in prison. They tell him they lied about being flight attendants. He tries to pay them to leave. They tell him they are not hookers. Viviane, a family friend arrives, but he tells her she can\xe2\x80\x99t come in, it\xe2\x80\x99s then Genesis comes out while caressing him. She leaves in anger. Back inside Evan is angry and tries to force them to leave. In anger he starts to choke Genesis, but she tells him he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have it in him before he releases her. He\xe2\x80\x99s notably upset and frustrated. Evan calls 911, but Genesis hangs up the phone before asking for a ride. After an awkward car ride, he drops them off at what he believes is their home. As soon as they are out of the car he drives off. They don\xe2\x80\x99t enter the house but swiftly walk away. Evan cleans up his family home as if nothing had happened, trying to forget the previous night. He finishes cleaning up his home and returns to work. He hears a noise and investigates, now paranoid. In the room he see\xe2\x80\x99s a family photo smashed on the floor; it\xe2\x80\x99s then Genesis knocks him unconscious from behind with a sculpture. They tie him to the bed; he wakes up as Genesis is doing her makeup. He can\xe2\x80\x99t get free as he claims he\xe2\x80\x99s a good person. He can\xe2\x80\x99t free himself. Bell joins him wearing his daughters school uniform and calling him Daddy. She removes her underwear before standing over him. He asks to be untied as Bell tells him she loves him as Genesis doesn\xe2\x80\x99t. He can\xe2\x80\x99t free himself. He continues to beg to be freed. Genesis writes \xe2\x80\x98It was not a dream\xe2\x80\x99 on the mirror as Bell slaps Evan. It\xe2\x80\x99s then they hear his phone that he\xe2\x80\x99s laid on.

Bell joins them and tells him he must be punished. They tie Evan to a chair and pretend to play a game. They then torture him with noises, nearly damaging his hearing. The questions and the punishment continue, asking him questions about how he should be punished, including prison or death, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t answer. It\xe2\x80\x99s then Lewis turns up at the door. They cover Evan up. Lewis enters the house and Genesis pretends she is their filming a music video, which Lewis believes. As Lewis goes outside to collect the sculpture, he finds it covered in paint and damaged. He starts to panic and needs his inhaler.

As Evan watches on they turn Lewis\xe2\x80\x99s body into a sculpture and send a fake message from Evan to Lewis, telling him he will kill him if he sleeps with his wife again and that he better disappear. They then load Lewis\xe2\x80\x99s body into his own van. They then want to continue the \xe2\x80\x98gameshow\xe2\x80\x99. They tell him how much of a bad person he is for sleeping with them and that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t deserve his family. They tell him he deserves death for his actions. He gets angry and starts to blame them for what happened. He tells them he tries to be a good guy, but that they seduced him. They then tell him he will be executed at Dawn before Bell calls him Daddy yet again. Bell and Genesis then dig what appears to be a grave in the back garden. While looking on Evan sees his iPad and tries to get it. He uses voice control to try and call his wife, as it starts calling, they return and throw it in the garden. They then admit to spying on Evan prior to the night they arrived at his house. They change into new clothes and destroy more statues in the garden as time swiftly ticks by.
