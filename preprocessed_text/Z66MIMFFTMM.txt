everyone its definition. here with another unboxing review. at this time I've got the Wonder Woman box, so no one's coming out it. so first bit, it's the Wonder Woman box. the pins falling. [Music] paper. so, you know, it's telling me everything. we also got some Wonder Woman socks. they can go out the window. next one's the Funko pop. very rare Funko pop. I don't really collect them myself, but I'm sure you know, a little kids love that. there's only little kids collect them. your girlfriend called some dust collectors. fine size heroes. not the size of a pint, if that's what they call a pint in America. no wonder they're all lightweight. ha, ha, ha. just a little little joke about my American cousins. don't unsubscribe a few from America. and the final pop is a Wonder Woman 1. this box, we get two Funko pops in. like I said, don't collect them up in that job again. and, well, you're really happy with that one. that's definitely one that's right up my street. when you collect these things, you haven't got much chance of ever seeing a real woman, so it could have little plastic ones instead. if you want to check out my Wonder Woman review or my comic reviews? come look over here. come look over here. i'm reviewing all these comics on my website at definition cora UK. and we read through all the Batman ones from start to finish at the moment, and sort of work another Justice League, new 52 ones. so I'd appreciate it if you check that out. click subscribe, or I'll find it, and I'll put a box in your head, like boxing. anyway, take care. bye.
