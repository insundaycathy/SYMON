Welcome back for another 5 minute movie recap. Today, I'm going to give you an overview of the 2018 British-American science fiction horror film called 'Annihilation'. There will be Spoilers ahead, so please proceed with caution. After returning as the lone survivor of an expedition to an abnormal zone known as the 'Shimmer,' cellular biology professor and Army veteran Lena is questioned in a top-secret US government facility code-named Area X. The Shimmer formed three years ago from a meteoroid that crashed inside a lighthouse on the southern United States' coast, and it is steadily spreading its limits. Kane, Lena's Green Beret spouse, was a member of a previous expedition and returns at their house after a year, unable to explain where he was or how he returned. As his health worsens, Lena summons an ambulance, but it is stopped by security personnel and brought to Area X. Dr. Ventress, a government psychologist, shows Lena the Shimmer while Kane is in intensive care and says that numerous exploratory teams have entered, but only Kane has ever returned. Ventress is getting ready to lead a new research expedition into the Shimmer, with Lena, physicist Josie Radek, geomorphologist Cassie 'Cass' Sheppard, and paramedic Anya Thorensen as members. When the party enters the Shimmer, Lena gets a vision of a previous romance she had with a coworker, which took place before Kane's disappearance. When the party awakens in their tents, they discover that their communications and navigation devices have stopped working, that three to four days have passed, and that they have no recollection of what happened after they entered the Shimmer. They come across mutant flora and animals, and Josie survives an attack by an albino alligator with rows of shark-like fangs. They discover a video message from Kane's expedition at an abandoned military camp, showing him doing field surgery on another soldier's abdomen only to see his intestines moving on their own. Given the way the organs are distributed, the soldier's corpse appears to have evolved into an enlarged colony of lichens. A mutant bear attacks the base at night, dragging Cass away, and Lena later discovers her mangled corpse. They come discover plants that have taken on human-like shapes as they arrive at an abandoned town. According to Josie, the Shimmer acts as a prism for all kinds of information, including DNA, distorting and changing anything inside its bounds, and the group is already starting to change. After witnessing her fingerprint patterns alter, Anya becomes paranoid and ties up the others, accusing Lena of murdering Cass. The bear entices Anya away by imitating Cass's call for assistance, then enters the room with the ladies and threatens them. Anya, who is hurt, arrives and shoots the bear, who kills her by ripping her mouth off. Josie manages to free herself and kills the bear with a shotgun. Ventress, who is dying of cancer and is desperate to discover the truth about the Shimmer before she dies, sets out on her own for the lighthouse. The Shimmer's 'refractions' are already within Josie and Lena's bodies; Josie expresses her belief that Cass's dying consciousness was 'refracted' into the bear and walks off, as her body turns into plant stuff. Lena arrives at the lighthouse to find Kane's corpses and another video message, assuming he accepted the suicide expedition into the Shimmer because she cheated on him. Kane instructs the man filming to find Lena and then kills himself with an incendiary bomb; the other man is shown to be an extraterrestrial doppelg\xc3\xa4nger who took Kane's place. Ventress says that the powers underlying the Shimmer will expand to encompass all as Lena sinks through the hole left by the meteor. She then disintegrates into a luminous nebulous structure that takes a drop of blood from Lena's face, transforming into a humanoid creature that moves like Lena. In order to get away from the creature that is mirroring her, Lena throws one of her phosphorous grenades at it, and it changes into an exact replica of herself. Lena detonates the grenade and runs away from the lighthouse, but the monster does not pursue her. The monster, which has been set fire by the explosion, tenderly caresses Kane's charred body before crawling back into the hole and burning the lighthouse's core. As the Shimmer's constructions crumble and fade away, Lena stands there watching. Lena's interrogator at the institution claims that the Shimmer would have destroyed everything in the end. Lena disagrees, claiming that the Shimmer was genuinely attempting to build something (presumably new life forms through the information prism). When she takes a drink from a glass of water, the droplets on the edge of the glass travel sideways and mix with one other. After the Shimmer faded, the interviewer reports that Kane has physically healed and is once again lucid. Lena pays him a visit and inquires whether he is Kane; he responds, 'I don't believe so.' He inquires whether she is Lena, but she remains silent. Kane wraps his arms around Lena, and their eyes shimmer. If you like this movie, click the link in the description below to watch it today.
