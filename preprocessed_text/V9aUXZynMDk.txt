Then came and told Yi to come to Leopold's family room because they wanted to meet Leopard's designs praising the great action that ASEAN had done earlier  but taste  His curiosity made him eager to reveal the secret of I'm's trick. Therefore he asked the Essaim to come to his palace to do another illusion trick. Ijen Hai gladly accepted the invitation from Prince Leopold and before Leopard and Sofie left the room Ice  nine promised to put on a show that was more interesting than the previous show and he said that he would eliminate Leopold Hearing this Sofi immediately realized that Eisenheim was Edward, her lover who had been away from Vienna for a long time outside the stage Ijen hem who was walking home with his manager asked  to his manager about the relationship between Leopard and Sofie it was known that Sofi was Leopold's future wife and they would soon get married in the near future but the manager said that trouble was a cruel crown prince and even rumored that he had killed a woman and then covered up the woman's death the next day Ijen Hai got a letter from someone asking him to meet in a horse carriage, it turned out to be a letter from Sofi asking Eisenheim to meet in secret.

He then asked several people from the audience to try to pull out the sword but none of them managed to do it until finally Leopold who really wanted to dismantle Hai's trick tried to do it himself but he couldn't pull out his sword either. he feels that he has been abused by I'm because he can't draw his own sword which means that he doesn't deserve to be a king Leopold settles eisenheim he gives a code to revoke his magic so that he is not humiliated in front of his entire family and kindly Ijen Hai  released his magic and Leopold managed to pull out his sword. Aise Hain's performance this time really annoyed Leopard and because of that he asked the Inspector to immediately close Eisenheim's theater.
