\xef\xbb\xbfIf your \xe2\x80\x98friend\xe2\x80\x99 led you into an uncharted cave inhabited by man-eating half-humans, what would you do? In this How to Beat video, we\xe2\x80\x99ll follow the amateur cavers, see if we can make better decisions, and ultimately attempt to beat the Crawlers in, The Descent.  Think you can do better, let us know in the comments! Enjoy these How to Beat videos, like and subscribe! Have a movie you\xe2\x80\x99d like me to cover, reply to this comment!  Let\xe2\x80\x99s get to it. We start out following three sassy adventurous ladies white water rafting. After they break through the rapids, Paul shares a moment with Juno before driving home with his wife and daughter. He starts daydreaming about slowly taking off Juno\xe2\x80\x99s wetsuit while behind the wheel, and veers out of his lane.  That was some final destination shit. Paul may have cheated death prior to this, but honestly, it was straight up his fault for daydreaming about checking out his wife\xe2\x80\x99s friend. He should have saved those thoughts for later when his wife and kids weren\xe2\x80\x99t in the car with him.  Still, who the hell thought strapping an open PVC pipe to their roof and loading it with a bunch of copper rods was a good idea. They\xe2\x80\x99re definitely getting charged with manslaughter for catapulting half a dozen metal javelins through Paul and Jessica\xe2\x80\x99s faces.  Sarah wakes up in a hospital bed clueless as to what happened. She rips off all the wires, tubes, and gadgets she\xe2\x80\x99s hooked up to so she can wander the hospital to find someone who can bring her up to speed. I think they have little buttons on the beds that alert the staff. You could just push that and not rip out all the important stuff that\xe2\x80\x99s probably keeping you alive.  Oh it was a PTSD nightmare. Yah, I guess it makes sense that you\xe2\x80\x99d be fairly distraught and impulsive. Junos gotta be feeling a little guilty about sending Sarah\xe2\x80\x99s husband bedroom eyes pre-crash.  One year after the \xe2\x80\x98incident\xe2\x80\x99, Sarah, Juno, and Beth get back together to go spelunking in the Appalachian mountains. They\xe2\x80\x99re joined by two inexperienced sisters, Sam and Rebecca, as well as Juno\xe2\x80\x99s half-reckless, adrenaline junky base jumper friend, Holly.  Holly laments that the cave they are to explore is just a tourist trap and offers no real challenges and probably has a gift shop in it. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t read the brochure for the cave-diving adventure you\xe2\x80\x99re embarking on, but I have read the synopsis of this movie, and I gotta say, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about the same cave.  Sarah seems resentful of Juno for ditching her the day after the crash, as she should be, and is obviously still traumatized by the horrific loss of her family. I mean, she\xe2\x80\x99s keeping antidepressants bedside to cope with her night terrors.  All this to say, taking Sarah spelunking with two noobs being led by the person she resents who will be encouraged to push their limits by her adrenaline-addict friend, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem like the greatest idea. Maybe it would be okay if the cave was a tourist trap with a gift shop inside, but I'm going to guess that it\xe2\x80\x99s unmarked or was sealed up by the locals for a grave reason that they will ignore.  Holly mentions that it\xe2\x80\x99s a level two cave in the fictional Boreham Caverns. I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure level 2 is even a thing. What cave they think they are headed into doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter because Juno left the guide book in the glove box for some stupid reason.  Worth mentioning that everyone in the group should have had a copy of the guide book or map of the cavern they are entering in case they get separated or lost, or yah know, so they can actually find their way around. On their 2 mile long hike to the entrance of the tourist trap, they run into the throat cut carcass of a bull elk. Nature, or bad omen?  They reach the entrance and everyone rappels in. Sarah notices what looks like a bloodstained handprint on the wall and neglects to tell anyone about it because it\xe2\x80\x99s probably nothing. Just like the elk was probably just attacked by a bear.  Sarah looked like she was about to get impaled by a copper rod. I still don\xe2\x80\x99t think bringing a PTSD stricken person cave diving was a good idea. Sam asks which way they need to go next. Juno replies that there\xe2\x80\x99s only one way out of this chamber. Down the pipe. Before hard hostering her.. ice climbing axe? Why does she have an ice climbing axe? Why is everyone following someone who brought an ice climbing axe into a cave that has no ice? If ice climbing axes were required tools for this expedition, why is Juno the only person with one? Not looking good here.  You know what would have been a good idea, bringing ascenders instead of a fucking ice climbing axe so you can climb out the way you came in incase the tunnel is blocked, flooded, your equipment fails, or you run into homicidal cave gollums. The cave very well could be flooded, with all the water pouring into it. I\xe2\x80\x99m also gonna take a hot guess that they didn\xe2\x80\x99t inform the park rangers, let alone anyone of their plans.  Once inside the cave, they light some flares and hangout for a few. Sarah hears the giggling of her deceased child and wanders off by herself to see if Jessica got a head start on them. Can\xe2\x80\x99t wait to see how she does in the claustrophobic confines of the next tunnel they have to go through.  Not well. Sarah gets stuck, both mentally and physically. Beth goes back and pretty much does everything right, tells her to breathe slowly, cracks some jokes, and tries to lead her out. The problem is that this cave is experiencing tectonic shifts for some reason.  Good thing nobody was on the other side, or wait, that would be bad, because they didn\xe2\x80\x99t bring any ascenders or let the park rangers know their whereabouts. According to Juno the only way out is down the pipe, so going back wasn\xe2\x80\x99t an option anyways.  According to the guidebook nobody brought, which from your memory contradicts what Juno said about there being only one way out. You didn\xe2\x80\x99t say anything at the time, and now you\xe2\x80\x99re here. Turns out, Juno was bullshitting them and led them down a different unmarked cave so that everyone would be dependent on her and she could play the fearless leader role.  Needless to say, it backfired hard. Leading a group of noobs into an unmarked, unmapped cave that nobody knows you are at, is unbelievably reckless. The fatal accident in the Nutty Putty Cave serves as a stark warning of this. Even in well mapped caves, with experienced cavers who had expert backup, a man still lost his way and got irretrievably stuck.  The fact that this is an unmapped cave means that there might not be a way out at all. Which means Juno is even more of an idiot, if that was possible, for not bringing ascenders to climb out the way they came. And Juno was concerned about Holly being reckless. Speaking of, if Holly had experienced Boreham Caverns previously, she must have known Juno was leading them elsewhere and didn\xe2\x80\x99t say anything. Both of you are untrustworthy bitches.  Still, it\xe2\x80\x99s not all on Juno and Holly. In caving, the consequences for entering the wrong cave are exceedingly high. Everyone should have been checking their guidebooks and making sure they were in the right area and going to the right cave.  Juno is right about one thing, if they stay, they die.  While everyone\xe2\x80\x99s fighting, Sarah is scouting around with her headlamp.  Strange, but she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t say anything. I could see her passing that off as more PTSD hallucinations or the darkness playing tricks on her eyes. The clicking sounds could be passed off as more bats or something. The journey deeper into the cave in search of an exit is halted by a gigantic underground precipice. Judging by the time it took for that rock to hit the ground, a fall would be fatal. Juno pops some flares and spots a tunnel across the cavern. Could be a dead end, but they don\xe2\x80\x99t really have any other options.  Rebecca volunteers to trad climb the overhang and rig up a line using cams. Nice of you to volunteer, and maybe you are the only trad pro here, but shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t the self-proclaimed badasses Juno or Holly be the default choice for this high-risk operation, considering they got you all into this mess.  I\xe2\x80\x99m not a trad climber, but I do rock climb and have some general experience. Firstly, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t clip a giant power drill on my harness when I'm traversing an overhang. The trad gear is heavy enough, and dead hanging from a ceiling is hard enough. Secondly, some of those cam placements in flared wedges look a bit sketchy, and she\xe2\x80\x99s not giving them a tug-check before placing her weight on them. I get she\xe2\x80\x99s limited on options though.  When she goes for her third cam placement, she finds an old bolt which had to have been placed by a human explorer. Might as well use it, even though you\xe2\x80\x99ll probably just be following them to the dead end where they died. If whoever explored this cavern had made it out, it would have been in the brochure. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I'm not being optimistic. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that explorer found a groundbreak just around the bend.  I\xe2\x80\x99d still place my own cam somewhere around it. Why solely trust your life to an old bolt some other dumbass who came down here placed. That was the first bolt she found on the overhang, meaning the other bolts they placed must have been shallow and zippered out on a fall.  Rebecca makes it across and rigs up a line that they can shuttle across. Juno is the last to cross. Instead of shuttling over like everyone else, she decides to clean the route in case they need the gear again.  Cleaning the route is a bit risky. Rebecca\xe2\x80\x99s cams were hastily placed and not to be relied upon. I think Juno should have shuttled across, and if they needed the gear again, they could just go back and clean it. This play does put you on the wrong side of another tunnel collapse though. Juno\xe2\x80\x99s struggling hard, looks like we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be finding out if those cam placements were solid or not.  What the hell was Rebecca doing? There is no reason the rope should have slipped her hand like that. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think her figure 8 belay device was set up properly, it doesn't look like the rope was looped around its neck. That and her hand wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in the brake position, which it should have been. Her belay gloves also suck because that little amount of rope slip caused enough friction burn to cut straight through her hand forcing her to dump the rope.  I want to say Juno was lucky she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t also relying on Rebecca\xe2\x80\x99s cams, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that bolt is any better.  Hey, at least you got your gear back. Further into the cavern they find a mural. How did the homo-sapien artist get up there to paint it, that\xe2\x80\x99s like 20 feet up on a smooth wall.  Beth remarks that it\xe2\x80\x99s a map. There\xe2\x80\x99s the mountain they\xe2\x80\x99re under, with the cave they are in and two exits. I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a bit of a stretch. Even if it\xe2\x80\x99s a map and there is an exit, there\xe2\x80\x99s no directions as to where the exit is.  Nobody notices Smeagol trailing them, so they blindly march onwards only to end up at a fork in the cave. Juno, using her lighter as a barometer, catches an air current in one of the passages, which means it likely leads to the surface. At least she\xe2\x80\x99s a clever idiot.  Holly, mistakes phosphorescent rock for daylight, takes the idiot baton from Juno and sprints down the corridor and falls into the mouth of another cave.  You dumb bitch. Escaping these tunnels would have been hard enough in full health. Now they have to haul you and your broken leg around too. At least they brought someone along with medical training. Well, she\xe2\x80\x99s a med student, so barely.  Sam has everyone hoist Holly out of the water and v. Getting her out of the water mostly helps them check for blood loss. Aligning the bone most likely wasn\xe2\x80\x99t necessary. Her leg could have been immobilized in its current position and manipulating her leg just caused more pain, writhing, and damage. It does provide a strong dramatic effect though.  Meanwhile, Sarah is tripping balls playing hide and seek with her dead daughter. She finds an old rusty miner\xe2\x80\x99s helmet which must have belonged to whoever put that bolt in.  Looks like he\xe2\x80\x99s not doing so well. Of course nobody believes her. Why would they? It sounds psychotic and Sarah\xe2\x80\x99s been known to have hallucinations.  Sarah has the total opposite reaction that I would expect. She wants to see if that man-thing she saw could help them find a way out. I don\xe2\x80\x99t even know what to say to that. If I was in this group, and someone told me that, sure I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe them, but I\xe2\x80\x99m going to place myself in the middle of the pack just in case. The crew continues to follow the air current, which leads to a room filled with the bones of dead animals, and probably some humans. I\xe2\x80\x99d say this is ample supporting evidence for Sarah\xe2\x80\x99s monster-sighting. Best start fashioning weapons out of the bones and anything else you can find.  Juno can\xe2\x80\x99t find a breeze and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know which way they need to go, so Sam and the others start yelling for help like imbeciles. Yah, good idea, let\xe2\x80\x99s attract the thing that\xe2\x80\x99s slaughtered hundreds of animals that were bigger, stronger, faster, and let\xe2\x80\x99s be honest, smarter than you.  Finding the way out is your last priority right now. The exit could be a mile from here or nonexistent. The last thing you want to do is line up in a single file in a confined space with these things attacking you. It would be better to all band up in the middle of the room with weapons in hand. You probably don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get up next to the wall with them climbing around like spider-monkeys. Wow, literally nobody stayed together. Now they\xe2\x80\x99re all easy targets to get picked off one by one. Juno puts up a hell of a fight against 2 of the gollums, and shanks one of them dead with her ice axe. Who knew that thing would come in handy.  Beth runs back to help Juno, but Juno\xe2\x80\x99s in full rage mode.  Probably shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have snuck up behind someone who just fought to the death. So many movies do the whole, friendlies almost kill each other, thing, but back down before a fatal blow it dealt. I\xe2\x80\x99m glad this movie took it there, because realistically, friendly fire happens a lot more than we\xe2\x80\x99d like to admit.  Rebecca\xe2\x80\x99s headlamp ran out of battery. Apparently she decided that instead of packing spare batteries, she\xe2\x80\x99d just bring a giant glow stick that\xe2\x80\x99s totally useless at lighting up the cave. So useless, that she unwittingly walked right under another crawler.  Now that there\xe2\x80\x99s a lull in the violence and the crawlers are distracted eating your friend..  ..it\xe2\x80\x99s a good time to assess their strengths and weaknesses. Strengths: Fast, good climbers, sharp teeth, sneaky. Weaknesses: They don\xe2\x80\x99t see so good, or Sarah would be dead.  Basically, shut the fuck up, pick up something you can use as a weapon, and no, the glow stick doesn\xe2\x80\x99t count, try to find your friends, try not to get separated from your friends, then try to quietly find a way out. The boneyard is proof that there is.  If you\xe2\x80\x99re feeling frisky, and a couple of you are together and have fashioned a shiv out of animal bones, you can bait the creatures in front of you by tossing stones, then spear them through the neck or chest. Sounds dangerous, but it\xe2\x80\x99s better to be the hunter than the hunted.  Or you could spoon each other in a corner while crying in hopes that your \xe2\x80\x98friends\xe2\x80\x99 make a noise which distracts the monsters long enough for you to attempt an escape.  Oh now everyone pulls out their ice axes and knives, where were those when you first got attacked?  Sarah also uses her friend's unintentional diversion to spark up a fire torch out of an old oil can on the ground. Clever, but I'm not going to award her any points for this. Having to be resourceful because of your piss poor planning means you\xe2\x80\x99re still an idiot. Any caver worth their salt would tell you to bring a couple spare sets of batteries at least.  Rebecca and Sam are trying to link up with the rest of their group. Difficult when you can\xe2\x80\x99t make any sound. Fuck yah. Honestly, these things aren\xe2\x80\x99t that hard to kill if you can group up on them. I say sitting on my comfy couch in an air conditioned apartment under zero threat of a gruesome death. They can hug it out somewhere else. The sounds of their fight and the crawler\xe2\x80\x99s screeching will attract more of them, and we don\xe2\x80\x99t know how many of them there are. Juno tells Rebeca and Sam about a way out, marked by the explorer that came before them. That it should lead them to the cave entrance which the man-eaters use to go outside and hunt animals. First, they need to find Sarah. Tall task, but it\xe2\x80\x99d be damn hard to live with yourself if you just left her.  Not sure why Juno holstered her ice axe. I\xe2\x80\x99d have that baby cocked back ready to strike. Although Juno has been a bit trigger happy with it, so maybe holstering it was a good idea.  Sarah finds Beth in the carnage. How the hell is she still alive? She took an ice axe through the neck. Beth tells her that Juno killed her, and to not trust her. I know Juno pulled a dick move dragging you guys into this cave, and wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the best friend, but to say that she is a murdering psychopath is crazy. You jumped up behind her when she was fighting for her life. You got caught in the cross-fire. It was just a shitty case of friendly fire.  Beth\xe2\x80\x99s lamentations are drawing the attention of the humanoids. Her dying wish is to have Sarah finish her off with a rock so she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to experience getting eaten alive.  Love each day. Sarah doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even make a step before another albino flesh eater descends on her. Sarah\xe2\x80\x99s in no mood for it\xe2\x80\x99s shit, and head stomps it like Ryan Gosling in Driver.  Best get some distance from the commotion now. You gotta shoot and scoot with these fuckers.  The caveman\xe2\x80\x99s girlfriend shows up for date night and finds what\xe2\x80\x99s left of his head after Sarah curb stomped him. Needless to say, she\xe2\x80\x99s pissed. Sarah makes a run for it and trips into the pond full of god knows what. Haven\xe2\x80\x99t we learned by now that running only makes things worse. Standing and moving so incredibly still that you become invisible is the best defense. And where is that pocket knife you had. She is smart to hold her breath, collect herself, and ever so slowly Navy SEAL out of the crawler\xe2\x80\x99s toilet so she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make more noise.  Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t help her though, the albino bat-bitch is onto her.  Pocket knife. Where\xe2\x80\x99s your god damn pocket knife? If everyone did a little preparation and planning they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to struggle for a hail mary everytime they found themselves in a near-death situation.  Sarah climbs up onto the rock and freezes when she hears another coming around the corner. It steps on her but thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s just another animal carcass and moves past her.  She carefully grabs another bone club and by the look in her eye, it\xe2\x80\x99s time for vengeance.  So the tally is 1 for the crawlers, and like 5 or 6 for the girls. As long as they have light, they have an immense tactical advantage. These creatures are only human, and have all the same weaknesses. Sarah lets out a bloodcurdling scream. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think she was doing it to get the attention of the others, however if she was, outright screaming isn\xe2\x80\x99t the best way. Your friends may just think you got whacked. Best to yell something like, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m Okay, Help Me.\xe2\x80\x9d This way they know you aren\xe2\x80\x99t a goner and it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a man-eater yelling or something. Juno and the others hear her scream and try to get to her, but when Juno turns the corner she finds an entire family of these things.  Juno\xe2\x80\x99s team is in a pretty good spot. The corridor is narrow enough that only one crawler can attack at once, but tall enough that she can stand and fight. She could pull a Leonidas and make this passage the proverbial hot gates. The last place you want to be is surrounded in the open, or forced into a crawl with them behind you. They opt to run for it but get forced back to the precipice. So instead of pulling a Leonidas, you guys pulled a persian.  Sam, in a utterly moronic move, tries to trad climb back across the overhang. There\xe2\x80\x99s just no way to fight in that position, it\xe2\x80\x99s physically demanding so you\xe2\x80\x99ll be making noise, it achieves literally nothing, and it goes about how you\xe2\x80\x99d expect.  At least she took one of them with her. They all keep forgetting that after every noisy altercation they need to relocate, and another crawler gives Rebecca an involuntary c-section. Juno\xe2\x80\x99s brain is misfiring from all the action, and ditches Rebecca to leap off the cliff into the water. She finds no salvation though.  You\xe2\x80\x99re telling me this thing was holding its breath this whole time after getting shanked and falling. Give me a break. Sarah jumpscare pulls Juno up from the slippery rocks. She\xe2\x80\x99s lucky her face didn\xe2\x80\x99t catch an ice axe.  Juno and Sarah go back to back tomb raider style against the rest of the crawler family.  Damn! Some badass ladies. If there\xe2\x80\x99s more of them, they are definitely on their way. Unless you plan on fighting some more, I suggest you get moving.
