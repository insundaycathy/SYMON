Shalom everyone! Welcome to Cinema Summary, ladies and gentlemen and may peace be with you because for a little Jewish village in Lithuania peace will be irreversibly disturbed now just so you know this video will be split into two sections a summary and an explanation if you haven't seen the movie yet keep on going for the summary if you have and you had some questions about a few things go to this time code on screen now for the answers and with that out of the way this is THE GOLEM in the year 1673 in an isolated agrarian village of  Lithuanian Orthodox Jews We follow Hannah who we first see is given a vial of contraceptives by Perla the villagers healer, now the thing is Hannah's a woman unlike any other in the village for a few reasons for one she has no child of her own as her son Joseph died seven years ago and she hasn't gotten over that and secondly she's sneaky, clever, and curious: hiding beneath the floors of the wooden yeshiva where the men studied the Talmud with the rabbi and because of this she's a very intelligent woman who was able to answer questions that not even the men can answer including her husband Benjamin, however the thing is with this knowledge and curiosity comes a thirst for the Kabbalah: forbidden, mystical knowledge which Hannah learns if harnessed correctly can allow one to create life though Benjamin warns her that such knowledge can drive even men insane who knows what it would do to a woman? the next day is the wedding day of Rebecca, Hannah's sister, and it's a beautiful ceremony that is interrupted by the arrival of Gentiles from a nearby village. They are led by Vladimir who has brought his sick plague-ridden daughter to the Jews who he believes caused his people to get sick and after killing one of them he forces them into a deal if they heal his daughter his people will leave him alone and won't kill them but if anyone leaves the village before his daughter is healed that person will die, and with that said he goes away taking Perla the with him to heal his daughter. Later that day, the men of the village plan for what is to be done when Hannah comes and suggests that they create a golem to protect the village, an idea that the rabbi finds preposterous and dangerous to do! So Hanna takes matters into her own hands after finding out her sister had a miscarriage after getting punched at her wedding, so she goes to the forest in the middle of the night to create a golem through a forbidden Kabbalic ritual and the next morning she finds the ritual site disturbed and is unsure if the ritual failed but things become strange as that night Hannah hears something in the attic while Benjamin sees his fiddle fall to the floor. Upstairs, Hanna finds that a doll is missing from a chest as well as a set of wet footprints that walk away from the chest and when Hanna comes downstairs Benjamin has found something: a small bottle of contraceptive that was hidden underneath her bed. You see since their son's death, Benjamin and Hannah have been trying for a new boy and Benjamin has just found out that Hanna has been sabotaging their efforts to move on and he angrily leaves Hannah alone as someone watches them from inside the house the following day, Hannah goes back to check the ritual site but is ambushed by Vladimir's men who lynch her but as she's choking she watches them get attacked by something and is cut down from the tree to see her savior It's the Golem! she takes it back home keeping it in the barm for the night while she reads more about golems finding out two particular details about them number one: golems are meant to only protect and safeguard for the greater good of all and number two: golems can evolve so keep these two points of information in mind as we go on throughout the film as these points are crucial to the progression of the story the motivations behind a specific character's actions and the consequences therein, alright? All right back to the movie from here on the events of the movie take place over a series of days and things become dark for everyone involved for one Hannah finds out that the Golem not only feels her emotions but that it will obey her will as we find out it kills Hannah's neighbor after Hanna gets jealous seeing her with Benjamin. Secondly the Golem kills anyone who seeks to destroy it as Benjamin finds Perla's corpse hidden in a chest after she tried to kill it and thirdly after Vladimir's men are killed and he is chased out of a village, Vladimir's daughter dies and he takes revenge against the village with his men who kill, raid, and burn the Jewish village and the villagers this ultimately leads to Benjamin working with the rabbi and some of the men in the village to destroy the golem which goes terribly wrong and ends in the golem going on a murderous rampage killing any Jew or Gentile with extreme prejudice before its attack is ended by Hannah who having realized the immense cost of her actions and finally able to move past her son's death, kills the golem by removing the scroll from its mouth leaving her with Benjamin as the few survivors of the massacre and the movie ends with the scroll the Hannah removed floating gently to the feet of Abigail, the daughter of Hannah's murdered neighbor so you probably have questions about a few things like why does Hannah's Golem look like a human if it's been established that golems look like giant rock monsters and why does that same golem go on a killing spree at the end of the film killing both Gentiles and Jews if it's supposed to protect them for the greater good of all and finally does Kabbalah truly drive people insane well let's take a few steps back to examine what's been established about Kabbalah in the film which for those of you who don't know is Jewish mysticism which can be understood as the study of the natural and the supernatural from a Jewish perspective in context Benjamin says that it can drive even men insane while his father the village rabbi remarks that only someone as legendary as Moses could ever control such a powerful thing this along with a psychic bond that Hannah has with the Golem I believe answers your question you see the Kabbalah is such a powerful force that not even the great in Maharal of Prague was able to successfully control it as we see in the beginning of the film. This inability to properly control kabbalah leads to an otherwise divine power being corrupted by human desire and imperfection, Hannah is established as having not gotten over her son's death and she clearly uses the golem child as a substitute for Joseph and as an unhealthy coping mechanism to deal with his death, in fact it's somewhat implied that she was trying to find a way to resurrect her son through the use of the Kabbalah and in a way the ritual she conducts does so although it takes into account her desire for vengeance against Vladimir in his men, her need to protect her people, and of course her son's resurrection or return so to speak inadvertently creating a golem that's unlike any before it: a golem that assumes a human shape as for why it goes on a murderous rampage at the end of the film I think that's in part due to the bond that the golem has with Hannah it's established in the movie that the Golem feels whatever Hannah feels and we see it very physically react with the same anger they Hannah feels when she sees her neighbor with Benjamin and we actually see the Golem itself experience its own jealousy when it sees the attention that Hanna gives Benjamin and it stabs itself in the thigh to hurt Hanna now from what I've read about golems in folklore and in legend they are essentially machines they have no thoughts of their own and they have no feelings of their own however as established in the film golems can evolve and they have a primary directive to protect for the greater good of all and the way that I see ii is that through this psychic bond the Golem molds itself to fulfill Hannah's desire but also develops its own emotions which corrupt its original purpose of protection so with this glitch in its system its prime directive of protecting the Jews is overwritten. The Golem adapting and evolving to have a different directive something akin to "protect Hannah", "obey Hannah", "become like a child for Hannah" and "protect itself" leading to its childish jealousy and what you could describe as the worst temper tantrum ever. This evolution of function in turn upgrades its capabilities which would explain why the Golem is able to make people explode which is backed up by the Golem of Prague having a similar ability. Now for question three does the Kabbalah make people go insane that is a difficult question to answer as we only have two case studies of people using Kabbalah in the film: Hannah and the Maharal of Prague who we only briefly see and from what little we do see it would be safe to assume that he was of right mind without delusion and he didn't seem to exhibit any of the stereotypical symptoms of insanity although from what I've read insanity is more or less a legal term rather than a psychological one so take that for what it's worth now Hannah is a different story Hannah is introduced into the movie as having been traumatized, unable to move on from her son's death and growing obsessed with finding an answer as to why he died and how he could be brought back this condition is a sign of complicated grief and pre-existing mental disturbances or disorders although as the movie goes on Hannah changes at first she's a bit manipulative, lying to Benjamin about her use of contraceptive and then this leads to her getting jealous and dangerously possessive of Benjamin as she finds out that her neighbor is flirting with her man which then leads to her sadistic glee after finding out that Golem murdered her neighbor for her which although incredibly disturbing Does it mean that Hannah's crazy? Yes, well sort, of it's complicated you see it's never established what happens when someone goes mad from Kabbalah so it's safe to assume that Hanna's actions and reactions are a consequence of Kabballic Madness especially her acceptance, love, and affection for the golem child although by the end of the film she gets over this delusion that the golem child can serve as a surrogate for Joseph, her dead son, and learns to move on from there so it's a little bit ambiguous as to whether or not Kabbalic madness is a case-by-case thing or if it's even real at all although you take it to consideration the fact that magic Kabbalah especially in the film is real and that both diegetically, in the film, and nondiegetically, in real life, traditional kabbalah requires specific people to study it. Requirements such as being of the age of 40 and being male for example. it makes a lot of sense that the Kabbalic Madness is in fact a real thing that the kebab madness is in fact a real thing but it only affects specific people but what do you guys think do you think Hannah's golem assumed a more human form due to their bond? Do you think Kabbalah drives people insane let me know, whether you agree or disagree with me, with a comment down below and with that being said thank you so much for watching ladies and gentlemen if you enjoyed it leave a like down below and subscribe to get updated automatically and until next time.
