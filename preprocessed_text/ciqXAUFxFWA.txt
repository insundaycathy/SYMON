Hi guys, K-Movie Recapped here. Before we start, WARNING! Spoilers Ahead! Today, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to explain a 2021 Thailand Horror-Mystery movie called Ghost Lab. This movie tells the story of two best friends who are trying to scientifically prove the existence of ghosts. But once they crossed the line, they regret their decision. Watch the movie until the end to see their shocking experiment result. The story starts with 2 residency doctors, who are long-time best friends, discussing a recent patient case with 2 other nurses. The patient is badly burnt all over his body and his head is nearly split in half. That patient died on the bed, wailing and writhing in pain. Dr. Gla loves ghost stories and thinks that case is interesting. But his best friend, Dr. Wee, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe in ghosts because it can\xe2\x80\x99t be explained scientifically. Dr. Wee\xe2\x80\x99s mother has been admitted to the same hospital he works in for the last 8 years. He becomes a doctor because of it. He always takes care of his mother after work, which makes him doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have any social life. Dr. Gla is his only bestfriend. On the night, when they are on a night shift, they discuss more about the possibility of the existence of ghosts. Suddenly, they see something unexpected. It\xe2\x80\x99s an unknown dark figure, like a person, but with a burnt body. They realized that it is the ghost of the patient they talked about earlier. Feeling curious, Dr. Gla moves toward it while Dr. Wee records it on his phone. But suddenly, that figure is gone. The video Dr. Wee recorded doesn\xe2\x80\x99t show anything, the hospital CCTV also doesn't show that unknown figure. On the next day, they talk about that bizarre event. Dr. Wee still doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe it despite after he saw it with his own eyes. It can\xe2\x80\x99t be explained scientifically. So Dr. Gla suggests doing their own investigation. He asks Dr. Wee to follow him to a room at the old building of the hospital. Inside, there are already some investigation results that Dr. Gla did. It turns out that Dr. Gla has been doing an investigation on ghosts. He has done various experiments at various locations around the world to prove the existence of ghosts. He told Dr. Wee that his first encounter with a ghost was when he was still a child. Not long after his father died, he saw an unknown figure that looked like his father. But after that, he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t seen any other ghost, until last night. He has a dream to publish a scientific journal about the existence of ghosts. Dr. Wee looks interested in ghosts now and decided to do the experiment together. After discussing for a while, they concluded that since the camera can not capture the image of ghosts, they need to make the other see the ghost as well. But to do that, they need to find a method to control the appearance of ghosts. After a week of trying to contact the same ghost, they haven\xe2\x80\x99t succeeded yet. They try to do an experiment on the old building of the hospital and get evidence about poltergeist ghosts, but the ghost doesn\xe2\x80\x99t show itself so it can\xe2\x80\x99t be used as evidence. They then decide that they need to make some kind of relationship with the ghost to make them appear in front of them. Dr. Gla suggests making a relationship with terminally ill patients, hoping that after they die, they will show themselves to them. But Dr. Wee opposes the idea, telling him that manipulating patients just for the sake of the experiment is wrong. While debating, Dr. Wee suddenly gets a message that his mother is in critical condition. Her doctor was able to resurrect her but now she is brain dead. Dr. Wee decides to let his mother go and turns off her life support. After her mother has passed away, he and Dr. Gla spend the night in his mother's room, hoping that she will contact them. In the middle of the night, his mother appears, trying to tell him something. He couldn't hear what she was trying to say but not long after that, she disappeared. Frustrated by the death of his mother and the fact that their experiment is hitting a wall, Dr. Wee suggests a crazy idea. He offers to kill himself so that he can turn into a ghost. Any other ghost doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have the will to do the experiment, but if the ghost is him they can do the experiment as much as they like. Dr. Gla thinks that since he started the experiment, if someone needs to die, it\xe2\x80\x99s him. They agreed to flip a coin to see who will have to die. It turns out to be Dr.Wee. They then prepared to execute the crazy idea. Dr. Gla hugs him for the last time and goes outside the room. But in the end, Dr. Wee couldn\xe2\x80\x99t pull the trigger. He backs down at the last moment. Seeing that, Dr. Gla goes inside and tells him not to worry. He then grabs the gun and shoots his own head. Some times have passed, but Dr. Wee has not been contacted yet by the ghost of Dr. Gla. People start wondering why he killed himself. His mother and his girlfriend are devastated. Dr. Wee is frustrated and feels responsible for the death of his friend. He decided to kill himself by jumping from the top of the building. But just after he jumps, something is pulling him back to safety. It\xe2\x80\x99s the ghost of Dr. Gla. He feels relieved by it. It\xe2\x80\x99s the first contact between him and the ghost of Dr. Gla. Dr. Wee tries to contact him again, but he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t respond. He then tries to do something crazy again. He tries to cut his finger, but Dr. Gla comes to save him. He still can\xe2\x80\x99t see him, but they can communicate by using the laptop now. Dr. Gla told him that he can\xe2\x80\x99t see another ghost and his visibility is limited. He only can see and interact when he is emotionally affected. Not long after that, Dr. Gla disappears again. Dr. Wee then goes to Dr. Gla\xe2\x80\x99s mother. When they talk about the death of Dr. Gla, his mother and sister become sad. This makes Dr. Gla emotionally affected and can interact with them. Dr. Gla tells Dr. Wee that this is too painful for him and disappears. Later, Dr. Wee tries to force him to show up by cutting his finger again. But this time, Dr. Gla doesn\xe2\x80\x99t show up and his finger is amputated. Mia starts looking for the reason behind Dr. Gla\xe2\x80\x99s suicide. She takes the laptop from Dr. Wee. After realizing that the laptop is missing, he goes to Mia\xe2\x80\x99s apartment. There, Dr. Gla interacts with him again and tells him to tell Mia about everything. But Dr. Wee refuses, making Dr. Gla angry. The lift suddenly stops and falls down. It almost kills him. On the next day, Dr. Wee invites Mia to their experiment room. He told her that he will tell her everything. But when she gets there, he drugs her and tries to sexually assault her. He tries to provoke Dr. Gla further so that he can appear in front of him. As expected, Dr. Gla comes and throws Dr. Wee across the room. Dr. Gla keeps attacking him and throws him from the second floor. Even though his leg is broken. He still tries to record this evidence on his phone. But Dr. Gla grabs his broken leg and twists it, making him unconscious. When he wakes up, he realizes that he is in the morgue. He lies beside Dr. Gla\xe2\x80\x99s body. It suddenly moves and strangles him until he dies. In the underworld, he meets Dr. Gla. He tells him to stop the experiment. They have crossed the line too far. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want Dr. Wee to do more crazy things just for the experiment. Dr. Gla is already proud of what he has done so far and tells him to live his life for him. He agrees to stop the experiment. He then suddenly comes back to life. At the end of the story, he tells Mia about the truth and apologizes for what he did to her that night. She accepts it and says that she is happy because when she was asleep that night she met Dr. Gla in her dream. He looks happy and is holding a magazine with his and Dr. Wee\xe2\x80\x99s face on the cover. He then decides to delete all of the experiment data and lives his life just like Dr. Gla told him at the underworld.
