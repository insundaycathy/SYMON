and runs away. she bursts into her bedroom and starts backing. laurie stands up and goes to give her the cupcake. when tree has an epiphany, she realizes that she woke up the same day because she died in her sleep. tree thinks lori killed her by poisoning the cupcake. but when tree kept not eating the cupcake, laurie used the serial killer as an opportunity to kill her and get away with it. it was always lori that killed her. tree tells her to eat the cupcake and prove that it wasn't her, or she'll take it to the police. laurie knocks her down and locks the room. she tells her the reason for wanting to kill her was the professor, because she was in love with him. they start fighting around the room, and lori almost kills her when she gets distracted long enough for tree to shove the cupcake in her mouth and then push her out of the window falling in front of the girl facing the sorority house. tree and carter are watching the news in the diner. her dad calls and she picks up to
