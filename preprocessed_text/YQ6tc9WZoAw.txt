Hi, Mystery Recapped here. Today, I am going to explain the fifth and sixth episodes of the South Korean survival drama \xe2\x80\x9cSquid Game\xe2\x80\x9d, called \xe2\x80\x9cA, fair world\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cGganbu\xe2\x80\x9d. Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care!. In the previous episode, Gi-hun\xe2\x80\x99s team was about to lose the game of tug of war, so Sangwoo thought of a last-minute plan. He asked everyone to loosen their grip on the rope for a few seconds so their opponents would fall down. As they do, Gi-hun, who was at the front, almost falls off the bridge. But the plan works, and their opponents trip and fall, losing their hold on the rope. The team uses this opportunity to pull the rope harder than ever, and finally wins the game. They lie on the ground in exhaustion, feeling the adrenaline rush in their bodies. While returning back to their room, the girl who Saebyeok had recruited, Jiyeong, makes fun of a team member who happens to be a priest. They return to the room to see Deoksu\xe2\x80\x99s team talking to each other. Minyeo stares at the man, subtly telling him she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need him anymore. The group then sits together while talking. Minyeo tries to charm everyone so they would favor her. She also belittles Ali for being a foreigner and asks for his passport. As they talk, it is announced that the lights will be off in some minutes. They know people might start killing at night, so the group plans to make a barricade and stay awake in pairs to keep watch. As they try to build a safe zone using the bunk beds, Deoksu approaches Gi-hun and makes fun of him for thinking the beds can stop them from being killed. Gi-hun, on the other hand, warns him of his own team members. He thinks since Deoksu has been ordering them around, he might be their first target. His words get into Deoksu\xe2\x80\x99s head, so he tells his team that they won\xe2\x80\x99t be killing tonight. Ilnam offers to be the first one to keep watch, saying that old people do not need to sleep. But the kind man is told to shut up by a new member, because they cannot keep an old man as a guard. Soon the lights go out, and Sangwoo and Ali stay awake to guard the others. Ali thanks Sangwoo for saving his life today and hands him a corn that he had saved for him. Sangwoo breaks it in half, and the two enjoy the corn while talking. He asks Ali to call him \xe2\x80\x9cHyung\xe2\x80\x9d, which means big brother in Korean. They share stories about how they ended up in the game. After a while, Sangwoo wakes Gi-hun to swap the duties. Deoksu also can\xe2\x80\x99t seem to fall asleep with the fear of being killed. He realises that the doctor who had gone to the washroom isn\xe2\x80\x99t back yet. Meanwhile, the police officer Junho is taken to the room where some staff secretly harvest the dead player\xe2\x80\x99s organs. He finds out that the man he killed on the ship was also involved in the secret program. The doctor is also there, performing the procedures. He gets into an argument with the staff for being slow. Back in the room, Ilnam joins Gi-hun to keep watch. Gi-hun tells him how he was not paid for ten years worth of work because the car company he worked at was at a loss. Ilnam sympathizes with him and starts crying all of a sudden. Gi-hun tries to calm him and realises that the old man has a fever. He makes him lay down, but doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have water to help reduce his fever. Saebyeok offers him some, and the two put Inam to sleep. It is now their turn to keep watch. Meanwhile, the doctor gets done harvesting the organs and hands them to Junho and another staff who are supposed to dive underwater and give them to the buyers in the sea. After they leave, he asks the others about tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s game. But it turns out even they do not know what it will be. The doctor freaks out, saying that he will be killed if they do not tell him. He holds one of them hostage and asks the other staff to figure out about the game quickly. They get into a fight, leading the doctor to run out to the hallways. But he gets lost in the maze and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know how to return. A staff member follows him to the playground where the game honeycomb was played. He asks the doctor to calm down, because if they are caught, all of them will be killed. The doctor asks him to show his face so that he can trust him. The two are talking, when suddenly, the overseer of the facility shoots the staff. He then says that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care what the staff does with the dead bodies, but they aren\xe2\x80\x99t allowed to tell the players about the games. That ruins the main essence of the facility, that is equality. He then kills the man, while the other staff shoots the doctor dead. At the same time, Junho and a staff member go down through an emergency exit, which the man claims are for the VIPs. Junho vaguely asks him about the VIPs, but the man reveals no one knows who they are. He becomes suspicious of Junho for inquiring so much, and asks him to open his mask. The man finds out Junho is a different person, but before he can react, Junho points his gun at him. He inquires about his brother, but the man doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know anything about him. But he tells him about the players\xe2\x80\x99 information file in their overseer\xe2\x80\x99s room, where he can find his brother\xe2\x80\x99s information. A secret stairway that leads him to the overseer\xe2\x80\x99s room lies nearby. Junho shoots the man dead and enters the overseer\xe2\x80\x99s room. After he is gone, the overseer and the staff come downstairs to see the man who was killed by Junho. The overseer takes the bullet out of his body and realises it belongs to a policeman. The staff are ordered to find the man as soon as possible. An alarm starts blaring, waking the players up. They are quickly made to line up in the middle by the staff. Ilnam refuses to get up, because it turns out he had peed himself at night. Meanwhile, Junho is in the overseer\xe2\x80\x99s room, where he finds the files of every single person who has ever participated in the game. He figures that the games have been played for many years now. The players are then made to stand in lines in the middle of the room. Gi-hun helps Ilnam by tying his jacket around the old man\xe2\x80\x99s waist, so he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be embarrassed. After that, the players are then taken outside through the halls, where everyone is horrified to see the dead bodies of the doctor and the staff who helped him being hung to the ceiling. An announcement is made saying that this will happen to anyone who breaks the rules for his own benefit. In the meantime, Junho is still in the overseer\xe2\x80\x99s office, taking pictures of the documents he thinks are important. He is searching for his brother\xe2\x80\x99s file when he hears a phone ringing outside. The overseer comes into the room and picks it up. He talks to a foreign man in English about a minor disturbance that happened between the staff, and assures the person on the other end everything will be good when the VIPs arrive. After the overseer leaves, Junho picks up the phone and tries to call the number, but to no avail. In the meantime, the players are taken to an empty white room, where they will have to separate in a group of two each. Gi-hun\xe2\x80\x99s team needs to separate as well; they look at each other in confusion, knowing that they will have to go against each other now. Minyeo tries to sweet-talk Gi-hun to team up with her. When he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t speak, she makes her way to Sangwoo, who also declines her offer. Sangwoo asks Ali to be his teammate, and the two look at Gi-hun to see if he objects. Gi-hun asks them to go ahead and starts looking for a teammate himself. Ilnam makes his way towards him, but Gi-hun knows he cannot win with an old man as his partner, so he apologises to him. Ilnam simply gives him his jacket, saying that the others might look down upon him if he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have one. Gi-hun feels bad for the man, but goes looking for a member anyway. Saebyeok and Jiyeong join hands as well. A man asks Gi-hun to be his teammate. He reveals that since the doctor is dead, it leaves an odd number of players. So, the one with no partner will probably be killed. Gi-hun looks at Ilnam sitting alone in a corner and feels awful for abandoning him, so he asks the old man to be his partner. In the end, the one person who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a partner is Minyeo. She makes a fuss about them not being able to win without her. As the players make their way to play the game, she is taken away by the guards. The players are then brought to a mock neighbourhood with several houses and streets. Ilnam and Gi-hun talk about the allyways looking like their childhood homes, while Ali and Sangwoo promise each other that they will win the money together for their families. However, all their plans fail when it is announced that the pairs will be going against each other. They are given ten marbles each and are told to play any game they want to with them. Most of them choose either a game where you should throw the marbles into a pit, or a game in which one guesses how many marbles the other person has. They are given thirty minutes to complete the game. Gi-hun is shocked, but Ilnam seems to be looking at the marbles in fascination. He has completely forgotten what he was here for. As the game starts, everyone starts playing, but Ilnam goes around the blocks, looking for his house. Gi-hun tries to stop him, but he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to play the game, saying it to be childish. At last, Gi-hun slams the old man to the wall in frustration, knowing that both of them will die if they do not play. Ilnam trembles in fear and accepts to play with him. At the same time, Ali and Sangwoo, who treat each other like brothers, have to go against each other now. Ali doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to play the game, but Sangwoo insists they do, or else both of them will lose. Ali doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even know how to play it, so Sangwoo teaches him. One of them will have to keep a certain number of marbles hidden in a fist. The other one will guess if the number of marbles in their fist is odd or even. If the guess is right, all the marbles the person is holding will go to the person who made the correct guess. The two start playing, and Ali makes the right guess at first, taking two of Sangwoo\xe2\x80\x99s marbles. Eventually, Ali wins all of Sangwoo\xe2\x80\x99s marbles, except one. When people start dying, Sangwoo claims that he has a way they both can win. An innocent Ali who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to be the reason Sangwoo dies, listens to his plan. Sangwoo claims that at the end of the game, people are not going to agree on a winner because they will nitpick the rules. The staff will then have only one way to continue, that is to make one team go against another. So, they make a deal to go around the playing zone looking for the players who are older, so they can go against them at the end. Ali still doesn\xe2\x80\x99t understand Sangwoo's plan, but agree to do whatever he wants because he trusts him. Sangwoo also makes him wear his marble bag on his neck so no one can snatch it. Meanwhile, Jiyeong and Saebyeok sit together, not knowing what to do. Saebyeok, being from North Korea, doesn't know any marble games, so Ji Yeong offers to teach her. But both girls do not want to play for thirty minutes, so they decide to just talk for the most of the time and bet all of their marbles on one game at the end. Saebyeok, who normally doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like to speak much, reveals that her father died while trying to cross the border, and her mother was caught by the Chinese police and sent back to North Korea. She wants to buy a house and bring her mother back after she wins the money. Jiyeong laughs, saying that she could do a lot more than that with the money. Saebyeok innocently claims she wants to visit Jeju island, to which Jiyeong offers to go together. They realise that it cannot happen because one of them will die today. Jiyeong then reveals that she killed her abusive father and went to prison. She has no motive to live for even if she wins the money. In the meantime, Ilnam and Gi-hun start the game, and Ilnam wins five of Gi-hun\xe2\x80\x99s marbles in just the first round. As they go on, Gi-hun is left with only one marble. He nervously guesses odd for the number of marbles inside Ilnam\xe2\x80\x99s fist, only for it to be even. Gi-hun loses the game; however, Ilnam forgets what Gi-hun had predicted, allowing him to change his answer. Starting that round, Gi-hun uses Ilnam\xe2\x80\x99s dementia to win every round. At last, Ilnam only has one marble left, but he starts looking for his house again instead of playing. Similarly, Deoksu also wins the game against one of his minions when his marble accidentally falls into the pit. Now only three minutes of the game are left. Jiyeong and Saebyeok decide to throw one marble to the wall, the one who throws the closest will win. Saebyeok goes first and does pretty well. But when it is Jiyeong\xe2\x80\x99s turn, she drops the marble on the ground lazily, making Saebyeok win. Saebyeok corners her and asks her to go again, because it isn\xe2\x80\x99t fair. However, Jiyeong claims she has nothing to live for, unlike her. They say their last goodbyes before a staff member shoots Jiyeong dead. Ali, on the other hand, goes looking for Sangwoo because only a few minutes of the game are left. But when he checks his bag of marbles, he realises that his brother-like friend has betrayed him. Sangwoo had exchanged Ali\xe2\x80\x99s marbles with pebbles. Ali sheds the last tear, still in disbelief, before a guard shoots him dead. Now, only Ilnam and Gi-hun are left. They have to play one last game for Gi-hun to win. But Ilnam suggests they bet all their marbles for the last game. Gi-hun is enraged, claiming that it isn\xe2\x80\x99t fair. To Gi-hun\xe2\x80\x99s surprise, Ilam reveals that he knows Gi-hun has been cheating on him. The old man had faked having dementia to make Gi-hun win. At last, Ilnam happily hands his last marble to Gi-hun and thanks him for playing with him. Gi-hun hugs his friend for the last time and walks out of the house sobbing. The episode ends as a gunshot startles him, indicating that Ilnam has been killed. Subscribe for more videos like this, turn on notifications, and leave a like to help the channel out.
