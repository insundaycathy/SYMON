Hello Guys, Welcome back to the channel, where we recap movies for you. Today, we will be recapping the movie called \xe2\x80\x9cKnock Knock\xe2\x80\x9d, which has Keanu Reeves in it. Please turn the subtitles on, if you have trouble understanding me. So, let's get started, and spoilers ahead. At the start of the movie, we see that Evan and his wife Karen are getting a little intimate early in the morning. But, they are soon disturbed by their two kids, who have brought a cake for father\xe2\x80\x99s day. They have even brought him a gift. Evan opens it to find a clock made by the two kids. Evan acts very excited in front of his children, and thanks both of them. Evan cuts the cake, but his children push the cake to his face and run away. Evan chases after them making a monster noise. They seem like a very happy family. The family sits to have lunch and celebrate Father\xe2\x80\x99s Day. Then, we see Louis, the assistant of Karen. Karen is an artist, and she has lots of her artwork at her house. In a few days, her art was scheduled to be showcased at an art gallery. And Louis was in charge of moving her art to the art gallery on time. After their lunch, the family plans a beach trip, but Evan doesn\xe2\x80\x99t join them. He has a lot of work left from his office, and he also has a shoulder injury which will keep him from having fun with his family. So, Karen and the kids leave without Evan. That night, Evan is working alone at his house. Evan is an architect and has been working on a project for a few months. He receives a call from his wife, and she informs that they have reached the beach house. Karen says that she misses him on this trip, and then they hang up the phone. Evan works for a few hours, and then he hears the doorbell ring. He goes to check, and finds two attractive girls, and they\xe2\x80\x99re both soaked wet with the rain. The two girls introduce themselves as Bel, and Genesis. They tell Evan that they were going to a party, but they had lost their way. And with the rain, they\xe2\x80\x99re phones were also not working properly. Trying to be a good person, Evan welcomes them inside to shelter them from the heavy rain. Evan hands them towels to clean themselves and also gives them his i-pad to contact their friends. While Genesis is trying to contact their friends, Bel thanks Evan for letting them inside. She tells him that not everyone would have helped them. Then, Genesis tells Bel that the party address is pretty far from where they were. So, Evan proposes that he will call a cab for them. Evan books a cab, but it will take it 45 minutes to arrive at his house. 45 minutes is a long wait, so the girls ask Evan if they can use his dryer to dry their clothes. Evan prepares them coffee and takes their clothes to the dryer. After that, they all sit to have a conversation. Bel and Genesis ask Evan about his wife. Evan answers that his wife and children were out for a beach trip. Hearing that he was all alone by himself on father\xe2\x80\x99s day, they both get up and hug him. Evan thinks nothing of it, but when Genesis touches his arm, he feels uncomfortable and goes to another chair. After that, the two girls all of a sudden start talking about their sex life. Evan gets confused to see how open they both were. They start asking Evan about his wife. Evan tells them that his wife is an artist, and proudly shows them the art catalog of his wife. Bel and Genesis get close to Evan and say that his wife is a very lucky woman. Evan gets uncomfortable and sits away from them. He checks his phone and the cab is 20 minutes away. Genesis asks Evan if he has been with any other woman after marriage. Evan answers \xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x9d. And Bel tells Evan that when she gets married, she will let her husband sleep with other women. That way she believes her husband will never cheat on her. Evan is surprised to hear this and nervously laughs. All of a sudden, they both get close to him and start seducing him. Evan again gets up to get away from them. He checks his phone and the cab is just 5 minutes away. Genesis asks if she can use the bathroom and Evan shows her the way. Evan gets up to play music, and Bel starts to dance seductively. She pulls Evan towards her and starts dancing with him. Evan doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do, and they almost kiss. But, the phone rings, and Evan informs her that the cab was here. Evan takes their clothes out of the dryer and sees that the cab was waiting for them. He takes the clothes to them, and calls them from outside the bathroom. After not getting any response, Evan goes inside to find both of them without clothes. They both start seducing Evan, who keeps telling them that he is a married man and cannot do this. But, the girls aren\xe2\x80\x99t listening to him and start touching him. Evan tries to control himself, but he cannot stop what was happening to him, and gives in to his pleasure. After waiting for a long time, the cab driver also leaves from there. That night, Evan sleeps with both of them. Next morning, Evan gets up and finds himself alone. The clothes from the bathroom are also gone So, he thinks that the girls were out of his house. But to his surprise, he finds them in the kitchen, making a total mess out of the place. Evan gets angry, and wants them to leave. But the girls just laugh and don\xe2\x80\x99t listen to him. Just then, Evan receives a call from his wife, he goes outside to receive the call. He tries to speak as if nothing weird is going on in the house, but the girls start making weird noises from inside. Evan starts to get distracted and quickly ends the conversation. He loses his temper and tells the girls to get out of his house right now. He pushes them to get their clothes and leave his house. Evan goes to check and finds Genesis in her clothes. But Bel isn\xe2\x80\x99t there. So, he goes to search for Bel and finds her in his closet. Bel tries to seduce him again, and tells him that she wants him before she leaves. But this time, Evan is in his senses. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t lose control and tells them to get out in three minutes. After a while, Evan goes to check on them, but finds them totally destroying the artworks of his wife. Evan gets furious and tells them that if they don\xe2\x80\x99t leave his house, he will call the cops. Hearing his threat, Bel and genesis start to laugh. They tell Evan that they are both underage girls, and if Evan calls the police, it will be him that will go to jail. Evan is shocked to hear this, and realizes that he has made a huge mistake. Everything that they said yesterday was a lie, they were just messing around with him. Evan tries to give them money to leave him alone, but they get angry at him and tell him that they\xe2\x80\x99re not prostitutes. Just then someone calls Evan from his door. He goes to check and finds Karen\xe2\x80\x99s friend. She was there to ask if he needed help with anything since he was alone by himself. Evan gets nervous to see her. He tries to get her out of there, but Genesis comes outside and starts acting like his girlfriend. Karen\xe2\x80\x99s friend is disgusted to look at Evan and leaves immediately. Evan has had enough. He goes inside and tries to force them to leave his house. But, the girls keep on making fun of him. Evan finally says that he will call the police, no matter what. Fearing that he might call the police for real, they agree to leave. Evan takes them in his car and leaves them to their destination. Evan goes back to his house, and starts cleaning the mess that Bel and Genesis had made. At night, he sits to work on his project, but he hears something drop. He sees that a photo frame had dropped. He bends down to pick it up, but Genesis hits him from behind and knocks him out. When Evan wakes up, he finds himself tied up to his bed. He tells Genesis to free him, but she isn\xe2\x80\x99t listening to him at all. Then, Bel comes inside and Evan sees her wearing the school uniform of his daughter. She even starts calling him \xe2\x80\x9cDaddy\xe2\x80\x9d. Bel and Genesis both start taking Evan\xe2\x80\x99s clothes off. Evan tries to resist with all his strength. But, just then, he receives a call from his wife. Fearing that they will answer the call and show her wife everything, Evan agrees to do whatever they say. Bel starts having sex with Evan, while Genesis starts to record everything with her phone. When Genesis goes outside to grab something to eat, Evan uses all his strength to free himself and gets Bel off of him. He unties himself and goes outside to attack Genesis. But she manages to stab him with a fork. Evan cries out loud with pain, and soon faints to sleep. When he wakes up, he again finds himself tied up to a chair, with a cloth in his mouth. Bel and Genesis start to play a game with Evan. Whenever Evan doesn\xe2\x80\x99t answer their question, they play loud screeching sounds in his ears. Louis gets to his house, to get Karen\xe2\x80\x99s artworks and ship it for the art gallery. Bel takes Evan to another room. And Genesis answers the door. Louis is confused to find them at Evan\xe2\x80\x99s house, but they tell him that they are nieces of Evan. Louis goes to check the artwork and finds them destroyed. Bel and Genesis tell him that it was maybe Evan who made the mess out of the artwork. Louis is furious and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe them one bit. He tells them that he will call the cops. Genesis tries to seduce him, but he isn\xe2\x80\x99t easily seduced like Evan. He shouts at the girls, and hears a noise. He follows the sound and finds Evan tied up. He quickly tries to untie Evan, but he hears that the girls are destroying the art piece. Seeing the art piece get demolished by Bel and Genesis, Louis gets an asthma attack. He tries to use his inhaler, but the crazy girls take it away from him and start playing catch with it. Louis begs them to give him his inhaler, but they don\xe2\x80\x99t listen. While trying to take his inhaler, Louis slips and hits his head on the solid concrete. Louis is dead after this, but Bel and Genesis aren\xe2\x80\x99t worried at all. In fact, they start laughing maniacally. Evan asks them to call the ambulance, but they say it's too late. They start to cover Louis\xe2\x80\x99s body and also exchange texts from the phone of Evan and Louis. They are trying to stage a fight between Evan and Louis, to make it seem like it was Evan who killed him. They put Louis\xe2\x80\x99 body in the van and go back to Evan. Evan asks them the reason behind what they had done. They answer that they were checking if Evan would cheat on his wife or not. They were total psychopaths. They believe that since Evan cheated on his wife, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t deserve to stay alive. Hearing that they are going to kill him, Evan starts screaming at them. He tells them that it was them, who came after him. But Bel and Genesis don\xe2\x80\x99t budge. They say that Evan will be executed at dawn. They both start digging a hole, possibly to bury Evan. While they are getting busy with the digging, Evan uses his legs to get to his i-pad. He uses automated voice assistance to call Karen. The i-pad calls Karen, but Bel and Genesis are back. Genesis finds the i-pad and throws it outside. Bel and Genesis then start acting like monsters, just like how Evan used to with his children. Evan gets confused and asks them how they knew about it. But they keep on mocking him. Then, Evan knows that they were spying on him and his family for a long time. Bel and Genesis get changed, and start destroying everything. They destroy all the artworks of Karen. They destroy Evan\xe2\x80\x99s house and even cut his hair. They\xe2\x80\x99re making a complete mockery out of Evan. While destroying the house, they find a gun that Evan had hidden in case of emergencies. After finding the gun, Genesis says that she wants to play hide and seek. They untie him and tell him that he has 30 seconds to hide. If Evan gets out of the house, they will shoot him. But if Evan manages to hide until morning, Bel and Genesis promise to leave him. After this, Evan goes somewhere in his house to hide. Bel and Genesis start looking for him. They look everywhere but fail to find him. Evan tries to escape from them, but Genesis catches him. Evan cries out for help but Genesis tells him that no one was there to help him. The sun finally rises, They take the tied up body of Evan to the hole they had dug last night. They put him inside the hole and start covering it. Soon, they have the entire hole covered with only Evan\xe2\x80\x99s head sticking out. Genesis grabs a stone and it seems she will use it to kill Evan. But, she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t smash it on Evan\xe2\x80\x99s head. Bel and Genesis both start laughing loudly. Evan, for the final time, begs them to leave him alone. Then, Bel and Genesis reveal the truth. They tell him that they were just having fun with him, and weren\xe2\x80\x99t planning to kill him at all. In fact, they were not even underage girls. They just wanted to seduce a married man, and then ruin his family. It was something that they really enjoyed. After telling Evan the truth, Bel shows Evan a video. It\xe2\x80\x99s the video that Genesis had taken, when Bel was wearing Evan\xe2\x80\x99s daughter\xe2\x80\x99s school uniform, and she was in bed with Evan. She even uploads the video on Evan\xe2\x80\x99s facebook page, and writes a caption on it, \xe2\x80\x9cHappy Father\xe2\x80\x99s Day\xe2\x80\x9d. Bel and Genesis were truly sick human beings. They leave the phone in front of Evan, and leave to look out for a new victim. Evan\xe2\x80\x99s family also return from their trip and find their house completely ruined. At the same time, Evan manages to take his hands out. He tries to delete the video from his facebook account, but he accidentally ends up liking it. And the movie ends. Hope you guys enjoyed the video. If you ever find yourself in a situation like Evan, please try to control yourself, or you might get yourself in the same condition as Evan.
