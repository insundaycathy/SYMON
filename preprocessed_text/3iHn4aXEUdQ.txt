Singing in the Rain is a musical masterpiece filled with memorable songs spectacular dance routines, a classic old Hollywood setting: it's a film that many would describe as a timeless classic and I believe you should watch it as for why that is let's look at two aspects of the film the story and the spectacle of the song and dance routines and with that out of the way This is Singing in the Rain the movie is set in the 1910s, at the premiere of a Don Lockwood and Lina Lamont film both of whom are big-name movie stars though it's Don that's the star of this film before the premiere, we learn about Don's humble beginnings from his childhood growing up and working with his best friend, Cosmo Brown, up until his adulthood where he began to rise in fame going from musician, to Vaudeville act, to stuntman until he became the leading man that he is today. After the premiere Don and Cosmo head out to attend a party hosted by RF Simpson, the producer of Don's films, but on their way there they have car trouble and run into a frenzy of Don's fans who Don manages to escape from after jumping into the car of Kathy Selden a young and aspiring actress hoping to make it big on stage who freaks out when she sees dawn but when she realizes who he is she makes it clear what she thinks about Don's work its overly dramatic, its lacking in life, and what more it\'s not even "real acting" which doesn't sit well with Don but even with this disagreement she drops him off at R.F.'s party and it's here Don is shown a talking movie \xe2\x80\x93a technical marvel for the time that many guests are skeptical of after the showing a cake is wheeled out and from it pops out Kathy Selden! Who is not in fact an actress but is in fact a chorus girl after her performance and some teasing from Don about her high and mighty attitude earlier, Kathy throws a cake in Don's face but accidentally hits Lina instead! Kathy immediately leaves the party with Don in pursuit who has found himself smitten with the young dancer and wants to get to know her better but he doesn't catch up to her in time Three weeks later, Don meets Kathy at the back lot of Monumental Pictures where she admits that she's actually a big fan of his and is promptly hired to work with him and from here on out they'll be working very closely together but problems arise when the jazz singer, a talking movie or "talkie", becomes a big hit at the box office so Don and Lina's newest picture the Dueling Cavalier is turned into a talkie but problems arise on set due to the inexperience Don and Lina have with talking films and well, Lina's voice [Speaking in a shrill voice] "Pierre, you shouldn\'t have come!" and things go from bad to worse as on the night of the film's preview more problems occur: the audio dubbing goes out of sync and the performances are seen as cheesy and undignified leading to the first talkie of Don and Lina's career, bombing before it's even released after the embarrassing preview: Don, Cosmo, and Cathy mull over the failure of the film but the trio lift their spirits up after some talking as they come up with a plan to re-release the Dueling Cavalier as a musical with Kathy dubbing over Lina's physical performance fixing the problem of Lina's voice and of course taking advantage of the latest trends from there the trio work together to transform a Dueling Cavalier into a musical called "The Dancing Cavalier" secretly recording lines and songs without Lina's knowledge going so far as to shoot new scenes and changing the plot to feature a modern-day segment but Lina finds out and not only is she mad that Kathy will be dubbing over her performance she's jealous of the attention Don gives her (Kathy) and being the jealous diva that she is Lina blackmails and threatens to sue R.F. for this violation of her contract and with little choice R.F. begrudgingly agrees and wipes Kathy's credit from the film at the premiere of "The Dancing Cavalier" people love Lina and Don's performance and after much applause and encore from the audience, Don and Lina go backstage to be congratulated by Kathy and Cosmo where Lina reveals that Kathy is now contractually obligated to dub over Lina's performances for all future films and then an argument erupts backstage between Lina, The Trio, and R.F. but it's interrupted when Lina is asked to deliver a speech after which she's requested to sing live in front of all of these people but Don has a clever plan which he shares with R.F. and Cosmo and when Lina comes back for help dawn forces Kathy to sing into a microphone behind a curtain as Lina mouths along to the song Kathy sings only for the curtain to get pulled by Don, Cosmo, and R.F. humiliating Lina as the crowd realizes that it's Kathy doing the singing embarrassed and stressed from the whole ordeal Kathy tries to run away but is stopped when Don gives credit where credit is due and admits his love for Kathy and the film and to the two of them kissing in front of the billboard for their newest film: Singing in the Rain so the story of Singing in the Rain is simple: It's cute, it's quaint, it's classic an appealing and romantic love story that charmed the critics and audiences who watched it that fills those who watch it with this warm, fuzzy feeling of nostalgia but story is only part of the reason why people remember Singing in the Rain the other part is its music and dances and to get what I mean let's look at three of my favorite song and dance routines: Make 'Em Laugh, Broadway Melody, and Singing in the Rain "Make \'Em Laugh" is such a fun and creative sequence: the set up for this is that Don is visiting the studio three weeks after the party talking with Cosmo who goes on a rant about actors and entertainers leading to this song. This whole sequence composed of multiple long takes makes good use of "mise-en-scene", with a dynamic floor routine that goes up and down, left and right intermixed with silly gags and funny moments such as Cosmo trying to fix his nose after running into a brick wall and the memorable and goofy couch sequence with Cosmo and a dummy\xe2\x80\x93it's a fun whimsical high-energy performance that I loved as a child and I still do even to this day "Broadway Melody" is one humdinger of a sequence and arguably one the most artistically impressive framed as a diegetic movie it has impressive sets and an internal storyline that features Cyd Charisse as a guest dancer who's got legs that go on for miles! Yowza! the sequence is set in a fantastical and stage-depiction of Broadway with colorful clothes, moving sidewalks, and Don playing a young dancer hoping to make it big on Big Broadway it is filled to the brim with bombastic big-band music, group dance numbers and solo floor routines and also features a two minute long dance shared by Gene Kelly and Cyd Charisse who throughout the dance exudes this intensely sultry seductive energy and although the sequence is a bit jarring with how its introduced the whole sequence is an ode to Broadway musicals and acts as a nice respite in art design and creativity from the rest of the film finally there is my favorite song and dance sequence that the musical was named after Singing in the Rain, featuring Don singing about how his hopes are high, he's in love, and how he feels like a million bucks! Nothing in this moment can bring him down not even the rain that he's singing and dancing in and it's just fun to see Don cut loose and enjoy himself as he plays around with the street set and his umbrella with the band swelling in parallel with the peaking of his joy and spirit and there are a lot of things I love about the sequence, in particular are the many memorable shots throughout it like Don hanging from the lamppost or leaning against it and this particular moment where he's got this big, goofy grin on his face that perfectly encapsulates the feelings I get when I watch this movie there's this joy, this vigor, and this emotion to the song, to the dance, and to the cinematography that I can't help but adore. Maybe it's the choreography, the expression of Don's face, or the big-band sound that plays throughout the whole sequence whatever it is, it always makes me grin and sing along with Don whenever I watch this sequence and it really is the crowning jewel of this musical and after talking about all these things the unifying feature that to me makes this film so memorable is nostalgia because we see how film changes in response to new technology, we see how they've changed the way that they shoot films and make movies and the film's attention to detail in regards to these aspects of filmmaking and the industry as a whole makes it a celebration of an older time, a tribute to an era that would form the foundations of modern film Making Singing in the Rain into a time capsule that lets you peek into the past in addition to being a classic musical with great songs, choreography, and characters and with that said if you like musicals, I suggest that you watch this film at least ONCE in your life and if you don't like it you can tell me all about it in the comments down below with that said thank you so much for watching ladies and gentlemen, if you enjoyed it leave a like down below and subscribe to get updated on my latest uploads until next time
