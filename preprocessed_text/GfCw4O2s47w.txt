got a guy here no identification won't give his name says he's your brother says his binoculars killed somebody that's my brother Jerry Horne now you can't tell me that the most important plotline in Twin Peaks wasn't resolved in the finale hey everyone Greg and Ryan here this is the final breakdown for Twin Peaks the return okay before we get started make sure to subscribe to the GameSpot universe channel we've still got more game of Thrones Rick and Morty and the finale of preacher coming up plus more Twin Peaks right off the bat we start with Kohl confessing to Albert that he kept something from him for 25 years before major Briggs disappeared he told Gordon and Cooper about his discovery of an entity it was an extreme negative force in the ancient times it was called gout day over time it's become Judy Cooper told Gordon that if he ever disappeared to do everything he could to find him tiny side note we find out that Ray was a paid informant for the FBI : receives a call from the FBI in Vegas and bushnell Mullins comes in to deliver Cooper's message sheriff Truman the number of completion and just like that but FBI is on their way to 20 Peaks yep I also like that we get the most agent Albert line I think of the whole season right at the end we found Douglas Jones as my watch stopped or is that one of the Marx Brothers also one thing I liked at the beginning of that scene before Cole gives his series recap was that he couldn't pull the trigger on Diane and that makes a whole lot more sense when we go further into these two parts also Cole delivers one of my favorite lines in the episode I said you've gone soft in your old age not where it counts buddy sockitumi socketed next up mr. C uses the final set of coordinates to try to find Judy the coordinates lead to the white lodge portal that's right next to Jackrabbits palace once inside mr. C is locked in a cage and we see major Briggs is head and we also see the fireman floating up in the air just like we saw in part a off to the side there was also an endless chamber of those lodge style electrical generators and this is the moment the fireman lays his trap on mr. C and Bob the theater screen reveals a location of Judy the Palmer House and the fireman makes a quick switch to send mr. C outside the sheriff's station instead what is this a surprise andy brings mr. C inside okay here's where everything goes to level 11 not too long after mr. C sits down with Frank Truman gets a call from the real agent Cooper and then this happens what was that Lucy figured out how cellphones work apparently and I love the fanservice they put in there and I wasn't shocked one bit that that was pretty much the end of the fanservice going forward right at that point I loved it too her trademark switchboard management that has been part of the entire series kind of saved Twin Peaks at the end of the day if it wasn't for her we don't know what would have happened no there was another with a glove that helped out too right so down in the lockup chad breaks out and he comes in and freddy intervenes with his glove takes out chad q chad james night Oh Freddy and his green glove companion are brought upstairs as hot comes running in the room goes dark and the woodsman's start working on reviving mr. C in the same fashion of part 8 agent Cooper arrives and sees the woodsman working on Bob the Bob orb exits mr. C's body and Freddy finally figures out his destiny Freddy punches the over a few times with one last punch sending it through the floor as if he's sending Bob straight to hell the Bob orb comes out again attacks ready one more time Freddy punches it one last time and it shatters the pieces float up and pass through the ceiling now is this the end of Bob I have no clue but I would love to know how Frost and Lynch came up with the Freddy Sykes character out of nowhere they could have this be any character in Twin Peaks but they said nope let's make it a new character and he's gonna show up final episodes he's gonna show up the final parts it's crazy it could have been James even yeah like working at the same place they're gonna be so many recaps and people asking questions to David Lynch and Frost I just want to know that one question of what was the idea behind Freddy Sykes I love it I think that's a good number one I was still a little bummed to see mr. Cooper go out like that it's very dick Halloran and Stanley Kubrick's The Shining he goes all this way this whole journey just to get shot in the back of the head over 18 parts I grew to appreciate him unlike Leland Palmer mr. Cooper had can trol above in fact it's possible that all Bob was doing for him was making him invincible I think mr. C may have been going to Twin Peaks to free himself of Judy's influence remember when he goes into the lodge we see the Palmers home on the screen before the fireman swipes right over to the sheriff's department I had some investment in the idea that good Dale and bad deal would team up to defeat Judy but it also makes sense that the lodge / FBI wouldn't care about mr. Cooper's interests he was a free agent looking out for himself living the American dream how's mr. C gonna go out oh he's gonna get shot by Lucy and then a man with the green gloves got punched Bob out of existence right that makes sense oh yeah after everything that just transpired Cooper walks over to mr. C and puts the Al Cave wearing on his finger and his doppelganger finally returns to the Red Room one for the grandkids Cooper grabs the room key to the Great Northern from Frank and then things take a turn the moment he lays eyes on Nadeau and then we get a superimpose Dale Cooper like over the screen for like fades in and out at points it was really weird but then I realized that this is probably the moment that he realizes that he's in the dream the whole Twin Peaks gang shows up like it's the ending of The Wizard of Oz and then Cooper explains now there are some things that will change the past dictates the future Naruto goes over to Cooper and they touch hands her face starts to smoke and Diane takes Naruto's place now with red hair okay okay okay okay yeah yeah sure and then we get the clock stuck ticking on 253 and then goes Cooper hits us with [Music] what the [ __ ] was that we live inside a dream Cooper tells everyone I hope I see all of you again the room goes dark again and somehow Cooper Diane and Gordon are walking in the boiler room at the Great Northern where James was looking around a few parts back the key opens the locked door and Cooper tells the crew did not follow him through and then he gives one final line to Diane see you at the curtain call Cooper meets up with Phillip Gerard and recites the fire walk with me chant one chance between two worlds they walk to our Philip Jeffries teapot is located in the red diamond City Motel Cooper then gives Jeffries the date February 23rd 1989 yeah so apparently Jeffries can send people through time or something you didn't know that already I also like that Jeffries has some sort of slight humanity left he says it's good to see you the whole Jeffries circumstance reminds me of captain Powell and John Carpenter's first film Dark Star they're the dead ship's captain is kept on ice for consultation and he's totally out of it when they talked to it next up we see the AL cave symbol transform into an infinity symbol and Gerard screams electricity and coop is sent back to the moments right before Laura Palmer's death in fire walk with me so I took that as like just that the infinity sign like this is time and then the little ball boom this is where we're gonna send you and move you from one place to the other mm-hmm Cooper appears in the woods and sees Laura and James from the exact same scene from fire walk with me right before Laura says her final goodbyes to James in the original scene they ride a little and Laura jumps off the bike to meet Leo jocks in renee now in this reality Laura starts walking and she sees Cooper standing in the woods I see new entry [Music] Cooper reaches his hand out to her and everything from the past starts to change Laura Palmer's body wrapped in plastic flickers out of existence and Pete Martel finally goes fishing Laura asks Cooper where are we going and Cooper hits us with we're going home all right and that's it everything's fixed goodnight folks that was perfect I loved it from there at the present-day Palmer House there's moaning in the distance it's Sarah crying in the living room she grabs Laura's picture and stabs it with a bottle over and over back in the woods Cooper tries to take Laura to the portal for the White Lodge even though they were holding hands we hear that strange clicking noise from part one and Laura is suddenly gone she can be heard screaming just like in part one the woods turned to a stage at the Roadhouse Julie Cruise is singing the world spins for the final performance of the return when part 17 ended you and I were both looking a Charlie that felt complete to me like that was it he got Bob gone and Laura's back in the lodge or whatever is going on like if you're gonna end it there that's fine that would've been a cool ending but we got a better one okay let's do this are you sure yes we have to talk about part 18 but things might change whatever I don't care electricity good part 18 is where the return departs from the original Twin Peaks storyline proper and has been the subject of much speculation and disappointment for those who have been watching our recaps you will remember that my wingnut theory after part 16 was that the conclusion would be a prequel like fire walk with me I was partially right about that but I also warned that some things will remain unresolved and we should be prepared I actually love the dreamy darkness of part 18 I believe this series is complete with this conclusion it gave me the impression of a grandeur designed beyond a supernatural murder mystery of the original series blossoming with a cosmic battle caused by man-made self-destruction a fight between light and darkness that has entered its house with time and dimension traveling FBI agents weren't to defend the good rolled into it before we go any further I want to say a few things about reading Lynch over the last 20 years of his career he's developed a film grammar around dreams reflections and perception he began with a simple story of a flawed marriage expressed through the subjective and transformative lens of the kind of psychosis and paranoia that can arise in that space after a statement digression that showed he could peacefully ruminate on aging in a simple straight story Lynch moved into Mahal and drive [Music] the film was originally intended to be a television series but fate would have it that he would instead transform the pilot into a feature film about the ravages of Hollywood and how its bleak male-dominated soul grinder would even turn women who loved one another against each other in that film it takes an accident literally a car accident to give the soul of Camila Rhodes the rare transcendental opportunity to perceive the recurring destructive cycle for what it is and what it is has plenty of room for interpretation between the forces of pure evil pure good and every pawn in between their struggle like twin peaks' Mulholland Drive is filled with curious transitions time shifts doppelgangers and other dreamlike elements and you were there and you were there and you were there lastly Inland Empire is probably the height of untethered David Lynch if you thought aspects of the returner inscrutable I challenge you to unpack Inland Empire at three hours shot entirely on mini DV and positively bananas full disclosure I never unpacked it myself I could only sit through it once and for as intrigued as I was I couldn't go back in and you were there and you were there and you were there and that's what's brought us to where we are today finally we get to Twin Peaks the return an eighteen part film that builds upon Lynch's fascination with dreaming in collaboration with Mark Frost and sourcing out of their works from 25 years ago and most recently Frost's novel the secret history of Twin Peaks the return is not different from these other works by Lynch it is likely mechanically or narrative Lee sound at least I should say the return specifically it is possible that the design for the return is not entirely mechanically sound with the original series or even fire walk with me there is also so much more to deconstruct than we've ever had before eighteen parts that drawing a solid conclusion or a correct interpretation will take more than just a few days and crucial further viewing most importantly its interpretation is more up to you the viewer to find personally than it is to conclude a narrative final summation [ __ ] if we ask you to tell him your life story [ __ ] hours that said we will hazard such a conclusion here and my theory that follows is the correct interpretation just kidding this is my best first swing and something that I hope to look at more deeply for some time to come in part 18 we depart from Twin Peaks and move into uncharted territory mr. Cooper burns in the Red Room Mike manufactures a new dougie ganger for Janie e Dale has definitely lost Laura Palmer as we hear the sound from the phonograph in part 1 followed by Laura's screen that scream Laura's scream we've now heard so many times especially in just these two parts that it's becoming like the famous Wilhelm scream we go back to the Red Room or events from the beginning of the return play out again but with variation significantly the evolved arm says I read this as implying that the original Twin Peaks universe was perhaps the wrong occurring timeline in which to reacquire Laura following this Dale exits the Red Room via the door he attempted to exit through in part two here he is reunited with Diane is he really in this moment our time-traveling duo is finally united this is where Dell was trying to go all along but couldn't because of his split existence the curtains fade and soon they're on the open road Diane questions whether they should go through with their plan but Dale is insistent they reached the dividing line 430 miles exactly from somewhere or someone else the biggest electrical wires we've seen in the entire series are humming echoing Dale's warning at the Sheriff's Department they kiss knowing they may not see each other again for a long time next it's nighttime the mood is different they stop at a motel where Diane sees another version of herself outside what follows is an awkward lovemaking scene reminiscent of the one in Lost Highway the platters my prayer plays as Diane goes into a darker and darker space in the morning she is gone but has left a note dear Richard Richard when you read this I'll be gone please don't try to find me I don't recognize you anymore bring him whatever it was we had together is over Linda so here we finally get Richard and Linda they have transformed and by moving through time / reality have forgotten each other Linda's note echos the loss of knowing someone from the audrey and charlie scenes you tally the side effects of time travel i imagine this has happened many times a tragic professional hazard for time coups Richards reaction is not immediately understanding of this change either does he remember his meeting the firemen side note props to all the predictors who had Diane as both Naito and Linda that was great on the anagram theory good job guys I honestly didn't think that was the case but [ __ ] when Richard emerges from the motel room it is an entirely different motel and possibly an entirely different time he glances back at the room has always forgotten something he can't place has he forgotten Diane he drives into Odessa Texas population ninety nine thousand nine hundred and forty I looked this up this was the population from the 2010 census which places his instance at roughly that time he drives to a diner called eat at Judy's side note the real world restaurant is called eat at Rudy's and it's in Wilmington California I'll bet the owner has no idea what they signed up for when they decided to do Twin Peaks they're about to have years of twin peaks' fans streaming through that diner here Richard encounter some rude gun-toting Texans that he quickly inefficiently dispatches I'm gonna credit mark frost with getting one more gun proliferation jab in before the series was up Richard then gets the waitress to write down the address of the other waitress who works there this is an interesting scene because it's apparent that Richard is a full Cooper he is methodical and a bit cold like mr. C but still somewhat considerate where do you hang this finally he arrives at the home of the other waitress the number six pole from the fat trap trailer park is here the woman who answers the door is played by Sheryl Lee but she insists she is not Laura Palmer but Carrie Paige no relation however she does show some recognition at the mention of Sarah Palmer he implores her to join him on a trip to Twin Peaks which she agrees to because well she's got her own problems my original read on the rest of part 18 was that Dale had quantum leaped into a timeline without Laura and just doppelganger or possibly Topa of Laura and that he had simply failed this mission this instance however now I think that Laura could be a time agent too and just as capable of forgetting herself as the others the dead man in her home has been shot in the head but he also has a gut wound that looks conspicuously like a bad orb may have emerged but was destroyed by agent Palmer also in that scene take note of that white horse is behind that blue plate we always thought that the white horses represent death suffering drugs and they're always around Sarah Palmer which makes people think now that that white horse might represent Judy as well I believe that yeah I mean now that we have that hindsight it seems so much more clear I mean and think about an episode a dark what transpires next is possibly the most harrowing ly slow sequence of the entire series [Music] yeah slower than that they drive from Odessa Texas to Twin Peaks Washington so to be totally fair in Twin Peaks formal cadence it's totally appropriate there's no sir Davos speedy fast travel in this finale just to move things along eventually they arrive in Twin Peaks they passed the Double R and are soon at the Palmer House here Richard introduces himself as Special Agent Dale Cooper there are a host of possibilities at this point he transitioned back to coop when he left the motel or that Richard believes he is in the twin peaks' timeline where he should impersonate Cooper whatever the case Sarah Palmer does not live at the house anymore or never did we learned it was formerly owned by mrs. Chalfont and currently belongs to a lustrum ond and her husband mrs. turmond of course and her grandson are memorable from earlier twin peaks' cannon she gave Lora the picture of the transition space that leads sometimes of the Red Room and recently to the limbo version of the red diamond motel mrs. Chaplin is also the former owner of the trailer underneath which Chester Desmond discovered the AL cave ring before disappearing from reality if this is around 2010 we can conclude that in this reality or timeline the ciao fans did better financially but are still somehow connected to the darkness so the journey was a bust Richard and Kerry returned to the street where Richard pauses trying to figure out his missteps or miscalculation he asks what year is this moments later Sara Palmer's voice from Episode one of the original Twin Peaks calls out for Laura then Carrie lets out the Laura scream the lights go out in the Tremont home electricity pops and we go to black ominous dark Badalamenti music fades in followed by Laura whispering into Dale's ear in the Red Room my read is that Kerry realize she was Laura screamed and straight up popped the timeline out of existence the submission from that reality was complete this universe is bob was dead and Dale had located Laura back in the red room Laura's whispering to Dale again this time about the next reality that time coop will be sent to I liked that theory a lot but I read the ending slightly different first off I believe coop and Diane entered Judy's reality time line dimension whatever you want to call it judy steals away Laura when coop is rescuing her and Diane and coop give chase here Richard and Linda seem to be indistinguishable from their doppelgangers Diane retains all the trauma of her doppelganger which we see from her car and Cooper maintains many of the characteristics of mr. C I don't know if the oil is hot enough to set off those bullets but I'd move away now Diane falls into Judy's ugly reality and becomes Linda to Cooper's Richard and this is the moment I couldn't help but think of money the all-time greatest films ever made and one of my favorites Alfred Hitchcock's vertigo Richard mirrors so much of Scotty from vertigo that's impossible not to notice [Music] two men that are engulfed in a dream that they can't seem to break one damn there goes insane for a love that's not real and the other is driven by his FBI detective morals to finish a case no matter the cost I believe Judy tried to stop coop from his mission and have him fall into the fake world just like Diane did hence the motel shifting before and after Diane and Cooper stay or Laura being off at work that day at Judy's also the dead body another attempt by Judy to make Dale question whether or not this is truly Laura but coop remembers what the fireman tells him and he takes Carrie back to the Palmer home of course Sarah isn't there and Cooper is almost ready to give in at this point he's looking for any sign of help it even looks like he's possibly looking for Mike to help out when he slumps down but then he says what year is this Sarah reaches out to Laura and Laura suddenly remembers everything she becomes Laura again the electricity goes out in the Palmer House and Judy is defeated that's what I got who knows how this theory holds up in the next days weeks months yours I don't know it's gonna probably evolve a million times from now I mean it should take some time you know when I was younger I watched Mulholland Drive five times in a movie theater and sit down at a cafe and figure it out over a few hours well this is an 18 part series and that's just this part of that and just to get the like crucial second viewing out is gonna is an eight-hour journey and that's it for us over here everybody thank you so much for watching this has been an honor and a privilege to get to talk about Twin Peaks every single week I loved it I mean these are some of my favorite filmmakers and special thanks to Mark Frost David Lynch the great cinematography from Peter Deming expert cutting by Duane Dunham and music supervision by Dean Hurley Kyle MacLachlan Laura Dern Naomi Watts the whole cast of the series and of course everybody who's watched it with us joined us in the comments hit us on Twitter it's been wonderful what are you doing this isn't over yet I'm gonna go find Audrey goddamnit what recap is this [Music]
