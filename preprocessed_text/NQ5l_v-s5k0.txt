Welcome to Cinema Summary, ladies and gentlemen. People change right? Sometimes for the worse, and sometimes for the better. But let's see how bad people can get This is The Invitation So, the first things we see are Will and Kira in a car, and they have been invited to a reunion dinner with some old friends of Will. And Will is anxious about going: It\xe2\x80\x99s been a while since he\xe2\x80\x99s talked to these friends, and the dinner is being hosted by Eden and David, Will\xe2\x80\x99s ex-wife, and David, her current husband. On their way there, they run into a coyote that Will has to put it out of its misery: killing it with a tire iron. *Yelp of Pain* and they continue on until finally they get to Eden\xe2\x80\x99s fancy house in Hollywood Hills. It's the same house that Will and Eden shared back when they were married. As he walks in, Will can\xe2\x80\x99t help but think about Ty, his son. Who used to live in the house with them When he comes out of his flashback, he\xe2\x80\x99s warmly greeted by his old friends: Gina, Tommy, Miguel, Ben, and Claire although they are missing someone else and that's Choi, Gina\xe2\x80\x99s boyfriend. and after the realize this, that\xe2\x80\x99s when Eden comes downstairs and she\xe2\x80\x99s happy, she\xe2\x80\x99s touchy-feely, and as she says hello to Will Maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s her smile or the way she\xe2\x80\x99s acting, but something about her is off. and it\xe2\x80\x99s very awkward for everyone involved and it only gets worse when we meet David: Eden\xe2\x80\x99s current husband, who kind of looks like a mirror image of Will down to the beard and green shirt. Except, David is also like Eden: being touchy-feely, and happy, and creepy. Then David gives everyone some wine and makes a toast and during the toast, Will looks away and spots a half naked woman standing in a doorframe of a bedroom who smiles at him and leaves and moments later we are introduced to Sadie the woman that Will saw earlier and she\xe2\x80\x99s a bit of a weirdo and very quirky, and no one know who she is or why she\xe2\x80\x99s here except Eden and David Who know her from the support group in Mexico She\xe2\x80\x99s staying with them to 'help out' And after an awkward silence, Kira breaks the ice by talking about the coyote that was killed by Will. and everyone\xe2\x80\x99s put off by the story except for Sadie, who thinks that\xe2\x80\x99s pretty cool and David who respects Will for killing the coyote out of mercy, and taking away its pain. So Will decides to take the chance to go to the kitchen to look around and see how the house has changed (but you can tell he just wants some space), and as he stands near the sink, he has another flashback: to a memory of Eden trying to kill herself. She\xe2\x80\x99s so different now. It\xe2\x80\x99s strange. That\xe2\x80\x99s when Eden decides to come in and get some glasses and we find out that things have changed: now the windows have bars on them, and that ever since Mexico, Eden has been better. More stable, having gotten over whatever caused her to try and kill herself. But as Will listens to Eden, he feels that something\xe2\x80\x99s off about her. But Eden reassures Will that she\xe2\x80\x99s okay and is \xe2\x80\x98over it\xe2\x80\x99, whatever that is and she wants Will to be \xe2\x80\x98over it\xe2\x80\x99 too. As Will comes out of the kitchen he spots David on the phone and then a few moments the door bell rings At first everyone think it\xe2\x80\x99s Choi, Gina\xe2\x80\x99s boyfriend who still hasn\xe2\x80\x99t shown up, but its actually Pruitt. A friend of Sadie, Eden, and David. A friend, the rest of group have never met. *Confused and uncomfortable stuttering* Well you got to admit inviting 2 strangers to a reunion dinner By the way, where\xe2\x80\x99s Choi? He should have been here by now! And Gina tries to call him but can\xe2\x80\x99t due to bad phone reception. And then, David locks the door but Will feels that it\xe2\x80\x99s unnecessary for David to do that and calls him out on it and although they don\xe2\x80\x99t make a big deal out of it, David does leave the key in the door but leaves it locked. After that \xe2\x80\x98confrontation-conversation\xe2\x80\x99, Eden asks Will to get some firewood from outside and on his way out, Will passes a room. And he almost goes in but for some reason, decides not to. Outside, he remembers hearing the voice of his son, Ty, playing in the backyard and as he stands there, he spots Eden in her bedroom, hiding \xe2\x80\x98something\xe2\x80\x99 in a drawer. Will comes back inside and decides to go to the bedroom, where he finds a bottle of pills in the drawer and decides to keep one. As he is about to sneak out, David catches him but lets him stay in the room. To let Will come to terms with the changes in the house and Will stays there, remembering better times with Eden. Remembering their son, who we still haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen or heard mentioned about around the house. Back in the common room, the group realize that Eden, Sadie, Pruitt, and David are part of a cult. And while they are totally denying it they explain what it is It's called The Invitation, and back in Mexico, Eden and David met each other there and they describe it more like a 'support group' to help people get over their grief and pain. It\xe2\x80\x99s not just popular in Mexico, it's also popular in America "Here in LA, New York". As David explains that there are thousands of other cultists. Uh... "group members" In the LA/New York Area The group tries to politely ask them for more details and David decides to show them a video on his laptop. And it\xe2\x80\x99s a recruitment video: hosted by Dr. Joseph, the cult leader, who teaches some spiritual, New Age ways to deal with trauma and the pain of loss. It\xe2\x80\x99s pretty normal until we see a woman dying from cancer as she talks about the afterlife with the cult leader, and as she dies, the cult leader tries to reassure the people in the video that she is in a better place. and the video ends and the group realize they just watched someone die and they are either grossed out, freaked out, or trying to be respectful of their beliefs' with it. Except Pruitt, Eden, Sadie, and David. Who insist that \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing\xe2\x80\x9d. Turning pain into something positive; getting rid of your fear of death. David insists that the cult is GOOD and almost mentions what happened between Eden and Will but Will stops him from talking about it. That\xe2\x80\x99s when Eden praises it and says it\xe2\x80\x99s transformed her life and she\xe2\x80\x99s better for it. But, overwhelmed, Will leaves for the kitchen, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe for a second that she\xe2\x80\x99s actually gotten over what happened between Will and her. When he finally goes back to the common room, David apologizes for what he showed and to make up for it, he suggests that they play a game. A game called \xe2\x80\x9cI Want\xe2\x80\x9d: It\xe2\x80\x99s a game that David and Eden played back in Mexico and it\'s kind of like "I Have Never". so, Sadie goes first and what she wants to do is tell everyone she loves them and then makes out with Gina. Rules are pretty clear: You get what you want! Fun if a bit weird. Gina goes next and she hesitantly says that she wants cocaine, and David has some and gives it to her (much to everyone\xe2\x80\x99s surprise). And then Pruitt goes next and goes into great detail about his ex-wife. How he accidentally killed her, in the kitchen after hitting her so hard that she knocked her head and he went to jail, and he found \xe2\x80\x98religion\xe2\x80\x99 in the cult, and now he's over it He stills misses her but he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t feel the pain of loss: after all, he will see her in the afterlife.. And after THAT, everyone\xe2\x80\x99s super uncomfortable that was weird, inappropriate and it feels like Pruitt is trying to persuade them to join the cult. And then it's Eden's turn and she wants to kiss Ben and SHE KISSES Ben with tongue and everything. By this point, Claire has had enough of this \xe2\x80\x98weirdness\xe2\x80\x99 and just wants to leave although David tries to get her to stay. But a stern word from Will, gets David to back off and they let her go with Pruitt going with her to move his car since his car is in the way. And Will can\xe2\x80\x99t help but watch from the window with suspicion, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t trust Pruitt; and that\xe2\x80\x99s when David takes him aside to chat privately. And he lays it on Will: since the beginning of the night, Will has been so suspicious of them for no reason. Always questioning him about things like locking the doors, or watching Pruitt drive his car out of the way. He just wants Will to relax, and Will confesses that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really want to be here because he\xe2\x80\x99s not ready to be here. and David kind of understands with the y'know, the divorce thing, and that OTHER THING But Will just wants him to stop talking about it Then the group go upstairs to eat a lavish dinner and talk about their lives Leaving Will to his thoughts as he remembers the past: he remembers he was at a fifth birthday of some kid and something happened involving a bat, a scream, and overall it\xe2\x80\x99s a very confusing moment, that\xe2\x80\x99s made worse when he begins to have a panic attack His anxiety builds up until the moment we see him scream! and then it cuts to black and then the movie continues. So outside, Will stands beside the pool, trying to make a call when Sadie comes by and she offers to have sex with him. And if Will wants to be a little rough with her Go for it. She likes it rough. And Will is weirded out by it, and he rejects her offer STERNLY and tells her to leave him alone and moments later Will gets a voice message from Choi and listens to it. In the message, Choi says that he came to the house early, but realized that he forgot dessert and he sent this voice mail to ask Will to bring cake on his way up. Choi was here earlier and went into the house. And now Will is sure that something dodgy and weird is going on here. And as Will goes back inside, the group sit at the dinner table as Eden gives Miguel a cake But now, Will is fuming and he can\xe2\x80\x99t hold back anymore and he demands to know where the F*** is Choi? Because I just got voice message from him, and Choi said that he was already here before at 7 way before everyone else, what is going on. But Eden and David both try to reassure him that Choi wasn't here and they haven't seen him This just makes Will angrier and he continues interrogating them: Something weird is going on in this house like Pruitt and Sadie. Who are they? Why are they here? And "The Invitation" video, what was up with that? That\xe2\x80\x99s when Will accuses Eden of being in denial: Supposedly joining a cult transformed her life? That is a lie. She is in denial, trying to ignore the fact that their son. Died. So this is why Ty was never mentioned or seen around the house: he died. That\xe2\x80\x99s why Will has those flashbacks and from those flashbacks we can figure out what happened to Ty: that on Ty\xe2\x80\x99s 5th birthday, there was an accident, he was playing with another kid And Ty got hit by bat This is what I was talking about earlier: This is what Eden and Will have been avoiding this whole time: Talking about their son\xe2\x80\x99s death, because the pain is still there And  they are not over it. Especially Will. That\xe2\x80\x99s when the doorbell rings and it\xe2\x80\x99s Choi! Turns out he really was here before but never entered the house because he was called back to work and left before and that's why he's just arrived now. And then Will breaks down, apologizing for what he said and he goes to the bathroom to cool his head. And he remembers washing Ty\xe2\x80\x99s small hands. He can\xe2\x80\x99t stand being inside and so he goes out. Where he sits with Kira and he confesses that he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t gotten over Ty\xe2\x80\x99s death and we get a deep look into Will\xe2\x80\x99s mental state: He\xe2\x80\x99s broken and suicidal, he can\xe2\x80\x99t get over his son\xe2\x80\x99s death, and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe that Eden can just move on and forget their son like that. And when Will goes back inside, he goes to see Ty\xe2\x80\x99s room, the room that he passed by and almost went into earlier. Here inside, the room he remembers Ty his toys left on the floor, and as he lies on the bed he remembers his son\xe2\x80\x99s face, but all of that is now gone. And while in this room, Will sees David walking outside, and lighting a red lantern. David seems to be waiting for something, watching for something. Maybe he was wrong, earlier about Choi but Will\xe2\x80\x99s gut feeling returns. There\xe2\x80\x99s something off about tonight\xe2\x80\x99s dinner. Will snoops around until he finds and opens David\xe2\x80\x99s Laptop, where he sees the rest of video: The cult leader is there calling for his followers to do something on this night, ominously saying \xe2\x80\x9cTonight is the night, our faith is made real\xe2\x80\x9d. Whatever that means, it sounds like something bad is going to happen. So Will goes back upstairs, where the group is served wine glasses, and Will notices the way Eden and David are serving the wine. Like they\xe2\x80\x99re excited for something. He has a bad feeling about this and just before they all drink (except for Gina who sneaks a sip): Will breaks his glass and knocks the cup out of everyone\xe2\x80\x99s hands, telling them not to drink it. Sadie gets pissed and attacks Will, screaming at him \xe2\x80\x9cYou ruined everything!\xe2\x80\x9d only to be pushed off by Will, slamming her head into a cupboard. And she doesn't get up after that This is bad, but it gets worse when Kira notices Gina, foaming at the mouth. She is unresponsive as well Miguel rushes to gives her CPR as Ben tries to call the police but he can\xe2\x80\x99t get reception, and no one knows what\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with Gina, and the doors are locked so they can't get out and as Miguel tries to save her life. He\xe2\x80\x99s shot. By David. Things are getting out of hand the guests back away from David as Sadie wakes up, and Pruitt is able to calm David down and take the gun away from him. Only to shoot Choi, dead. Furious, Tommy tries to attack David only to get cut by Sadie, as the rest of the group runs downstairs and try to leave. But the doors are locked and the windows are barred. There\xe2\x80\x99s no way out Downstairs, Will is attacked by Sadie but he manages to knock her down and run into Eden\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom where he and Kira barricade the door behind them. They try to leave through the glass door but its locked so they\xe2\x80\x99re gonna have to break it open but then they hear a noise. Outside, they see Ben come running out of the house. Only to get killed by David and Pruitt. This might be their last chance to escape, and as Kira and Will sneak out of the bedroom, they overhear Eden and David talking. Eden is shocked It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t supposed to be like this everyone was supposed to die peacefully from the poisoned wine, so they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have do this. and as Eden\xe2\x80\x99s guilt eats away at her, David convinces her to join him and kill the rest of the group. It\xe2\x80\x99s the only way they can get over their pain. As David and Eden walk away to hunt them down, Kira and Will continue sneaking out only to spot Sadie bleeding out on the couch, with a firepoker in her hand. Will takes her firepoker and goes upstairs with Kira. Because he remembers that there was a door to the garage but when they get there it\xe2\x80\x99s gone. Because the house has been remodeled, and now there\xe2\x80\x99s no way out. And to make matters worse, Pruitt is walking up the stairs, ready to kill them. So, Will and Kira hide until just at the right moment they strike! And Pruitt takes a few hits before he sucker punches Kira, and begins choking out Will who is saved by Kira at the last moment who kills Pruitt Just as they\xe2\x80\x99re about to leave, Will is shot by Eden, who frantically apologizes to him before she shoots herself. That\xe2\x80\x99s when they hear David: walking up the stairs with a knife in hand, and as David is about to reach them, he\xe2\x80\x99s attacked and killed by Tommy. And then someone calls out to Will, it\xe2\x80\x99s Eden: Who with her final breath, confesses that she never got over Ty\xe2\x80\x99s death, and asks Will if she can be taken outside where she dies. So Tommy, Kira, and Will, are the only survivors of the Reunion. It\xe2\x80\x99s over and they\xe2\x80\x99re safe now but Will sees something, past the Red Lantern that David lit, and then we see: across the valley, across Hollywood Hills, different houses with their own red lanterns glowing in the night. And Kira and Will can only watch and listen to the sounds of sirens and screams echoing throughout the night So what just happened? Well, if you remember from earlier David lights a red lantern in his backyard, and then looks out into the distance, searching for something. What is he looking for? He's looking for other red lanterns. because earlier in the film, David mentions that there are thousands of other cult members in the LA/NY area which explains why all the other houses have the red lanterns: they are full of other cult members who are killing their guests and are going to kill themselves It\xe2\x80\x99s kinda sad that so many rich people in the most expensive real estate properties in the US could be so miserable. I guess money doesn't buy you happiness Which brings me to my next point: Why kill people and what does that have to do with being free from pain? David explains to Eden that killing people is the only way to be free from pain but there's more to it than just that If you remember from the video, the cult leader tells his followers that "tonight is the night, our faith is made real." What he means by this, is that after tonight: After the guests are killed and the cult members are dead. They will all go to the afterlife where they will reunite with their loved ones And they will live happily ever after, free from pain, free from sorrow Although they were supposed to die together, which is why Sadie freaks out when Will stopped knocks the glasses away from everyone's hands and this isn\xe2\x80\x99t too far fetched from reality there have been cases of real life cults doing a kind of similar thing like in Jonestown or in Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s Gate. And in fact, Dr. Joseph, the cult leader of the Invitation cult, kind of looks like the Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s Gate guy. Anyways, thank you so much for watching ladies and gentlemen If you enjoyed it, leave a like down below and subscribed to get updated on our latest uploads Now if you will excuse me I have a reunion dinner to attend
