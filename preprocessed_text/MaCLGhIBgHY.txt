Welcome to Cinema Summary, ladies and gentlemen. Now let me tell you a story about 2 stinking rats crawling around South Boston\xe2\x80\x99s criminal underworld. Ya get me? Okay. Because this The Departed So the movie takes place in Boston, where we follow Collin Sullivan. Who we meet initially as a boy, who is sort of brought up by this guy, Frank Costello, a real piece of work and all around Irish-American mobster. Someone you really don\xe2\x80\x99t want to mess with. When Collin gets old enough he studies at the police academy. But he\xe2\x80\x99s not the only one studying here: This is Billy Castigan Jr. and both of them graduate and become officers of the law. But suspiciously, our boy Collin has still got ties with Frank even as he becomes a detective. But then again, so does Billy. Because the thing about Billy is that his family \xe2\x80\x93 his uncle and father \xe2\x80\x93 were in with the Irish mob But him? He\xe2\x80\x99s trying to get away from it all. But that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t stop people giving him a hard time when he tries to apply for a State Trooper position Why are you pretending to be a cop? As Sergeant Dignam over here is very keen to supply As opposed to Collin, whose warmly welcomed to the Special Investigations Unit, whose sole mission is to bring down the Costello crime empire. Collin is an investigator. Whereas Billy has a different gig that's much more difficult He is an undercover cop. and with a 'colorful' family background and a false conviction here. He\xe2\x80\x99s the perfect undercover agent, willing to go the whole nine yards of being in prison in order to bring down Frank's empire When he finally gets out he tries to get in good with the criminal element. Whereas Collin\xe2\x80\x99s cushy investigation has him trying to figure out where a bunch of microchips are being transported around Boston by Frank, and in the office, he starts a little romance with Madolyn, a police psychologist. Whereas Billy is more or less fortunate, having a run in with Frank who rightfully suspects Billy of being an undercover cop. "Are you still a cop!?" "NO!" But Billy manages to get him off his back. Or at least his arm. and gets close to working with Frank and his inner ring although his investigation is redirected to focus on some microchips that Frank is selling to China. The same microchips that Collin is investigating, who just so happens to be heading his own subunit of the SIU He got promoted, which is good for a snake in the grass, like Collin. But it\xe2\x80\x99s after having a session with Madolyn (and a potential invitation to a cup of coffee), that Billy finds out from Dignam that Frank has a mole in the SIU. Speaking of Collin, he\xe2\x80\x99s going in with the SIU to do a sting operation on the microchips, Frank is trying to sell. With Collin\xe2\x80\x99s team standing by for Captain Queenan\xe2\x80\x99s inside man (a.k.a. Billy) to give them a call to green light the operation. If they do this right: It\xe2\x80\x99ll be a huge hit against Frank Costello. Though that might be problem since Collin is here, and he warns Frank that the cops are onto him. Explicitly telling him to turn off their cellphones. But that\xe2\x80\x99s the not the only problem, the FBI is in on this operation but they screwed up! their surveillance cameras have a blindspot. They cannot see the actual transaction of microchips and with Frank\xe2\x80\x99s men having their cellphones turned off, Billy can\xe2\x80\x99t make a call. But he can send a text, telling Queenan, the buyer of the microchips is there. But that\xe2\x80\x99s all they can do and the trade goes off without a hitch. But now, Collin and Billy both know that a mole exists. That Frank has a spy in the SIU and that Queenan has a spy in Frank\xe2\x80\x99s inner ring. What they don\xe2\x80\x99t know is who the mole is. With Billy himself finding out from 'someone', that Costello is a protected FBI informant. Which is why he never gets busted: Costello gives up information to the FBI about criminals and they make sure he stay on the streets and not in jail. It\xe2\x80\x99s intel that Billy gives to Queenan as soon as he can. Though its after this, that Billy is called in by Mr. French, an associate of Frank\xe2\x80\x99s, to write down his real name, his social security, his bank account, and license numbers. Collin is tasked with smoking out the mole in SIU and that night, Billy goes after Frank, trying to get back the envelope full of his personal information. Frank gives Collin the envelopes and Collin leaves with Billy in pursuit. Though by the end of the night neither of them know who the mole is and after being unable to find any info on any of Frank\xe2\x80\x99s crew. Collin has Queenan followed to a meeting with Billy and calls up Frank\xe2\x80\x99s guys to take them out. But Queenan distracts them long enough to get Billy out of there only to wind up dead. Thrown out of a window When Frank\xe2\x80\x99s guys try to escape, they're fired upon by the cops who were tailing Queenan who manage to hit Delahunt, one of Frank\xe2\x80\x99s guys. and now with Queenan dead, everything that he had on him is stored into evidence including his cellphone used to contact Billy. and Collin tries to get Billy to come in, TRYING to smoke out the mole but that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work and as he reads Queenan\xe2\x80\x99s diary he finds out that Frank is an informant for the FBI. Something that Billy found out earlier and later that night, on then news, it\xe2\x80\x99s revealed that Delahunt was an FBI informant. and it\xe2\x80\x99s sometime after that, the cops track Frank to a coke drop off (with Billy\xe2\x80\x99s help) and a shootout ensues with Frank almost escaping before getting gunned down by Collin after Frank admits that he\xe2\x80\x99s an FBI informant to Collin So Collin\xe2\x80\x99s a big hero for killing Frank Costello Whoop-de-do! Big hero! and when he get\xe2\x80\x99s back, Billy\xe2\x80\x99s waiting for him at his office Wanting to have his identity given back to him But when he sees the envelopes that Frank gave to Collin on Collin\xe2\x80\x99s desk, he runs away, realizing that Collin is Frank's rat And realizing that Billy now knows this, Collin deletes his police record. Billy goes to Madolyn to give her an envelope that she keeps hidden, before she reveals to Collin that she\xe2\x80\x99s pregnant (with Collin unaware she had an affair with Billy); Remember that invitation to some 'coffee' earlier? It paid off. it's later however that Collin catches her listening to a CD from Billy that has a recording of Collin\xe2\x80\x99s conversations with Frank on it. So, Collin calls Billy who reveals that Frank recorded all of their conversations and that Frank\xe2\x80\x99s lawyer was supposed to give this whole collection of CDs to Billy. Who will use it to get Collin arrested unless he gives Billy his identity back, and they agree to meet where Queenan died. Where Billy handcuffs Collin, intending to arrest him although Trooper Brown shows up, drawing his gun. As Billy explains that Collin was Frank\xe2\x80\x99s rat and asks Brown why he didn\xe2\x80\x99t bring Dignam, it's a question Brown doesn\xe2\x80\x99t answer (or maybe he can't) So Billy takes Collin down in the elevator where as soon as it opens: Trooper Barrigan shoots Billy dead and then he shoots Trooper Brown when he comes down. Guess what? Trooper Barrigan is also another one of Frank\xe2\x80\x99s moles. But it don't end well for Barrigan because uh... Collin just shoots him. Who frames Barrigan for Billy and Brown's murder It\xe2\x80\x99s after Billy\xe2\x80\x99s funeral that Collin returns home to find former Sergeant Dignam waiting for him who avenges Captain Queenan and Billy With a clean shot to the head. Good riddance. So that ending was a little abrupt, kind of came out of nowhere, and was a very ambiguous and you can interpret it in 1 of 2 ways #1) You can interpret it as Dignam being another one of Frank's moles who was cleaning house and tying up loose ends in order to cover his own butt. Which makes sense since Trooper Barrigan does say "What you thought you were the only mole in the police force?" So there's some evidence to back up this interpretation but there's a more simpler explanation and that is: Former Sergeant Dignam avenging the deaths of Captain Queenan and of course! Billy Castigan Jr., after he found out that Collin was the mole as to what I believe? I subscribe to the second interpretation, that sometime after Billy's death, he received that envelope from Madolyn which has some evidence or has something that reveals Collin's status as a mole and after reading "this", he then takes matters into his own hands and takes out Collin and that last shot with the rat on the windowsill, is a little reference to the fact that wherever you go in this movie There's always gonna be someone keeping secrets and telling lies like police and criminals, and men and women. With women like Madolyn and Gwen Costello (Frank's wife) Now Madolyn is a liar, she outright tells a lie to Collin that he is the father of her baby When in fact, it's actually Billy and we know this from 3 points of evidence. #1 it's been established that Collin has some "trouble" performing in bed. #2. There's a sex scene with Madolyn and Billy and sometime after that scene is when she confirms that she's pregnant. So there's a chronology to it And thirdly, after receiving the conversations that Collin had with Frank. She says to Collin's face "And I thought I was the only liar." Pretty irrefutable evidence, don't ya think? which brings me to Gwen Costello, Frank\'s wife, that woman in the background whose always... "there" Especially when Frank is having a very important conversation with someone on the phone. There's always these shots that linger on her in the background, where she's listening in, doing her own thing. Now I'm not saying 100% that she's some sort of rat or mole or spy... but it really raises a few eyebrows as to what she's hiding and who she's listening in for. Maybe it's for another mob, an Irish mob, or an Italian mob, maybe even another branch of the federal police Like the FBI, who knows. But that's just my theory, what do you guys think? Was Billy the father of Madolyn's child, and was Gwen a 'mole' or was she hiding something?
