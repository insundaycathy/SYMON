before we begin, let me stop by saying, i'm going to start with the moral of this story, which is, be sure to find your soul mate when you're young, so when you're old and your ass cheeks at your ankles, you'll still have somebody to bone. the stars of our movie today are alan, but they cast the wrong guy, because sunshine was the hot one. like looking in the mirror some mean girl and their old fart counterparts. but thank god for him, because these good old actors salvage this movie barely play. our story begins with, oh, he's paddling to the old folks home where people go to die because their families don't want to change their depends. ain't that sweet? so this old man, noah, walks in to see his woman, like, okay, let's talk about our youth, because this old life is depressing. and look, noah, you don't look at nobody except ally. it's like the instant he saw her pituitary gland activated, armpit hair grow in and balls drop it. and he suddenly knew what it was to be a man. and he tries to date, and she be doing that hard to get. and no just goes watching her like a [ __ ] creeper. take it from jeb being a creeper, it don't work. and some of the ferris wheel seats got balls, some got seat belts, and apparently some don't have anything, because they just didn't care, because they wanted these characters to die, because they wanted this movie over as badly as i do. did he do some dumb [ __ ] to get her to go out on a date with him. and the next day he sees her out walking and says every beautiful thing you'd expect to hear from a perfect psychopath. and she is totally smitten and plays a little bit more that. hard to get. ladies, take it from a man. women, we don't really dig this hard to get nonsense. okay, women, if men do this, it ain't really that you that great. it's more likely that he's just about to nudge his fruitcake at christmas dinner. but this is a chick flick written by some widow who obviously don't get no loving. they see a movie, then he has a lie down in the middle of the street, putting a life in danger, while he tells us she needs to trust. then the next thing you know, you're watching 50 shades of grey, thinking, that's romantic. then he ties you up and says, it's because he loves you. and i lauded this. a bad message for young women. didn't they take a little break? and old alex says, they fell in love, didn't they? and old noah says, yep. then they got old and they about to die. and i'm looking at one of them right now. no, he didn't blow his cover that quick. then there wouldn't be a movie, god forbid. then they make out in front of everybody, and then they go for a bike ride. then she meets noah's daddy, and then they go swimming, and then they go swimming again, then they slap the [ __ ] out each other. and i'm gonna take a little break here from the jokers, because ladies, if your relationship looks like this, it ain't good, because it ain't cute. when he kisses the boo-boos that he made back to the funnest, then he goes to meet her family, and the dead air he talked like this. and this ain't necessary, unless you're a gospel preacher. as a southerner, i'm [ __ ] insulted. and they ask him what do you do, noah? and he's like, oh, i dress in a blatantly different color, so i stand out like a soft [ __ ] thumb. okay, paws. why does that rich girl get to date that poor boy, but ally can't date noah? i can tell you why right now. it's because he wore the right colored shirt. and while we're here, let me just say i know southern people, and let me tell you, it may look like the lifestyles of the rich and snobby, but everybody in this scene done. everyone else in this scene. see how that mama right there, that waiter. then they go swimming again, and then he grabs their boobies. then it makes her promise he's gonna turn this old piece of [ __ ] into a pretty white house with blue shutters, in a room where she can paint. then the pants come off, big surprise. and then the bra comes off. but no boobies for us, because that would have made this a good movie. god forbid. and then their friend, let's call him dingleberry, because they act like one, he busts in like alice's parents. this is the first night they've given up. she's out late, and noah is trash trash, trash, trashy, trashy, trash, trash. so he decided to take himself out get it, cause he trashed and look already showing early signs of dementia. getting out of my face. get the [ __ ] out. don't leave. i love you. i look, come back. come back. okay. [ __ ] you. then, and she still can't remember what to happen. this story is so bad that the main female character wanted to forget it. then ella's parents take her away a week early. so noah writes ali a letter every day for a year, but that mama, whoo. she a [ __ ]. well, can't be a roman story without a wall. oh. and then ally becomes a nurse to help all the men she sees as noah, even though she doesn't know noah's in the war because of mama intercepted all them letters because she's a so ella meets cyclops and gets a raging case of florence nightingale syndrome, without the body cast. i'm still sexy. and noah comes back from the wall, and his dad helps him by the dump. and he goes to charleston, where he sees ally with lawn and see this right here is the part where he should get some stranger off the street and pay her, like 20 from his army pension to pretend to be his woman in front of ali. see, you don't just sit in the damn window like you about to cry and wet yourself, you big damn baby. if you listen closely, you can hear the sound of his testicles receding. and then they'll go crazy. and then they finish the house, then they want to sell the [ __ ]. then they don't want to sell the [ __ ]. then if somebody else up in that [ __ ], then alice either he fixed that [ __ ], didn't she feign up in that [ __ ], then she salty about that. [ __ ]. then she come to visit, and they go for a swan filled paddle boat riding his dinger outside that [ __ ]. then they [ __ ] on his dinghy up in that [ __ ], which i don't really understand, because he gone full cast away up in this [ __ ]. he probably got a wilson hidden somewhere up in this [ __ ], he's that crazy. and since he ain't been manscaping, imagine the bush on that [ __ ]. then the girlfriend comes to visit all damn day. then ali spends the night, and noah guides under the painting room he built for and she paints nude. and then mama comes to visit, and she says, last night, when lon didn't hear from you, he decided to come. [Music]. and then mama takes ali for a little ride and reveals to her daughter that she too once took a ride on the dinghy of a greasy hobo. so she takes alley back to noah's, and she just so happens to bring ally all 365 of noah's letters. and ali's like, i'm going back to line. and noah's like, why? why would you leave this dysfunctional relationship? so alex drives off, and he's just standing there like, and can i just make a little reference here without trying to stay on key? no, no, no, no, no, no, no. hey, hey, hey, goodbye. and she reads some of his sappy damn letters and cleans us up a little bit before she goes to see lawn to tell him she spent the past few days getting a little dirty, like really dirty, like doing the dirty with the dirty. and lana's like, i can't live without you after she took a ride on that dirty dingy. okay, pause, since we're being realistic, this is total bullsh caps would have gone flying. there'd have been a shootout. that pretty little white house with the blue shutters would have been full of holes. paint jaws busted. that piano blowed up. the dinghy be sunk mono amano. but then this would have been a good movie, god forbid. and then, oh, noah, back here in the present, playing jokes on the senile woman, won't tell the end of the damn story. and she's like, who? who did? congratulations. you passed the senility test because you remembered the end of the story written by you for you, to be told to you by your husband, jebus. see, if this was me, i'd be whispering to her like, you didn't give him a goodbye [ __ ] did you break down coming in? five, four, three, two, [ __ ] one. and the next morning she see noah go by, but she ain't know him. and she looks around and is like, who are you people? and where's my horse? and then he goes to ali's room, and they [ __ ] die. they just [ __ ] die the end. but if this is the book, they would have lived long enough to bump uglies in the nursing home one last time. i just wanted to leave you with that disturbing image. people can twist that [ __ ] all they want, but she unbuttons his shirt and slips him some tongue. i swear to god they didn't die, because the writer made a sequel, and the old man is alive and kicking. just don't read it for yourself, or don't be sure to like, share and subscribe for your regular, realistic dose of meth. you can expect me to upload more videos after i forget i watch this movie. four movies explained. fall. i'm jeb a die. hey. hey. hey. goodbye.
