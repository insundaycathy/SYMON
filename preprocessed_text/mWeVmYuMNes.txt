Fear and Loathing is a movie about 2 protagonists: Raoul Duke and Dr. Gonzo, Duke is a journalist hired to do a story on the Mint 400 Motorcycle Race in Vegas and Dr. Gonzo is his attorney and fellow connoisseur of drugs, drink, and debauchery and both of them are here, hoping to find the American dream in Vegas. As we follow their journey, they find the Vegas Strip to be pleasantly disturbing but lacking in good moral or ethical code: people are here to pass the time, trying to find a bright spot in a dark life, with fake smiles and fake happiness They go from place to place, wreaking havoc and chaos wherever they go until their trip ends after a drug binge and other shenanigans, with Gonzo and Duke leaving Vegas behind and in turn the fear and loathing they felt there. Now, this video isn't built for summarizing film so much as it is for examining it, looking at the things that contributed to the story Because Fear and Loathing is based on a book that is sort of-semi fictional written by Hunter S. Thompson and based on his experiences that he had in Vegas so long ago Now the real events surrounding Fear and Loathing goes something like this: Thompson is hired by Sports Illustrated to do a piece on the Mint 400 Motorcycle race in the Nevada Desert, near Vegas However, while he\xe2\x80\x99s there what he ends up doing is writing the notes for Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, the book the film is based on. Now on his journey he was accompanied by Oscar \xe2\x80\x9cZeta\xe2\x80\x9d Cortez, a 300-pound-Chicano lawyer who was a key civil rights attorney and is portrayed by Benecio Del Toro Now Cortez was a good friend of Thompson's and was going to be interviewed by the journalist to get details on the aftermath of Ruben Salazar\xe2\x80\x99s death, a Mexican-American journalist and civil rights activist who would become a key figure in an article by Thompson called "Strange Rumblings in Aztlan\xe2\x80\x9d. After visiting Vegas, Thompson would return a month later to cover the District Attorney\xe2\x80\x99s Anti-Narcotics Convention which was in the movie but is depicted as happening within a weekend or so on the trip that Dr. Gonzo and Duke had Now, there are a few other things that the movie got right can be verified from secondary sources like the Debbie Reynolds show that Gonzo and Duke get kicked out of and the \xe2\x80\x9cBazooko Circus\xe2\x80\x9d casino which is actually the Circus Circus Las Vegas Hotel-Casino in real life. All of this is included and was directly or loosely based upon actual passages from Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s book whose own ideas are reflected in Raoul Duke. You see, Raoul Duke is essentially Hunter S. Thompson in all but name, as he also shares Hunter\xe2\x80\x99s views and stances: he's progressive, counter-cultural, anti-authoritarianism, and filled with patriotic passion for America and the ideas that America is based on. Fighting for justice in society when he felt so compelled to do so although we don\xe2\x80\x99t really see this in the film. something we do see throughout the film, however, are references to figures and events of the times: we see footage of what looks like a bomber flying overhead a tropical jungle, a reference to the Vietnam War, we see Nixon\xe2\x80\x99s appear on the TV, a reference to then President Richard Nixon, and even the Anti-Narcotics convention which did happen in real life, and was instigated by Nixon\xe2\x80\x99s War on Drugs. All of these are reminders of the failures of the Hippie movement, but more than that it\xe2\x80\x99s a peek into the life and times of Hunter S. Thompson in the wake of the 60s, of the Peace &amp; Love Movements, the Hippies and the things they fought for. Even the music that we hear throughout the film are period appropriate and were released within the timeframe of the 60s and 70s. Some examples of these \xe2\x80\x98older hippie songs\xe2\x80\x99 are White Rabbit, One Toke Over the Line, Sgt. Pepper\xe2\x80\x99s Lonely Hearts Club Band and Jumpin\xe2\x80\x99 Jack Flash.. and basically the American Dream that Duke wanted from the Hippie movement never really existed in the way he wanted it to be. The equality, the peace, the free love, the recreational drug use, and pursuit of self actualization amongst many other things that were fought for by the movement Got off the ground but never flew. The American Dream and the ideals that America is built on is all about success, equality, and the happiness of the people for the people And closest thing to this being made real, being achieved in Duke's lifetime, on the Vegas Strip is with the Bazooko Circus casino owner. Who created his own circus allowing him to make his own American Dream real. Even if it's not the way Duke wanted it to be. The film ends on a bittersweet note by Duke musing on the acid culture of the Hippies and how it screwed them over: physically and spiritually. How Tim Leary, a prominent proponent of LSD-use in the 60s brought about a generation of permanent cripples, failed seekers, who never understood the essential old-mystic fallacy of the acid culture The desperate assumption that somebody or at least some force is tending to the light at the end of the tunnel. Duke and Thompson were and will always be in their own way and based on his writings, we get a movie that reflects this attitude: it\xe2\x80\x99s very unique, it's strange, and mind-bending. It\xe2\x80\x99s sort of a dark comedy that uses techniques that would feel at home in a horror movie. Using weird angles, a wobbling lens, as well as disturbing imagery, and audio manipulation and mechanized sets to disorientate the viewer, and put us in the golf shoes of Raoul Duke and it\xe2\x80\x99s not a film Hollywood would ever cherish, and it only appeals to a niche audience. and if you like the sort of film that's dark, that's weird, and, well, unique. I'd highly suggest that you watch this film and if you've already watched it once, well, watch it again because this film is truly made made for freaks in the freak kingdom.
