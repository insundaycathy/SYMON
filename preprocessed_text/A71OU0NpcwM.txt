Story Recapped here. Today, I'm going to explain an action, adventure, sci-fi film called \xe2\x80\x9cStargate.\xe2\x80\x9d Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care. In a North African settlement in 8,000 B.C., tribespeople are woken up by bright lights and loud humming. A spacecraft descends upon them, and they start running. A young man sees the craft, and without fear or hesitation, he walks up to the alien ship, getting bombarded by bright lights. It is 1928 in Egypt, and an archeologist arrives at a dig site with his daughter. A man welcomes him, excited to show the archeologist the latest dig find. They arrive at a circular tablet formation with hieroglyphs and other strange carvings. As the men examine the carvings, the archeologist\xe2\x80\x99s daughter finds a gold necklace with an Egyptian rune. Nearby, workers are erecting a massive circular structure. The archeologist notes that this is nothing he has ever seen before. In the present day, the archeologist\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, Catherine Langford, is now an older woman making her way to a scientific gathering. At this event, Egyptologist and linguist, Daniel Jackson, presents his claim that the Egyptian pyramids were built at a much earlier date than currently accepted. The audience, finding his theories ridiculous, leaves one by one. Outside, Catherine invites Daniel into her car and offers him a job to decipher ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs on the circular tablets her father found. Catherine tells him that this could be his chance to prove his theories. Military personnel arrive at a suburban home and inform Colonel Jack O\xe2\x80\x99Neill that he is being reactivated to serve in the army. Jack cradles a gun and hides it when the soldiers knock. The soldiers tell him why they came, and he stays quiet. While leaving, one of the men reveals that Jack had lost his young son to an accidental gun discharge. Daniel arrives at a top-secret military installation and sees the circular stone tablet with hieroglyphs. He\xe2\x80\x99s informed that the seven center carvings are yet to be deciphered, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the reason he\xe2\x80\x99s there. Daniel then sees a board with hieroglyph translations, and sees errors. He immediately goes to corrects everything and produces a translation about the sun god, Ra, using a stargate. One of the scientists informs Daniel that they have found a significant artifact in the sands, something dating back 10,000 years, much more ancient than the Egyptians. Jack enters and informs everyone that he now has sole supervision over the entire project. The scientists are confused, and Catherine asks the colonel to clarify. She had the belief that she had complete autonomy over the project, but Jack informs her that the higher-ups have changed their minds. The colonel then adds that his presence is only required if the project achieves its goal. Daniel works on the translation and exhausts all possible language ciphers he knows but still can\xe2\x80\x99t come up with a solid translation. While going for a coffee break, he sees a star constellation and recognizes that one of the seven symbols is shaped similarly. With this discovery, Daniel is called to brief the military heads. He presents his findings and shows that six of the symbols correspond to coordinates for a location, with the seventh symbol indicating a place of origin. One scientist protests, saying the seventh symbol is not on the device they were experimenting on. Daniel asks what device he\xe2\x80\x99s pertaining to, and they open a wall to show Daniel what the project has been centered on. In the next room, the enormous circular hollow stone found in Egypt has been erected and attached to the building\xe2\x80\x99s power. It looks alien in origin and appears to be some sort of portal doorway. Catherine tells Daniel that this is the stargate earlier mentioned in the translation. Catherine explains that the stargate is made of a mineral not present on Earth. A team of scientists inputs the symbols Daniel had discovered. Daniel spots the seventh symbol on the device, and the other scientist concurs. They place the symbols in, and with each symbol locking into place, the room hums and shakes. The scientists lock in the seventh symbol, and the stargate bursts open. A portal appears, and everyone is dumbfounded. They then take a robotic rover equipped with a camera and send it into stargate. As the rover enters, it sends a location in a galaxy on the farthest edges of the known universe. The probe then suddenly loses its signal, but luckily, some footage has been transmitted. From the robot\xe2\x80\x99s readings, they see that there is also a stargate on the opposite side that they assume functions in the same way. Atmospheric readings also indicate that whatever planet the rover has been transported to has the same atmospheric conditions as Earth. The military considers they may have to abort as the project\xe2\x80\x99s primary goal is to perform surveillance. The team that will perform reconnaissance must decipher the markings and access the stargate from the opposite side to get back home. With the information they\xe2\x80\x99ve gathered, they\xe2\x80\x99re uncertain they\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to achieve that. Daniel immediately speaks up and says he may be able to help. The military men take his word and enroll him on the reconnaissance team. As Daniel prepares for the trip, Catherine gives him the necklace she found at the dig site for good luck. The scientists turn the stargate on again, and a group of soldiers enters it one by one. Daniel is the last to enter and, before he does so, stares in awe and excitement at what he\xe2\x80\x99s about to experience. A new world behind the stargate. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be part of one of the first humans ever to enter. He steps in and is immediately transported through millions of miles in a matter of seconds. The team emerges on the other side and gets to work and surveying the area. They step out into what appears to be an old stone temple and see they\xe2\x80\x99re in the middle of a desert. They then see a large stone pyramid dwarfing the temple they exited from. Jack asks Daniel how long it\xe2\x80\x99d take to get the stargate working, but Daniel confesses that he has no idea how to get the machine to work. He assumed that the symbols they\xe2\x80\x99d need for the stargate to work would be readily available. Unlike the stargate back on Earth, he still needs to find the seven symbols required for a trip home. One of the soldiers understandably shouts at Daniel and pushes him, but Jack steps in and orders the man to set up a base camp. Inside the temple, Jack initializes some sort of beeping device with a timer but hides it immediately when one of the soldiers enters. Back outside, Daniel fixes his belongings, and one of the soldiers bullies him, throwing his luggage out, books spewing out. Daniel understands their frustration and gathers his things. In the distance, he sees some kind of animal grazing. He approaches it and tries to pet it. Luckily for him, the animal is tamed and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think of him as a threat. Jack and two other soldiers see him and call out to him. Daniel assures them that the animal is harmless as it\xe2\x80\x99s got a harness, indicating that it\xe2\x80\x99s domesticated. The animal gets startled, and its harness gets tangled with Daniel\xe2\x80\x99s foot. It bolts, and Daniel gets dragged. Jack and the soldiers chase after him, but the animal runs too fast. They finally catch up to Daniel, but Jack spots something over the hill. The soldiers reposition on top of the hill, and they\xe2\x80\x99re all shocked to see a sprawling community of people that look like humans. From what they can see, the location seems to look like a mine. The miners see them, and they all stop. The group starts approaching the miners, and one of the miners sees Daniel\xe2\x80\x99s necklace. He shouts to the other miners, and they all start bowing to Daniel. Jack approaches one of the young men, a teenager, Skaara, and runs to retrieve the village elder. One of Jack\xe2\x80\x99s men takes a reading of the rock they\xe2\x80\x99re mining and sees that it consists of the same material the stargate is made of. The village elder, Kasuf, approaches and welcomes the men. He offers a drink, and Daniel offers a chocolate bar in return. The exchange proves positive, and both parties are on good terms. Jack asks Daniel to translate, but Daniel says he can\xe2\x80\x99t decipher what kind of language they\xe2\x80\x99re speaking. He theorizes it could be a variant of the Egyptian language but is unsure. Jack then radios to the men back at base camp and informs them they\xe2\x80\x99ll be staying a little longer. The whole mining group then travels to a large town, almost a city, made entirely of mud and brick houses. Daniel and the group are welcomed, greeted with hospitality, and are treated as guests of honor. They arrive at a gathering place, and the elder reveals an overhanging brass plate with a symbol. Daniel identifies it as the symbol for the Egyptian sun god, Ra, and Jack realizes the villagers have been welcoming because of the necklace Daniel is wearing, which has the same symbol. An alarm blares, and everyone rushes out. Jack tries radioing base camp, but a massive sandstorm overruns the camp. The city gates are closed, but Jack misunderstands, thinking the villagers are becoming hostile. They take several villagers hostage and fire warning shots. Skaara tries to calm the soldiers down and shows Jack the reason they\xe2\x80\x99re closing the gates. He sees the approaching sandstorm and orders his men to stand down. That evening, the elders and Daniel\xe2\x80\x99s group gather for a feast. Jack theorizes that since the villagers could identify the Egyptian symbol for Ra, then it would stand to reason that they may know more Egyptian symbols, specifically the symbols needed for initiating the stargate. Daniel approaches Kasuf and tries to communicate by drawing something in the sand. Kasuf panics and erases the writing. He then orders everyone out. Daniel guesses that writing of any kind must be forbidden in their culture. Kasuf then orders the women to take Daniel away, and they do so, laughing and teasing Daniel. They take Daniel to a tent, bathe him, and groom him. The women then leave, and a beautiful woman, Sha'uri, enters. She then starts undressing, and Daniel understands what is happening. This woman has been offered to him as an offering. He takes Sha'uri out, but Kasuf sees this and understands this as Daniel rejecting Sha'uri. He falls to his knees and starts apologizing. Upon seeing this, Daniel instead thanks Kasuf for Sha'uri. The two return inside the tent, and Daniel shows Sha'uri a drawing of the pyramid. Sha'uri answers by drawing the symbol for Earth. Daniel asks Sha'uri if she\xe2\x80\x99s seen the symbol somewhere in the city and asks her to take him there. Back in the temple, the soldiers have retreated inside to hide from the sandstorm. They soon start hearing an ominous humming sound, and the temple begins vibrating. Above them, a pyramid-shaped spaceship descends, landing on the massive pyramid. The temple trembles violently, and the soldiers are thrown to the ground. The ship finally lands, and everything becomes calm. The men spread out, sensing something in the temple. One by one, the soldiers start getting picked off by an unseen creature. They get whacked by a blunt instrument with some kind of electricity running through it. One of the soldiers manages to get to a gun, firing at the creature, but he still gets bested. The attacker reveals itself as a human-robot hybrid with the head of a jackal, emulating the Egyptian god Anubis. Back in the village, Jack shows Skaaraa a metal lighter. Skaara is astonished by the small device that can create fire. The two then share a cigarette, but Skaara starts coughing, and Jack laughs. Skaara then comes closer and reaches for Jack\xe2\x80\x99s rifle, to which Jack immediately swipes his hand off and shouts at him. He scolds Skaara, telling him the gun is dangerous. Skaara runs away, frightened. Jack is reminded of his son and the fatal shooting accident. Meanwhile, Jack and Sha'uri enter a cave with hieroglyphs Daniel can recognize. He then uses the inscription to have Sha'uri teach him the language. Already learned in the Egyptian language, Daniel learns quickly. Jack and the soldiers still can\xe2\x80\x99t establish communication with the base camp, and Jack decides to look for Daniel. He asks Skaara and some of his friends where Daniel is, and after a few attempts, Skaara understands Jack. Skaara takes one of the yaks and has it smell Daniel\xe2\x80\x99s jacket. Jack finds Daniel in the cave with Sha'uri, and Daniel tells him what he\xe2\x80\x99s found out. From the hieroglyphs, Daniel speaks of a traveler from distant stars, that being Ra, looking for a way to escape death. Ra escaped his dying world and is one of if not the only remaining descendant of his species. Ra found Earth, where he encountered early humans who worshipped him. He soon realized that a human body would give him a chance for extended life. He found a young boy, abducted him, and placed his mind in the boy\xe2\x80\x99s body. He then used the stargate to bring thousands of humans to the current planet as a massive workforce to mine a mineral. This mineral has unique properties making it suitable as a powerful energy source. A rebellion soon starts on Earth, and Ra\xe2\x80\x99s forces are quickly overrun. He escapes to this planet and, to prevent another uprising, outlaws reading and writing, making the people forget their history. In the cave, they find another stone tablet containing the six symbols required for powering up the stargate. Daniel sees that the seventh symbol is missing and tells them they can\xe2\x80\x99t make the stargate work without it. By dawn, the group decides to return to base camp. A group of boys led by Skaara follows closely. The group arrives at base camp, seeing the massive spaceship. They rush into the temple and see signs of a battle. They notice something stalking them, and they all hide. Anubis once again quickly picks them off one by one. He fires his staff, and an electrical force throws back anyone who gets hit. Soon, only Jack and Daniel remain. They head to the lower section where the stargate is located, and Jack opens the container where he hid the device earlier. He\xe2\x80\x99s surprised to see that Ra had taken the device. Metallic rings descend from the ceiling, and another human-robot hybrid teleports inside them, this time in the form of Horus. Two other guards flank him, and Jack and Daniel surrender. Anubis and Horus take Jack and Daniel to Ra\xe2\x80\x99s throne room and force the two to kneel. Ra appears before all of them, followed by a posse of young boys kept as slaves. Ra shows Jack the device, and Ra says that they had brought the device to destroy him. Daniel identifies it as a bomb and questions Jack\xe2\x80\x99s true objectives on the mission. Ra orders Anubis and Horus to show themselves, and it\xe2\x80\x99s revealed that the two are humans. Ra also takes off his mask and appears as the young boy in the story from the hieroglyphs. Jack takes the opportunity and steals one of the gods\xe2\x80\x99 weapons, and shoots them. Daniel tries to stop the fighting but gets shot, ending up with a hole through his body. Jack aims the weapon at Ra, but the children surround Ra, and Jack hesitates. Jack gets disarmed and beaten, but Ra orders his men to stop. Ra sees Daniel\xe2\x80\x99s necklace and examines it. Jack then gets dumped into a jail cell with his men. Outside the ship, Skaara sees two aircraft launching from the spaceship, heading for the town. Kasuf sees the ships and orders everyone to take cover. The ships rain fire upon the townspeople, punishing them for blasphemy. Horus and Anubis spare no one, firing on men, women, children, and the elderly. Skaara runs back to the town and sees the devastation. Kasuf tells Skaara that entertaining Daniel and the men had been a mistake. In the ship, Daniel wakes up in Ra\xe2\x80\x99s regeneration pod. The same pod Ra uses to maintain his immortality. Daniel sees that the hole on his stomach has healed entirely and heads out, seeing Ra being dressed. Daniel tells Ra that he knows he had died earlier when he got shot. Ra tells him that the human body\xe2\x80\x99s ease of repair is the reason why he chose a human to be his host body. Ra then reveals he intends to send back the bomb to Earth, along with a shipment of the mineral, which would multiply the bomb\xe2\x80\x99s destructive power. Ra adds that he created human civilization, and it would be a fitting end if he\xe2\x80\x99d be the one to destroy it. Ra tells Daniel that Jack and his men would be an example of anyone who wants to defy his rule. Ra orders Daniel to kill Jack and the soldiers in front of the entire town. Ra is concerned that the inhabitants of the planet might start seeing Daniel as another god figure to praise, and tells him there\xe2\x80\x99s only one true god on that planet. Ra yanks the necklace off of Daniel and threatens him that if he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t kill Jack and the men, then Ra would kill him. In the town, Sha'uri tells Skaara and the boys the true history of their people and their origin. The following day, everyone is gathered to witness Daniel killing the soldiers, but Skaara reveals that he and the other boys are ready to fight back. Seeing this, Daniel turns and fires at Ra. A firefight breaks loose, and the crowd disperses. Everyone later regroups at a hidden location and gathers around a bonfire. Jack reveals that his primary mission objective is to identify any potential threats on the other side of the stargate. If a danger exists, he will destroy the stargate using the bomb to prevent an invasion on Earth. Later, Daniel sees Sha\xe2\x80\x99uri, and she tells him she\xe2\x80\x99s okay with being rejected. Upon hearing this, Daniel kisses Sha\xe2\x80\x99uri. Sha\xe2\x80\x99uri then sketches something on the wall. Daniel discovers that this could be the seventh symbol they need to access stargate. That afternoon in the mines, they ambush Horus and disable him. Kasuf tries to stop the rebellion, telling them the gods would punish them, but Daniel reveals to everyone that the gods are mere humans who possess advanced technology. Ra orders guards to send the bomb to Earth, but Skaara and the boys intercept them. The guards check them one by one, and Jack reveals himself, shooting the guards. Another firefight ensues, and casualties fall on both sides. Jack, Daniel, and Sha\xe2\x80\x99uri get trapped inside. The rest of the rebels are stuck outside, left to face the aircrafts raining fire on them. Jack finds the bomb and activates the timer, deciding to remain on the planet to destroy the stargate as the team returns to Earth. A guard appears behind them and shoots Sha\xe2\x80\x99uri dead. Jack kills the guard, but Anubis appears via the teleportation rings. Daniel takes Sha\xe2\x80\x99uri to the regeneration pod. Jack is left alone to face Anubis, and they exchange blows, the two fairly matched. Outside, the soldiers and the boys are trying their best to battle the aircraft but soon run out of ammo. One of the soldiers decides to surrender and orders everyone to do the same. The aircrafts land and the pilots approach them. Daniel succeeds in healing Sha\xe2\x80\x99uri, taking her out of the chamber and bringing her back to the teleportation machine. Ra sees them and catches Daniel before he teleports. Ra grabs Daniel\xe2\x80\x99s head and uses alien powers to melt Daniel\xe2\x80\x99s brain. In the stargate room, Jack somehow gets the upper hand and pins Anubis to the floor. He activates the teleportation rings, and the rings descend on Anubis\xe2\x80\x99 head. At the same time, the rings activate on Daniel and Ra\xe2\x80\x99s side, distracting Ra, making him let go of Daniel. Daniel is quick to grab the necklace back. He and Sha\xe2\x80\x99uri teleport back, and Anubis\xe2\x80\x99 head appears in front of Ra. The pilots are about to execute Skaara, the boys, and the soldiers, but Kasuf appears with the entire townspeople rallying behind him. They all charge the pilots and quickly overwhelm them. Seeing this, Ra decides to relaunch his ship. Ra leaves, and Jack no longer needs the bomb. But Jack discovers that he can\xe2\x80\x99t stop the timer anymore. With seconds left on the clock, they decide to send the bomb to Ra\xe2\x80\x99s ship using the teleportation rings. As Ra\xe2\x80\x99s ship exits the planet\xe2\x80\x99s atmosphere, the bomb appears in front of Ra, and he\xe2\x80\x99s astonished to see it. Ra freezes, unable to react to the bomb as it explodes. The ship explodes with an incredible amount of force, and everyone back on the surface cheers. The team then prepares to return to Earth. Daniel decides he wants to remain on the planet, starting a new life with his newly beloved Sha\xe2\x80\x99uri. He gives the necklace back to Jack before he steps into the void beyond the stargate.
