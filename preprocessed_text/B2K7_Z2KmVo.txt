Lee was tripped over by a body, Fortunately, a man behind pulled him, He luckily avoid the detection, There were only seconds left, Lee ran and finally cross the line at the last moment, And the other people would be eliminated, suddenly, a huge lawn began to close, It turned out that they were taken to an island, After the first level, There were only 201 people left, Everyone panicked at such a cruel game, A lot of people knelt down and begged, but the red man said if everyone could abide the rules of the game, they would get the prizes as promised, However, they wanted to quit, The red man cautioned everyone according to the second terms of the contract, participants who refused to play the game would be eliminated, At that time, the man in glasses thought of the third terms which allowed the game to be interrupted if a majority agree, The red man agreed to let them vote on their choice, But before that, they announced the prize money earned in the first level, Based on the calculation, the prize was 25,5 billion, If they quit now, the prize will be distributed evenly to the families of the eliminated people, Lee was the first to start voting, His purpose was to earn money, he will not give up on this, so he chose to continue the game, The next vote is basically a half-half, Some people chose to face the debt outside, while others wanted to have their back against the wall, There was only an old man left, the vote was 100 to 100, The old man hesitated for a moment, Finally, he chose to continue the game, The voting result was 100 to 101, They needed to play the game which was crueler, 201 people were sent to a place to participate in another death game, they choose a graphic first, There were circles, triangles, stars, umbrellas, After choosing a figure, each person was given a box, which contained a piece of toffee and a pin, it was the game of toffee, If the graphics broke, they would be eliminated, They must take out the full graphics in ten minutes, Lee, chose the most complicated shape \xe2\x80\x94 an umbrella sadly, The game began, Everyone was lying on the ground, carefully carving graphics, They were scared by every movement they made, Also, there were a lot of red men patrolling around with guns, Once finding that someone broke the graphic, the red men would shoot them, no matter how they beg for mercy, In the panic, a woman accidentally broke it, With no surprise, she was also eliminated, Afterward, more and more people were eliminated, A woman had a lighter which came from nowhere, The heated pin did help, With a gunshot, a man who had chosen the triangle was the first to remove the graphic fully, Another person succeeded, It seems that the triangle was the easiest to complete, A black man also took out the circle carefully, Those who chose the triangle and the circle passed the game one by one, At this point, LEE was sweating, wetting the needle with saliva, There were only three minutes left in the game, Lee sweated a lot, Suddenly, he seems to find something, He took the toffee towards the sun, finding that it melted slowly, then starting to lick the toffee, After a while, the umbrella-shaped seam became more obvious, Some of those who chose the pentagram completed the game as well, Those who didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do started to follow Lee to lick the toffee, There was one minute left, The rest of the people looked like dogs, who kept licking, The situation made the red men confused, Now it\xe2\x80\x99s the time to witness miracles, A complete umbrella was taken out, Time's up and the game ended, Those who didn't finish would all be killed, A man can\xe2\x80\x99t accept the result hijacked a red man, he was just a young child, The man could not bear to kill the child but decided to kill himself, However, once the red man reveals his identity, he will not survive either, The next thing was The prize money they won in the second level is 7,9 billion, With two levels of the game, the total prize money is now 34,8 billion, which means that 348 people died, The horror thing was far more than just the game, For those who died in a fight inside, that will also increase the prize for them, To stay alive there, they have to form their own squad, On the 100-meter high platform, the losing side of the tug-of-war would be hung in the air and then be cut off from the rope before falling into mush, Ten people formed a group, They can choose their teammates, Then, The first game is group seven versus group two, The chains on their hands back locked tightly on the rope, With a gunshot, the game began, The two sides desperately pull back, team one was formed by ten strong men while there were two girls in team seven, Obviously, there was a power difference, People in team seven fell on the ground and then were hung in the air, Those ten people all fell into the mush, the second match, Lee's team four versus team five, The situation can\xe2\x80\x99t get worse this time, Lee's team had an old men, and also three girls, in contrast, group five had ten strong men, Were they doomed to lose? the old man said that tug of war does not rely only on strength, He let some people stand at the left, the rest at the right side, Then, clamp the rope under the armpits, The most critical part is to lean back the body after the game start, Make the lower abdomen towards the sky and head tilted back, Use all the strength to pull the rope, but don\xe2\x80\x99t move the feet, waiting for the other side to confuse themselves and reveal a breach, Both teams were formed temporarily, Although they were much weaker, they were more united, They shouted a slogan immediately after the first 10 seconds when the other team was tired, 1,2,1,2, pull, The other team could not resist and was pulled to the edge a few times, However, The strong team immediately stabilized, team four was right away pulled back, Seeing they were about to lose, one man shouted \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s run three steps forward\xe2\x80\x9d Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that insane? He hissed and explained that this can make the other team fall, they move forward together, Lee was hung in the air, The other team really all fell down, Lee team took the only chance, they pull the rope hard, Just in a few seconds, they hung up all of their opponents all the way, They felt like just came back from the hell, After some rounds over, only 40 people left, the prize reached 41,6 billion, As long as the rules inside are violated, regardless of who you are, you will be hung up like salami, half of the people had been eliminated, In the coming level, they will be in a group of two people, what would be the next?
