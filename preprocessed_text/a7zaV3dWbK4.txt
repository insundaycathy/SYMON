Hey what's up, guys? Explanation pro is here. Today I'll explain a Horror/comedy horror film. Title PEE MAK. Spoilers incoming. The film opens in a small house, where the pregnant Nak falls to the ground, calling his husband\xe2\x80\x99s name, Pee Mak. The film then transitions to a medic, Ter, grimly telling his comrades about his experience. As a result, he gets slapped in the head by a man with a stupid-looking hairdo, Puak. Mak then is brought to the room, screaming in pain, only to find out that it\xe2\x80\x99s just a sprain. Puak encourages them never to surrender, telling them that they still have swords to fight against the enemy. As they courageously charge, they forget that the enemies have guns. In the trenches, Mak tells his new friends that they will not die there because he still wants to see his wife and child. Because of this, they carried on to battle, with Mak getting shot every time. While this is happening, Nak hauntingly sings for her husband, making the townspeople lock themselves in their houses. She must be a bad singer. Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you know it, the gang survives the war. Afterward, Mak returns in a boat to Phra Khanong while being accompanied by his friends. Upon reaching the town, all they see are empty houses. They then continue toward Mak\xe2\x80\x99s house, and they reach the place by nightfall. Mak calls Nak, but he receives no reply. Mak then sees a rocking baby\xe2\x80\x99s crib, but he finds it empty upon inspection. Suddenly, Nak hugs him from behind. They then joyfully kiss and embrace each other. Mak then sees his son, with Nak informing him that she named the child after his favourite name. Upon shouting the name, the gang gets disappointed by how ugly the name is, with Puak commenting that his servant has a nicer name. Afterward, Mak introduces his wife to his friends in order: Aey, Ter, Puak, and Shin. After learning that his friends have to stay for one night because it is already too late to leave, Mak implores them to stay for much longer than that. Mak then points them to his aunt\xe2\x80\x99s old house across the river, telling them to stay there for a while. That night, Mak tells Nak that she is all he thought about during the war. After Nak scares him by pointing out that there is a ghost, Mak immediately tells Nak that he\xe2\x80\x99s afraid of ghosts, which somehow makes Nak sad. After talking to each other, Nak proceeds to rock the baby while singing a haunting lullaby that echoes throughout, inducing the townspeople with fear. The following day, Puak is rudely awakened by Shin imitating the chirping of birds. Mak then shouts at them from outside, telling them that they have to go to the market. Ter and Mak then see a boat carrying dead bodies from the war. While rowing a boat toward the town, Shin waves at Nak, who is by the window. But Nak just ominously stares, making Shin uncomfortable. When they reach the town, they find the market is crowded. Mak then approaches a street vendor that he knows, but the street vendor immediately hides what she\xe2\x80\x99s selling, telling Mak that she\xe2\x80\x99s all out. This happens again with another vendor, who tells Mak that he\xe2\x80\x99s not selling fish because it\xe2\x80\x99s a holy day. In the liquor store, Mak talks to the dozing vendor. However, realizing that the boy is Mak, the vendor suddenly tells Mak that he should look under and between his legs to see what Nak is. But she is interrupted by a boy named Ping, who tells the gang that she speaks nonsense when drunk. That night, while drinking, the four boys talk about the strange happenings earlier. Shin then tells them that when he was a child, his mom would tell her that one can see a ghost by looking between the legs. Ter then asks her if he implies that Nak is a ghost, and when Shin nods, the other three laugh at him. They then command Shin to invite Mak to their drinking session, and Shin has no choice but to accept because he\xe2\x80\x99s that least drunk. While Shin is climbing the stairs to Mak\xe2\x80\x99s house, one of the steps breaks. He sees Nak, asking her if Mak is there. He then feels relief because Nak talks to him normally. However, Nak begins to bleed from between her legs, ending with a nightmarish drop of a fetus. Shin suddenly wakes up from this bad dream. But he soon finds out that it is a case of d\xc3\xa9j\xc3\xa0 vu. After being commanded again to go to Mak\xe2\x80\x99s house, Shin goes again and climbs the stairs. Knowing one of the steps is going to break, he crosses beyond it, but the next step breaks instead. After getting up to the house, he finds the whole house untidy. After seeing the crib move by itself and seeing Nak\xe2\x80\x99s hand reaching a lime below the house even if she\xe2\x80\x99s upstairs, Shin leaves the scene immediately to return to his buddies. Aey, Ter, and Puak drunkenly sing and dance their marching song. Shin then arrives to tell them that Nak is a ghost, stating that the house is messy, the crib moved on its own, and Nak inhumanly reaches a lime with a long arm. But all of this is countered by Shin\xe2\x80\x99s friends as imaginations. The following day, the gang helps Mak because the townspeople all act strange. Ter is then assigned to take the axe inside the house. Upon climbing the stairs, Ter sees that Shin was correct in saying that the house is untidy. He then attempts to look between his legs, but instead, he wrongly looks at Nak\xe2\x80\x99s legs. Ter then tells Shin that he made the ghost-identifying move but finds nothing. Afterward, Ter takes a dump in the forest. There, he sees a mummified corpse wearing a ring, making him run. In his run, he knocks over a bee\xe2\x80\x99s nest, and when he returns, Shin and Aey see his bloated face from bee stings. Ter then sees Nak wearing the same ring that the corpse had, finally concluding that Nak is indeed a ghost. He tries to warn his friends, but they cannot understand him because his face is bloated. Ter then writes what he\xe2\x80\x99s saying. After giving it to the gang, they are understandably surprised. It rains afterward, and Mak sees his friends outside his house. After seeing the paper that Puak is holding, Mak approaches them to know what it is about. After attempting to pass it from one person to another, Mak finally reads it, getting shocked as well. The four then immediately leave Mak to return to the guest house. There, Shin asks Ter why he did not see Nak as a ghost when he looked between the legs, and Ter answers that he looked at Nak\xe2\x80\x99s legs, not knowing that he is supposed to look between his legs. They then witness through the window how Mak confronts Nak. However, Mak embraces Nak, confusing the gang. Ter then understands that Mak misread what is written because the ink has been smudged by the rain, reading it as \xe2\x80\x9cgross\xe2\x80\x9d instead of \xe2\x80\x9cghost\xe2\x80\x9d. While the others have made up their mind to leave, Ter does not want to abandon Mak. That night, Ter and Shin decide to go to Mak to tell him about Nak, leaving Aey and Puak behind. Aey and Puak then are approached by Ping, telling them to help him slaughter his cow as a funeral offering. When they learned that it was for Ping\xe2\x80\x99s mother and that his mother died because she attempted to reveal Nak\xe2\x80\x99s identity, Aey and Puak immediately followed their friends to warn them. Ter is about to tell Mak that his wife is a ghost, but he changes it instead to \xe2\x80\x9cbeautiful\xe2\x80\x9d after seeing Nak. Aey and Puak arrive with wet clothes, implying that they crossed the river without a boat. As they are about to return to their house, Nak suggests eating at Mak\xe2\x80\x99s residence. Afterward, upon seeing the disgusting food, the four tell Mak that they are full. Ter, however, eats because he sees Nak\xe2\x80\x99s deadly stare as if to say the food is to die for. After Ter eats a dry leaf, the rest eat as well, with poor Shin having to eat the worms. Afterward, Mak then invites them to hold his child, with Shin unluckily chosen again. After noticing that the four are signalling each other, Mak wrongly thought they were thinking about playing charades. While playing charades, Mak always answers with far-fetched guesses, prompting Ter to wonder what Mak\xe2\x80\x99s IQ is. When it is Ter\xe2\x80\x99s turn, the word he has to make them guess for is \xe2\x80\x9cdesert\xe2\x80\x9d. They then quickly get the second syllable with the word \xe2\x80\x9cshirt\xe2\x80\x9d. When they can\xe2\x80\x99t get the first syllable, Ter points at Nak and Shin immediately connects the two syllables \xe2\x80\x9cdead\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cshirt\xe2\x80\x9d to form \xe2\x80\x9cdesert\xe2\x80\x9d. They celebrate only briefly when they realize that they revealed Nak is dead. They then make excuses to leave after Mak asks them what the answer is. While trying hard to go back to their house via a boat, the boat briefly circles back twice due to their anxiety-filled rowing before finally returning on track. Mak confronts the four in their house, telling them that Ping lied to the villagers about his wife being a ghost because Nak rejected Ping\xe2\x80\x99s courtship. Mak returns to his house, telling Nak that he already kicked out his friends. Afterward, Mak and Nak then go to a carnival, with Nak wearing a mask to hide her identity. They then have fun together. Nak helps Mak win a \xe2\x80\x9cknock the cans\xe2\x80\x9d game and remove the Ferris wheel queue by using her ghostly powers. While aboard the Ferris wheel, Nak asks her husband if he can live without her, and Mak answers that he can\xe2\x80\x99t. Afterward, the couple enters the haunted house, while Ter, Puak, and Shin observe from afar. Ter then tells them that he brought holy rice. Inside the haunted house, the four kidnap Mak behind Nak\xe2\x80\x99s back. However, upon finding out that the door is stuck, the four change as the haunted house\xe2\x80\x99s monsters, with Ter placing his foot on Mak\xe2\x80\x99s mouth. After Nak leaves, the four move again to leave the place, but they reencounter Nak, with Nak reaching Ter with her elongated arm. They then break through the walls to escape to the forest. In the forest, the four let go of Mak. Mak then admonishes them for doing this, telling them that the arm they saw earlier is just a prop. After telling them that he tried the \xe2\x80\x9clooking between the legs\xe2\x80\x9d method and saw nothing, Mak leaves them. The gang attempts to follow Mak but cannot find him. They then see a trail of blood which leads to Mak. Mak\xe2\x80\x99s war wound has opened again, leading Ter to think that Mak might be the ghost. Ter and Shin then take Mak\xe2\x80\x99s hand to see if he has the wedding ring, and upon finding nothing, they feel relieved. However, when Mak shows that his ring is in his necklace, Ter immediately throws the holy rice at Mak, making Mak scream in pain. The four then flee from the area. After stopping their run, the four then talk about Nak actually being the living one. They then agree to save Nak from Mak rather than leaving her alone with the dead. Returning to Nak\xe2\x80\x99s house, Puak calls Nak, telling her that she must go with them. The sceptical Shin is still afraid of her, telling them about the food earlier, and Puak justifies it as just healthy options. After Nak searches for Mak, the gang makes up an excuse that Mak is somewhere else. They then leave on a boat. In the next scene, the boat starts to sink, so they have to throw their belongings away. Puak stupidly asks Nak if her son is necessary, and he receives silence as an answer. Ter then has the bright idea to throw the paddles away, and the boat stops sinking after that, resulting in a celebration. But now they can\xe2\x80\x99t move. Suddenly, Mak appears on the shore, scaring the four idiots. Mak then swims toward them, but he gets a muscle cramp and begins to drown. They then help Mak get out of the water. Mak then admonishes them for leaving him. Ter asks why Mak screamed in pain when the holy rice was thrown at him, and Mak answers that the rice struck his wound. The boat starts sinking again, prompting Puak to ask Nak again if her son is still necessary. They then paddle with their hands. Ter stops them, asking about the real ghost. After Aey drops the wedding ring, Ter screams that Aey is the ghost, kicking Aey from the boat. After pointlessly paddling with their hands, Nak gives them a paddle. Ter stops from his track after realizing that the paddle is so far now, which means Nak is the ghost. Ter then stands to look between his legs, but all he sees is his friends\xe2\x80\x99 faces. After failing to get their heads out of the way, Ter smartly sings their marching song, which the others follow. After the song is done, Ter finally sees Nak\xe2\x80\x99s ghostly face. Nak then reaches Mak with her elongated arm, prompting them to leave the boat. However, not knowing how to swim, Shin does not jump, leaving him behind with Nak. But after Nak holds his head, Shin jumps to the water and expertly swims to the shore. They then knock out Mak because he does not want to leave his wife. Inside a temple, Puak, Ter, Shin, and a knocked out Mak are surrounded by strings while a monk is praying beside them. Nak enters the temple, but the monk is not afraid because he has weapons such as holy water, holy rice, and their strings. However, because of the rowdy boys, the holy water is spilled, the holy rice is fed to the birds, and the string gets broken after the monk is kicked toward it. Afterward, the gang find themselves tied to the same strings that are supposed to protect them; the monk escapes immediately through a window. As Nak approaches them, Aey reappears as well. They then push Puak toward Aey because he\xe2\x80\x99s still wet from the holy water, resulting in not one but two kisses from Puak and Aey. Aey then tells them he\xe2\x80\x99s not a ghost, that he got the ring because he is broke. They then attempt to escape Nak, making Nak scream. After disappearing out of sight, they find Nak again, but she is hanging on the roof like Spiderman this time. Nak then tells them that she did not kill Ping\xe2\x80\x99s drunkard mother, who falls down the river on her own. But the gang tells her that she is still selfish because she should have been on the other side. Because of this, Nak reaches out to Mak by stretching her arm. Mak anticipates the arm, but he closes his eyes in fear. Because of this, Nak realizes that Mak is afraid of her. She apologizes to Mak for lying to him, telling him that she only wants to be with him for much longer. Nak then tells Mak that she wants him to carry on after she\xe2\x80\x99s gone. However, Mak tells Nak that he knows she\xe2\x80\x99s a ghost all along, but he decides to continue loving her despite this realization. After Nak tells him that their supernatural relationship is wrong, Mak tells her that while he is afraid of ghosts, he is more afraid of her absence. Because of this, the gang is moved to tears. The film ends with Mak and Nak sharing a passionate kiss. The post-credit scenes show them living with Nak despite being a ghost.
