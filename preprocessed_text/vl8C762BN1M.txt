Welcome to Cinema Summary, ladies and gentlemen. Throughout human history things have changed and yet somehow the same story repeats, again and again. With 6 characters, and 6 stories, Cloud Atlas is a very challenging film to tackle. And because of that, this video will be structured a little bit differently: First, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to summarize every main character\xe2\x80\x99s story very quickly and very briefly. Followed by a section dedicated to explaining things and analyzing aspects of the movie. You can find timestamps down below and on-screen right now. And with that out of the way, come with me on a voyage from the early Age of Sail to the distant shorts of a far off future. This is Cloud Atlas. We first follow Adam Ewing, in 1849. He\xe2\x80\x99s a lawyer working for his father-in-law who owns and uses slaves and, and one day while visiting a plantation, he hears a mysterious noise, and he tracks the sound long enough to come face to face with a slave getting whipped And as soon as he makes eye contact with the slave, Adam collapses. Turns out, Adam\xe2\x80\x99s got a case of parasitic worms and he\xe2\x80\x99s being treated by Dr. Goose, a very shady and unscrupulous man And as he is being given a checkup, we find out that Adam has a birthmark in the shape of a star Something important to the film and something I will elaborate on later. And we then follow Adam, as he's heading back home on a ship quarantined and kept separate  from the rest of the crew and he spends his time writing in a diary about his experience aboard the ship during which he encounters Autua The same slave he saw getting whipped earlier, who stowed away on the same ship that Adam is now on. And somehow they become friends over something very simple: Autua believes that you can become friends with anyone with anyone as long as you look them in the eye. But its implied its because they are both outcasts, in their own way Autua being a slave and Adam being being quarantined and kept separate from the rest of the crew Later, we find out that Dr. Goose is poisoning Adam to steal his stuff, and ultimately, Autua catches him trying to kill Adam and together with Adam\xe2\x80\x99s help they kill Dr. Goose. And when Adam finally gets back home to San Francisco He\xe2\x80\x99s welcomed back by his wife, Tilda; and Adam intentionally goes to his boss, his father-in-law, and burns a slave contract and tells him that he and his wife, will be freeing slaves from now on. Adam, cannot in good conscience work for someone who buys and owns slaves To which his father in law thinks he\xe2\x80\x99s stupid. It's a foolish idea, it'll be just  a drop in the ocean. It'll mean nothing! But Adam sees it differently, even if freeing one slave is like a drop in the ocean. It'll be worth it in the end And the last thing, we see is him leaving with Tilda, hand in hand And that's the end of the first story \xe2\x80\x9cNow what is an ocean but a multitude of drops?\xe2\x80\x9d This line along with Adam\xe2\x80\x99s story is the thesis statement of this film. It sets up the themes, motifs, and concepts that will be explored throughout this movie Themes of human nature, of love, reincarnation, society, oppression, and connections we have with each other and the world around us. All explored in 6 different periods of human history, in 6 stories Then we follow Robert Frobischer, in 1936 who just like Adam has a star shaped birthmark. Now his story is told through a series of letters that he sends to his lover, Rufus Sixsmith. And in them, Robert tells Rufus about his life working as the amanuensis of Vyvyan Ayrs, a very famous composer who lives in Edinburgh While working for Vyvyan in Edinburgh, he finds a journal detailing Adam Ewing\xe2\x80\x99s adventures at sea (the previous story), and he feels inspired enough to write his own composition: The Cloud Atlas Sextet. But one night, Vyvyan comes downstairs and approaches Robert and tells him about his dream that he had, In the dream he heard this amazing song that he had never heard of before being played in a restaurant where all the waitresses had the same face and although he can\xe2\x80\x99t remember the song. And it\xe2\x80\x99s implied that the song Vyvyan heard in his dream, was the one Robert was composing. because Robert was playing it in the middle of the night Ultimately what happens is that, Robert and Vyvyan have a fight over the rights of the song, the Cloud Atlas Sextet From there, the fight gets serious and Vyvyan threatens to ruin Robert\xe2\x80\x99s reputation by exposing him as a homosexual, and Robert ends up shooting Vyvyan and fleeing the house. Now a fugitive on the run, Robert hides in a hotel where he finishes composing The Cloud Atlas Sextet And when he\xe2\x80\x99s done, he kills himself, believing that death is not the end and that he\xe2\x80\x99ll reunite with Rufus in another life. Minutes before Rufus gets to the hotel and finds Robert's dead body in the bathtub, reuniting with him, one final time. Just not in the way he wanted to And so ends his story Now, Robert Frobischer's story and the Cloud Atlas Sextet is Important because they reinforce the theme of connection in ways both Physical, mental, ideological, psychological, fundamental and of course, spiritual And we see this very clearly in the 6 main characters all of whom have the same star shaped birthmark somewhere on their body Which denotes them as a main character but also connects them for a very special reason that I will explain later. Which brings me to the Cloud Atlas Sextet which is a musical composition meant to be played by 6 musicians. And we have six stories with six characters in them being played by six actors. A very obvious connection, right then and there. But did you notice throughout every single story, there is a callback to a previous character. Robert finds a book about Adam\xe2\x80\x99s voyage back home to San Francisco in Vyvyan\xe2\x80\x99s mansion and then later, his own letters and sextet, is listened to and read by Luisa Rey Who just so happens to be our next story. Then we follow, journalist Luisa Rey, in 1973, San Francisco. Who meets Rufus Sixsmith in an elevator and he notices that she also has a star shaped birthmark. Just like Adam and just like Robert. Later, in his hotel room, we find out that Rufus is now a nuclear physicist, who wrote a very important report on a nuclear power plant. And he calls Luisa to get her to leak the report however, he\xe2\x80\x99s assassinated, his murder is framed a suicide and the hitman takes the report. So when Luisa gets there, she finds Rufus's dead body on the bed his letters left there and after reading the letters She finds out about the Cloud Atlas Sextet So the next day, she goes to a record store to find a copy of the song and we briefly meet a guy who looks very familiar and they both muse that the music that\xe2\x80\x99s playing in the store, is the Cloud Atlas Sextet, and it's crazy but it sounds familiar for both them But I think I heard this before even though this is the first time, Luisa\xe2\x80\x99s ever heard it. From there we follow Luisa as she investigates Rufus\xe2\x80\x99s mysterious death, investigating the powerplant, where she meets Isaac Sachs, a fellow nuclear physicist who gives her a copy of Rufus\xe2\x80\x99s report and later as she drives off and he gets on a plane. His plane blows up and shes knocked off a bridge by the same hitman who killed Rufus. with the report sinking to the bottom of the bay. Later, she meets Joe, a friend of her father and a security consultant at the powerplant, who tells her about a conspiracy by Big Oil to make the nuclear powerplant fail so that the oil companies can be more profitable, and this conspiracy is being led by Lloyd Hooks, the guy running the Swannekke Island Nuclear Power Plant From there, Luisa and Joe lure out the hitman and try to kill him, but fail and so they are chased throughout San Francisco, hiding, ducking, weaving, and bobbing and dodging until finally a random woman kills the hitman. Now, that they are safe, they are able to contact Rufus\xe2\x80\x99s niece who just so happens to have a copy of the report that she gives to Luisa who in turn publishes it, exposing the conspiracy and the power plant scandal. And so ends her story Now, Luisa's story is important because it explicitly mentions "Reincarnation". Which is the idea that after you die, instead of going to the afterlife, your soul is reborn into a new body on Earth. In a new, physical incarnation. Which explains why all the main characters all have the same birthmark on their bodies They are a reincarnation of each other and potentially, a reincarnation of Adam. So this idea of reincarnation is backed up and alluded to in many different ways throughout the film And specifically in Luisa\xe2\x80\x99s story, after she listens to the Cloud Atlas Sextet she says that its familiar to her even though it\xe2\x80\x99s the first time she ever heard it. Which is very interesting because this implies that the soul that is reincarnating again and again is able to remember information from other incarnations Even if it's in a different body, regardless of time and space Then we follow Tim Cavendish in 2012, who while attending a award party for publishers and writers Is accompanied by Dermot Hoggins, whose book he published and whose book utterly failed after getting a scathing critique from the critic, Felix Finch and one thing leads to another and Dermot throws Felix off of the building This causes Dermot\xe2\x80\x99s book, Knuckle Sandwich, to sell like hotcakes and Tim makes a lot of money from this But the problem comes in when after he spends all this money, Dermot\xe2\x80\x99s brothers come in and demand 50,000 pounds by tomorrow. Money that Tim doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have, so Tim calls his brother for help who although doesn\xe2\x80\x99t give him money, tells him that knows a place where Tim can hide: Aurora House. So, Tim goes there, but not before visiting the home of his old flame and remembering the time that he lost virginity which although sounds completely random is very important because we find out that he has a star shaped birthmark as well just like the other characters. and when he checks into Aurora House, he wakes up the next morning to find out that it\xe2\x80\x99s not a hotel, it\xe2\x80\x99s actually a nursing home and now Tim is stuck there. A prisoner, perhaps, forever! But with the help of a few friends, he is able to escape, managing to get away from the \xe2\x80\x98evil' Nurse Noakes and Tim is free to write up a memoir about his time at Aurora House, and reunites with his old flame in the process and so ends his story Now, Tim\xe2\x80\x99s story introduces an idea that is heavily associated with reincarnation and that is: Karma. Which is this idea that if you do good things and do bad things you will have good luck and bad luck, accordingly. But this only happens to you in your next life Which is very interesting because all the previous incarnations of Tim have been shown to be very selfish and, well, kind of cruel and manipulative like the sea captain in Adam's story and Vyvyan Ayrs in Robert's. and it seems like in this lifetime, Tim is being punished for all the crimes of his past incarnations being mistreated and abused at the hands of Nurse Noakes at Aurora House, and yet he finds a light within himself, he's able to escape with the help of a few friends and in doing so, proves that we can overcome our innate desires We are not shackled by the sins of our past, and we can move forward, forging a better future for ourselves conquering our innermost desires, no matter how cruel or selfish they may be. Becoming better people in the process In the future of Neo-Soul, 2144, a city half sunk underneath a rising sea level. We follow Sonmi-451, a \xe2\x80\x9cfabricant\xe2\x80\x9d, a clone made to be slaves for the upper class. She specifically is a waitress at a cafe. Her story is retold as part of an interrogation by Archivist Park, before her execution. You see, as a Fabricant, there's only 1 thing she wants, most in life to be "exalted". But after a fellow clone, Yoona-939 who shows her a clip of a movie based off of Tim Cavendish\xe2\x80\x99s life she feels inspired. Inspired to change society. Inspired to defend herself But after an incident in the cafe, Yoona is killed after trying to escape and one day Sonmi wakes up one day to find Hae-Joo, a member of the Rebellion at her cafe who takes her away to the world outside her restaurant. Welcome to Neo-Seoul And it's the first time she's ever been outside of it and it's amazing And he takes her to a hotel where she\xe2\x80\x99s educated on a variety of topics, where she\xe2\x80\x99s given a choice to choose for herself, where she realizes that she\xe2\x80\x99s more than just an expendable clone. She\xe2\x80\x99s a person with rights, with feelings. Then the cops bust in, and Sonmi tries to escape with Hae-Joo who falls and she's captured by the police only to be rescued by Hae-Joo who brings her to meet the rebelloin leader who asks her to join the rebellion. She agrees to be figurehead of the rebellion, the face of the rebellion after seeing what happens to Fabricants who get exalted they are executed and turned into Soap\xe2\x80\x93Fabricant Food. So she\xe2\x80\x99s taken to a relay station where she transmits a message, as the police begin killing the rebels, including Hae-Joo, and ultimately they end up capturing Sonmi. And she is interrogated by Archivist Park, she's says something that leaves him shocked I believe death is only a door, one closes and another opens and if were to imagine heaven, I would imagine a door opening and he would be waiting for me there and it's after this that she's taken to be executed and so ends her story Now, Sonmi\xe2\x80\x99s story deals with themes of oppression, society, reincarnation and love. That last thing she says to Archivist Park, before she's taken to be executed heavily implies that one of the reasons why the souls are reincarnating is due to their \xe2\x80\x98love\xe2\x80\x99 for their soul mate It's implied that Adam's soul has such a powerful love for Tilda, that he's able to reincarnate across human history. Latching onto different bodies, again and again All in the hopes of reuniting with Tilda meaning that Adam's love didn't die with his body. Now going back to oppression and society, in every single story there's at least 1 or 2 bad guys, who represent the most wicked parts of that times society who are usually power hungry or greedy, or even representative of dark desires But in every single story, we have our main characters who find a cause worth living for A cause worth fighting for, like: Truth, Justice, Freedom, Equality, Survival or even Love And in doing so, they are able to triumph over evil. Creating a better world for themselves and for future generations We then follow Zachry, in the year 2311, a tortured soul guilty over the death of his brother-in-law and his nephew. He was too scared to save them from the cannibalistic Kona tribesmen and is now haunted by a demon called Old Georgie. Although whether it\xe2\x80\x99s just a hallucination or if its real is left in the air. Now it's sometime after his village is visited by a Prescient named Meronym \xe2\x80\x93 Prescient\xe2\x80\x99s being humans who are able to use advanced technology \xe2\x80\x93 Catkin, his niece gets sick from radiation with a tumor growing on her foot he strikes a deal with Meronym: He\xe2\x80\x99ll help her get to the top of a mountain, IF she heals Catkin. After healing Catkin, they set off on a journey, all the while Old Georgie haunts Zachry. They manage to get the mountain where a transway station is built \xe2\x80\x93 a building from Sonmi\xe2\x80\x99s story \xe2\x80\x93 and Meronym uses it to broadcast an emergency message to the human colonies in space, asking them to rescue them. With that done, they go back home, only to find Zachry\xe2\x80\x99s village under attack by the Kona, and after rescuing Catkin, Zach goes on the run and gets into a fight with the Kona only to be saved by Meronym. and ultimately, Zach and Meronym along with Catkin decide to go to the outer space colonies together, and years later, he tells his grandchildren the story of how he met Meronym. And we then see that he has a star shaped birthmark on the back of his head. And so ends his story Now if Adam\xe2\x80\x99s story was a thesis statement, Zachry\xe2\x80\x99s story is the conclusion. It's takes all the themes and ideas that this movie explores and ties it up with a nice little bow Because the setup of Zachry\xe2\x80\x99s story is that he\xe2\x80\x99s telling the tale of how he met his wife, Meronym, to his grandchildren. his story is literally about his story and history is the story of Mankind. It is a celebration and condemnation of all human acts of our mistakes and our failures, of our successes and our victories It acknowledges that we are able to triumph in the face of adversity, and even in the darkness moments of our lives we can find light And that is what Cloud Atlas is all about: it acknowledges that we are able to do good and why we should do good. It says that we should be aware of the impact we have on ourselves, on the world around us, and of course on future generations and that we should not be afraid of death, because in our own ways we shall be immortalized forever. With our words, lives, and our stories, being passed down from generation to generation, as a lesson for them to learn so that they can forge a better future for themselves and that is something worth fighting for With that being said, thank you so much for watching, ladies &amp; gentlemen.
