Welcome to Slash Forward. In this episode we\xe2\x80\x99re going to go around and around while attempting to avoid getting our minds wrapped up. But, not in a circle, in a cube you see? As we take a spirited jaunt through the 1997 film Cube. Imagine waking up in a strange room with doors on every wall. Unbeknownst to you, some of those doors lead to adjacent rooms that contain deadly traps. However, it\xe2\x80\x99s not random, they are identified by a complex number system. Sure, you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be able to figure it out, but would one of the other survivors you happened to stumble across along the way? Would you have the time and wherewithal to sort things out to determine everyone\xe2\x80\x99s special talents? Would those talents have anything to do with why each person was selected and placed inside the device? Man, I\xe2\x80\x99m really not sure about that. But I am sure that, along the way, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have a few laughs and, just maybe, learn a few lessons. Be sure to comment with your best idea for how to navigate this labyrinthine hellscape, and hit the like button if, in the process of pondering it, you learn something about yourself. Let\xe2\x80\x99s get to it. We open, unsettlingly, on the closest close up of an eyeball that\xe2\x80\x99s possible with modern technology, pulling back to reveal that it belongs to a man. He has awoken inside an unfamiliar chamber. Naturally curious, he spins a lever and opens a door that leads to an adjacent compartment. Swelling with pride over this discovery, he does this several times, choosing to finally enter one of them for reasons unknown. Despite the similarities of each cube, he remains cautious. His reluctance was prescient as his first and only step forward results in his body becoming conveniently cubed for efficient storage. We then cut to a couple more cubesters exploring rooms and trying to make the best choices they can. With limited information they opt to group up and work together to avoid traps. Before long they discover that they\xe2\x80\x99re in the party room where all roads converge, apparently. Momentarily safe, they gather their thoughts as Rennes sacrifices future foot comfort for the sake of ruling out certain pathways. In comparing notes to try to ascertain what the hell happened, they realize that they all blacked out at some point and then woke up here with no further details about where they are or why they\xe2\x80\x99re here available to them. Quentin, a natural leader, helps Rennes feel empowered by soliciting his advice on how to proceed. His intent is to head in a straight line to the end of the road, which he will do with relative safety due to the boot. Quentin, a cop on the outside, gives Leaven a pep talk to get her squared away and ready as the group begins booting their way along. She finds some room numbers in a shaft, and hopes they\xe2\x80\x99re not sequential as that would indicate a buttload of rooms and they only have a few days to survive without water. To alleviate this Rennes tells Holloway to suck a button - but in a helpful way. Then a room with noticeable ozone indicates the boot is not always truth ahhhh, and the boot has no molecules, of course! Quentin then puts together that Rennes is the Rennes - famous professional prison escapist. He\xe2\x80\x99s been in the paper! Anyway, he has the perfect skill set for this type of circumstance. His first jewel of advice - shut the f up and focus on numero uno. If they all didn\xe2\x80\x99t have boots he could use, he would\xe2\x80\x99ve already left them behind. It\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing he shared this wisdom, because he then demonstrates the consequence of taking things too easy when he gets blasted in the face. And, when they see him again, he is in extreme distress as his head has been reformed into a little soup bowl that holds the bubbling, foamy remains of his face. But, if this is his fate, the pro, what of the rest of them, they wonder? Then they also get caught up in trying to figure out the reason they were chosen for whatever this is. Leaven and Worth claim to be a couple of boring normies. And Holloway, the doctor, criticizes Worth for being a porn dog while Quentin puzzles over why Leaven the student was allowed to keep her glasses. Since there\xe2\x80\x99s no such thing as a coincidence Leaven is encouraged to put her academics to the test and she quickly recognizes trap rooms are marked by prime numbers. She can confirm this because she remembers all of the prior numbers from the rooms she\xe2\x80\x99s passed through. Yep, just a typical math student from the local university. The boot confirms what the brain has derived, and Leaven begins to find her voice. Now they progress quickly, carried through by her infallible numerology, making their way through - but to where? They eventually take a break for some casual chit chat at which point Quentin shares that he has three kids I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to hear that what is this conversation!? Soon after they hit the end of the road - a room with all adjacent prime numbers and only one door unchecked. Quentin climbs up to scope it out, but finds it already occupied by Kazan. His arrival now requires them to move a little more slowly to accommodate his anxiety and color preferences. As they move through, they ponder who the mastermind may be. Quentin suggests some sort of rich psychopath, but Holloway finds this laughable. But her hubris is quickly punished when she jumps down and chokes on her button - great, now she has to wait until it passes to suck it again. With each new room blending with the last, they get a bit too casual and Quentin finds himself inside a razor wire contraption. He manages to dive out with only a partial leg shave, but they also recognize that they can no longer trust the prime number hypothesis. Quentin has a sneaking suspicion that Worth knew the trap was there, but he lets it go and when they all regroup they take a rest so Leaven can try to work things out. Unfortunately, this experience has turned her from a meek churchmouse into a bossy little knowitall who complains about everything - like when Kazan starts peeing inside their room. When Worth starts up again with his nihilism, Quentin has another go at him. He expresses his utter disdain and suggests that, if nothing means anything, why doesn\xe2\x80\x99t he just go jump in a cube? Which, of course, he does not. Quentin riles him up enough to cause him to slip up and reveal that he has some knowledge of this place. Although, he contends that he was only contracted to design the outer candy shell. He knows nothing specific, because they were all compartmentalized and only worked on one piece. This sounds a lot like governmental conspiracy, so Holloway gets jacked up at the thought of being correct in her assessment. But Worth suggests that it was just a thing that came together with no grand purpose and no real intention - somehow. And that it\xe2\x80\x99s being used only to demonstrate that it\xe2\x80\x99s not pointless. Their presence is a manifestation of the out-of-control nature of humanity, or something. If it\xe2\x80\x99s any consolation, Worth does find catharsis in the admission and subsequent beating. Leaven does, at least, get the outer dimensions of the cube. After walking off their room, she figures the whole thing\xe2\x80\x99s got twenty six cubes in any direction She then realizes that the numbers are Cartesian coordinates. But, if that\xe2\x80\x99s true, she started in a room that should have been outside the cube. But at least they have a general idea how far along they are. Although, there is still the ever present danger of traps. Unwilling to backtrack after coming this far, and working out that the next room is set off by noise, Quentin insists on traversing it with Worth taking the lead. They then begin the process of slowly and quietly descending into the blue box. Worth lucks out in that the first room he checks passes the boot test, so they\xe2\x80\x99re all lowered in. Kazan puts it on hard mode as he comes down on the opposite side of the room, and then also doesn\xe2\x80\x99t watch his step very well. Luckily they are able to turn the crank to release him. Quentin comes down last at the exact moment that the lower door makes its final turn on its own, but this doesn\xe2\x80\x99t set off the trap. However, when Kazan expresses his excitement, it does give Quentin the chance to look like a total badass for the second time. Now that he\xe2\x80\x99s all geared up, he and Holloway have it out over the differences between progressive ideals and authoritarianism, resulting in a complete loss of control that degrades his trustworthiness as a leader. Once that nasty business is wrapped up, Worth opens the next door to reveal the darkness of the outer shell. With nothing out there and nothing to hold onto, Quentin suggests they swing around in the dark to see if they can find a way down. Given the weight limit of their makeshift rope, Holloway volunteers to be the test subject. She only gets about one box down, and the rest of them aren\xe2\x80\x99t really able to hold her when she attempts to swing. What\xe2\x80\x99s more, when a nearby rumble shakes them, the gang loses their grip on the rope. Quentin manages to hold on, but when she reaches him he gets that look in his eyes and lets her go, which is exacerbated by the sudden disappearance of the rope. Now down to the four of them, they agree to take a refreshing nap to recharge their batteries. But basically as soon as they all hit REM sleep, he steals Leaven to the next room and tries to convince her that they are the keys to getting out and the others are traps. But his similes take on an uncomfortably sexual air. Then the others arrive, but they seem standoffish for some reason and no matter how hard Quentin hits them, they don\xe2\x80\x99t warm up to him. Then he uses worthless Worth as a trap tester, which is flippin hilarious. After all that effort, they\xe2\x80\x99ve managed to arrive back with the old Rennester. Then they all allow themselves at least a brief moment of coming unglued. But then Worth gets the idea to check the room that killed Rennes and finds an empty void. This indicates that it\xe2\x80\x99s not them circling, but that the rumbling they\xe2\x80\x99ve been hearing are the cubes themselves changing positions. It then dawns on Leaven that she should\xe2\x80\x99ve been using all the numbers, not just the first one. The additional digits indicate permutations of movement and cycles. When she remembers the cube that seemed to have the impossible coordinate, she posits that if they can get back to that cube,when it returns to its original position they will be outside the cube at large. So Leaven gets to computing in an attempt to solve the puzzle. After figuring their room, she asks for numbers from all the others to use as reference points. Based on this information, she identifies that there are two cycles left before they would be stuck waiting for the whole thing to start over again. In other good news, she now recognizes that trap rooms are identified not by prime numbers, but by numbers that are a power of a prime. The bad news is that she can\xe2\x80\x99t compute these astronomical numbers. But they discover that Kazan can, so at his request Worth offers him all the gumdrops he can cram in his piehole if he just gets them out of there that\xe2\x80\x99s not the point! They confirm the next room is safe, but not if it\xe2\x80\x99s the correct room, but they go in anyway. They begin moving quickly and Worth makes an attempt to free them of the hassle of Quentin\xe2\x80\x99s volatile paranoia by dropping him into a cube. Then they really get going until eventually, and apparently through pure luck, they find their original cube. Indicating, of course, that if they had worked things out to begin with, they didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to move at all. They are waylaid when Kazan fails to cross over in time. His screams indicate he is not far, so Worth goes to retrieve him as Leaven confirms their location and reveals that the next room should take them to the bridge. They all pile in and get yeeted into oblivion. After the final move they transfer into what they presume to be the bridge. Sure enough, when they open the door, they\xe2\x80\x99re greeted by the blinding white light of heaven. But Worth isn\xe2\x80\x99t feeling so great, he\xe2\x80\x99s morose and decides that there\xe2\x80\x99s not really anything out there waiting for him to give his life meaning. This works out well as Quentin appears and shares his new philosophy that freedom is only for the strong, and he starts getting stabby. But after he drops his implement and attempts to leave, Worth catches him by the heel and holds on just long enough for the rooms to start back up again, converting Quentin into a humble wall smear. Then Worth lays down and dies as Kazan wanders off in search of gumdrops. Cube is a very interesting and unique premise for a horror film. And I think they did a really good job of putting this together and making it look so good despite the small budget. The acting was a bit stage theater at times, but I think the primary shortfalls of the movie arose from the attempt to cram so much story into the standard timeframe. It required them to move along at a fairly high pace and left a lot of questions in my mind. I enjoyed the idea that they don\xe2\x80\x99t know why they\xe2\x80\x99re in the cube or who was responsible for it. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that needs to be explained. But then, in that vein, they probably didn\xe2\x80\x99t need to spend as much time talking about it. It would have been better to use that time to explain or show the characters setting some establishing rules to help bring the movie together. For instance, they seemed to move in and out of rooms fairly directly. They didn\xe2\x80\x99t check every door each time or really discuss what direction they were going or why. If they set that up at the beginning so we know it\xe2\x80\x99s part of their method, it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t need to be shown each time. Also, in regards to the movement, it was interesting to have different methodologies for identifying safe and unsafe rooms. However, the way they went about revealing those changes made it seem like the success they had experienced from their prior methods were basically the result of sheer luck. If you know the numbers mean something, why not spend more time sorting out what they mean? Also, if they\xe2\x80\x99re meaningful, why would you ever assume that only one of the three sequences is useful? If you\xe2\x80\x99re wrong about how the trap rooms are identified, how the hell did you make it so far without finding that out the hard way? Maybe it has something to do with the relationship between prime numbers and factors of prime numbers that they essentially worked the same, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not mathematically literate enough to be able to confirm that. And they didn\xe2\x80\x99t make it seem like that was the case. In addition, it seemed odd, given the limited time they had, that they weren\xe2\x80\x99t proceeding under a general principle to guide them and streamline decision making. Rennes indicated he was going in a straight line to the end. But, after what they sorted out later about the size and quantity of the cubes, it seems like it would make sense to adopt a rule like go down every time you have the opportunity to go down. We do learn that this wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have gotten them out, but they didn\xe2\x80\x99t know that until much later. Aside from that, the only other real criticism I would have comes from the weird continuity errors they introduced into the film. There are characters who should have seen each other at certain times, but didn\xe2\x80\x99t. Or Quentin showing up out of nowhere at the end - how did he find them let alone enter the room without being noticed? There are a few things like this throughout, but I think these are minor gaffes overall, because the way the story is presented is interesting enough that some of these elements, likely added for stylistic or dramatic purposes, are easily overlooked.
