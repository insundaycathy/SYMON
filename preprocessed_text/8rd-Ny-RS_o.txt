Story Recapped here. Today, I'm going to explain an action, fantasy, thriller film called \xe2\x80\x9cUnderworld.\xe2\x80\x9d Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care. Vampires and werewolves, called Lycans, have existed in the world for over a thousand years. These Immortals have been at war for centuries, and the Vampires have successfully hunted the Lycans, pushing them to the brink of extinction. The war had its first significant turn at the death of the Lycan leader, Lucian. The vampires believe that they have gained the upper hand, on the verge of eliminating the Lycans from the world. Or so they thought. Selene and another vampire are tracking two Lycans headed to a subway. The Lycan, Raze, and his fellow werewolf are also stalking Michael Corvinus, a human. As Michael boards the train, he sees Selene, but she looks away. Raze closes in on Michael but senses vampires nearby. Before he could reach Michael, he warns his companion that vampires are following them. Raze starts shooting, and a firefight ensues. The other vampire gets shot, and Selene sees the bullets glowing inside him. A bystander gets shot, and Michael dives in to help. A Lycan tries to grab Michael, but Selene starts shooting. The Lycans retreat, and Selene, along with another vampire, give chase. Selene goes after one of the Lycans while the other vampire pursues Raze. Raze gets tackled, and they end up on the train tracks. Eager to finish the fight, Raze transform into a werewolf and charges the vampire. Selene tracks the other Lycan deeper into the tunnels before finally finding the Lycan and shooting him with silver bullets. Selene checks the Lycan\xe2\x80\x99s gun to see the bullets are glowing. Suddenly, Raze appears behind her, but she escapes after impaling Raze with several bladed discs. As she hides from Raze, she hears growling and roaring from in the tunnels. Sounds of other Lycans fighting and cheering in an underground fighting pen fill the tunnels. Before she could investigate further, Raze appears, and she leaves. At the fighting pit, a Lycan, who appears to be the leader, appears. He is visibly disappointed, even disgusted by his fellow Lycans\xe2\x80\x99 behavior, and stops the fighting. Selene returns to the vampire mansion, heads directly to Kahn, the vampire weapons expert, and shows him the glowing bullets. He discovers that the bullets are laced with ultraviolet radiation, making them highly effective against vampires. Kraven, the current vampire leader, heads down to meet with Selene and Kahn. Selene tells Kraven that she sensed there could potentially be hundreds of Lycans hiding in the tunnels. Kraven listens but says they cannot act on mere speculation, especially within the eve of an important awakening ceremony. Kahn is in disbelief, saying a number of that magnitude hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been seen in centuries. Kraven tells Selene that he\xe2\x80\x99ll have her claims investigated, and Selene answers back, saying Viktor would have believed her without hesitation. Selene visits Viktor\xe2\x80\x99s tomb and Erika, another vampire who\xe2\x80\x99s in love with Kraven, tells Selene not to worry and reminds her to prepare for the ceremony. Selene later checks on the images they captured from the scene and sees that the Lycans were following a human. Erika enters, bringing a dress for Selene, but Selene is focused on the human. Kraven arrives and tells Selene he\xe2\x80\x99d love to have her by his side in the ceremony, but she shrugs, telling him to have Erika instead, as she\xe2\x80\x99s the one who\xe2\x80\x99s head-over-heels for him. At the Lycans\xe2\x80\x99 lair, a scientist, Singe, mixes the blood of a human with a Lycan\xe2\x80\x99s. He examines it, finding out that the blood is incompatible. Their leader enters and sees their experiment has failed, and Singe tells him that they need to get a sample of Michael\xe2\x80\x99s blood to see whether or not it would work. Raze later arrives carrying the fallen werewolf. The leader is disappointed to hear that they\xe2\x80\x99ve failed to get a sample of Michael\xe2\x80\x99s blood and decides to do it himself. Selene breaks into Michael\xe2\x80\x99s apartment, looking for clues as to why the Lycans were after him. Michael arrives, and Selene grabs him, holding him by the neck. She asks why the Lycans are after him, but he denies any knowledge of what is happening. Michael recognizes Selene as the woman from the train shootout. Not long after, Lycans appear. Michael runs to the elevator, and Selene misses him. The Lycans burst through the windows, and Selene starts shooting at them. The Lycans are less affected by silver bullets in their pure form, so Selene tries to escape through the floor. Michael heads down and comes face to face with the Lycan leader. Selene shoots him, but he bites Michael. Selene drags Michael away, and the leader lets them go, having taken a blood sample from Michael and placing it in a test tube. The leader then uses his powers to push the silver bullets out of his body and chases Selene. Selene and Michael drive away, but the leader catches up to them, jumping on top of the car. He uses a blade and stabs through the roof, wounding Selene. Selene manages to get the leader off the roof and tries ramming him, but he rolls over the car and lands safely behind them. Michael and Selene escape, and Michael sees that Selene is bleeding profusely. He asks her to stop the car, but she shrugs and keeps driving. She loses consciousness, and the car flips and falls into a river. Michael drags Selene to safety and tries mending her wounds. At the Lycan lair, and Singe mixes Michael\xe2\x80\x99s blood. They confirm that Michael\xe2\x80\x99s blood is what they have been looking for. They need Michael for an experiment they\xe2\x80\x99ll perform on the Lycan leader. On the riverbank, Michael and Selene lay unconscious. Michael gets a strange dream before awakening and seeing he\xe2\x80\x99s at the vampire mansion. Erika sees Michael and is delighted to see Selene has brought a human to the house. She tells Selene that Kraven is looking for her. Selene meets with an angry Kraven. He scolds Selene for blatantly disobeying his orders and for bringing a human into the mansion. Selene maintains her theory that the Lycans are interested in Michael, and she needs to figure out why. Kraven thinks her theory ridiculous, saying Lycans would only be interested in humans for food. Erika takes a closer look at Michael and sees the bite mark. She reels back immediately, launching herself to the ceiling. Michael wakes up again, in complete shock, seeing Erika on the ceiling. He rushes to the window and jumps out. He runs for the gate and escapes the estate. Kraven barges in with Selene seeing Michael had escaped. He slaps Selene in anger. Selene is at the house\xe2\x80\x99s firing range when Kahn approaches, giving her a gun. She shoots and sees liquid oozing out of the bullet holes. This is Kahn\xe2\x80\x99s latest invention, silver nitrate bullets. Once a Lycan gets shot, the silver injects itself into their bloodstream, making it harder to remove. Selene expresses her doubt about Kraven\xe2\x80\x99s stories. The vampires were told that Kraven killed Lucian, but Selene is suspicious, saying the only evidence they have is Kraven\xe2\x80\x99s account. Kraven then leaves and meets up with someone at an alley. He enters another car, and it\xe2\x80\x99s revealed he\xe2\x80\x99s meeting with the Lycan leader. Kraven is mad about the Lycans overstepping their boundaries, but the leader tells Kraven they\xe2\x80\x99ve been waiting long enough. Kraven then reveals that the Lycan leader is Lucian, the Lycan who Kraven said he had killed. Selene breaks into the mansion\xe2\x80\x99s library and reads about the past. She reads the story of the great vampire-werewolf war and Lucian\xe2\x80\x99s defeat. It turns out that Kraven was the sole survivor of a group of vampires sent to assassinate Lucian. Kraven returned with a piece of Lucian\xe2\x80\x99s skin as evidence of the kill. Selene then sees a drawing of Lucian wearing a necklace, the same necklace she saw on the werewolf that bit Michael. She then realizes that that werewolf must have been Lucian. She then runs into Erika, and she tells her that Michael has been bitten and will be turning into a Lycan soon. Desperate for guidance, Selene decides to awaken Viktor, one of three powerful elder vampires. She enters Viktor\xe2\x80\x99s tomb and begins the awakening ceremony by herself. Selene draws her blood and lets it drip into Viktor\xe2\x80\x99s mouth. She apologizes to Viktor for waking him ahead of schedule, but she is in desperate need of his guidance, as she suspects Kraven had lied about killing Lucian. Michael appears at the mansion\xe2\x80\x99s gates, and Selene goes to retrieve him. Kraven warns her that she will no longer be welcome at the mansion if she goes out to meet Michael, but Selene dismisses Kraven\xe2\x80\x99s threat, knowing Viktor is now awake and that Viktor would vouch for her. She drives to Michael, and they take off. Selene tells Michael that he\xe2\x80\x99s been dragged into a war between vampires and werewolves that has been raging for centuries. She tells him that he\xe2\x80\x99s been bitten and he\xe2\x80\x99ll soon become a Lycan. Kraven enters the tomb, and Erika tells him about Michael being a Lycan. Viktor then reveals himself, and Erika and Kraven bow. Viktor expresses his disappointment in Kraven\xe2\x80\x99s leadership. He then orders to awaken Marcus, another elder vampire. Kraven informs him that Marcus is yet to be awakened, and Amelia, a third elder vampire, is on her way to initiate the ceremony. Selene had revived Viktor an entire century ahead of schedule. Selene takes Michael to one of their secret interrogation rooms, and she tells her about her origins. Selene was a young woman when Lycans came and killed her whole family. It was Viktor who saved her and turned her into a vampire. She now spends her life killing the monsters that killed her family, treating Viktor like a father. Selene intends to head back to the mansion, but Michael wants to join her. She then handcuffs Michael to a chair and tells him a full moon will rise the following night. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be unable to control himself and end up eating and killing anything he finds. She then hands him a gun with a single silver bullet. The bullet won\xe2\x80\x99t kill him, but it could delay his transformation. She then advises him to shoot himself. Selene arrives back at the mansion and finally faces Viktor. He demands to know why she awakened him early, saying the elders had never broken their chain of command in over 14 centuries. Two of the elder vampires must be at rest while one reigns. It was supposed to be Marcus\xe2\x80\x99 turn to reign, not Viktor\xe2\x80\x99s. Selene tells Viktor she had no choice, and she believes the vampires are in danger. Viktor distrusts Selene, knowing she\xe2\x80\x99s protecting the Lycan, Michael. She tells him she\xe2\x80\x99ll gather evidence, but Viktor prefers to have Kraven do it instead, reasoning that Kraven isn\xe2\x80\x99t protecting a Lycan. Viktor then tells Selene that the council would pass judgment on her for breaking the cycle of command. Kraven then imprisons Selene at the mansion, preventing her from going to Michael. Kraven then tells Kahn that a different group of vampires is tasked to meet with Amelia. Khan is suspicious as it\xe2\x80\x99s always been his group\xe2\x80\x99s job to do it. At the station, Amelia\xe2\x80\x99s train arrives, but Lycans ambush them. Amelia\xe2\x80\x99s group battles them, but the vampires sent to meet with them just watch the slaughter. Michael tries to free himself from the handcuffs, using the silver bullet to break the chain, but he misses. He feels the effects of the full moon, and his heart rate and breathing speed up. Jealous of Kraven\xe2\x80\x99s lust for Selene, Erika decides to free Selene, allowing her to go to Michael. Erika hopes this would lead to Selene\xe2\x80\x99s downfall, and she informs Kraven that Selene had escaped. The Lycans waiting outside the mansion see Selene leaving, and they follow her to Michael. As Selene makes her way up to Michael, she sees Lycans following her. She reaches Michael, but Lycans are at the door. She begins shooting blindly at the door while Michael escapes. He jumps from the window and surprisingly lands on his feet. Selene holds off the attacking Lycans, but on the streets, Lycans subdue and capture Michael, taking him into a police mobile and driving away. Selene sees the men driving away with Michael and decides to let them go for the time being. She then spots Singe alive among the pile of lifeless Lycans. At the mansion, Kahn is convinced that Kraven is up to something nefarious and orders his men to check on Amelia. At the train station, Lycans kill Amelia, and Raze draws her blood. Meanwhile, the men who took Michael are noticing that he\xe2\x80\x99s beginning to transform. They pull over and inject him with a substance, preventing his transformation. Once his transformation is halted, they continue. Kraven meets with a now fully formed Viktor when Selene arrives with Singe. Selene forces Singe to tell the truth, and he does so. He confesses that the Lycans have been searching for a direct descendant of Alexander Corvinus. He begins by telling them the origin of vampires and werewolves. Alexander Corvinus, a powerful warlord from the fifth century, had risen to power, but a deadly plague ravaged his village, and only he survived. Alexander\xe2\x80\x99s body had mutated the virus, and instead of killing him, it gave him supernatural abilities. He became the first Immortal and gave birth to three children. Viktor chimes in, saying they all know the myth of the Corvinus clan. A wolf bit one child, a bat bit another, and a third one walked the lonely road of mortality as a human. Viktor says Marcus, whose tomb is right next to them, is a direct descendant of Alexander, but Singe says Marcus is already a vampire. They needed to find the human descendant of Alexander, one who carried the virus but is neither vampire nor werewolf. They aimed to fuse Lycan blood with Vampire blood but never succeeded. But when they found Michael, they discovered that his blood would be the key. With his genetic makeup, they could fuse vampire DNA with werewolf DNA, creating a hybrid half-vampire, half-werewolf creature that would be stronger than both. They plan to have Lucian inject himself with Michael\xe2\x80\x99s blood, along with the blood of an elder Vampire, Amelia. Viktor is finally convinced that Lucian is alive and Selene is right all along. Khan then enters the tomb and announces Amelia had been assassinated and Lycans had drained her blood. Viktor strikes Singe, and he dies instantly. Viktor then tasks Selene with finding and eliminating Michael. Lucian draws Michael\xe2\x80\x99s blood at the Lycan lair, and Michael pleads to Lucian to let him go, as he had nothing to do with their war. Lucian laughs, saying this isn\xe2\x80\x99t his war. It is Viktor\xe2\x80\x99s. Michael then gets a vision of the past and sees Lucian in chains in front of a woman vampire who\xe2\x80\x99s also bound. Sunlight fills the room, and Lucian watches as his beloved Sonja burns to death. Viktor then enters the room and retrieves Sonja\xe2\x80\x99s necklace, but the full moon rises, and Lucian transforms into a werewolf. Lucian breaks free, taking the necklace and escaping. Lucian then tells his side of the story. The Lycans were slaves to the vampires, forced to guard their tombs in the daylight. He fell in love with Sonja, Viktor\xe2\x80\x99s daughter. Viktor was enraged by the union and planned to kill both of them, but Lucian escaped. Lucian then says Viktor started the war, spending centuries hunting down the Lycans. Kraven arrives, and Lucian goes to meet him. Kraven is panicked, seeing how his plans are falling apart, but Lucian reassures him that with Amelia dead and with Michael\xe2\x80\x99s blood, their peace treaty would soon take effect, leaving Krarven to lead the vampires. Kraven tells Lucian that Viktor had awakened and they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t defeat him, but Lucian is confident Michael\xe2\x80\x99s blood would give him the power to defeat Viktor. The vampires suddenly show up at the lair, and the Lycans prepare for battle. Kraven realizes he\xe2\x80\x99s about to lose and shoots Lucian with several rounds of the silver nitrate bullets. Lucian falls, unable to combat the silver nitrate coursing through his veins. Selene and Kahn lead the vampire charge and dispatch the defending Lycans with ease. Raze arrives carrying Amelia\xe2\x80\x99s blood but discovers he\xe2\x80\x99s too late, seeing Lucian dying. The gunshots continue, and Lucian tries forcing the silver out of him, determined to live. Selene then runs to find Michael and eliminates two Lycans along the way. Kraven tries to escape, making his way up a ladder but sees Viktor arriving. He jumps down and tries to hide. Selene finally finds Michael, and Lucian sees them kissing. He realizes the war would never be put to rest as another Lycan has fallen in love with a vampire. Selene and Michael try to escape but run into Kraven. Kraven then shoots Michael with the silver nitrate bullets, and silver starts flooding his blood. Kraven then tells Selene that it was Viktor, not the Lycans, who killed her family. Viktor fed on them and only spared Selene because she reminded him of Sonja. Lucian appears and stabs Kraven\xe2\x80\x99s leg, disabling him. Lucian sees Selene and Michael\xe2\x80\x99s love for one another, and he tells Selene to bite Michael. His stronger blood would survive a transmission from both a vampire and a werewolf, and he would rise stronger. Selene then digs her fangs into Michael\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder. Kraven recovers, and Lucian laughs at him. He\xe2\x80\x99s satisfied because his mission is completed in the form of Michael. Kraven then shoots several more bullets into Lucian, rendering him lifeless. Viktor arrives and removes Selene from Michael. Viktor then picks up Michael and throws him through a wall. Selene tells Viktor that she knows the truth about her family. Viktor admits it but reasons out that he has given her much more in exchange. Now filled with both vampire and werewolf blood, Michael begins transforming into a hideous amalgamation of the two. Viktor prepares to battle Michael, but Michael is faster and stronger. The two exchange blows, but Viktor still manages to gain the upper hand even with Michael\xe2\x80\x99s advantage. The rest of the vampires help Viktor and shoot Michael, but Selene neutralizes them quickly. Viktor and Michael continue fighting, and Selene takes Viktor\xe2\x80\x99s sword and slices Viktor across the face. Viktor\xe2\x80\x99s head is cut in half, and he falls. Selene and Michael now have to leave and remain in hiding, knowing that the werewolves and vampires may settle for a truce just to hunt them down. Back at the vampire mansion, Singe\xe2\x80\x99s blood drips down into Marcus\xe2\x80\x99 tomb. The blood makes its way down to his mouth, starting Marcus\xe2\x80\x99 heart, awakening him.
