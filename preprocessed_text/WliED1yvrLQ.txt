Story Recapped here. Today, I'm going to explain an action, horror, sci-fi film called \xe2\x80\x9cCloverfield.\xe2\x80\x9d Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care. Jason and Lily, a young couple, are busy walking through the streets of New York, preparing a surprise party for Jason\xe2\x80\x99s brother whose leaving for Japan on a new career venture. They document their day with a camera, planning to give it to Jason\xe2\x80\x99s brother as a souvenir. At Jason\xe2\x80\x99s apartment, Jason tasks his brother\xe2\x80\x99s best friend, Hudson, or Hud, to take the camera and record the party. Jason asks Hud to go around the party recording messages for Jason\xe2\x80\x99s brother. Jason has his farewell message recorded first, wishing his brother a safe journey and more success in Japan. Hud goes around the apartment, recording messages from everyone, and Lily sees him operating the camera. Lily is a little bothered with Hud doing it since she asked Jason, but she lightens up and has her message recorded. As Hud records Lily's message, he focuses on Marlena, a girl he has a crush on. Hud goes to Marlena to get her to leave a message for Jason\xe2\x80\x99s brother, but Marlena looks uncomfortable and tries avoiding it. She reasons that she and Jason\xe2\x80\x99s brother aren\xe2\x80\x99t close enough and thinks it would be weird for her to leave him a parting message. She says she\xe2\x80\x99s only there for Lily and would be leaving soon. Hud doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take no for an answer, and Marena reluctantly agrees. Marlena excuses herself after. Rob, Jason\xe2\x80\x99s brother, finally arrives and is surprised to see a party thrown for him. He gives a short speech thanking them. Rob later asks if Beth, a girl he likes, would come. Hud tells him he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t see why Beth wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t come, as they\xe2\x80\x99ve been friends for a long time. The party continues, and Rob goes around, talking to everyone. Beth finally arrives, and Rob greets her, but he\xe2\x80\x99s surprised to see she came with a date. Hud later sees Rob sulking while watching Beth, and Hud asks Rob if there\xe2\x80\x99s a problem. Rob is reluctant to share his thoughts and says nothing is wrong. Hud then goes to Beth and asks to get her message. Beth agrees, and she leaves a noticeably heartfelt message for Rob. Rob then interrupts them and asks to speak with Beth in private. Hud tells Jason he\xe2\x80\x99s noticing something strange about how Beth and Rob are acting, but Jason tells him it\xe2\x80\x99s probably nothing. Hud then sneaks into the hallway, trying to get Rob and Beth\xe2\x80\x99s argument on camera. Rob is mad that Beth brought a guy to his party, but Beth is also angry at Rob, saying he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t contacted her in weeks. Rob sees Hud, and Lily drags Rob back in. Hud tells Jason that Lily may know what Rob and Beth were fighting about and tells Jason to convince Lily to tell them. Lily gives in and reveals that Beth and Rob have slept together. Hud then goes around, telling everyone about Rob and Beth. Beth steps back in, taking her date and leaving. Lily sees Rob is upset and tries to get Jason and Hud to talk to him. Jason and Hud then go into Rob\xe2\x80\x99s room and try to cheer him up. Rob tells them that the night he and Beth shared was spur-of-the-moment. Hud tells Rob that Beth is upset because Rob didn\xe2\x80\x99t call her, leaving her feeling like she got blown off. Rob reasons that he shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have called her anyway since he was leaving for Japan soon. Jason gets frank with Rob and tells him that he should have pursued Beth and tells him Beth is out of his league. Jason adds that Rob should think about what he wants since he knows Rob\xe2\x80\x99s had feelings for Beth for a long time. A loud boom disrupts them, and the power goes out. The ground shakes, and people inside are terrified. The power is restored, and a news report informs them of an earthquake. The report also talks of an oil tanker capsized in the harbor near the Statue of Liberty. Hud and Jason decide to go up to the roof to see if they could get a better look at the incident. Everybody heads up to the roof, and a massive explosion lights up the sky. Everyone rushes back in and heads downstairs. Fireballs rain on pedestrians running on the streets, and another loud boom is heard. More explosions occur, and a massive object falls from the sky. Hud sees that it\xe2\x80\x99s the Statue of Liberty\xe2\x80\x99s head. The rumbling continues, and Hud sees an enormous creature moving through the buildings. A skyscraper collapses, and they seek shelter inside a building. The rumbling intensifies, and the massive creature passes by. Things calm down, and Jason steps out with Hud. Hud shows them what he captured on video, and Jason suggests they leave the city immediately. They start walking, heading to the Brooklyn bridge. They get to the bridge and join crowds of people also planning to leave the city. Hud sees the creature's wreckage in different parts of the city, and Rob gets a phone call from Beth. Rob, Lily, Marlena, and Hud stop and wait for Rob, but Jason gets separated. Rob hears Beth saying she can't move and asks for his help. Panic starts on the bridge, and Lily calls to Jason, a fair distance away. Suddenly, a massive appendage lifts out of the water and crashes into the bridge, falling directly on Jason\xe2\x80\x99s location, crushing him. The bridge starts collapsing, and people fall into the bay. Lily, Hud, Marlena, and Rob all make it back to the streets, but Lily and Rob are in a state of shock. Hud talks to Rob, but he stares blankly. Rob notices his battery has run out, and he runs to a ransacked store to get batteries. Hud sees what happened at the bridge and gets a clearer look at the creature attacking the city from the news footage. Military trucks roll in, and the report shows soldiers battling the giant creature. The reports detail small creatures falling off of the monster, lunging and attacking the soldiers. Rob finally gets through to Beth. Beth tells him that her apartment has fallen, and she\xe2\x80\x99s pinned down, unable to escape, pleading for Rob to come and help her. Rob decides to head to Beth\xe2\x80\x99s location, and the rest try to talk him out of it, but Lily decides to accompany him. Hud and Marlena have no choice but to follow. The behemoth suddenly appears, and they\xe2\x80\x99re caught in a crossfire. Bullets and missiles fly. The group then decides to run into the subway, seeking shelter underground. They reach the subway station and regroup, rethinking how they will rescue Beth and leave the city. Rob\xe2\x80\x99s mother calls, and he breaks the unfortunate news that Jason has died. They then decide to walk the tunnels to Beth's apartment, thinking that it would be safer to travel underground. They walk in darkness but hear strange noises coming from the tunnel. They see rats scurrying away, seemingly running away from something. They start running too and decide to resurface at the next station. Hud turns on the camera's night vision and sees creatures on the tunnel ceiling, the same creature that fell off the monster and attacked soldiers. He tells everyone to run as fast as they can, but the creatures attack. Lily gets pinned, and Rob helps her. Hud trips and holds a creature back with his legs, and Marlena helps him, beating the beast with a metal pipe. Another beast comes and tackles her down, and she gets bit. Hud and Rob kick the creature off Marlena, and they all head into a maintenance room, locking the creatures out. Marlena gets a deep gash on her back, and Rob opens a vending machine, getting several water bottles for Marlena to wash her wounds. They then decide to head above ground, making their way through hallways and finding bright lights at a distance. They approach the lights, and Marlena says she\xe2\x80\x99s feeling dizzy. They\xe2\x80\x99re soon greeted by soldiers and are taken to their base. They enter an infirmary and see dozens of casualties. Rob informs them about Beth, but the soldiers tell them they can\xe2\x80\x99t do anything to help. Rob starts begging, but Marlena suddenly starts bleeding from her nose and eyes. The soldiers and medical personnel spring into action, dragging Marlena away to quarantine her. They rush her out, and the rest of the group are in panic, not knowing what\xe2\x80\x99s happening to Marlena. Hud sees Marlena\xe2\x80\x99s body inflate and explode, her blood spraying all over. The rest of the group are dragged outside, and a soldier is willing to let them go to save Beth. He warns them that an airstrike would be coming in soon, and the last of the evacuation helicopters would also be leaving soon. They have to save Beth and make it to the evacuation area before the bombing starts. They finally get to Beth\xe2\x80\x99s apartment and see her building barely standing, leaning on another building. They decide to climb the standing building, making their way up and crossing over to Beth\xe2\x80\x99s building. They make their way to the 39th floor of the adjacent building before crossing over. They find Beth impaled by a steel bar, pinned to the floor. They get her up and start making their way down. They cross over to the adjacent building again and see the creature getting bombarded by fighter jets. They make it back to the streets and start running for the evacuation helicopters. Hud gets a good view of the monster as the military battles it, the creature seemingly unaffected by whatever the soldiers throw at it. They reach the helicopters, but only Lily gets loaded in, and they have to get into a different chopper. They fly out, and Hud gets a clear bird\xe2\x80\x99s eye view of the fight. They finally see the monster in its entirety. The airstrike arrives, and the bombs hit the monster. It falls, and dust fills their view. Hud cheers, but the monster pops out of the smoke and hits their chopper, making them spin out of control. The helicopter crashlands on Central Park, and Beth wakes Hud. They pull Rob out and start helping him walk away, but the monster suddenly appears behind them. It looms over Hud before it leans down and eats him. The camera falls back down, focusing on a lifeless Hud. Rob and Beth hide under a small bridge and hear bombers approaching. Beth cries, saying she\xe2\x80\x99s terrified, feeling helpless knowing all of their friends are dead or missing. Rob tries recording a message, stating his name and his accounts of what happened. Rob points the camera at Beth, but fire engulfs them, and the bridge collapses on top of them. Rob finally tells Beth he loves him, and Beth tells him the same. More bombs drop, and the camera recording cuts off.
