Welcome to Cinema Summary, ladies and gentlemen. Today\xe2\x80\x99s movie is all about one question: What would you do for a million dollars? This is the Box The movie starts with a classified document. It\xe2\x80\x99s about this guy named Arlington Steward He had a terrible accident which we will find out about later. After his accident he starts making these weird, wooden boxes and delivering them to people. Norma Lewis, a woman who lives in Richmond, Virginia. Finds one of these boxes on her doorstep one day. It\xe2\x80\x99s morning, it\xe2\x80\x99s foggy and there is a black car driving away. She brings it inside, and her, her husband, and her kid try to figure out what it is. The box is locked but through the see-through cover they can see a big red button They find a note a note with the box and it says that Mr. Steward will visit them at 5:00 PM and none of them know who Mr. Steward is Okay, real quick, I'm gonna introduce you to the family before we get to the real crazy stuff, okay? So, Arthur the Dad works at NASA Norma the Mom is a school teacher and Walter the Kid studies at the same school that his mom teaches at. Together they are the Lewis Family They leave home to go to work and in class, a creepy kid asks Norma why she limps and we find out that Norma\xe2\x80\x99s foot is disfigured Later, at school. She meets the principal. Who tells her that the discount given to the teachers who have kids at the same school has been cancelled. And oddly enough, when they are done talking, the principal gets a nose bleed. Back at home, Norma hears the doorbell ring and she opens the door to see: A man with a burned face. Norma is shocked by his appearance and almost doesn\xe2\x80\x99t let him. Until he introduces himself "My name is Arlington Steward." Inside, he gives her an envelope with a key inside. The key that opens the glass cover. and he tells her that if you push the button 2 things will happen 1) Someone, somewhere in the world will die 2) You will get 1 million dollars in cash In a briefcase just like this one and before he leaves he gives her a $100 bill for her kindness. Huh. She doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe him and in fact she\xe2\x80\x99s freaked out by him. But he convinces her that It\xe2\x80\x99s all real and if she presses the button, she will find out the truth and the money is all hers So Arthur is at work building a fake foot for Norma so she can walk normally. When he gets a letter from his boss. He has been rejected from the astronaut training program. He cannot be an astronaut because he failed his psychological evaluation. That evening, Arthur opens up the box with Norma and they find out that it is just wood. There is no way this box could send any signal or message to anyone. and even after this, they still do not know if they should press the button. At NASA the next day, a man receives a phone call from his wife. and she\xe2\x80\x99s freaking out because their daughter has been kidnapped. So he drives to meet her, and we see someone spying on him. Arthur comes back home to tell Norma that The $100 bill she got is real because he tested it and they begin to feel greedy. Suddenly, Norma presses the button, after all: "It\'s just a box." Someone has dialed the 911 (the police) the person calling said they heard screaming and gunshots. The police are on their way to the crime scene where a neighbor tells them there was a guy with a briefcase who drove off. Inside the home, the police find a woman shot dead and a little girl locked in a bathroom. The door bell rings at the Lewis\xe2\x80\x99s home Arlington Steward has come back He asks for the key back and opens his briefcase. The Lewis\xe2\x80\x99s are shocked and horrified! Arthur asks Steward if someone died. To which Steward says \xe2\x80\x9cWell of course someone died." then Norma asks Steward what he will do next and he tells them that he will take the Box to another family and make the same offer to them. He leaves the briefcase full of cash and the house taking the box with him but Arthur can\xe2\x80\x99t handle this. He's guilty, and tries to return the money but Steward drives off and Arthur gets the license plate and rushes back in. At the police station, we learn more about the murder. The police think that the woman\xe2\x80\x99s husband might be the killer. but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make sense: He\xe2\x80\x99s a good guy, never hurt his wife, Never committed a crime. Who is the husband? Jeff Carnes: The same guy who got the phone call from earlier and was being spied on. That night, Arthur gives Norma the fake foot. and we see how she is able to walk normally now. Together they go to a wedding rehearsal dinner. There they meet Norma\xe2\x80\x99s parents and Arthur wins a prize and he chooses a present. He opens the present and Inside is a photo of Arlington Steward. and then he sees the creepy kid from Norma\xe2\x80\x99s class. Holding 2 fingers up. At home with Walter and Dana the Babysitter. Dana sees something We don\xe2\x80\x99t get a clear picture. But we can also see something or someone. Standing outside of the window. She doesn\xe2\x80\x99t say anything about what she sees but Dana does ask to see some of Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s other stuff. So, Walter takes her downstairs to the basement. Arthur has a private talk with his father-in-law who works for the police. Asking him to find information on Arlington Steward by searching for Steward\xe2\x80\x99s license plate. Norma is told she has a phone call waiting for her by waiter. and at first, the waiter is confused but then gives her the phone. The waiter leaves and gets a nosebleed. Okay, now you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna notice something, different people are going to start bleeding from the nose Now there is a reason for this and I will tell you later, but stick with me. Back to the movie On the phone, Steward and Norma talk. Steward tells her that he knows that Arthur told the police about his license plates. He knows about this since. "He has many employees." Huh, creepy and what\xe2\x80\x99s even creepier. Is that he tells her that actions have consequences. And to \xe2\x80\x98enjoy the party\xe2\x80\x99 Arthur sees the creepy kid from earlier laughing at him. He yells at him outside. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy are you laughing?\xe2\x80\x9d. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you think my wife\xe2\x80\x99s foot is funny?\xe2\x80\x9d He\xe2\x80\x99s angry and loud and everyone sees this, including Norma. So, they leave before Arthur does something bad. and as they drive away one of the valet\xe2\x80\x99s raises 2 fingers. When they get home, Arthur drives the babysitter to her motel and during this drive, the babysitter starts talking. Saying creepy things like \xe2\x80\x9cYou have blood on your hands" \xe2\x80\x9cSomebody pushing your buttons?" and warns him to \xe2\x80\x9cLook at the light\xe2\x80\x9d. Then she blacks out. and as soon as they get to her motel. She wakes up! And tells Arthur. He is in danger and that only he can save himself. Then the babysitter gets a nosebleed. She goes to her room and as she\xe2\x80\x99s walking. People just stand outside their rooms watching her and we hear a broadcast. About spaceflight technology. She goes into her room and there\xe2\x80\x99s a wall with photos of Norma, Arthur, and Walter and other information connecting them together. And she\xe2\x80\x99s looking at this. Like she\xe2\x80\x99s seen this for the first time. It\xe2\x80\x99s weird. Outside we see a group of people standing around a glowing swimming pool When he gets home, Arthur asks Norma how she knows Dana the Babysitter She tells him, she met her on a field trip and that Dana is from Richmond but then Arthur shows her Dana\xe2\x80\x99s drivers license: Her real name is Sara and she is from Boston. That night, Arthur goes downstairs. To check the photo of Steward he got from the party and he finds that it matches the photo in his basement. The photo of the people who worked on the Viking 1 Probe The next morning, Norma answers the phone. It\xe2\x80\x99s Mr. Steward, who asks where Arthur went and he asks if Arthur is investigating something he shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. Norma asks if Dana is one of his employees and all he has to say is \xe2\x80\x9cI have many employees\xe2\x80\x9d. She asks to meet him face-to-face. and Steward tells her that he\xe2\x80\x99s in her backyard. and outside, there\xe2\x80\x99s some random dude. Standing outside her window. That was the guy who Dana saw last night. He had been standing there, watching them. Since last night. and then we see where Steward is calling from: It looks like a giant complex built underground like a bunker or a secret military base Meanwhile, Arthur is at the police station talking with his father-in-law who is a policeman. He tells Arthur that Steward\xe2\x80\x99s license plates are used by government agents. Steward\xe2\x80\x99s license plates are used by NSA agents, in fact. And then Arthur notices photos on the desk Photos of the murdered wife. It\xe2\x80\x99s all coming together. His father-in-law (the police officer) is really casual about it Telling him the details: she was shot to death; No signs of a struggle, and that her husband worked at, NASA. Then the he tells Arthur that The gunshots were heard sometime around 4:40 PM and Arthur then has an idea of why she died. and he asks if he can look at the crime scene Meanwhile, Norma is shopping with her mother When suddenly this woman comes to her and She says \xe2\x80\x9cThe NSA is letting him do it. NASA can\xe2\x80\x99t stop it. All test subjects are under the age of 40. Happily married with a single child. Go to the Richmond Public Library and follow this call number. Don\xe2\x80\x99t trust anyone. Not even your husband.\xe2\x80\x9d The woman collapses in Norma\xe2\x80\x99s arms, and the woman gets a nosebleed. Norma decides to go to the library to see what that woman wanted her to see. At the crime scene, Arthur sees a desk on it is a photo of Arlington Steward, before his accident with his wife, Clymene. And there are other things on the desk like this polaroid photo of the Human Resource Exploitation Manual. There are numbers on it\xe2\x80\x99s rim. These are library call numbers for books. Those numbers on the spine of books, that help you find out where they are in a library. So, Arthur sneaks the photo out and goes to the library to check out the call number. Norma is there now, and she\xe2\x80\x99s looking for her call number. When she sees Arthur. She remembers what that woman said \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t trust anyone. Not even your husband\xe2\x80\x9d She hides from him and goes downstairs. Arthur doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know she\xe2\x80\x99s here but he finds a book. But somewhere in the library, a group of guys suddenly turn. The book Arthur found is called The Lightning book. Inside is a newspaper clipping reading \xe2\x80\x9cNASA employee struck by lightning\xe2\x80\x9d. Downstairs, Norma finds what she is looking for, a film reel. She takes it out and plays it. Upstairs, Arthur leaves the book and on his way out. Comes face to face with that group of guys from earlier who follow him. He runs away and they follow him. It\xe2\x80\x99s seriously creepy. They don\xe2\x80\x99t even talk. Downstairs, the film reel shows a building. A NASA building. It looks like a place to put airplanes in and we see scorch marks on the building and tarmac. Arthur is still running away when he enters this big room. As he gets closer and closer, to what he thinks is the exit. The people there turn to look at him. He asks the librarian for directions and he realizes he knows her From the photo! That\xe2\x80\x99s Arlington Steward\xe2\x80\x99s wife : Clymene Steward. Norma continunes watching the film and sees: Arlington Steward. Before his accident looking into the camera. Arthur asks Steward\xe2\x80\x99s Wife, Clymene \xe2\x80\x9cWhy is he testing us?\xe2\x80\x9d and she answers \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s testing us, all of us." And then she asks him to follow her to a side room. there she tells him that there are 3 gateways, but he must be careful There is only 1 path to salvation Whatever that means, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound safe. ander nose starts to bleed as she holds her hand out and below, 3 floor tiles open up. and from them come these weird pillars of water. Norma is trying to get out of library, but she is taken to meet Steward. Steward tells Norma that he was struck by lightning, and now he can talk with the people who control the lightning. Arthur asks what happens if he chooses wrong or if he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t choose at all. Eternal Damnation. So Arthur chooses Gateway 2. Okay so, to clear up a few things: why did Arthur choose Gateway 2? Well, if you remember the kids from earlier: the creepy kid from Norma's class and the valet All did this. They all stuck up 2 fingers and Arthur realizes this and choose it because of that and you even see him hold up 2 fingers in the scene Steward asks Norma what she felt when she saw Steward\xe2\x80\x99s face. She tells him that she felt \xe2\x80\x98love\xe2\x80\x99 for him She knows his pain since she has her own foot that is messed up. Steward seems pleased with her answer and asks her to take his hand. And as soon as she does she blacks out. Meanwhile, Arthur goes through the gate and he\xe2\x80\x99s taken into a tunnel of purest white Like something from another world. Then Norma wakes up. She\xe2\x80\x99s on her bed at home, and Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s there! In a water box that\xe2\x80\x99s floating above her. Arthur collapses onto the bed with the water flowing out of the room. He\xe2\x80\x99s alive but wet and water is everywhere. So they have to clean it up. Walter helps them out but he asks them if they remembered how they got home. Their silence is telling. So he tells them what happened: They came home in the car. They walked in like zombies and collapsed on the bed. Arthur and Norma don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to say. As they try to clean up Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s boss and the NSA head Martin talk. Where Martin tells Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s boss that Mr. Steward was struck by lightning, at the same place they are standing at right now. Steward was declared dead and put into the morgue. Where he came back to life and it was discovered that he could heal very, very fast. As they talk, Steward listens in on their conversation, in his underground base. Later the Lewis's go to a wedding, where Arthur feels unease and without his notice is being watched by a man through a window. In Steward's secret base briefcases and Boxes are being prepared. Steward is asked by Martin \xe2\x80\x9cHow can people pass the test and when will this all end? His answer is simple: The only way to pass the test is to not press the button Back at the wedding, Norma and Arthur have a talk and Arthur describes seeing a light The way he describes it seems like he went to Heaven, a perfect paradise beyond time and space Arthur feels sick after dancing and goes outside for fresh air only to be held up at gunpoint by Jeff Carnes, the guy who got that phone call earlier. Jeff takes him on a car ride and together they leave. At the same time Walter walks out looking for Arthur. Norma follows him outside and then both her and Walter get kidnapped. Jeff shows Arthur classified CIA documents about the Human Resource Exploitation Manual, about the gateways, and tells him that something not human. Has put something into the brains of humans, to control them. Which causes these people to bleed from their nose. Meanwhile at the motel swimming pool, we see Norma taken into the pool. To be judged whether she is good or bad. Jeff then tells Arthur that the reason why he had to kill his wife was because of a decision: it was either kill his daughter or his wife. They stop as a mind-controlled Santa stands in their way and they are run into by a truck. Jeff dies and Arthur is taken somewhere by someone. Meanwhile at the Langley Research Center, the NSA Chief Martin and Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s boss oversee an operation. Soldiers wait with guns ready to shoot, as the doors open. From the inside, Arthur walks out and collapses. He is taken by them back to his home with Norma and there. At home, they meet Steward. Who is sorry about everything that has happened. And he tells them that Walter has become deaf and blind. No human medicine can heal him. Only one thing can and that is a choice. 1) Live the rest of your lives together with Walter, who will forever be blind and deaf but you will have 1 million dollars; or 2) Kill your wife with this gun and when she dies Walter will be able to see and hear again. If they do, Walter will get the money but it will be put into an account he can only access when he\xe2\x80\x99s 18. There are no other options and we see Walter figure out that he\xe2\x80\x99s blind and deaf. Arthur puts the gun to Steward\xe2\x80\x99s head but Steward tells him that it won\xe2\x80\x99t do much. Since Arthur will go to jail for murder and Steward will get a replacement. Before he leaves, Steward tells them that Walter is locked in the bathroom and they try to open the bathroom door. But now they have a choice: save Walter or let him suffer. They come to a decision, and say their goodbyes. We see another couple with a Box of their own. and as they press the button *Norma dies* The police are called and Mr. Steward arrives. To the home of the other couple with a briefcase full of money. "Shall I come in?" The police arrive and arrest Arthur and he is taken away by the NSA while Walter is left behind. The movie ends with Mr. Steward leaving the home with the box in hand. The cycle continues. Who knows when it will end. So what just happened? Aliens! Yeah, like 'real life' aliens! and we know this because of hints throughout the film Like radio broadcasts talking about space stuff or Mr. Stewart coming back to life after being struck by lighting and of course, Walter! Who at the end of movie can't see or hear. But suddenly is able to after his mom dies? How would you explain it? Super advanced alien technology. Now I did say I would explain the nose bleeds The aliens are operating on people, they're cutting open people\xe2\x80\x99s heads, and putting something inside their heads. To control the minds and bodies of people Now the surgery isn\xe2\x80\x99t perfect, so sometimes, people bleed from the nose. And if that isn't enough then my favourite clue in the movie is when Norma and Arthur get back from the library They don\xe2\x80\x99t remember how they got there (home) This is an experience known as \xe2\x80\x9cMissing Time\xe2\x80\x9d which usually happens after being abducted by aliens. What happens is you have gaps in your memory and you can't remember what happened to you or how you got somewhere. With that being said Thank you so much for watching, ladies and gentlemen.
