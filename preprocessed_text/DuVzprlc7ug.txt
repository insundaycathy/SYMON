Welcome to Cinema Summary, ladies and gentlemen. You know I like movies and telling you about them, but have you ever watched a movie and midway through you realize: it wasn't very good and it\xe2\x80\x99s actually boring? Yeah, this is one of those films, and I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna tell you all about it since its my job to explain and summarize movies but this time I\xe2\x80\x99m really gonna lash out and tell you how I really feel about this film so this is Kidnapping Stella, strap in folks as I strap on. The film has a promising start introducing us to our protagonists, Vic (the bearded one) and Tom (the twink), who we first see stealing a car in Berlin, before removing its license plates at a garage They then proceed to buy a lot of random items at a home improvement store. Stuff which they take to a grungy looking apartment in order to prepare it and I\xe2\x80\x99ll be honest with you, that start was pretty killer and it got me really hyped for the movie but let\xe2\x80\x99s just say that was basically the only interesting part of the movie: So anyways they start boarding up windows, sound proofing the walls, nailing the bed to the floor and adding a set of locks to keep people out. Giving each other a set of keys for the locks before heading out to the forest at night to nail a red cloth to a tree. As well as modifying their van with a few new additions before they wait in broad daylight for their target: Stella Martens. They put on their masks before grabbing her and putting her in their van, after which Tom takes the woman\xe2\x80\x99s phone, disconnecting the battery and the SIM card, allowing them to vanish. They then take her to the dingy 1 star apartment they rented, where Stella and us will be kept prisoner here for the rest of the film. Anyways, they lock her up, strip her, before taking photos of her. Putting her clothes in a bin liner before dressing her up like the Tethered from Us. Later, they demand that she give them her father\xe2\x80\x99s email address and phone number, and she gives it Then they go out, Tom putting Stella\xe2\x80\x99s phone in the garbage bag with her trashy clothes, while Vic uploads the photos to a computer before putting it on a thumb drive and leaving. As Tom goes in to check up on her, standing there like a freakazoid every ten minutes. He realizes he 's torn about this whole thing. When Vic comes back, he\xe2\x80\x99s brought back with him disposable phones, so after geting her some water they tell her that if she needs to pee or poo she should either stick 1 finger up or 2. She needs to go #1, so our delightful duo of kidnappers grab a plastic jug and help her out with Vic looking away and Tom staring intently at the pee jug After she\xe2\x80\x99s done, Tom dumps the bottle, and grabs some food but isn\xe2\x80\x99t hungry. Something that Vic gets on his case about since Tom needs his energy and after refusing to eat, Vic forces Tom to chew on a chicken nugget which he swallows but he\xe2\x80\x99s still not hungry due to the stress of the situation. This leads to a conversation between the two where we find out that Vic and Tom have been planning this for a long time ever since they were in prison. and they need to stick to the plan to get the ransom money and Vic leaves for some reason as Tom stays behind to check the photos of Stella, he\xe2\x80\x99s starting to feel a little guilty about this He goes in to check on her and is about to leave when she needs to go poo, so like a complete amateur he leaves the door open while he grabs a bucket and some toilet paper and brings it back along with a gun. After taking her out of her restraints, he makes her poop at gunpoint, which I know the feeling of but this isn\xe2\x80\x99t the time and place to talk about it. but she can\xe2\x80\x99t poop because of stage- but she can't poop because of stage fright and needs privacy so Tom turns around AGAIN LIKE A AMATEUR, gets hit with a bucket, dropping the gun which Stella grabs and threatens him with, demanding that he throw the key to her but he steps in and tries to grab the gun but she fires it. and Tom suffers from an episode of Tinnitus and as he's trying to recover Stella unmasks him and recognizes him. Why did you do this? You ruined my life! And Stella\xe2\x80\x99s so shocked that Tom is able to tackle her and lock her up again. and he leaves but not before telling her that if Vic finds out they know each other Vic will kill them both Speaking of the devil, Vic\xe2\x80\x99s back with bad news: Stella\xe2\x80\x99s dad won\xe2\x80\x99t send the money but Vic\xe2\x80\x99s sure that he will soon. and the next day, Tom films Stella and Vic as he\xe2\x80\x99s about to cut off Stella\xe2\x80\x99s pinky finger but as she\xe2\x80\x99s speaking into the camera, she mentions that she\xe2\x80\x99s 4 months pregnant. Tom says \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s enough\xe2\x80\x9d and they stop filming, and they have enough footage for a ransom video but Vic tells him NEVER to do that again. So Vic makes the ransom video and they prepare to go back inside but Vic notices Tom forgot his mask and he puts it on. and they go inside to feed her minestrone soup (Here comes the airplane) and during feeding time, Tom notices the bullet casing from earlier and tries to get it after the plastic spoon Vic was using falls to the ground and they leave the room With Tom going to the bathroom to flush the casing  down but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t go down and after a few more tries which gets Vic\xe2\x80\x99s attention, Tom grabs the casing with his fingers and no joke, swallows it. What a champ. After that ordeal and some mild sexual tension between Mr. Tomp and Bottom, Tom does some calculations and realizes that Stella is lying to him and confronts her and we find out a little bit about their history: at one point in the past they were dating, he was a criminal even before prison, he got her pregnant and then he went to jail and she realized that She didn\xe2\x80\x99t want someone like that in her life and left him. Although something interesting in their discussions that Vic learned of Stella after Tom mentioned her name as she fit the criteria of their ransom plan: single child, female, rich father. and although Tom doesn't believe her, Stella is adamant that she\xe2\x80\x99s pregnant and tells him that he can find out if he just turns on her phone to see her doctor appointments something that he realizes is just a trick so that the police can locate the phone. But then she begins to choke and when Tom goes to help her she throws up and they get close and begin to make out, but it\xe2\x80\x99s all a trick to get free so that she can handcuff Tom to the bedframe while she goes to call the police on a disposable phone but finds out she needs a key to unlock the door\xe2\x80\x99s locks. A key that slipped out of Tom\xe2\x80\x99s hands which is now on the floor of the hostage room, So Stella puts the phone in her pocket and lunges for the keys but Tom is able to knock her out and break the bed frame to get free and puts Stella back in her place As he goes to wash up the vomit, Vic comes back telling Tom that Stella\xe2\x80\x99s dad will deliver the 4 million euros at the coordinates. So they have to move her in the van to the boat house. and then they have moement where Vic confides with Tom that he's planning on going to Mexico to meet with a friend and go to the Pacific Ocean with the money and retire over there now it's not my place to stomp on someone's dreams but that is super clich\xc3\xa9 and that is a proud American tradition that I will not tolerate so you German criminals can go find your own Mexico either down in Poland or in Argentina Anyways, Tom goes to prep the van and finds a doctors note that proves Stella\xe2\x80\x99s pregnant while Vic talks with her and realizes that something\xe2\x80\x99s wrong: she has one of the disposable phones, knows Tom\xe2\x80\x99s name, and there\xe2\x80\x99s a bullet in the wall. Which I mean of all the things that could happen, he finds the exact place where the bullet was? Is that bad script writing or pure luck? and to make it worse, Stella reveals that she and Tom know each other. Looks like someone's going to die soon After prepping the van, Tom comes back and Vic is being weird. Checking that the gun is working, and talking about Stella and Tom in a vaguely threatening way before they move onto the next phase of the plan. Vic injects Stella with an anesthetic before he and Tom dump in her in the van, though Vic is on the phone for some reason. Did you send the coordinates? Ja, ja. Everything is gut. Do not worry young Tom! They drive the van to a boathouse where they lock Stella up and Vic changes the plan and brings Tom with him to pick up the money and just before they go into the forest Tom puts the battery back into Stella\xe2\x80\x99s phone before going to the tree with red cloth nailed into it the same tree from earlier but when he goes check the money SURPRISE! It\xe2\x80\x99s not there, tricky Vic tricked Tom! What a tweest! Then Vic prepares to execute Tom who begs Vic not to kill him and alludes to an intimate relationship they had back in prison before he runs away and gets shot. So Stella\xe2\x80\x99s still locked up, Tom is dead, and Vic\xe2\x80\x99s got the money and he drives back to that place we saw at the beginning of the film to switch cars before driving back to the boathouse to poison Stella but guess who comes to save the day! It\xe2\x80\x99s Tom! Shocking. Who hits Vic on the head with a stick before he is shot by Vic which leads to Vic getting killed after being tripped by Stella, causing him to drop his gun which Tom uses to take Vic out. The film ends with Stella freed, Tom and Vic are dead, and Stella escapes in the car Vic drove, taking the money that was used to pay for her ransom and disappearing.... to Poland And with that being said, thank you so much for watching ladies and gentlemen I realize this is a very different style of a video than I do usually and I hoped you enjoyed it, if you did leave a like down below and if otherwise... uh let me know with a comment down below, how I should improve, if you liked it, or if I should change or get rid of it and subscribe if you haven't already to get updated on my latest uploads
