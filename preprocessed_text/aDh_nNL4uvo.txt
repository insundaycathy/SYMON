[Music], grass, crops, trees, everything in this area is either dead or dying. and that's a radius of over 3 miles. and it all leads back to here. [Music], darkness from the upside down. we have to take him in a hopper. I agree. no, no way. well, you were right about these bumpkins, some nasty stuff. but we'll run the tests and we'll see what comes up. I gotta go to school, but I'll be back soon. so this thing, this shadow thing you told your mama likes it like this and likes it cold. I don't have to think. I just know things now - they're growing. ready. you see why I have to stop the truth from spreading to those weeds there, by whatever means necessary, we connect its roots. cuz remember he was saying it was spreading and him, kill him. so they were killing vines. [Music]. doesn't really matter. the point is, mistakes happen. hopper, I think he's in trouble. I think he's going to die. I want to see mama. just stuck. they think like gonna dream. the tape recording. is it enough? it's is that incriminating? so I'll be took yesterday. okay. it's a map. it's a map of Hawkins. [Music]. [Applause]. [Music], to taking down the man. start grew again. he escaped, and I'm pretty sure he's a baby. Gemma Corrigan, wait what? I'll explain later. just meet me and Steve at the old junkyard. it's been spreading, growing beneath us like some cancer. it has some sort of a hive intelligence, and it's connecting all the hosts. [Applause]. they're going somewhere. there are lives here. [Music], what is your name? Jay bounced me with only this sunny means she can find people without moving. there's nothing but an image. these are the Batman, as you call them, the ones they believe are still alive. your mother, do you remember us? I can help you find it. find her. Brenner, I can take you to him, please. Jay, get it. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but I have to go back my friends. my friends are in danger. it's polycarbonate. I can't get through. we need to make real sleep. what he's a spy if he knows where we are. source, the shadow was lying. he killed those soldiers. don't kill us - oh, my god. you're looking for Mike and will. they're not in there, are they? why? if we stop him, we could stop his army. to the shadow Monica, Wells a day in the field. the doctor said it was like a virus. it infected mister. this virus is connecting him to the tunnel. so the tunnels to the monsters to be upside down. everything, whoa slow down. slow down. if anyone knows how to destroy this thing. it's will. he's connected to. he knows, he knows where we are. [Music], do you think your fee? we got you back there. they you could close it. I can do it. even if L can, there's still another problem. closing the gate will kill him. so if he likes it cool, we need to burn it out of him. maybe if we set this on fire. no, yeah, that's a no mind. flayer would call away his army. they'd all come to stop. but then we circle back to the exit. by the time they realize were gone, L may be at the gate, close it.
