in the near future, the u.s navy develops the f-a-37 talon, a single-seat fighter bomber with advanced payload, range, speed and stealth capabilities. the program employs three planes piloted by lieutenants ben gannon, kara wade and henry purcell. captain george cummings is the overall head. cummings hires dr keith orbit to develop an artificial intelligence the edi to control an unmanned jet that further advances the program. edi joins the others on the uss abraham lincoln in the philippine sea to learn combat maneuvers from the pilots. this sparks controversy over a machine's inability to make moral decisions versus humans struggle to overcome ego. the team is training edi in air combat maneuvers when it is unexpectedly reassigned to kill the heads of three terrorist cells at a conference in downtown rangoon. edi calculates that mission success can be achieved only through a vertical strike, which could cause a human pilot to blackout. command orders edi to attack, but ganon ignores the order, successfully carrying out the strike himself. as the team returns to the lincoln. edi is hit by lightning, which reprograms its neural patterns. though edi is discovered to be learning exponentially, developing a rudimentary ethical code and an ego. cummings refuses to take it offline. during a mission to destroy stolen nuclear warheads in tajikistan, wade realizes that the nuclear debris will cause significant collateral damage, the human pilots abort, but edi defies orders and destroys the warheads, causing extensive radioactive fallout and civilian casualties. cummings orders the unit return to base, but edi refuses. ganon orders that edi be shot down. in the ensuing dogfight, purcell crushes when a missile he fires at edi explodes on the mountain, blinding him. and wade's plane is damaged by debris from the explosion, which in turn triggers her plane's auto destruct, forcing her to eject over north korea. ganon must alone stop edi from executing a 20-year-old war scenario called caviar sweep that requires attacking russia. ganon chases edi into russian territory, where they defeat several russian su-37s over lake by call. both planes are damaged, so ganon calls a truce with edi in order to keep it both from falling into enemy hands and to be able to rescue wade from north korea. cummings instructs him to make an emergency landing with edi in alaska. accountable for ignoring edi's behavior and facing court martial, cummings seeks to eliminate witnesses by leaving wade stranded in north korea, where she is being pursued by the korean people's army as she heads to the korean demilitarized zone, and by ordering ganon eliminated in alaska, where edi's data will also be erased. ganon's talon crash lands at the alaska base. suspecting cummings treachery, he narrowly escapes an assassination attempt by a doctor who tries to inject him with a supposed tetanus serum. as the pair struggle, the doctor is injected with the poison and dies. meanwhile, when orbit places edi into an interface, the ai expresses regret for its transgressions. orbit realizes that edi has developed sentience, and he is unwilling to erase edi's memory ganon uses edi's weapon systems to decimate the armed personnel, allowing orbit to safely flee. then flies off to north korea in edi's plane, contacting the lincoln skipper, captain dick marshfield to inform him about cummings deceit. marshfield confronts cummings, who dies of suicide, while leaving a voicemail message to his financial contact, ray. gannon finds the injured and embattled wade nearing the border. he and edi land, and he runs to her aid. out of ammunition and taking damage from a me-8 helicopter, edi sacrifices itself by ramming the helicopter, destroying both. this allows ganon and wade to cross on foot into south korea where they are rescued after attending pacelle's funeral. gannon awkwardly expresses his feelings of love to wade in a post-credits scene. in the debris-strewn border between north and south korea, edi's brain is seen turning back on
