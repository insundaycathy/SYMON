With the final Season 7 of Game of Thrones soon upon us let\xe2\x80\x99s take a quick look back and recap the incredible journey that some of our most beloved characters have been on since the first season when it aired in 2011! My God they were so young! Just in case you\xe2\x80\x99ve been living under a rock somewhere, Game of Thrones is a HBO TV series based off the A Song of Ice and Fire books written by George RR Martin. In a nutshell it\xe2\x80\x99s a medieval style fantasy drama with lots of boobs and murder (probably gonna have to skip the boobs though to make it Youtube safe) where different families vie for power over the kingdom of Westeros. Also there used to be all sorts of magic and dragons about 300 years ago but things have been pretty standard traditional since then. Lets Go! In the far far north where its real cold, soldiers of the Night\xe2\x80\x99s Watch, come across a gruesome scene of murder and encounter the living dead along with supernatural creature called a White Walker \xe2\x80\x93 Regarded as Little more than legend and tales to frighten children this is pretty bad news, so this guy deserts and heads South of the wall. \xe2\x80\xa6Where he\xe2\x80\x99s immediately captured by the men of Winterfell (also still in the North) and beheaded as a deserter from the Night\xe2\x80\x99s Watch. The warden of the North and the guy in charge round here is Ned Stark, he\xe2\x80\x99s basically a real solid guy who follows the rules and takes responsibility but is oblivious to this incredible threat from beyond the wall because he\xe2\x80\x99s too busy dealing with his family. Him and his wife Catelyn have 5 kids, Robb the eldest and Heir to Winterfell, Sansa who likes cakes and sewing, Bran who loves to climb stuff, Arya who\xe2\x80\x99s the Tomby and Rickon who\xe2\x80\x99s not really important. Oddly despite being such an upstanding bloke Ned also has a bastard son called Jon Snow who Catelyn hates even though he\xe2\x80\x99s a good kid. Also Ned\xe2\x80\x99s in charge of looking after another lad called Theon Greyjoy. He\xe2\x80\x99s a real prick. Now don\xe2\x80\x99t worry if they all look the same and you can\xe2\x80\x99t tell them apart it\xe2\x80\x99s not that important just yet. Out and about they find the corpse of a Stagg and a Direwolf with a litter of 6 living pups that are adopted by each child, with Jon getting the albino quiet one. Meanwhile down in Kings landing the hand of the king, i.e. the guy that does the actual work has died, and so King Robert Baratheon travels up to Winterfell to offer the position to his old brother in arms Ned. He brings his Queen and her family along who are all a bunch of Lannisters. The Queen\xe2\x80\x99s twin brother Ser Jaime, her other brother Lord Tyrion, Her Kids Prince Joffrey and young Myrcella and Tommen, some a more complex but for now you can just assume they\xe2\x80\x99re all a bunch of assholes except Tyrion. To make things worse Catelyn\xe2\x80\x99s sister Lysa was married to the former hand of the king, and she receives a letter basically saying he was poisoned by the Lannisters. But no proof for now so with a few snide remarks everyone plays nice over dinner and most of them go out hunting together the next day. We\xe2\x80\x99re gonna come to back that. Now across the narrow sea there is a completely separate story going on. You see King Robert took the throne from the Mad King Aerys Targaryen, and two of his kids are kind of on the run in exile. Cruel Viserys and his uber hot sister Daenerys. I can say that about the show version because the actress is over 18, in the books it\xe2\x80\x99s not cool. Basically Viserys is gonna marry Dany off to a savage warlord king called Khal Drogo, all of which is made possible by this rich merchant called Magister Illyrio, so that they might take advantage of Drogo\xe2\x80\x99s huge mounted army in the future and retake the Crown in Westeros. Dany\xe2\x80\x99s wedding gift include some fossilised dragon eggs and when she gets married she\xe2\x80\x99s pretty much terrified of this new culture which makes this seem horribly rapey. Right so back over in Westeros up at Winterfell most of the 2 families, the Starks and the Lannisters are out hunting but Brandon stays at home to climb stuff because it\xe2\x80\x99s his favourite thing to do. But unfortunately it turns out that when nobody\xe2\x80\x99s about, Queen Cersei and her brother Jamie like to bang each other! Bran sees everything. Jamie decides to keep the incest secret by pushing Bran out the window but the kid doesn\xe2\x80\x99t die, he just goes into a coma. Everyone is real sad about this apparent climbing accident although Tyrion does have to forcibly convince Prince Joffrey to not be shit and go offer his sympathies. And Cersei and Jamie feel super awkward about the idea that Bran might yet live. Ned Sansa, Arya and his guard are heading South with the King to join him as the Hand in King\xe2\x80\x99s Landing, while Catelyn stays to look after Bran and Rickon with Robb put in charge. Jon can\xe2\x80\x99t go so instead he decides to head North with his uncle Benjin and join the Night\xe2\x80\x99s Watch on the wall to defend the realm from wildlings. Jamie gives him some shit for this but he\xe2\x80\x99s really only telling it how it is, and Tyrion decides not to join the rest of the Lannisters down South immediately, but go take a look at the wall himself on a tourist visa. Jon gives his favourite sister Arya a small sword called Needle and says bye to Bran despite Catelyn\xe2\x80\x99s frosty reception. He asks Ned about his real mystery mother but Ned promises to talk about that next time they meet. Ooo Yikes. On the road North Tyrion gives Jon some good advice on seeing things how they really are because the Night\xe2\x80\x99s Watch is also made up of criminals given a second chance on the Wall and its gonna be a hard life. Blimey although the view should be pretty good. Back at Winterfell an assassin turns up to finish off Bran but his Direwolf protects the boy and kills him. Catelyn is now totally pro-wolf and the Starks deduce that Bran must have seen something in the tower that nearly cost him his life. The assassin\xe2\x80\x99s knife is a high quality Valyrian steel blade and seems to lead back to the Lannisters, so Catelyn decides to travel incognito to King\xe2\x80\x99s Landing to warn Ned. Speaking of which, as the King\xe2\x80\x99s party make their slow way back down it becomes apparent that sweet prince Joffrey really is a piece of shit who bullies a common boy to show off and after taking a knock ends up in a rage swinging at Arya, threatening to gut her. Nymeria her Direwolf thinks otherwise of the situation but the problem is that you can\xe2\x80\x99t bite a Prince these days without consequences. Later that night Joff lies to everybody about how it all went down and Sansa, who just wants everything to be nice and pretty keeps quiet and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t back up Arya\xe2\x80\x99s version of events. Cersei demands the wolf dead but Arya already made Nymeria run away so Cersei makes Ned kill Sansa\xe2\x80\x99s wolf instead! What the fuck! Also that common boy gets slaughtered by the Prince\xe2\x80\x99s own bodyguard, the Hound, but we\xe2\x80\x99re more sad about the wolf. Heading out from Pentos over in the Grass sea, Dany seems to take strength from her stone dragon eggs whilst\xe2\x80\xa6God that\xe2\x80\x99s not okay come on! And as the Khalasar army journeys about, Viserys and her are joined by a banished Western Knight called Ser Jorah Mormont. Dany starts to learn the language a bit and has a bedslave teach her ways of lovemaking to help her relationship with Drogo. This actually works and she starts to feel a bit better about things when she\xe2\x80\x99s on top. Ned arrives at King\xe2\x80\x99s Landing and Jamie reminds him that the King Shits and the Hand wipes, Ned returns by bringing up the fact Jaime is the Kingslayer, the guy who stabbed the old mad King when he should have been protecting him, and so Jamie adds that this is the very spot where the previous mad King had Ned\xe2\x80\x99s father and brother horribly killed. So in the context Kingslaying really wasn\xe2\x80\x99t such a dick move after all. Then he gets a crash course in bureaucracy with the small council, Lord Petyr Baelish master of coin, Grand Maester Pycelle, Lord Renly Baratheon the King\xe2\x80\x99s younger brother and Varys, the master of whispers. So it turns out the King has been spending extravagantly like a madman and the crown is in big debt. Cersei gives horrible advice to her horrible son and tells him he must marry Sansa to lock down the North legitimately but can do whatever he wants otherwise. Because everybody that\xe2\x80\x99s not us, is our enemy. And meanwhile Sansa and Arya still aren\xe2\x80\x99t getting on so Ned reminds Arya that they need to stick together when they are surrounded by danger. He also gets her a swordmaster to teach her the Water Dance style and this guy Syrio Forel is quite the character. King Robert can be pretty mean guy when drinking and even he reminds Jamie about killing the previous King despite it stopping Aerys burning down the city. But never doubt Jaime can fight and he does have the respect of some of the other Kingsguard too. Much to her surprise Littlefinger meets Catelyn as she enters the city low-key to meet Ned because they used to be old friends back when they were kids. Varys knows all the secrets it seems but it\xe2\x80\x99s Littlefinger that claims the dagger meant to kill Bran belonged to Tyrion Lannister. Who by the way is enjoying his lovely visit to the wall which is run by Commander Mormont (Jorah\xe2\x80\x99s ded), a great deal more than Jon Snow is, who\xe2\x80\x99s pretty much getting hazed solid by his instructor. And so even Tyrion has to step in to stop a beat down before reminding Jon that they haven\xe2\x80\x99t all had his upbringing and that everybody might want to get along instead. And much to their credit they all seem to take his advice. Benjen reminds Tyrion that it\xe2\x80\x99s not the Wildlings North of the wall that he and his rangers fear, it\xe2\x80\x99s the threat of other darker things, but Tyrion doesn\xe2\x80\x99t buy it even when Maester Aemon and the commander becry the need of the Night\xe2\x80\x99s Watch for more trained men and support. So Tyrion takes a midnight piss from the top of the Wall because YOLO and leaves back for the South having earned Jon\xe2\x80\x99s respect. Bran wakes from his coma and can\xe2\x80\x99t use his legs anymore, but he also can\xe2\x80\x99t remember what happened so for now he just has to listen to old Nan\xe2\x80\x99s stories about fear and Whitewalkers and the Long Night when Kings were frozen in their castles. While over in the Khalasarr as they head for Vaes Dothrak, Jorah tells Dany that Khals are often given slaves from big cities as gifts in order to stop the cities from actually getting plundered and Dany orders everybody to stop so she can think on this and take a walk. Her stupid cruel brother Viserys flies off the handle at her for being given an order when he\xe2\x80\x99s the King to be, and looses a lot of credit with the rest of the crowd, even with Jorah. You see unlike this dick, Dany is doing her best to learn the language and embrace the culture, and Ser Jorah is a travelled man who has earned the respect of the Dothraki, but once he hears news that Dany is pregnant, he suddenly has to leave for Qohor without explanation. Bran starts having weird dreams where he\xe2\x80\x99s pestered by a 3 eyed raven, but has to get carried down to the Hall to say hi to Tryion and Yoren of the Night\xe2\x80\x99s Watch as they pass through Winterfell en route to King\xe2\x80\x99s Landing. Robb gives him a frosty reception but Tryion draws up plans for a special saddle that can allow Bran to still ride a horse. On his way out Tryion stops to give Theon a load of shit for essentially being a Greyjoy hostage and a Stark lackey before he goes off to get laid. On the Wall there\xe2\x80\x99s a fat new recruit Sam Tarley the coward, but Jon\xe2\x80\x99s not into hazing the new kids anymore and on the Wall itself Sam explains he\xe2\x80\x99s always been craven to the point that his own dad threatened to have him killed if he didn\xe2\x80\x99t join the Night\xe2\x80\x99s Watch. And although some of the rougher new recruits still need reminding that it\xe2\x80\x99s not cool to bully each other anymore, the point seems to get across. Viserys and Dany reach Vaes Dothrack, The horselord city, where Viserys talks shit and goes on about how this is all his army. Jorah tells Dany that if the Dothraki ever made it to Westeros they could fight King Robert in the field but aren\xe2\x80\x99t very good at sieges against castles. Viserys talks big to the bed slave about Dragons forging the Iron Throne, while she mentions seeing weird things like pirates and people who can change their faces (Ooo we\xe2\x80\x99re gonna get back to that later) But Viserys spoils the mood and he then decides to go beat on Dany a bit for basically giving him gifts! But she\xe2\x80\x99s finally had enough of his shit and slaps him one telling him to back off. So Jorah and Dany call it as it is, Old V-dog is not fit to rule and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t lead the Dothraki army even if they were given to him. Back In the throne room Sansa is still pretty raw about Ned killing her Direwolf but Ned is even less happy as he struggles with the small council and their bureaucratic B.S. He enquires after the death of the last hand Jon Arryn and looks into the book he was studying before his suspicious sudden illness. Littlefinger explains to Ned that everyone has spies everywhere, and hints that Ned is onto something and offers up further information. But he does also warn Ned that distrusting him was the wisest thing he\xe2\x80\x99d done so far. So Ned checks on a Smith\xe2\x80\x99s apprentice called Gendry who Jon Arryn had also spoken to, and it looks like the former Hand had been taking an interest in all of King Robert\xe2\x80\x99s bastard children. There\xe2\x80\x99s a tourney being set up to celebrate Ned\xe2\x80\x99s new position by command of the King, and Littlefinger dials up the creepy to perv on Sansa for a bit, but one of the guys Ned wanted to question in relation to John Arryn\xe2\x80\x99s death is \xe2\x80\x98accidentally\xe2\x80\x99 killed by Ser Gregor Clegane, this dude is the Mountain that rides. He\xe2\x80\x99s massive and dangerous and the older brother of the Hound. Things spice up at the inn where Catelyn heading back up North comes across Tyrion heading back down south, and on suspicion of trying to have Bran murdered she has him taken hostage by a mixed bag of local men loyal to the Starks. Tyrion\xe2\x80\x99s all like- what? Day two of the tourney and Ser Loras Tyrell gives Sansa a rose even though she\xe2\x80\x99s packing the wrong type of junk for his liking, and he then jousts against the Mountain who loses due to his horse getting the scent of a mare. But this guy is mental. So he cuts off his horses head, and then throws a beat-down on the Knight of Flowers until his brother the Hound jumps in to stop him. These guys have beef, and it was Ser Gregor who burned the Hound\xe2\x80\x99s face as a kid. The Mountain storms off but Ser Loras praises the Hound and he clearly doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know how to feel about being the good guy for once. Loras later tells Renly that maybe he should be the next King while they get it on, and Rob and Cersei both agree they hate each other and that their 17 years of marriage has been miserable. Meanwhile Catelyn\xe2\x80\x99s mixed group of random knights and sellswords are taking Tyrion over to her syster Lysa in the Vale to be tried. Tyrion mentions that Lysa is a bit weird these days but they\xe2\x80\x99re suddenly attacked by wild mountain clansmen. Instead of making a run for it he helps defend Catelyn and it also turns out one of the sellswords travelling with them is one hell of a killer. So they just about reach the Vale and yeah Lysa is pretty weird breastfeeding a son way too old for it ah that\xe2\x80\x99s gross! And they slap Tyrion in one of the sky cells Down South Varys confides in Ned that Jon Arryn was poisoned, administered by the page who then got knighted and killed, but doesn\xe2\x80\x99t say on who\xe2\x80\x99s orders. Looks like the former Hand had started asking the wrong questions. But Varys\xe2\x80\x99 motives are clouded. Because Arya is off chasing cats as part of her sword training and she ends up in an old part of the castle with dragon skulls and overhears and Varys and Magister Illyrio - Talking about the imminent war between Starks and Lannisters, but that it\xe2\x80\x99s happening all too soon For Drogo\xe2\x80\x99s army and the Targaryen kids to make use of it. Then Littlefinger and Varys have a who knows more secrets than who showdown, and it\xe2\x80\x99s casually interrupted by Renly because Robert is fuming. He\xe2\x80\x99s just heard that Dany is now pregnant and could be a threat to his kingdom, and it turns out Ser Jorah has been feeding the crown information in hopes of a pardon for his own crime of selling slaves. Ned thinks child murder is a dick move but Robert really hates Targaryens and the council agree that the girl should die for the sake of the greater good. Ned quits and is on his way out, but Jaime has gotten wind of Catelyn kidnapping his brother, so he steps up and kills Ned\xe2\x80\x99s number 2 guy and oh shit - It\xe2\x80\x99s on! These two are both powerful swordsmen going at it but then this random prick sStabs Ned in the leg and spoils the moment for Jaime. So Jamie has left the capitol and Ned\xe2\x80\x99s in bed with a broken leg and the King demands Tyrion\xe2\x80\x99s release before things get worse. He reinstates Ned back as the Hand and goes off hunting to clear his mind \xe2\x80\x93 while he\xe2\x80\x99s out there though his Lannister squire is making sure that he stays suspiciously drunk. In Bran\xe2\x80\x99s dreams the three-eyed raven seems to want to show him something but Hodor, the big dumb friendly houseboy who can only say his own name -asterisk, turns up with that special saddle so he goes off into the woods for a ride with Robb and Theon. Theon tries to convince Robb to go to war with the Lannisters but bran is accosted by wildlings who try to steal his horse. Stark fights and Greyjoy shoots killing all but one who they take as a prisoner. Up in the Vale in the castle Eyrie Tyrion talks his way out of the cell to stand before an audience and demand trial by combat in response to the allegations. In a hall surrounded by enemies everybody\xe2\x80\x99s up for killing a dwarf, But Tyrion\xe2\x80\x99s risky bet pays off when the sellsword who was travelling with them steps up for sake of Lannister gold. This guy Bronn is a mean lean killing machine and wears down Lysa\xe2\x80\x99s champion before the kill. The two of them say their goodbyes and start the dangerous journey home. In the sacred city of Vaes Dothrak, Dany is really getting into the idea of heating up those stone dragon eggs and realises that as a Targaryen she\xe2\x80\x99s kinda immune to fire. She then eats a whole horse\xe2\x80\x99s heart in ritual to prove the worth her unborn son. Who the witches now claim will be the stallion that mounts the world. Viserys gets super jelly and tries to sell her Dragon eggs to buy another army. Jorah says no, so instead he gets really drunk, demands that Khal Drogo win him the crown he was promised and threatens Dany\xe2\x80\x99s unborn baby. This doesn\xe2\x80\x99t go down so well so Drogo gives him a crown molten gold right then and there. It seems that since leaving King\xe2\x80\x99s Landing the Mountain has been raping and pillaging the Riverlands with his men, and the smallfolk seek justice from Ned while the King is away. Ned sends Lord Beric Dondarrion and a force of men to bring him to justice, but he knows that it\xe2\x80\x99s probably head of House Lannister, Lord Tywin who\xe2\x80\x99s really giving the orders. Joffrey plays the charming card on Sansa who laps it up and promises she will be queen someday. But sensing danger and impending war Ned tells his girls they\xe2\x80\x99re going home. Sansa blurts out about wanting golden haired children with Joffrey and the penny drops. That book Jon Arryn was reading was all about Baratheon lineage, describing black hair every time just like Gendry and the King\xe2\x80\x99s other bastards. Looks like these Lannister gold children are not the King\xe2\x80\x99s own blood after all. In the field Lord Tywin Lannister gives his son Jamie grief for leaving Ned alive, but also gives him command of half of their forces in the upcoming war, as family name is everything to Tywin. Stupid old honourable Ned tells Cersei that he knows about her incest children and that King Robert will go berserk when he\xe2\x80\x99s back from the hunt. Instead of fleeing the city however the Queen is just like yeah so what, I play the game of thrones to win or die. On the wall they\xe2\x80\x99ve passed their training. So the new recruits say their vows in front of a heart tree and become Brothers of the Night\xe2\x80\x99s Watch. But instead of being made a ranger John is made a steward to the Lord Commander. He really wanted to scout beyond the wall because Jon\xe2\x80\x99s Uncle Benjen is missing now from a Northern ranging, with only his horse returning. But Sam tells him to wise up and realise he\xe2\x80\x99s likely being groomed for command. Once their vows are done though his direwolf Ghost finds the dead bodies of two other Black Brothers who also went out with Benjen. On their travels the Khalsar visits a market, and Jorah in secret receives his pardon from the crown. But he\xe2\x80\x99s really into Dany by now and despite being a spy doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want her dead. So when a suspicious travelling merchant offers Dany a cask of poisoned wine, Jorah makes him take a sip of it first, saving her life. And oddly it\xe2\x80\x99s this very assassination attempt that angers Drogo enough to finally turn his wandering army around and head back towards Westeros to take the crown in revenge. Robert is back from the hunt, but he was so drunk that he got mortally wounded by a boar and now he\xe2\x80\x99s dying. He decrees that Ned be in charge of the Kingdom when he\xe2\x80\x99s gone until Prince Joffrey comes of age. On a technicality Ned actually writes down \xe2\x80\x98rightful heir\xe2\x80\x99 instead of Joffrey and Ser Bariston Selmy, commander of the Kingsguard laments not protecting the king. Renly advises Ned to make a move against Cersei immediately. But Ned is stubborn and all about the rules and knows that Stannis, Renly\xe2\x80\x99s older and oddly absent brother is next in line as King. So he sends word to Dragonstone to tell Stannis it\xe2\x80\x99s time to step up. Everyone tells Ned he\xe2\x80\x99s being na\xc3\xafve, and Ned mentions that the royal children are bastards, and that he needs Littlefinger\xe2\x80\x99s help in making sure the City Guard are on his side when the shit goes down. Problem - Littlefinger still fancies Catelyn and holds a grudge against the Starks since the days of his childhood, a guy like him can\xe2\x80\x99t win by the rules of swords, but can win by screwing over people with commerce and politics, so he agrees to have Ned\xe2\x80\x99s back - But when the time comes and Ned and his men step into the throne room to declare Joffrey a bastard without claim, the City Guard turn around and kill his own men, with Ned being taken prisoner. So things didn\xe2\x80\x99t really go down as planned. Across the capitol Lannisters are suddenly Killing Starks, and Sansa runs for her room where she\xe2\x80\x99s caught by the Hound. Arya is in the middle of a sword fighting lesson however and Syrio Forel isn\xe2\x80\x99t convinced about handing her over. So he gives her his final lesson and sweeps up the trash before sacrificing himself. Like if you cry every time. In the chaos and turmoil, Arya grabs Needle, kills a stable-boy and escapes the castle into the city by a secret passage she found when chasing cats. Ned\xe2\x80\x99s slapped in the black cells and all his men are dead. And In a dick move Cersei and the new King dismiss the Barriston Selmy from the Kingsguard, and he\xe2\x80\x99s not impressed. Renly too has fled the capitol, but Cersei and the rest of the small council coheres Sansa into writing a letter to Robb telling him to come down and swear loyalty to King Joffrey. Robb\xe2\x80\x99s gonna come South alright, but he\xe2\x80\x99s going to take the armies of the North with him. He callshis banners of the North together and Greatjon Umber takes a little bit of convincing to follow the young Lord, but after a wolf bite or two becomes Robb\xe2\x80\x99s staunchest supporter. So he goes to war technically leaving Bran in charge at Winterfell. Their wildling captive Osha, has kind of fallen into place working round the castle and talks to Bran about truths and hearing the old gods and the winter threat beyond the wall. In the Castle Eyrie Catelyn is unhappy that Lysa won\xe2\x80\x99t back her up with the knights of the Vale if the Starks go to war. She seems to fear conflict with the Lannisters and is essentially useless. And mean whilst heading home from there, Tyrion and Bronn are accosted by the same mountain clansmen who gave them grief on the way in, but Tyrion\xe2\x80\x99s power is his wit and his words and he manages to talk them into escorting them safely back to the Lannister army, promising them the weapons that they need to take the Vale for themselves. Because screw those guys. On the Wall there\xe2\x80\x99s something odd about those ranger corpses found near the Heart Tree. The odd thing being that they\xe2\x80\x99re actually undead. They rise up in the middle of the night and attack Jon and the Lord Commander. They don\xe2\x80\x99t die by traditional means but they do thankfully burn well. Across the sea Drogo\xe2\x80\x99s Khalasar is on the warpath now, and heading back West, and it\xe2\x80\x99s raping and pillaging and taking slaves to sell on to pay for ships. Dany doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like the cruel truth of this and puts a stop to the raping by claiming all of the women. Drogo is amused but some of his men aren\xe2\x80\x99t, so he kills this mug and takes a wound that one of the spared women, a healer by trade, offers to patch up in gratitude to Dany. Catelyn meets up with Robb\xe2\x80\x99s army in the Riverlands planning for war, and Tyrion meets up with Tywin\xe2\x80\x99s army to say hi to his dad and uncle, bringing the mountain clansmen along with him. Tywin never misses an opportunity and gets the clansman to fight for him alongside Tyrion in the upcoming battle. Robb is marching South but needs to cross the river at The Twins. This place is owned by the vulture Walder Frey, who is technically on their side but really only looks out for himself. He agrees to the crossing and joining the war but only so long as Robb marries one of his many daughters. A shit deal for Robb but off they cross in full force. For protecting him against zombies the Lord Commander gives Jon with his Valyrian steel sword, but Jon finds out about his brother going to war for his father and wants to desert and help. Thankfully his other new brothers of the watch convince him to stay and follow duty. And it turns out Maester Aemon was in fact Targaryen Royalty who also chose the hard path of remaining on the Wall. Tyrion and the tribesmen are going in the front lines and it seems that Tywin isn\xe2\x80\x99t too worried about Tyrion\xe2\x80\x99s survival in general which kills his appetite. It comes back pretty quickly though as Bronn has found him a cheeky little whore called Shae who has a quick wit to match his. But beware like Bronn the sellsword this is very much a business situation for her. Next day they join the battle. Tyrion gets knocked out pretty early but it turns out they won. But this is because it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the full Stark army heading down to fight but just 1/10th of the force as a diversion. Robb had led the rest of the force in a surprise attack that took Jamie Lannister\xe2\x80\x99s force and the Kingslayer himself captive. Turns out that despite being treated Drogo\xe2\x80\x99s wound did not heal at all and has in fact festered. He falls from his horse, and it\xe2\x80\x99s too late even for the healer to help him now. She does further mention however that she\xe2\x80\x99s also trained in blood magic as a Magei. Desperate, Dany consents to some dark sacrifice shit and this really splits the crowd forcing Jorah to Kill a Bloodrider while Dany suddenly goes into premature labour. Jorah unwisely takes her to the Magei for further help. In the black cells Ned wants to stick to the honourable truth but Varys convinces him to recant his accusations against Joffrey because making sure that his children aren\xe2\x80\x99t harmed is a kind of honourable thing to do too. So Ned aggress to say he was wrong for the sake of family. Arya is living like a hobo in the city and joins the crowd to see Ned, Cersei and the King put on a show, with Ned as the traitor villain. He spies his daughter and manages to put Yoren on to her in passing and Cersei and co. promise Sansa that they\xe2\x80\x99ll let Ned live for his confession and join the Nights Watch. But Joffrey is cruel to the core and demands his head anyway. Yoren makes Arya look away when it happens, and everyone including us come to realise that anyone can die in this show. Yoren is rough but his gameplan is to pretend Arya is a boy entering the Night\xe2\x80\x99s Watch and to sneak her back to Winterfell. \xe2\x80\x98Arry\xe2\x80\x99 will be travelling up with the other criminals but Gendry has been sent to join the watch too. In Bran\xe2\x80\x99s dream the three-eyed raven leads to the crypts, so he real life heads down with Osha and talks of dreaming of Ned being there. Seems Rickon had the same dream too, before Maester Luwin receives official word of his death. Catelyn and Robb also grieve at the loss of Ned, swearing vengeance on the Lannisters. But Catelyn wants to make sure Sansa and Arya are back safe too. Word on the street is that Renly is now also now laying claim to the throne, ahead of his older brother Stannis. But while they\xe2\x80\x99re all together the Northern Lords suggest Robb might as well be King of North, essentially breaking Westeros into two kingdoms. In captivity Jamie admits pushing Bran out the window but doesn\xe2\x80\x99t say exactly why. Tywin and his war council talk of how both Baratheon brothers are now claiming the throne as next in line, and Tyrion adds that all chances of peace with the North (who are now winning), were ruined when Joff decided to kill Ned. Tywin tells Tyrion that he might have underestimated his other son and that he\xe2\x80\x99s sending him to King\xe2\x80\x99s Landing as Hand of the king to basically run things and keep Joffrey and Cersei in line. But adds he\xe2\x80\x99s not allowed to take his whore along with him, because these some bad history there. But screw that- Tyrion is gonna take her anyway. In the capitol we get an odd insight into Grand Maester Pycelle not truly being as old and doddering as he might appear. And another moment between Varys and Littlefinger, they both separately seem to be orchestrating some big secret schemes. Meanwhile Joffrey is having fun cutting off people\xe2\x80\x99s tongues, but stops for a moment to force Sansa to come and take a look at the severed head of her father. Mother says he\xe2\x80\x99s still to marry Sansa and shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hit her. So he has the Kingsguard hit her instead. It looks like she\xe2\x80\x99s about to push Joffrey off the ledge but the Hound intervenes making it seem to tend to her cut. Commander Mormont reports of talk of the wildlings North of the wall forming a massive army, and even more tell of the dead walking. This shit is far more important than Kings going to war, so he announces he\xe2\x80\x99s leading the Night\xe2\x80\x99s Watch North into wildling territory to discover what\xe2\x80\x99s going on. Dany wakes from the awful night and Jorah tells her she lost the child. The Magei adding that it was born monstrous and twisted, a lizard boy full of grey worms. This was the price of death to pay for Drogo\xe2\x80\x99s life. But it gets worse, all of the Khalasar army except the stragglers have left, and Drogo is technically alive but otherwise braindead and sightless. The sorceress admits that this was all part of her plan to stop Dany\xe2\x80\x99s child being the Stallion that mounts the world, and saving countless people from future war. So Dany in tears puts Drogo out of his misery and builds a pyre to burn the body along with the Sorceress, her eggs and herself. Jorah pleads for her not to commit suicide, but that\xe2\x80\x99s not actually Dany\xe2\x80\x99s plan. Through the fires of sacrifice she emerges unscathed, her eggs all hatched, and surrounded by three Dragons. Oh my God! So Ned\xe2\x80\x99s dead, the North is at war with the South, and as well as Stark V Lannister Robert\xe2\x80\x99s two other brothers are somewhere claiming the throne as well. Joffrey rules with cruelty keeping Sansa hostage, and Tyrion heading over for damage limitation. Jamie is captured and Arya is pretending to be a boy amongst criminals. While Jon is marching North of the wall and thanks to Dany, Dragons live once again.
