Sark also gives Peter back his suit which Aunt May walks in just as he's putting on discovering Peters superhero identity in a mid credit scene we see Toombs in prison being questioned about spider-man's real identity but tooms denies knowing anything about his secret get started let's do a quick rundown of the Avengers team Tony Stark aka Iron Man he's a billionaire genius that has no actual powers but incredibly advanced technology that helps him fight bad guys Thor aka pretty boy from Asgard the god of thunder who carries a hammer that cannot be moved Bruce Banner aka the Hulk a scientist that when he gets angry becomes a massive green creature that is nearly invincible Steve Rogers aka Captain America a genetically enhanced man from the 1940s that was frozen for 70 years and is sometimes a bit of out of touch with modern times Clint Barton aka Hawkeye a new character to the modern Marvel movie universe who does not have his own individual movie and frankly no one really cares about him Paul Kai's weapon of choice is a bow and arrow but does not have any real specific superpowers Natasha Romanoff aka Black Widow honestly safer maybe pretty boy Thor she's the best looking member of the Avengers she also does not have her own movie but I definitely watch it if she did she's a highly trained former Soviet spy who is a master assassin and seductress Nick Fury while not an actual Avenger he's the director of shield an organization that is sort of like a souped-up CIA that sometimes uses superheroes the avengers work as a part of shield now that we've explained who is part of the team let's get to the story the movie begins with Thor's not-so-nice brother Loki Loki meets a character called the other who is the leader of an alien race known as the Chitauri if Loki gets an object called the tesseract from shield and gives it to the other the other will give Loki an army capable of taking over earth the tesseract has been Sene and quite a few other Marvel movies especially in the first Captain America movie I will be doing a summary of those movies explaining the history a bit more so make sure to check them out the tesseract is an infinity stone for more in-depth explanation of what Infinity stones are check out my guardians of the galaxy movie summary the main thing to know about the tesseract is it's a cube of great power and the other wants it so he can give it to his master Thanos nearly all of the recent Marvel movies at least on some level have been influenced by Thanos but we only have seen glimpses of him Thanos is gonna be playing a big role in the future and his desire to get his hands on the Infinity stones is very important loki breaks into the shield headquarters and ends up capturing the tesseract as well as mind controlling a good amount of shield scientists including dr. Erik Selvig the professor from the Thor movies as well as Hawkeye Nick Fury escapes this attack and works to get the Avengers together which does take a bit of convincing the mind controlled Hawkeye ends up stealing iridium that is needed to stabilize the tesseract while at the same time Loki makes a very loud and obvious distraction Loki is captured by the Avengers and taken to shield ship known as the Helicarrier however the tesseract is still hidden away from the Avengers after some investigating the Avengers learned that shield wants the tesseract cube so they can weaponize it which starts a big argument between the agents of shield and the members of the Avengers while arguing the mind controlled Hawkeye and several others of Loki's crew attacked the Helicarrier a big fight breaks out Loki escapes and Hawkeye is knocked unconscious which breaks him from his mind control the Avengers attempt to recover while Loki puts the final parts of his plan into action the still mind controlled dr. Selvig has set up the tesseract on the roof of a building in New York City which he uses to open a massive wormhole from the wormhole a giant army of Chitauri pours in the same army that the other promised to Loki for capturing the tesseract a huge fight breaks out between Loki's army and the Avengers the US government attempts to use a nuclear missile to destroy the whole city of New York in order to prevent the attack from spreading but iron man takes the missile through the wormhole causing it to detonate on the other side in a galaxy far away the explosion causes the wormhole to close and Iron Man falls back to earth Loki is defeated in a rather brutal way by the Hulk and then Thor takes both Loki and the tesseract back to Asgard film opens with the Avengers raiding a Hydra facility in sokovia commanded by Baron Wolfgang von Strucker who has been experimenting on humans using the scepter previously wielded by Loki they encounter test subjects Pierre Joe and Wanda Maximoff who are Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch as well as apprehending Strucker and Loki's scepter as a quick side note these are actually the kids of magneto from the x-men universe but due to licensing issues they cannot refer to this stark and banner The Hulk discovered artificial intelligence within the scepters gem and secretly use it to complete Starks Ultron global defense program it creates a sentient being who believes he must eradicate humanity to save earth it destroys Starks AI Jarvis and attacks the Avengers at their headquarters Ultron escapes with the scepter and uses the resources at the Hydra base to upgrade his body and build an army of robot drones having killed Strucker he recruits the maximum of siblings and sets off to a pain run conda vibranium the Avengers arrive and attack Ultron but the Scarlet Witch subdues them with haunting visions the team goes into hiding in a safe house reeling from the visions Thor departs to consult dr.

the large part of the capital skyward intending to crash it into the ground to cause global extinction banner rescues Black Widow why the Avengers fight Ultron's army fury and others evacuate civilians Quicksilver dies when he shields Hawkeye from gunfire and a vengeful Scarlet Witch abandons her post to destroy Ultron's primary body which allows one of his drones to activate the machine
