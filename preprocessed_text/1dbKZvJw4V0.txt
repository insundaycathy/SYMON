Welcome to Cinema Summary, ladies and gentlemen. Now I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a question for all of  ya: How would you get away with stealing a million dollars? Well, buckle up because you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna figure out how to do so real soon. This is Logan Lucky. So the first thing we see is a man working on his truck with a little girl helping him out. This is Jimmy Logan, an unlucky man living in West Virginia and that is his precious little girl, Sadie who's very excited to be part of the beauty pageant that\xe2\x80\x99s gonna happen real soon although she doesn't know what song she wants to sing. Now Jimmy was a construction worker who\xe2\x80\x99d been working on some tunnels beneath the Charlotte Motors Speedway. But one day he\xe2\x80\x99s fired because his paperwork never mentioned that he had a limp So, frustrated, he drives away, listening to John Denver\xe2\x80\x99s classic \xe2\x80\x9cCountry Road (Take Me Home)\xe2\x80\x9d, his favorite song Which is gonna come up later in the film He stops at Hairwer, a beauty salon where his sister, Mellie works to pick up Sadie from her rehearsal practice. Which is a shame since the practice rehearsal was yesterday and Mellie had to pick Sadie up. And Mellie prattles on and on about what she had to do to pick up Sadie and ends it by telling Jimmy, plain and simple that \xe2\x80\x9cBobbie Jo\xe2\x80\x9d is very angry with him. And then we Jimmy go to this really fancy pants house and he\xe2\x80\x99s here to talk to with his ex-wife, who IS Bobbie Jo. And BOY is she ANGRY with Jimmy: she cannot believe he didn\xe2\x80\x99t pick up Sadie from practice, and just from the way they talk, this isn\xe2\x80\x99t the first time Jimmy Logan screwed up. And as they're talkin' and talkin', Sadie comes running up to greet her daddy, followed by Bobbie Jo\xe2\x80\x99s current husband, Moody Sadie tells Jimmy that she finally knows what she wants to sing for the pageant: Umbrella, y\'know, that "Rihanna" song? And after some bickering, Jimmy leaves, but not before Bobbie tells him that she will be moving soon with Moody and Sadie\xe2\x80\x99s coming with them. Jimmy doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like it, and tells Bobbie that he\xe2\x80\x99s going to get a lawyer to argue against it but with no job, how\xe2\x80\x99s he going to pay for the lawyer? That night he stops by the Duck Tape bar where his brother, Clyde works. Now Clyde\xe2\x80\x99s interesting because he believes in the Logan Family curse: misfortune and bad luck has followed the Logan family forever. Except for Mellie, their sister and after listening to Clyde goin' on and on about the curse, Jimmy goes to the bathroom moments before Max Chilblain comes in: Now he's a British jackhole of a businessman who owns an energy drink brand as well as a NASCAR team. And the first thing he does is make fun of Clyde for his one arm, "The Kindness of a one-armed bartender!" and then orders a Martini. I think what's scary is that there are actually guys like that around The martini's great but it could use some ice. Although that's gonna be a problem since Clyde doesn't have any ice since the local water plant got contaminated and keep this mind 'cause this plot point pays off later. Then Jimmy comes back to the bar and has a back and forth between him and Max, who continues to disrespect Clyde. And during this back-and-forth we find out that Clyde did a few tours in Iraq which is how he lost his arm, and after one final dig at the Logan Brothers Max gets what\xe2\x80\x99s coming to him. As Jimmy starts a bar brawl inside, Clyde, goes outside and with the help of a smoker named Earl makes a Molotov cocktail and uses it to set Max\xe2\x80\x99s car on fire. Setting the car alarm off and bringing Max and his goons running outside to see their car burning, and as Jimmy leaves, bruised and bloodied. He says one word to Clyde: Cauliflower. And that gets Clyde a little steamed up The next day, Clyde wakes up to find Jimmy making bacon and there's a list of rules for robbing a bank on the wall. As they talk during breakfast, we find out a few things: Firstly, Cauliflower is a code word that Jimmy uses when he has an illegal scheme that he wants Clyde to help him with. Secondly Clyde went to juvenile hall when he was 13 because he helped Jimmy with one of his cauliflower schemes. Which explains why he got so angry at the bar. But regardless of all that, Clyde is willing to listen to Jimmy\xe2\x80\x99s new Cauliflower scheme and that involves "Charlotte Motor Speedway" robbing the Charlotte Motor Speedway. Now the Charlotte Motor Speedway is a busy place, that\xe2\x80\x99s basically become its own popular, little town meaning they have their own security force with a lot of rich people there who watch the race, but the thing about the Speedway is that it\xe2\x80\x99s built over landfills that have since become sinkholes, and it\xe2\x80\x99s pipes have burst so now it\xe2\x80\x99s under renovations. Being fixed up by construction crews like the one Jimmy was a part of. And because of his experiences fixing up the pipes he knows that the Speedway uses pneumatic tubes to transfer money and they have these spread throughout the entire stadium going to the vault where all the money is kept. Jimmy plans on robbing the vault on June 4, during the Grocery Tax Lotto Show, when not a lot of security will be there. But to get into the vault they\xe2\x80\x99ll need Joe Bang's help He\xe2\x80\x99s a convict who knows his way around bombs and has experience breaking into bank vaults. So, Jimmy and Clyde visit him in prison and tell Joe that they want his help but he refuses. He\xe2\x80\x99s got money from previous bank heists hidden in a secret stash, why should he help them out? Well, your wife found out about the money stash and she ran off to Florida to marry a truck driver, and she took all the money with her. So now Joe is willing to help but he\xe2\x80\x99s got 5 more months until he\xe2\x80\x99s out. And that won\xe2\x80\x99t be a problem, since Jimmy and Clyde have a plan to not only break Joe out before he\xe2\x80\x99s released, but get him to blow up the vault and put him back into prison before anyone notices he's gone. Joe\xe2\x80\x99s in, but only if he gets his brothers to help them out and only if his brothers get a bigger cut. Something the Logans don\xe2\x80\x99t like one bit. Sometime later, at a local fair, we see Mellie unpacking her car with Sadie\xe2\x80\x99s help as Moody, Bobbie\xe2\x80\x99s husband, comes driving by in a fancy car. And he starts ragging on Mellie for her old car and how bad it is compared to his own and Mellie makes fun of him for not being able to drive stick, making him feel a little self conscious. Now Jimmy is also here to meet with Joe\xe2\x80\x99s brothers: Sam and Fish Bang, to get their help for the heist and after little finagling, they\xe2\x80\x99re in. Later, Clyde runs his car into a convenience store to get sent to the same jail that Joe is in. As Mellie meanwhile takes note of a prison transport van, writing down it\xe2\x80\x99s measurements as it stops at a gas station as its driver goes into the store. Clyde is able to then take this note to Joe in prison where they begin making something out wood and we see a conspicuous can of gray primer sitting nearby. Back home, Mellie paints cockroaches with nail polish, and the plan to break Joe Bang out of prison is starting to take shape as the Fish brothers buy a few essentials like garbage bags, a prybar, and a shovel. Jimmy steals a firefighters outfit and a map from his old workplace and it\xe2\x80\x99s there as he\xe2\x80\x99s leaving that he learns that the construction at the speedway is finishing up real soon. So the breakout plan is going to have to happen a week earlier, A WEEK. EARLIER. So Jimmy tells both Clyde and Mellie that they are going to need to hurry it up And Mellie? Don't forget to call the baker, We then find out that someone has sent a cake to Gleema Purdue a woman who works at the Charlotte Motor Speedway specifically with the Vault. And as Gleema is sharing her cake with her co-workers, she\xe2\x80\x99s called outside to find that her car has been hit and she has to fill out some paperwork. Eugh. But when she finally gets back inside, the vault door is sealed shut. Since the office is closing early, there\xe2\x80\x99s no way back inside which means she\xe2\x80\x99s going to have to wait until tomorrow to finish her cake. Aww man... That night, Fish and Sam sneak onto the construction site at the speedway where they start tampering with the pneumatic tubes, pouring painted cockroaches into different tubes. The next day, Joe asks a fellow prisoner, Naaman for help. And we'll see how this pays off, later. And while that\xe2\x80\x99s happening, Gleema comes back to work, opening the vault where she finds cockroaches crawling all over the vault and on her cake, she then calls a team of exterminators and among them are Sam and Fish who after checking the vault, call Jimmy to tell him that they have a Code Pink. The heist is on. So what is a Code Pink? Well, if you remember from earlier, Mellie paints a bunch of different cockroaches, different colours and these cockroaches are taken by Sam and Fish to the speedway, and then dumped into the pneumatic tube system. Since it's only the pink cockroaches that got into the vault They now which tube actually goes into the vault. And they're gonna use this information In a very specific way. But first in order to get into the vault, they gotta get Joe Bang out of prison It\xe2\x80\x99s the day of the Race! My heart's pounding! Boogidy, Boogidy, Boogidy! Clyde\xe2\x80\x99s working in the infirmary and Joe goes to the workshop to drink some tap water before lunch, as for the Charlotte Speedway is filled with racers, spectators, and camera crews. As Bobbie and Moody are getting ready to take the kids to Sadie\xe2\x80\x99s pageant, Moody shows off his new car (with stick shift) to an unimpressed Mellie who begins packing things in her car\xe2\x80\x99s trunk and we see that she has some firefighter\xe2\x80\x99s outfits inside. Back with Joe, the warden of the prison is making his rounds in cafeteria: he\xe2\x80\x99s one of those guys that cares about how his prison looks good more than he cares about his prisoners So when, Joe begins puking, he\xe2\x80\x99s dragged to the infirmary. After all it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t look good if the prison had a \xe2\x80\x98food problem\xe2\x80\x99 As Mellie puts some finishing touches on Sadie\xe2\x80\x99s outfit and makeup, she begins to make her way out of the building. She\xe2\x80\x99s got an important job to do so she she steals Moody\xe2\x80\x99s car to do it So Joe goes to the bathroom after getting permission from the nurse and with Clyde\xe2\x80\x99s help, they begin their escape. As that\xe2\x80\x99s happening, a prison transport van stops by the workshop just as Joe and Clyde make their way out of the infirmary. They attach their wooden box things painted gray to the bottom of the car just in time as the van drives away and the race is 2 minutes from starting. And that's when prisoners know that its time... For a riot! In response, the warden causes the prison to enter a lockdown and stops a prison guard from reporting the riot to keep the prison's perfect record. Just as Fish and Sam blow up a generator, at least partially knocking out power for the speedway, because now the electronic card readers at the speedway don\xe2\x80\x99t work "We got no plastic workin\' at all." Now everyone has to pay in cash. Just in time as Joe and Clyde roll out from under the prison van and run into a familiar car and drive away with Mellie\xe2\x80\x99s help. So it\xe2\x80\x99s all coming together: The crowbar, that was bought earlier in the film was smuggled into the prison and used by Joe and Clyde to get out of the infirmary. And the reason why Mellie was watching that prison van weeks before was to figure out its size, it\xe2\x80\x99s dimensions, it's size and its schedule. That way Joe and Clyde can make those wooden box things, paint them gray, and fit them underneath the van to create fake bottoms that they then use to escape from the prison. And then meet up with Mellie who then takes them to the Speedway. Now the reason why Joe was talking with Namaan: was to get Namaan\xe2\x80\x99s help in starting the riot. That way they would enter lockdown mode for the prison and give Joe and Clyde enough time to escape and make it to the speedway. And if you\xe2\x80\x99re wondering why Joe was drinking tap water, well remember how I said that the local water plant got contaminated? Joe is drinking contaminated tap water, and he drinks so much of it that he gets sick and ended up puking and then he got sent to the infirmary. Where he Clyde make their escape. You see how everything is coming together? Now that he\xe2\x80\x99s escaped, now begins the actual heist. Are you ready for it? Let\xe2\x80\x99s go! Jimmy breaks into the service entrance of the Speedway, as the race is underway and we find out that there\xe2\x80\x99s a racer named Dayton White and he\xe2\x80\x99s sponsored by Max Chilblain. Now Dayton is very meticulous with his diet, keeping himself healthy to an insanely exact degree. But since he\xe2\x80\x99s sponsored by Max, he has to drink Max\xe2\x80\x99s stupid energy drink on camera and let\xe2\x80\x99s just say he ain\xe2\x80\x99t happy about it one bit Now since the race is really starting to get goin, the shopkeepers at the Charlotte Speedway are forced to start putting away their earnings into the tube system early, not even bothering to count the amount of money being sent to the vault And keep this in mind, because this becomes very important later in the film Finally, Joe, Clyde and Mellie arrive at the speedway Where Joe buys some things for the heist. "Gimme two packs of those gummy bears." And now the heist begins. First step: Get beneath track. Second step: make the bomb. Sorry. Improvised Explosive Device. Step 3: Send the bomb through the tubes. Step 4: Boom Smoke starts coming out of the tubes which gets the attention of local security who send a few guys down to investigate For the Logans and Bang Brothers, The heist is going good so far, as they hooked up a vacuum that sucks the money from the vault straight into the garbage bags into their garbage bags. And then they get a little greedy and try to increase the sucking speed which leads to Clyde\xe2\x80\x99s arm getting sucked into the vacuum and Clyde stops the vacuum machine and gets into fight over whether or not Clyde should get his arm. But after some convincing, he turns the machine on. They got a job to do. Meanwhile on the race track, Dayton starts blacking out at the wheel and crashes his car As for Fish and Sam, they put the moneybags onto a warehouse shuttle cart and drive off only to bump into two security guards who ask them if they smelled any smoke. And although they act awfully suspicious the guards let them go, but not without investigating further. There's something strange about those two. And as they investigate, they find a room with smoke leaking out of it and and there inside they find: Earl, a friend of Clyde and Jimmy smoking a ciggy, that you might recognize from these 2 scenes. who distracts the guards long enough for Joe to help out his brothers who can\xe2\x80\x99t seem to get one of the dang gates open. Realizing Joe\xe2\x80\x99s been gone for too long, he goes to check on Joe and runs into the guards who ask him if smelled any smoke. \xe2\x80\x9cNope\xe2\x80\x9d. \xe2\x80\x9cOK, move along.\xe2\x80\x9d and goes to help the Bang brothers out with the gate. Successfully opening it. The brothers get away as Jimmy and Joe go back, with Joe and Clyde making their escape. Meanwhile Dayton storms off in a huff: he screwed up the race because he drank some of Max\xe2\x80\x99s stupid energy drink and he blames Max for costing him the race. As Max follows Dayton he runs into Joe and Clyde. And he recognizes Clyde. Uh oh. And to make matters worse! Jimmy and Mellie are going to be late for Sadie\xe2\x80\x99s performance! So Joe and Clyde get out of dodge heading back to the prison and Jimmy leaves as well, checking his pickup truck to find the bags of cash stored away in the back. By now, the race is almost finished, and the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s continue with the next step of the plan: Cause a fire. Sort of. You see earlier in the film, something I didn\xe2\x80\x99t show you was that the prisoners covered up the windows and the cameras using a variety of things so the Warden and the guards can\xe2\x80\x99t look into the cafeteria, so they have no other choice but to call the local firefighters just in time for Clyde and Joe, to sneak on a firetruck and get back into the prison, disguised as firefighters With the guards never noticing. Mellie finds her way back to the pageant just in time to put the final finishing touches to Sadie\xe2\x80\x99s outfit but there\xe2\x80\x99s one little hiccup: her daddy said he\xe2\x80\x99d be here! But with no dad in sight she goes on stage and stares into the crowd, ready to sing Umbrella but then she sees her daddy\xe2\x80\x99s there. And she decides to sing a song that\xe2\x80\x99s special to her daddy. Her daddy\xe2\x80\x99s favorite song, Country Roads (Take Me Home). And Sadie finishes her performance to great fanfare and Jimmy now finished with the heist leaves his truck with the money at a gas station. The next morning, news reports come rolling in: "Authorities, have confirmed, they have recovered money stolen from the Charlotte Motor Speedway" It was found in a pickup truck at a gas station last night after an someone called it in. We then see a woman walking through the crime scenes. This is Agent Grayson and she\xe2\x80\x99s investigating the Speedway Heist: checking the vault and the tunnel where the vacuum machine was. And there\xe2\x80\x99s not much there but she has a witness: Max Chilblain, who claims that he saw Clyde and Joe at the Speedway and recognizes Clyde as the one-armed bartender. "You don\'t believe me do you? Dayton saw them too! Dayton can back me up!" And then we find out from Agent Grayson, that Dayton told her that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t see any one armed bartender named Clyde. He LIED. Speaking of Clyde, he\xe2\x80\x99s armless and out of prison and when he gets home, glum as can be He finds a special surprise waiting for him in a box from the Department of Veteran Affairs The next day, Agent Grayson, comes to the prison demanding information from the warden who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t say anything that helps with the investigation. In fact, he intentionally avoids any conversation about the riot. About Joe Bang, and about Clyde Logan. So Agent Grayson has no leads: her suspects have airtight alibis so she can't investigate them. Because officially Clyde and Joe were \xe2\x80\x98still at the prison\xe2\x80\x99 at the time of the riot as for Jimmy he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a phone or a car with GPS so they can\xe2\x80\x99t track his location. She\xe2\x80\x99s got nothing. Fast-forward months later, and Joe is free and the first thing he does is visit Clyde\xe2\x80\x99s bar to talk with Clyde who has new robotic arm. And we find out that since the heist, Jimmy has been silent: neither Joe nor Clyde have heard anything from Jimmy. He might be in Pittsburgh since Sadie and Bobbie Jo moved there with Moody there a while ago. But even that\xe2\x80\x99s debatable and so Joe leaves frustrated: Neither of them know what happened with Jimmy or why the money was returned. Or who returned the money. As for Agent Grayson? Well the company that owns the Speedway is shutting Speedway Heist case: since a large amount of money was returned and now they got a sizable insurance check, recouping their losses from the heist. But here\xe2\x80\x99s the thing: Agent Grayson and her team have investigated and they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find an exact amount of money that was made on the day of heist. Because if you remember, none of the card readers worked and the money was never counted on the day of the heist. So it\xe2\x80\x99s very strange that the Speedway company was able to make an insurance claim without ever knowing the exact amount of money that was lost. So for all they know: Only some of the money money was ever returned. Now we then see Joe back home when he hears a knock at his door. He checks outside where he at first sees no one, he even checks around the corner brandishing a shovel in case anyone\xe2\x80\x99s nearby. There\xe2\x80\x99s no one there but wait a second: Why would this brand new shovel be here? And then he stomps his way to a nearby tree and digs into his backyard to find a trash bag full of money marked with a red tie. Someone returned money to his secret stash. We then see how the whole heist played out: Jimmy hid a lot of details from the Bang Brothers. For one: he messed with the gate, stalling the Bang brothers long enough for him to hide specific bags of cash, during the heist these bags were then put into a dumpster, and then taken to a truck, driven by Earl. And then taken to a landfill. Where they were dug up later As to how Jimmy was able to figure out where they were and which ones were the right ones? Well, Earl marked them down on a map, and the garbage bags were marked with red ties. And also during the heist, Jimmy grabbed Clyde's arm and made sure to hide any evidence that they were down there. As for Jimmy? Well, he\xe2\x80\x99s living in Pittsburgh, back on good terms with Bobbie Jo and able to visit Sadie whenever he wants. And after some time he goes back to visit Clyde where we reunite with our heisters: Clyde\xe2\x80\x99s still bartending, and Joe and Mellie seem to have a thing going on. And while he's there Clyde asks Jimmy how he knew when to search for the money and the answer is pretty simple: because the police were investigating Jimmy, they tapped his phone however Jimmy didn't pay his phone bill but somehow the phone service wasn't cut off. So he knew they were tracking him So all he had to do was wait until he lost reception and service, and he knew by then the police had stopped tracking him. And that\xe2\x80\x99s how Jimmy got away with stealing millions of dollars. I guess the Logan family curse was just a myth after all. As Clyde continues to bartend, he\xe2\x80\x99s called over by a lonely woman who wants someone to drink with her. After all, it's bad luck to drink alone. But here\xe2\x80\x99s the kicker that\xe2\x80\x99s Agent Grayson, whose thinking of staying in Virginia a little while longer: waiting for her chance to arrest the Speedway Heisters. Looks like the Logan Family curse strikes again So you\xe2\x80\x99re probably wondering about a few things like why did Jimmy return the money? And very simply it was to get the investigators off his trail. Because if you remember from  earlier, they blow up a generator. That causes the card readers at the speedway to fail meaning that the shopkeepers now have to take cash only. And they put this cash into the pneumatic tube system, with out counting it. And this is crucial, because of this no one actually knows the exact amount of money made on the day of the heist and no one knows the actual amount of money that was stolen. By returning a 'lot of money', it looks all of it if not a majority of it was returned, even though we know better. And it\xe2\x80\x99s heavily implied that the amount of the money the company made from the insurance claim, was significantly larger than the actual amount of money stolen from them in the first place. Which is great for the company, except they made it through less than legal means and they don\xe2\x80\x99t want the FBI finding this out. So they shutdown the investigation, and they close the case and consequently leave Jimmy alone. Now as to why Jimmy never told the Bang Brothers about his plan? it's very simple: He didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to split the money. You see originally there were only supposed to be 3 heisters: Jimmy, Joe, and Clyde. But to get Joe\xe2\x80\x99s help, they had to hire Sam and Fish and as a stipulation, they had to give the Bang Brothers a majority of the money. Which was a bad deal for the Logans So in order to keep a majority of the money, they had to make it look like all of it was given back and that none of it was kept by the Logans that way the Bang Brother would leave them alone. Since they had no reason to hassle them. Now the reason why Dayton lied to Agent Grayson about not seeing Joe and Clyde at the Speedway was that he wanted revenge.You see for Dayton: Winning is everything! and he blames Max for his losing the race Because Dayton believes, that if he had never drank any of Max's stupid energy drink before the race: He would've won. So as a form of revenge: he intentionally lies to Agent Grayson, telling her that he didn't see Joe or Clyde at the Speedway making Max look like a liar in a federal investigation Which finally brings me to  the Logan Family curse: Which I believe is real and it\xe2\x80\x99s that last shot with Agent Grayson that convinced me. You see the Logans have a lot of lucky breaks during the course of the investigation: Max (Agent Grayson\xe2\x80\x99s only witness) is made a liar by Dayton\xe2\x80\x99s testimony, and any questions that Agent Grayson has about Joe and Clyde are left unanswered by the prison warden, and finally the company that got robbed actually shuts down the investigation. All of these things allow the Logans to escape but ironically they are also what bring Agent Grayson to West Virginia. It\xe2\x80\x99s almost like all the luck, they had earlier got turned around And it looks like the Logan family curse will strike again.
