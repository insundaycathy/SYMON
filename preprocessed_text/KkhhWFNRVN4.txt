\xef\xbb\xbfIntro In part 1 of How to Beat the Humans as \xe2\x80\x9cThe Thing\xe2\x80\x9d, we broke down what the Thing is, broke out of the alien-thing\xe2\x80\x99s ice tomb, assimilated Griggs and Lar\xe2\x80\x99s dog, and started conspiring against the entire human race.  In this part we will continue our rampage, and see if we can beat the humans or not.  Let\xe2\x80\x99s get to it, the thing\xe2\x80\x99s intestines are itching to strangle drunk Norwegion researchers.  They are so dead. Body  With the Dog-Thing running off to the other research stations, and The alien-thing distracting all the humans who are out searching for it, Griggs-Thing could return to the humans acting all freaked out to blend back in. Or. It could use this opportunity to sabotage weapons and communications. Griggs-Thing would have memories of the radio equipment, who operates the radio, and the stockpiles of flamethrowers in the shed. The guns and axes aren\xe2\x80\x99t particularly dangerous to the Thing, but the napalm hoses are. Griggs-thing need only use it\xe2\x80\x99s memories to envision what a flamethrower would do to a human body.  Yah, let's try to avoid that. Puncturing holes in the tanks and cutting fuel lines should only take a minute. You could also light the shed on fire, but that would bring too much attention and suspicion to why the flamethrowers were destroyed. Right now, none of the humans are thinking about busting out the torch guns, so subtly sabotaging them is the best bet. After destroying the most dangerous weapons the humans have, cutting the communications out of the base is the next priority. The humans don\xe2\x80\x99t know about the thing, yet, but if they did decide to phone home about the alien, or they did find out about the thing cells and relayed that information, a bunch of men in black are going to show up and start causing problems for the thing.  The thing might be able to use the increased foot traffic in and out of Antarctica to it\xe2\x80\x99s benefit, but the chances of a strict quarantine, and intensive research and experimentation done on the soon to be alien corpse or the sample Dr Sander took will expose the thing, leading to its eradication. The less alert people are, the better.  While everyone\xe2\x80\x99s still out searching for the alien, Griggs-Thing should have time to also go spill some coffee on the radio equipment, fray some wires, or something to destroy it.  The helicopters, snowcats, and other forms of transportation can be left unimpaired for now. Eventually the thing will need to leave this research station, and hoofing it on foot in -40 degree temps isn\xe2\x80\x99t ideal, even for the thing. Even if the humans figured out what the thing is, they are unlikely to allow anyone to physically leave the station because they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t know who was actually a thing. They can\xe2\x80\x99t risk it escaping.  Some of the researchers stumble upon the dog kennel. There\xe2\x80\x99s blood everywhere. Why would the thing leave a bloody mess after assimilating the dog, but not Griggs. This may have been intentional by the thing. As far as the researchers are concerned, the dog was killed and eaten by the bug alien. This is actually ideal, because if or when the humans figure out the nature of the thing, they will realize that the dog would be a threat and try to find and kill it. This way, they think it\xe2\x80\x99s dead and gone.  The alien-thing has still managed to evade the humans so far, but it\xe2\x80\x99s options are dwindling. It could try to make it back to the spaceship, but the problem is that it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know where it is. Griggs-thing would know, but with the humans out looking for them, they probably didn\xe2\x80\x99t have time to stay and chat.  Even if it did know where the spaceship was, and could transform some alien neural-bio links to operate the spaceship, it is obviously not flyable or else it would have left Earth a long time ago. The best option I could think of is to badly wound and infect some of the humans before running off into the night and digging itself into a hidden ice coffin where the humans wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t find it. Wounding instead of killing the humans will cause them to abandon the chase to provide medical care for their friends. This distraction and diversion of resources gives the alien-thing the breathing room to run and hide.  It\xe2\x80\x99s possible the alien-thing won\xe2\x80\x99t survive another freeze, but the humans are going to kill it anyways. The last thing griggs-thing and dog-thing need is for humans to start studying it\xe2\x80\x99s alien body and putting it\xe2\x80\x99s cells under the microscope.  Badly injuring the humans will also cause them to evacuate their wounded to a good hospital in a more populated region, enabling the things to spread further.  Instead of doing all this strategic shit, the alien-thing decides to nom on Henrik.  To be fair, it can be hard to think straight when your starving corpse is thawed and re-animated after a 100 thousand years, only to be immediately attacked by another species. The rest of the humans converge on it and are forced to gun it down and burn it, seeing as how it killed or was killing their friend. Poor Henrik. He woke up that morning, and could never have imagined that this was the way his life would end.  Being pulled inside an alien bug\xe2\x80\x99s stomach. It\xe2\x80\x99s digestive acids searing and breaking down his flesh. Only able to make muffled screams while suffocating and losing blood. Your friends realize they can\xe2\x80\x99t help you so they start shooting at it to try to kill you and it.  None of them put you out of your misery. The fiery stinging of bullets hitting you is just more pain added to the agony of melting and suffocating. Then they light it, and you, on fire.  Only then did his consciousness give out. Maybe he died immediately though.  Despite the alien thing failing to hide it\xe2\x80\x99s body in the snow, with no comms or weapons, griggs-thing blending in nicely, and dog thing on it\xe2\x80\x99s way to another station, I think we\xe2\x80\x99re still on track for world domination in 27,000 hours.  Olav, who just witnessed Henrik get mauled and digested by the alien-thing, is now in the infirmary getting checked out by Karl, with none other than Griggs-thing right next to them. All Griggs-thing needs to do is touch them. Not like some stupid finger poke, but like a pat on the back of the head, brush against their arm, caress his cheek slowly, ya know, something subtle.  Light touching should be a viable strategy from everything we know. Every cell in a thing\xe2\x80\x99s body is a thing cell, each thing cell actively seeks out non thing cells to assimilate and spread to. One skin thing cell rubbing up against a non thing cell should cause it to spread. It is possible that the thing cells do take some time to recognize non thing cells, divide via mitosis, and attack foreign cells, and this may take some seconds. Mitosis in humans does take around 2 hours to complete. So just simply brushing against them might not work, even if the thing can perform mitosis and have one of the daughter cells invade the foreign cells in 10-20 seconds, that would mean Griggs-Thing would have to hold hands with Olav for an.. uncomfortable amount of time to infect him. This is still a viable strategy for Griggs-thing though, as all he\xe2\x80\x99d need to do is the old spit handshake. The thing cells in the saliva would transfer to the human hand and have enough time to start assimilating. There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of variations to this you could use, if you just use your sick imaginations.  You might not even need to touch them. As we are all very aware by now, the air that exits your mouth contains respiratory droplets, which contain all kinds of cells from your body, including pathogens. These droplets containing thing cells can hang in the air and travel many feet. Just being in the same room and talking to them could infect them with thing cells. If he wanted to expedite the infection process, Griggs-thing could also just sneeze in their faces too.  Say Griggs-thing did rudely sneeze in their faces. How would it know they were infected and turned into things too? For that matter, how do thing\xe2\x80\x99s know who other things are in general?  Things can\xe2\x80\x99t just ask other organisms if they are things or not, nor is it possible to visually detect other things given they are imitating their enemy. They could physically touch each other to confirm, like slime molds conjoining to communicate with each other, but that\xe2\x80\x99s also pretty impractical and overt.  My guess is it would be a form of chemical sensing. Similar to how individual cells communicate with neurotransmitters and hormones, so too could things. Part of the assimilation process\xe2\x80\x99s biological alterations could be to enhance olfactory receptor neurons in the host, so that it can detect a distinct odor other things give off.  This odor would be undetectable to other organisms or humans. Similar to how a dog might be able to sense whether a woman is pregnant or not based on hormone production causing them to give off a unique odor, even though we can\xe2\x80\x99t. This means that two things who were assimilated independently of each other could be in the same room with other humans, realize each other are things, then go verbally conspire against the humans elsewhere.  Griggs-thing could just grab both of them and shove tentacles in their necks, but it\xe2\x80\x99s too risky that they would make a commotion and get caught. While it\xe2\x80\x99s cinematic and intense to use grotesque forms to assimilate others, that\xe2\x80\x99s only necessary once you\xe2\x80\x99ve been made and the victim is trying to escape, kill you, and warn others. The things just need to use the invasion of the body snatchers strategy of blending in as much as possible, and only announcing your presence and revealing your attack form when you are caught or have an overwhelming advantage.  While everyone\xe2\x80\x99s autopsying the alien with their sandwich gloves, breathing in all it\xe2\x80\x99s steaming innards, Griggs-thing was in the break room pouring another cup of joe.  This may be a good opportunity to spike the coffee pot everyone drinks out of with a couple drops of \xe2\x80\x98Thing\xe2\x80\x99 blood. Like David did to Dr. Holloway in Alien Prometheus.  You\xe2\x80\x99d have to let the coffee cool down a bit first, but if the Thing had blueprints for thermophiles like it did for cryophiles, the thing cells could easily handle 120 degree temperatures the coffee would be served at. The cells in the cups would be ingested by many of the researchers, and within minutes they\xe2\x80\x99d be thing versions of themselves. This is an easy way to infect many people at once.  Juliette starts feeling woozy from the autopsy and starts coughing. This is likely a natural reaction from seeing Henrik\xe2\x80\x99s corpse and not from being assimilated. Like we talked about in part 1, you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t know you were being assimilated. Griggs-thing comes out of the break room, sees Juliette alone in the hallway coughing, and goes to console her. Griggs is such a sympathetic soul, consoling everyone who isn\xe2\x80\x99t feeling good. Griggs-thing patting her on the back and breathing in her direction might have been enough to infect her, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not guaranteed, which is why he most likely followed her into the bathroom to finish the job.  Right now Griggs-thing is pretty much taking people out impulsively based on whoever seems isolated enough. It\xe2\x80\x99s not a terrible strategy, but it could be better coordinated, especially with its access to Griggs\xe2\x80\x99 memories. Griggs-thing should be targeting the people who are most likely to and capable of figuring out what the thing is. Whoever is in charge of studying the alien is the priority target, because they will be the ones to sound the alarms. Griggs-thing would know that Sander is an arrogant fool.  Adam is a docile follower and unlikely to speak up without Sander\xe2\x80\x99 permission.  Which leaves Kate Lloyd as the primary skeptic researcher and target.  She\xe2\x80\x99s the vertebrate paleontologist, and a human who would understand what she was looking at under the microscope. The others are just geologists, climatologists, ecologists, or other unrelated fields. Kate Lloyd was brought in specifically for this task. I mean, she\xe2\x80\x99s not exactly qualified to research alien life forms, but she\xe2\x80\x99s the most relevant person for the job apparently? Really, now that I think about it, why the hell did they hire her. It certainly wasn\xe2\x80\x99t because she would keep her mouth shut and fall in line. There has to be way more qualified and discrete people they could have chosen instead.  I also think it\xe2\x80\x99s worth mentioning that the things should be communicating what they know to each other as best as possible. Griggs-thing should tell Juliette-thing that the dog-thing is on it\xe2\x80\x99s way to another station, that comms and weapons were sabotaged, that it was going to try to assimilate Sam Carter before they make it to McMurdo and that Juliette should try to infect Kate next. You don\xe2\x80\x99t want to just infect other people and have them all doing their own things which might jeopardize the operation.  Gotta stay coordinated and organized. Juliette-thing would have communicated to Griggs-thing that when she was in the rec room, Carter said he was taking Olav to the military hospital in McMurdo because he developed some form of psychological shock from the incident, and that Carter said he was going to blow the lid off this whole operation and tell everyone about the alien and spaceship. This would bring a lot of unnecessary heat and scrutiny, which makes Carter the primary target now. Griggs-thing was already consoling Olav, and is clearly closer friends with him. It makes sense for Griggs-thing to hitch a ride, stop Carter, and further infect McMurdo station. McMurdo is where the C17 transport out of Antarctica is too, so this would be a way off the continent and into the more populated areas of the Earth.  Meanwhile, Juliette-thing should immediately go to intercept the secondary target, Kate Lloyd.  Juliette-thing apparently had better things to do, and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t intercept Kate before she examines a blood sample of the alien-thing and discovers it\xe2\x80\x99s imitation and assimilation abilities.  Kate also finds Juliette\xe2\x80\x99s fillings in the shower. Damnit Juliette-thing. How hard is it to clean up after yourself? You easily could have turned the shower on and picked up your fillings. The fuck is the point of imitating your prey if you leave a mess of your blood, tooth fillings, and metal implants for others to find. Not only did you fail to intercept Kate, you left even more evidence for her to become even more suspicious that something foul is at play.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t really get the whole, The Thing can\xe2\x80\x99t replicate inorganic material plot device. Thing cells would simply ignore the inorganic material and only assimilate the organic tissue. If the thing cells perfectly replicated a host organism\xe2\x80\x99s cells, which had already adapted to the implant or simply didn't care about things like dental fillings, then the Thing version shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be rejecting them either. In the 1982 movie, Norris-Thing accidentally replicated a heart defect, which caused the Thing to have a genuine heart attack, ultimately exposing it. If the Thing replicates the host\xe2\x80\x99s perfectly, and the assimilated human needs a metal brace to function:  Then spitting that metal brace out would damage the host organism and expose it.  But even if the Thing organisms do reject inorganic materials for some unknown reason, it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be that much of a problem if the things simply cleaned up after themselves. Or re-pierced their earrings if they had them. Piercings are literally just a healed hole, it\xe2\x80\x99s not like the human body or thing would reject it again. While Griggs-thing successfully makes it onto the chopper, Juliette-thing decides to assimilate Edvard in secret.  Griggs-thing could walk up to the pilot and co-pilot and start coughing, but he decides to stay seated for the flight to not risk making anyone suspicious. He \xe2\x80\x98will\xe2\x80\x99 need to take Carter out before they land though. Kate, having discovered the nature of the thing, runs outside and flags the chopper down, and Carter agrees to land it.  What should griggs-thing do? He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t actually know why the chopper is landing.  Why would a vertebrate paleontologist and not the camp leader be flagging the chopper down. It\xe2\x80\x99s possible that Juliette-thing didn\xe2\x80\x99t intercept Kate in time, and she managed to figure out what the thing is. It\xe2\x80\x99s also very possible that it\xe2\x80\x99s just nothing.  But considering Carter and Kate are by far the biggest tattle-tale bitches on this base and Carter was already itching to get the word out, combined with whatever Kate is up to, it can\xe2\x80\x99t be good. Crashing the helicopter and stopping Carter would make all the researchers panic, but without a functioning radio they will have to physically go to other bases for help. Juliette-thing could then infect whomever is going to the other base for help, and she can stay and further infect the Thule station.  The problem with crashing the helicopter is that it's hovering right above the base. There\xe2\x80\x99s no guarantee that Carter would\xe2\x80\x99ve steered it into a valley miles and miles away. If it had crashed in the station\xe2\x80\x99s premises, and everyone discovered that griggs turned into a spaghetti monster, the jig would be up. Landing the chopper safely and maintaining deception might be the better decision. Edvard, Juliette, and Griggs-thing\xe2\x80\x99s could all focus fire on Kate and Carter once back at base. Even if Kate immediately started ranting about the thing cells replication abilities, nobody will believe her initially.  So there will be a window of opportunity to infect them and others at the base. Keeping suspicions low is probably the best move for now. Griggs-thing instead opts for option 1 and explodes into tentacles and starts attacking Olav and the pilots.  Luckily Carter flies the helicopter into a hillside miles away. The researchers attempt to radio for help, but Colin, the radio operator, says it\xe2\x80\x99s not working, that it might be the storm rolling in causing interference. Ah, so Griggs-thing did manage to sabotage it. Yah I know in the movie it actually is a bad storm, but I like to think it was griggs-thing executing the plan correctly.  The researchers call an all-hands meeting to discuss what to do, which Kate rudely interrupts with her rants about alien cells replicating people. Nobody seems to believe her, nor is willing to spend 5 minutes checking the blood sample in the lab.  Edvard and Juliette-things are just sitting in on the convo, which must be a bit awkward for them hearing Kate talk about them as a single cell that replicates the body they are existing in, which was formerly their friend. Edvard-thing orders the team to drive a snowcat to Halley station to retrieve Thule stations\xe2\x80\x99s helicopter which is refueling there, and asks Colin and Lars to join him on their journey. The radio operator was a good pick, as he won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to stay and fix the radio. If Edvard-thing can make it to the helicopter at Halley station and infect Lars and Colin on the way, it will open up a lot of possibilities for spreading to the rest of Earth. There\xe2\x80\x99s no need to bring Juliette-thing, she should stay and infect the others at the base. Starting with Kate. It\xe2\x80\x99s only a matter of time before she comes up with hard evidence and a way to kill the things. She has to go. The rest will fall easily after that. Juliette needs to isolate Kate first, which you would think would be difficult considering Kate should be extremely cautious about social distancing when 1 thing cell could kill her. But Kate doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to care.  Juliette-thing uses her memories of where the snowcat keys are to suggest to Kate that they should hide the keys. It\xe2\x80\x99s a perfect proposal, because the key room is isolated and she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t suspect that the thing would propose cutting off travel out of the base.  What Kate doesn\xe2\x80\x99t understand is that the thing doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need to leave the base right now, it can just assimilate everyone here then leave at it\xe2\x80\x99s leisure.  Juliette-thing finally isolates Kate, the primary target, and instead of just shanking her with a knife covered in your own blood, it opts to needlessly transform into a giant mouth with a tentacle.  Very sophisticated attack form ya got there, I'm sure a lot of thought went into its design. The transformation process is also painfully slow, and gives Kate every opportunity to run.  Juliette-thing just blew everything for the things. Juliette was a bad human to assimilate, as imitating her meant imitating a brain structure that was unintelligent. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t clean up after herself in the bathroom, didn\xe2\x80\x99t intercept Kate in time, and then when she finally had the opportunity to kill Kate she botched the whole thing and gave the humans all the evidence they needed to become aware of the threat and fight back.  She manages to only kill the lowest threat human in the entire group, Karl, before getting torched by the flamethrowers.  Well, I guess Griggs-thing didn\xe2\x80\x99t sabotage the weapons after all. In a last ditch effort, Juliette-thing remembers the kitchen has extinguishers and uses them to put the fire out. But it\xe2\x80\x99s no match for their flamethrowers that have an unlimited fuel supply.  Karl might be able to turn into a thing too, but Juliette-thing massively damaged him, and the humans will burn him before he can heal. There\xe2\x80\x99s actually a deleted scene where he did heal and ran off.  Edvard-thing has to be pissed that Juliette-thing didn\xe2\x80\x99t wait a few minutes so he could have escaped with Colin and Lars. Now he\xe2\x80\x99s stuck here with everyone agreeing to a quarantine.  There should still be a flamethrower in the shed though. He could grab it and just roast everyone. The thing has the element of surprise, and the other humans would hesitate to kill who they think is their friend. The time for covert assimilation is up, the thing just needs to use the human\xe2\x80\x99s weapons against them right now. After burning them all to a crisp, he\xe2\x80\x99d be free to leave and infect the world.  Kate proposes a blood test to verify who is human. Sander and Adam agree to go set up the test while everyone else goes to sabotage all transportation out of the station. Edvard-thing got really lucky that everyone was stupid enough to split up like this.  He needs to find something to light the lab on fire with. While perusing the base for flammables, he runs into Kate and Lars acting shady in a shed.  On Kate, Lars, and Edvard-thing\xe2\x80\x99s way back to camp, they see Jameson and Carter arrive out of the blizzard. Juliette-thing, while dumb and reckless, should have debriefed Edvard-thing that Griggs-thing was on the chopper when it crashed. Griggs-thing obviously didn\xe2\x80\x99t make it, but Jameson and Carter might have been infected. There\xe2\x80\x99s no way to tell, as sniffing out their sweet sweet thing pheromones isn\xe2\x80\x99t possible in this blizzard.  This could be another ploy to divert suspicion away from himself, but this could also be to eliminate what it thinks are likely just other human threats.  Jameson and Carter showing up right now is perfect timing, even better that Kate and Lars split up to go imprison them until the test is ready. Edvard-thing can use this distraction to sabotage the lab by getting some gas and flares, waiting for Adam and Dr. Sander to leave, then lighting it on fire.
