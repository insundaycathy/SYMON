Welcome to Moviecaps. Today I will show you a Sci-fi, Drama, Thriller film from 2017, titled The Circle. Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care. Mae Holland is on a kayak in the middle of a lake. Her phone rings but she ignores it and continues what seems to be her favorite hobby. We are then introduced to her typical day of work at a water company, answering calls of angry customers. Her exhausting day is far from being over as her car breaks on her way back home. She calls her friend Mercer, who is a handy guy, helping her fix her car. Despite his successful job at fixing the car, his attempt of inviting Mae for a dinner that night turns out to be a failure. Once home, Mae is having dinner with her parents who are pretty fond of Mercer and definitely not shy to suggest that they should be a couple. Much to their dismay, Mae is not welcoming the idea. Another aspect of Mae\xe2\x80\x99s family is shown during this dinner: Mae\xe2\x80\x99s dad has Multiple Sclerosis and it is not covered by insurance. \xe2\x80\x9cAnother day, another opportunity\xe2\x80\x9d, a saying that was pretty literal for Mae, as in the midst of yet another hectic day, she got a call from her friend Annie, saying that the company she\xe2\x80\x99s working for is hiring up to a hundred people and that Mae should take the interview the next day. Ex-Hermione was delighted to hear the news and so she excitedly headed to The Circle the following day for the interview. Your typical interview? Not really. But Mae was able to make it through and is now part of The Circle customer experience team. Annie then introduces Mae to the many facilities the company has, from headquarters of different departments to leisure and sports. Mae is pretty surprised, but just then, before she could elaborately express her thoughts, her extremely busy friend leaves her in the hands of the customer experience unit head. Mae is shown a demonstration of how to deal with customers and the metrics used to rate her performance. Mae was hoping to get her score above 90 but Annie reassured that her 87 score was satisfactory for the first week. The reassurance sunk in as the friends got seated at The Circle conference \xe2\x80\x9cDream Friday\xe2\x80\x9d. It is hosted by Bailey, a laid-back CEO making jokes here and there, while introducing the company\xe2\x80\x99s latest innovation SeeChange. SeeChange is cameras as small as a coin and that can be implemented anywhere without being noticed. The moral motive behind this, according to Bailey, is tracking wrongdoers and holding them accountable in order to make a change in the community. This announcement is followed by a party featuring the artist Beck. Annie then takes Mae to a somehow secret place where she makes her say a verbal non-disclosure statement, as what goes on there is extremely confidential being the place where the magic happens. Annie has to rush to catch a flight to Australia, too much for business trips if you ask me. Mae is then left alone. She makes her way back to the party and tries to start a conversation with who she assumed to be a fellow employee. The man was busy on his phone, still he welcomed the conversation with Mae. Since she seemed excited about her new position he guessed that she was a newbie or one of the \xe2\x80\x9cguppies\xe2\x80\x9d, as Bailey liked to call them. He strangely told her, with a hint of sarcasm, to keep on that excitement as he left for an urgent matter. Mae spent the weekend at a certain gathering with her parents who are proud of her for making it to the \xe2\x80\x9cGreatest company of the country\xe2\x80\x9d. They\xe2\x80\x99re still trying to pimp her up with Mercer but Mae isn\xe2\x80\x99t so fond of the idea and she goes as far as saying some hurtful words to him, degrading to some extent. Once back at the table with her parents, her dad has an episode and her mom escorts him back inside. Feeling overwhelmed, Mae goes kayaking as she lets her sorrows roll down her cheeks in the form of tears. A new week for Mae at The Circle and as she is watching the news coverage about the senator questioning The Circle\xe2\x80\x99s true intentions, she is interrupted by two of her co-workers. They try to make her feel guilty about not attending some gatherings and activities during the weekends and seek personal information that they note down on their tablets. They were building a profile of Mae and wanted to know everything about her. They seemed to know about her father\xe2\x80\x99s MS that she hasn\xe2\x80\x99t mentioned before and went on as far as telling her to catch up with the eight thousand group messages. The exchange was an explicit privacy violation sugar-coated by the purpose of enhancing the sense of community. Mae is left in disbelief but she still does her best to boost her efforts and she finally achieves a perfect score. She has a brief call with her mom that updates her on her father\xe2\x80\x99s health. Mae feels sorry that she\xe2\x80\x99s not there for them as she stays at the dorm to keep up with her work. During the video call, she notices her friend\xe2\x80\x99s Mercer\xe2\x80\x99s latest work, a pretty chandelier that she shares on The Circle community group. Busy Annie is back and she introduces Mae to Dr. Jessica who performs her medical intake that is none-other than daily data stored on the company\xe2\x80\x99s Cloud and available via the employees\xe2\x80\x99 tablets. The Doctor offers to get Mae\xe2\x80\x99s parents on their health plan which takes Mae over the moon as it is an opportunity to save her father. Next up is a conference by Tom, Bailey\xe2\x80\x99s associate, and hosting a senator candidate who advocates accountability through data sharing via the TrueYou page. Another afterparty calls for another unusual talk. This time with an employee who works in iris scanning and tracking, boasting about how they can save children from predators with their technology. Mae is amazed until she is told that it is not through a worn bracelet but a chip implemented in the bone. While Mae is trying to make sense of what she heard she spots the same guy from last time, busy on his phone once again. When she walks up the stairs to greet him he shoves his phone in his pocket and after they exchange a few words he suggests showing her something to which she complies and heads downstairs. Upon introducing her to where the data is stored the guy reveals his identity as Ty Laffite, creator of TrueYou. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t approve of monetizing personal data and discarding privacy. Mae is shocked but she accepts to keep this encounter a secret. The next day Mae has a visitor, Mercer, who has been receiving death threats for being a deer killer upon the picture that Mae shared with the group. Upset, Mae trespasses to get the kayak at night and goes into an agitated bay. She is knocked off her kayak and is holding on for dear life,when a helicopter and rescuers save her. According to them, it was thanks to the SeeChange cameras that she was spotted and saved. What follows is an interview held by Bailey where Mae talks about how frightening her experience was and that it was thanks to the SeeChange Cameras that she was saved. Then through a smart manipulative speech Bailey comes to the conclusion that everything should be shared, it is selfish not to share, and that secrets are lies. Mae Holland is the first subject to have a portable SeeChange camera 24/7. Within the ecstatic crowds applauding his initiative we notice a very distraught Annie, unlike her previous enthusiastic self and also a disappointed Ty. And so, Mae is being watched from waking up in the morning and doing her most basic hygiene routine up to making calls with her parents, and her day at work. She is in her 3rd week of transparency with 2.3 million viewers currently watching. When she\xe2\x80\x99s back at her dorm room she checks on her folks through their camera and catches them being intimate, for the whole world to see. Mae is embarrassed but tries to brush it off. She tries checking on them again but their cameras are disconnected. The following day, on her way around campus, Mae spots Annie but the latter avoids her and keeps walking till Mae calls her by her full name. Mae has 3 mins off of video for bathroom usage and that\xe2\x80\x99s where she gets to have a private talk with haggard Annie who tells Mae that she\xe2\x80\x99s way deep in and there are things she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t realize. During a meeting about vote registration, Mae suggests taking it up a notch and make it mandatory for everyone to vote through Circle, for ideally democratic countries where everybody\xe2\x80\x99s voice is heard. Annie tries to knock sense into her during the meeting but to no avail. On the other hand, the idea of glorifying the circle through this initiative is more than welcomed by Bailey. Mae is then given the spotlight as she announces during a conference that her idea is now possible as 22 countries have agreed to it. During the same conference, she introduces SoulSearch: a way to find anyone anytime, under twenty minutes. And so she gives a demo by looking for a fugitive that ends up being found through the eyes of the billions of people using The Circle. That only fuels the exhilarating crowd who wants more and is now suggesting Mercer. Mae declines the shouting crowd\xe2\x80\x99s demands but Bailey steps in and forces her to do it. Ty is watching the full conference. Mercer is found by strangers around the forest , they try to barge in his house while calling him a deer killer. Mercer manages to get in his car but they go as far as following him. The pursuit ends tragically with Mercer drifting off the bridge down a ravine and dying. Mae is grieving back at her parents\xe2\x80\x99 home for 4 days. She calls Annie who\xe2\x80\x99s in Scotland, she tries to convince her to back off the Circle, especially after what happened, but Mae seems brainwashed and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t hold The Circle accountable, and still believes that the services can be improved to avoid such accidents. On her way back to work, she calls Ty. Mae declines Bailey and Tom\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion of taking another position with a more flexible schedule like Ty Laffite and she just enforces the fact that a fund should be set for Mercer's family. Ty calls Mae and they meet underground by the cloud storage. He tells Mae that he did what she instructed and that he discovered so many things way more dangerous than he thought and that Mercer\xe2\x80\x99s death could be a game changer. Mae nods and heads back to the conference hosted by Bailey. Mae joins the discussion and calls Tom to join the stage as well. She goes on about how Mercer could\xe2\x80\x99ve been still alive if they had never lost contact to begin with, through accessible locating and information anywhere anytime. She then holds up two SeeChange cameras and turns to Bailey and Tom asking them to be fully transparent as well. The men are taken aback but it only gets worse for them as Mae discloses their personal files, secret ones and even encrypted ones and sends them to the crowds. That marks the ends of the two as Mae rises to be the new leader for a better Circle. The last scene is Mae kayaking on the Bay with a couple of drones hovering over her. The image then zooms out to reveal hundreds of video shots from different countries and different people. That\xe2\x80\x99s quite the ending that leaves unanswered questions: Was Mae in it with Ty all along trying to throw Bailey off? What changes will Mae make to the Circle? Will privacy be forever lost? The end. Thank you for watching! Subscribe if you'd like to see more videos like this.
