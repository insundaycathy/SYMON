If a mad scientist abducted you and sowed your mouth to another person\xe2\x80\x99s anus, what would you do? Jesus christ, what have I gotten myself into. There\xe2\x80\x99s no way this video is monetized. In this How to Beat video, we\xe2\x80\x99ll follow the American tourists, see if we can make better decisions, and ultimately attempt to beat the EVIL SURGEON in, THE HUMAN CENTIPEDE (FIRST SEQUENCE). Think you could do better, let us know in the comments! Enjoy these How To Beat videos? Why not like and subscribe. Have a movie you want me to cover? Vote on my reddit page, link in the description. If you guys want me to do the sequels, let me know. Alright, let\xe2\x80\x99s take this evil fucker down. We start out following a deranged man sitting on the side of the highway, caressing a picture of, as far as I can tell, a dog-centipede. Totally normal behavior. Moments later a panicked truck driver pulls up behind him and rushes off into the bushes to make a pit stop. According to the director, the inspiration for this movie came from a joke he made with friends about punishing a child molester by stitching his mouth to the anus of a fat truck driver. Which is exactly what I\xe2\x80\x99d say to deflect further inspection from my perverted psyche, but it\xe2\x80\x99s interesting that they chose to add a truck driver into the movie. Taco Tuesday was not kind to this fella, and now he\xe2\x80\x99s going to pay the ultimate price for it. Besides not eating questionable food before a long haul, there\xe2\x80\x99s not much this poor truck driver could have done differently. As a general point though, you should never travel too far off the beaten path to use one of nature\xe2\x80\x99s dunnys. Privacy be damned. How many horror movies have you seen where someone ventures out of their camp at night to take a leak, and gets mauled. A lot, right? How many video games have you played where you hid in the bushes and waited for some dipshit to wander off by themselves so you could slit their throat. Probably too many to be good for your mental health. Being alone with your pants at your ankles just makes you the perfect target for predators. Again, not saying the truck driver did anything wrong here, just wanted to make this point. Our main protagonists are two ditzy American tourists, Lindsay and Jenny. Of course those are their names. These two bimbos accepted an invite to a party in the middle of nowhere by a random German waiter they just met. They obviously didn\xe2\x80\x99t see the movie Taken. Going to this \xe2\x80\x98party\xe2\x80\x99, which is likely a honeypot for human traffickers, was a bad idea to begin with, even if it was in an easily found public location. But the fact that this place is so remote should be a massive red flag. I mean, I guess they could have been invited to a forest rave party or something.. Even then, they have no cell reception, they are following a paper map, and they both know they are ill-equipped to deal with any level of adversity. They should have headed back home as soon as they left the urban areas. It\xe2\x80\x99s no surprise that they get lost, but then to add accident to idiocy, they hit a pothole and pop their tire. Not that they have many options here, and I think they \xe2\x80\x98should\xe2\x80\x99 ask the next person they see for help, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t help but be suspicious of the first person that arrives to help you minutes after you hit something. Whatever, I'm probably just being paranoid. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure this guy will be helpful and call some help for them or give them a lift into town. Okay, maybe wait for the next person. They can\xe2\x80\x99t be too far out. There should be more cars coming by within half an hour. They just need to sit tight and not do anything irrational. They\xe2\x80\x99re going to do something irrational, aren\xe2\x80\x99t they. Yep. They decide that in order to save themselves, they need to start walking aimlessly through the adjacent forest in their heels while it\xe2\x80\x99s thunderstorming. You guys got lost when you had a map in front of you, and now somehow think that you\xe2\x80\x99ll magically find your way without the map in a dark rainy forest? Why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you at least walk alongside the road where you\xe2\x80\x99d actually have a chance at coming across someone? I can already tell I'm going to be rooting for the psycho surgeon. Yah, go ahead and stitch her up behind the fat truck driver, actually, go ahead and put her at the very end. Cool, thanks. They eventually find a house and start yelling and banging on the backdoors and windows, which is a great way to scare the hell out of the homeowner and get you shot. The homeowner opens up and asks if they are alone, to which they answer, yes. Wrong move, and a red flag. The only reason he\xe2\x80\x99d need to know if you were alone is if he had sinister intentions and wanted to make sure nobody would come looking if something happened to you. Well, maybe not the only reason. He may be genuinely concerned if you had another friend that needed help as well. But considering the creepy look on his face, I doubt it. Lindsay and Jenny should just leave with the bad vibes this dude\xe2\x80\x99s giving off, or at least said that their other friend was just up the street by the car and knows they came here. The next mistake they made was to trust the stranger to make the call for help instead of using the phone themselves so they could verify that someone knew where they were and was on the way. The final nail in their coffin was throwing back the drinks some old single creepy looking dude prepared by himself in the kitchen, when they know he knows nobody knows where they are, and they already had an encounter with the creepy \xe2\x80\x98good samaritans\xe2\x80\x99 of this area. I get that he\xe2\x80\x99s an unhinged sociopath, but bro, if you want to claim some prey maybe chill out and stop yelling at the ladies. As for Lindsay and Jenny. Leave. Now. Especially since you\xe2\x80\x99re suspiciously feeling woozy all the sudden after sipping on the cocktail he gave you. Lindsay whispers to Jenny that they need to get out of there right now, which they don\xe2\x80\x99t do. Instead, Jenny gulps down every last drop of the drink while Lindsay waits for the sociopath to come back so she can naively request for him to phone a Taxi. Not the sharpest tools in the shed. Heiter comes back, Jenny passes out, Lindsay starts foaming at the mouth, and their last chance to escape with their dignity intact disappears forever. The next morning Lindsays the first to wake up and come to grips with how badly they fucked up. You never want to wake up in a hospital bed, but you \xe2\x80\x98never\xe2\x80\x99 want to wake up in a hospital bed in someone\xe2\x80\x99s basement. Needless to say, they need to get the fuck out of there ASAP. Luckily Heiter\xe2\x80\x99s not present. He might be out of the house or he might be upstairs. Either way, it\xe2\x80\x99s best to stay quiet, let him think you\xe2\x80\x99re still sedated, and use this opportunity to attempt an escape. For that reason, Lindsay shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t wake Jenny up yet because she\xe2\x80\x99ll just start freaking out and screaming. It looks like he secured them with non-locking leather restraints around their limbs, which weren\xe2\x80\x99t sufficiently spaced apart to prevent torso and head movement. Absolute rookie mistake. There\xe2\x80\x99s so many proven effective restraint setups out there, and this guy uses the absolute worst one possible. All Lindsay needs to do is use her mouth to unbuckle the restraint and she\xe2\x80\x99s free. But no, ineffectually squirming and waking up her brainless friend is definitely a better idea. Jenny\xe2\x80\x99s yelping brings Heiter\xe2\x80\x99s attention, ruining their chance of escaping yet again. Heiter then compares their blood types, and concludes that the truck driver\xe2\x80\x99s doesn\xe2\x80\x99t match so he needs to euthanize him and find a replacement. Gotta make sure the blood and tissues match when conjoining three people together ATM-style, because longevity is really what the goal is here. The shining silver lining of the truck driver's untimely death is that it buys the girls some time before Heiter finds a replacement for whatever sadistic shit he\xe2\x80\x99s planning. They don\xe2\x80\x99t show it here, but later in the movie Heiter injects them with sedatives when he leaves. He probably did that here too, so Lindsay and Jenny wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be able to undo the shackles and escape. Heiter leaves them to go bury the truck driver in his backyard in broad daylight with the corpse in an unzipped plastic body bag. Bro, could you not wait until nighttime, or chop him up and put him in black hefty bags instead of an obvious looking body bag? I wonder if YouTube will play Hefty trash bag ads on this video now. Then he drags a new victim in through his front door, again, in broad daylight with the murder weapon on the roof of the car. I get that he lives in a secluded area, but still, why take the risk. After securing the Japanese tourist on a gurney he wakes them up and gives them the projector presentation outlining how he\xe2\x80\x99s going to connect them together via the gastric system, creating a human centipede of sorts. There\xe2\x80\x99s no point in telling them this ahead of time, but he\xe2\x80\x99s a sick fuck and probably gets off on it. He\xe2\x80\x99s now going to put them under general anesthesia in preparation for their surgery, starting with the Japanese tourist. Now is your absolute last chance to fight and pull something off before your life is forever fucked. Lindsay wises up and unshackles herself while Heiter is distracted with Katsuro. She makes a conscious decision to leave her friend behind and run for the exits, but they\xe2\x80\x99re all locked. Of course this guy has his house setup so that people can\xe2\x80\x99t get out. Heiter is like a far more depraved version of Alex from the movie Tau. She locks herself in his bedroom which stalls him for now, but she needs to at least grab a weapon so she has a chance if it comes to a hand to hand fight. Wow, Heiter really has a picture of his dog centipede thing next to his bed. Instead of pleading for your life to the psychopath who gets off on people pleading for their life, how about you go over to the phone next to his bed and call 112, which is the 911 equivalent for Americans. Which you should know if you\xe2\x80\x99re visiting other countries. She tries to make an escape out the back window, but Heiter\xe2\x80\x99s one step ahead of her, and he has his tranq rifle. Without knowing the layout of the place and Heiter right behind her, it\xe2\x80\x99s understandable that she\xe2\x80\x99d accidentally run into a dead end like the indoor pool. It\xe2\x80\x99s also understandable that you\xe2\x80\x99d lose your coordination when under extreme stress like this and trip into the pool like she did. I know we all would like to think we\xe2\x80\x99d Jason Bourne this motherfucker when he stepped through the doorway, but real talk, no. Lindsay\xe2\x80\x99s out of options here, if she gets out of the pool she\xe2\x80\x99ll get tranq\xe2\x80\x99d. Heiter tries to force her out by closing the cover on his indoor pool, but for some reason this causes a power failure. I see no reason why he would have needed to leave Lindsay to fix the power and let her escape. This was really stupid on his part. Lindsay breaks out and makes it back to the room she was previously in that had the window broken. That phone looks like a corded landline phone, which should still work even with the power out. Picking up the phone to call for help apparently never crosses her mind though. This wide open window seems too easy, but then again, why did he let her leave the pool in the first place. Maybe he isn\xe2\x80\x99t as smart as he appears. He could still be out there with a tranq rifle, ready to dart her as soon as she exits. The odds are in her favor though. Dart guns, like the one Heiter\xe2\x80\x99s using, are single shot and take time to reload. The darts are relatively low velocity, and have a hard time puncturing thick clothing. If she wrapped the bed sheet around herself and ran for it, even if he was out there, there\xe2\x80\x99s a good chance he would miss or it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t puncture her, at which point she can leave the bedsheet and sprint for it. Heiter\xe2\x80\x99s home is not that isolated, if she sprinted 100 yards in any direction she\xe2\x80\x99d probably run into someone. She just needs to take care not to trip on a branch and bop her head off a log. Even if she did get hit and it punctured her skin. She\xe2\x80\x99d still have maybe 3-5 minutes to run for help before she lost a significant amount of her coordination from the tranquilizer. Lindsay hesitates, conflicted with her chance to escape and not wanting to leave Jenny behind. Going back for Jenny is a bad idea. Both Jenny and Katsuro are under general anaesthetics in the basement. Heiter will be back soon, and there\xe2\x80\x99s no way she could drag them up the stairs and haul them to safety in time. She needs to secure her own escape first, from there, it should only take 20 minutes tops to bring the fuzz down on top of Heiter\xe2\x80\x99s operation. If you did want to go back and try to carry her out, the most effective way is to use the ranger roll and firemen\xe2\x80\x99s carry method. Too much friction dragging her on the ground, and way too slow. She manages to get Jenny\xe2\x80\x99s unconscious body topside and out the window, but it\xe2\x80\x99s taking too long and she\xe2\x80\x99s too loud. I\xe2\x80\x99d say a tranq round will hit her in the back of the neck here any moment now. Should have just ran and left Jenny. And realistically, she still could since the tranq will take a few minutes to kick in. Of course he\xe2\x80\x99d probably be able to run her clumsy ass down anyway. Lindsay and Jenny gave up every opportunity to escape, and now they\xe2\x80\x99re getting their teeth removed, skin grafted, body parts dice and sewed together with other humans, and all kinds of other horrific shit. Fun times. Heiter then cheers to his successful completion of the conjoinment procedure with a celebratory drink, a photoshoot he can wank to later, then puts the human centipede into a large cage on the first floor of his house for some dumb reason. Escaping at this point is going to be.. Tough. There\xe2\x80\x99s no way to effectively coordinate strategies or movements with the others while they are conjoined. They could potentially rip out the stitches by pulling with their head and hands to separate themselves, but their ligaments and tendons in their knees were sliced so it\xe2\x80\x99s not like they could run anyways. Heiter brings them outside to parade them around the lawn like dogs. I get his house may be secluded, but Lindsay and Jenny stumbled into it. It\xe2\x80\x99s not that secluded. He must not give a shit about being caught. Can you imagine the rage inside you if someone did this to you, desperately wanting to destroy him, being so close but being completely unable to do anything. Katsuro does still have his arms intact. If he gets close enough he could pull the doc to the ground and choke him out. That\xe2\x80\x99s about their only option right now. That night, Heiter threatens to cut their vocal cords if they don't quit their moaning because it\xe2\x80\x99s disturbing his sleep. Yah, it\xe2\x80\x99s best to just shut up, you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to lose your vocal cords now when you might need them to escape later. The next morning he gives them a checkup. Katsuro and Lindsay are surviving, but Jenny doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look too good. Besides the massive infections she\xe2\x80\x99s developing, there\xe2\x80\x99s no way anything nutritious is finding its way back there, let alone enough water. Jenny probably only has a couple days left. Someone rings his landline, so Heiter picks up the phone right outside his torture chamber filled with moaning and screaming victims. Smart. Maybe you\xe2\x80\x99d want to pick up one of the other phones in the house to answer calls, or just let them leave a message while you\xe2\x80\x99re torturing people. It\xe2\x80\x99s the police, letting him know that they are at the front door and he needs to open up. Gee, it couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be that they acquired evidence pointing to him as a suspect in the recent abductions with how inconspicuous he was. The police obviously don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything substantial yet though, or they\xe2\x80\x99d have barged in already. They also don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to have heard any of the screaming in the background. Such amazing detectives. Heiter leaves to go upstairs, leaving them in the lab alone. I bet there is a weapon in there they could grab, like a scalpel. Then all he needs to do is grab Heiter\xe2\x80\x99s leg and start shanking him in the femoral artery enough to get him on the ground where he can cut his throat. The police start questioning him over the missing people and empty cars in the area, and his reply is... The police had thought they hit a dead end, but now it\xe2\x80\x99s looking like they have a strong suspect. I mean, on the other hand, you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily expect an abductor to be such an asshole, because often it's the more unassuming and charming ones that are the real danger. Like Jack the Ripper, Ted Bundy, Alex in Tao, or Trinity in Dexter. If I was a detective, I'd be suspicious already. Especially after seeing this cage. Apparently the detectives got word that a witness said she heard an American woman screaming on his property and they also have evidence that his Mercedez was at the place where the dutch lorry where he killed the truck driver was found. Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t all this be grounds for a search warrant? Heiter realizes they are on to him, so he offers them his infamous drink. Yah, that\xe2\x80\x99ll get the cops off your tail. Two missing detectives and an empty cop car in your driveway. Drinking whatever a potential suspect gives you has to be a big no no for detectives. Detective Voller starts sipping on it, but at least Detective Kranz has the brains to refuse it. Sweet mother of god, they spent this whole time screaming when a fucking scalpel was right next to them. If I was Lindsay, I'd probably want to get the scalpel and cut Katsuro\xe2\x80\x99s ass from my face so I could have a chance at fighting on my own, and without Lindsay attached to his ass katsuro could better fight Heiter too. I say this, but it would be absurdly painful. I think I'd at least try given the situation. I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure they have a ton of time to do this, so having Katsuro palm the scalpel and ambush Heiter is the best option. The police question him about his cellar, and the he jokes about it being a torture chamber. That\xe2\x80\x99s always a good thing to say to cops when being questioned about recent abductions. The detectives ask to take a look down there, but Heiter refuses, saying they need a search warrant first. Detective Kranz presses him further, and Heiter accidentally drops a syringe on the ground. Supposedly for his Diabetes. By now we\xe2\x80\x99ve clearly established that the surgeon is a psycho who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t give a fuck about people going missing, witnesses saying they\xe2\x80\x99ve heard American women screaming on his property, which match the profile of 2 of the people who went missing, his car was spotted next to the location of the truck whose driver was abducted, a large suspicious cage with blood on it, incredibly weird pictures and art, a cellar which the violent suspect refuses to let you into. Oh and he was hiding a syringe under a towel which is filled with god knows what. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know German law, or law in general, but I\xe2\x80\x99d think they have sufficient probable cause to easily get a search warrant. Which they do. I\xe2\x80\x99d also call for some additional backup considering he\xe2\x80\x99s been pretty volatile. While the cops are out getting a search warrant, Heiter goes back downstairs to try and hide his human triplet. Tall task with only 20 minutes before they\xe2\x80\x99re back. Guys what the fuck, you had him. Why would you not finish the job. A shank to the leg and a bite on the neck is nowhere near lethal. How hard is it to pull the scalpel out of his leg and slice his jugular and shove it into his heart. Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you want to ensure that he\xe2\x80\x99s 100% dead for what he did to you, and so he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t come back after you. Surprise surprise, Heiter\xe2\x80\x99s not dead and corners them in the bedroom. Just when you think you\xe2\x80\x99re going to see a human centipede versus Heiter knife-fight, Katsuro gives up. He has some sort of epiphany that his ass being sewed to someone else\xe2\x80\x99s face was God\xe2\x80\x99s wrath for living a selfish life and not loving his family more. So he kills himself. Because that makes sense. You know what\xe2\x80\x99s selfish, not killing this guy and freeing the two innocent people trapped behind you, condemning them to death because you wanted to commit seppuku to rid yourself of sin. You could have at least tried to save their lives and take this evil fuck down before committing suicide. The doc leaves the triplet and crawls back over to the pool as the police break in and search the place. Looks like they didn\xe2\x80\x99t call for backup. Detective Voller should have been feeling the effects of the drugs by now. At which point he should have let his partner know so they could call off the raid and get backup. Voller didn\xe2\x80\x99t communicate this and tried to push through the effects, and wound up dead in the pool with a scalpel in his neck. Kranz hears the fall into the pool, rushes in halfcocked, and gets lit up. I never understood why when people open a door and see a dead body, the rush right over to it. Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t that make you take a pause and carefully clear the area, checking all your corners. Obviously the wounded man who killed your friend is still down here and is still a threat, so hastily running in there would likely get you killed too. At least he dome-shotted Heiter before he keeled over. The movie ends with Lindsay stuck in the middle of a dead Katsuro and a dead Jenny, with two dead cops and a dead Heiter in the pool. We can presume that Lindsay was later found by other cops who went looking after the missing detectives, and they brought her to a hospital where a surgeon separated her from the rest of the human centipede. She then would go on to get plastic surgery to fix her face, as well as operations to replace the ligaments in her kneecaps and her teeth, paid for by Dr. Heiter\xe2\x80\x99s money. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it amazing that nowadays you could get brutally disfigured, I mean utterly rekted, and there\xe2\x80\x99s a building you can go to with people in it who have the tools and expertise to fix all the damage done to you. It\xe2\x80\x99s honestly incredible. She won\xe2\x80\x99t be winning any beauty pageants and she\xe2\x80\x99ll have to lower her dating standards substantially, but at least she could live a semi normal life, maybe get a book deal and make some talk show appearances until she later decides to kill herself due to the overwhelming survivors guilt and PTSD. Let\xe2\x80\x99s recap who would have lived or died with some different decisions. Firstly, I want to say RIP to Dieter Laser, who passed away last year. No, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to put Dieter Laser on the Dead board, that would be senseless. Guys, I'm actually a fairly empathetic person. But back to the movie. The trucker was dead no matter what. Lindsay and Jenny should have stayed in their car or walked along the road for help. Which would have prevented all of this. But, Heiter could have picked them up like he did with Katsuro and the truck driver, so what then? There was a pivotal moment when Lindsay could have dialed 112 and escaped out the back window and gotten help from the police, but instead tried to drag her unconscious friend out too. She could have saved Jenny and Katsuro\xe2\x80\x99s lives, prevented the detective\xe2\x80\x99s deaths, and landed Heiter in prison. The next pivotal moment was when Katsuro stabbed Heiter with the scalpel and then they left him alive. If they had just ensured Heiter was dead, Katsuro and Jenny might have lived, as well as the cops. All said and done, I think we could have beaten the EVIL SURGEON from HUMAN CENTIPEDE. Thanks for watching, and remember, don\xe2\x80\x99t ask strangers for help without having a plan to kill them.
