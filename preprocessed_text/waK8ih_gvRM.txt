[Music]. we happy few is a game packed with twists, turns and a well-crafted campaign offers an eerie insight into an alternative diamond shoot. the single player story can last anywhere up to 25 hours and beyond, but there's a quick way to skip the entire game in under just 2 minutes. the others who like wasting 40 pounds can simply start the game and do the following. after beginning heart this story, the player will come across an article referencing the character's brother Percy. due to the pain of this could cause, Arthur is given a choice to either take a joy pill and remove the sadness, or to refuse one. whilst most gamers will probably instinctively fight against the system and begin the game by avoiding the pill, it's still a nice choice to offer them that is reminiscent of alternate game endings such as Arkham City and Far Cry 4. to me, this is a great reference to the film the matrix, in which the character neo was offered the choice of taking the blue or red pill and journeying outside of the world that has been pulled over his eyes, or remaining in it. the game is packed with Easter eggs like this. and it's definitely an interesting journey through a drug-fueled society that relies on short-term highs to make it through a mundane day-to-day life. so have you played through me happy fuse campaign yet? or did you take the easy way out? comment below and let me know. and if you enjoyed this video, then please like it and subscribe to my channel. make sure you check out my website, Definition core at UK for more movie games and TV insights. thanks again for taking the time to watch this.
