of their son, adam, as a baby. christine cries, but she doesn't remember him. as she goes through the photos, she sees his birth certificate and a note in his handwriting. ben takes back the photos, and later christine makes another video in which she says that while the grief might not be new for ben, it is for her, and it will be new every other day for the rest of her life. christine has another nightmare about the man with a scar in her attack. she wakes up terrified. then watches her recordings about adam and cries. christine begins taking apart the wall of photos in the bathroom. when she talks to nash again, she asks if he knew about her son, and he tells her that they have spoken about him before. she has begun thinking that maybe it's better if she doesn't learn about everything. christine asks the doctor if they can just sit there for a while, then asks if she should tell ben about the therapy. that night, her and ben talk about adam again. she asks if she was a good mother before the accident, ben says that she loved him very much, and she has a memory about him for a moment. christine says that she understands how difficult it must be for ben to go to all of it over and over, but tells him not to hide her son from her. again, he apologizes to her. that night, christine has another nightmare. she's in a hotel and she can see her son there. she finds a note that has the name mike on it, and then remembers the man with the scar again. lastly, she remembers parts of the attack. christine awakens and forgets everything again. christine is in the car with dr nash, going somewhere. when they stop, she tells him the name mike, saying that he's the man that hurt her. the doctor comforts her and leans in to kiss her. when she sees that his name is mike, she remembers him as striking her in the hotel room, so she runs from the car. he gets a syringe from his trunk and runs after her on the lawn pier, eventually catching up to her. later, christine is on her couch when her phone rings. she answers the call from dr nash. and he explains that he gave her a sedative to calm her, not put her to sleep. she remembers. he tells her that she was confused and suffering from fabulation about him, placing all her fears and suspicions on him. before he hangs up, he says that he had found out something about ben that he will have to explain to her in person. ben arrives at the house and they have dinner together. he asks her who she was talking to on the phone when he tried to call her, and she lies, saying she was calling him the next day. christine is listening to dr nash explain how vulnerable patients like her can develop feelings for their psychiatrists. what is less common is for the psychiatrist to develop feelings for their patients. he says that's unprofessional. she thinks that he's her only hope and that they're making progress. when he tells her that he will refer her to a colleague, dr nash thinks that treating her further would be unethical. but he thinks that her progress is noticeable because she had remembered to watch the recording even before he had called her. that morning. next he tells her that he found out that ben had her transferred from an asylum to a nursing home. the doctor managed to talk to the administrator, who told him that her friend claire had been trying to get in touch with her. he gives her claire's number. the administrator also told nash that ben had divorced her four years prior later, christine calls claire and leaves her a message saying that she really needs to talk to her. she goes to see ben at his work. when she asks if they're divorced, he gets angry, but she pushes for the truth. ben tells her that it's because of the death of their son. first he walked away from her, but he had come back, and he will never leave her again. that same day, claire calls christine back. she remembers bits and pieces about her as claire tells her that she had kept ringing the nursing home where christine was placed. she tells her that she misses her and want to see her. they arrange a meeting at an observatory. in an hour, christine goes to see claire and waits for her on a bench. when claire shows up, christine remembers her. they've missed each other very much. christine asks claire if she was a good mother, and she replies that she was great. ben was also a good father. she asks her friend who did that to her? they grab a drink, and claire tells her that she was probably having an affair. she confessed it to her eventually, but never gave her any details about the man. claire apologizes to her for telling ben, but she had to do it since she had already told the police. christine thinks that that's the reason why ben never talks to her about anything, including her claire tells her that after her accident, she tried to help ben out, and the two of them spent a lot of time together, eventually sleeping together. she decided to stay away from them because of that. before christine leaves, she gives her a note that ben left for her with claire if she was ever good enough to read and understand it. the letter explains the reasons why he left her. in it, ben says that the main reason was the happiness and well-being of their son, who couldn't bear seeing her like that anymore. christine finishes the letter as ben arrives at the house. she records a video in which she is talking to ben, telling him that by the time he sees the video, he will know everything, including that the only thing she feels for him is love. later, christine shows ben the video she recorded for him and starts telling him about everything that has been happening in the previous weeks. she tells him about dr nash, and he's angry that she kept that from him. when she tells him that she forgives him, that she loves him, he hits her. christine calls claire and tells her what has happened with ben. she says that she'll call him and call christine right back. in the meantime, she records a video in which she says that he hit her. claire calls her back and tells her that ben has been living alone and hasn't seen her in four years. she asks her to describe ben to her. their descriptions don't match. claire tells her that ben has a scar on the side of his face. and christine has a flashback the bend she knows comes back. and she runs to the bathroom to check the photos if he has a scar. when she doesn't see one. claire tells her that the man she's living with has not been suddenly, christine notices that all of the photographs on the wall are doctored.

ben suddenly grabs her. christine wakes up the following morning in her bed with ben. she walks inside the bathroom and sees the photos, then walks out to find him sitting on the bed, telling her who he is. when he leaves, the doctor calls her and tells her to find the camera. she only sees the recording where she says that she loves ben. after that, she notices the bruise on her cheek. the phone rings, and it's been this time, asking if everything is okay. he has her cell phone, which player is trying to reach ben reminds her to pack for their anniversary. she tells him that she loves him.

that attacked her. he tells her that he hates himself for what happened and begs her not to leave. christine is scared because she remembers details about the night when he attacked her. mike keeps begging her not to leave, but then steps aside to see if she will. and when she does, he hits her again. he tells her that they will either leave together or they won't leave at all. then he begins to delete all of her recordings from the camera, tells her that she's free. mike tells her to kiss him, and she does it out of fear. he tells her that she has to forget ben and adam, because they have forgotten her. christine realizes that adam isn't dead, and he starts beating her up again. she fights back, but he overpowers her and begins to strangle her. christine stabs him and tries to escape,
