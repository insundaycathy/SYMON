I can't remember what, I can't even remember the Bible. look at the story of out of a need, the fruit of good and evil, whatever the hell it was, the forbidden fruit. that's what he's eating cuz he look like Adam.

I'm saying, I'm just saying, Omar Sharif before Omar Sharif. in this picture alone, I got you thought that must actually look nothing. okay, look, if you take clotting, good, if you take Clark Gable's original teeth and put them in Laurence Olivier's mouth, that's all.

Oh, what is wrong with y'all? on oh, no, no, I saw that picture. what was the first thing you saw? the first thing I saw was that mouth hanging open - yeah. and then I think the second thing I saw was a dog. yeah. it's funny, cuz his mouth isn't even really open, but I think you imagined it being open, cuz that's how bad this picture was. worse is he uploaded it. what's worse is that there should be a tear coming out of his eyes. it's like when you, you know why he posted this? he boasted the sign. look that. no, he posted this on Instagram. it's not him trying to look fat. it's like when you got a jelly roll so you stopped making fat jokes. it's like saying, I'm old before other people say, I'm old, before they say, you're old. yeah, exactly. yeah. exactly. don't want to say I'm yeah. number eight, George Michael, is it coming? there is? all right, now, y'all. and this is one of the few men on this earth that I wish I could look like. what about you, spud? you won't look like him. no laughter.

Bruce Lee, ooh. he like a flaming fist to the face. number ten, Yul Brynner, bad mother. I don't know how okay this is. I don't like how many rings he's got. it's funny, because if you look at this face for too long and at the right angle, he's not good-looking, but he's just so [ __ ] bad-ass. I mean, I look, they have Steve McQueen on the other list, and Steve McQueen was not hot. so we can put your beretta in here for battery. number 11, Paul. Paul Newman, yeah, I'd say so we're right. yeah, yeah, yeah, I think so. yeah, yeah, I see it and I get it. yeah, their face is disgustingly symmetrical. don't you agree? like, when I see that, I'm like, but that's something you live in. that's a [ __ ] house that you even grew the same numbers on each side of his head. yeah, yeah, it's exactly. I'm surprised this herring potted right down the middle, like, his face is too ridiculously swear. I'm surprised he can all only, you couldn't only ever look straight? Yeah, right. exactly. exactly. yeah. like you should have existed on the equator, half on each side of the planet, exactly. ever be looking straight, only ever walk on it. that's, that's ridiculous. just get the [ __ ] out of here, Paul. number 12, James, do you that's not good. that looks like a professor. it does. maybe that's what happened. maybe he went made himself a magic potion and turned into, you know, a hot James Dean. oh, my god. what is wrong with it? what is wrong with y'all? hain't you know, I I'll bet you hipsters love him. yes, they do. I'm sure. I hope they do. but my god, oh, jesus, what? what numbers? I know it's trying to depth which number is it? I'm sorry.

Charlie Chaplin. all right. now, that's probably why mama's man put this picture in there, because John washes. probably people think Johnny invented that. would you want bet? I hope not. see. I always used to think the original scene was potatoes, but then I saw, in the movie, we really watched it, I saw it was rolls. but now, seeing that picture, I think it's potatoes in that scene, I think, I think it's potatoes. you can't tell me they're not, unless he said in the movie, these are rolls. it has to be potatoes. is, no, no, okay, sorry. it's not potatoes. it's spuds. next. number 14 is almost perfect. teeth. oh, wait. go back. go back. go back. all right. just keeps on, keeps on skipping around on us. oh, oh, hold on. no, no, oh, that tooth gap? no, I think the first thing that scared me was our bear. you know, what's funny, does that bowtie just scream swag, you know? see? all right, now, I'm looking at my eyes immediately went to that armpit. that's what I just said. yeah, yeah, breasts probably why we're in sync. anyway, my eyes went to that armpit because I personally am a man who does not let his armpit hair go astray. I keep it tended. and I think I give old Marsha props for being like me. he it looks like he didn't shave anything, you know, didn't know. look, if you don't buzz that, it's all over the place. that is clearly maintained armpit right now. good on you. Omar. looks like he's got back here. we're not even talking about what makes these men hot. we're just like, over analyzing the pictures. the spray makes it look like it got back here, too. that's why I last why looks wild, you know, ya know. and it's funny, cuz he looks wild with the hair, but the bowtie is like, faux civilized. yeah. well, he can doctor all over Mozgov Argo number 15, Frank Sinatra, so, oh, girl. alright. now, this is one. this is so weird, because this is what a mug shot of do to you. not that I know, but, but a mug shot will make you look cooler than you really are.

I couldn't get a picture of his right ear. and one that wasn't there. to get a picture of the left ear, they like, turn front. he turned to the left to show his right ear. and then they are like, you Frank, turn to the left. we go. show your bad side. number 16. Montgomery Clift, that's still Frank. what the hell is wrong with you? number 16? my girl was left another man who I would trade looks with, really. yeah.

Paul Noli. oh, you know, he's gonna hit a return winner. oh, you know. okay. now, we wanted to talk about this because I've said in the past that he looks like Robert De Niro, young Robert De Niro. and the Robert De Niro illness of his face is what keeps him from being ugly. also, he's number 23 on this list, correct? all right. I'm calling it right now - so how many tennis majors he's ending with? take it off, baby. this is why I like to see him win. it's not even for the glory. it's not for the accomplishment. it's for the hairy kiddies. take it off, roll like a beast and flaunt your fur. of people to hate you.
