If a rat bug bit you, then later that night you were attacked by a naked clone of yourself that was trying to kill and replace you, what would you do? In this video on Nerd Explains, we\xe2\x80\x99ll follow the characters, see if we can make better decisions, and ultimately attempt to beat the body snatchers in, Assimilate. If you think I missed something, or you have a better way to beat the aliens, let me know in the comments! We start out following two dudes giving us a tour of their self-proclaimed podunk town of Multon, Missouri. It\xe2\x80\x99s all pretty boring, usual stuff. Sure, Mrs. Bissette points out some strange insects in her garden, but she\xe2\x80\x99s a good-looking lady talking to high school boys, so we can safely assume the insects aren\xe2\x80\x99t grabbing their attention. These insects would only be alarming if you were an entomologist, otherwise you\xe2\x80\x99d just think they were some type of mini-ant. Across the street, a kid\xe2\x80\x99s screaming, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re not my mommy,\xe2\x80\x9d while his mom is dragging him down the sidewalk. Everyone in this small town knows each other, so they know she is, in fact, his mommy. Guessing by the title of the movie, this mom\xe2\x80\x99s already been assimilated and is actually an alien clone. The little kid is objectively correct, that ain\xe2\x80\x99t his mommy. But, the characters don\xe2\x80\x99t know the title of the movie they are in, so it\xe2\x80\x99s justifiable for them to assume he\xe2\x80\x99s just being a little jerk. (Look what ya did you little jerk). Besides Mrs. Bissette, underage football players getting booze and Randy\xe2\x80\x99s parents being abusive, there\xe2\x80\x99s not much cam-worthy content to record. Later that night, they\xe2\x80\x99re walking around throwing a frisbee, shooting the shit, until they hear a woman letting out blood curdling screams. They rush to check it out. It\xe2\x80\x99s Mrs. Bissette, their friendly neighborhood MILF. * I think we know what Zach and Randy need to do. They need to hit record and yell worldstar while Mrs. Bissette gets brutally assaulted so they can post it online and get views for their channel. (Worldstar) The door is unlocked, so naturally they invite themselves into the crime scene. * I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go in there. Unless you could visually see what was going on, or somehow make contact with her, it would be exceptionally dangerous to enter her home. She could mistake you for an intruder and shoot you, or whatever attacked her would attack you. If it was a homicide, entering the home could cause you to ruin evidence and mess up the crime scene, hell, you could even end up as a suspect by leaving your evidence at the scene. * Considering Mrs. Bissette stopped screaming, this could mean the threat either killed her or is no longer a threat. I\xe2\x80\x99d just stay outside, peep the windows, and call the cops while trying to make visual or audible contact with her. * If she kept screaming, which means she\xe2\x80\x99s not dead and the threat is still present, I might try to find something I could use as a weapon and try to find her. It really depends on if you want to risk dying for her, and how confident you are in your ability to defend yourself. * If Zach and Randy had taken our advice, and hadn\xe2\x80\x99t gone into her house, they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have known about the bite or Pastor Greg\xe2\x80\x99s rat bug, so it actually puts us in a worse position. But they\xe2\x80\x99d still most likely have realized something was wrong when they called the cloned sheriff and confronted the cloned Mrs Bissette about the incident the next day. So we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have completely screwed ourselves. They decide to go into her house anyway. There\xe2\x80\x99s a broken lamp and blood on the ground, a sure sign that Mrs Bissette is in a pickle. Randy calls the cops, but they just hang up on him. * I know this is a shitty town and the cop probably doesn\xe2\x80\x99t give much of a fuck, but come on. A loud thud and tapping noises start coming from the attic. * How have they not already grabbed something to use as a weapon, jesus. They continue to follow the blood trail, and open the closet door. It\xe2\x80\x99s Mrs. Bissette. She\xe2\x80\x99s bloody, crying, and claims something bit her. * I gotta tell ya, as soon as I hear this, I'm thinking zombies. (Zombies! Clip) A huge bug thing blasts out the drywall and flies out the window. Okay, well it\xe2\x80\x99s not zombies so that\xe2\x80\x99s good. Zach has the bright idea to chase the thing, because as he stated, it might have rabies. * How is that a reason to chase this thing, that\xe2\x80\x99s actually a strong reason to run the other way. The CDC explicitly states to not pet, approach, or engage any animal you suspect has rabies. This is because Rabies infections are nearly 100% fatal if left untreated until symptoms appear. It literally has the highest mortality rate of any disease on Earth. Mrs. Bissette just needs to go to a doctor, run some tests, and get a rabies vaccine. It\xe2\x80\x99s pretty obvious that we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t try to catch the rabid rat bug that\xe2\x80\x99s biting people and which we suspect has rabies. * We\xe2\x80\x99d definitely want to take Mrs. Bissette to the hospital to get some tests done to determine if she was bitten by a rabid animal. Since they use blood tests for rabies diagnosis, i\xe2\x80\x99m pretty positive the alien spores and DNA would be identified. They\xe2\x80\x99d likely keep her at the hospital for further testing and monitoring, as well as try to make contact with higher up authorities about the unidentified alien DNA in her bite wound. Later that night, her alien clone would probably arrive at the hospital to try to kill and replace her, at which point it would be very obvious that we, collectively, have a major problem. * Later on in the movie, it seemed like the clones showed up at night while their victims were sleeping in order to kill and replace them, though it\xe2\x80\x99s not clear how the clone finds the original. * My guess is that the bug releases a toxic pheromone that makes the victim sleepy, and the bug leaves a pheromone trail which the clone uses to find the original. The fully-formed existing clones might also help direct the newly birthed mindless clones and tell them when and where to attack. * This means that Mrs. Bissette\xe2\x80\x99s clone might not find and attack her at the hospital, since she was bit at home. Either way though, finding alien DNA in her wound would likely have sparked the chain of events required for awareness of an alien invasion to spread, and defenses to be orchestrated. * It\xe2\x80\x99s possible that all the doctors were already clones, and Mrs. Bissette would just be restrained on a gurney so her clone could Shang Tsung her. (Soul belongs to me) * I think Randy and Zach would\xe2\x80\x99ve helped take her to the hospital considering the circumstances, and if the doctors were clones, we\xe2\x80\x99d know something was up when they started acting weird, just like when we went to confront Pastor Greg. * It\xe2\x80\x99s also possible that they aren\xe2\x80\x99t able to get any alien DNA off of her. I doubt it though. * Taking Mrs. Bissette to the hospital would be the most reasonable decision that coincidentally has the best chance for everyone to find out what\xe2\x80\x99s going on, which is incredibly crucial when under siege by body snatching aliens. * Later on, I'll talk about our plans for survival once we do realize the threat we\xe2\x80\x99re facing. For now, let's see what Zach and Randy should do if they did stupidly chase the bug. Before they catch up to it, it scurries into, what I guess is it\xe2\x80\x99s owner\xe2\x80\x99s cooler? The man, with his pet bug, hop into a car and leave. As the car drives away, they see that Pastor Greg is the owner. * Uh, what the hell. So Pastor Greg has a pet insect rat thing that he lets go into people\xe2\x80\x99s homes and bite them? Like in the movie, we\xe2\x80\x99re definitely going to want to stalk him and get more information and footage of what the hell he is up to, as well as find out why the cop hung up on us. The next day they take their video to the douchebag from Never Back Down, but like all horror movies, the cop thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s photoshopped nonsense. * To be honest, I don\xe2\x80\x99t blame him. I think the kids should have known better that in this day and age, video evidence isn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly hard evidence that you can convict someone with. You need something physical, like the bite wound and testimony from a victim like Mrs Bissette. The night Mrs. Bissette was bitten and they saw Pastor Greg, I'd have 100% shown Mrs. Bissette the footage of Pastor Greg with the bug, and then taken her to the hospital as well as to the cops. This may have prevented her death and clone replacement that night, it\xe2\x80\x99d be easier to convince the cop something bad was happening, and the hospital might be able to identify the alien spores, triggering the awareness we need to construct our defenses. Again, it\xe2\x80\x99s our best shot and figuring out what\xe2\x80\x99s going on and spreading awareness. On their way to interrogate Pastor Greg for his rat shenanigans, they hear an eerie siren noise in the distance. * There\xe2\x80\x99s really nothing to make of it at this point though. The doors mysteriously close behind them while hallway lights flicker. Cool, maybe we should wait until Pastor Greg comes outside before interrogating him instead. Nope, okay cool let\xe2\x80\x99s just continue down this creepy corridor to confront the Pastor that siccs rabid rat bugs on people. What could go wrong. They eventually find Greg, and he\xe2\x80\x99s not his cheerful dorky self. He calls Randy\xe2\x80\x99s mom a slut and Zach\xe2\x80\x99s dad a junkie. To be fair, they did just accuse him of being a rat whisperer though. The sheriff who hung up on us is there too. He doesn't seem normal either. Zach and Randy quickly bug out of there. Get it. They check the internet and cell service. Everything is down. Zach and Randy just now think to see if Mrs. Bissette can help them prove to the cops that they aren\xe2\x80\x99t lying about the situation with Pastor Greg. Unfortunately, Mrs. Bissette isn\xe2\x80\x99t acting like herself either. She denies that anything happened last night, and pulls her skirt up to reveal her leg where she was bit, except there\xe2\x80\x99s no bite mark anymore. That same thud and tapping sound starts coming from her bedroom, which she suggestively invites them into. As hard of a decision as it was, Randy and Zach declined. They creep around the outside of the house to peep into the window. Looks like a couple guys already took her up on the offer. One of the male suitors jumpscares them, forcing Zach and Randy to retreat to the barn and reassess what is going on. What\xe2\x80\x99s weird is that they recognize the guy tied up on the bed, and it\xe2\x80\x99s the same guy that jumpscared them. Kayla shows up at their homebase to tell them that her dad is acting strange. Like there\xe2\x80\x99s no feeling in him, like he\xe2\x80\x99s a different person all of the sudden. To make matters worse, her Mom and brother are missing too. She thinks she\xe2\x80\x99s going crazy. But it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that this isn\xe2\x80\x99t a case of Capgras Syndrome, a psychiatric disorder where you feel like a loved one has been replaced by an imposter. While the three are out looking for her family, they notice that everyone is acting strange. People are blankly staring at them, and openly burning their belongings. Kayla's dad has gone batshit crazy as well, it\xe2\x80\x99s obvious that he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be any help. Zach fakes going to the bathroom so he can search the house for Kayla\xe2\x80\x99s brother and mom. He finds Joey in the attic, hiding from his Dad. Zach tells Joey to go downstairs to his room and hide. * Dude, the attic is a better hiding spot than his fucking room, what are you thinking. He also finds Kayla\xe2\x80\x99s mom, in the towel bin. Fuck. That\xe2\x80\x99s gonna be a tough one to explain to Kayla. * Shit just got real, people are getting murdered. (Bad Boys) * The first priority is to get Joey out of there. Leaving him with a murdering psychopath is not an option. * I\xe2\x80\x99m not exactly sure how i\xe2\x80\x99d handle this. To me, it seems like you have two options, either stealth it or get violent. * The stealth option. Leave the house without Joey to avoid confrontation with the dad. If we told Joey to stay in the attic, he should be relatively safe for now. Later in the movie, Joey was caught by his dad, but that was probably because Zach originally told him to hide in his room. By the time Zach left the bathroom, the dad was very agitated and suspicious. I doubt the dad would let Joey leave with them. Confronting him about the dead wife in the towel bin will provoke him to attack. Same thing with the neighbors. Whatever is going on, it\xe2\x80\x99s spreading insidiously, most likely originating with bites from that insect thing, and turning people into psychos. If we are confrontational, it could provoke them to attack us outright instead of slowly trying to decieve us. Kayla\xe2\x80\x99s mom may have confronted the dad so he killed her. If they think they can deceive us, that gives us time and the element of surprise. * How do we get Joey out secretly then? Have Kayla lure the dad out of the house by faking an emergency of some sort. Since the cell service and internet is down, we won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to do anything remotely. She could lure him outside by saying she thinks she has a flat tire or something. When he leaves the house, Zach and Randy, using Kayla\xe2\x80\x99s keys, could run in and grab Joey, while Kayla distracts the dad and watches the perimeter to ensure that he left and nobody else comes to the house. * The violent option. Whop the dad over the head with a flower vase before you leave, then grab Joey. It\xe2\x80\x99s 3v1. I think they could take him. This approach is dangerous, because we could get hurt in the altercation. But also, as we\xe2\x80\x99d come to find out, if we had confronted the dad clone, he\xe2\x80\x99d likely have screeched and brought the neighbor clones to attack us. They\xe2\x80\x99d have to knock him out cold in one blow. If they chose this method, Kayla\xe2\x80\x99s dad wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be able to move the mom\xe2\x80\x99s body, and if they brought the cop to the house, well, I think he will be sufficiently convinced of a problem. * I think stealth is the better approach if you can make it work, if not, then get yourself a lamppost and go to work. Either way, get Joey out of there immediately. * Once they have Joey, they need to get Zach and Randy\xe2\x80\x99s family to safety too. Zach\xe2\x80\x99s family first, as they just talked to them and know they aren\xe2\x80\x99t infected. Randy\xe2\x80\x99s family could be compromised, so let's save who we know we can first. They should stick together so they don\xe2\x80\x99t get isolated and overpowered. AKA, don\xe2\x80\x99t split up like cliche teenagers in horror movies. * They didn\xe2\x80\x99t originally believe them, but with Kayla, Joey and the video evidence, they might be able to convince them. It\xe2\x80\x99s not too late, it\xe2\x80\x99s still the same night, which means that we could save our parents before they get replaced by attacking clones, which we find out happened the next day in the movie. * Once we\xe2\x80\x99ve secured our home, we need to suit up. Since whatever is going on is probably spreading by bite and bloodborne infection, it\xe2\x80\x99s best that we wear things that prevent bites. Wearing layers of long pants and long sleeve shirts and jackets. Hiking boots, and some gloves when we're in more dangerous situations. We\xe2\x80\x99ll want to tuck our pants into our boots as well, to prevent the creature from scurrying up our pants. We\xe2\x80\x99ll look overdressed, but we won\xe2\x80\x99t be walking down the streets like Bill Williamson (*), which would probably get us unwanted attention. * With the tiny insects, the big insect, the bites, it might be some form or parasite that\xe2\x80\x99s taking hold of hosts in order to help it spread. If so, the parasite only has a basic connection with the host\xe2\x80\x99s nervous system, as they\xe2\x80\x99re unable to blend in well and express appropriate emotional responses. * The good news is that whatever it is, it\xe2\x80\x99s not hard to spot. The Thing or the arachnid bug from Starship troopers 2 were way better at keeping up appearances. All you have to do is say something that should elicit an emotional response, or just whatever horrible shit you normally filter out of conversations. If they act like a doorknob, it\xe2\x80\x99s probably an infected person. * Getting weapons to defend ourselves should also be a priority at this point as well. We don\xe2\x80\x99t want to kill anyone unless we have to, maybe this is a curable condition. But we also can\xe2\x80\x99t let ourselves succumb to whatever is infecting people. Again, you still want to blend in, so rolling down the streets like Hot Fuzz (*) might not be the best decision. I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying don\xe2\x80\x99t do it, because it would be cool as fuck. * Whatever\xe2\x80\x99s going on is way bigger than just Kayla\xe2\x80\x99s dad. The attacking bugs must be causing a parasitic infestation, or some form of viral infection that\xe2\x80\x99s affecting people\xe2\x80\x99s brains. * Almost everyone in the town is turning into murdering psychos. Which is bad for obvious reasons, but also because once a critical mass is attained, they won\xe2\x80\x99t really have to be sneaky anymore. Initially when it\xe2\x80\x99s only a few people, they can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to get found out, but with numbers, they can be more aggressive and will be more likely to outright attack you. * We need to get the word out to surrounding towns in order to contain the spread. If this gets out, it will exponentially take over the planet, unless it\xe2\x80\x99s happening everywhere already. We have to assume this is local and we can contain it, or else we\xe2\x80\x99re fucked anyways. * We still can\xe2\x80\x99t exactly go to the police. The sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s infected, and Ryan McCarthy doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to hear from us, and that\xe2\x80\x99s if he isn\xe2\x80\x99t infected too. No doubt Kayla\xe2\x80\x99s dad moved his wife\xe2\x80\x99s dead body as well, so we really don\xe2\x80\x99t have any hard proof of anything right now. It\xe2\x80\x99s just going to waste time. * We need to obtain some hard evidence. The footage we have could just be dismissed by other agencies and departments, like with our town\xe2\x80\x99s cop. * Initially I thought of abducting someone, but that\xe2\x80\x99s risky. I think a better way to get the word out would simply be to securely box up some of the weird alien ants that are everywhere and take it to the CDC headquarters in Atlanta, which is 10 hours away from Springfield, MO. Or a CDC Quarantine Station in Chicago, IL, which is 8 hours away. Further studying and testing of the alien ants, along with our footage and anecdotes would reveal their assimilation and duplication potential, which would trigger a quarantine, a worldwide PSA, and the creation of defensive strategies. I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking a good slogan for the PSA would be, \xe2\x80\x9cKnow Your Neighbor\xe2\x80\x9d, and basically you\xe2\x80\x99d just want everyone to report any suspicious behavior to the authorities for testing. As long as you contain the spread before it hits critical mass, which is like 50% of the population, you should be able to seek out and destroy any alien clones. It\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a rough year for sure, but the alien spores would eventually stop raining from the sky as there isn\xe2\x80\x99t an infinite amount of them. Sure, you could argue that you might not be able to make the connection between the mini ants and the alien bug, and it might not be realistic to jump to abducting someone at this point, so let\xe2\x80\x99s continue with the movie. They leave the house without Joey and continue to make more dumb decisions that waste precious time. Their ingenious plan is to take it to the police, and guess what, they burn their last bridge with the cop on the naive assumption that Kayla\xe2\x80\x99s dad wouldn't have moved the body after Zach suspiciously used the restroom. Things get really weird at the house when the mom shows up alive. I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure how that\xe2\x80\x99s possible. Maybe some super-fast healing shit like we saw with Mrs. Bissette. She was pretzeled into a towel bin for christ sake. You can\xe2\x80\x99t just unfold yourself. And they have Joey. It\xe2\x80\x99s a standoff with the three friends, a disbelieving cop, and the imposter family over custody of Joey. They eventually leave without Joey, again. * This is a huge mistake. Unless Joey\xe2\x80\x99s wearing some plot armor we don\xe2\x80\x99t know about yet, he\xe2\x80\x99s 100% fucked. Whatever\xe2\x80\x99s happening, it\xe2\x80\x99s happening fast. A simple bite and it\xe2\x80\x99s all over, and the pastor is known for possessing the rat insect thing. If he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t already bit, he will be soon. There is no reason they had to leave the house without him. Joey was literally screaming and crying to get away from her and to leave with Zach, Randy, and Kayla. No cop would just leave a kid in that situation, at least I hope not. The cell service and internet is still completely down at this point. They head back to the barn homebase, and find Zach\xe2\x80\x99s dad. His previously amputated legs are, well, restored to their non-amputated state. And, they are surrounded by the other townsfolk, yep, it\xe2\x80\x99s confirmed, the bug people are getting more aggressive now that they are reaching critical mass. The assimilated lock Zach and Randy in the barn with the insects, and Randy gets bit. * Dammit Randy, I told you to wear layers and bring weapons. There\xe2\x80\x99s some kind of alien black gestational sac with something inside it. It gives birth to Zach\xe2\x80\x99s naked mom. * Definitely not an image you can forget easily. Zach\xe2\x80\x99s naked mom runs over to, Zach\xe2\x80\x99s real mom i\xe2\x80\x99m guessing. The ant bugs are crawling from the alien mom to the real mom, seemingly sucking her soul out. Randy with the slick wits grabs a shovel and tries to bash the alien mom. The shovel breaks in half. Zach grabs the broken shovel and spears the alien mom with it. It seemed like that did the trick. * It\xe2\x80\x99s not super healing from a parasite controlling the original. Instead, a clone is created using the DNA obtained from the bug bite, then the clone attacks and sucks the life force out of the original, then replaces their identity. * War is declared at this point, there\xe2\x80\x99s no hiding now. It's guns free on any of these aliens now, as they are just clones of the dead original. By now, we have more than enough proof to continue with our plan I laid out earlier. Hopefully Randy's mom fared better. Well, I guess they didn't care or assumed she was dead, because they went to find Cam Shigawnday.. * Damn, Jake Tyler (*) beat this dude so badly he moved into a trailer in Shithole, Missouri. He\xe2\x80\x99s not throwing any sick parties at his new digs, that\xe2\x80\x99s for sure. Turns out, he was bitten too. Except that he shot his double in the head when it came after him. They have the idea to take the body to the FBI and shut this alien operation down. This guy\xe2\x80\x99s thinking what I'm thinking. Ironically, I'm pretty sure he\xe2\x80\x99s going to die. This also means Randy has a clone coming to kill him in a bit, sweet. Right on cue, Randy\xe2\x80\x99s double comes out of the forest and attacks them. Along with a hundred other alien imposters. * It seems like they are pretty fucked. * Yep, Josh gets pulled into the crowd of clones. Come on man, where are those MMA skills. Randy runs off, creating a diversion so Zach and Kayla can get away. * The clones seem pretty dumb. They easily could have taken out all 4 of them if they just split up instead of all running after Randy. Zach and Kayla make a hasty plan to rescue Joey, and grab a car to head to Springfield so they can get cell service and upload their video footage. They decide to head into town on foot to find the car and Joey. * Being on foot and going into town is a horrible idea. Joey is no doubt dead as fuck by now. I gotta believe there\xe2\x80\x99s a truck in some more remote farmhouse you can jack. Inevitably, while on foot in town they get caught. But holy shit was that some amazingly well-coordinated and lucky quick thinking by Zach and Kayla. * Apparently they can\xe2\x80\x99t detect if you\xe2\x80\x99re assimilated or not, nor will they check if you are. This was an incredibly risky strategy that just happened to work. This is not something I would have tried, as you\xe2\x80\x99d probably get killed. One wrong move and you\xe2\x80\x99re bug food. (OG Body Snatchers Yell) Holy shit, they\xe2\x80\x99re burning the corpses of the original people they cloned themselves from. Damn. They continue their charade to try to get the keys to the car. Kayla spots Joey from a distance, he\xe2\x80\x99s obviously a clone now, but Kayla turns into an idiot and goes after him. * Oh shit, he\xe2\x80\x99s not one of them, sorry Joey. If it were me instead of Kayla, you\xe2\x80\x99d be dead, hell I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have even gone back into the town to attempt to save you. Oh well. Kayla and Joey lock eyes, and they both let out a single tear. The other zombies catch the sense offenders in the act (Equilibrium), and mark them for processing (You mean execution). Joey\xe2\x80\x99s able to flee, but Kayla\xe2\x80\x99s about to get the bug bite. Zach crashes the party with the van and they both make a hot extraction. * Damn, I was hoping Zach would go grand theft auto and plow right through the alien rally. Kayla and Zach stop the car in the middle of the road to have a heart to heart discussion while Joey is still desperately trying to evade the aliens on foot. Since Kaylas bit, she starts talking like she\xe2\x80\x99s already dead. Brah, chill, you got bit, but you can still kill off the attacker. Zach keeps rambling instead of kissing her, and the bugs find them and bite Zach too, killing the mood. They run after the bug, this time it\xe2\x80\x99s not because it might have rabies, it\xe2\x80\x99s because if they catch it they can prevent the creation of a DNA copy of Zach, and a clone of him from attacking. * First off, couldn\xe2\x80\x99t you guys have had that discussion while driving, jesus. * Secondly, trying to run after the bug, on foot, in the woods, is super dumb. You won\xe2\x80\x99t catch it. * Being on foot in the woods is dangerous because you can't really hide. The mini bugs are everywhere and they could alert the aliens to your location. . * Considering it\xe2\x80\x99s running back to the clones, you\xe2\x80\x99re literally running towards the danger. * And what does it matter whether other clones or your clone come to kill you, the end result is the same. It\xe2\x80\x99s over, you\xe2\x80\x99re bit, just stay in the car and keep driving. While sneaking through the forest, they run into Randy. For a second, I thought it might be the OG Randy acting like a clone just as they did earlier. But nope, it\xe2\x80\x99s the clone. Kayla bashes it in the head with a stone and Zach drowns his best friend's alien twin. A traumatizing event, no doubt. They finally make it to the internet building, where they are attacked by the naked clones of themselves. (Brain drain piping) * Why did you drop the pipe, that\xe2\x80\x99s the best weapon you\xe2\x80\x99ve found so far. At the main trunk terminal, they upload their murder footage to Youtube, where it will be immediately censored. At least create an appealing title, nobody\xe2\x80\x99s going to find or click on Video # 598435. But then again, it's a new Youtube channel so good luck getting views anyways. * Instead, I\xe2\x80\x99d email the mp4 to the FBI, CIA, CDC, WHO, National Guard, etc. As well as make a quick post on Twitter and Facebook with a descriptive title so people actually click it. Using the video noise, they bait the clones into the room, and then use the c02 extinguishers to suffocate them, which is pretty darn clever. They make their escape and go to rescue Joey back at the cabin, if he\xe2\x80\x99s still alive. Once they get to the cabin, they walk right up onto the porch to check it out. * Instead of walking in like they did, which is super risky, I'd throw rocks at the windows in a distinct pattern. It\xe2\x80\x99s not something the clones would do, so Joey could probably realize it was us. Once he comes out, make bird noises or some shit and assess his reaction and movements. They peek into the windows and see Joey watching TV in the living room. * Why the fuck would you be watching cartoons in the living room in clear view from the windows. Earlier he was hiding in the attic because his dad was acting strange, now he\xe2\x80\x99s just chilling on the sofa when a full blown alien apocalypse is occurring. Nope. This is a trap. I\xe2\x80\x99m betting Pastor Greg is hanging out with this little boy too. * I guess I was wrong, Joey was just being an idiot. Man, if I was in the movie Joey would be super dead by now. We find out that he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t watching cartoons either, he was watching a webcam broadcast of the entire world being overrun by these things. The stark realization sets in that they weren\xe2\x80\x99t the first town to get hit, their podunk shithole was the last place to get hit, or more likely, everywhere was hit at the same time via the spores falling from the sky. * I don\xe2\x80\x99t get how the entire world was taken over without the people of Moulton realizing it, but whatever. The last scene is of their youtube video, it has zero views. Except a few comments from a handful of survivors around the world. * Surviving at this point is looking pretty bleak. It\xe2\x80\x99s down to Joey, Zach, and Kayla, and some rando\xe2\x80\x99s across the world who we can\xe2\x80\x99t communicate with. We could hide and evade the aliens for a while, but hunger would set in and we\xe2\x80\x99d need to act like clones to make food runs. This is super dangerous and we\xe2\x80\x99re likely to get caught eventually (Scream), so this method is out. However, there is a way to not starve. If you\xe2\x80\x99ve watched my other videos you might know where i\xe2\x80\x99m headed. The mini ant aliens seem to be everywhere, forming into bugs that can bite us in order to send clones to kill and replace us. There\xe2\x80\x99s nowhere we can really hide from them. Once the clone of you arrives, kill the clone, then butcher, cook and eat it. It\xe2\x80\x99s going to take a bit of mental effort to get used to the idea, since you\xe2\x80\x99re basically cannibalizing your own body. You gotta look for the silver living here, the aliens are basically delivering fresh food to your door, same day delivery. * Say we managed to make the correct decisions earlier on by taking Bissette to the hospital and finding out what\xe2\x80\x99s going on at the beginning, and salvaged most of the town. We\xe2\x80\x99d know that bite\xe2\x80\x99s are used to create clones that attack and replace us. We could form defenses, use buddy systems and weapons, implement testing procedures to identify clones, etc. But we\xe2\x80\x99re still fucked. The spores are constantly raining down all over the place, creating ants, which create the bugs, which bite us, which create clones which attack us. The townsfolk would constantly be under siege from attacking clones. * If nobody is producing food because we\xe2\x80\x99re constantly under attack, we\xe2\x80\x99d all starve. I sure as shit wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to be harvesting cornfields with naked alien zombies attacking me. Sure, we could eat the clones like we talked about earlier, but that\xe2\x80\x99s if everyone can kill them. * The clones didn\xe2\x80\x99t always attack at night, when Randy and Zach were attacked, they were in the barn during the day. This means the clone can be formed inside the prey's home, in the attic, then the clone can come down and kill them when they are asleep. Eventually the survivors would be whittled down. * In the TV broadcast, the clones seemed to act like wwz zombies when no prey was around, just dormant. That said, we did see them packing up bugs into trucks for transport. Like the ants, it\xe2\x80\x99s reasonable to assume they communicate with each other, and even if we regained a survivor foothold in Moulton, the aliens would signal to surrounding towns to attack Moulton. We\xe2\x80\x99d be outnumbered and killed. * I think the only way you could really survive is by grabbing some horses and staying on the move like one of the cannibalistic indian tribes back in the day. It\xe2\x80\x99ll be hard for the aliens to hide a gestating alien egg on the open plains or in our Teepees. You could keep the imposter hordes at a distance, only allowing the bugs to bite you and your clone to run after you. Or picking off stray clones that wander too far from the group and bringing them back to camp for a delicious feast (*Hannibel Lecter). I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how healthy it would be, but they are DNA-matching clones, and meat is meat, right. Or, you could hunt wild animals like a normal person. Now that I think of it, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why I suggested cannibalism first. Maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s because it\xe2\x80\x99s easier than hunting, as they come to you. * I think the chances of surviving and beating the body snatchers in assimilation are slim, considering the whole world is taken over by the time we realize what\xe2\x80\x99s going on. But... How would you beat them? Let me know in the comments. Thanks for watching. And remember, they\xe2\x80\x99re here already, and you\xe2\x80\x99re next! (*)
