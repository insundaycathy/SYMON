what's the problem? if i don't win, i'm out. nobody wants the second fastest man in the seven what the hell is compound v? sounds like some kind of performance enhancer. if we get a bit can you work out? well, i can run some tests, of course, but there's no way of knowing unless i try so myself. annie huey from the bench the other day, how the hell do you know starlight? i don't really know her nowhere. you get a number? uh, yeah, got it. good. hey, train. how are you celebrating tonight? uh, well, you know me, i'm always in the game, but i'm too fast to catch [ __ ] hell, you said it. you're a smart lad, but you still ain't tweaked to the one weakness. they all got, their reputations. we're gonna help you sort out this little mess. and all you've got to do is tell us everything you know about this. a [ __ ] porpoise found this at the bottom of the harbor. is that translucent? i still think we got nothing to worry about, whoever it was they just declared war? god damn it. frenchie, oh my god. v so a train's running an ear, and these blokes are those in the asian bird were there? we're sniffing down a ship's sandwich a size of watergate. vort and the soups are both going to be looking for her. all we got to do is find the female first. what'd you do? what the hell are you talking about? who did you tell about compound b i didn't tell anyone. starlight, yeah, it's nothing. i mean, we were supposed to go on a date. call about right now. you're [ __ ] going, you're gonna hotmark her phone from now on. we hear everything she says. it's all safe. you're all gonna be fine. captain, there you go. just relax. hey, think we're done here? oh, sweetheart, of course. i'm gonna save you. you betcha she ain't no spice girl. we arrived three minutes after the plane went down. why? because we're not in the chain of command. if they let us into the military, then this will never happen again. that is my solemn promise to you. together, we will make sure that this never happens to our great nation ever again. fifteen thousand dollars for an exclusive vip experience with the z-cam? seriously? well, starlight's one of the headliners, right? she'll get you in. what's the matter? are you worried your fake suit girlfriend's gonna think you're using her? this is from that club you took me to you remembered our first night together untouched. so who the hell is he? huh? something running down on our own. oh, baby, you're starlight of the seven. millions of kids are looking up to you now. is there any way you could hook me up with one of those diamond club passes, you know, to see ezekiel? what do you want? you want a little bit of money? are you here for money? you ship boxes label this polio vaccine, but they're not really polio vaccine, are they? they're compound v you tell me where they're going. can you tell me how many boxes you ship? i can't do that. you want to know why? because i believe that what god wants me to do is find the filthy bastards that masterminded this, whatever came their own and introduced it to a little thing called god's judgment? anyone who tells you they know the answers is lying. and i know, i know, i'm supposed to be this hero, idol, symbol, whatever, but i don't know what the hell i'm doing. i'm done pretending, and i'm done taking any more [ __ ], oh my god, jesus, that's a [ __ ] baby soup chosen. but got my ass these [ __ ] are made in a [ __ ] lab that that was a great speech. i'm so glad. how was your quality time with ezekiel? huh? any more vip tickets or a goodie bag? my girlfriend died. what happened not too long ago. and i came here looking for a way to get out of the [ __ ] that i'm in right now. i mean, you're right, there's nobody knows. and that's the only [ __ ] thing i've heard all day that's makes any sense at all. why don't you cut the petulant diva [ __ ], show a little [ __ ] gratitude and let us do our job? no, i'm sorry. no red carpets, no reality tv and no noxsema commercials. and i think that firing an employee after she reported sexual assault on live tv might tank your stock price i'm gonna need you to make a public apology, and you're going to be taking a sabbatical from the seven. my wife, becca used to hunt the spice girls, show me around. [ __ ], ben, you know, she was happy. homelander, right there. that was eight years ago. either homeland that killed her, or she killed herself, same difference. will you just [ __ ] keep her under control? wait, why would vac give compound v to terrorists? because the only thing more dangerous than the terrorists is a soup terrorist. and the only way to fight it is with sergeant [ __ ]. homelander, i can give you everything you want on this list, except except. homelander, you're [ __ ] scared. i'm [ __ ] terrified, and you should be too. a train said that you have some information. do you have something for me or not? yeah, he said you were looking for a, uh, skinny white guy, british guy. got to keep your eye on the ball, guys. the enemies are storming the gates. i mean, we're not even the seventh anymore. we're down to fives. but at least now i know why. this guy is hugh campbell. he's also one of the guys who killed translucent. wait, what? i know this guy. you did smash through his girlfriend, so i should hope. so say hi to baby boy. dad. oh, hey. hey, hey. why is he here? he says, you're in some kind of trouble. dad, are you okay? get your ass over here. in 20 minutes, i'm gonna burst on like a [ __ ] pinata. do you understand me? just like i did, your girlfriend that accident had a name. and what about popclaw? she had a name too. you put her in danger, and then you threw her out like she was [ __ ] garbage. you know, you're right. it would have been stupid to come along. eight years ago, rebecca butcher had come to her with a completely unprecedented medical condition. she was pregnant with your child. we told her we'd deliver the baby safely in a secure location. and the baby lived all of 10 seconds, drowned in its mother's blood. no homeland, though, no homelander. we had a deal. everyone else is fair game. do you want this or not? watch this. hey, freeze [ __ ] dude. how is that son of a [ __ ] still alive? the keep means captain. we believe it's his soup name. are you telling me they have a suit terrorist? if you bring me in, i'm dead before sunrise. no, vault will want to string you up for a long trial. this is about compound v. it's this drug. it gives the soups their powers. pentagon's agreed to keep compound v classified, classified in the doj agreed. you're wanting men. now, how old was i when you let vat pump me full of drugs? annie, honestly, i don't know how old when you let them turn me into a free you have a good life. people would give anything to be what you are. madeline, stillwell, what's vp? homelanders remain account they have a, what shall we say, a very special relationship. i don't know if homelander has a weakness, but if he does, she'll know it. vod is giving compound b to some bad [ __ ] people, like really bad, like that soup terrace. that's insane. no, it's true. look, my friends want to stop it, but they got caught on vat's orders. and i huey, i was almost arrested. and now you want me to help your psycho killer friends. i really did break every bone in my right arm. i was just like you. and then i started giving pieces of myself away, and i guess i gave away everything. so you know what? be just be original. be the annoying goody two shoes [ __ ] that you are. did it ever occur to you that a suit terror is showing up exactly when we needed him to? was pretty [ __ ] incredible coincidence? well, i borrowed some compound v and now we have villains all over the globe that only we can fight. i know you can see through the ceiling. you try to kill me and my trigger finger goes soft. what do you want? do you want a confession? or are you telling me that this whole thing is based on [ __ ] feelings? you came like you said, i'm a [ __ ] superhero. homelander, is right. you are a [ __ ] rat. turn around and walk away. i i think he's having a heart attack. tell me the truth, or i walk out right now. i'm scared of you. thank you. what was that plan again? oh, well, mom, wow. look at this handsome devil. hey, pal. you know who i am? homelander, yeah, mommy didn't tell you. i'm your father. we are a family
