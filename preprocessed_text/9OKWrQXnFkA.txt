If you were transported into the beginning of A Quiet Place\xe2\x80\x99s alien invasion, with nothing but your lack of survival skills, your empty supplies cabinet, and the leftover food in your fridge, could you not just survive, but fight back and win? Intro (Background of Topic + What they\xe2\x80\x99ll learn / Open Loop) In this video on Nerd Explains, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you: How to Kill, The Monsters from A Quiet Place. Know Thy Enemy What\xe2\x80\x99s the skinny on these monsters? I\xe2\x80\x99ve read the wiki, but some of that\xe2\x80\x99s a bit bullshit. They are aliens that hitched a ride on an asteroid that landed on Earth. The most important piece of intel is that they are blind-ish, and hunt by sound primarily. Though their hearing is obscenely good, they seem to get confused by sounds easily. They can\xe2\x80\x99t see, but they can use echolocation to maneuver their environment and locate prey. In the movie it\xe2\x80\x99s a really rough form of echolocation, as they can\xe2\x80\x99t see very well, but in real life if they had the echolocation abilities of a bat, they could see you walking around outside and murder you. They have armor that is supposedly impenetrable, but that\xe2\x80\x99s most likely just for small arms fire. They can seemingly survive the vacuum of space and don\xe2\x80\x99t need oxygen. We never see the monsters feed, but they have to sustain themselves so let's assume they do eat off screen, they have teeth and a mouth afterall. Oh, and they have superhuman speed, strength, and sharp claws that can rip through armor. What happened to our military? A lot of people wonder why the military failed to kill these monsters. These things came down on an asteroid, most likely more than one. Which means they probably landed all over the world, in lots of cities for all we know. With the speed, durability, and stealth of these monsters, they could spread all over cities in short order. Guerilla warfare is historically super effective. This means we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be able to fight them on a front, nor would we be able to create supply lines. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to get choppers off the ground when these creatures could shred them on the landing pad, and even if we could, they\xe2\x80\x99d be hard to detect, and most likely would be close proximity to innocent civilians. Can\xe2\x80\x99t exactly drop a hellfire missile into the local Target parking lot or open up the 20mm cannon on the monsters while they are shredding wage slaves that are stuck in rush hour traffic. We don\xe2\x80\x99t know how many of these things there are, and with how quickly they attacked we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be able to organize a defense strategy factoring in their potential weaknesses.They might hide from extremely loud noises (say, tanks or massed groups of soldiers) and attack only in isolated pockets or slip past them to get to civilian populations. Even if the military killed a ton, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t enough. But what if we guerilla warfare them back like we did with the British? Well the british wore red uniforms for camouflage and walked down city streets singing and pounding on drums in formation whilst being picked off by farmers like Mel Gibson. These are ninja space aliens that might even pose a challenge to Riddick, just kidding, Vin Diesel would trash them with a sick one-liner. That only really works if you\xe2\x80\x99re the minority and can hide amongst the populations. So our military is defeated, pockets of resistance are all that\xe2\x80\x99s left. You are now solely responsible for your own survival. What precautions do we need to take when hunting these monsters? The first rule of a quiet place is to not talk about a quiet place. All the standard library rules apply. The second rule is to not get pregnant or have kids. If you already broke the second rule, fear not, you can sacrifice them as bait or diversions before they get you killed by playing with the Turboman they found in a store while you were trying to find supplies so you could put food on the fucking table so you all didn\xe2\x80\x99t die. Third rule is to always have a pocket full of lures, fireworks, rocks if you get snapped up. Luckily the monsters have a low IQ and if they are inches from killing you and they hear a kid pop a bottle rocket off in the distance they will completely forget about you. Getting the Tools of the Trade If you spread the map on the table, we can pin some important locations for supplies we\xe2\x80\x99ll need. Grocery stores, gas stations, hardware stores, industrial equipment, national guard armories, police station armories, etc. Here\xe2\x80\x99s a protip, don\xe2\x80\x99t worry about getting food or supplies when shit is going down. Lay low for a month or so, your fat stores will sustain you for a while. Most people don\xe2\x80\x99t watch videos like this, they suck, they panic, they will get killed. Once your neighbors all got themselves killed, you can raid their houses. Since these aliens don\xe2\x80\x99t eat everything they kill, there should be plenty of dead wildlife around to throw on the grill as well, or human meat if that\xe2\x80\x99s what you\xe2\x80\x99re into. If you kill one of the creatures you could eat their meat as well, though they look a bit emaciated, but who knows, there\xe2\x80\x99s probably a lot of lean protein under that exoskeleton. So the military is defeated, your neighbors are all dead, things have gotten really quiet. You generally know what the alien\xe2\x80\x99s weaknesses are, and supplies are bountiful around town. It\xe2\x80\x99s time to put monster meat back on the menu.

Firearms We gotta acquire some military firearms. Before you say oh nerd explains but those make sounds and where are you gonna get them this is a tiny IQ move, hold up. These monsters might be resistant to AR15\xe2\x80\x99s, marksman rifles, and even Ma Deuce 50 cal machine guns when in turtle mode. But an AT4 84-mm unguided, portable, single-shot recoilless smoothbore weapon firing high explosive anti tank projectiles with 16.5 inches of armor penetration via a high velocity jet stream of molten liquid metal that is traveling at ~25k miles an hour. \xe2\x80\x9cBut their armor is impenetrable\xe2\x80\x9d, as Bronn in GOT said it, give me a clear line of sight and an AT4, and i\xe2\x80\x99ll penetrate the bitch, something like that. As to where to get it, Idk do national guard armories have AT4\xe2\x80\x99s? If they do, then pop on a paramotor and fly over to it. Yah, a paramotor, one of the best most versatile methods of transportation in the apocalypse. It\xe2\x80\x99s a bit noisy to start up, but you can be in the air in seconds, and you can turn the motor off before landing quietly. I could go on about the paramotor but trust me. I wonder if you could fire a rocket launcher from a paramotor. Hmm. Rocket launchers aside, they have a critical weakness to any small arms a civilian could obtain, and no it\xe2\x80\x99s not a fucking hearing aid. See, these monsters stay turtled when they hear loud noises, but when they get close and their prey gets quiet, they drop their shield exoskeleton so that they can tune in and listen more closely. That\xe2\x80\x99s when you hit them with the pump, right in the ear hole. The hearing aid high frequency thing isn\xe2\x80\x99t necessary, but it\xe2\x80\x99s helpful. I\xe2\x80\x99m kinda mad Sergeant Rita Vrataski and Jack Ryan couldn\xe2\x80\x99t figure this out earlier. Since these monsters attack individually and not like a pack of wolves, this makes things easier. Yes they are fast, but realistically you could use cameras to find isolated monsters. Place a radio or baby monitor if you broke the second rule, in the middle of a field, with a remote control raise the volume until an isolated monster hears it, then lower the volume until it\xe2\x80\x99s barely audible one they are close. When they get super close, turn the radio off. This will draw the monster close, then make them open their armor so they can listen more closely to try to find what they think is hiding prey. The last thing they will hear is the click of the trigger break before a .338 Lapua enters their cranium and, since they\xe2\x80\x99re armored, that bullet will ping pong around their insides turning their guts to soup. If you broke the second rule we talked about earlier, and your girl is pregnant or you have a newborn, maybe you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be popping off rocket propelled grenades and ripping off belt-feds. Or maybe you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to draw every nearby monster to your position. What else can we use? Poison Dart Air Guns. Super quiet, use a similar formula as above, except you\xe2\x80\x99re going to need to get close. The CIA used these as heart attack guns I guess, it\xe2\x80\x99s not relevant, just thought that was interesting. As far as what poison to use, honestly just dip the dart in human shit. It\xe2\x80\x99s not like the monsters have healthcare insurance and hospitals. A shot into their exposed face would cause a nasty infection that they can\xe2\x80\x99t treat. Same shit for bow and arrows. These are accessible at your local sporting goods store just like airguns, and are quiet methods of creature killing. Since the monster you\xe2\x80\x99re attacking will no doubt hear the bow launching the arrow, you still only have 1 shot to get it right just like with firearms. The benefit to bows is that you don\xe2\x80\x99t attract every monster in a 3 mile radius. Throwing Knives. Again, you need to lure them in close, then stay quiet, they will open their armor in an attempt to tune in and hear you, that\xe2\x80\x99s when you stick em. Okay this is mainly for showoffs going for the kill of the year. It\xe2\x80\x99s obscenely dangerous as you need to be within 7 yards unless you\xe2\x80\x99re jason statham. It\xe2\x80\x99s unique in that it really makes no sound at all to throw a knife. They couldn\xe2\x80\x99t really pinpoint where it was thrown from. If you miss, they will attack the noise where the knife landed instead of you. This is definitely for experts only. Ewok Logs. If you can silently cut two trees down, string them up, lure the monster in between the two tree logs, you can do the monsters like the ewoks did that at-st\xe2\x80\x99s. Just don\xe2\x80\x99t also use slingshots with rocks like they did, that\xe2\x80\x99s just suicide. Explosives We already discussed how an AT4 will splatter these space aliens. But C4 is also another tool. But not in the way you might think. The monster when turtled could potentially survive a close proximity blast, but given that the monsters are always using their ears to hunt you, this presents another weakness we can exploit. Projectile weapons won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to get through the tiny cracks in their armor, but air can. Yes, air. The overpressure caused by an explosive blast will rupture any soft tissues. The ears are the first organs to feel the change in pressure. That's what they're designed for, after all. Ears are meant to allow people to sense minute changes in air pressure - sound - over short amounts of time. As such, they're extremely sensitive to pressure, especially with these monsters. A wave of pressure that lasts less than .3 milliseconds leaves the eardrum no time to adjust to changes in pressure, and simply tears it. Basically, the monster might survive the blast, but their primary sensing organ for hunting you, gets obliterated. Now that they are deaf, they can be killed much more easily. As far as how to get C4 that close to them. Baiting is easy. Burt Gummer pioneered the RC car bomb in Tremors. Napalm. I know that the monsters are heat resistant and don\xe2\x80\x99t need oxygen for survival, but it\xe2\x80\x99s just easy to make and worth a shot, all you need is gasoline and packing peanuts. String up a bucket of homemade napalm above a door home alone style. Once the monster comes through the door, a wire gets tripped, napalm gets dumped on the monster, and a secondary torch gets lit. It\xe2\x80\x99s a macaulay culkin classic with a bit more of an edge to it. If the monster's ears are perked up as it walks through the door and the lit napalm gets under the armor, it could do some damage. To kick it up a notch, you can add homemade thermite to the mix, 4000 degree liquid metal getting poured all over you would certainly fuck up it\xe2\x80\x99s day at the very least. Electricity Biological organisms and electricity don\xe2\x80\x99t bode well when combined. Just ask Marv from home alone. Since these monsters like to swim, once they take a dip in a body of water, throw in the toaster or clothing iron. Or you could go high tech and fire up a generator that\xe2\x80\x99s hooked up to surrounding electrified fences. Once they try to get through the fence to attack the noisy generator, they\xe2\x80\x99ll get a taste of that lightning. Industrial Equipment Rock crushers and wood chippers. If you\xe2\x80\x99re creative enough to find a way to get one of these monsters into the mouth of a rock crusher, it\xe2\x80\x99s game over. Those jaws are insanely powerful and even if one of these monsters takes a swing at it out of frustration at the noise, if that limb gets caught in the jaws or the chipper, mm. Something about killing space aliens by repurposing industrial equipment. The Environment Zombieland 2 had a great scene where they funneled the zombies onto the rooftop of a tall building, then Tallahassee leapt off the edge and grabbed a crane hook that dangled past the edge. All the zombies jumped after him, falling to their deaths. These monsters don\xe2\x80\x99t seem too smart, and it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem like their echolocation is that accurate, so this is probably worth a shot. See, this is why you watch movies, so when the apocalypse hits you have all these strategies in mind. Instructions are the same if you live near a volcano or cliff. In conclusion, I think with a little ingenuity, some elbow grease, and a pile of plastic explosives we could end this threat before we gave up like those pussies John and Emily. How would you kill the monsters in A Quiet Place? Do you agree with my selections, why or why not? Let me know in the comments. And while you\xe2\x80\x99re at it, let me know what other movies or games you want me to cover like this. Thanks for watching, later.
