Hi, Mystery Recapped here. Today, I'm going to explain the mystery thriller film called \xe2\x80\x9cJulia\xe2\x80\x99s eyes.\xe2\x80\x9d Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care! The movie starts when we see a blind woman...named Sara talking to an invisible presence. The presence has been tormenting her for days. It plays songs and follows her around the house. Sara cannot take more of this...so she goes to the basement to hang herself. Just then, she feels the presence near her. She changes her mind...but before she can remove the noose, someone kicks the tool away. A person from a corner...clicks a picture of her hanging to death. A set of hospital tools lies on a table nearby. Sara\xe2\x80\x99s twin sister Julia lives miles away from her. As Sara hangs to death, Julia collapses. She senses something wrong, and decides to visit Sara. Julia and her husband, Issac, come looking for Sara and find her dead in the basement. Sara and Julia both had the same kind of disease that made their vision progressively worse...eventually making them blind, but Sara\xe2\x80\x99s vision had gotten bad before Julia\xe2\x80\x99s. At home, the police officer suggests...declaring it a case of suicide\xe2\x80\xa6he suspects Sara got depressed with her blindness, so she committed suicide. However, Julia insists.. it is not, as Sara was waiting for a donor to get her vision back She believes this is not a case of suicide, but that of murder. He then informs her of a blind lady named Soledad...who Sara used to talk to. Julia visits Soledad, and gets to know about a place named Baumann Centre; a place for handicapped people. She tells her that Sara had made new friends there. Julia visits the place. When she goes there, she hears a group of blind women gossiping about Sara. Sara had a boyfriend who she went with\xe2\x80\xa6 to a hotel in Bellavista. The women notice Julia\xe2\x80\x99s presence and confront her. When she introduces herself, they ask who the man she came with is. Julia is surprised because she had come alone. But the women sense someone standing right behind her. Julia sees someone walk out. She chases the person, and reaches a small dark room. The person is right in front of her, but she cannot see him due to the darkness. He flashes his camera which distracts Julia, and he escapes. Her eyesight goes weak. Issac wants her to go back home...because any more stress will cause Julia to lose her vision ,but she convinces him to go to Bellavista for a holiday. In reality, she wants to find out Sara\xe2\x80\x99s boyfriend whom the blind women had been talking about As they arrive in Bellasvista, she chooses the hotel in which Sara stayed with her boyfriend. In the hotel, she cannot find any record of Sara's boyfriend. Later at lunch, a waitress tells her that her twin, Sara, already had her eye operation. So she is confused as why Sara committed suicide if she already had the operation. Then, Issac reveals...that Sara\xe2\x80\x99s doctor told him that her eye operation was not successful. According to him, this is the reason Sara committed suicide. As Julia is about to leave the hotel, a janitor named Cr\xc3\xa9spulo says that he found something in Sara\xe2\x80\x99s hotel room. He guides her to Sara\xe2\x80\x99s room, and gives her a key that belonged to Sara. Cr\xc3\xa9spulo also tells her to be careful of the man in the dark. Just then, Julia senses someone behind her. The person runs away before she can catch him. Julia and Issac then go to get surveillance camera footage to identify the person Sara was with. Issac goes in to get the footage, but never comes back. When Julia goes in to check, Issac is not there; all the footages are gone too. She reports to the police about Issac\xe2\x80\x99s disappearance ,and tells them about the invisible man. Just then, we see Cr\xc3\xa9spulo bathing in a tub. Someone cuts off the light bulb over him. It electrocutes him to death. The police and Julia come looking for Cr\xc3\xa9spulo, and find him dead. Julia is now sure that the invisible man has killed Cr\xc3\xa9spulo and kidnapped her husband. Worried about Issac, she gets a seizure that further weakens her eyesight. She goes to see her doctor... who tells her that she has less than a month before she goes fully blind. He arranges an eye transplant surgery for her. Later that day, she goes back to Soledad\xe2\x80\x99s house. Soledad had a husband and a son named \xc3\x81ngel. Her husband left her, and \xc3\x81ngel had looked after her for ten years before suddenly leaving one day Shortly, the police find Issac\xe2\x80\x99s last location to be a motel. They also find his wedding ring in the room he stayed in. As the Inspector and Julia are in the motel talking, another officer comes saying that someone is at Julia\xe2\x80\x99s home. The two of them return back. Inspector goes to check into a room...when Julia hears a noise from the basement. She goes down to check\xe2\x80\xa6but because of her eyesight and the room\xe2\x80\x99s darkness, she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t see anything. She feels around the room and suddenly touches a man. Scared, she starts to yell for help. The inspector comes down, and tries to calm her; suddenly, the lights come back. Issac\xe2\x80\x99s body hangs from the ceiling. He has committed suicide. But even when the lights are on, Julia can\xe2\x80\x99t see. She has gone fully blind. The following day at the hospital, the inspector tells Julia about Issac\xe2\x80\x99s suicide letter. He had an affair with Sara for six months before her death. He killed himself because he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t lie to Julia anymore. A few days later, Julia goes through eye surgery. She has to live with the bandage around her eyes for a week. Only after that, will we know if the surgery has been successful. During this time, she will stay under supervision in her twin\xe2\x80\x99s house. The hospital provides Julia with a caretaker named Ivan...to help her around the house. He gives her a device to hang around her neck...so that she can call him anytime she wants. That night, Julia gets a nightmare about Issac and Sara trying to get her bandage off. She wakes up terrified. Then she hears footsteps from outside. She calls Ivan through the device. He tells her to get out of the house. She escapes. Just then, someone takes the key Cr\xc3\xa9spulo had given her. The police come in the following day...but they do not find any evidence of invasion. Ivan lovingly changes Julia\xe2\x80\x99s bandage. For the next few days, he takes great care of her. Changing her bandages, cooking for her, listening to music with her, and whatnot. But throughout all those times, we never get to see Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s face. On the third day, Julia asks him to stay for drinks. They have a conversation about Issac...after which she kisses him. That night, Julia is woken up by a nightmare. As she reaches for her wedding ring on the side table, we see a set of hospital tools similar to one from the night of Sara\xe2\x80\x99s death... Someone from behind her tries to injects her with a drug. This wakes her up, and she finally touches the man. Terrified, she runs out of the house to her neighbor, Blasco\xe2\x80\x99s home. His daughter Lia is home too. He lets her inside but starts to harass Julia. Shortly, she is surprised to find Sara\xe2\x80\x99s key in his house; she takes it with her. She escapes from his house, and hides in a corner calling Ivan for help. Finally, Ivan comes to save her. She is too scared to go into her own house, so he takes her to his. There she tells him that she found Sarah's key at Mr. Blasco\xe2\x80\x99s home. She suspects that Blasco is the invisible man. Ivan leaves for some time when Lia approaches Julia. She has followed them here and snuck into the house through the windows. Lia tells Julia that she was the one who stole the key from her house and that she knows who killed Sara and Issac. It is the invisible man - IVAN himself Lia reveals that she used to be close to Sara; and knows a lot about the invisible man Julia doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe it but Lia insists that the key unlocks one of the locks in Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s house Ivan has been drugging Julia to make her go blind...as he did with Sara. Lia tells Julia to go to the bathroom, and stay there until Lia finds a way to escape. When Ivan comes back, she asks him to take her to the bathroom. She then opens her bandage\xe2\x80\xa64 days before the schedule. Luckily, the operation is successful, and she is happy to have gained her vision back. She quickly goes outside, and enters one of the rooms. She is shocked to see many pictures of Sara and herself on the wall. Julia leaves the room to look for Lia, but sees her body stabbed to the wall. Ivan had killed her too. Terrified, she sits down in the corner crying. Just then, Ivan comes into the room. We see his face for the first time. It is splattered with Lia\xe2\x80\x99s blood. Julia poses as though the surgery was unsuccessful, and pretends that she is still blind. Ivan expresses his love for her. Now she is in the kitchen with him. She sees him drugging her cup of tea. Julia then replaces her cup of tea with his. Ivan doesn\xe2\x80\x99t notice but he gets suspicious. He takes her to the freezer, and asks her to open it. Inside it... is the dead body of real Ivan. Julia gasps, giving away that she can actually see. The imposter Ivan calls her a liar. He then takes her to Sara\xe2\x80\x99s house, but Julia manages to run away from him into Soledad\xe2\x80\x99s house There she asks her to call the police, but Ivan comes in before she can. He calls Soledad \xe2\x80\x9cmom\xe2\x80\x9d...revealing that he is actually her son, \xc3\x81ngel. Julia pleads with Soledad to call the police, but \xc3\x81ngel convinces her that he is not a killer Then Soledad hits Julia on her head with the phone. \xc3\x81ngel realizes that his mother can see. Soledad reminds him he will be nothing without her. This agitates \xc3\x81ngel, so he chokes her. He wants her to go back to being blind again. He pokes her eyes with a needle. When Julia wakes up, she is in the basement of Sara\xe2\x80\x99s house. \xc3\x81ngel sits in front of her. He has packed all her clothes and plans to take her away to live with him. As he starts to kiss her, Julia takes a knife and stabs him on his legs. She quickly runs out of the basement and locks him there. But she can\xe2\x80\x99t get out of the house. She calls the police. Just as \xc3\x81ngel breaks the door, Julia cuts off all the lights in the house. It is pitch dark. Angel uses his camera flash to look for Julia, and finds her. As he tries to stab her, the police come in. But they too cannot see anyone in the dark room. Julia takes one of the torch lights from them, and shines it to \xc3\x81ngel in the corner. The shadow finally comes to light. \xc3\x81ngel cannot handle being looked at by so many people, so he slits his throat, killing himself Cut to a few weeks later, Julia is at the hospital, she finds that the damage to her new eyes is irreversible...as she had been continuously injected by her "fake" caretaker. Using her last few hours of vision, Julia says goodbye to Isaac's corpse. It is revealed that he was the one who donated her with his eyes. The movie ends as the camera zooms into Julia\xe2\x80\x99s eye... Now, for the explanation. Sara and Julia both have a condition called degenerative vision. This causes them to lose their vision progressively....eventually, going blind. Sara loses her vision before Julia. \xc3\x81ngel has a fascination for blind girls. He calls himself an invisible man. This is a metaphor for him trying to say that he has no friends or family. No one notices him when he\xe2\x80\x99s around because he\xe2\x80\x99s not worth noticing. Over time, \xc3\x81ngel has developed the ability to be stealthy, and stalk victims efficiently. He took care of his mother Soledad for ten years thinking she was blind. Soledad was the only person who he talked to. This filled \xc3\x81ngel with resentment towards everyone who did not notice or care for him. However, he fell in love with Sara, and then Julia. According to him, only blind girls could feel his presence. Sara tells her other blind friends at a Centre For The Blind that she\xe2\x80\x99s been dating someone. This person is \xc3\x81ngel. Once she has her eyes operated, she goes with \xc3\x81ngel to a Hotel in Bellavista for a week. At this point she has her eyes bandaged. We are not told what circumstances she meets with \xc3\x81ngel. Perhaps he was posing as her caretaker, and his empathy was winning Sara over. \xc3\x81ngel doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want Sara getting her eyesight back. He ensures that he sneaks up on Sara in the nights and injects her eyes with chemicals that destroy the optic nerve. The doctor declares that the operation has failed. Sara gets to know that someone is following her; she could feel his presence and resented him So, he killed her. When Julia came looking for Sara, \xc3\x81ngel saw it as another opportunity at love. But Julia had her husband always by her side. Hence, \xc3\x81ngel killed him as well. However, the neighbor girl, Lia, helped Julia find out about \xc3\x81ngel\xe2\x80\x99s real intentions before he could blind Julia fully. At the end, finally, Julia makes him visible to everyone. He had always been a lonely man. So, when the police officers had their eyes on him, he could not handle it, killing himself at the end.
