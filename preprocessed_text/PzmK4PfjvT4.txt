Years ago, back when the main protagonist, Charlotte, was around 13-14 years old she had joined the Bachoff Academy where she practiced and learned the cello. However, during her time there, she was drilled hard in her practice, she was verbally abused repeatedly for any mistakes and brainwashed into being the \xe2\x80\x98perfect\xe2\x80\x99 cellist, and what more was sexually abused, again and again by her teachers especially by Anton, her mentor. However she manages to escape, having to tend to her sick mother who after ten years, dies and Charlotte suffers a nervous breakdown before getting hospitalized after which she finds it within herself to take revenge against Bachoff Academy and more importantly try to open the eyes of Elizabeth, a fellow student of Bachoff who she has matching tattoos with, to make her realize that she\xe2\x80\x99s only special so long as she\xe2\x80\x99s useful to Anton. Charlotte heads to Shanghai to link up with Elizabeth and creates a clever plan that involves dosing her with the drugs her mother took which can cause hallucinations if alcohol is taken with the drugs. Stealing a meat cleaver from a restaurant before planting suggestions and gaslighting Elizabeth, she gives Liz the cleaver so that she can cut off her hand. After which, Charlotte reveals that she was also raped by Anton and that she made Liz chop of her hand to make her useless to Him. To ensure that Liz can never be abused by him ever again. Which is proven when Liz goes back to Boston, 3 weeks later and is kicked out from Bachoff Academy and although furious, she has finally accepted that she was abused and manipulated by Anton and works together with Charlotte to take Bachoff down: taking Charlotte back to Bachoff Academy where she is forced to play the \xe2\x80\x9cPerfection\xe2\x80\x9d, a ritual that involves the perfect performance of a difficult solo piece that every single special student of Bachoff must play in order to be \xe2\x80\x98the best\xe2\x80\x99, or as Anton puts it \xe2\x80\x98to be close to God\xe2\x80\x99. A ritual first started by Anton\xe2\x80\x99s grand father so many years ago, and the punishment for not being the best is to be raped by each teacher of Bachoff Academy. Meaning that Anton and all of the other teachers were abused previously having gone through the EXACT, SAME RITUAL Ultimately, with a few poisoned glasses of alcohol, and a knife to the back, Liz and Charlotte kill the teachers one by one until they finally get to Anton who after a brutal and bloody fight has his arms and legs amputated and is forced to listen to a performance of Liz and Charlotte\xe2\x80\x99s own version of the Perfection, working together to play in front of their abuser Now, something that I noticed throughout the film is the presence of circles or circular shapes and objects within shots. Some of the more striking and eye catching examples I found were the Peking Opera actor in the Shanghai Opera House who forms a circular shape with her hands, as well as the horns of the bus that Liz and Charlotte ride on, and the Bachoff Academy\xe2\x80\x99s chapel which has a very conspicuous architectural feature of a ring that is later revealed to be able to open up, serving as a backlight for all performers of the Perfection. Now the circles themselves represent a great deal of things in my opinion: for one they are an allusion to the Perfection, the namesake of the film, in which a performer is abused in a cult like practice and is said to be as perfect as God once they perform it correctly, it\xe2\x80\x99s also a symmetrical shape that retains an even, and perfect form that is not broken by corners and of course it\xe2\x80\x99s a circle. A continuous wheel, representing the endless cycle of abuse that Bachoff Academy condones which is finally broken by broken people. Early in the film, Liz chops off her right hand, and in the fight with Anton, Charlotte herself gets stabbed in the left arm, making them both symmetrical and opposite pieces who complete each other. Which is why at the end of film they wear black and white with Charlotte drawing the bow with her right hand and Liz modulating the pitch with her left. Allowing them to achieve perfection in their completeness and it is also why the letter \xe2\x80\x9cE\xe2\x80\x9d in the title card rotates to face the F in both the beginning and the end of the film: Because the E completes the F making them symmetrical and in turn making them perfect. With that being said, thank you so much for watching ladies and gentlemen.
