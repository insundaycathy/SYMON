Welcome to Cinema Summary, ladies and gentlemen grab your holy water, your pistol and whatever other monster slaying goodness you've got because we're going monster hunting with the Allen family. Based off of the comic series of the same name, the October Faction TV show takes a lot of liberties with the source material to add in elements that were not present in the original comic book which I will be referencing some times throughout this video and word of warning spoilers ahead and with that said this is October Faction Season 1 explained so the October Faction is all about the Allen family returning to Barrington, New York after Samuel Allen, the patriarch of the family dies under mysterious circumstances: Fred, Dolores, Vivian, and Geoff Allen move into the estate into a quiet little town that Vivian and Jeff just don't fit into which isn't helped by the fact that Vivian is a socially awkward and solitary artist and Jeff is a fun-loving homosexual who's 'kind' isn't too welcome in Barrington but we quite quickly learned that things are not as they seem as Vivian has a vision of some very strange and bizarre events though after Vivian tries to do a seance to try and connect to the spirit of her dead grandpa she instead connects to a woman who she sees chained beneath the water in a vision and accidentally frees her as I'll cover further on the kids have these special powers of theirs that they're learning to understand Vivian in particular is a clairvoyant: able to draw the future whereas Geoff is able to gain information in form of telepathy or psychometry. These power themselves bear resemblance to the original powers of the children in the comic books, Vivian was able to see the fates of those she sees around her and gain post cognitive information although with a bit more pyrokinesis and Jeff is able to see ghosts much like in the series and gain information about people through similar powers and is able to electrocute people which the comic book version of Geoff can do albeit with magical blasts of energy and having a few more powers in his arsenal like teleportation, interdimensional travel,  and the binding of spirits Now the source of their powers is never elaborated on in the comic books although it is explained at least for Geoff as being a magical skill and perhaps due to their heritage whereas the TV show it's pretty explicitly explained as an innate ability that Geoff and Vivian have due to their biological heritage as they are adopted being the biological children of Alice Harlow both in the comics and in the TV show. Mind you this plot twist of them being adopted is kind of predictable once you learned that Deloris herself was not able to bear children due to injuries sustained now something that's very similar to the comic books is that the children react pretty badly after finding out that their adopted I'll be it under different circumstances with both materials but something that was different was that in the show the kids don't know at first that they have powers whereas in the comics they know from the start and are eager to become Monster Hunters much like their parents. Now the Allan estate has its own share of secrets: strange claw marks on a wall, Fred's dead brother and photos around the house, the cache of high-tech, high-powered weaponry and and who could forget the juiciest secret of all belonging to Fred and Dolores: the boring parents Jeff and Vivian being actual professional monster hunters working for a global monster hunting organization known as Presidio which is run by this woman named Edith now really quickly the original source material does have the parents being monster hunters albeit retirees who go back into the business after basically being thrusted back into the world of monster hunting from then on we have this mix-up of family drama, high school sucking a lot, monster hunting, and a conspiracy. You see after Fred and Vivian kill a vampire at a Barrington supermarket the mysterious murder becomes a crime of interest to the local sheriff Gina--an old friend Delores at the same time the mysterious woman from Vivian's vision who says she hails from Harlow or something uses her magic powers to break into a Presidio safehouse to track and hunt down the Allen's! Now weirdness is normal for Fred and Deloris but Vivian and Geoff are taken aback by their experiences with the unnatural: Geoff having some form of post cognition and able to divine information about the past which he uses to humiliate his teacher and Vivian as we saw earlier has visions of something and who ultimately prophetically draws an incident that happens earlier in the day wherein a red truck stalled in the road stopping a school bus which led to the Harlow the witch finding them and inspecting them where she then realizes that Vivian is the one who called and released her though by the second episode we learn that Samuel Allen isn't dead and is in fact alive and being interrogated by Presidio for some reason that I will elaborate on a bit later then by the third and fourth episode we get introduced to Jeff's ghost seeing and talking ability, we learn that someone or something has been killing the local vampire bikers as well as there being a mysterious cyborg with a red laser eye who follows Vivian of all people, then later we learn that Edith is involved in some sort of secret conspiracy that's concerned greatly with Sam Allen and a magic circle thing inscribed in the floor of Seth's room and we also see Harlow going to the Allen estate to reclaim an urn full of ashes and to the shock of Jeff and Vivian who learn that their parents are monste hunters so by now we have several mysteries set up: Who is this Harlow witch woman and what does she want? Why did Presidio kidnap Sam and what are they after? What is going on the kids? what is with the summoning circle Fred found? Who and what is this guy with the red eye? And most importantly who are the kids really? and what is with the mysterious urn that was hidden in the Allen estate? all these questions and their answers are all connected together tied up in a nice neat bow by the season's finale by the time the final episode rolls around this spooky witch who's been showing up all over the damn place, putting her nose in everyone's business, actually has a name Alice Harlow of the Warlock colony known as the Harlow village or the Harlow house this character is loosely adapted from the comic book although her comic book counterpart is featured in like a single panel wielding an axe before getting killed off by Fred and something I should also add is that Harlow village doesn't exist in the comics and instead it's the Harlow's house belonging to a serial killer couple who are implied to be working with monsters anyway she, as the rest of the Allens discover, is a warlock which in this universe is a race of people: innate magical practitioners who although look human are monsters. She in particular is noted to using blood magic and much like the rest of her kind is able to form a psychic bond of sorts with the universe and with everything within it this metaphysical bond is something that Vivian tapped into when she did her seance and inadvertently used to free her from her bonds and this underwater bondage thing being a result of a band of rebel monsters she joined, tying her up, and sort of drowning her in a lake because she was just too much for them to handle. Now, fun fact the word 'warlock' comes from an old English word meaning "oathbreaker" what exactly this oath is I\'m not a cunning linguist so I can't say but it's a very appropriate descriptor for Alice as it's due to her breaking several oaths that lead up to the life that she lives it now: she betrays the Harlow village by inviting a human into the premises which directly leads to the extermination of her people and the destruction of Harlow house. She becomes too 'killy' and revenge happy that she gets betrayed by her monster comrades who chain her up and then later she promises to be there for her children but fails to protect them from Presidio Mucho depresso. Now adding on to that the reason why she's sniffing around the Allens so much is because they were directly involved with the Harlow village massacre, with Delores and Fred having served as boots on the ground soldiers in a very grisly raid furthermore Sam Allen was the guy who oversaw the operation go down and who stole an urn full of the ashes of the warlocks which Alice then took back in order to take a blood bath like literally it's super gross-- to rejuvenate and restore her power and as I mentioned earlier we also discover that she is the mother of Vivian and Geoff. So now we need to talk about the urn and later the pentagram thing in Seth's room so first off the urn that is previously mentioned contains ashes specifically of the warlocks of the Harlow village. We see them actually doing a ritual which turns this old guy into the dust which are then stored in the urn. This ritual was done in order to allow the soul to move on at least in warlockian beliefs now warlocks use the ashes of the Dead in order to empower themselves which leads to Alice's big pro-gamer move later in the series when she brings back these souls of the Harlow warlocks back to earth and into the bodies of Barrington's populace which brings us to the pentagram thing in Seth's room which is linked to Presidio, Sam's fake death, the red-eye guy and surprisingly the Harlow warlocks: you see the pentagram thing in Seth's room is a form of warlock geometric magic more specifically soul magic that Sam used to bind the soul of his son Seth to a body of a convict in order to bring him back to life not to brag what I totally called it but anyway. Now because I read the comic book series this character, the red eye guy, does exist in the comics though he's portrayed as being more mechanical and is not Seth instead he's a young man named Dante who was the subject of a cruel experiment by a mad scientist who was sort of rescued by Fred before being placed into a box and left to sleep as he was too dangerous in Fred's words then later on the comic Dolores wakes him up as a ploy to get Fred back into the monster hunting business because her life without it is just really boring anyway the experiment for Sam is a success though Seth becomes a mute and furthermore is locked inside the house by Sam, now the problem is Seth is resurrected using decommissioned Presidio technology and Presidio really wants their stuff back so they kidnap Sam, fake his death, and interrogate him in order to learn how he used their technology so that they can use it to exterminate all monsters, oh, and although I didn't list it as a question earlier but in the TV show we encounter a mixed race team of monsters who are hunting Alice Harlow, this team however not having existed in the comics instead the closest thing we get to a mixed race team of monsters is in Deadly Season wherein Fred is kidnapped by the children of the monsters that he killed in the past who try to kill him in the  present so this plot was kicked off because Sam just wanted his son back but something I didn't mention is how Seth died. For a long time Fred was second best to Seth who was the golden child for the Allen family and one day the brothers went out hunting but Seth got ambushed and murdered to death by a monster named Moshe who did so out of revenge for his own family who were brutally killed by Seth a long time ago in a lot of ways this story's about the cyclical nature of revenge and killing that is bound to bring people to blows which is very much a theme in the comics as one of the motivating factors for the plot there is Fred's history of monster hunting and some characters usually monsters wanting some revenge against him now finally we move on to the timeline so overall the timeline of the series go something like this October 1975. Fred witnesses Seth attack a monster that's inside their home when he's a child and gets inspired to become a monster hunter 1987 an older Fred and Dolores go out to hunt a monster that killed Deloris's father October 1988 in New York Fred and Seth are out hunting in a bar where Seth is killed by Moshe, a monster's family Seth killed some time earlier then October 2001 Alice is residing in Harlow house or as I call it the Harlow village which leads to the mass purge of the warlocks by Presidio and it's here where Fred kills Omari Alice's husband and takes her kids and when Sam takes the urn full of the ashes back to his estate then comes October 2018 Sam conducts a ritual to bring back Seth back to life using warlock magic and succeeds in a manner of speaking then in 2019 in Osaka the Allen family get the call that Sam dies and the family moves to New York which is when the series begins but how does it end? Well, Fred is dead and is currently stuck in a limbo dimension with Omari, Alice's husband whom Fred killed, his soul separated from his body, Philip and Geoff are dating much like the comic book Vivian is happier with her life in Barrington Alice is still out there somewhere being hunted by Moshe of the monster squad Sam and Seth are still alive albeit locked up in Presidio which is now under the new leadership of Maggie, Fred's a mother, though the finale hints at season 2 which involves some sort of monster hidden beneath the basement of the Allen estate breaking out and it does not sound friendly and that'a season 1 of October Faction it amalgamates or removes characters adds more backstory or world building to what was an otherwise self-contained and focused setting and I honestly was really hoping we'd see Lucas and how he deals with lycanthropy or Merle Cope and his general dickish attitude towards the Allens. The plot line for season one is clearly separated from the main canon of the comics and it's anybody's guess what they're going to change in season 2 - although I'm thinking they're going to go a bit more into limbo and Fred's chance to come back to reality and if not that then obviously the monster hunting business that they have in the comics with that being said thank you so much for watching ladies and gentlemen if you enjoyed the video leave a like down below and subscribe to get updated on my latest uploads and leave your comments down below telling me what you think of this adaptation, what might come up in season 2 and what you liked and disliked about this adaptation and stay tuned for part 2 until next time
