Detective Recapped here. Today, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to explain a thriller film called, \xe2\x80\x9cElle\xe2\x80\x9d, which follows the sordid story of a woman who ordered takeout after getting violated. Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care. The indifference and ignorance of animals are, for the most part, completely forgivable. The fact that they do not know any better relieves them from any true accountability, at least by human standards. That same apathy is displayed one tragic afternoon by a cat owned by a red-haired woman named Michele Leblanc. Her cat sits motionless as a masked assailant comes into her home and breaks her things. Then, he forces himself onto Michele. Strangely enough, that same outward nonchalance is displayed by Michele. After the ordeal, she simply picks herself up from her living room floor to resume her life. As if on autopilot, Michele sweeps the broken glass immediately after getting up. After Michele takes a bath and orders takeout, her son, Vincent, visits her. When he notices her forming black eye, Michele lies about falling on her bike. They proceed to dinner, and Michele pre-emptively anticipates Vincent\xe2\x80\x99s request. She tells him she\xe2\x80\x99ll give him money for his new apartment on the condition that she\xe2\x80\x99ll look at it first. Vincent tries to be coy about it, saying he was planning to have her pay collateral and not money. As their conversation goes on, she openly disapproves of his pregnant girlfriend, Josie. After the dinner had concluded, Michele retrieves a mallet. She looks slightly unsettled as she looks out the night streets through her window. Later, Michele falls asleep with her the mallet in her hand. Despite the initial apathy Michele displayed, she\xe2\x80\x99s shaken by the experience in her own way. After all, not everyone will have the same response to trauma. The next morning, Michele goes to her job, where she\xe2\x80\x99s the head of a successful video game company. A meeting is held to discuss the current status of their latest game. Michele is a particular kind of woman who attracts a particular kind of attention. Being the head of her company, she has the right to be assertive and adamant about her visions, especially when they\xe2\x80\x99re within reason. But the male employees on board clearly hate her and don\xe2\x80\x99t value her opinion and instructions. Kurt, for instance, abhors her, and it shows as he challenges her during their meeting. But the man is left quietly seething when Michele flippantly shoots him down. The only one who adores her there is Kevin, who\xe2\x80\x99s open about how much he loves her, even if jokingly. After that meeting, she goes to the hospital to have herself tested for a possible S.T.D. because of what happened the day before. Afterwards, she goes to visit her aging mother, Irene, who has a penchant for Botox and hiring male escorts to sleep with. The behavior upsets Michele, as she finds it especially inappropriate considering her mother\xe2\x80\x99s financial situation. When Irene asks what Michele will do if she remarries, Michele bluntly tells her that she\xe2\x80\x99ll kill her. By the end of the day, Michele encounters her next-door neighbours, the married couple Rebecca and Patrick. As Rebecca and Patrick walk into their house, Patrick looks over his shoulder at Michele, and Michele seems to look back at him. Michele\xe2\x80\x99s cat approaches her when she walks into the house. Suddenly, she is reminded of the traumatic incident. She picks up the cat and half-jokingly asks why it didn\xe2\x80\x99t at least scratch the man. Things aren\xe2\x80\x99t finished yet, however, and Michele receives a message from her assailant, saying that she\xe2\x80\x99s tight for a woman her age. This text prompts her to shop for a self-defense weapon. She buys the most powerful can of mace there was and decides, on a whim, to also buy a hand-ax. Calling the police should have been the first thing that Michele\xe2\x80\x99s done when she was violated but instead, she slept with a mallet. And now, with her assailant texting her, she has all the reasons to believe that the man personally knows her. Still, Michele continues to take matters into her own hands as opposed to telling the authorities. After making her purchase, Michele leaves to park at a restaurant for a meeting. Michele parks poorly, and crashes her car into another one after mistakenly backing her car too much. But ever nonchalant, she just heads into the restaurant after acknowledging it. There, her ex-husband, Richard, greets her, and they talk about Vincent and about how broke Richard is. They both agree that their son\xe2\x80\x99s girlfriend is a psycho, and Richard comments that \xe2\x80\x98psycho\xe2\x80\x99 usually means \xe2\x80\x98good in bed\xe2\x80\x99. Suddenly, Michele asks him if he thinks she\xe2\x80\x99s tight for a woman her age. This takes Richard aback, and he just stares at her. Fortunately, Michele\xe2\x80\x99s friend and co-CEO, Anna, shows up, along with her husband, Robert. While they're discussing and lightly dismissing Richard's video game idea, Michele drops the bomb that she was attacked the other day. To their horror, she says that she guesses she was violated. Everyone is shocked by the news, and even more so when they find out that she hasn\xe2\x80\x99t contacted the police. After dinner, Richard speaks with Michele, trying to convince her to report the crime. Michele refuses, claiming she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to deal with the police ever again. The topic easily shifts to Richard\xe2\x80\x99s rejected video game proposal, and the exchange causes Richard to walk to his car, which is the one that Michele backed into. Unmoved, Michele lets him know that someone messed up his fender. Since there\xe2\x80\x99s a high possibility that Michele\xe2\x80\x99s assailant is someone who she knows, she\xe2\x80\x99s starting to question who took advantage of her. She repeated the text to Richard, and she isn\xe2\x80\x99t bothered at all that she damaged her broke ex-husband\xe2\x80\x99s car. It\xe2\x80\x99s unclear whether Michele suspects him, but given how fast and sudden everything happened, the assailant could be anyone. It could be Richard, Robert, or someone else entirely. The next morning, Michele and Vincent head towards his and Josie\xe2\x80\x99s upcoming apartment. When Michele arrives at the empty property, Josie deliberately gets on Michele\xe2\x80\x99s nerves by openly kissing Vincent in front of her. She even makes sure to look at Michele. Immediately, Michele realizes that the apartment is more expensive than the one that Vincent mentioned. Josie is set on this apartment as she thinks that the last one is a dump, but Michele calmly asserts that it may be basic, but it isn\xe2\x80\x99t a dump. Josie isn\xe2\x80\x99t having it, and soon, the two women have a heated exchange, and in the end, Michele withdraws her financial assistance. Michele arrives at her office where she\xe2\x80\x99s greeted by Robert. It\xe2\x80\x99s revealed that the two of them have been having an affair behind Anna\xe2\x80\x99s back. With Robert wanting to get pleasured, Michele blankly reminds him that she just went through a traumatic experience. Robert retorts that part of his character is being unpredictable before undoing and pulling down his pants. Then, he comments that he knows Michele\xe2\x80\x99s a wilting flower, but surely, she can at least touch his member. In response, Michele places a bucket right in front of Robert. It\xe2\x80\x99s clear that Robert cares as much about Michele as he does a bed because that\xe2\x80\x99s just what she is to him \xe2\x80\x93 his next lay. Still, he barely shows any concern towards Michele despite the tragedy that happened to her. It wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t even be a stretch to wonder if her assailant was Robert and that he was playing a sick game on her. Later that evening, Michele stays behind the office after work hours, and she suddenly receives another disgusting text from her assailant. This time, it\xe2\x80\x99s complimenting the colour of her blouse, adding that his seed won\xe2\x80\x99t leave a stain on it. Subtly perturbed, Michele slowly looks around the office, and she finds that the only person there that night is Kurt. If there\xe2\x80\x99s any man we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen so far who has a grudge against Michele, it\xe2\x80\x99s Kurt. If Kurt wants power over Michele and if he wants to break her fa\xc3\xa7ade of stoicism, then it\xe2\x80\x99s easy to imagine him as the assailant. But we don\xe2\x80\x99t know what Kurt wants, only that he\xe2\x80\x99s pissed at his boss. Michele meets with her mother Irene once again and she discusses the upcoming parole hearing of Michele\xe2\x80\x99s father. He was a popular mass-murder from many years ago. This is the primary reason why Michele refuses to ask the police for help as she fears that her father\xe2\x80\x99s reputation will affect how the cops will treat her. That evening, Michele notices an unfamiliar car roving about her neighborhood. Michele decides to pick up her can of mace along with her hand-ax. Michele goes straight to the car, breaks down the glass window with the hand-ax, and sprays the driver right in the face. This goes to show Michele\xe2\x80\x99s tenacity as a character, having no inhibitions in delivering vengeance and defending herself when the opportunity presents itself. Not many would choose to take up arms like she did in that situation. To be able to confront one\xe2\x80\x99s abuser is no small feat by any means. When the man comes out of the car, it is actually just Richard. Michele takes Richard into her home and helps him with the pepper spray in his eyes. Richard explains that he was just worried for Michele\xe2\x80\x99s safety because she refuses to ask for help from the police so he decided to patrol the vicinity himself. Michele asks Richard why he\xe2\x80\x99s using a different car, and Richard says that his car is in the shop and that he\xe2\x80\x99s borrowing a car from a friend. Michele immediately infers that the car belongs to Richard\xe2\x80\x99s girlfriend, Helene. Once again, his very presence warrants an examination of him as a suspect. Richard claims that he was patrolling the vicinity in concern for his ex-wife. Moreover, he\xe2\x80\x99s using a different car, which puts him in a suspicious position, though Michele did ruin his fender. However, having known Richard for the longest time, Michele doesn\xe2\x80\x99t doubt his intentions and instead focuses on the jealousy she feels towards Helene. One day in the office, Michele receives a lewd video of a CGI scene in her game, edited to make it look as if Michele was being abused. Again, Anna tries to convince Michele to approach the police but she still refuses. Later that day, Michele visits Helene at her workplace, where she sees that Helene\xe2\x80\x99s a young and beautiful yoga instructor. The awkward encounter results in an invitation for Helene to a Christmas dinner. Afterward, Michele returns to her car but gets interrupted by a call from Vincent, who reports that Josie is in labor. Michele rushes to the hospital to find Josie already on the way to the delivery room. Moments later, Josie\xe2\x80\x99s baby is successfully delivered with no complications. However, Michele is bothered by the fact that the baby has a much darker skin tone than both his parents. Michele, who is already wary of Josie, spots a tattoo on her left breast with another man\xe2\x80\x99s name, \xe2\x80\x9cEric\xe2\x80\x9d. When Michele drives home that evening, she is greeted by a couple of police cars. Rebecca explains to her that there was a suspicious character lurking about in her bushes. Apparently, her husband Patrick went and spooked the man away when he checked on Michele\xe2\x80\x99s house. This positions Patrick in a delicate situation. Mainly, one could think that Patrick may be the man lurking in the bushes. This puts yet another man on the list of suspects. Patrick offers to escort Michele back into her house which leads to Michele\xe2\x80\x99s fluttering attraction towards Patrick blooming into infatuation. Later, Michele reaches out to Kevin. She asks him to teach her how to shoot a gun then assigns him with finding out who sent the lewd CGI video of her. Being her admirer in the office, Kevin agrees, especially with Michele\xe2\x80\x99s handsome payment for the job. Christmas is nearing, and Michele is set to host a Christmas party for the people in her life. On the evening of the party, the complete cast of colorful characters fills Michele\xe2\x80\x99s dining table. Michele\xe2\x80\x99s table includes her elderly mother Irene with her young male escort of a boyfriend Ralf, her distant son Vincent with his troublesome partner Josie, and her ex-husband Richard with his young and pretty yoga girlfriend. Then, there\xe2\x80\x99s even her business partner Anna with her husband Robert, with who Michelle has an affair. And last but not least is her neighbor Rebecca with her husband Patrick, the man who Michele is currently seducing with her feet under the dinner table. At this point, we\xe2\x80\x99re face to face with many of the suspects. And yet, it\xe2\x80\x99s anyone\xe2\x80\x99s guess as to who it could be. However, it is strongly suggested that the assailant is most definitely sitting at that dinner table. It\xe2\x80\x99s a sight to behold with chaos brewing right after Irene announces to everyone at that table that she and Ralf are getting married. This prompts an applause from everyone at the table with the sole exception of the blunt Michele, who could not contain her laughter and her disgust for her mother. After dinner, the guests are all left to their own little activities. Michele finds Patrick sitting on the couch all by himself. She takes this opportunity to speak with him. However, among all of the topics Michele could\xe2\x80\x99ve chosen to talk about, she decided on recounting her childhood and how her life was ruined by her notorious father. Michele explains that when she was young, her father came home one day with blood on his hands. Crazed, he burned the entire house down on a whim, and the young Michele helped her father, not knowing exactly what it meant. Eventually, the police and the media came, took a photo of her amongst the burning rubble, and she was forever branded as the psychopath\xe2\x80\x99s daughter. Michele had since then worked the life out of her body just to bring her name from the brink of shame. This bit of narration from Michele is very revealing about her fears and her character. She doesn\xe2\x80\x99t trust the police at all, especially since they had misconstrued her image before. Michele was just a child; her life was ruined by her father, too. And if the police didn\xe2\x80\x99t bother with helping a child facing injustice, why would they bother with the now-grown psychopath\xe2\x80\x99s daughter? When Michele is done opening up about her life, she walks to the kitchen where she encounters her mother. Irene tells Michele that she was needlessly cruel to her. A small argument ensues which eventually leads to Irene having a stroke. The entire party is brought to a halt, and Michele accompanies her mother to the hospital. In the ambulance, Irene tells Michele to go see her father. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t know it at the time, but these are the last words that her mother would say to her. Whether Michele would come to regret her actions is left ambiguous. Either way, Michele would no longer have a chance to apologize to her mother. In the hospital, the nurse reports that while Irene\xe2\x80\x99s in a stable condition, there\xe2\x80\x99s little hope for her to wake up from her coma. That evening, Michele goes home to get some rest, and she\xe2\x80\x99s accompanied by her best friend, Anna. The two of them sleep side-by-side, snuggling for warmth. They recount the time when the two of them attempted to hook up. They didn\xe2\x80\x99t get to it, though, since at the time, the two of them couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stop laughing. Anna then gingerly kisses Michele\xe2\x80\x99s lips, and it\xe2\x80\x99s unclear whether it was platonic or romantic. The next morning, Michele is startled awake by Robert touching her thighs. At this time, Michele turns him down and ends their affair. With that, she visits her comatose mother. Michele speaks to her as if at any moment she would wake and reveal that it was all just an elaborate act to get back at Michele for hurting her. She keeps trying to convince herself of this, but she is soon confronted with a harsh reality as several nurses rush in to revive Irene, whose heart had just stopped beating. At this point, the only thing Michele could do is wish with all her heart that it was just a ploy, but the truth is that her mother is dead. Once again, she is left powerless Michele is not given much time to grieve since her assailant is still out and about. When Michele arrives home from the hospital, she spots her bedroom with the lights on. She equips her pepper spray and her hand-ax then proceeds to the bedroom. When she gets there, all she sees is her laptop with the words, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stop myself\xe2\x80\x9d flashing on the screen. This only reinforces the possibility that her assailant is someone who she knows. Bizarrely enough, the message can be interpreted as the assailant feeling remorseful for his actions. But it\xe2\x80\x99s also possible that it\xe2\x80\x99s another one of his twisted games to get under Michele\xe2\x80\x99s skin. Soon, Michele and her family start searching for a place to spread Irene\xe2\x80\x99s ashes. But as they\xe2\x80\x99re strolling on, Josie starts berating Vincent about a small mistake. This pitiful display prompts Michele to be frank with her son, saying that Vincent is obviously not the father of the child. Vincent erupts at his mother and he storms off along with Josie. When everyone had left, Michele and Richard throw Irene\xe2\x80\x99s ashes in the park by the water. During a windy evening, Patrick helps Michele close her shutters. Eventually, one thing leads to another, and they start kissing. However, Patrick suddenly stops himself and leaves. This is yet another suspicious bit of behavior from the men in Michele\xe2\x80\x99s life. While blueballing others and yourself doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that you took advantage of someone, Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s sudden refusal and escape remain questionable. After all, if he were the assailant, then sleeping with Michele might give away what he did. Later that day, Michele receives an update from Kevin about his special project. Kevin reports nothing significant about Kurt. Suddenly, Michele gets the idea of suspecting Kevin as well. She sneaks around after hours to access Kevin\xe2\x80\x99s computer. Soon enough, she discovers that the video was indeed created by Kevin. Despite the revelation, Michele senses no malicious intent from him, so she lets Kevin explain. Apparently, the video was just a ridiculous joke he had created for himself but one of the employees caught wind of the video and sent it to everyone as a joke. Michele wonders if Kevin was her assailant so she orders him to strip. Unlike her assailant, Kevin\xe2\x80\x99s member is cut, so she lets her grudge towards him go, just like Kevin has to let that extra payment go. Michele comes home after a long day and receives the crib that she had ordered for her grandchild. She places it on top of the table with its strap dangling from the edges. Suddenly, her masked assailant ambushes her from behind and once again tries to force himself on her. With her worst nightmare repeating itself, Michele is determined to fight back. With a stronger grip on herself, Michele gathers her strength and refuses to be used once more. She grabs the crib strap to pull it towards her, and it hits the back of the man\xe2\x80\x99s head. Then, she grabs a pair of metal scissors and pierces it through the man\xe2\x80\x99s hand. Finally, Michele can discover the truth behind the man who violated her. She pulls the ski mask off and to her surprise, she sees Patrick. Enraged, Michele threatens Patrick with the scissors, demanding him to leave the house. The following morning, Michele spots Patrick across her front gate. Patrick wears his suit on the way to work as if nothing had happened. Seeing this, Michele realizes that discovering her assailant\xe2\x80\x99s identity means nothing as she still refuses to turn to the authorities. And so, Michele is caged in a peculiar and tragic conundrum. Her own assailant is living right next door, and she has no one to turn to. Despite her distaste for the police, Michele resolves to see her father after discovering that his parole had not been approved. Though this is difficult for her, Michelle keeps her mother\xe2\x80\x99s final wish in her mind, and she has unresolved issues of her own with her father. In an ironic turn of events, Michele\xe2\x80\x99s father hanged himself the same morning that Michele went to see him. This leaves her upset over not being able to tell her father of all the things she wanted to get off her chest. However, she takes comfort in the fact that her despicable father had decided to kill himself rather than to face the daughter that he had ruined. Somehow, she tells herself that it was she who killed him in the end. Michele is driving home from the prison, when suddenly, she receives a call from the press asking for an interview about her father\xe2\x80\x99s recent passing. With all that\xe2\x80\x99s happened, Michele\xe2\x80\x99s still rattled by the events. She gets distracted from the road, and she fails to see the deer that\xe2\x80\x99s crossing the street. In the long list of Michele\xe2\x80\x99s misfortunes, one would think she\xe2\x80\x99d be spared from yet another terrible event. But as it stands, Michele is stuck inside her tilted car. She calls several of her friends and family for help but none of them are available. Out of everyone she could have called, and out of everyone who could have answered the phone, it\xe2\x80\x99s Patrick, her very own attacker, who comes and helps her get out of the car. Michele and Patrick return to Michele\xe2\x80\x99s house. He looks after Michele\xe2\x80\x99s wounded leg and applies first aid. At this point, Michele confronts Patrick about why he forced himself on her. To this, Patrick admits that it was the only way he could get turned on. Feeling ashamed, he leaves abruptly. Several other conclusions occur over the next few days. Robert and Michele have their one final session before officially ending their affair. Vincent comes home with his infant son after being kicked out by Josie. On that very day, Josie comes barging in to retrieve her son. The irresponsible Vincent is distraught mostly over losing the baby. Michele finally understands this and the two of them reconcile. One day, Michele and Vincent stumble upon Patrick while doing groceries. He tells them that his wife\xe2\x80\x99s out on a long trip, and he\xe2\x80\x99s left with too much food in the house. Patrick invites the both of them over, and Vincent readily agrees. As for Michele, she mulls it over for a second, but strangely enough, she also says yes. That evening, a still-distraught Vincent drinks too much of the wine. This leaves Patrick and Michele alone together. In a rather dark and strange turn, Michele remains attracted to Patrick. She seduces him and in turn, Patrick leads Michele down to the basement where no one can hear them indulging in their deplorable delights. What follows next is sickening and twisted, to say the least. Patrick grabs hold of Michele and beats her, making her fight back and thrash on the ground. Still, she looks at Patrick and tells him, \xe2\x80\x9cDo it\xe2\x80\x9d. Patrick stops abruptly, the excitement leaving his body. He explains to Michele it only turns him on when that the other person is being forced. Upon hearing this, Michele hits Patrick, which quickly re-invigorates him. After the perverse lovemaking had finished, Michele goes to Vincent and tells him they\xe2\x80\x99ll be going home. Michele is going to be having a party for their game\xe2\x80\x99s launch. At their latest meeting, Michele finally gives Kurt credit for doing a good job. Michele even entrusts the planning of the party to Vincent. Things are falling into place for the final act. All the characters are present, and they\xe2\x80\x99re finally getting what they want. However, there still hangs a dark and foreboding aura in the air. Before the launch party begins, Anna admits to Michele that she thinks Robert is cheating on her. This surprises Michele, and she simply feigns her ignorance. During the party, Michele first greets Robert, who recently got dumped by Helene. She cheers him up by asking him to coordinate with Kurt for his story ideas for a new game. Meanwhile, Patrick is also there, and he gleefully dances with Michele as if they\xe2\x80\x99re a normal couple. Then, Michele spots Robert and Anna flirting with each other. Upon seeing this, she tells Patrick that she needs to do one thing before the two of them leave. Tired of living a lie, Michele admits to her best friend that the woman Robert was sleeping with was her. Anna is speechless with Michele, and she directs her anger towards Robert. With this, Michele and Patrick take their leave. In spite of everything in this strange and dark climax, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to tell whether Michele has accepted this new relationship. Is she willing to accept this deplorable situation? Is this provocation part of the game they play? Or is she sincerely plotting to get rid of Patrick once and for all? On the car ride home, Michele tells Patrick that their relationship is sick. She tells him that at the end of the day, she will still report him to the police. Patrick looks to Michele in disdain as the two of them reach their neighborhood. Michele goes down the car first and enters her house at a deliberately slow pace. Just as she expects, Patrick is there in the darkness of the kitchen with his ski mask on. Once again, Patrick tries to force himself on Michele. Believing that Michele\xe2\x80\x99s playing along, Patrick doesn\xe2\x80\x99t see Vincent coming in with a blunt object. Vincent smashes Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s head so hard that it injures him fatally. Patrick musters the last ounce of strength he has to stand up, and he looks at Michele in bewilderment, asking her \xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d Finally, Patrick slumps down on the floor and Vincent breaks down after being the one who killed him. In turn, Michele comforts her son, telling him that it\xe2\x80\x99s all over now. Despite the ever-looming threat being gone, things in Michele\xe2\x80\x99s life will forever be changed. Will these changes be beneficial? Or will they be yet another scar in Michele\xe2\x80\x99s broken psyche? Eventually, the police come and Michele sends in her report. In the end, Rebecca doesn\xe2\x80\x99t resent Michele for killing her husband, fully understanding that Patrick is a troubled individual. Before leaving the neighborhood, Rebecca admits that she\xe2\x80\x99s thankful that Michele was able to provide what Patrick needed for a time. As Rebecca leaves, Vincent and Josie drive by Michele\xe2\x80\x99s house on their brand new convertible. After proving to be an excellent event organizer, Vincent finds his calling and takes his responsibilities to heart, winning back Josie and their son. Michele visits her parents\xe2\x80\x99 grave at the cemetery. Suddenly, Anna appears and she approaches Michele to make amends. Anna tells Michele that she kicked Robert out of the house. With this, Anna concludes that her house is too big for her and it would be best if the two of them lived together. After all, the only thing they have left is each other. The two best friends walk on to greet their more peaceful future. Elle is a dark and controversial movie that leaves audiences divided whether the story is powerful or pointless. The film is less of a whodunit thriller and is more of a character study of Michele Leblanc, who is a morally dubious person to say the least. Michele was subjected to terrible things by terrible people, but she herself engaged in cruel acts, like being unnecessarily harsh with Josie and her mother and having no qualms about sleeping with her best friend\xe2\x80\x99s husband. Among the myriad of things that characterized her ruthlessness, it is the complexity of her character that leaves a valuable impression in cinema. One of the takeaways we\xe2\x80\x99d like to mention is the film\xe2\x80\x99s critique of patriarchal society. That there is a twisted desire to put down or humiliate strong women perhaps on a psycho-analytic level that not many people realize. However, despite the imperfections of her character, it is with that same strength that Michele was able to liberate herself from her assailant. Most of all, she managed to liberate herself from the shackles of her past. By the end of the movie, Michele had the strength to accept that she didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to face the world alone.
