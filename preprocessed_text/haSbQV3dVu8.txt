Marty McFly's romp through time makes back to the future one of the best movie trilogies of all time so we here at cinematic ax compiled The Back to the Future trilogy in one comprehensive timeline to make everything digestible will be following Marty's experience to the story instead of jumping around and starting chronologically in the 1880s also we're not covering the Back to the Future cartoon show or the telltale videogame but let us know in the comments if we should dive into that expanded universe and make sure to subscribe to cinematic I ready I've got to get back in time October 25th 1985 Marty McFly's adventure begins when he pays a visit to dr. Emmett Brown house that's filled with alarm clocks and Rube Goldberg esque breakfast making machines eat your heart out pee-wee Herman doc isn't home but that doesn't stop Marty from trying his gnarly oversized amplifier the arguably mad scientists soon calls Marty and asked him to assist in an experiment at Twin Peaks Mall late that night Marty agrees then realizes he's late for school and rushes out the door on his skateboard but he's too late mr. Strickland catches him and calls him a slacker just like his father after class Marty and his band audition to play at the school dance but are just too darn loud defeated he vents to his girlfriend Jennifer in the heart of Hill Valley Courthouse Square site of the infamous clock tower that was struck by lightning 30 years prior precisely at 10:04 p.m. on November 12 1955 at home Marty runs into his father George McFly and George's supervisor Biff Tannen Biff totaled the family car which Marty desperately needed to take Jennifer out of town that weekend Biff takes no responsibility and bullies the sheepish George into paying for the car damage and cleaning his beer stain suit at dinner Marty's mom Lorraine drowns her sorrows and booze reminiscing on her quote/unquote innocent youth she had fallen in love with George back in high school after her father hit him with his car she felt sorry enough for him to let him take her to the enchantment under the sea dance where they shared their first kiss and fell in love forever a little pathetic but hey that's the power of love October 26 the 1985 at around 1:15 a.m. Marty meets Doc Brown at the mall and sees his newest invention a time-traveling DeLorean if you're gonna build a time machine into a car why not do it with some style it's all possible thanks to the doctors ingenious flux capacitor along with 1.1 on gigawatts of electricity powered by plutonium dangerous stuff so they're wearing radioactive proof suits the DeLorean needs to hit 88 miles per hour for everything to come together so doc remotely powers the car as his dog Einstein plays guinea pig and has launched exactly one minute into the future wait let's back up a second where exactly did Doc Brown get the plutonium well he may Libyan terrorists a fake bomb but hey what could possibly go wrong the naturally the Libyan show up and MODOK down with machine guns devastated Marty runs for his life using the DeLorean to escape once Marty ramps up to 88 miles per hour he's suddenly whisked past the Libyans straight to November 5th 1955 the day Doc Brown inputted because it was the day that he came up with the flux capacitor November 5th 1955 Marty still traveling at 88 miles per hour finds himself suddenly warped from a paved mall parking lot to an abandoned sleepy farm and careens into a barn Marty stumbles out of the DeLorean to greet a bewildered family still wearing the hazmat suit they figure he's an alien so pod tries to blast him with a shotgun Marty jumps back in the DeLorean and speeds off taking out one of the properties to pine trees on the way once he has the time machine Marty heads to town to search for Doc Brown so he can get back to the future he's stopped by the local diner to find his address at the phone book while he's sitting at the counter high-school-aged Biff charges in and barks at McFly but if isn't talking to marty marty is actually sitting next to his very own father Marty's curious about just how spineless his father always was so he tails him for a bit well not only is George a wimp it turns out he's also a peeping tom Marty finds him sitting in a tree spying on Lorraine as she undresses george slips and falls from the tree into the path of an oncoming car so Marty dives in and pushes his father out of the way getting hit instead when it comes to he finds himself being in respect to health with a beautiful young daughter the man who hit him Marty's own mother and she's not exactly being coy she took his pants off while he slept geez at least this gave Marty an easy fake name written on his underwear Calvin Klein Lorraine gets even more handsy during an awkward dinner with Marty's extended family including a baby version of his convict uncle Marty finally decides to dip and rush over to Doc Brown to explain the situation the doc doesn't believe him at first naturally I mean Ronald Reagan the actor as president don't be ridiculous that's like electing a reality TV star but once Marty tells him about the flux passenger docks convinced they go pick up the durian and discreetly transport it back to Doc's garage November 6th 1955 without access to plutonium doc thinks all hope is lost to generate 1.21 jigowatts for the flux capacitor they'd need to harness the power of something like a lightning bolt fortunately they know exactly when and where lightning will strike that's Saturday night at 10:04 p.m. doc can surely finagle a way to make all that work in the coming days only one problem Marty kinda jeopardized his own existence see George was supposed to get hit by that car not Marty that was the clumsy catalyst that led to them falling in love without this Marty will never be born he now has until the enchantment under the sea dance on the 12th to reignite the spark between his parents November 7th 1955 that Monday at school Marty tries to convince George to ask Laraine to the dance but he's not very successful everyone thinks George is a loser even mr. Strickland thinks he's nothing but a slacker plus Biff has the hots for Lorraine and George can't step on those massive toes but Lorraine doesn't want Biff's meat hooks she only has eyes for Calvin Klein seems like Marty will have to get a bit creative November 8th 1955 early in the morning Marty dances radioactive protective suit and sneaks into George's room to use his ultra futuristic Sony Walkman to scramble George's brain with some van Halen see George is a big sci-fi guy and even writes him himself so when Darth Vader from the planet Vulcan demands that George take Laraine to the dance you know he listens the next day George down some chocolate milk can build the courage to announce that he is Lorraine's density I mean her destiny it's actually going well but then Biff shows up Marty sensing trouble trips Biff decks him in the face and leads him and his cronies on an extremely exciting chase through the streets after inventing the skateboard Marty heroically maneuvers to safety as Biff crashes his car into a truck full of manure get used to that smell Biff it's a really cool scene but unfortunately way too cool Lorraine's already attracted to Marty but now she thinks he's an absolute dream of a man she follows him to Doc's place and gets Marty to reluctantly agreed to take her to the enchantment under the sea dance but that doesn't mean he's giving up on George just yet November 9th 1955 the next day Marty reveals his plan to George he's gonna get a little too handsy with Laraine in the parking lot before the dance after all his mom always seemed like a prude she'd never even parked with a boy George would then come to her rescue and put Marti in his place sweeping the rain off her feet of course that means Marti has to feel up his own mom but it might be the only thing that can save his existence November 12th 1955 on the night of the dance Marty's plane backfires in the most uncomfortable way possible Lorraine is more than ready to park with Marty smoking a cigarette and downing some booze before launching herself at him fortunately she stops herself reeling in disgust and realizing that kissing Marty feels like kissing her brother unfortunately Biff shows up very pissed off his goons throw Marty in the trunk of a car as Biff closes in on Lorraine George shows up to play hero but he wasn't expecting to see Biff and yet he doesn't back down Biff twists George's arm behind his back then he shoves Lorraine to the ground that pushes George right over the edge and he knocks Biff out with a single extremely satisfying punch the dance-band freed Marty from the trunk so he saw the whole thing but he's still fading from the photograph George and Lorraine still need to seal the deal with that kiss the band guitarist Marvin berry cut his hand while freeing Marty so our hero ends up playing guitar in his place when some random pencil-neck rudely interrupts George and Lorraine's dance Marty is nearly wiped from existence but George has a changed man he cuts back in kisses Lorraine and Marty springs back to life then Marty introduces the young 50s crowd to Johnny be gud which Chuck Berry apparently plagiarized before scaring them off with some 80s metal they're not quite ready for it yet but their kids are gonna love it by the time Marty meets doc he is the clock tower set up for the DeLorean Marty tries to warn talk about the Libyan terrorists but doc refuses and rips of Marty's detail field letter he doesn't want to mess up the time-space continuum you see as they're arguing a fallen tree implies the lighting rake damn with only seconds to spare doc climbs the tower and Marty hops in the DeLorean car won't start and the court doesn't have the necessary slack damn damn but it all works out Marty starts the engine puts the pedal to the metal and hits 88 miles per hour at the precise moment doc plugs the rig back in the Lightning hits the DeLorean and Marty blasts back to the future at last October 26 1985 Marty actually set the clock a few minutes before he first left in order to warn doc he's too late when he finally gets to the mall now alone he sees his friend gets shot to pieces once again he watches himself travel back to the past and runs to check on Doc Brown who somehow still alive yes universal integrity and scientific caution is important in all but doc figured what the hell he taped Marty's torn letter back together and wore a bulletproof vest Marty goes home and passes out but when he wakes up he realizes everything is different his parents are now healthy wealthy and have charming personalities to boot his dad is a successful sci-fi author now but the best part Biff is basically his Lackey scrounging to wax George's car and everything all seems well as Marty embraces his girlfriend Jennifer until Doc Brown warps into the scene with The Time Machine he hails from the future he's been exploring warning Jennifer and Marty that their kids are in trouble they pile into a car and take flight because who needs roads blasting off into the future and leaving a bewildered Biff as witness October 21st 2015 in the far-distant sci-fi future year of 2015 our trio warps conveniently into the flow of traffic of an air highway understandably Jennifer immediately starts freaking out so Doc Brown sedates her and just kind of leaves her in an alley doc explains to Marty that his son Marty jr. will end up getting roped into a doomed robbery by bifs grandson Griff to make matters worse Marty's daughter Marlene will then attempt to break Marty jr. out of prison the plan is simple Marty will pose as his son and refuse to take part in grifts plan Marty enjoys some luxuries of 2015 Power laces self-drying jackets hoverboards and 18 jaw sequels before heading into an 80s themed retro diner complete with Michael Jackson Max Headroom white staff Marty jr. shows up and Griff confronts him about the robbery but Marty successfully pulls the old switcheroo and stands up to Griff he says no but Griff calls Marty a chicken tries to hit him with a bat Marty successfully evades the bullies as they crashed into the courthouse causing insane damages and leading to their arrest with the future altered doc and Marty can go back to 1985 but the police find the unconscious Jennifer and just kind of dump her at her old ourselves home in Lyon estates Marty and Doc Rush after her but before they can intercept Jennifer wakes up and finds herself spying on her future family turns out Marty's had a lifetime of misfortune I mean needles just got him fired by calling him chicken but it all stemmed from when Marty crashed into a Rolls Royce back in the 80s he injured his hand ruining his music career and the rolls-royce driver sued him ruin Jennifer soon runs into future Jennifer and both faint out of shock could be worse the whole time-space continuum could have imploded when dr. Marty arrived at Lyon estates they leave the DeLorean unattended to rescue Jennifer but remember how Biff's are the DeLorean back in 1985 he's been suspicious ever since especially after seeing two Marty juniors in town after eavesdropping on doc and Marty he follows the pair and hijacks their DeLorean in the short minutes it's unguarded zipping to the past and back before anyone can notice Marty and Doc returned to the time machine and head back to 1985 vowing to destroy the thing to avoid any further messes October 26th 1985 we're back to the past but things seem a bit off not only are there bars on Jennifer's windows but Marty's house isn't Marty's house Marty runs off into the dystopian hellscape that once resembled his neighborhood an armed to the teeth mr. Strickland catches poor Marty on his property but he's saved by a conveniently timed drive-by how the hell is this 1985 so different well Marty finds out as he stumbles into Courthouse Square now completely in the shadow of a massive hotel casino owned by none other than Biff Tannen according to the Biff Tannen Museum Biff crew was fortunate empire through a number of well-placed sports bids over the past few decades with his new power he married his high-school crush Marty's mom Lorraine Biff Scoones knock Marty out and he wakes up next to a different version of Lorraine she's been clearly abused and forced to get plastic surgery by her new husband Biff roughs Marty up and forces Lorraine to submit by threatening to throw her kids in jail but wait where's Jorge well he's been dead for over a decade and Biff killed him Marty rushes to his father's tombstone and meets doc who was waiting for him back at the lab Marty and Doc discuss how this dystopia came to be doc discovered part of Biff sk\xc3\xa5ne in the DeLorean along with the receipt for his sports Almanac that Marty bought in 2015 if must I eject the DeLorean and give him the Almanac to his past itself since the new 2015 has already been Biff eyed they have to go back to the past and get the Almanac before young Biff Ken Marty head straight to the casino to find out just when Biff first got his meat hooks on it sure enough if boasts about how an old man gave it to him on November 12 1955 and made him swear to keep it a secret but he also warned him that a young man would one day ask about it well that day has clearly come so bifs ready with his handgun but Marty distracts Biff for like the eighth time in the trilogy darts to the roof escapes with doc in the flying DeLorean now they have to race back to November 12 1955 to fix the past huh again November 12 1955 it's almost as if it were the temporal junction point for the entire space-time continuum on the other hand could just be an amazing coincidence November 12 1955 Marty stocks Biff throughout the day and waits until he receives the almond but can intercepts until Future Biff thinks his mission is accomplished Marty hops into the back of Biff's newly maneuver free car as fifties Biff and Future Biff come face to face in the front seat 50s Biff pulls into his garage and Future Biff proves the almanacs power by accurately predicting the final score of a UCLA football game on the radio Future Biff leaves marty is trapped in the garage until 50s Biff heads off to the dance that evening keeping the Almanac close to the fast even at the dance party just can't find the chance to nab it things get even trickier when mr. strickland confiscates the book from Biff marty slips into Strickland's office and under his desk waiting for the perfect moment but strickland simply dumped the Almanac in the wastebasket before leaving Marty finally has his hands on it but it's actually just the Almanac cover over a girly magazine panicked Marty needs to track down Biff and the real Almanac fast thankfully he knows exactly where I'll be knocked out in the parking lot by his father Marty pretends to give Biff CPR in front of the crowd and lifts the Almanac from his unconscious body home free right and wrong this goons chase Marty right into the gym he evades them but now they're waiting for the other Marty to get off stage if the bullies beat him up he'll never make it to the clock power and a universe destroying paradox will occur so this movie's Marty traverses the stages catwalk and knocks the bullies out with some sandbags in the nick of time now all Marty has to do is meet doc by the roof Biff now conscious confronts Marty outside of the gym all our hero has to do is walk away but when Biff calls him chicken his feathers are ruffled Marty turns to confront Biff gets knocked out by himself Biff baffled at the two calvin klein's notices the Almanac in Marty's possession and flips his lid he kicks Marty when he's down and makes off with the Almanac once more once he comes to Arnie rushes to doc and they make after the villain in the DeLorean Marty tries to sneak up on Biff with this hoverboard but the bonehead catches on and they start fighting for the Almanac while in the tunnel Marty geniusly uses the walls to maneuver over the car and snatch the future telling sportsbook too bad Biff is all ready to play chicken with his car Marty scrambles to the other end of the tunnel as fast as he can and thankfully gets a lift from Doc is Biff crashes into a truck full of manure again once they're outside of town Marty burns the Almanac has docked precariously a harbor is above in the heavy rainstorm sure enough the DeLorean gets struck by lightning and disappears Marty assumes it was blown into a million pieces but a western union representative shows up to deliver a mysterious letter from 1885 it's from Doc Brown it turns out he's still alive to save doc marty rushes to the only person who can help doc but the Shaka Singh Marty back from the future again causes poor Emmet to pass out in the street of Courthouse Square November 13th 1955 the next morning Doc Brown wakes up unaware that marty dragged him home the night before Marty shows him the letter which explains how the bolt of lightning activated the DeLoreans flux capacitor launching the good doctor back to the Wild West unfortunately this also fried the capacitor and the necessary parts to fix it won't be invented until 1947 doc doesn't mind being trapped back in time he's gleefully living out his fantasy as a blacksmith he stowed the DeLorean in the nearby mine for Marty and Doc to uncover and repair in 1955 all they need to do is blow the DeLorean out of the mine and send Marty back to 1985 for everything to be solved and phony was that simple November 14th 1955 once he blasts the time machine out Marty discovers the tombstone of Doc Brown himself the tombstone reveals doc was shot and killed by Buford Mad Dog Tannen over a matter of $80 a mere six days after writing the letter September 7th 1885 at least he apparently woulda beloved Clara before he crouched Marty decides to travel back to the old West to rescue doc for he meets this grisly fate November 16th 1955 with 50s Doc's blessing and the DeLorean all fixed up Marty dresses up in western garb and prepares to warp to the 19th century marty reaches 88 miles per hour activating the time machine at a drive and outside of town which will surely be empty 70 years earlier September 2nd 1885 well of course Marty warps right into the path of a group of armed Native Americans charging on horseback while being chased by cavalry Marty manages to drive to safety and hide the DeLorean in a cave but notices the fuel line was severed by an arrow a black bear emerges from the cave and Marty Sprint's away tripping knock self out at the property line of the McFly's yep his own ancestors he awakens next to his great-great grandma Maggie McFly who looks exactly like Lorraine but wait isn't this the dad's side of the family anyway Marty states his name is Clint Eastwood and they share an awkward dinner with Marty's great great grandfather Seamus McFly Maggie has her suspicions but Seamus outfits his descendant with a hat and agrees to help him find his blacksmith friend doc September 3rd 1885 Barney heads into town and acquires at the saloon about the local blacksmith unfortunately Biff's outlaw ancestor Buford Mad Dog Tannen shows up and doesn't like the cut of marbs jib or his goofy future clothes Mad Dog shoots at Marty's feet but Marty uses his Billie Jean Michael Jackson dance moves to evade and humiliate the outlaw yet another chase ensues Mad Dog glasses a noose around Marty's neck drags him around town and hangs him in front of the courthouse luckily Doc Brown shows up and shoots Barney free with a macgyvered rifle Mad Dog and Doc verbally spar on the street over Mad Dogs recently shooed horse his horse's shoe broke can Mad Dog put the horse down so Mad Dog figures doc owes him 80 bucks even though Mad Dog never paid for the showing in the first place doc has a backbone so he refuses to pay Mad Dog vows to shoot him in the back Marty shows Doc the photograph of his own tombstone and dr. grease to get the hell out of Dodge the only problem is the DeLorean scuff fuel line sure the flux capacitor still works the DeLorean can't hit 88 miles per hour without fuel September 4th 1885 document ride to use the saloons ultra-strong whiskey to power their time machine that only blows out the fuel injection manifold they're running out of ideas when Doc suddenly has a brain blast they can use a locomotive train in a long stretch of straight land near town to physically push the DeLorean to 88 miles per hour before it reaches Clayton's ravine well actually it's currently still shamash ravine the schoolteacher named Claire Clayton hadn't fallen in it yet and had the landmark named after her sure enough as doc and Marty are scoping the site out Clara comes barreling out of control towards the ravine doc races to her wagon to rescue the fair teacher forever altering history they look into each other's eyes and immediately fall in love September 5th 1885 the plan is set doc and Marty just need to wait for the next train to come through town at 8:00 a.m. on September 7th in the meantime might as well enjoy the town festivities at the Hill Valley festival or the this clock for the tower is being inaugurated doc is enjoying a dance with Clara when mad dog shows up to put a pistol and Doc's back Strickland's ancestor thought he confiscated all of Tannen's gangs arms but he missed this extra discrete one Mad Dog is about to bury a bullet in Doc's back but Marty uses a prototype frisbee to hit Buford's hand just in time saving Doc's life but before Marty can bail Mad Dog pulls out Marty's trigger word Lasorda he calls marty yella and nobody calls Marty chip yella so he agrees to duel Buford 8:00 a.m. Monday morning but that shouldn't be a problem Marty he'll be well on his way back to the future by then unless the train is late of course September 6 1885 the next day Marty takes a look at the tombstone photograph and the name is now blank it seems like Doc's safe but the gravestone is still there so one of them could still be in danger doc consider staying back in the Old West with Clara and even taking Clara with them but ultimately he decides the responsible moves to return to his proper time without Clara he goes to her door to explain that he's from the future but Clara doesn't believe him and kicks doc to the curb breaking both of their hearts lost doc heads to the local saloon and holds a shot of whiskey as he tells the local patrons of his woes and of the future September 7th 1885 Marty wakes up alone and confused doc is nowhere to be found he rushes back to the saloon and quickly convinces doc to get a hold of himself doc finally takes that shot of whiskey but unfortunately one shot floor ISM and now he's drunk on his ass the local barkeep whips up some disgusting wakeup juice and successfully revives the doc but all this commotion wasted far too much time it's nearly 8:00 a.m. and Mad Dog is here for Marty's head the future tombstone photograph now says Clint Eastwood and that's Marty remember Marty and Doc tried to slip out the back but then Doc gets captured marty has to rescue his friend first he tries piece surrounding his Colt Peacemaker his side and offering to settle the affair like men the mad dog pulls in Indiana Jones and shoots him anyway somehow Marty stands up unharmed Mad Dog tries to punch him but breaks his hand on the furnace face hidden under Marty's clothes Marty's socks the bewildered Buford breaking the newly carved future tombstone and knocking him into a wheelbarrow of manure the tombstone vanishes from the photo and our pair rushed to hiya I mean borrow the train for a science experiment meanwhile Clara's on a one-way train to San Francisco but over here are some men discussing the completely heartbroken and they met in the saloon the night before she realizes that Doc Brown truly was in love with her and races back to her love doc and Marty successfully play Wild Bunch taking the train for their science experiment and switching the track in time to meet up with the DeLorean Marty chills in the DeLorean well doc overheats the trains furnace and they're well on their way to 88 miles per hour doc heads to the front of the train to join Marty but suddenly Clara jumps aboard the train via horseback she confesses her love for sweet Emmett Brown so he slowly works his way back to grab her but if they're not in the DeLorean in time the train will fly off the unfinished tracks into the ravine Clara and Doc are running out of time but Marty tosses them his trusty hoverboards they can glide to safety staying in the 19th century as Marty blasts back to the future for the final time October 27th 1985 Marty is finally back in the normal 1985 where he belongs but the DeLorean stalls and the now complete train tracks he barely gets away before a modern train smashes the DeLorean to bits at least doc got what he wanted with the destroyed time machine Marty checks in on Jennifer she's still passed out on the porch from the last movie and she wakes up confused by her crazy dream before Marty can explain himself on the way home needles pulls up in his truck and challenges Marty to a race and call some chicken Marty is all ready to leave needles in his dust but makes the mature decision to bail he's not stupid enough to race that [ __ ] Marty and Jennifer watch needle speed ahead narrowly avoiding a Rolls Royce that Marty surely would have hit just then you're fired facts that Jennifer snagged from 2015 fades in her hands and Marty's future looks bright Jennifer and Marty go back to the DeLorean debris Laden tracks to reminisce when a different kind of train arrives out of nowhere it's the doc from the past he's turned an old locomotive into a time machine and has been exploring the history of time with his wife Clara and his two sons Jules and Vern doc gives Marty the commemorative clock tower photo they took in 1885 before flying into the end credits ready to embark on countless adventures with his family and a cartoon spinoff series Great Scott that was pretty heavy but we hope we helped make Marty McFly's adventures through time just a little bit clearer what time lens would you like to see us tackle next here at cinematic ax just let us know in the comments below and blast to the Future and see if we listened and if you don't have a time machine can always subscribe to cinematic ofor more timelines just like this one I've been your host Marcus thanks for watching
