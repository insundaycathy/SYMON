listen. every once in a while, there comes a film that truly encapsulate s--. the American experience. regardless of how divisive these films are or the bad reception they may receive, these cinematic masterpieces aren't here to entertain the standard mortal man, but to cement of statements. Malcolm dealies, the night school does just that. let me elaborate America. in the opening frames of this Motion Picture, Kevin Darnell Hart takes a stand against standardized testing, proving that it's a part of a system rigged against the average man. as he grows up to wife a successful decorator, his characters, subtly named Teddy Walker, gets walked on as society's double standard stuffs him with norms that he can't bear. as George HW Bush's son once eloquently said, there's an old saying in Tennessee, I know it's in Texas, probably Tennessee, this fool me once, shame on shame on you. before we can't get fooled again. and thus, teddy goes back to the drawing board. the setting of the night school clearly symbolizes the second chances we in America can receive if it wasn't for the man laying down his wood, blacks Hispanics, soccer moms. that's it. proves everyone can achieve greatness if we all just work together and commit crimes that benefit the betterment of society. no other film in the history of American cinema has been able to get to the heart of the subject like heavens has. how the will a man can be pushed to his limits until he breaks through. Henry Fonda and Grapes of Wrath. Humphrey Bogart in Casablanca. Kevin Hart as Teddy Walker. night schools mrs. scene alone proves that this is American movies trash. go watch searching instead. you
