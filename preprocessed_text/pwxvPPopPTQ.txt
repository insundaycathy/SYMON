Welcome to Slash Forward. In this episode, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to get just a little bit closer to the end of the franchise storyline with Saw 6, working our way through the traps as we go. If you\xe2\x80\x99ve done the math, you\xe2\x80\x99ll recognize hitting the like button to be the correct moral action. To start, I\xe2\x80\x99ll unpack the storyline to see what we can learn. Let\xe2\x80\x99s get to it. We open on a young woman, tickled awake by a playful cockroach. She stands up and pulls a tripwire, then realizes she\xe2\x80\x99s adjacent to her pal Eddie. Simone tries to warn him not to lean forward, but Eddie\xe2\x80\x99s a legit dum dum. With both of them activated, they trigger Billy\xe2\x80\x99s entrance, at which point he explains to these payday loan sharks that it\xe2\x80\x99s now their turn to turn in their pound of flesh. They are in a competition to load as much of their soft tissues into the trays before them as possible before time runs out. The loser gets a pretty sweet skull piercing as a consolation, and then the bolts dig in a little, just to make it real for them. Eddie has a thirst for life, and is real quick to start cutting some bacon off his belly, but Simone\xe2\x80\x99s all trim and fit, oh no. So instead, she focuses on density and ponders a contribution of pure lean body mass. However, growing desperate when she gets stuck on the bone and seeing his scale moving, she cleaves that sucker right off. This tips the scale at the last moment, winning her the game. We then come in on the end of the last movie, and watch Hoffman dust himself off as he circles around to reset and tidy up his kill room. Just in case he has a need for it in the future. After that we meet up with William the doucher, cancelling birthday plans with his family so he can have a drink with Debbie, his lead council. They have to review his deposition strats for the case of Mr. Abbott\xe2\x80\x99s policy cancellation, and practice their David Caruso impressions We see via flashback that William related an oral surgery thirty years prior to Mr. Abbott\xe2\x80\x99s current heart disease, using this undisclosed prior condition as a justification for ending his policy. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t take it well. As Will nails his answers with ease, he clarifies for Debbie - our stand in - that the dog pit identified this discrepancy for him, because they\xe2\x80\x99re all over it. They love cutting policies and playing hard as hell. Meanwhile, Hoffman arrives at the most recent crime scene where the feds are already in charge. Turns out, there were some prints retrieved that match agent Strahm, a disappointing shock to them all. Confident in their suspect, Erickson then reveals his secret weapon - a still alive agent Perez. We find out that she and Strahm had been investigating the building fire from the last film, but had to cut it loose when their witness, Mallick the tweaker, went missing. Hoffman is sour about this deceit, but they all make a pact to hold no more secrets. The basis of any good friendship. When Hoffman returns, he finds journo Jenkins looking for a statement. She wants a lead, and she\xe2\x80\x99s looking for a juicer, admitting that she\xe2\x80\x99s aware of the box that Jill Tuck recently inherited. She offers to dial back her sensationalist rhetoric if he can get her close to Jill. We then learn, through Hoffman interviewing the most recent victim there is still some confusion about duress. Also, that Simone has declined to learn anything about her ordeal, an unfortunate, missed opportunity for personal growth. Circling back with Jill, then , we see her having a wine and ultrasound party. She giggles about it to herself, and then returns to her precious box, embracing her inherited folders in rapturous joy. When Pam Jenkins calls to request a meet up, we learn that she\xe2\x80\x99s actually folio number two. Hoffman has another flashback, this one as a reminder that everyone is to be tested, and then he learns that the federalis know the jigsaw piece cut from Eddie was not made with the same knife as any of the other victims other than Seth Baxter, Hoffman\xe2\x80\x99s sister\xe2\x80\x99s killer. So, they\xe2\x80\x99re also looking deeper into the associated tapes to verify if they reveal different voices at their core. Feeling the pressure now, he goes to meet up with Jill at the clinic to announce that the game begins tonight, and he\xe2\x80\x99s going to retain total control. He demands the envelopes, which she had conveniently forwarded to her office, apparently, and then lets her know that when he\xe2\x80\x99s done, they\xe2\x80\x99re done. Then we get more insight into Jill\xe2\x80\x99s more recent willingness to be involved to some degree. Her motivations are driven by her failure to see true rehabilitation at her clinics. The drugsters always come back. Except Amanda. She\xe2\x80\x99s cleaned up her act and is proof of concept for John\xe2\x80\x99s method. We then check back in with old poopface Will, taking in some news which gives him a lot to chew on. But then the lights go out and, seeing a shrouded figure approaching with a gun, he adopts a shoot first approach, resulting in a terrible mistake that he does not have enough time to try to fix. He wakes up at an oxygen bar, sucking on that mango pineapple O2. He gets a personal message from John that says hey, thanks, for giving me a chance to learn how to live through dying. William has sixty minutes to pass four tests or the explosives on his arms and legs will do what they do. Luckily he\xe2\x80\x99ll be provided motivation to proceed, unluckily it comes in the form of his incarcerated family. His first test is easy, though. He just has to be able to hold his breath longer than this lifelong smoker, because every time they move the accordion, their torso compressor closes in a little. They each hold their breath real hard but, try as they might, they just can\xe2\x80\x99t go an hour without breathing. Of course, Will\xe2\x80\x99s got a pair of swimmers on him, so he wins the chance to watch his partner get squeezed like a ketchup packet while he is released from the trap. Once out, he recognizes there is a foreign object inside his body, but also is able to grab a key to release one of his wrist bombs on his way out the door. With a moment to breathe now, we see the mother/son duo are in a cell with a huge tank of hydroflouric acid attached to a sprinkler system and a lever that\xe2\x80\x99s just begging to be pulled. Meanwhile, uptown, Ms. Jenkins arrives at Jill\xe2\x80\x99s apartment to show her a document she found. She asks her to take a look at it and give her a call if it means anything to her. This is also where she gets snatched, and this is where Hoffman keeps his special pictures. Back in the maze, William thinks back fondly on his first meeting with John, who critiques his underwriting formula for failing to consider the human will to live *until faced with death* we are talking about medical conditions, correct? Coming out of this, Bill finds his next test - he\xe2\x80\x99s forced to take up the pillars of Hercules, and then funhouse Billy drops in to point out his policy would value this young, childless clerk over his older, child-bearing assistant. Now he gets to see what it\xe2\x80\x99s like to make a direct choice. Failure to do so will result in both their deaths. As their chains are reeled in, he weighs his options and makes a wise choice. In response to her gratitude, he offers some kind words and then leaves Addy to disentangle her own barbed-wire noose so he can focus on getting his hands free. Elsewhere in the facility we see that Jenkins has her own cell full of acid. She wakes up and also has her own tape, which lets her know she\xe2\x80\x99s here due to exploiting John\xe2\x80\x99s pure message of redemption. Jill finds herself at the hospital with a look of steely determination. As she walks the hall she flashes back to the rack where John and Hoffman have a mild disagreement about how to treat the victims, and there is a little bit of disciple jealousy as well. Jill met him here to ask him to stop. Instead, he just assures her he\xe2\x80\x99ll provide her a way out when it\xe2\x80\x99s all done and gives her a key to the box. She then drops the parcel and moves along. Back at the maze, William appears to have fallen asleep, and is searching for Freddy Kreuger. This is the perfect time for an inception back to a prior memory of when John pitched an experimental therapy he wanted to get in on. Not only did William deny it, but if John did it on his own, he was going to cancel the whole policy on his ass. This was a very eye-opening meeting about culpability. When he comes to, he\xe2\x80\x99s arrived at the next test. Debbie has a brain-piercing device strapped to her torso, rather than her head, and she has to make it across a catwalk to the finish. William is meant to help her through and be there at the end to assist with the key. She works her way along, occasionally needing to take turns getting straight blasted in the face with some steam. And she makes it across, where it\xe2\x80\x99s revealed that the key to her salvation has been inside him the whole time. She attempts to extract it with overhead chops from a circular saw. She must\xe2\x80\x99ve forgotten how he helped with the steam, so he thrashes her soundly, and her device goes off, effectively removing her impulse control. Completely. For Will, it\xe2\x80\x99s just on to the next one. Hoffman then gets interrupted from his evening plans with a request to meet up about the Seth Baxter tape. When he arrives at HQ, it\xe2\x80\x99s revealed that they found some inconsistencies with Strahm\xe2\x80\x99s fingerprints, indicating they were not made with a living hand. The tape they discussed is being analyzed, but it\xe2\x80\x99s off site, so they head out together to check the results. Meanwhile, William gets to a door and hears his crew screaming for help inside. When he enters, he finds them playing hard, natch, but they\xe2\x80\x99re sad despite twirling upon the best playground ride available. Then Billy pops in to say what\xe2\x80\x99s up. We learn the dog pound here will spin around and get blasted by a shotgun. He can only save two of them. He has barely a moment to think his way through when the first victim gets racked up and, just to show it\xe2\x80\x99s for real, blasted in the chest. When a young mother eases in, he makes his first selection. But this sets the rest of them to lying about whatever they can think of to convince him they\xe2\x80\x99re worthy, while also calling each other out. This influx of information overwhelms him, condemning some of them to death. He snaps out of it to make his second selection, which is not the final person, so he\xe2\x80\x99s forced to listen as his employee maligns him while he aligns with the gun. At that time, Hoffman and the others arrive at the audio shack where the expert toils away in a dark closet. She\xe2\x80\x99s right on the verge of breaking the algorithm to reveal the true voice. As the pressure rises, Perez starts questioning Strahm\xe2\x80\x99s motivations. Despite the fact that we get a strong sense they suspect Hoffman, they are taken completely unawares when his voice pops up. He turns on them and only Perez gets off shots, but it\xe2\x80\x99s directly into her co-worker. Once he gets her against the wall, he insists on knowing who else knows before running to his trunk to get his finger-printing device. He tosses a few around before dousing the room and firing it up. Jill arrives at the command post and sets up a special document for Hoffman to find. While in the cell, Brent decides he\xe2\x80\x99s a man of action and goes for the lever. However, he does seek his mommy\xe2\x80\x99s permission first. He switches it to live and nothing happens, so he flips it a bunch and leaves it on die. His mom has a lightbulb moment, though, and sets it back to neutral, just in case. At that time, William is searching for the exit and Hoffman returns. When he does, he finds the paper. We find out this is a note that he wrote to Amanda. She had been with Cecil on that fateful night, and was the one to entice him to do the job. Hoffman held this over her, compelling her to kill Lynn to prevent him from spilling the beans. Jill then waltzes in to reveal that Hoffman is sitting on an electrified chair. From this we learn that the mysterious box we can\xe2\x80\x99t stop thinking about contained a bear trap for Hoffman, because all will be tested in the end. As she works on this, William rushes through the final door with only a moment to spare. Then the walls pull back and we learn that his only family is actually his sister Pam Jenkins. The other pair are Mr. Abbott\xe2\x80\x99s widow and son. John then comes on to reveal that the game has shifted and William\xe2\x80\x99s final judgement is to come from them. Tara gets all high and mighty about her duty to prevent future deaths by killing him, but still can\xe2\x80\x99t bring herself to do it. Although, her speech charged up Brent who pulls the lever, swinging down a giant grid of large gauge syringes that fill William with the acid they\xe2\x80\x99ve been staring at this whole time. Jill starts Hoffman\xe2\x80\x99s timer and heads out. So, as William melts away from the inside, Hoffman demonstrates his will to live first by crushing his own hand to escape, and then cramming his face into the window bars to limit the traps capacity to open. He\xe2\x80\x99s then able to slip down and out of the head gear and walk away with only minor injuries. Well that was both pleasant and enjoyable. It really makes me wonder what we\xe2\x80\x99ll bear witness to in the penultimate installment. But for now, let\xe2\x80\x99s focus ourselves on the task at hand, by working through these traps. We\xe2\x80\x99ve gone back to simpler times now, and find ourselves with a single trap participant working his way through a variety of fairly locked down puzzles. The difference here, obviously, is that it\xe2\x80\x99s not so much about ensuring your own survival as it is trying to bring as many additional survivors out with you as possible. The movie opens with the flesh scale. If you recall, Simone and Eddie had head devices with tension bolts applied to their temples. Whoever lost the challenge, as determined by the scale, would get a full insertion resulting in a permanent headache. This trap gives us very little to go on, focusing on the character\xe2\x80\x99s decision and will to win. We don\xe2\x80\x99t get to see much about how this headgear is attached or what their surroundings consist of. Although, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure searching surroundings would be particularly effective, because they had a very tight timer on this one. I had several thoughts about this puzzle that mostly hinge around winning rather than ensuring mutual survival. To that end, I did wonder if it might be possible to work the flat portions of the two larger bladed items between the bolt and your skin, thus distributing the force across a larger area. If the bolts decided to go for a drive, your survival would come down to which gives out first - the strength of the headgear and its various attachment points and joints, or the structural integrity of your skull. Outside of that, I think this one comes down more to psychological warfare. It would behoove you, especially if you saw your competition going to town on their flanks, to play it up like you didn\xe2\x80\x99t have what it takes to strip your flesh. Give them the idea that maybe they\xe2\x80\x99re in for an easy win to slow them down a bit. Simone\xe2\x80\x99s area seemed to be fairly open, and there is a corner back here that has some stuff behind it. If there is anything there that could reach down the tubes to push the tray, she could hold it down and score an easy victory. There didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be any limited range of motion for the victims, the trap just tries to keep them confined to the table by locking down the tools. However, while the tools are chained, those chains appear to be attached to wood. It seems like your next best bet, after convincing your opponent you\xe2\x80\x99re falling apart mentally, would be to try to keep your back to them and use the cleaver to chunk out wedges of the wood until you could wrench some of the tools free. Let your partner load up their scale like they\xe2\x80\x99re at a keto farmer\xe2\x80\x99s market, and then turn at the last moment to load your side up with a bunch of metal implements. We then move into William\xe2\x80\x99s trials. Broadly speaking, he has sixty minutes to complete his four tests. The problem is that most of these tests do require someone to die, but I think there are a few opportunities contained throughout. When he first wakes up, he finds himself in the oxygen exam. What we come to learn is that breathing in causes the device to crush them little by little until they die. It\xe2\x80\x99s not clear exactly what kind of breathing device they have on them here. The accordion portion seems to go up pretty dramatically even when William was breathing normally while unconscious. If it\xe2\x80\x99s a life support-style device, any inhalation will likely result in it pushing air into you, meaning that sensor is going to get tripped no matter what. This is important, because my first thought was what if they just take shallow breaths to avoid moving the sensor? The problem, though, is that there is no time limit here. If one of them doesn\xe2\x80\x99t die, releasing the other, the global timer will run out and William will die along with his family. So, there really is no choice here but to compete to win and, based on their mutual efforts to try to bypass this, it seems you\xe2\x80\x99re likely to beat this other guy no matter what. This quickly turns into a trap where it would be ideal to try to put it behind you and move on. He then enters an area where he has some time to scavenge for useful items. Just right off here I see some useful rocks, and potentially useful shards of glass for cutting. There is also tubing hanging down and all sorts of other things. Who knows what other strange and useful items may be contained inside these display stages. It should also be noted that the keys to his extremity bombs are just hanging from strings beyond each task. Any puzzle that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t require him to be locked down or imperiled in some way could be skippable. However, they cover this with a simple red light, implying there is some sort of proximity sensor connecting each bomb with the trap that comes before it. This is actually very useful, because while it\xe2\x80\x99s intended to keep him in the general area of the test, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t specifically drive him to start it at any particular time. In the case of the iron cross here, he is again forced to let someone die with rules set up that preclude him from saving them both via the game. Either they both die, or he can save one. However, just because he can\xe2\x80\x99t move past doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean he has to pick up the handles right away. In this instance a strong case could be made for taking rock to glass. Once inside, you could unwrap their necklaces to prevent further injury. You could even then go through with the process of the game to register your choice and make it easier to ensure your ability to get the next key. Next up is the stomach piercer, which is a confusing name, because it\xe2\x80\x99s intended to shred your frontal lobe. Nonetheless, they went with a torso attachment. I immediately identified that you could just angle your body and head in such a way to avoid full penetration, and was vindicated when they let slip a couple of frames that reveal just that. Because I was looking for it, it was clear they tried to shoot around this and make sure Debbie never moved her body in such a way that made it apparent. However, they tried to jam me up at the end by having the contraption do a little readjustment of its position prior to delivering its load. I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure this is the most efficient way to take out a person\xe2\x80\x99s brain, but I understand the desire to introduce variety here. Regardless, while it still may be possible to shuck and jive your way out of this, there is also just the raw power of teamwork as an option. There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of tools inside the finishing area, many of which may have been a possibility for opening up William\xe2\x80\x99s wound to retrieve the key, but also he could have held onto a shard of glass from the previous area as mentioned. With all the steam and heat, it seems like they could have created a fairly safe and sterile surgical environment, and possibly even had access to blood flow-stemming cauterization afterward. If Debbie could just refrain from acting like an ass for a few seconds here. Before finishing with Hoffman\xe2\x80\x99s trials, we\xe2\x80\x99ll take a brief moment to note the absurdity of Tara\xe2\x80\x99s test here. The end result feels a bit tacked on, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not entirely sure what it\xe2\x80\x99s supposed to prove or why it\xe2\x80\x99s happening. She recognizes this is her test, but why is she being tested? She is a victim of William trying to raise her snotty son as a single mom. Is she not paragliding on the weekends enough to demonstrate she\xe2\x80\x99s got life by the balls? And also, what is the consequence here? It\xe2\x80\x99s not stated. He tells her only to pick live or die for William, there are no other rules or requirements. There is no time limit, and there is no other challenge. It\xe2\x80\x99s not clear why she has to pick live rather than do nothing, or what would happen if she leaves it on neutral. Perhaps it sprinkles the acid in their cell or in Pam\xe2\x80\x99s cell? But these potential twists are never stated. It makes me wonder if we have some important scenes on the cutting room floor that would have elucidated the point of all this. Which is too bad because, without them, this isn\xe2\x80\x99t really a challenge at all. Finally we\xe2\x80\x99ll talk about the two primary challenges faced by Hoffman. The first is the kill room where he managed to take out multiple, armed FBI agents with a knife. Now, if you\xe2\x80\x99re Hoffman, you did well, but we\xe2\x80\x99re going to examine how lucky he got in the way this unfolded. First off, as I said in the summarization, the agents were letting on like they had an idea Hoffman was involved here. I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure why they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been watching him more closely. Erickson pulls back his jacket and, as experienced G-persons, both of them should have their right hands open and available for their weapon. This is drilled into them in training and becomes a lifelong habit for law enforcement. But, if they did it because they were preparing themselves, they negated their ability to act by then also lining themselves up with Hoffman in the middle. This is a recipe for disaster, because it puts you in a crossfire situation. Of course, this didn\xe2\x80\x99t stop Perez from putting three rounds into the center mass of her desk jockey friend here, so I\xe2\x80\x99m not really sure where her mind was at. I think the coffee to the face was overplayed a bit. When small droplets of liquid hit open air, they transfer their heat energy fairly rapidly. He\xe2\x80\x99s picking up an evening pot of stale ass coffee and tossing it across the room. The result was probably more startling than painful, but I would expect a trained agent to be prepared for this. Further, jamming a screwdriver into the power strip would not have the desired outcome, so they would have had full vision. If you arc a piece of conductive material between the two ports of an outlet, you can get it to pop and possibly burn out. A single port shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a problem, but even if it is, this is a power strip. It likely has built in surge protection, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a separate unit plugged into an actual wall outlet. It seems unlikely that it would trip the breaker for the entire room, or that the entire room is on a single breaker. If agent Perez was suspicious, which the movie led us to believe, her best position would be to listen from the computer station, to the left of the audio expert. This would have put her and Erickson at angles in front of Hoffman, allowing either of them to draw down on him with no targets of concern downrange while still being able to listen and watch him at the same time. Last up is the bear trap. Here is another one that Hoffman successfully navigated, so I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure we could find a better outcome. Hoffman got out of the chair, and he cranked on it with some tools. Were better tools available for the job? Possibly, but we didn\xe2\x80\x99t get to see what all was there, and this was his workshop. So, if he had a C-clamp or some vice grips or something like that, presumably he would be the one to know and employ them. The bar trick is actually a pretty slick move here, and likely only possible because this was a trap that didn\xe2\x80\x99t have its own, purpose-built room in which it unfolded. But, then again, this wasn\xe2\x80\x99t really a \xe2\x80\x9ctest\xe2\x80\x9d in the traditional sense, because there was no key to recover once the test was passed. I do wonder, after the trap was sprung, could he not have just left it between the bars, or reclosed it manually? The trap is set by human hands so it seems like it could be. It also raises some odd questions here about the viability of some of the other set ups in that he was able to just slide his head out of it despite how low it rested on the back. Pulling down hard will now be a reasonable last resort moving forward. Here is another installment where the average person would come out looking pretty good. There is going to be pain, but the challenges are mostly emotional, requiring the participant to choose who to save while watching others die, rather than putting the participant in actual mortal danger. As a result, I would have to say that you would survive, but the degree to which you would be \xe2\x80\x9cokay\xe2\x80\x9d is really dependent on how effectively you could compartmentalize your actions from their consequences.
