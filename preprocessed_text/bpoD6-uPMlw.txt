EPILEPSY WARNING AT 1:56 SKIP TO 2:00 IF YOU ARE SENSITIVE Welcome to Cinema Summary, ladies and gentlemen. Everything changes for 3 friends after a hunt for a hacker goes terribly wrong. This is The Signal So this is Nic, he's a cripple with a heart of gold and he's smart enough to get into MIT [The Massachusetts Institute of Technology] Now he's on road trip with his girlfriend, Haley, and his best friend and fellow hacker, Jonah, who is trying to track down a mysterious hacker known as Nomad. Now, Nomad is really good at hacking: wayback when, Nomad hacked into MIT\xe2\x80\x99s servers which got Nic and Jonah\xe2\x80\x99s curiosity. That night, Nic and Jona stay at a motel, where Nic and Jona get another message from Nomad and it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t say much. So Nic, fed up with Nomad, tells him \xe2\x80\x9cWe will expose you\xe2\x80\x9d. Only to get another message a few seconds later, Nomad has hacked into Haley\xe2\x80\x99s laptop and is using its webcam to spy on Nic and Jonah. And then they realize that Nomad is a hacker on a whole nother level. So they track NOMAD\xe2\x80\x99s IP address and figure out Nomad\xe2\x80\x99s real world location: somewhere in Nevada. So off they go to hunt down Nomad. On their way there, they stop at a gas station and we learn a bit more about the group: Nic has become distant to Haley, because Haley\xe2\x80\x99s moving to go to a different school, away from Nic and Jonah which is putting some stress on Nic and Haley\xe2\x80\x99s relationship. When he and Haley talk about her moving, he confesses that he feels like he\xe2\x80\x99s holding her back and he\xe2\x80\x99s afraid that when they break up: it\xe2\x80\x99ll hurt. And Haley takes it as well as you would. After driving into Nevada, the group tracks NOMAD\xe2\x80\x99s location to an abandoned house in the middle of nowhere. So Nic and Jonah go to investigate and they bring a video camera to film the whole experience. And after some searching, they find a room that leads to the basement and down here they find some strange server racks. And that\xe2\x80\x99s when they hear a scream. Haley! They run upstairs to find Haley is gone and the car doors are left opened and when they turn around they see Haley get violently pulled up into the sky and they rush after her as a bright light glows brighter and brighter until finally... He\xe2\x80\x99s in some sort of facility where people in hazmat suits work; he\xe2\x80\x99s put in a wheelchair and taken to a room. Meet Dr. Wallace Damon, he is a scientist that\xe2\x80\x99s part of a team that\xe2\x80\x99s trying to understand what happened to Nic and his friends: because Nic and his friends came into contact with \xe2\x80\x9cThe Signal\xe2\x80\x9d, which is an alien lifeform or as they describe it an \xe2\x80\x98extra-terrestrial biological entity\xe2\x80\x99. And to make matters worse, Nic and his friends may have been contaminated by The Signal in some way. And then Nic starts bleeding from the nose and Damon walks over to Nic, reaching forward and wiping it away. He\xe2\x80\x99s relieved: it\xe2\x80\x99s just blood. That\xe2\x80\x99s the end of the \xe2\x80\x98first\xe2\x80\x99 session\xe2\x80\x99, and Nic is taken back to his room where he finds a set of numbers tattooed on his arm: 2.3.5.41 as well as a seatbelt that\xe2\x80\x99s locking a blanket over his legs (Huh, weird). And then we see that Nic is being watched from behind one-way mirror. it looks likes he\xe2\x80\x99s going to trapped here. Maybe, forever! But slowly he begins making a plan to escape, he just needs to figure out a few things first. We then see Nic get wheeled around the facility, and we see that there are rooms being deeply cleaned but then he passes by a room and he sees Haley, unconscious! Something\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with her! But what? And Nic desperately tries to get in there but he\xe2\x80\x99s taken away to his next session with Damon. And it\xe2\x80\x99s here, Nic asks him what\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with Haley and Damon brushes him off and begins interviewing Nic. This time Nic is strapped to a lie-detector and asked a series of questions. Like \xe2\x80\x9cDo you have 10 toes?\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cAre you from Earth\xe2\x80\x9d Dumb questions but he answers them After he answers the questions, he\xe2\x80\x99s shown the recording of the night he and Jonah went into the house. And then we see a face with big eyes, hiding in a tree. Nomad isn\xe2\x80\x99t just a hacker: Nomad seems to be an alien. Nic is still shocked by the time he is brought back into his room when he hears coughing from the vents and he realizes it\xe2\x80\x99s Jonah! He begins talking with Jonah through the vent and he finds out that they are somewhere underground, contaminated with an alien virus or bacteria, and that the scientists did something to Jonah. In their next session, Nic asks Damon why the clocks don\xe2\x80\x99t work specifically the one at 7 windows back, left turn, 4 windows, right turn, 2 windows on the right, next to the bathroom with the sign that\xe2\x80\x99s upside down. That clock. And Damon just brushes it off as a \xe2\x80\x98broken clock\xe2\x80\x99. After doing a stupid test for Damon, Nic makes a deal with him: I\xe2\x80\x99ll only do more tests IF you take me to Haley So Damon takes Nic to see Haley, and when Nic checks the clipboard there\xe2\x80\x99s no information written on it. Strange. But Damon explains that Haley\xe2\x80\x99s in a coma and that she\xe2\x80\x99s being cared for, so Nic doesn't have to worry. And Nic is taken back to his room where gets to work on his plan and the first step is to make a device that allows him to blow cracker dust on the keypad lock to figure out the password. He shares the password with Jonah but Jonah tells Nic that he\xe2\x80\x99s not feeling too good: ever since he drank some weird stuff, Jonah can\xe2\x80\x99t feel his arms anymore. And then we see Damon overseeing an experiment where a cow is in a room, and slowly a door in the back opens. Damon plays a loud noise and then the lights black out in the testing room and after a few moments a chair hits the window. That\xe2\x80\x99s when the lights come back on, we see the cow hiding behind a pillar and an alarm is ringing. But we have no idea what just happened, but don\xe2\x80\x99t worry, I\xe2\x80\x99ll explain this later. We then see Nic get pushed along a hallway, as the lights turn off and the alarms turn on And we overhear an announcement \xe2\x80\x9cA Subject has escaped\xe2\x80\x9d. As Nic gets taken back to Damon, he sees gouges scratched into the walls of the hall. What could have done this? In the next session Nic asks Damon what happened to the hallway and about Jonah. But Damon doesn\xe2\x80\x99t tell him about what happened in the hallway but he does tell Nic that Jonah\xe2\x80\x99s body was never recovered: he was never here in the facility. And Nic\xe2\x80\x99s confused: Then, wait, who was I talking to through vent? And Damon is like \xe2\x80\x9cReally? Through the vent? Are you sure about that?\xe2\x80\x9d Leaving us and Nic, confused. The scene ends and we have no idea if Damon is lying or if Nic is going crazy. And the next thing we see Is Damon in Nic\xe2\x80\x99s room, lifting his mattress, to find Nic\xe2\x80\x99s escape plan because Nic has escaped. And he has taken Haley with him, dragging her bed behind him, attaching it to his wheelchair. Dodging scientists and he almost manages to escape but at the last moment he is stopped by the scientists. We then see a montage of Nic running and spending time with Haley. These are his memories and when Nic wakes up, he\xe2\x80\x99s staring into Haley\xe2\x80\x99s eyes. She\xe2\x80\x99s awake now and they talk for a while only for Haley to go back to sleep. And Nic begins freaking out and tries to reach for Haley. The scientists in the room try to push him away but accidentally push him off the bed. And as soon as they realize this, the scientists leave the room. Nic sees black blood on his fingers and then he sees his legs. And we see his legs are robotic. And he begins freaking out a bit but manages to calm down and like any man makes sure it\xe2\x80\x99s only his legs and not his [Whistle] that\xe2\x80\x99s robotic. And then Damon confesses, they knew about this: the scientists saw that his legs had changed and were interested in how he got them. But they didn\xe2\x80\x99t want him to freak out so they kept his legs covered up until now. And Nic uses tape to cover his legs with a blanket and Nic decides then and there that he\xe2\x80\x99s getting out of here. He kicks down the door using his robotic legs taking Haley with him, into the elevator. He's made it! But Damon stops them and pleads with Nic to stay down here, because only down here can Damon protect Nic from \xe2\x80\x98them\xe2\x80\x99. As to who or what Damon is talking about? We don\xe2\x80\x99t find out as the elevator door closes and Nic escapes with Haley taking her outside to the middle of nowhere. As Nic and Haley walk through the desert, they\xe2\x80\x99re picked up by a woman in an old car and as they drive. Suddenly, she stops, listening to a noise. \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s God\xe2\x80\x99s little angels.\xe2\x80\x9d Her words, not mine. So she\xe2\x80\x99s obviously crazy. They stop at a gas station, with Nic going into the nearby service center, where he makes a call as Haley waits near a big rig truck. But Nic can\xe2\x80\x99t get signal on the payphone and to make matters worse, there\xe2\x80\x99s a PSA on TV warning people not to come in contact with him. And Haley just went into the big rig truck and the truck is driving away. So, Nic chases after the big rig truck and tries to break in only to get knocked off by the driver. But guess what? This just makes Nic even more determined to save Haley and he starts sprinting and thanks to is robot legs, he can catch up with the truck pretty quickly. And as the driver reaches for his gun, Haley threatens him with his own gun, and kicks him out, driving away with Nic, leaving the driver on the side of the road. And as they drive away, they suddenly stop Because in front of them is a dead end. The road is missing. Meanwhile, we see Damon interrogating the woman from earlier, and she\xe2\x80\x99s gone crazy. Repeating herself, saying random things, and just like Nic, her nose starts to bleed and as he sees this, Damon opens his red briefcase where inside there\xe2\x80\x99s a gun. This can\xe2\x80\x99t end well. Nic and Haley drive around until they find themselves at an abandoned visitor\xe2\x80\x99s center. Nic tries to find something inside that might help them but there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing although Haley has found a map and looking at it they realize that something\xe2\x80\x99s wrong. The way they drove doesn\xe2\x80\x99t match the map that he\xe2\x80\x99s looking at, and as Nic tries to figure out where they went wrong, he realizes Haley\xe2\x80\x99s outside. And outside, she asks him if he hears \xe2\x80\x98that noise\xe2\x80\x99. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t hear it and he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know how to get out of here. Their best bet is to go across the river but that\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a challenge and right now, they\xe2\x80\x99re tired so can think about it tomorrow. They sleep at at the visitor\xe2\x80\x99s center only to get woken up in the middle of the night by a noise. And we see outside the visitor center a team of gun men in hazmat suits approaching the building. Damon and his team have found them! And as Nic and Haley hide behind a desk, Nic peeks around the corner to our surprise he finds Jonah\xe2\x80\x99s there! So Damon isn\xe2\x80\x99t at the visitors center, he\xe2\x80\x99s actually visiting the truck driver from earlier, trying to find out where Nic and Haley are. And just like the woman from earlier? The driver has gone a bit crazy and has become childish, talking about his mommy and his kitty until he finally snaps and tries to kill Damon with a shotgun. Damon just shoots him dead. As Hailey sleeps, Nic finds a spinal implant and some numbers on Haley\xe2\x80\x99s back. He still has no idea what happened to them well he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t but Jonah does. Y\xe2\x80\x99see, as Jonah and Nic talk, Jonah reveals something very important: That ID number on Nic\xe2\x80\x99s wrist and presumably Haley\xe2\x80\x99s back? That\xe2\x80\x99s not for a person. It\xe2\x80\x99s for an area: Area 51, the legendary military base of the US Airforce. So in case you didn\xe2\x80\x99t know, is a real place. It\xe2\x80\x99s a United States Airforce facility situated in the Nevada. Kept under heavy guard and kept top secret so much in fact, that you can\xe2\x80\x99t even see it on Google Earth. They censor it. And because of this secrecy there are a lot of theories as to what\xe2\x80\x99s going on there, and a lot of those theories believe that alien technology is being studied at Area 51. Which would explain why Damon is so interested in Nic and his friends: he wants to understand how they\xe2\x80\x99ve changed, he wants to understand why they\xe2\x80\x99ve changed, and he probably wants to know how he can use them. At least that\xe2\x80\x99s what it seems like. So this whole area: the little town and the roads and the buildings? They\xe2\x80\x99re fake. It\xe2\x80\x99s all under the control of Damon and his team. And that\xe2\x80\x99s not the only reveal that Jonah has for Nic: Jonah\xe2\x80\x99s also changed. His hands are robotic just like Nic\xe2\x80\x99s legs. So there are a few things about Jonah that you might not have realized yet: #1) He was at the facility Damon lied to Nic when he said that Jonah wasn't there just to mess with Nic\xe2\x80\x99s head. Secondly, Jonah was in the room with the cow, he was supposed to kill the cow with his hands but he didn\xe2\x80\x99t and he escaped which is why there are those gouges in the walls: He created them. And chronologically, this makes sense, as Nic tries to talk with Jonah through the vent. But he can\xe2\x80\x99t because by this point, Jonah has already left the facility, he\xe2\x80\x99s escaped But this is perfect! With these obvious robot body parts, they can find the police or a news team and tell the world about the messed up experiments happening here! They can expose Area 51 and Damon and then they can go home free! But first they have to get out and there\xe2\x80\x99s only 1 way out and that\xe2\x80\x99s through a checkpoint. And it\xe2\x80\x99s there at the checkpoint the next day, where things go bad: They\xe2\x80\x99re stopped at the checkpoint and Jonah is asked to get out of the truck, but if he does that it\xe2\x80\x99ll reveal who they are He tries to drive away only for the car blockers to come up, stopping his wheels. There\xe2\x80\x99s no way out, so Jonah attacks a guard, taking his gun and runs into the guardpost where he tries using a laptop to hack the car stoppers. But he can\xe2\x80\x99t! His fingers too big and clunky. And that\xe2\x80\x99s when a grenade comes flying through the window and explodes, so as Jonah stumbles to the truck, his arms are glowing, but he ends up getting shot. He\xe2\x80\x99s dying, he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to make it and so his last actions before he dies is to SMASH the car stoppers with his hands and set Nic and Haley free. As Nic drives off, he leaves Jonah to his last moments: smashing the ground and sending the people around him flying! But there\xe2\x80\x99s one last roadblock: Damon with his crew of guards, snipers and cars. The guard\xe2\x80\x99s throw a spike strip that stops the truck. And as it flips over and crashes, Haley and Nic are left lying on the road, holding their hands, and Nic can do nothing but watch as Hailey is taken away in a helicopter. All he is left with, of Hayley, is Haley\xe2\x80\x99s necklace. He gets up, he\xe2\x80\x99s so close to escaping if he can just get past the guards! But Damon warns him that there\xe2\x80\x99s no way he\xe2\x80\x99s getting out alive. And Damon can\xe2\x80\x99t help but be pleased. Nic is \xe2\x80\x98their\xe2\x80\x99 greatest achievement: The Perfect Fusion of alien technology and human will That\xe2\x80\x99s when Nic has a realization: He stares at Damon\xe2\x80\x99s name tag. Damon. NOMAD. Damon is Nomad and with a furious yell, his legs light up and he blazes a trail past the barricade, past the gunman, screaming across the bridge, breaking the sound barrier, and straight through\xe2\x80\xa6 glass! And he finds himself in an industrial building and as he turns back, he sees Damon take off his helmet to reveal that he\xe2\x80\x99s actually a robot! And as the movie ends, we get a better view of where Nic is: inside Area 51, a giant floating spaceship going into an even larger spaceship in a galaxy far, far away from Earth So what just happened? Well, in case it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t clear: Nic, Haley, and Jonah were abducted by aliens. That desert that they were in was just an elaborate, life-sized simulation created by the aliens to keep tabs on their human test subjects. The simulation was meant to look and feel like Earth to keep the humans calm and to allow the aliens to conduct their tests. What are they testing? The ability of the humans to use the alien technology to it\xe2\x80\x99s fullest potential. Because the aliens are trying to find the perfect fusion of human will and alien technology. And we see how they test this by sending the characters into high stress situations where they are forced to use their new body parts: Like Jonah for example. Jonah\xe2\x80\x99s put into a room where he was supposed to kill a cow but he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t and then later, after he fails to hack a laptop he has no choice but to smash the concrete car stoppers with his hands and then he smashes ground in his last stand showing the awesome power of his hands. And like Jonah, Nic was also tested: when he was escaping, when he was chasing after the truck and of course at the end of the movie: where after he loses all his loved ones He runs across the bridge so fast, that he breaks the sound barrier. Showing us what the perfect fusion of alien technology and human will can do. So before I forget, let\xe2\x80\x99s talk about the other people in the simulation. They are just like Nic: they\xe2\x80\x99ve been abducted by the aliens except hey\xe2\x80\x99ve been kept in the spaceship for so long that they\xe2\x80\x99ve gone a bit crazy. And interestingly enough, Damon calls a few of them, like the truck driver and the old woman By their names, which implies that he\xe2\x80\x99s had some time to get to know them. And just to illustrate how long they\xe2\x80\x99ve been stuck in the spaceship (or at the least the truck driver). Now It\xe2\x80\x99s implied that the truck driver has been here since he was a child. And we know because of a few things: #1) It\xe2\x80\x99s how he acts, and #2) it\xe2\x80\x99s because he mentions a few things specifically his \xe2\x80\x98mommy\xe2\x80\x99 and his \xe2\x80\x98kitty\xe2\x80\x99. It\xe2\x80\x99s a very childish way of talking about your mom and your cat. Right? It\xe2\x80\x99s not conclusive. But it is a subtle hint that he was abducted as a child and he has grown up here in the simulation. With that being said, thank you so much for watching ladies and gentlemen gentlemen.
