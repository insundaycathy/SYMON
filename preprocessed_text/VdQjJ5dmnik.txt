Otis has a few hangups when it comes to sex, due to his single mother Jean being a very open and free-spirited sex therapist AND having witnessed his father cheat on his mother as a young boy. Otis\xe2\x80\x99 best friend is Eric, the gay son of a religious Ghanian-Nigerian family. Otis\xe2\x80\x99 crush is Maeve Wiley, an intelligent outcast whose rough family life leads to self-destructive tendencies. There\xe2\x80\x99s also Jackson Marchetti, the headboy at Moordale who struggles to just be a kid amidst the lofty expectations placed on him by his parents. Adam Groff is the headmaster\xe2\x80\x99s son who bullies the other students due to his own insecurities and the extreme pressures of his father. Aimee Gibbs is member of the popular mean girls clique \xe2\x80\x9cThe Untouchables\xe2\x80\x9d, but secretly she\xe2\x80\x99s best friends with Maeve and a people pleaser to the point of it being a detriment to herself. Other members of the Untouchables include Ruby, Olivia, and Anwar, the only other openly gay guy at Moordale, and the crush of Eric. And then there\xe2\x80\x99s Lily, an eccentric writer of alien erotica who desperately wants to lose her virginity. Throughout season 1, Otis develops a crush on Maeve and the two decide to start a sex therapy clinic to help the various sex and relationship problems of the students at Moordale. Otis is using knowledge he\xe2\x80\x99s picked up over the years from his sex therapist mother, while Maeve is running the business side of things, needing the money to help pay her rent as her parents and older brother are absent from her life. The clinic ends up becoming a huge success, and Otis helps many students along the way. He teaches Aimee to be her own person and to pursue and communicate her own thoughts and feelings instead of living for others. This eventually leads to Aimee breaking up with her Untouchables friend group and publicly siding with Maeve. She also breaks up with her bully of a boyfriend Adam and eventually ends up with nice guy Steve. He also helps Lily come to terms with both her obsession and internal anxieties over losing her virginity. But Otis\xe2\x80\x99 preoccupation with his new side hustle and his developing feelings for Maeve create tension in his relationship with best friend Eric. Throughout the season, Eric finds confidence and comfort in himself, reconnecting with his family\xe2\x80\x99s religious beliefs, realizing the love and support of his father, confidently displaying his true self to the school, and even striking up a relationship with the repressed bully Adam. That relationship is short-lived, as the perpetual screw-up Adam is shipped off to military school by his father. Jackson strikes up a relationship with Maeve, thanks in large part to some unwitting advice from Otis, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a huge breakthrough for Jackson in simply allowing himself to be a teenager. Instead of living his life revolved around swim meets and practices, he can party and experience young love. Unfortunately, try as she might, Maeve doesn\xe2\x80\x99t reciprocate those feelings and by the end of the season her and Jackson break up. Maeve spent the season trying to better herself and refocus on her academics. Her writing skills could earn her university scholarships, and an essay she wrote for Adam even ends up winning an award. But those newfound successes could all come grinding to a halt when her troublemaking brother returns home. After he\xe2\x80\x99s caught selling drugs at the school dance, Headmaster Groff believes that Maeve and Otis\xe2\x80\x99 clinic is actually a drug ring and moves to have Maeve expelled. Otis, meanwhile, is finally reckoning with his relationship with his mother.

Eric is still buzzing over his brief fling with Adam Groff, which was cut short after Adam was sent off to military school. A new French student named Rahim arrives at Moordale and the entire school takes an interest in him. But Rahim only has eyes for Eric and the two enter into a relationship. That relationship is complicated when Adam is kicked out of military school after drugs are planted in his bunk and he takes a job working at a shop under Rahim\xe2\x80\x99s apartment. Eric becomes caught between being in a comfortable relationship with Rahim that allows him to be confident and out in public, and exploring a relationship with Adam who is more repressed and closeted due to his father\xe2\x80\x99s oppressive rules. Aimee has now fully removed herself from the Untouchables clique and is now trying to discover herself and what her own aspirations are. Unfortunately, after being sexually assaulted on her bus to school, Aimee spends the season grappling with the trauma.

Although Jackson is at first angry at Viv for this decision, he starts going to therapy and finally confesses his true feelings to his mothers about the extreme pressure he feels they place on him when it comes to swimming. Jackson reconciles with his mothers and Viv. Otis\xe2\x80\x99 father Remi returns home to spend time with him. This excites Otis, but causes friction in Jean and Jakob\xe2\x80\x99s relationship. Jean isn\xe2\x80\x99t used to being in a committed and healthy relationship like she\xe2\x80\x99s in with Jakob, and begins to feel smothered by Jakob\xe2\x80\x99s intimacy. This eventually leads to Jean kissing Remi and ending her relationship with Jakob. Jean quickly realizes her mistake and her true love for Jakob, but he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe she\xe2\x80\x99s at a place to give him the intimacy he needs from a relationship. To complicate things further, Jean discovers that she\xe2\x80\x99s pregnant. And that\xe2\x80\x99s not the only discovery Jean will make, as she finally finds out about her son\xe2\x80\x99s secret sex clinic being run at Moordale, something she rightfully deems as completely unethical. And although Otis is at first excited to have his father back in his life, he soon discovers that Remi has only returned home because his new wife kicked him out for his incessant cheating. Ola begins to suspect that there\xe2\x80\x99s more going on between Otis and Maeve than just a friendship and their sex clinic business and asks Otis to cut Maeve from his life, which he does. Although Ola herself begins to realize that she\xe2\x80\x99s pansexual and has feelings for her friend Lily. Ola and Otis break up, and at a party, a drunken Otis manages to insult both Ola and Maeve. Ola and Lily begin a relationship, and Ola forms a friendship with her co-worker Adam. Maeve\xe2\x80\x99s mother, Erin, returns home with Maeve\xe2\x80\x99s young half-sister Elsie, with the promise of making amends with Maeve, getting clean, and getting a real job that can move them all out of the trailer park. At first hesitant to trust her mother, Maeve begins to trust that their relationship can be saved. Meanwhile, in addition to restarting the sex clinic with Otis, whom she secretly loves, Maeve also joins Moordale\xe2\x80\x99s trivia team, the Quiz Heads, alongside Steve, Viv, and Dex. Throughout the season, Maeve learns to trust in her teammates and eventually helps them win the national championship. That win is dampened when Maeve\xe2\x80\x99s new paraplegic neighbor Isaac discovers that Erin is using drugs again. Maeve makes the difficult decision to call social services on her mother, causing Erin and Elsie to be taken away by the authorities. Headmaster Groff\xe2\x80\x99s marriage with his wife Maureen deteriorates due to his complete lack of emotions and empathy. When Maureen begins to seek friendship and advice from Jean on the matter, a jealous and spiteful Groff begins copying and spreading Jean\xe2\x80\x99s therapy notes around Moordale, causing complete chaos. Everything comes to a head in the finale, set largely around the school\xe2\x80\x99s production of Romeo and Juliet. With the support of Viv and his mothers, Jackson is able to overcome his performance anxieties to play Romeo. The play\xe2\x80\x99s director, Lily, has crafted an impressively intricate, albeit sexually charged show. This embarrasses Headmaster Groff in front of the chair of the school board, and he tries to shut the production down. But it\xe2\x80\x99s actually his son Adam who fully derails the show by running on stage and publicly declaring his true feelings for Eric, who reciprocates. Headmaster Groff proceeds to have a bit of a public meltdown, accusing Jean of corrupting the students\xe2\x80\x99 minds. Otis stands up for his mother and the school board chair puts Groff on leave. As the season comes to a close, Otis is resolved to confess his true love to Maeve. When he goes to tell her, he instead finds Isaac.
