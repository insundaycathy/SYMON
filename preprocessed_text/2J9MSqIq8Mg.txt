Hey guys, today we will be watching the movie "The Tomorrow War". The movie starts with a scene in which we see some people falling down from the sky. Movie's protagonist Dan is one of those people he along with other people fall into a swimming pool of the high-rise building. When Dan comes out of there he has a gun in his hand and he seems ready for a war. From here we go 28 years back it's Dan's daughter's birthday and he has brought a lot of gifts for her. Dan's wife reminds him that his father had sent a letter for his granddaughter's birthday. Dan tells his wife that he doesn't need greetings from his father and that he should forget about his granddaughter as well. Dan is a biologist and he has a job as a teacher which he isn't very happy at. He is going for a job interview but before even he gets to leave his house he gets a rejection call. Dan becomes frustrated and angry because of the rejection he returns home and starts watching tv with his daughter. There's a football match going on suddenly a portal of some kind opens up in the middle of the football ground and out of that portal lot of men come out in combat uniform and Then their leader Lieutenant Hart makes her entrance. Lieutenant Hart starts explaining the situation she explains that they have come from the future and that there's a war going on in the future. She then reveals that they are here to recruit people to join them for the war due to the concerning threat to the entire human race and its existence the government decides to send the military from the present to fight the war in future. But the military from the present is unable to win the war so the government decides to send civilians as militants in the war of future. One day Dan is teaching to his class in the middle of which Dan receives a message which tells him to report his draft status for the war. After few experiments on him Dan is seemed eligible to participate in the war. When Dan asks why he is fit to go to the war the people in the lab reveal that he is going to die in seven years. So by logic his participation in the war isn't going to change his and his family's lives by much. Hearing this Dan is confused and before he can even comprehend what's going on a device is fitted on his arm. The device allows Dan to jump to and from the future war they also reveal that if Dan removes that device from his arm they will put him in prison and his family member will have to take his place in the war. Dan now tells his wife about the whole thing. Being worried she suggests that they should run away from the government. Dan says that they cannot run away from the government but his wife asks him to go to his father who can help him. Dan at first refuses this idea but his wife asks him to do this for their daughter. Now Dan goes to his father his father tells him that he can remove that device but later it turns out that Dan's father doesn't believe him and thinks that Dan is here to help the cops arrest him. After this they have an argument. Tt is then revealed that when Dan was a child his father had left him and his mother. Dan's father tries to explain why he did that but Dan refuses to believe him and leaves without removing the device from his arm. He goes to his wife and says that there is no solution if I am chosen I have to go to the war. Dan's wife becomes sad after hearing this she says that if he has accepted this decision she cannot stop him. And now goes to his daughter he tells her that he will be leaving for an urgent piece of work and that he will be gone for a week. Dan's daughter understands that he will be leaving for war she gets sad but Dan assures her that he will be back. Dan now leaves after saying goodbye to his daughter. In the next scene we see Dan with many others reach the research center they're all handed out weapons and are briefed that they will be at war for a total of seven days. And if they are able to survive those seven days they will be brought back to the present time. At the center, Dan meets Charlie and few other people. Charlie tells Dan that the person in red shirt is called Dorian. It is Dorian's third time going to war in the future. It is also revealed that the thing over Dorian's neck is the claw of a White Spike which is the thing that the human race is at war against. In a separate briefing for the first timers, one woman asks an interesting question. she asks that if we have a time machine then why don't we go to the time just before the war started and not let it begin. Then a young man explains that they can only jump to and from time at a range of 30 years which is between 2021 and 2051. Here it is revealed that the thing they are going at war against are aliens called White Spikes and that they rest every six days which is when the people from present will go out and fight while the aliens rest. In the next scene Dan is talking with Charlie then suddenly alarm starts going off a research center in the future is under attack by the White Spikes so they need to go right now to stop it or else everything the human race knows about the aliens will get lost in that research center they all line up and the portal opens up above them slowly everyone gets sucked by the portal and the controller of the portal senses something wrong but it's too late and most of them are already gone to the future now we go back to the scene which started the movie due to the mistake in the time machine many of them land to their death Dan however with few others are lucky to land in the swimming pool the remaining people group up and the view of the future totally shocks them it's total chaos and the city of miami is in total ruins Dan gets in communication with the people in the present time due to Dan's experience in military he is told to assemble everyone and rescue a team from a building which is surrounded by the White Spikes Dan gets everyone together and heads to the building the building seems to already have been attacked by the White Spikes Dan and his team find the research team dead Dan tells this to the colonel who commands them to collect few data and samples from the lab and head out of there immediately they all collect the necessary hard drives and data from the lab the colonel commands the bomb squad to drop bomb on the city so Dan and his team have to get out of there quickly White Spikes are surrounding the building so Dan and his team decide to take the stairway it's really quite here they're all cautious of their surrounding Dan hears a soft growling he tells everyone to stay silent he looks down the stairway but there's nothing down there so they all slowly go down the stairway then one of the team members notices something moving in the upper floors he calls out everyone to notice it Dan points his flashlight to the thing and then we see what the White Spikes really look like the White Spike shoots a spike from his body that instantly takes out one of Dan's team members now everyone starts shooting at the White Spike the attack provokes all the White Spikes and they take down few of the humans Dan and Charlie try to fight off one of the White Spike they shoot at it intensely but it doesn't die Dan tells everyone to run while he attempts to hold one of the White Spike that is after them Dan keeps shooting but the White Spike isn't hurt and charges towards Dan realizing that bullet isn't causing any harm to it Dan takes out the axe from the building and manages to hit it on the White Spikes head but it still doesn't die Dorian then comes back and shoots the White Spike on the neck which finally kills it Dorian explains that to kill it humans need to shoot it on its neck or bellies that is the only way to kill them Dan and his team are finally outside the building and they get back up from few tanks they're all happy to see the backup but it doesn't last long as White Spikes take down the tanks as well they have no option but to charge forward as the bombing squad starts dropping bombs on the city while running away from the bombs one of the team members falls down a rail and breaks his legs Dorian wants to leave him and go to safety but Dan wants to save the guy and so he and the team jumps down as well but it's too late to save him as the White Spikes are all over there one woman from the team tells Dan to leave as she has been shot they try to fight off the White Spikes and get enough time for others to escape the bombs drop in at the same time killing the White Spikes in a matter of seconds the whole city is bombed down Dan Charlie and Dorian are the only ones that manage to survive they are at a new base and are safe for now Dan asks Dorian on why he is at the war for the third time Dorian answers that he has cancer and rather than dying a slow death he prefers to die in his own terms then an officer comes to them and says the Charlie and Dorian are to redeploy against the White Spikes as for Dan he was asked to see by the colonel anne meets the colonel who thanks him for bringing back the samples from the research lab Dan then gets to know that the colonel has the same last name forester as him Dan asks her where she's from colonel replies that she is from the same place as himself Dan gets silent and realizes that she is his daughter miri Dan tries to get close to her but murray stops him Dan says that he will respect her rank as a colonel and not referred to as his daughter Murie tells Dan that due to the lack of manpower she's not only a colonel but also acts as the lead researcher Dan seems very proud of her Murie explains that she didn't bring him here to spend time with him she brought him there because he has to do something to save the human race Dan asks her the reason but murray says that he will know in time murray now tells Dan about the female White Spikes she tells him that the females are much stronger and aggressive than the males the female White Spikes nest underground and reproduce at a massive rate while the males protect them Muri further explains that they had found out a way to kill the males but the females were different she tells him that they plan to capture a female White Spike and do tests on her to find out a way to kill the females to stop the reproduction of the whole species of White Spikes the team heads out to catch the female White Spike on their way Dan asks murray what happened in the future between him and his family murray refuses to tell him anything but she seems sad about it they reach the nesting ground of the female White Spikes a few people are pulling the chains tied to the female White Spike who is inside the cave the female finally gets outside and starts attacking everyone they are failing to capture the female Murie decides to go down to help her team Dan wants to go with her but she commands him to stay there as he is important to her plans murray goes down and shoots off a tentacle of the female which gets it really angry the White Spike attacks murray while the others try to pull it inside the cage meanwhile Dan notices a storm of male White Spikes who are on their way to save the female he sees one male coming towards the cave so he goes down and kills it Dan goes down into the cave and helps murray and her team to finally get the female White Spike into the cage after fighting off the White Spikes with a tank Dan and murray managed to escape from there they reach a beach and wait for the rescue team to take them from there while waiting Dan and murray talk about what happened after Dan had returned from the war Murie reveals that after Dan returned from the war he was a completely different person he left Murie and her mother to be all alone by themselves when yuri needed him the most he wasn't there for her because of this Murie was sad all her life and didn't seem too happy to see Dan come back from the past Dan and miri now reach the new facility they have the female White Spike with them the White Spike is put to sleep with heavy doses of sedatives all that is left to do is to study the female White Spike's body and find what is stopping the toxins to kill it Dan and murray know that if they are able to detect a female White Spike's defense against a toxin they can create something that will neutralize the White Spikes defense and subsequently kill all of the species they're on multiple tests but they cannot find anything that will help them Muri starts getting frustrated with the amount of failed tests Dan wants to help her and asks how he is going to help her in this war against the White Spikes murray then reveals her plan on how to save the entire human race Murie tells Dan that there is no way they can kill all the White Spikes in the current time they're in so when the toxin is ready miri wants Dan to take it with him in the past after which Dan is to mass produce the toxin and use it to kill all the White Spikes when they attack earth just then the computer reads that the formula of the toxin to kill the female White Spikes has been found they finally have the weapon to kill all the White Spikes but they don't get to enjoy the moment for too long the female White Spike is awake and the males have also reached the facility to save the female Dan and murray leave the research lab and head towards the helipad thousands of White Spikes are attacking the last remaining numbers of humans the male White Spikes finally help the female out of the chains and she is angry fear is only six minutes left until Dan will jump back in time nuri has to protect him until then murray and Dan try to reach the top but the White Spikes are also in search of them while almost reaching the helipad murray is attacked by a White Spike and is thrown down Dan goes down to help her he supports her and tries to get her away from there the whole facility is overwhelmed by the number of White Spikes it really seems that it is the end of the world Dan tells murray that they have to keep moving but miri is in no shape to move at all he finally realizes that she was heavily injured by the attack of the White Spike they both realize that she is going to die Dan doesn't want to leave her but miri hands him the toxin and tells him that he has to leave her in order to save the world just then the female White Spike appears in front of them and the structure that they're on also breaks down murray folds down with it but Dan manages to hold her hand he tries to hold her with all his power but murray's hands slip and she starts falling down Dan throws himself off as well to save Murie but the time device on his arm takes him back to his time and with other survivors reach the current timeline Dan screams in pain and medical staffs rush in to help everyone injured Dan finally wakes up explains that they have to mass produce this toxin and go to the future to save murray and others Lieutenant hart tells Dan that the time jump link has been broken and now there's no way they can go to the future Dan gets discharged and meets his wife who is waiting for him Dan gets welcomed by murray at home he gets emotional after seeing his daughter alive and hugs her tight that night Dan and his wife talk about when the White Spikes could attack earth there's no record on when the White Spikes attack earth so they don't know when they should be ready for it his wife then suggests the idea that what if they're already here on earth and they only attack the humans in the future the idea seems interesting to Dan so he goes to Dorian and manages to get his help Dan with the help of Charlie finds out that the White Spikes had a volcanic ash in their claws but Dan is confused how the chinese volcanic ash is found in the White Spike's claws who first attacked on russia Dan now tries to get the help of this school student who seems to be an expert in ancient volcanoes this part is really silly I mean why does he have to go to a school student to get information on volcanoes when he could have just gone to someone with more knowledge and expertise this part of the movie was really unnecessary and silly to me however the clever student tells Dan that the ancient chinese volcanic eruption had spread its ash up to the russian glaciers which could be where they might find the White Spikes in hiding Dan now knows where to find the White Spikes so he goes to the person in charge of all this and asks for help which gets declined Dan now has no option but to go to his dad his father is a pilot and has a plane to help them in this mission Lieutenant hart and few others join Dan on the mission they all head out to the glacier island to find and kill the White Spikes after reaching the glacier island the team blasts a magnetic area and find a cave that leads them to the White Spikes aircraft they enter the aircraft and find the White Spikes in hibernation anne and his team inject the White Spikes with the toxins which seems to work as the White Spikes get killed however the ones behind them start waking up Dan hurries to inject one of them but is thrown away by its powers all the White Spikes are now out of their hibernation Dorian says that they have no time and they need to blow the entire aircraft he then hands Dan the White Spike's teeth which again seems pointless but it will serve a purpose later on Lieutenant Hart finds more White Spikes in the ship and she tries to hold them off Dorian then presses the bomb which blasts the entire ship Dan barely manages to survive the blast Dan's father tells him that the female was the only one which had managed to escape Dan realizes that if they don't kill the female there will be no point of this mission Dan and his father head off in search of the female White Spike they finally see the female who charges forward to attack Dan's father Dan tells him to move away but the White Spike gets a hold of him and attacks him however it turns out that it was just a decoy and Dan's father was in hiding who shoots the White Spike on its head which surely doesn't kill it the father and son duo both shoot at the White Spike in order to kill it after an intense fight Dan manages to inject the toxin on the White Spike's hand it finally seems that the female White Spike will die but to everyone's surprise it bites off his hand and is healthy as ever again the female walks towards Dan who is just right at the edge of a cliff Dan's father cuts his hand to attract a White Spike away from Dan he apologizes to Dan for not being there for him and is ready to sacrifice his life to save Dan the White Spike charges to attack him but just then Dan manages to climb onto the White Spike and cuts its throat with the same thing that Dorian gave him minutes earlier Dan then manages to get the last vial of toxin he has with him and throws it inside the White Spike's mouth Dan then lands a final kick to the White Spike which falls off the cliff to its death and now the whole human race is saved Dan returns back to his wife and daughter and this time he has brought his father with him Dan's father finally gets to meet his granddaughter Dan and his wife share a kiss and the movie ends overall a good movie a sick plot with a decent storytelling and a superb visual effects I was really impressed by the effects with which they brought the White Spikes to life in the movie however I really could have gone without the school kid explaining volcanoes what do you guys think did you guys enjoy the movie comment down below and subscribe to never miss out on our video
