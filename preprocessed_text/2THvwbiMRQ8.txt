Welcome to Game Of Thrones season 2 \xe2\x80\x93 Crammed! Thanks for all the comments on season 1, I hope you\xe2\x80\x99ve given it a watch because we\xe2\x80\x99re gonna dive right in! We begin with the hound beating the shit out of somebody for the entertainment of king Joffrey on his nameday, but up next is a drunk knight called Ser Dontos who Joff is gonna have murdered gluttony style for turning up late. However Sansa pleads for his life and Sandor subtly backs her play. Tyrion is in town back from the war and pleased to see his family - and Joffrey, and it looks like he\xe2\x80\x99s gonna instil some order. Sansa plays the perfect hostage and Tyrion meets with Cersei and the small council to act as hand. Cersei isn\xe2\x80\x99t happy to see him which is great, and Tyrion gives her stick for loosing Ned and Arya thanks to poor management. And the fact she has no control over this creep. T-Dog is settling in Ned\xe2\x80\x99s old tower of the hand with his secret whore Shae while Littlefinger and Cersei rub each other the wrong way. Up at Winterfell the old lords test Bran to see how easily he\xe2\x80\x99ll roll over, but with Maester Luwin\xe2\x80\x99s advice he\xe2\x80\x99s doing ok looking after the place with Robb in the field. He starts to have dreams where he is in the body of his Direwolf Summer, and spies a red comet in the sky. Osha their wildling housepet says the comet means different things to different people, but claims it\xe2\x80\x99s truth is the coming of dragons. Speaking of which Dany and her ragtag leftover khalasar are marching through the red wastes. They\xe2\x80\x99re sore and tired with the horses dying of starvation - but they must cross because all other directions hold danger and those that would kill them and steal the hatchling dragons. She sends her bloodriders off to scout the land in all directions for signs of hope, and follows the route of comet herself. Her story is gonna be pretty thin this season. North of the wall the Night\xe2\x80\x99s Watch stop at Craster\xe2\x80\x99s keep, Craster being a wildling who is friendly-ish to the Watch and has a habit of marrying his own daughters to gain more daughters. Jon and Sam wonder what happens to his sons but in the hall Mormont is seeking information as to why all the wildling villages have been abandoned. Turns out they have all gone north to join the King-Beyond the Wall, Mance Rayder, an ex-brother of the Watch, who is gathering a huge army. And despite being hidden far away over at Dragonstone during season one, we finally see what Stannis, dead king Robert\xe2\x80\x99s older and less fun brother is up to. Turns out he\xe2\x80\x99s spending all of his time in the company of the Red woman Melisandre, a priestess of the Lord of light who has a massive boner for burning things and religiously converting everyone in a bid to help Stannis claim the throne. This new religion is upsetting a lot of the oldschoolers however, so whilst we get a flavour for how just and stubborn and humourless Stannis is, their Maester tries a suicide poision wine attack on Melisandre, but her magic appears to be too strong. Don\xe2\x80\x99t forget the North is at war with the South, So King Robb checks in on his captive Jamie Lannister to give him some wolf heebie-jeebies, and tells him that Stannis is sending ravens to everyone saying he\xe2\x80\x99s the next king in line because Joffrey and co. are just incest babies between Jaime and the Queen. Robb sends terms to the Lannisters about staying out of the North forever and Theon who\xe2\x80\x99s the son of Balon Greyjoy of the Iron Islands suggests he go back home to convince the Krakens to lend their ships to Robb\xe2\x80\x99s war. Catelyn thinks that letting Theon go is a terrible idea, but her job is to go South and meet with Renly, dead King Robert\xe2\x80\x99s other brother who tried to warn Ned back in the day and see if he wants an alliance with the Starks, because like Stannis, he\xe2\x80\x99s also claiming the throne for himself as king, despite being the younger (but more popular) brother. And to wrap things up for the Day Joffrey has the gold cloaks go around killing all of king Robert\xe2\x80\x99s bastard children, including babies! So that nobody can compare their Baratheon bloodline features to that of the golden children. Good thing Gendry has been sent off with Arya then amongst the recruits for the Night\xe2\x80\x99s Watch! In fact whilst Arya is pretending to be a boy and annoying the worst of the criminals form the dark dungeons, including this mysterious polite person, Goldcloaks rush up to claim back Gendry, although Arry assumes it\xe2\x80\x99s for her, but Yoren ain\xe2\x80\x99t taking no shit as this ragtag group now belongs to the Watch. Most of who by the way are still loitering at Craster\xe2\x80\x99s Keep. With the rumours of Craster sacrificing his sons, Jon follows the man during the dead of night and glimpses what looks to be one of the Others taking the baby as sacrifice \xe2\x80\x93 Oop! Watch out! Ah too late. Craster is pissed off at Jon for snooping around and despite the fact that he\xe2\x80\x99s sacrificing babies, Mormont decides is just time to move on (finally). And although Sam wants to take Gilly, one of his pregnant daughters with them, they\xe2\x80\x99re marching North, the wrong way. Back down in King\xe2\x80\x99s Landing Varys visits Shae and Tyrion to basically drive the point home that there are no secrets kept from him, and explains that it\xe2\x80\x99s important to have friends that can be trusted. While in the city\xe2\x80\x99s weird brothels where - ugh gross! Oh no mate! - some of the whores are feeling sad that a baby was killed here the other day. But Littlefinger makes it clear he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care for sad girls that can\xe2\x80\x99t make him money. On the topic however Tyrion invites Janos Slynt up to dinner, the leader of the Goldcloaks who turned on Ned Stark\xe2\x80\x99s men in the throne room last season and further went round killing all the bastard children earlier. You see Tyrion doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like scumbags, so Slynt is gonna be joining the Night\xe2\x80\x99s Watch whether he wants to or not. And now Bronn is charge of the Goldcloaks! Not that he\xe2\x80\x99s a particularly good person either, just on Tyrion\xe2\x80\x99s payroll. Oh and despite being terrible Cersei actually thinks she\xe2\x80\x99s the only one round here keeping things together! And she further tells Tyrion that he murdered their mother, who died whilst giving birth to him, which is just really harsh. Theon Greyjoy sails home for the Iron islands to help Robb win his father over to the war, and he\xe2\x80\x99s all excited about being an important Prince returned home. He talks bit about their culture of raping and pillage and salt wives and - Oh bloody hell mate. But once he\xe2\x80\x99s there nobody seems to care that much and no one is out to greet him. Until this cheeky girl offers to escort him up to the castle on her horse like some kind of Uber. Theon spends the ride trying to get friendly and going on about how awesome he is like a real mouthy prick, but once he gets to the Castle his Father thinks Theon has grown to be a soft boy of Winterfell and the Starks. He\xe2\x80\x99s forgotten that these hard bastards don\xe2\x80\x99t buy pretty clothes, but claim stuff for their own. In fact Balons planning on claiming a crown for his own too (seeing as everyone else is doing it) by attacking the North. Basically Theon grew up with the Starks as a ward because the Iron Islands rose up in rebellion a while back which was crushed accordingly. So Balon isn\xe2\x80\x99t too happy about that, oh yeah and that cheeky bird is actually Theon\xe2\x80\x99s sister Yara, who is more of a Kraken than he is \xe2\x80\x93 awkward! Down on Dragonstone The faithful Onion Knight Ser Davos convinces an old pirate captain friend of his Salladhor Saan to lend his fleet to King Stannis\xe2\x80\x99 cause in return for the plunder of King\xe2\x80\x99s Landing when he takes the throne. Davos Seaworth used to be smuggler in the day but he\xe2\x80\x99s basically just a real honest and simple loyal guy now in support of his King. But he\xe2\x80\x99s not taken on the new red faith of Melisandre quite like the others have. Stannis likes the fleet, but he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have enough strength to beat his younger brother Renly in the field. Melisandre suggest that he give himself to her directly so that she can bear him some kind of son (Despite him having a wife). So of course they have sex, because if you\xe2\x80\x99re not killing somebody in this show, you\xe2\x80\x99re banging them. Bran\xe2\x80\x99s wolf dreams become stronger, often running in the woods in the body of Summer. Maester Luwin is more a science guy however and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe in such forces, although he does admit that long ago there were such things as dragons and magic and the children of the forest. Catelyn travels down to meet Renly and his host, who are taking things easy and having a melee. Looks like Loras is beaten by a woman called Brienne of Tarth, who joins Renly\xe2\x80\x99s Kingsguard as her prize. Meanwhile Renly promises to bring Joffrey\xe2\x80\x99s head to Cat when he takes King\xe2\x80\x99s landing, despite a little bit of my King versus your King friction. Renly is well loved but not as much as he loves Loras, despite being married to his sister, Queen Margery. She doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really mind but if they don\xe2\x80\x99t get down and have a baby soon there\xe2\x80\x99s gonna be a problem. Over on Pyke Balon Greyjoy plots to pillage the North with his ships while Robb heads South. Theon gets a hard time from his dad and sister for being a weak Starkling at heart and is eager to prove himself. Now he does almost send a letter to Robb as warning but decides to follow the dark side and be a Kraken instead. So he joins the faith of their drowned God \xe2\x80\x93 and nobody\xe2\x80\x99s impressed. In order to keep her secret Tyrion has to set Shae up as being a scullery maid, which she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like at all, and over a Royal dinner Sansa tries not to cry her eyes out at the prospect of having to marry Joffrey. Well Shae is her new handmaid now, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that\xe2\x80\x99s all gonna be fine. Tyrion tells grand Maester Pycelle of a secret plan about marrying off Princess Marcella, and he also tells this to Varys and Littlefinger, but each time a different version, all as a cunning trick to discovering who\xe2\x80\x99s informing on him to the queen. Spoiler alert its Pycelle. Cersei and Littlefinger are pissed off at being tricked, whilst Varys congratulates the power play before Tyrion pops in on Pycelle and has his beard cut off before throwing him in a black cell. On their way North Yoren Tells Arya about holding grudges and dealing with trauma, just before the Goldcloacks return to attack the group with the help of Tywin\xe2\x80\x99s man, ser Armory Lorch. Yoren is a badass who despite a crossbow bolt takes down a handful of men, but he was only one against many and now it\xe2\x80\x99s time to fight and run. Fire spreads in the confusion, and Arya gives an axe to the guys from the black cells to escape with. However the kids are captured and Needle is stolen by this asshole who casually kills another boy. But Arya smartly claims he was Gendry, the boy they were after anyway, basically saving this guy\xe2\x80\x99s life. The Stark armies are still smashing the Lannisters, and after another win he takes a shine to this Volantis girl while she saws off a guy\xe2\x80\x99s leg. Romantic. She plays hard to get and Robb likes it. Oh God back to Joffrey again, because his armies are losing he has Sansa punished and beaten by his Kingsguard at court. But before she\xe2\x80\x99s fully stripped Tyrion steps up and remind Joff what happened to the last Mad King when he kept doing whatever cruel things he wanted. Ser Meryn doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like people talking back to the King, but Bronn is here and Bronn can kill him. And Tyrion is impressed at Sansa\xe2\x80\x99s resolve at playing the good hostage despite everything. So he gets Joffrey some whores for his birthday in the hope that getting laid might chill him out a bit, but instead he has one beat the other horribly at crossbow point, because he\xe2\x80\x99s just that kind of king. Cersei\xe2\x80\x99s cousin Lancel tries giving Tyrion a hard time on her behalf for imprisoning Pycelle. But he\xe2\x80\x99s a dumb idiot and Tyrion gets him to admit that Cerseis been banging him too. So now worried for his life Tyrion gets Lancel to continue keeping her happy between the sheets as long as he informs on her for him. Littlefinger visits King Renly as he marches to meet his brother Stannis in a manner that hints at scheming but leads nowhere, because he really wants to meet with Catelyn, who\xe2\x80\x99s really unhappy to see him since the whole betraying her husband thing. He lies and says that both her daughters are captive at King\xe2\x80\x99s Landing and suggests that she swap them out for Jamie Lannister, then he returns Ned\xe2\x80\x99s bones courtesy of Tyrion. In reality Arya and the other captive boys are taken to Harrenhall as prisoners. This castle has a cursed history and it\xe2\x80\x99s currently being run by the Mountain, who picks a new person to be tortured to death every day. After a horrible few nights it\xe2\x80\x99s eventually Gendry\xe2\x80\x99s turn, but just in time Lord Tywin Lannister arrives to make this his war H.Q. and has the prisoners put to use around the place instead of being just tortured. He clocks that Arry is in fact a girl and makes her his new cupbearer. And reaching the edge of the Red Wastes one of Dany\xe2\x80\x99s riders report they have discovered the city of Qarth, which might be their only hope. So they all head over but there\xe2\x80\x99s a bit of a culture clash at the gates and they risk being barred entry and left to die. However one of them called Xaro Xhoan Daxos vouches for her out of dragon curiosity and things are finally starting to look up. Stannis treats with his brother Renly - One is the older and more rightful king, the other better loved with the larger army \xe2\x80\x93 But Catelyn doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have time for squabbling and tries to remind them all of the common enemy, the Lannisters. No good comes of the meeting however and the threat of battle between their two armies looms for the next day. That night however Stannis gets Ser Davos to pick up his former smuggling skills and sneak the Red Priestess into a cove near Renly\xe2\x80\x99s location. If he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t unnerved by her freaky sorcery before then he sure now. Because Melisandre gives birth to a living black shadow that takes dark form. Meanwhile Renly and Catelyn seem to reach a late night accord, agreeing on a Stark &amp; Baratheon alliance. But in sweeps the shadow with the face of Stannis and it Kills Renly before disappearing. Some of the guards think Brienne must have done it, and Catelyn escapes with her before people get rash. Brienne sees a woman\xe2\x80\x99s courage in Catelyn and enters into her service, so long as she\xe2\x80\x99s allowed to kill Stannis in revenge. So with Renly now dead Littlefinger schemes with his former Queen before Stannis arrives to take charge of his army. Davos tries to tell Stannis of the creepy shit he saw the other night. But for some reason the King will not hear of it. Though does concede to leave Melisandre at home when he attacks King\xe2\x80\x99s Landing. In the capitol Cersei drinks to the death of Renley (she\xe2\x80\x99s been drinking a lot lately) and Tyrion discovers that she\xe2\x80\x99s planning on using wildfire to defend the city, a highly volatile and dangerous kind of green napalm that the alchemists are brewing up for her. So Tyrion visits the alchemists himself to discover huge underground vaults of the stuff and takes over the operation instead. Theon gets mocked by his new crew and hatches a plan to actually make a sneak attack on Winterfell, a grand prize that will hopefully make the Ironborn respect him. Despite having been raised there. He attacks a town, 40 leagues from the castle, and Bran in response has Ser Rodrik Cassel take two hundred men over to defend it, leaving Winterfell essentially unguarded. It\xe2\x80\x99s then that Bran tells Osha he dreamed of the sea coming up and washing all over the castle. At Harrenhall Tywin is unaware that his cupbearer is actually Arya Stark and she discovers that one of the prisoners they were travelling with has somehow embedded himself as a Lannister solider. Because Arya saved his life and the two chained up with him, this strange guy offers to kill three people for her in return. So first off the top of her head is the Tickler who was torturing people earlier, and boom falls and breaks his neck. The Knight\xe2\x80\x99s Watch make it up to the fist of the first men, an ancient place where they set up camp and meet with more black brothers from the shadow tower, led by Qhorin Halfhand, a tough gnarled ranger who plans to sneak over to the wildling army and kill the king beyond the wall before they organise an attack South. Jon volunteers to join them and a small team of five head out. In the City of Qarth Dany and her crew are treated as honoured guests of high society, and she is further welcomed on behalf of the warlocks by creepy Pyat Pree who advises her to come visit them at the house of the undying sometime. This party is full of odd strangers, as a masked woman warns Jorah to stay by Dany\xe2\x80\x99s side and guard her against those that would take her dragons. Xaro offers to marry Dany, and with Westeros split, half of his wealth could buy ships and an army for her although he\xe2\x80\x99ll want a Dragon in return, and it becomes clear that Ser Jorah is in love with her while she mulls things over. Dany tries to get ships independently from the rest of the 13, but fails. 06 Theon has led a sneak attack and claimed Winterfell, and Bran is just like: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy I thought you lived here!?\xe2\x80\x9d He convinces Bran to yield the castle, but everybody calls him a scumbag to his face, and in order to look tough he has to Kill Ser Rodrik for spitting on him. He even manages to make a pig\xe2\x80\x99s ear of that. - Aww god I hate you! Jon and the Shadow Tower men are out to kill some wildling scouts before they raise the alarm on the rest of the Watch. They sneak up for the kill but Jon catches a girl, and they question her but she\xe2\x80\x99s fearless. Jon is left to finisher her off but he hesitates and she escapes for a bit before he then takes her as a prisoner. And then they cuddle up in the cold while she\xe2\x80\x99s tied up, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t really know what Jon thinks is happening right now. Princess Marcella is being shipped off South to Dorne as part of an alliance, and Cersei tells Tyrion she will take away someone he loves for this - Lovely! On the way back from the docs however the crowd turns nasty on the royal party, so Joff wants them killed and a full on riot kicks off! The fat Septon is torn apart, and after the Goldcloaks rush out Joffrey, Tyron gives him another good slap for being such a stupid piece of shit. Sansa is almost raped but saved by the Hound who returns her to the Keep. At Harrenhall Arya crosses paths with Ser Amoury Lorch, so she puts in a panic-request with Jaqen H'ghar (her mysterious murder friend) who gets to Lorch just before he gets to Tywin. And Littlefinger (who seems to be travelling everywhere) visits Tywin to suggest a Tyrell alliance, by basically having Margery marry Joff instead of Sansa. Robb and that girl he likes flirt some more at the camp but his mum is back for the cock-block and reminds him he\xe2\x80\x99s betrothed to a Frey. Roose Bolton delivers the bad news however about Theon taking Winterfell, but Robb can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to march back home during the war, so Roose offers to send word to his bastard son Ramsay to go kick Theon out. Seeing as Osha was part captive during the good times, Theon decides to free her after she takes off her clothes! But after some bed-fun she helps Bran, Rickon and Hodor escape with the wolves. Meanwhile Dany\xe2\x80\x99s not really getting anything done in Qarth until her dragons are stolen and someone and some of her Dothraki killed. Where are my dragons? So Theon\xe2\x80\x99s angry that the boys escaped and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like to be reminded he was duped by Osha like a mug. They hunt after the Starks with Maester Luwin who\xe2\x80\x99s not happy to be there, but the boys can\xe2\x80\x99t be found. So in order to look like he\xe2\x80\x99s a badass and not actually a looser he kills two random farm boys and burns the bodies to claim they\xe2\x80\x99re Starks! Jon wakes up slightly regretting the creepy-sleepy with his Wildling captive and she chides him for being a Crow that\xe2\x80\x99s never had sex. See the Wildling ideology is all about freedom and not being bound by other people\xe2\x80\x99s rules which doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work with Jon\xe2\x80\x99s outlook. It\xe2\x80\x99s Gypsies versus Houses all over again. Anyway this girl is called Ygritte, and she tries to convince Jon to join them and be free, maybe even take her for his woman. See Jon\xe2\x80\x99s basically lost and he can\xe2\x80\x99t find the other brothers he headed out with before \xe2\x80\x93 Oh no! Now he\xe2\x80\x99s the captive! Up in the ruined castle of Harrenhall Tywin tells Arya the importance of dragons and legacy over some dinner because there like mates now or something? Even though he still thinks she\xe2\x80\x99s just a cupbearer. Sansa thanks the Hound for saving her life but he spits it back in her face, Clegane is angry at a world full of hypocrisy, and he then discovers that Sansa has flowered, which unfortunately for her means its soon time to marry Joffrey, and Cersei doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even try to pretend that it\xe2\x80\x99s gonna anything but miserable for her. She even chills out with Tyrion later and admits her son is a cruel monster. Over at Robb\xe2\x80\x99s Northern army the sexy samaritan is almost luring the King of the North out of his pants by now, while captive Jamie reminisces with one of his distant cousins who\xe2\x80\x99s another Lannister hostage, before he kills the lad to lure in the guard in and make his escape. That\xe2\x80\x99s Dark! And short-lived \xe2\x80\x93 Now the dead guard\xe2\x80\x99s father who is the Lord of house Karstark wants Jaime\xe2\x80\x99s head in revenge and that\xe2\x80\x99s causing some serious friction - Jaime\xe2\x80\x99s real plan all along. In order to avoid mutiny and the loss of such a precious hostage, Catelyn send Jaime away with Brienne to hopefully get exchanged for Sansa and Arya. Robb and Lord Karstark are furious at her and send men in pursuit. Dany beseeches the 13 of Qarth for help with finding her dragons, but it turns out the creepy warlocks took them with the help of Xaro Xhoan Daxos, who\xe2\x80\x99s been plotting to make himself a King! Those pesky warlocks are everywhere so Dany does nothing for a bit in order to pad out her story arc. Theon\xe2\x80\x99s sister Yara rides to Winterfell to tell him he\xe2\x80\x99s weak and stupid for killing the boys. Theon thought she was bringing reinforcements to hold the castle, but she\xe2\x80\x99s here to convince him to do something smart for once and leave back for the Iron islands. He\xe2\x80\x99s going to stay however. The Wildlings take captive Jon to the Lord of bones (don\xe2\x80\x99t know where he gets the name from), who has killed the other Black Brothers and captured Qhorin Halfhand whilst they were away. They\xe2\x80\x99re being marched North to see the King beyond the wall when Qhorin tells Jon to go over to their side if they\xe2\x80\x99ll have him and learn all he can about them. Making it look like he hates Jon as a traitor in order to convince the others. The rest of the Castle Black crewe are still at the Fist of the first men, while Sam and friends discover an old cache full of Dragonglass blades and arrows. On the road Jaime and Brienne sneak themselves a boat, and although Jaime tries to anger her into doing something stupid, she\xe2\x80\x99s too stubborn to be goaded by her captive. Tywin Lannister is on the move with his army, and Arya is gonna be left with the Mountain\xe2\x80\x99s awful garrison at Harrenhall. She realises she\xe2\x80\x99s been an idiot for not having Jaqen H'ghar kill Twyin all this time and now she can\xe2\x80\x99t find him! And when he does finally show up from patrol she tricks him into promising to kill himself, unless he now helps her escape with Gendry and this other kid, Hot Pie. So that night they simply walk out of the gates, all the guards on duty assassinated by different means. Tyrion is planning the defence of the capitol and Cersei tells him that she has his whore who\xe2\x80\x99ll be killed if Joffrey ends up dying in the battle. She actually has the wrong girl however so Tyrion plays along and tells Cersei that he will one day see her joy turned to ashes. He then goes off bang Shae, but Tyrion seems to have forgotten that this is was an arrangement and has unfortunately fallen in love. Oh dear. In fact while on the topic Robb has fallen in love with the girl from Volantis, Talisa. After hearing her life story and seeing her kind heart he betrays his betrothal to the Freys - by banging her right in the war tent! At sea, we discover that Ser Davos the Onion Knight earned his title when he smuggled food to Stannis at Storm\xe2\x80\x99s End in the middle of a siege, and this simple crabber\xe2\x80\x99s son has grown to be his right hand man for his constant loyal and honest council. And now in the dark of night Stannis sails toward King\xe2\x80\x99s landing with Salladhor Saan\xe2\x80\x99s fleet. While preparing to defend the city, Bronn and the Hound size each other up as to who\xe2\x80\x99s the better killer before being interrupted by the invading army. As Tyrion readies for battle Varys confides in him that he believes in and despises magic and the dark artsclaiming Stannis must never sit the throne. Tyrion has a plan involving the wildfire operation, and Joffrey makes Sansa kiss his new sword before he defends the city. But she gets the odd cheeky word in now that she\xe2\x80\x99s growing tired of his shit. It would be lovely if Joffrey died in battle but Tyrion is actually doing his best to keep everyone alive by leading the defence. As the Bells of King\xe2\x80\x99s Landing ring, Davos has the fleet beat the war drums in response, and wonders why the Lannister fleet isn\xe2\x80\x99t defending the shore. There is only one ship between Stannis and the city, and Davos realises too late that it\xe2\x80\x99s packed with wildfire. In a single moment a huge part of the invading fleet is obliterated by the alchemist\xe2\x80\x99s unquenchable flames. Including Davos\xe2\x80\x99 son. Over the press of screams, Stannis pushes on with the rest to land and storm the gates. While Cersei is getting drunk with Sansa and the highborn women holed up in the Keep, telling her how much they\xe2\x80\x99ll be raped if they lose the fight. Fire arrows rain down on Stannis\xe2\x80\x99 force before they reach the walls and make for the Mud Gate, but the Hound rides out to lead a bloody sortie and Lancel Lannister takes an arrow before reporting back to the queen about the battle so far. So Cersei immediately demands that Joffrey removed from the walls to safety. Now there\xe2\x80\x99s a problem at the Mud Gate \xe2\x80\x93 the only thing the Hound has ever feared is fire, and these burning men are bit much for him, so he hangs back for a drink and a rest, and when Tyrion and Joffrey gives him shit for this, he says fuck the King, and leaves. Joff hides away back to the keep and all of the defenders almost lose hope, until Tyrion steps up, rouses the troops and leads the attack himself on Stannis\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x93 Ah, Love this guy! Shae sends Sansa to her bedchambers to bar the door, but the hound is here, tired of everything and drunk. He offers to take Sansa home to Winterfell, but she stays stupid and he leaves. Stannis has a toehold on the battlements, whilst Tyrions counterattack leads to a bloody mess of a battle, where one of the Goldcloaks tries to kill him, but is murdered just in time by Tyrion\xe2\x80\x99s squire. As he lays stunned and slipping into unconsciousness a third army arrives, the Baratheon banner flies but the new force that\xe2\x80\x99s smashing Stannis\xe2\x80\x99 men is led by Loras Tyrell of Highgarden and commanded by Tywin Lannister himself. Stannis is forced to retreat! The Lannisters have won. Also Cersei was just about to poison Tommen but I guess were not gonna talk about that? Tyrion wakes scarred from the battle in a dingy room, and Pycell enjoys telling him that he\xe2\x80\x99s no longer the Hand of the King with Tywin back in town. In great ceremony Joff proclaims Tywin saviour and hand. It was Petyr Baelish\xe2\x80\x99s idea to Ally with the Tyrells, for which he is granted Harrenhall, and in a rehearsed bit of B.S., they talk of how Margery never banged Renly, so she\xe2\x80\x99s still fresh to marry Joffrey instead of Sansa, who is set aside because of her traitor family. This is great news for Sansa but Littlefinger reminds her of the creepy truth that Joff is still going to abuse her in lots of ways, in and out the bedroom. Ser Mandon Moore, the Goldclak who tried killing Tyrion did so on the orders of Cersei, and Varys also tells him that his mountain clansmen were been paid and sent home, and Bronn was dismissed as captain of the Goldcloaks. Yet despite the scars on his face Shae still puts on a good show and sticks by his side. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to tell if she means it or if she\xe2\x80\x99s still on the clock, but don\xe2\x80\x99t get your hopes up. Brienne is still marching Jaime back home for the hostage swap, but when they\xe2\x80\x99re recognised by three scumbags she\xe2\x80\x99s forced to murder the shit out of them! Daym! Jaime\xe2\x80\x99s cocky banter is suddenly replaced with regard. Robb is still mad at his mother for cutting him loose however and marries Talisa in an unusually stupid move for a king. Back on Dragonstone Stannis licks his wounds and gets a little wife-beaty on Melisandre for promising him victory based on her visions. But she convinces him not to doubt and continue on to his path of glory. Up at Winterfell Theon is surrounded by Northmen forces because he was too stupid and proud to leave with Yara. Luwin urges him to run North and join the Night\xe2\x80\x99s Watch before the castle is taken. But instead he rallies his men for a glorious last stand that will be sung for years to come before, you know, before his own men knock him out and go home. And stab Luwin! While back on the road Jaqen catches up with Arya and she asks him to teach her the ways of killing. He suggests that she come with him across the Narrow sea to Braavos to join the faceless men, a cult of master assassins who change identity with ease. Arya has to stay to find her family however, so Jaqen gives her an ancient coin, some ancient words, and becomes someone else, and leaves. Bran and Rickon were hiding in the crypts of Winterfell this whole time with Hodor and Osha. They surface to discover the castle abandoned and put to the torch. The direwolves are back but Luwin tells them they must head north to the wall and meet up with Jon because it\xe2\x80\x99s too dangerous to find Robb in the middle of the War. Luwin is given peace and there is no longer a Stark in Winterfell. Dany finally goes to the house of the undying to face their sorcery and tricks, entering the tower alone and seeing a vision of a ruined King\xe2\x80\x99s Landing in the dead of Winter. She reaches for the Iron Throne but doesn\xe2\x80\x99t quite touch it before following the sounds of her dragons. Her next sight is North of the wall where she finds Drogo and their son in a Summer tent, again she leaves, and discovers her dragons, chained to an altar and surrounded by creepy warlocks. Turns out the world of magic has grown stronger since the return of dragons, and the warlocks plan to keep them and Dany hostage forever to feed their power. But instead the little mites burn the warlock to death. So Dany has Xaro Xhoan Daxos locked in his own vault as a thankyou and sells his stuff to buy a ship. On the march towards the army of the King beyond the Wall, Qhorin attacks Jon and lets himself be killed for the good of the Watch. Jon is accepted amongst the Wildlings for this, but back at the Fist of the first men Sam and the others hear three blasts of the horn. This is an ancient signal of the Watch that means Others are coming. And we a living army of the dead marching on their position, led by a Whitewalker on his corpse horse. Oh my god! So Tyrion\xe2\x80\x99s no longer Hand despite his hard work, and Sansa is pretty much exactly where she started. Stannis is beaten for now, and Arya is still trying to make her way home, whilst Bran is heading North to the wall with Rickon. Jon is about to play the spy amongst Wildlings, and whilst Theon\xe2\x80\x99s been knocked out Robb\xe2\x80\x99s thinking with his dick. But more importantly the living dead are on the move and maybe none of that other stuff really matters. And also Dany\xe2\x80\x99s about to take a boat somewhere, but to be honest in the books what she gets up to was way better.
