Welcome to Cinema Summary, ladies and gentlemen Love makes you do crazy things and in today's film: one our main characters takes this to the next level To get what I mean, this is SECRET OBSESSION So the film starts with Jennifer being chased by a mysterious man with a knife and after trying to drive away in her car which is connected to a white pick up truck through a winch, she runs away and gets hit by a car and is taken to a hospital where she has flashbacks of her husband and the man who was chasing her breaking into their home. As she\xe2\x80\x99s being prepped for surgery, we see man with glasses rush in: this is Russell Williams, Jennifer\xe2\x80\x99s husband who wants to know if she remembers what happened to her since she the accident. Though he will have to wait for answer as she\xe2\x80\x99s still in surgery and we see him holding a lighter that was gifted to him from Jennifer, we then go to Silverado Canyon, California, where we follow Detective Page who gets a call and goes to the rest stop from the beginning of the film. Page interviews Russel asking if he knew what happened on night of the accident and Russel explains that his wife went out to get groceries for dinner and he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t gotten a call from her and with no marital problems since they\xe2\x80\x99re newlyweds, he has not motive to hurt her and he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know why she was at that rest stop that night So Page doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really get any answers from him although something that Page says is that Jennifer\xe2\x80\x99s car went missing that night Back with Russell, he\xe2\x80\x99s taken to meet with Jennifer but finds out from a doctor that due to the accident she\xe2\x80\x99s gotten amnesia and probably won\xe2\x80\x99t remember her own husband. And when they meet: She really doesn\xe2\x80\x99t remember him or anything about the accident that sent her here or who that man chasing her was. At the police station, Page interviews the driver who hit Jennifer and asks him if he saw anyone or anything else at the crash site. and the man mentions there was a white pickup truck with a winch that was pulling a car that disappeared when the ambulance arrived. Someone was there, Page is sure of it and he continues working on the witnesses of the car crash: including a man in black. Back with Jennifer and Russel he shows her a photo album of the times they had together, and tells her they had worked at the same company and somewhere along the line he proposed to her and while Jennifer and Russel are reuniting, we someone peeking through the window Though looking at these photos, Jennifer wonders if her parents called her yet? And Russel pauses. It\xe2\x80\x99s kind of weird but then we learn that her parents died in a fire. So, it makes sense that he\xe2\x80\x99d be so awkward about it. That night, the man in black \xe2\x80\x93 Mr. Kahn arrives with a bouquet and acts sketchy: he\xe2\x80\x99s not family, just a "concerned citizen", who wants her to have some flowers. Which is quite suspicious to say the least From then on we follow Jennifer as she recovers from her injuries, going through rehab with Russell\xe2\x80\x99s help until finally she\xe2\x80\x99s able to check out. And as she\xe2\x80\x99s checking out, she\xe2\x80\x99s given a cane and made to sign a document when she pauses. She can\xe2\x80\x99t seem to remember how to write her name and when she does, it feels off, not that it matter since she\xe2\x80\x99s going home but while in the car, she remembers looking into a rear view mirror and has a flashback on that rainy night. She\xe2\x80\x99s starting to remember what happened the night of her accident. Russel and Jennifer drive to a house, where Jennifer spots wedding photos of her and Russel and adjusting to whole "being married thing" Anyway, Russell takes her on a tour of the home, but when she sees the living room with the fireplace she remembers the hooded man plunging a knife near a fireplace. They continue going on the tour and we find out that the nearest neighbors are a mile away and that Jennifer can\xe2\x80\x99t remember the life they had together. Once Russel has taken Jennifer upstairs he gets a call from Detective Page which Jennifer overhears. Page tells him that he hasn't found the missing car, but one witness, driving a vintage Cadillac Convertible might have seen the plates of the white pickup truck. and Page ends the call saying he wants to meet with Jennifer tomorrow to get her statement about what happened that night. At dinner, Jennifer asks Russel about what\xe2\x80\x99s happening tomorrow and he lies to her saying it was work calling him. When she asks if their company is worried about her, Russel tells her that she quit her job shortly after moving out here and getting married. So she has no job or parents who \xe2\x80\x98care for her\xe2\x80\x99 what about friends? Oh yeah, a few though they won\xe2\x80\x99t be calling or coming by anytime soon. Which reminds Jennifer that her phone is missing, and Russel promises that he\xe2\x80\x99ll buy her a new phone Later that night, the man in black, Mr. Kahn is visited by Russel who hits him over the head with a crowbar before he kills him, and as suspicious as Mr. Kahn was he really was just a concerned citizen but as we find out someone has a few secrets of there own. Russel drives back to the house and buries Mr. Kahn's body in the backyard as Jennifer wakes up seeing Russel doing something over there and the next morning, Jennifer spots a human shaped mound of dirt in the backyard which makes Jennifer a little suspicious something because something doesn't smell right about this Meanwhile, Page finds out that there are hundreds of people with white pickup trucks and that Russell has decided not to come in to talk about the case. So, Page calls him and tries searching for his home address and finds out that Russell Williams had no address in the Silverado Canyon. So, Page tells a coworker to trace a phone number as he goes out to the hospital where Jennifer was at. He gets Russell\xe2\x80\x99s home address from the Nurse there and asks her if Russell mentioned a white pickup truck which he didn\xe2\x80\x99t and Page goes to the address and finds out not only is it NOT Russell's address the people there have never even heard of Russell Williams meaning that Russell has lied about his home address and what makes it even more suspicious is that the phone number he gave belongs to a burner phone Meanwhile, Jennifer checks out her photo album when she realizes something\xe2\x80\x99s wrong: Russell looks a little photoshopped in the pictures. and after struggling to get downstairs since she hasn\xe2\x80\x99t recovered from the accident she finds that same photoshop effect on her wedding photo. and she tries logging into Russell\xe2\x80\x99s computer using her name as a password but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work and that\xe2\x80\x99s when Russell comes back in and gives her a phone that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have any service That night, Russell tries to get Jennifer in the mood but she freaks out after having a flashback again and can\xe2\x80\x99t get into it. And Russell gets angry with her: Trying to guilt her into doing "it" and its a strategy that fails As she settles in for the night, Russell leaves to go to his study where he spies on Jennifer through a hidden camera. Huh.... Detective Page meanwhile calls the nurse, asking for surveillance footage from the night Jennifer was admitted to the hospital, hoping to find a white pickup truck with a winch. She sends him the footage and after getting asked how Russell confirmed his identity as Jennifer\xe2\x80\x99s husband, we find out he did this by showing some family photos along with identifying a back tattoo on Jennifer, one that looks like a stylish A. When Page checks out the footage not only does he spot the pickup truck but he also sees Russell get out of the pickup truck before heading inside the hospital. Seems likes Russell\xe2\x80\x99s is a big fat liar. But why? Later the next day, Page hits up a tattoo artist and asks about the tattoo on Jennifer\xe2\x80\x99s back which the artist recognizes as a heritage tattoo referring to the family surname \xe2\x80\x9cAllen\xe2\x80\x9d. and it\xe2\x80\x99s an exact match for Jennifer\xe2\x80\x99s tattoo and  when he puts her unmarried name in the database \xe2\x80\x93 Jennifer Allen he finds her parents\xe2\x80\x99 home address which has been abandoned for a while and inside Page finds a room with the rotting bodies of Jennifer\xe2\x80\x99s parents. We then see Jennifer running away from the man with the knife before she wakes up. And as Russell takes a shower and prepares for the day, Jennifer goes through Russell\xe2\x80\x99s pockets finding his wallet which doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have any ID and hides it. After sending him on an errand for groceries, he leaves and locks the door behind him and Jennifer finds her old ID card with her maiden name: Jennifer Allen Before she manages to pick the lock and escape the room Page investigates Russell and Jennifer\xe2\x80\x99s old company, and finds out that the man he met, is not Jennifer\xe2\x80\x99s husband but is in fact Ryan Gaerity a coworker of Jennifer and the real Russel, Jennifer\xe2\x80\x99s actual husband who left a note for Jennifer in her old desk before he disappeared. While at the same time, Jennifer finds evidence that \xe2\x80\x9cRussell\xe2\x80\x9d or Ryan as I will call him from now on faked his photos and finds the real ones on his computer after using her real name as a password. Then Jennifer\xe2\x80\x99s memory of what happened that night of the accident returns and she realizes that the hooded man was Ryan. So she's trapped here with no way to contact anyone as there's no wifi and her phone has no ception since Ryan messed up the phone and after falling nearby the corpse in the yard. Ryan hits her on the head, taking her inside where he forces her to take some medication and ties her up after she reveals she that she knows Ryan isn\xe2\x80\x99t her husband although doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know his real name. Ryan leaves to get lye and runs into the nurse who reveals that Detective Page is onto him Ryan drives off in a rush and returns home as Jennifer wakes up from the meds and escapes her bindings, making it to the kitchen to wrap her hurting ankle in tape, before going into the car in the garage where she finds her old phone. Just as Ryan comes home and we find out that he left the real Russel\xe2\x80\x99s body in Jennifer\xe2\x80\x99s car and Jennifer sneaks her way back to the room, hiding the phone just in time for Ryan to come in who gets distracted as Detective Page has come by to ask some questions. When Page comes to the house, he finds that it belongs to Ryan and also finds the white pickup truck, confirming his suspicions that Ryan had something to do with the accident as Jennifer comes downstairs to try and get his help, Ryan knocks out Page and locks Jennifer up in her room binding her to the bedframe revealing that he\xe2\x80\x99s a stalker with a crush whose been studying her for a long time, ever since they worked together,and he killed her parents and Russell. and he WAS originally going to kill her but since she lost her memory, he could now have her all to himself and that  what his secret obsession was all about. Ryan then goes to dispose of some evidence including that of Page who is stuck in a ice chest as Jennifer burns through her bindings with the real Russell\xe2\x80\x99s lighter \xe2\x80\x93 the lighter that was stolen by Ryan and that we see in the earlier in the film and she escapes. Running into the woods trying to call someone with her old phone as Ryan chases after her armed with a gun and as Page finally manages to escape from the chest. After a long chase and a fight between Ryan and Page who disarms Ryan, Jennifer shoots Ryan with his own gun. Killing him We then fast forward 3 months later and Jennifer comes to visit Page to thank for his help and to say goodbye as he\xe2\x80\x99s moving. But before he leaves, Page gives Jennifer the thing that Russell, the real one, left in her desk and the movie ends with her reading a love letter dedicated to her by Russel.
