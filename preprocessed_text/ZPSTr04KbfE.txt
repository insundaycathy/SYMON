If you mistakenly chose to be nice to the weird kid in school, then, after you ignored some of their messages, they committed ritualistic suicide so they could possess and murder your friends and family so you could experience their loneliness, what could you do? In this video on Nerd Explains, I'll tell you how to beat the Computer Witch, in, Friend Request. Let\xe2\x80\x99s say we are Laura in the beginning of the movie. We don\xe2\x80\x99t have perfect knowledge and we don\xe2\x80\x99t know how this ends, all we know is what the characters know. Can we beat this situation? Let\xe2\x80\x99s find out. We start out as a popular, good-looking college girl, with so many friends, so many, just look at the facebook friend counter. When grabbing lunch between classes, we glance over and see a weird loner girl checking us out from across the cafeteria. Apparently she is in our psych class as well. Later that night, she sends us a friend request saying she\xe2\x80\x99s from our psych class and hopes we can be friends, with a smiley face. This is the first important decision we need to make. I\xe2\x80\x99d say denying her friend request is perfectly justified. Let me explain why. We take a look at her profile and she has zero friends, zero. Every picture is put through a black and white filter, and all her posts and images are really dark and goth. It\xe2\x80\x99s abundantly clear we have literally nothing in common with this girl. The fact that she immediately wants to be friends when she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even know us is a bit concerning. We haven\xe2\x80\x99t hung out, participated in a study group, or said anything to each other. The only interaction we\xe2\x80\x99ve had is seeing her creepily check us out from across the cafeteria. There is nothing that should give us any reason to become friends all the sudden. I mean, I know this is college and people are more willing to branch out and make friends with strangers, but still, it\xe2\x80\x99s strange. Her animations and artwork are really good. Considering the timeline, she\xe2\x80\x99s completing these and posting these like every day, which would require a ton of skill. This chick is talented. Which means it\xe2\x80\x99s even weirder that she has zero friends. How can someone with that talent and pronounced set of beliefs not find a friend. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure plenty of people would be interested in either talking with her about her sulky shit, or hiring her for her artistic abilities. This isn\xe2\x80\x99t Salem where there\xe2\x80\x99s twenty uptight dicks in a medieval village. It\xe2\x80\x99s 2016 with the internet. You can be the strangest, most fringe lunatic imaginable and still find friends. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s possible to not find one decent, actual friend in the 4 billion active internet users or 8 billion people on this planet. For christ\xe2\x80\x99s sake there are entire groups of people that dress up in animal suits and fuck each other, and you can\xe2\x80\x99t find one friend, really? She should have at least some friends, unless ya know, there\xe2\x80\x99s something horribly wrong with her. Maybe she wants a real life friend that models what she considers to be the perfect life, as an escape from her own deficiencies. Maybe like Laura said, she\xe2\x80\x99s just new and started her Facebook profile. Okay, but that\xe2\x80\x99s super easy to check. Facebook literally tells you when she created her profile, not to mention you can scroll her newsfeed or images to quickly see the first post they made. Considering she has zero friends, I\xe2\x80\x99d check to see if it was a new profile. If it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t new, that\xe2\x80\x99s even weirder. In the movie, Laura doesn\xe2\x80\x99t click on her images, which is the most laughable, unlikely mistake. A college girl who's obsessed with social media doesn\xe2\x80\x99t check out the images section of someone\xe2\x80\x99s Facebook profile, right. If we did check this creepy girl's images to see when her first post was, or just to generally find out more about her, we\xe2\x80\x99d probably find more creepy shit. And who on Earth accepts a friend request from someone like this without some extra investigation. I\xe2\x80\x99d definitely at least Google her to see if she shows up on Murderpedia or something. She\xe2\x80\x99s not using her real name, Ma Rina, which is odd as well. There is literally no online information about this creepy girl who wants to be our friend out of the blue. Red flags are popping up everywhere. Marina also has trichotillomania, which is a mental illness. But, combined with everything else we know about her, it\xe2\x80\x99s most likely a form of self-harm to seek relief from emotional distress, not some advanced OCD. It should be pretty obvious that she\xe2\x80\x99s damaged, probably suicidal, and obviously is lonely and looking for someone to emotionally attach and cling to. If we continued to scroll her homepage a bit we\xe2\x80\x99d see her interests section. In the movie they just scroll past this section and think nothing of it. Her interests section consists of some passable stuff that a goth girl might be into, like dark woods and magick. The spelling of magick is interesting though, as the k at the end is used to differentiate it as occult magick, not some David Blaine shit. That\xe2\x80\x99s a bit weird. Hymenopterology, which is the study of wasps, is also out of place. So she\xe2\x80\x99s just randomly interested in wasps, nothing about this girl is normal. If we type Magick and wasps into Google, the results are about witchcraft. There\xe2\x80\x99s also a top interest on Scrying. Scrying is some witchcraft that has to do with portals to other realms or something. Even though I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in witchcraft, I'm still going to avoid people who do. Oh, and how could I forget the disturbing ass two-faced baby with the letters SRA. A quick googling on this as well reveals that SRA stands for Satanic Ritualistic Abuse. What. the. Fuck. Dark woods? Okay. Wasps? Weird, but okay. Scrying? Obsessions of witchcraft are disconcerting for sure. Satanic Ritualistic Abuse? Nope, fuck that shit. I\xe2\x80\x99m not accepting your friend request or hanging out with you, ever. With some common sense Facebook stalkage, we\xe2\x80\x99d 100% end up denying her friend request. Simply avoiding adding her as a friend and nipping this whole thing in the bud would quite possibly stop all the future tragedies from occurring as they did. Now, there\xe2\x80\x99s a chance that she\xe2\x80\x99d fixate on us and continue pressing us to be friends. How should we handle this? We need to ignore all her online messages. If she confronts us in person asking if we want to be friends, we\xe2\x80\x99ll politely but firmly decline. If she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t give up after we declined all her previous advances, it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty clear we have a stalker on our hands. According to Google, one of the most important things to do at this point is to not engage them at all. Stalkers will typically misconstrue any contact or interaction as validation of a relationship between us. We don\xe2\x80\x99t want to make threats or jump straight into obtaining a restraining order, this may just infuriate them and cause them to get violent. Besides that, we need to document everything that happens, stay vigilant, make sure our home is locked up at night, and probably buy some mace for good measure. In California, which is where Laura is going to college, stalking is defined as any person who willfully, maliciously, and repeatedly follows or harasses another person and who makes a credible threat with the intent to place that person in reasonable fear for his or her safety, or the safety of his or her immediate family. If weeks pass and Marina hasn\xe2\x80\x99t moved, and instead has gotten more aggressive, elevate the situation to the police. You\xe2\x80\x99ll likely be able to get her charged with stalking with the evidence you\xe2\x80\x99ve accrued documenting all your encounters. According to mental-illness-policy.org, if someone is considered to be imminently dangerous due to a mental illness, they can be involuntarily admitted to a psychiatric hospital. In the movie we later see that she\xe2\x80\x99s already been diagnosed with psychosis, reactive attachment disorder, and trichotillomania. Considering these illnesses will be discovered when she\xe2\x80\x99s being investigated, it\xe2\x80\x99s likely that we could get her involuntarily admitted. If we successfully get her admitted, she might not be able to do some ritualistic black mirror suicide so she could possess and murder our friends, and we could go about our life as normal. Say we stupidly accepted her friend request through pity, and we went for a nice walk after class to get to know each other. Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ll quickly realize our mistake when she starts blowing up our DM\xe2\x80\x99s saying that she feels like our souls are connected and we already know each other well because we share everything on social media. We start having nightmares of her standing outside our window at night, and the next morning we see that she has photoshopped a picture of us two together, and is going through every single one of our facebook posts. She skypes us to ask about our birthday party and if she can come. What do we do now? I\xe2\x80\x99m in agreement with Laura\xe2\x80\x99s friends, saying fuck no, just in a nicer way. Probably best not to lie about not having a party when it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be posted all over our Facebook profile that she\xe2\x80\x99s stalking. We\xe2\x80\x99ll just tell her it was nice meeting her but this party is with our long-time close friends and family and you haven\xe2\x80\x99t really known her that long. She\xe2\x80\x99s probably still going to blow up as she\xe2\x80\x99s mentally ill but it\xe2\x80\x99s better than straight up lying and for sure looking like a bitch. Or at least we can say our friends surprised us. I think either way we handle it, she\xe2\x80\x99s going to blow. Like we talked about earlier, it\xe2\x80\x99s better to firmly decline and ignore, rather than lie to the stalker and continue to validate their perception that you\xe2\x80\x99re in a relationship. Hopefully doing this will avoid her public freakout and humiliation that sparks her thirst for revenge because she thinks we\xe2\x80\x99re a lying deceptive piece of shit. It\xe2\x80\x99s still likely that she\xe2\x80\x99ll turn murderous when we unfriend her on Facebook, as she\xe2\x80\x99s obviously treading a thin mental line between functioning and psychotic. Cue the archetypal thunderstorm the night we unfriend her. Definitely not a bad sign. We hear some creepy voices in the hallway and go to check it out. There\xe2\x80\x99s a black mirror on the wall, it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing that we put up, and it\xe2\x80\x99s almost identical to the one in Marina\xe2\x80\x99s Facebook newsfeed animation. Personally, I would not look into that mirror, hell no. Our friend snaps us out of it, and we see that the strange black mirror is gone. I love how in the movie Laura just passes this off as a bad dream like the nightmare we had earlier on. This is way different. We were studying in our room, heard creepy voices, and straight up completely hallucinated a scrying mirror on the wall with a dark figure moving in the mirror, exactly like Marina\xe2\x80\x99s animation. If Laura was munching on shrooms before this than sure, but otherwise this would be really fucking alarming. Considering we have a stalker after us that\xe2\x80\x99s into witchcraft, we definitely need to take into account that something is happening that can\xe2\x80\x99t just be coincidental. The next morning in class, the teacher announces that Marina committed suicide. Obviously we\xe2\x80\x99re going to feel a bit guilty, even though we did nothing wrong. Up until now, it\xe2\x80\x99s all been mostly unfortunate and weird happenings. But now, the seriously messed up shit starts happening. Later that night, we get a buzz on our computer. It\xe2\x80\x99s a message from Marina. Ohhhhh shit. Even worse, it\xe2\x80\x99s a video. It looks like a portrait sketch of us, probably the birthday present she made for us. The picture gets crumpled up by Marina, and she hangs herself over a fire in front of her webcam. The real question is how did she get internet connection down there, and how did she hit stop record and then send the video after committing suicide. Spooky. And why did she need to light herself on fire and hang herself, seem redundant and overkill. The next day, we get text messages asking us, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy we posted it on Facebook.\xe2\x80\x9d Jesus, that phrase is enough to induce an anxiety attack in anyone that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t even experienced what we have. We log on and find out that Marina\xe2\x80\x99s suicide video was somehow posted on our Facebook page. Of course we try deleting it, but we get an unknown error. We call Facebook\xe2\x80\x99s customer support, they say they physically can\xe2\x80\x99t remove the post or our account. Okayyy. If we\xe2\x80\x99re being realistic, Facebook would definitely identify the ghost code and Zuckerberg would be getting a phone call within the hour. In the movie we end up relying on Kobe, aka hackerman, and find out that there is some haunted ghost code that\xe2\x80\x99s preventing us from doing so. Now this ghost code shit is pretty damning that there is something crazy going on. We also find out from Kobe that Marina is still posting on Facebook. And she\xe2\x80\x99s posting some seriously disturbing stuff. What oh what shall we do? I mean, even without there being ghost code in the source code of the page, we can\xe2\x80\x99t allow a hacker to post suicide videos on our online accounts. Our reputation, future job prospects and relationships are all going to be tainted. We could also be charged with crimes for it too. The ghost code though, that\xe2\x80\x99s the real concern. And it\xe2\x80\x99s not just a concern to you. The hacking and supernatural abilities that Marina possesses is an existential threat to everyone on the planet. This is definitely above our paygrade, which is nonexistent because we\xe2\x80\x99re a psych student in college. We need to take this to the highest level. We need to contact Facebook, the police, the government, science organizations, news agencies, post on reddit forums, and literally spread the word everywhere. Since this ghost code can be seen by everyone, and since Facebook was technically unable to take our posts or account down due to it, it\xe2\x80\x99s reasonable to assume that anyone testing this will run into this ghost code as well. You think Zuckerberg isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to flip shit at haunted code controlling Facebook and posting suicide videos that can\xe2\x80\x99t be taken down? The brightest minds and organizations with the biggest budgets will start working on reverse engineering it and come up with a plan to remedy it. Finding out what\xe2\x80\x99s going on is super important. These black mirrors are supposedly interdimensional or something, I mean, we could easily end up doing something wrong or not knowing about an important danger of them, We\xe2\x80\x99d also succeed in convincing everyone that we actually can't delete the videos on our account and that nobody should be mad at us because our account is essentially being hacked by a super hackers ghost code. Unfortunately, nobody would be able to stop Marina's next actions. We find out Gustavo is dead. There is security footage of his death. He seemingly lost his mind and committed suicide by bashing his head into the wall repeatedly. Obviously this is not Gustavo's doing. All this shit is connected. Marina's witchcraft and suicide, our hallucination of the scrying mirror, the ghost code. While taking it to the highest level is still probably the best course of action, let\xe2\x80\x99s instead see what we could personally do without the rest of the world intervening. It doesn't take much digging to reveal that in fiction and folklore, scrying mirrors were used as portals to communicate with other realms,and they can be used to possess unsuspecting onlookers. It\xe2\x80\x99s probable that Marina possessed Gustavo through a black mirror hallucination like the one we experienced. It sounds fucking rediculous, I mean, what is this the plot from a shitty netflix horror movie? Nothing that's occurring seems to be possible, but extraordinary circumstances calls for extraordinary solutions. We find out via a 4chan article, that the only way to defeat it is to destroy the mirror that Marina used for her suicidal scrying ritual. Before trying to destroy a mirror based on a 4chan article, we'd probably want to consult with the scientists we opened a dialogue with earlier. Ya know, just in case 4chan was somehow wrong. Marina posts the footage of Gustavo\xe2\x80\x99s death on our Facebook page. We try to write on our Facebook page that we aren\xe2\x80\x99t in control and that it\xe2\x80\x99s being hacked. Before we can post it, Marina hacks it and rewrites a different message. She writes that she wants us to feel as alone as she does. Starting with Gustavo, she\xe2\x80\x99s going after our friends and family, one by one, killing them via possession driven suicide. What do we do? Since we can\xe2\x80\x99t feel lonely if we\xe2\x80\x99re dead, we\xe2\x80\x99re most likely safe. With Gustavo being singled out and killed earlier, Marina doesn\xe2\x80\x99t appear to be able to possess and kill multiple people at a time. By themselves, our friends and family are vulnerable. Together, they are safer. If Marina can only possess one of them at a time, then the others in the group could restrain them before they harm themselves. While it\xe2\x80\x99s risky, it\xe2\x80\x99s necessary. We need to contact all of our close friends and family. We need to tell them that after this call they need to drop all their technology, drop their phones and laptops, drop anything that could resemble a mirror. Anything that can resemble a black mirror is dangerous as it\xe2\x80\x99s a portal that Marina can use to possess them and force them to commit suicide. Tell them they need to throw some food and water into a backpack and to all meet up at a nearby park. They need to get rid of any weapon, as there is nothing real that attacks them, Marina will just make them commit suicide with it. Tell them we\xe2\x80\x99ll find and tell them when it\xe2\x80\x99s safe to return. These people have known us for a long time, there is enough evidence of crazy shit going on to convince them. If we say to do this and that they need to trust us, they will probably do it. Now that they are as safe as can be, we can attempt to find and destroy the black mirror, or laptop, that Marina used in her suicide. It\xe2\x80\x99s our best shot at stopping this. We need to figure out who the fuck Marina actually is. Although the school database was wiped, her dorm room contained lots of evidence. Most importantly, a picture of her orphanage with her as a kid. Easy enough, go to the orphanage, show them a picture of her, get a name from their records. We find that her last name is Marina Nedifar. We also get some lovely stories about how she was tormented and bullied. Bonus points for getting the orphanage shut down for allowing bullying and physical abuse of the orphans, and doing absolutely nothing about the severe mental issues that an orphan was improperly dealing with. Marina is not discrete at all, she pretty much posts everything that matters to her online. All her posts, artwork, and animations are clues as to what she is dealing with, her childhood trauma, who she\xe2\x80\x99s going to kill next, and important locations. It won\xe2\x80\x99t be hard to find the place of her suicide as she\xe2\x80\x99s very sentimental and likely to off herself at a place of deep emotional importance. This will also be the place of the black mirror we need to destroy. Here\xe2\x80\x99s the tricky part, and where Laura fucked up in the movie. We already know that looking into black mirrors is dangerous, as it\xe2\x80\x99s an attack vector for Marina. The black mirror that Marina committed suicide infront of is probably particularly dangerous to look at. In the movie, when Laura got close to the computer, Marina started calling to her to come to the computer. Uh you should do the opposite of that shit. In order for scrying for work and a demonic internet connection to occur, you need to be reasonably close and gaze into the black mirror. So whatever you do, keep your distance, don\xe2\x80\x99t look at it, blindfold yourself if possible. Maybe bring a molotov cocktail and toss it at the computer. Once you\xe2\x80\x99ve destroyed the original black mirror, you need to make sure you actually stopped Marina. Test deleting the Facebook posts and checking for ghost code. If it's not there, go find your friends at the park and reintroduce tech to one person in the group. We\xe2\x80\x99ll also want to use a buddy system for the following week so that nobody is completely alone if they do get possessed somehow. If destroying the mirror doesn\xe2\x80\x99t stop the killings, the only other option is to kill ourselves. It\xe2\x80\x99s a shitty option and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily stop Marina, but if it\xe2\x80\x99s between that and all your friends and family getting murdered, it might be the right choice. Hopefully it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t come to us killing ourselves though. Hopefully, we were able to make enough correct decisions to successfully not get possessed and turned into Marina 2.0 like Laura at the end of the movie. What do you think? How would you beat Marina? Let me know in the comments. If you enjoy these how to beat videos, consider subscribing. If you have a movie you\xe2\x80\x99d like me to talk about beating next, let me know. Thanks for watching, later.
