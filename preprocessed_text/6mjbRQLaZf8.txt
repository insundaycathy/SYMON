Welcome back for another 5 minute movie recap. Today, I'm going to give you an overview of the 2018 American horror film called 'A Quiet Place'. The film is directed by John Krasinski and written by Bryan Woods, Scott Beck and Krasinski. The storey focuses on a father and a mother who have to contend with blind creatures with an incredible sense of hearing while they fight to keep their family alive and well in a post-apocalyptic world. Warning: there will be spoilers ahead, so please proceed with caution. After 89 days, the majority of Earth's human population has been destroyed by blind monsters with acute hearing who attack everything that makes a sound. A layer of armor-like skin covers the extraterrestrial beings, which resist bullets and explosions. In a desolate town, the Abbott family\xe2\x80\x94wife Evelyn, husband Lee, Regan, a deaf teenage daughter, and Lee's younger sons Marcus and Beau\xe2\x80\x94seek for supplies while remaining quiet. When the family is outdoors, they use American Sign Language to communicate. Four-year-old Beau is intrigued to a battery-powered space shuttle toy, but because the item would create noise, his brother, six-year-old Lee, snatches it away. Beau replaces the batteries, then gives the toy back to Regan. When the family is crossing a bridge, Beau activates the toy, and it causes a neighbouring monster to murder him. Over a year after the incident, Regan continues to suffer with guilt, Evelyn is pregnant with her last child, and Lee is trying to establish radio communication with the outside world. Lee uses scavenged amplifiers to attempt to improve Regan's cochlear implant, but the implants fail. Lee takes Marcus to a neighbouring river with a huge waterfall where he teaches him to fish while Regan visits Beau's monument, which is located far away from the two of them. When other strong background noise makes it harder for the animals to hear, Lee informs Marcus it is safe to communicate. Regan claims that she believes she bears some responsibility for Beau's death and requires her father to affirm that he loves her. At the home, Evelyn goes into labour when she is all alone. As she was heading to the basement, she stepped on an exposed nail and dropped a glass picture frame, making a nearby critter aware of her presence. Once she flicks the switch, the external home lights become red to indicate to the others that she is in labour. Lee arrives to the property and tells Marcus to blow off pyrotechnics as a ruse to cover their approach. When Lee discovers that Evelyn is hiding in the toilet with their newborn boy, he's upset. As a result, they find themselves in the makeshift soundproofed basement. Lee departs to look for the other children. While Evelyn is asleep, she discovers that a pipe has broken, causing the basement to flood, and that an intruder is in the house with her. The siblings notify their father by building a fire on top of a grain silo and taking cover inside of it. Yet, before Lee notices, the fire runs out of lighter fluid. Marcus unexpectedly falls into the silo as a hatch door breaks way. The door that falls confuses the monster that was following Evelyn, causing it to switch its attention to Marcus and Regan instead. While Marcus dives in after Marcus, who had already plunged in, Regan nearly suffocates in the corn but Marcus saves her. The cochlear implant emits a high-frequency sound to deter the organism. As the children break out of the silo, they encounter their father. The thing reappears, striking Lee and injuring him. Marcus and Regan seek refuge in a vehicle, but they are found and attacked by the creature. Drawing the creature's attention away from his father to the truck, Marcus yells. Before he yells to attract the monster, Lee signals to Regan that he loves her and always has. It assaults and then kills Lee. While Regan and Marcus attempt to get away from the approaching army, they deliberately roll their truck down a hill in order to reconnect with Evelyn and their infant daughter at the farmhouse. They all head downstairs to hide. Regan, who has learned to recognise the sound of the implant, does it again, only this time she connects the device to a microphone that is amplified. The monster's exposed skin provides Evelyn with a clear shot, allowing her to execute the thing with a shotgun. The family witnesses a CCTV monitor, which shows two monsters heading toward the house where a gunshot has been fired. As a result of this information, Evelyn loads her gun again.
