welcome back to recapped. today, i am going to show you action slash comedy from 2017, title baywatch. spoilers ahead. watch out and take care. the film starts with lieutenant mitch buchanan arriving at work to perform his duties as a lifeguard on the beaches of emerald bay, florida. he sees a man parasailing on the water, but the man hits his head on a rock, forcing mitch to spring into action. he dives into the ocean and swims to the man's rescue. following this, mitch goes for his morning run around the bay. he passes through sergeant allerby, a local policeman and beach patrol officer with whom he frequently messes with regarding their status as enforcers of the law around that area. while continuing his run, mitch spots a small boy picking up a pouch of the drug flock on the beach. mitch takes it from the boy and observes it. ronnie is flying a toy craft on the beach with his colleague, dave, when cj runs up to wish ronnie good luck on the upcoming qualifiers. but ronnie can barely put a sentence together. around her arriving on the bay is matt brody on his motorcycle. he tries to introduce himself to one of the prospective lifeguards, summer quinn, but she ignores him. brody then meets mitch and stephanie, explaining his new position on the team and his status as a two-time olympic gold medal winner. but neither of them care. mitch tells brodie he has to earn his job, and brody tells him off. ronnie is on the beach with dave eating baby carrots. when he sees cj again, he starts to choke, leading cj to perform the heimlick on him. ronnie spits out the carrot, but he also has an erection. before cj can see it, ronnie jumps onto a wooden lawn chair and gets his whole groin stuck between the boards. things get worse when mitch comes over to help. as observes, ronnie's got both his beef and biscuits stuck in there. other beachgoers show up and start filming him. when mitch opts to pull it out like a tooth, ronnie tries running, but instead falls face first breaking the chair and getting unstuck. meanwhile, victoria leeds, the new owner of the beaches huntley club, is meeting with councilman rodriguez over a real estate deal. in exchange for his services, leeds gives him a new watch that her men wear. later, mitch rounds up all the new hopeful lifeguards to begin their test in the obstacle course. brody sits it out as he feels he doesn't have to do it summer. gives it her all and passes through the course. though ronnie struggles at first due to being heavier than the others. still, he refuses to give up and keeps going, which mitch takes notice of. mitch puts brody through his own specialized course, which involves ridiculous tasks such as lifting large truck tires and hauling refrigerators like weights. nearby on the pier, two young children fall into the water, and their mother jumps in after them. mitch, steph and cj head in to rescue them, while brody follows and tries to be a hero. he goes to rescue the mother, but she keeps smacking him. mitch and cj rescue the kids and steph rides them to safety. brody just ends up looking foolish by the end of the day. mitch announces summer, ronnie and brodie as his new trainees. at night, summer and cj find brody sleeping under the pier. cj takes him to find a place to crash, making him think she is taking him to steph's home, but he is really going to be staying with mitch. mitch lets him stay and makes him sleep on a couch next to a fish tank with a minifigure of mitch watching him. brody begins training under mitch. across the beach, he nearly steps on a poisonous sea urchin until mitch points it out on the water. rodriguez tells leeds that he made arrangements with his people for the real estate deal, but because he did not deliver on time, leeds has her two thugs, frankie and leon, come around to intimidate rodriguez. he tries to call leeds's bluff by saying he knows about her pushing drugs. she leaves her men to deal with rodriguez. steph answers a call about a yacht burning up on the beach. the whole team, including the trainees, rush out there to find the burning boat. mitch hops on the boat and rescues three women, but also finds an unconscious man. brody dives under the water to try and help, but he gets caught under the fire. steph uses her jet ski to splash water around the fire, while summer pulls brody out. when they get back to the shore, they find that the man they pulled out is dead, and it's rodriguez. ellerbee shows up, and mitch tries to talk about what they've investigated, but a lurby tells him to stay out of what is a police matter. after ronnie is in the shower singing when cj walks in and interrupts him. she is impressed by his singing, and also tells him that we shower with our shorts on, and slaps his groin before walking out. the team sits down to have lunch and discuss the fact that a dead body has turned up. in addition to finding more flock on the women they rescued. they decide to attend the open house to get any more information on leads that they can get. we then see that dave is working for leeds as her tech guy. he attempts to blackmail her so that he doesn't say anything about rodriguez's murder. she has something else in mind. that evening, the team goes undercover at the open house party. they assigned brody to be lookout, to have eyes on leads. he does manage to get leads alone, but he doesn't get any information because he's more focused on getting drunk. ronnie distracts leads while the others go to work by doing a crazy dance that gets cj's attention. mitch then goes to confront brody over his failure at his task. brody curses mitch out and tells him he's just a lifeguard. mitch humiliates brody further by scaring him into falling into a pool where he pukes again and everyone sees. brody plays it off by telling everyone do shots. but he passes out. meanwhile, frankie and leon take dave's dead body on a boat out to the sea and slather him with meat chunks as they dump him in there to be shark food. the next morning, mitch tells brody that he is great at what he does when he's on his own, but when it comes to working as part of a team, he fails to do so because he is selfish and only cares about himself. brody begs for a second chance and tells mitch in summer that he noticed rodriguez wearing the watch. that leads his goonswear the trio, head to the morgue to continue their investigation. by disguising themselves as hospital staff. in the morgue, they find rodriguez's corpse and autopsy files. mitch orders brody to look under rodriguez's scrotum for anything. but it's just an opportunity by mitch to further humiliate brody by getting pics of brody looking at a dead guy's taint. summer sees frankie and leon approaching. the three hide in the drawers, but brody ends up hiding on top of a dead old lady. to make things worse, he has fat from a corp stripping on his face. the goons then open up rodriguez's drawer and swap out an autopsy file to make it look like he did die from the fire. brody then freaks out when the fat drips into his mouth, so he jumps out and gets hand sanitizer on his mouth. they are further exposed when summer's phone rings. leon grabs the phone and runs out with frankie. leon tosses summer's phone to frankie. mitch goes after frankie, while brody and summer try to catch leon. mitch chases frankie on a jet ski and finds him trying to break into a family's home. the two fight in a little girl's bedroom after frankie breaks the phone, until mitch puts a diaper bin on frankie's head and knocks him out the window into the pool. mitch, brody and summer all meet with sergeant the lurby as he angrily tells them to stop getting involved in the case. captain thorpe also shows up as the three try explaining that they did have evidence against leeds as men, but all the evidence has been destroyed. thorpe threatens to fire mitch if he continues his investigation. frankie gets away with everything after complaining to the police over mitch's actions. mitch observes the huntley getting their fish from another company, which he thinks is how they are smuggling flakka onto the beach. he and brodie go undercover and sneak into the huntley's kitchen where they find leeds as men handling drugs. mitch calls a lurby to report, but allerby is tied up with having found dave's body being partially torn up by sharks. hillerby also has thorpe listen to mitch calling. thorpe calls mitch into his office to fire him. he appoints brody to be the new lieutenant. but mitch tells thorpe that the position should go to stephanie, since she knows the beach just as well as he does. thorpe doesn't care for mitch's opinion and dismisses him. although brody tries to decline the offer, thorpe threatens him with a bad record for his community service. the others aren't happy with brody taking the position, despite his attempts to defend himself. brody starts to handle things on the beach despite not having everyone's support. he catches a punk on the beach stealing people's stuff with a cooler that pulls things in. he tackles the thief and scares him away. when he opens the cooler, brody finds a bag of flakka. he then asks steph and cj to help give back everyone's things. brody goes to allerby's office to give him a chocolate smoothie, but also to use the cooler to take a file off his desk without him knowing. mitch takes a new job at a phone store and cuts off connection with the rest of his team. when he looks ready to give up, he is approached by his old mentor, the original mitch, david hasselhoff. he inspires mitch to keep up his work and to not give up on himself or his people. brody approaches summer with a file showing dave's corpse. ronnie sees the pics and recognizes dave. he tells the others that dave mentioned working with leeds. ronnie later shows brody how he can hack into leeds's servers, leading them to discover leeds's ultimate plan. she wants to
