Welcome to Slash Forward. Today we\xe2\x80\x99re going to ponder a scenario that is likely better left to the imagination. So, imagine if you will, moving out to the country with dreams of becoming a small town physician only to discover the market has evaporated, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t spend enough to get a good inspection on your new home, and you\xe2\x80\x99re living directly in the middle of a prime spider orgy melting pot that consists of a highly aggressive and organized, previously undescribed Venezuelan murder spider linking up with the most robust local variety. As pets begin to go missing and people around town begin dying mysteriously, you find yourself unable to mount a solid investigation or elicit any sort of cooperation due to your lack of social currency. As a true arachnophobe, when things do go well, the ultimate solution ends up being the worst possible scenario that could be created for you. What options would be open to you, when mother nature herself has decided to hit the self-destruct button? Is there even enough fire available, and would it burn at a sufficient heat to rid the town of this scourge? In order to try to figure this all out, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to summon our courage and be brave and examine the 1990 creature-feature Arachnophobia. Yes, we have to do it, I\xe2\x80\x99ve already watched the movie. Be sure to keep your eyes peeled for any missed opportunities and leave a comment with any tips or tricks you have developed for managing spider situations in your personal life. Let\xe2\x80\x99s get to it. We open over a rainforest at dusk, and take a trip down the lazy river. Deep in the heart of the forest Mr. Manley is eventually delivered to Dr. Atherton\xe2\x80\x99s camp. Arriving late, he is immediately whisked off toward the wilderness. He\xe2\x80\x99s tasked with photographing their venture into a Tpui On the way in, Manley is provided the helpful warning that much of the fauna here would desire to digest his nutrient rich flesh (pink something, but may have already put this elsewhere?) So it\xe2\x80\x99s best to try not to touch or be touched by anything...in the dense Venezuelan rainforest. We get some big Jurassic Park vibes as they touch down near a lush sinkhole. The equipment is lowered to the bottom as they prepare to hike it - guideless, as the tribesman who has agreed to assist them only promised to take them as far as the trailhead, apparently. Well, thanks I guess. They reunite with their equipment and Manley faceplants his way into a terrible discovery, which is brushed off as they proceed deep into the bellybutton of the wilderness. They find a nice, big tree and begin setting up. The plan? Smoke \xe2\x80\x98em if you got \xe2\x80\x98em! They don\xe2\x80\x99t have to wait long before untold quantities of specimens rain down on them, with about 10% actually landing in the jars they set up. As they sift through, greedy for new discoveries, they hear some louder thuds and find a collection of big honkin\xe2\x80\x99 spiders. They\xe2\x80\x99re amazed to find that they survived the smokeshow, so they snag a couple of samples plus one stowaway. Back at camp it\xe2\x80\x99s discovered that these are soldier spiders - they have no reproductive organs, and likely serve a single General. Fascinating as this all is, Manley needs to go try to nap off his fever. Unfortunately, he has an unwelcome bedfellow which sinks its bite-things into him, exacerbating his already present illness to a significant degree. When he is found, they presume he succumbed to his fever, allowing them to proceed with a clean conscience. With no reverence for the empty shell, they strip his belongings of any valuable filmstock and send his empty meat suit back stateside in a shipping crate sans packing materials, but with one more spider than is typically desirable. On the other side of the water we catch up with the hearse as it delivers him to a simple, smalltown funeral home. Irv cracks the top and then makes a quick call about the open casket situation. You see, big Roy\xe2\x80\x99s taken advantage of the long trip over to turn Manley into his own, personal Bento box. He then shuffles out, scaring off the domestics, before being granted fast travel by a passing crow. He manages to end the livery service right near an old barn right as the Jennings roll up to their new home. Here we meet Ross, who has arrived in Canaima with his family to raise his children in a nurturing environment, take over the practice of the soon-to-retire town physician, and to find enough space to stretch out and build a bitchin wine cellar. Tom rushes out to complain that there\xe2\x80\x99s a spider on his stuff. In this household, it's the wife's duty to handle these situations, so Molly gently removes the spider and gives her a new home in the barn. That evening, the couple briefly discusses their anxieties and expectations around their new life away from the city, and provide each other carnal comfort while barnside a couple of new acquaintances come together in similar, sensual pleasure. The next day we find Ross in dire straits - old man Metcalf has thought it over and decided that he wants to postpone his retirement. To add to this, Sheriff Parsons declines to show the reverence Ross feels is owed to the new hot-shot young doctor. Ms. Hollins comes to his rescue, helping him navigate the town politics and, recognizing the need for some fresh blood in the medical field, offers to be his first patient. Sure enough, utilizing more recent medical information, he is able to take her off her hypertension medication as it\xe2\x80\x99s not recommended based on her results. Margaret then offers to throw Ross an open house to help him meet and network with the townsfolk and build up his patient base. Meanwhile, bored at home, Molly decides to scope out their fully-furnished barn to see if she can get any good shots. Here she finds nature hard at work, and becomes enamoured with its boundless majesty - beautiful. That evening, Molly suggests Ross face down this web as a form of acclimation therapy to get over his fear of spiders. On the way out we learn that his crippling fear stems from his first memory as a baby. A disgusting, hairy spider invaded his crib and crawled all over his helpless body, instilling in him an instinct to freeze in response to a spider\xe2\x80\x99s threat. Regardless, he climbs the ladder and takes a face shot from a dessicated rat, and the couple runs off giggling while a bubbling mass throbs nearby. The next day we see that there are party\xe2\x80\x99s all over town - Ross is busy trying to get between the bluehairs and their lust for deviled eggs so he can talk medical conditions and their treatment. While back at the barn, the broodlings are absolutely popping off and venturing into the surrounding areas. As the guests filter out, and Margaret basks in the glow of a successful party, an unassuming arachnid lies in wait. It seeks to grow fat on the housecat\xe2\x80\x99s sweet juices. Unfortunately, after being put out, Ms. Hollins is now the only animal left in the house. The next day, while working in the cellar, Ross discovers why it\xe2\x80\x99s worth spending a bit extra on an experienced home inspector. Molly offers to call the exterminator if Ross goes to check on Margaret who she can\xe2\x80\x99t reach. When he gets there, the paper is uncollected and the cat is still outside. In the aftermath, Metcalf declares her dead by heart attack, which they blame on Ross taking her off her meds. With no authority or influence, Ross is unable to compel them to conduct an autopsy to be sure. However, in a positive turn of events, Mr. Beechwood takes pity on Ross and requests he come by the gym later so he can throw him some business. We then get the pleasure of meeting Delbert, who arrives at the Jennings residence to assess their termite problem. The main points to take away here are that Delbert\xe2\x80\x99s a goofball, as implied by his musical accompaniment . And also that aside from the rotted wood, he curiously doesn\xe2\x80\x99t find any actual presence of termites. While this is going down, Ross arrives at the gym. He and Henry exchange pleasantries about rural life, but also note the recent, conspicuous absence of crickets singing their evening song. Then Ross heads down the line, cupping some sacks and making himself a quick 50 bucks. Afterward at practice, we see the brood has been spreading through town, with one soldier even finding its way into Miller\xe2\x80\x99s helmet. So, as the boys run a play action nickel with an audible, Miller ends up going down and declines to get back up. Ross sets aside his notations of scrotal tenacity to rush out and provide aid. But after missing the spider when it casually saunters out of the helmet, they\xe2\x80\x99re left holding their own scrotes wondering what the hell happened. We learn later that this series of events has earned Ross the unfortunate moniker Dr. Death. Lamenting the recent misfortune brought upon them by his upstart rival, Metcalf decides to relax by slipping his slender hog into the comforting warmth of his loafers, but gets bit. He is immediately thrown into a sizeable seizure, providing the key bit of evidence he would need to try to crack this thing wide open - except he\xe2\x80\x99s DOA. However, with him now out of the way, Ross is able to convince the county coroner to perform an autopsy. Although as the town\xe2\x80\x99s new physician by default, Ross barely has a chance to follow up on it. When complete, the coroner does confirm a minute amount of an unidentified toxin was found in Metcalf\xe2\x80\x99s system. With something to go on, Ross calls for some exhumations to gather additional evidence. In the meantime, he does warn the family to be wary of the dangers of spiders and the importance of steering clear of those you see. He then does research into the night, and falls victim to a rabid cricket attack - a lone survivor of the unseen spider-cricket war happening all around him. While he\xe2\x80\x99s busy diddling that one, a couple of boss spiders pull an egg sack into his cellar. His research leads him to Dr. Atherton - the top man on the west coast whose curiosity is piqued when the town named Canaima holds some vague recognition in the back of his mind. So he sends his assistant Collins to check it out, and he is lucky to arrive just in time for them to start examining some rotting corpses. Before he can step out for a quick puke, they find bite marks on each of the bodies. The next step would be quarantine, but this exceeds his authority, so he calls Dr. Atherton to confirm his expertise is required. The next day a crack team of arthropod enthusiasts enter Margaret\xe2\x80\x99s home to search out the culprit. With evidence that it\xe2\x80\x99s set up shop in the backyard, they know they\xe2\x80\x99re closing in. As they ponder this, Lloyd finds the prize in his cereal box. Since the preference would be to find a live one, they continue on and do eventually end up in a staring contest with the harbinger of their doom. Collins convinces Ross to run a distraction so he can nab it, as if it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have an abundance of eyes. But it does work. Meanwhile, at the Beechwood residence, the spiders are practically having a party as one uses the playful tickling of the water to blend in and descend Becky\xe2\x80\x99s torso. The end result is a post-puberty nightmare. They call in Delbert for an emergency extraction of the pests and, upon running across one on the back deck, he finds this breed to be remarkably impervious to the typical spray formula. But he always has the boot as a back up. Del then saunters off like a true badass. Atherton finally shows up and learns that Ross has connected the dots for him between the excursion in Venezuela and Manley the photographer, who was a resident of their town. They then inspect the specimen\xe2\x80\x99s triple sacks and test its venom, which has an alarmingly immediate effect. Atherton then lays it all out - these dickless soldiers are part of a highly organized colony, the likes of which have only been seen in the Venezuelan sample. It\xe2\x80\x99s an apex species led by a general dickslanger that, in this environment, is no longer bound by geography. If the queen is able to finish a breeding cycle, the outcome will be a whole host of child-bearing offspring that will look to expand out to new territory, so game over. They presume the point of origin to be the mortuary where the casket was received. And, since Irv has the phone off the hook, they posse up. We find Irv in a social media blackout so he and his wife can enjoy Wheel of Fortune - a tradition that severely dates this movie. Along the way, Collins discusses the ideal nest location I like the cut of your jib, my friend Where do I sign up? But, by the time they arrive, the Kendall's have been sucked dry. When Atherton goes to leave the office, Molly\xe2\x80\x99s photography sets him off in a different direction. He and Lloyd roll up to the barn and, luckily, he brought a jar so they should be all good. Atherton sends Lloyd off to fetch the others. Except after failing to find the nest, they\xe2\x80\x99ve already figured out the correct location based on the radius of initial victims. As they drive in that direction, Delbert points out that the barn is not ideal for a nest. But he\xe2\x80\x99s casting his pearls before swine as they dismiss his valuable input. Back at the barn, Atherton bafflingly enters the den and rings the dinner bell, ultimately reaping what he sows. Then the trio arrives and Delbert uncorks his private stock of insecticide, made of his own formula that proves to be fairly caustic. He employs it as the others go to check the house. Ross ventures in real slow and quiet like, creeping out his family in the process. Then they find a real good reason to be creeped out, and are forced to take to the stairs to hide. Unfortunately, doors are essentially useless in this scenario as their assailants file in through every crack and crevice, looking to find warmth in all of their cracks and crevices. As they exit, Ross delays too long, forcing him back into the house. Delbert tries to work his way in from the outside as Ross takes the elevator down. Unfortunately he pressed the button for the basement rather than the lobby. Now every itch feels like spiders to him, but the area is actually relatively arachnid-free - due to the presence of the queen, of course. He attempts to excuse himself, but is relentlessly pursued. Despite the size differential, he can barely do more than flaccidly swat at her. But then she surprises him into scream-tossing his shovel into the breaker box. He then searches for and finds the egg sack, which is pulsating in a rhythmically seductive way. He goes to innocently burn it to a crisp when the General rears his ugly head. Ross ends up stuck under what must be a full ten to fifteen pounds of wine rack, but he manages to get out somehow and chases him down with a makeshift flamethrower - and dammit if he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t start having some fun with it. He listens acutely for any movement, and readies himself. But is not ready enough. In the ensuing struggle he ends up supine with that hairy bitch crawling up his leg, reverting him to a baby-like state in which he is frozen in fear. He uses a wayward stick to catapult the General across the room, and then pulls off a lucky nail gun shot that sends him into the nest - annihilating the entire species - a truly sad story. As we close the movie, we find this all to have been an indictment of country living as they happily settle back into their San Francisco apartment, never addressing the question of how they\xe2\x80\x99re going to raise their kids in the city. And then nature gets the last laugh. That was an effective and harrowing horror movie, despite the attempts to lighten the tone. I would love to know in the comments if you can think of any horror movie that has since presented such a specific and simple threat as effectively. As we now move to examine the most practical strategies for survival, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to first acknowledge the ways in which different types of people may respond to this type of scenario in very different ways. To do that, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to take a moment to review the impact evolution has on some of our responses to specific dangers. Deep down somewhere in the depths of our brains, possibly in the pre-primate portions, lurks a natural instinct to avoid sudden and unexpected dangers. It\xe2\x80\x99s what helps animals survive in the wilderness and, in certain cases, it is most effectively employed in the avoidance of very specific hazards. As an illustrative example, let's take a moment to enjoy the feline involuntary response to an unexpected cucumber. The sudden appearance invokes a deeply ingrained response cats have learned to exhibit when presented with serpentine threats. I have my own anecdotal experience of a similar type. Once, after returning home from a road trip, I was walking by my rental car when some slender little finger-like legs started reaching out from the wheel well. I caught this only out of the corner of my eye and instantly jumped sideways away from the car. When I looked over, I saw that a praying mantis had hitched a ride from somewhere and was now checking out its new environment. The thing is, as soon as I saw what it was, all the adrenaline and anxiety that had instantaneously gripped me had washed away. There was something instinctual, specifically about the spider possibility, that prompted an automatic response from my body. This is something to consider as we discuss our options, but is also important to acknowledge in that it\xe2\x80\x99s exhibited behaviorally in the movie. One of the lovers of high school football practice had an instinctual response to spider presence without ever even seeing it. Collins does point out, when he\xe2\x80\x99s trying to convince Ross to help him, that we have a particular neural transmitter designed to help us move past the fear, but it also seems a healthy dose of fear is a benefit in terms of survival. This is somewhat confirmed by Ross defeating the queen by way of an impulsive fear response. In addition, it should be noted that the converse could get you in more trouble as those among us who are disinclined to fear spiders also seem more likely to want to give them a hug and cuddle instead, which is not recommended in this case. Considering that, let\xe2\x80\x99s take a look at a few key points of interest here. Now, the obvious first step is to decline to go where one doesn\xe2\x80\x99t belong or bring things that don\xe2\x80\x99t belong back to other areas. The problem is that Dr. Atherton, as is likely the case with many scholars looking to make a name for themselves in their field, is just too thirsty for knowledge and the prestige that comes with novel discovery. This is not balanced sufficiently with a similarly robust reverence for the destructive power of nature. As an example, as you go to seek out your tpui, if the locals are unwilling to go to a place, you should probably avoid those places. Or, at the very least, you could inquire as to what legends or folklore have caused them to take their current position to get a better idea of what you\xe2\x80\x99re walking into. Because, it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly not the butterflies that are the problem here. This is further compounded with the method by which they gather their samples. The departure of their guide is accentuated when Manley sticks his face in a web of a sufficient size to require taking a pause and a consult before moving forward. Despite this they do what they came for and greedily collect their precious samples in a way that demonstrates a wanton disregard for the sanctity of nature. You really are asking for it when you drop a fat deuce on mother earth...figuratively, it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty much impossible to avoid literally deucing on the earth, and in many ways is actually, very helpful. But that\xe2\x80\x99s just a cautionary tale. Most of us are not going to the Venezuelan rainforest, nor are we returning with unregistered biological material. So, we should really be focusing our energies on what to do in a domestic situation in which a threat currently exists. The first, obvious answer, if you live in the sort of area with sizable spiders, is to keep your eyes open at all times. Sometimes the upper corners of rooms do surprise us, because we\xe2\x80\x99re used to having a central focus at eye level or below. But it\xe2\x80\x99s always a good idea to take a glance about to verify what\xe2\x80\x99s lurking just outside your field of view. This would have been of great benefit in the shower especially where the water source itself was engulfed in webbing. As paranoid as checking everywhere for spiders all the time may seem, it\xe2\x80\x99s doubly important in this scenario, because you\xe2\x80\x99re going to be removing your clothes. Aside from the easy access to biteable areas, having a large insect on your naked body only ensures some deep, emotional scars to go along with any physical injuries you may sustain. There are also a variety of simple, daily preparations like shaking out your clothes before putting them on, and storing your shoes upside down. But then, if an engagement is unavoidable, you have to engage in the correct way. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t actually bother me at all that insecticides don\xe2\x80\x99t work, because I don\xe2\x80\x99t really abide by poisons. If you put out some rat poison, or spray a cockroach with some severe chemical that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work, then you just have a chemical coated, angry insect residing with you in some hidden location, tracking it\xe2\x80\x99s nasty chemicals all over or, especially bad in the case of the rat, dying later in a hidden location you can\xe2\x80\x99t get to. Now you\xe2\x80\x99re living in filth. No, once you go in, it\xe2\x80\x99s time to go all in. Of course, the goal is still to minimize the risk of physical contact. Because it\xe2\x80\x99s equally awkward to injure but not kill some large crawly thing that then runs off somewhere hidden to plot its revenge. Who hasn\xe2\x80\x99t ended a standoff with an encyclopedia, only to return sometime later to clean up and find no bug carcass underneath. That\xe2\x80\x99s terrifying. As an example we\xe2\x80\x99ll review the strategy Ross used against the coat hook shadow in his bedroom at night. This is a safe one, because it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t actually a giant spider, so we don\xe2\x80\x99t have to worry. Now, if you even suspect a spider of anywhere near this size, why do you have a rolled up magazine? The primary goal should be to kill it in a way that pins it to its location to ensure it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t skitter away or circle back on you, but from a sufficient distance that you have time for a second chance should you fail in the first. There is a proportional relationship between the size and danger of the insect in question and how long your device should be. In this case, I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking a closet rod...possibly the backside of an emptied drawer from your dresser. The key is to be creative, and few things promote innovative problem solving like fear of death. Using a shorter melee weapon could be okay in some scenarios, like using the towel against the horde at the end. In this case, you\xe2\x80\x99re alive through sheer luck anyway. You\xe2\x80\x99re not facing down an individual enemy lying in wait and intending to kill it, you\xe2\x80\x99re just trying to keep them away from your skin. Although, this rule would still apply if you intend to capture rather than kill, like during the face off. This bitch is staring directly into your face and matching your movement. A wine glass is insufficient in that it requires you to get too close to realistically secure a successful capture. Really we\xe2\x80\x99re establishing the importance of keeping an appropriate distance. Your enemy is smaller and quicker. You are going to want to leave yourself some lead time to get out of its way and avoid it. For instance, after all Ross had been through, was he so full of himself, so confident in his own abilities, that he would search for the General by putting his face up to the various places he thought it might be hiding? Who among us, when tracking a large, bug surprise, would get their face this close to where you suspect the bug may be? This is ludicrous. Moving one level higher, there are broader concerns at play here. Aside from managing the 1v1, you still have to come up with viable strategies for taking down the brood as a whole. Luckily, due to the short life span of the sexless soldiers, this mostly revolves around finding the nest and ensuring the queen doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get a chance to mate, which happens to be one of my specialties. The first step is to not enter the barn. If you do, certainly don\xe2\x80\x99t go into the midst of their feeding den. The threat is somewhat known, but somewhat unknown. Why prompt it to come to you rather than pursue it after ascertaining its location? What was the plan here? He knows the soldiers are fast and quick to bite, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve rarely seen a man more pink and delicious than Atherton here. You stay back and stick together. Approach the house quickly if there are no signs of danger and make your intent known to the family immediately. Call them to you and usher them away. Be wary, but don\xe2\x80\x99t hesitate, and there is no reason to seek out individual spiders here. The main goal is safety and containment. This is why the most obvious final solution is fire. If you\xe2\x80\x99ve ever seen the clock spider picture, my initial instinct when confronted with that is to deliver a hatchet to the thorax, then douse the place and light a match. You simply can\xe2\x80\x99t live there anymore. I know it\xe2\x80\x99s hard when you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about all your earthly possessions, but the situation really does call for fire applied liberally and indiscriminately. If you want to be ready to repel your spider overlords, you have to be prepared to walk away at a moment\xe2\x80\x99s notice. It\xe2\x80\x99s like Heat, except if Bobby De Niro were referring to a real-life prepared response to a spider infestation. If you do happen to find yourself in the depths and going toe-to-toe, this may be the one point where having an unreasonable affinity toward spiders could become beneficial. Because this point is exactly where you would want to have the courage to begin hugging. Hugging aggressively for the sake of salvation.
