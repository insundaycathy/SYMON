Welcome to Cinema Summary ladies and gentlemen. Now, what would you do if you could wish for anything your heart desired and it would be brought to you? We\xe2\x80\x99ll be exploring what can happen in such a situation and the consequences that can apply. This is The Room (2019). So the movie starts off with Kate and her husband, Matt, moving in to their new home in Springwell, Upstate New York: its a real fixer upper that has a mysterious wall blocked off. While cleaning up the kitchen, Kate finds a colorful if dead bird, which is just one of many weird items that are in the house like this key that Matt finds. After Matt finishes removing the barricade, he notices something weird with the wall and after scratching off wallpaper he finds a secret door with a weird lock. and after putting together a key, Matt unlocks the door and together with Kate, go inside. Though after walking in, the lights start flickering which gets Matt to call the power company. and the next day, the power guy comes and is shown a mysterious machine beneath the house weird cables and wires seem to emerge from it. It's a weird thing that as the power guy puts it is \xe2\x80\x9cOlder than his grandma\xe2\x80\x9d that he has never seen before in his life After looking it over and just before leaving, the power guy reveals to Matt that the previous owners got killed in the house. Something neither Kate nor Matt knew and so he does some research on the Springwell House Murders and finds that 2 tenants: a married couple were found murdered and the murderer was caught but his identity was unknown. That night, Matt makes a sketch of the killer\xe2\x80\x99s portrait and is drawn to the room once more. As he finishes his bottle of spirits, he glumly wishes for another one. Then there\xe2\x80\x99s a hum, a power outage, and when the power comes on, like magic, a bottle of the same spirits he was drinking appears: full, and unopened. So the next day is a day of debauchery for the two of them as Matt demonstrates the wish fulfilling properties of the Room to Kate and the two of them go predictably hog wild with wishes. and the morning after, Kate does some thinking outside, and as she's out there Matt notices that a necklace that was wished for is missing from her neck. It\xe2\x80\x99s then that Matt decides to surprise her with a room: a baby\xe2\x80\x99s room and asks for one more try and Kate isn\xe2\x80\x99t too sure about this. Since they had some difficulty in the past, having tried twice to no success with both times ending in losing the baby. It was a traumatic experience and Kate is not willing to try again. Matt goes off for a drive and when he gets back he finds Kate with a baby. and they get into a spat: Matt is upset with Kate since sure he wanted a kid but not through the power of a wish they could\xe2\x80\x99ve done this the \xe2\x80\x98right\xe2\x80\x99 way and now that she\xe2\x80\x99s done this they need to make this right and get rid of it. So, the duo go back to the wishing room as the baby cries and whines for mama and the rooms lights flicker erratically. Matt demands she wishes for the baby\xe2\x80\x99s to disappear before trying to make the wish himself but he can\xe2\x80\x99t do it either. So, they\xe2\x80\x99re stuck with this baby. Later, as he sits in his studio, Matt\xe2\x80\x99s eyes are drawn to the portrait he sketched of the Springwell House killer. He does some more research and looking at a newspaper clipping of the suspect he reads a quote that say \xe2\x80\x9cThe Room made me do it\xe2\x80\x9d. Finding out that the killer was also institutionalized for the rest of his life at a mental hospital. Under the name John Doe After grabbing some money, Matt heads to the hospital of the killer and asks to visit the man Face-to-face, Matt meets John who knows that Matt\xe2\x80\x99s been living in The House and knows its wish granting properties before warning Matt to get out NOW or else bad things might happen. After leaving the hospital, Matt goes to get his car refueled and finds out that the money from the house turned to dust. He then has a horrible realization and rushes home to test his hypothesis and the results are in: painting, money, or what have you: whatever part leaves the threshold of the house will age at an accelerated rate, turning into dust. It\xe2\x80\x99s much later that Matt goes around The Room, beating it with a hammer and finds wires hidden in the walls leading from the machine downstairs. Further investigation leads to him finding similar lengths of wires and cables as well as a strange diagram that bears some resemblance to a circuit board or maybe a magic sigil. That\xe2\x80\x99s when Kate decides to take the baby out for some fresh air, and Matt tries to tell her it\xe2\x80\x99s a bad idea without explaining why and she predictably takes the baby out leading to it aging. It almost dies but Matt decides to help save the child which has now become a young boy. Kate confronts Matt about his knowledge of the house and explains as well as he can that the house is like a giant 3D printer that makes things can only survive within the limits of the house or else it ages to dust. Even a child will age because even "it" is a thing. Some time goes by and Shane, the house made child is older now and is eager to leave the house much to his mother\xe2\x80\x99s consternation. Kate and Matt having restricted him to the house due to his \xe2\x80\x98sickness\xe2\x80\x99 kind of like that other movie, Eli. Of course this restriction makes him bitter especially towards his mother who has taken a much larger role in his life as opposed to Matt: whose become a shut-in, studying the house, trying to figure it out and having ordered a pistol for reasons we don\xe2\x80\x99t know. It\xe2\x80\x99s after Shane attempts to leave the house that Kate takes drastic measures in restraining her son: boarding up windows from the outside. Shane gets curious about himself after hearing his mom and dad talking about him and how he is a figment. It\xe2\x80\x99s the mystery of himself and the house that drives him to investigate The Room. The next day, the parents realize someone\xe2\x80\x99s been making wishes and when they enter the room they find that it\xe2\x80\x99s changed into a forest where Shane has been making a snowman and the parents are of two minds: one positive and the other negative. Leading to Matt locking the room, taking apart the key and leaving it in his desk with his gun. This gets him in an argument with Kate about the dangers of Shane\xe2\x80\x99s wishes and his existence. and that\xe2\x80\x99s when John Doe calls the house, somehow, and John gets to chatting with Matt about his connection with the house as Kate listens in And something John talks about is that there is a way for creations of the house to survive outside: the creator must be destroyed by the creation. As for how he knows this: John Doe is a figment too, a house created lifeform whose parents sacrificed themselves for John\xe2\x80\x99s existence. Thus, Matt has 2 choices: kill Kate and save Shane, or kill Shane to save Kate. Kate drives off leaving Matt and Shane alone as she goes off to sacrifice herself only to stop at the last moment while Matt and Shane talk about Shane\xe2\x80\x99s status as a figment. and it\xe2\x80\x99s here that Matt reveals that Shane is a fake person. when Kate returns and things get heated between her and Matt as Shane spies on them. The next morning, he steals some keys and runs off. When Matt and Kate wake up the doors open and Shane is "found": older, taller, and yet still very much a child who has his dad\xe2\x80\x99s gun. Things happen as Kate is knocked to the ground while Matt and Shane fight and when she wakes up, Matt\xe2\x80\x99s there and tells her that Shane\xe2\x80\x99s dead and buried outside. But then we see Matt on the floor desperately trying to find Kate. After he realizes that the lights are flickering and the Room is locked he makes himself an entrance to find her. As for Kate, she just can\xe2\x80\x99t stay here anymore and wants out of the house but Matt is pretty okay with just staying here and that\xe2\x80\x99s when he does a few things that the REAL Matt wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do. Something that Kate notices As for the real Matt , he crawls through the wires of the house before he breaks on through to the other side. Back with Kate, she knocks Shane-pretending-to-be-Matt away after he makes a move on her and runs around the home away from Shane who knocks her down and does "something" to her. Only for Shane to leave her as Matt breaks into the fake house and comes in to rescue her, but as they try to leave the House Inside The Room, things become Escherian as Shane exerts control over the fake house. But the parents manage to trick Shane and make it back to the real house and trap Shane outside leading to his end. One month later: at a motel, Kate is in shock as she realizes she\xe2\x80\x99s pregnant and there\xe2\x80\x99s this long shot that lingers on her shocked reaction when all of a sudden the lamp in the room flickers. So that just happened but what does it mean? Nothing good, I assure you and to hammer in how bad this could be, let\xe2\x80\x99s walk in another person\xe2\x80\x99s shoes for a minute. Let\xe2\x80\x99s say you are a mother and you have had difficulties giving birth: having had a traumatic experience that has made you afraid of trying. Then a solution comes along that bypasses any trauma for the sake of an instantaneously granted wish: a child borne from no mother or father except for that of a magic house. You raise it, and then the child is magically aged up and takes the form of your husband, and impregnates you 1 month ago A month passes, your cycle is funny, you pee on a stick and it\xe2\x80\x99s positive. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to give you a few more seconds to digest what I\xe2\x80\x99ve just said, you done? Okay. So what I think happened was that Kate realizes that she is pregnant and that she is carrying her son\xe2\x80\x99s child. How exactly this would work since anything created by the house cannot exist outside without aging to dust? Well, remember how John Doe mentions that you the creator must be sacrificed in order for the Creation to live outside the house? Well, Shane passes on at the very end of the movie but not before the fertilization process finishes up inside of Kate as we saw Kate stay inside the house to keep Shane out. In order to, y\'know, "terminate" him So yeah, that\xe2\x80\x99s a rather icky thing to think about. Let's move on Then there\xe2\x80\x99s the lamp flickering in the motel room. This I believe is not the movie saying \xe2\x80\x9cThe Wish Granting Properties of the Room have moved" instead it\xe2\x80\x99s acting as a reminder for Kate Reminding her that she has not truly escaped the consequences of her wishes. Now let\xe2\x80\x99s briefly talk about the Wishing Room for a minute: it\xe2\x80\x99s a very enigmatic plot device of the film, that has little to no explanation for who made it, when it was made, or even why it was created although I think it can be easily reasoned out as to the why, y'know, to grant wishes But something to note is that it\xe2\x80\x99s ancient, probably as old as the house and probably created by the person who built the house in the first place considering how integrated the machine is within the walls of the house Now with that said, what was never elaborated on are the limitations of the wishing room: Kate and Matt wish for smallish things so to speak although we see that given a wish and the desire of something, you can literally transform the interior of the Wishing Room as we see in the case of Shane. now I am assuming that age and mindset affects the scale of a wish as we only see Shane doing things like making an entire forest inside of the room or transforming the interior of the fake house into an MC Escher painting. Though this is merely speculation on my part though it should be a factor that is considered but what do you guys think? Do you agree with what I\xe2\x80\x99ve said about the meaning of the ending? My thoughts on the Wishing Room? And if you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen it, what do you think of the movie? Let me know with a comment down below and with that said.
