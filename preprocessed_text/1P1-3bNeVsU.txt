Hey Guys, welcome back to our movie recap channel. Today, we will be reviewing a french movie from 1992, called \xe2\x80\x9cThe Lover\xe2\x80\x9d. In this movie, we will see how a 15 year old girl falls in love with a 32 year old chinese businessman. Due to the controversial plot of this movie, and the many adult scenes it has, the movie was banned in many countries. Please turn on subtitles, and spoilers ahead. At the start of the movie, we see a ferry preparing to leave for its destination. The ferry is packed with the locals, and among them is Jane, the main character of the movie. She is a 15 year old french school girl from a remote village in Vietnam. Her mother is a school teacher in that village. And she has two brothers. Her elder brother Pierre is the bully of the house. He acts like the head of the house and he has his younger brother in control. Paul is just the opposite of Pierre. He easily gets intimidated by Pierre and is scared of him. Jane lives in a school hostel in Saigon, and was there to spend the holidays with her family. But, due to Pierre, Jane isn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly happy. She doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like him bullying Paul, and screams at him. Jane\xe2\x80\x99s mother seeing the rude behavior of Pierre says nothing to him. Jane says that she only loves Pierre and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care about her and Paul. Her mother says she loves all of them equally, but Jane knows that she is lying. Despite running the school in the village, Jane\xe2\x80\x99s family are financially struggling. And Pierre being the eldest male of the house, does nothing. Instead, he steals money from his mother to smoke opium. Today was the last day of her vacation, and Jane is returning back to Saigon. Her mother hands her some money and bids her fare well. She gets to the ferry, and is waiting for it to leave. A vehicle of a rich man also boards the ferry, and then the ferry starts. The owner of the car starts looking at Jane from his car. He finds her beautiful. So, he steps out to get a clear look. His name is Tony, a rich chinese man. He steps forwards and goes near where Jane is. He offers her a cigarette. So, it shows that he clearly doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think that Jane is an underage girl. Jane kindly declines Tony\xe2\x80\x99s offer for a smoke. Tony tries to strike a conversation, but he gets no response from Jane. Then, he compliments Jane on her beauty, and this time Jane replies. Tony tells Jane that if she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mind, he can take her to Saigon in his car. Jane agrees to it. She leaves from the ferry, in Tony\xe2\x80\x99s car. In the car, Jane notices Tony\xe2\x80\x99s ring, and she is definitely intrigued by his wealth. Tony asks Jane about her age. Despite her being 15 years old, Jane lies about her age, and tells Tony that she is 17. Tony replies that he is 32. Jane tells him that she studies in a school in Saigon, but lives in a separate hostel. Tony tells her about his family. His mother died 10 years ago, and since her death, his father became sad and hasn\xe2\x80\x99t left the house. His father takes care of the business all from his bed. Tony says that he quite doesn\xe2\x80\x99t understand how his father could love his mother that much.  On their way, Tony tries to get close to her. He gently caresses her finger with his, and Jane doesn\xe2\x80\x99t stop him. Slowly, they hold each other\xe2\x80\x99s hand. They finally reach Saigon, and Tony\xe2\x80\x99s driver lets her off. Jane says Goodbye and then enters her hostel. At the hostel, she tells her friend about Tony driving her off to Saigon, but she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t reveal everything that happened between them. Next day, on her way to school, Jane notices Tony\xe2\x80\x99s car, and realizes that Tony was there to see her. She goes near to the car, and kisses Tony through the window. Jane then quickly enters the school. After her school, Jane starts to look around for Tony, but she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t find him. Then, one day, Tony is at her hostel. Jane gets ready and leaves with him in his car. They both look at each other but don\xe2\x80\x99t say a word. Tony takes her to a house, and tells her that this house was gifted to him by his father. Tony tells her that this house was used by rich chinese men for their mistresses. Tony tells Jane that he wants to be in a physical relationship with her, but he is also afraid that he will fall in love with her. Getting nervous, Tony says that they should leave. But, Jane insists that she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mind being his mistress. Then, not knowing about Jane\xe2\x80\x99s real age, Tony starts to get intimate with her. At night, Jane tells Tony about her wanting to be a writer. She tells him that she wants to write about her family. She also tells him that since the death of her father, her family has been struggling financially. Tony asks her if she came with him because of his money. Jane answers that she came with him, because she likes him. Tony takes Jane to dinner in an expensive restaurant. Jane seems extremely happy to be there. Tony grabs his wallet to pay the bill. He puts down a few bills of money, which Jane can\xe2\x80\x99t help but glance at. Looking at Jane\xe2\x80\x99s expression, Tony also cracks a smile.  During the dinner, Jane says, that her mother believes that once a girl loses her virginity, it\xe2\x80\x99s impossible for her to find a husband. Tony also replies that his father wouldn't allow him to marry anyone except of chinese women. Hearing this, Jane jokes that it is good, since she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like chinese men. But, that night, Jane thinks of Tony\xe2\x80\x99s words, and cries. After that day, Jane was always picked up by Tony\xe2\x80\x99s driver during her holiday, and she would go to meet Tony at his bachelor house. And their intimacy was growing stronger with every visit. One night, Tony tells Jane that his father wants him to marry the daughter of a rich chinese businessman. Jane asks him if he knows that woman. Tony replies that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know her at all. Jane acts like this doesn\xe2\x80\x99t concern her at all. Jane and Tony, both know that they can\xe2\x80\x99t be together for ever. So, they try not to take these things seriously. They\xe2\x80\x99re just focused on the physical relationship they have going on. One day, Jane returns to her house on vacation. But she came there in Tony\xe2\x80\x99s car. So, her mother interrogates her about who dropped her to their house. Jane replies that it was a rich friend that they don\xe2\x80\x99t know. But Jane\xe2\x80\x99s mother shows her a letter from her hostel, which says that she often spent nights outside the hostel. Jane doesn\xe2\x80\x99t say anything, and Pierre starts calling her names, and encourages his mother to hit her. But, her mother doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do and leaves. At the end of her vacation, Jane takes her family to meet Tony. Tony acts respectfully towards them, but they all seem disinterested in him. Tony begins to tell them about himself, but they\xe2\x80\x99re all just focused on eating. Jane is aware of all this, but she doesn't do or say anything, because she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want her family to know about her feelings for Tony. She wants her family to think that Tony was just a rich friend, and not someone she loved or slept with. After the dinner, Tony opens his wallet to pay the bill. Jane\xe2\x80\x99s mother is surprised by the amount of money that Tony has. They leave the restaurant and go to another place. Pierre starts a fight, but Tony keeps his composure and sits down. Meanwhile, Jane acts unfazed by the behavior of their family towards Tony. She even starts to dance with Paul, and Tony watches it with almost a tear falling down from his eyes. He realizes that Jane\xe2\x80\x99s family came to meet him only because of his money. He thinks that Jane too was involved with him, only because he was rich. Later that night, Tony takes Jane back to his bachelor house. Jane is nervous because of the way Tony was treated by her family. Tony comes close to her and slaps her. He thinks that Jane slept with him not because she liked him, but for his money. Tony starts to take his clothes off, and Jane just lies down without any emotion. That night was different from all the others they had previously spent together. Jane, to act like she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like him, asks Tony for some money. Tony takes some money out of his wallet, and throws it down. He seems frustrated by everything. Jane takes that money and gives it to her mother. Her mother then talks to the hostel warden, and asks her to let Jane leave the hostel anytime she wants. Jane\xe2\x80\x99s mother was doing it so Jane could go meet Tony and take more money from him. She thinks that Tony is just a rich friend of Jane. She doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know that Jane is sleeping with him. But soon enough, everyone at the school finds out about Jane and Tony. She becomes an outcast. One night, Tony is leaving to meet his father to talk about his marriage. Before leaving, he gives Jane the ring that belonged to his mother. Despite everything, he still had feelings for her. Tony goes to his father, and tells him that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to marry the girl that his father had arranged. He says that he is in love with Jane. But his father doesn\xe2\x80\x99t allow this idea, and tells him that he has to marry the girl that he has arranged. Tony goes to Jane and tells her about everything. He says that he loves her, but also cannot go against his father, because he is nothing without his father\xe2\x80\x99s money. Tony is in a dilemma, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do. But, Jane tells Tony that she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t love him. So, he should marry the girl that his father wants. Hearing this from Jane, Tony becomes sad. Jane takes Tony to their family property. She tells Tony that when her father died, her mother was lied to by land sellers, and was sold flood lands. That was how they became poor. Jane stays there thinking about the pain her mother might have suffered. And Tony shares her emotion, but there is a distance between them. The last night of their being together, Tony asks Jane to tell him that she only slept with him, because of his money. Jane repeats the exact words that Tony wants her to say. Tony wants her to say this to make it easier for him to forget her. Jane tries to get close to him. But Tony stops her and says that he is ashamed of himself for not being able to take Jane with him. He also says that he no longer wants to sleep with Jane, because she didn\xe2\x80\x99t love him. Next day, Jane goes to her house in Tony\xe2\x80\x99s car. Her mother and brother see the ring that Tony had given her. They ask her why Tony gave her such an expensive gift. Pierre says that Jane was probably sleeping with Tony, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why he gave that expensive ring to her. To avert their suspicion, Jane throws the ring and says that she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care about it. But Pierre doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe her at all. He slaps her and starts hitting her. Paul hears everything, but he is helpless and can\xe2\x80\x99t do anything. After seeing Pieere get violent, his mother sends him back to France, to join the war, to keep her other two children safe. But she is sad to see him go away, as she loved him the most. Few months later, Jane goes back to Tony\xe2\x80\x99s bachelor house, and finds him completely changed. He was lifeless, and spent his days smoking. Jane asks him when he was getting married. Tony replies that it was just days later. And when that day came, Jane went to see the marriage of Tony and his wife. Tony sees Jane, but he quickly averts his eyes. Jane gets sad as she sees Tony and his wife leave. Jane goes to her house. Her family is preparing to leave Vietnam. Her mother reveals that Tony had paid the debt that Pierre had made in Vietnam, and he also paid for their trip back to France. Before leaving for France, Jane goes back to Tony\xe2\x80\x99s bachelor house and sits there waiting for him. She hopes that Tony will come to see her one last time. She waits for hours, but Tony doesn\xe2\x80\x99t show up. So, she leaves the house without getting to meet Tony, and be with him for the last time. As Jane leaves Vietnam, she sees Tony\xe2\x80\x99s car sitting there, just like when they first met. Tony isn\xe2\x80\x99t visible, but she knows that he is watching her, and she is watching him too. As the ship started drifting away, she no longer could see Tony\xe2\x80\x99s car. Years go by, and one day, Jane receives a call from Tony. It has been years since their life was separated.
