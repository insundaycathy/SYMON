Story Recapped here. Today, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to explain a drama, romance, and sci-fi film called, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Giver.\xe2\x80\x9d Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care. After a calamity called The Ruin, society reorganized into literal black and white communities. The communities are ruled over by elders, including the Chief Elder. In order to maintain peace and harmony, anything that threatens unity was removed. This means that in this world, there is no such thing as skin color, race, or religion. Everyone is one and the same. Conflict, pain, and suffering were removed, but so were emotions, freedom, individuality, and joy. For the betterment of society, humans are forbidden to lie. Sexual desire and reproduction were prohibited and all humans were now being genetically engineered. Once a person comes into age, he or she will take their assigned place in the community. One day before the Graduation ceremony, 18-year-old Jonas rides his bike with his two best friends, Fiona and Asher, on their way to their last day volunteering at the Nurturing Center. Unlike his friends, Jonas feels scared and unsure of the path that he\xe2\x80\x99s going to be assigned to. He feels different from his friends and sometimes, he sees things like a color that only he can see. They arrive at the Nurturing Center where Jonas\xe2\x80\x99s assigned Father also works. His father is currently caring for an Uncertain newborn, a baby who hasn't been assigned to their family unit yet. The Uncertain newborn, named Gabriel, cries out but Fiona quickly soothes him as Jonas\xe2\x80\x99s Father coos his name. Jonas is concerned since knowing a newborn\xe2\x80\x99s name is against the rules but his Father reassures him that the sound of the name calms the baby. As his Father explains, Jonas looks over at Fiona and sees a tinge of red in her hair. He dismisses it and they continue with their work. At the end of the day, the trio walks to the fountain and does their little ritual of jumping through the mini waterfall. They talk about their impending Graduation and promise that no matter what roles are assigned to them, they will remain friends. Later that night, Jonas expresses his anxiety during Feelings time at dinner, a time when his Father, Mother, and little sister, Lily, talk about their day. His Mother reassures him that the elders are never wrong and that they\xe2\x80\x99ve been watching him since Jonas was a Newchild so they will pick the perfect role for him. This does nothing to help Jonas\xe2\x80\x99s anxiety. The next morning, the day to finally graduate arrives. The Chief Elder appears as a hologram and hosts the Graduation ceremony. The ceremony starts with the presentation of the Elders who have now retired and will be released to Elsewhere, a retirement home for members of the community. After that, newborns are assigned to their birth mothers, children at the age of nine are given a symbol of their developing independence and responsibility. Soon enough, Jonas and the other graduates join the stage where the elders will now assign them their roles in the community. Fiona is assigned as a Nurturer as predicted while Asher becomes a Drone Pilot. The elders, however, skip Jonas\xe2\x80\x99s number, until all the graduates have left the stage. The elders reassure the audience that this is not a mistake. They chose carefully this time because they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t afford another failure. Because of Jonas\xe2\x80\x99s intelligence, integrity, courage, and capacity to see beyond, he has chosen to be the next Receiver of Memory. After the ceremony, Jonas asks his Father what the Chief Elder meant by \xe2\x80\x9ccan\xe2\x80\x99t afford another failure,\xe2\x80\x9d but his Mother shuts down the conversation. In his bedroom, Jonas activates the chip to learn about his new role. As the next Receiver of Memory, it\xe2\x80\x99s his duty to report directly to the current Receiver of Memory. After his training, he is to return to his dwelling immediately. As of now, he is also exempt from rules governing rudeness and he can ask any question. Aside from his daily injection, he will not take any medication, especially ones that prohibit pain. He may not discuss his training with anyone and he will be permitted to lie. On his first day of training, Jonas wears his uniform, making him stick out from the rest, and rides his bike all the way to the Edge where a house stood. He enters the house and since he\xe2\x80\x99s the new Receiver of Memory, it makes the current one, the Giver. The Giver sits on his chair and makes Jonas sit across from him. All the humans in their communities have no memories of the ancient past except for one, the Receiver of Memory. When the elders need guidance on matters beyond their experience, they go to the Receiver of Memory who gives them wisdom. Now that Jonas is the new Receiver of Memory, it\xe2\x80\x99s his role as the Giver to share this history with him. Jonas spots a mark on the Giver\xe2\x80\x99s wrist as he moves closer towards him. The Giver sees the same mark on Jonas\xe2\x80\x99s wrist as he takes his hands in his. As their hands close together, Jonas is instantly transported into a new world that he has never seen before. It\xe2\x80\x99s very cold and he\xe2\x80\x99s surrounded by stuff that you call snow. He spots a sled and takes a ride on it until he stops at the edge of a house where a family is singing a Christmas song. Just then, Jonas is taken back to the Giver\xe2\x80\x99s room. The Giver tells him that he will remember the names and emotions in time. As they walk home, the Giver tells Jonas that he will learn that there is so much more to the world they currently live in. In the evening, Mother asks about his training and notices that there\xe2\x80\x99s something different about him. Their conversation is cut short when Father brings Gabriel to the house. He decided to bring him in to help him catch up on his development. Jonas spots the same mark on Gabriel\xe2\x80\x99s wrist and knows that this baby will be chosen too. The next day at training, they explore the concept of color. Jonas shares that the first color he saw was red in Fiona\xe2\x80\x99s hair while the Giver tells him that his first color was yellow. Jonas seeps into the memories again and sees a burst of colors in the sky. He\xe2\x80\x99s witnessing what\xe2\x80\x99s called a sunset. When he opens his eyes again, he begins to see the colors in the room. The more he learns about the colors, the more he will see them in this world. The elders decided to get rid of colors because it encouraged envy. As Jonas looks out the window, the mist clears up just a little and reveals a tree. They were told that there was nothing beyond the mist, but then again, they were told a lot of things. When morning comes, Fiona finds Jonas laying on the grass and watching the sky, but unlike him, Fiona can\xe2\x80\x99t see the colors that he can see. Asher finds them holding hands and invites them to the viewing point where they can watch the drones fly. At the viewing point, Asher tells them that he\xe2\x80\x99s seen Elsewhere. It\xe2\x80\x99s just a few farms and houses like the communities. What\xe2\x80\x99s peculiar is that he saw two huge rocks as if they\xe2\x80\x99re forming a triangle. The two then ask Jonas about his job. Instead of telling them, he shows them. Jonas grabs a tray and Fiona does the same. Asher backs out and goes back to his training. Meanwhile, Jonas and Fiona sit on their trays and push themselves down from the viewing point and into the grass below. They laugh as Jonas helps Fiona to her feet. The community radio reminds them that it\xe2\x80\x99s impolite to touch people outside their family unit. Meanwhile, the Chief Elder meets with the Giver and asks about Jonas\xe2\x80\x99s training. She informs him that Jonas was caught almost sharing his training with friends. The Giver tells her that this is inevitable and even he himself tried to share his training with his friends when he was younger. She warns him to not get carried away and to remember what happened to the last Receiver. He glares at her and tells her that the Receiver had a name. When they have their training for the day, the Giver gives several books for Jonas to read. A map slips out from one of the books. It\xe2\x80\x99s a map of their world with a large boundary called the Boundary of Memories. Jonas concludes that if one of them closes the boundaries, then all the memories of the world will be set free. The Giver then leads him to the basement and shows him a piano. He introduces him to music and the meaning of emotions. He then reveals to Jonas that the morning injections they take remove their ability to feel emotions. He grabs Jonas\xe2\x80\x99s hand and transports him into a new memory, this time a medieval wedding full of food, music, and dancing. When he wakes up, Jonas feels a range of emotions he\xe2\x80\x99s never felt before. When he goes home after training, he teaches Lily how to dance. His parents see them dancing and look disturbed. A hologram message from the Chief Elder interrupts their conversation. The rest of the family go out and start their day while Mother remains to talk to the Chief Elder. The Chief Elder expresses her concern if Jonas is being trained properly, but he reassures her that she is. He lies to her and tells her that they sit together and talk. As he goes out, he grabs an apple and uses it on the morning injection instead of his arm. When Jonas leaves, the Chief Elder warns his Mother to be more concerned about his son. Over the next few days, the Giver teaches Jonas about everything from the ancient world. He shares with him various memories from different people, cultures, and religions. He also tells him about the animals that they used to have. He shows him every global milestone and every important historical event from their past. Jonas feels entranced at what he\xe2\x80\x99s learning. Every day that he learns something, the more he wants to learn. He loves the old world because it feels more complete somehow. At one point, the Giver feels Jonas is ready to know pain. He holds his hand during a session and gives him a memory of some poachers killing an elephant. When Jonas wakes up, he finds himself crying. The Giver comforts him, reminding him that there are far more painful things to come. Later that night, Jonas can\xe2\x80\x99t sleep and instead comforts Gabriel in his cradle. He tells him about the animals and is able to show him by holding his wrist. At this moment, Jonas realizes that Gabriel might become the new Receiver of Memory. He watches Fiona from her window and dreams of her when he sleeps. In his dream, the two of them lock lips together. Jonas tells the Giver about his dream and learns that it\xe2\x80\x99s a combination of fantasy and reality. He explains to Jonas that what he feels for Fiona is the beginning of love, but the elders removed love as well as the other emotions. Jonas thinks about this as he rides his bike with Fiona the next day. She asks about his training but he feels hesitant to share. He also feels confused about his feelings for her. Later at home, he asks his family about the concept of love, but their explanations don\xe2\x80\x99t help at all. He tucks in Gabriel for the night and tells him that he loves him. He then shares a few happy memories with him before he goes to sleep. The next day when Jonas arrives for training, he finds the Giver on the floor. He rushes to help him but before the Giver could stop him, they hold hands and the memories begin flooding into Jonas. He\xe2\x80\x99s in the middle of a battlefield amidst a bloody battle. His friend lays next to him, bleeding from the chest. He fires his gun at the presumed enemy and kills her. When Jonas wakes up, he\xe2\x80\x99s horrified. He\xe2\x80\x99s never felt this emotion before. This is what they call pain, loss, and hurt. He runs away from the Giver who\xe2\x80\x99s telling him that he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t meant to see that for a few more years. But it\xe2\x80\x99s too late. Jonas wants nothing to do with these memories anymore. The situation takes the Giver back to Rosemary. She was the Receiver before Jonas. The Giver sees Rosemary in his own memories, crying as she walks away. Meanwhile, Jonas sees Asher on the community grounds. Asher finds him acting peculiar and watches his friend walk away. Jonas is in a haze as he looks at the children playing, unaware of the pain and loss he\xe2\x80\x99s feeling. Fiona approaches him and he finally caves in. He tells her that he\xe2\x80\x99s stopped taking his injections and wants to quit being a Receiver. He encourages her to stop her injections too and soon she\xe2\x80\x99ll know what he\xe2\x80\x99s talking about. Fiona thinks he\xe2\x80\x99s nuts and insists that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t quit his role. He then tells her to meet up with him tomorrow at the fountain. Jonas returns to the house at the Edge and finds the Giver in the basement watching a memory. The Giver finally tells Jonas about Rosemary, his daughter, and the Receiver before him. She was in training for just two months when she insisted that she was ready to take on the pain. He then showed her a memory of a mother losing her child. Unfortunately, the memory was too painful for her, and the next day, she went to the elders and asked to be released into Elsewhere. Jonas thinks that it couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be too bad if Rosemary was only living in Elsewhere, but the Giver gives him a dark look and shows him a hologram video of the people who were released that morning. Jonas looks at the video and sees his Father handling a baby from a set of twins. He takes the baby to a separate room and proceeds to inject it on the head. There can only be one of the same things and so twins are separated and the other one is released to Elsewhere. Jonas looks in horror as he watches the baby stop moving. The baby dies and his Father isn\xe2\x80\x99t even aware of what he\xe2\x80\x99s doing. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know that what he\xe2\x80\x99s giving the child is a lethal injection. The Giver tells Jonas that the humans don\xe2\x80\x99t grasp the concept of death because they\xe2\x80\x99ve never been introduced to it. It turns out, all the young and old people they were \xe2\x80\x9creleasing to Elsewhere\xe2\x80\x9d were being killed by lethal injection. Jonas is furious at the Giver and demands to know why they\xe2\x80\x99ve never done anything to stop this before. He tells Jonas that there\xe2\x80\x99s no point if these people can\xe2\x80\x99t feel. After training, he runs to the fountain and finds Fiona in pieces. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t take her morning injections and is now feeling overwhelmed. He holds her hands and asks her about her emotions. He then leans in and kisses her. They both feel a warm fuzzy feeling inside them. Jonas tells her that there is more to what they\xe2\x80\x99re living in, but Fiona leaves. When he gets home, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t join his family at dinner, deeply concerning his Mother. He asks where Gabriel is and it turns out that Gabriel has failed his test for maturity and will be released into Elsewhere. Despite his parents thinking this was a good thing, Jonas knows better. This is a death sentence. He packs his bag and escapes through his window only to be approached by Asher. Asher questions his peculiar behavior and stops him from escaping. He tries to barricade Jonas but he punches him out of the way. He then gets back on his bike and rides all the way to the Edge. When Jonas arrives, he seeks help from the Giver, who happily assists him. They form a plan together. Jonas will take Gabriel and travel to the boundary of memories so that all the memories of humanity will be free and the Giver will stay here and help guide the people whose memories have just been restored. He asks the Giver why he never did anything all these years if he had the map, but it turns out the Giver was just waiting for someone like Jonas to come along. Meanwhile, Jonas\xe2\x80\x99s Mother reports to the Chief Elder after Asher reported Jonas\xe2\x80\x99s escape to her. They bring up Jonas\xe2\x80\x99s activity from the past year and begin tracking him down. Back at the Edge, a hologram transmission announces that Jonas is missing and is being tracked down. The Giver hands him the map and gives him one last memory to give him courage. Jonas rides his bike to the Nurturing Center and approaches Fiona. He manages to convince her to take him to the restricted floor where Gabriel is being held together with the other Uncertains. Meanwhile, soldiers are already gathering outside the center. Jonas tells her that he\xe2\x80\x99s leaving the community tonight and taking Gabriel with him. He asks Fiona to join him but she refuses, saying that she just can\xe2\x80\x99t leave her family behind. He promises to come back for her and they share one last kiss. Jonas takes Gabriel as Fiona takes another cradle and lures the security away while he escapes. Jonas runs outside and steals one of the security motorcycles as Fiona is finally caught. He rides all the way to the Edge as more security chases him. As he\xe2\x80\x99s nearing the end of their property, he takes a deep breath and takes the plunge towards the unknown. He disappears into the mist and lands into unknown terrain below. Since the elders can\xe2\x80\x99t track him now, they take in Asher and Fiona for interrogation. Meanwhile, Jonas has reached the desert and is traveling at top speed towards the border. Back at the headquarters, the elders learn about Jonas\xe2\x80\x99s plans and arrest the Giver. The Giver wakes up in prison together with Fiona while the elders hold a Ceremony of Loss for Jonas to try and make up for his disappearance. The Chief Elder reveals to Asher that Jonas is likely still alive and assigns him a secret mission to track him down and get rid of him. Asher accepts the assignment but feels conflicting feelings since Jonas is his best friend. Beyond the mist, Jonas has now abandoned his motorcycle and has started walking. Just then, Asher\xe2\x80\x99s drone appears and he begs his friend to trust him and let them go. Jonas starts running but the drone\xe2\x80\x99s magnet pulls them up and away. Asher then flies the drone to a river and drops them. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have the heart to kill his friend and instead releases them into the water so that they could escape. He waits until he sees Jonas resurfaces from the water before flying away. The Chief Elder contacts Asher and for the first time in his life, Asher lies and tells him that Jonas is dead. Meanwhile, Jonas and Gabriel get out of the water and continue their journey towards the border. Despite wanting to give up hundreds of times, the memory of Fiona keeps Jonas going. He had to make it so that he could go back and rescue her. Meanwhile, Jonas\xe2\x80\x99s Mother takes Fiona out of her cell and has made the arrangements for her release to Elsewhere. Fiona tells Mother that she now understands what Jonas has been talking about. She\xe2\x80\x99s felt things she\xe2\x80\x99s never felt before and she knows there\xe2\x80\x99s so much more to the empty lives they\xe2\x80\x99ve been living. Back at the beyond, Jonas and Gabriel have reached the snowy mountains. They fight against the bitter cold as they find their way towards the borders. Jonas checks his map. The tower marking the border should be around here somewhere. As they continue their journey, Fiona is accompanied to the chamber room where she will be released. The Giver arrives at the other side of the room and joins the elders. He begs the elders to put a stop to this charade and to finally release the people from this prison. The Chief Elder retorts back saying that they\xe2\x80\x99re delusional if they think bringing back love can help them. Love can easily turn to passion and then passion into contempt and then murder. People are weak and selfish. Out of all the people, the Giver should know best that when people are given the power of choice, they always choose wrong. Meanwhile, Jonas wakes up in the midst of the snow, having collapsed from the cold, and cradles Gabriel in his arms. He sees the sled, just like in the memory, and climbs on it. They slide down the snowy hill and finally reach the tower indicating the border. They pass through the force field and millions of memories are released just as they\xe2\x80\x99re about to place the injection on Fiona. Jonas and Gabriel arrive at the house, feeling ecstatic to know that it\xe2\x80\x99s real. And in his heart, Jonas knows that Fiona is safe and they will see each other very soon.
