[Applause]. there you go. just relax. you got to go out there. lift the plane up. lift the plane. how? there's nothing to stand on. it's [ __ ] air. i don't know. no what so they could tell the world that we left the rest of them to [ __ ] die. don't die with them. let's go frenchy. forget it, man, she's [ __ ] over here. he came to wash up on shore. every passenger on board, presumed dead, said they didn't have to die. we arrived three minutes after the plane went down. but if they let us into the military, then this will never happen again. [Music] you have to complain with me like i have to know who you told about compounds. guys, you were running the v down near the noodle palace. well, heroin overdose. huey, right. your starlight's friend, he got you in here. you [ __ ] me. what you coming here? you try to talk to the video. i have a video. i have this video of the three of us. what do you want? you want a little bit of money? are you here for money? you ship boxes, label this polio vaccine, but they're not really polio vaccine, are they? they're compounded. so what they do is they take boxes full of that stuff and they ship it to hospitals all across the country. and apparently the latest one is going to the nicu at mercer hospital. i'm burned. what [ __ ] up, frenchy, how i don't know. oh, my god, jesus. my girlfriend died. what happened not too long ago. and i came here looking for a way to get out of the [ __ ] that i'm in right now. all right. [Music] has been shipping compound v to 53 hospitals across the country since 1971. so no hero was born, none of them. we got vote for child endangerment, drug trafficking and possibly the largest fraud in american [ __ ] history. then i think we may need to reconsider your position in the seven. and i think that firing an employee after she reported sexual assault on live tv might tank your stock price. my wife, becker, homeland director. not long after that, she came sat right here. that was eight years ago, and nobody seen a sense. either homeland that killed her or she killed herself, make a public apology. and you're going to be taking a sabbatical from the seven. she's a soldier. there's a flag with a two-headed snake on it. you're dating a terrorist. wait, why would vac give compound v to terrorists? because the only thing more dangerous than the terrorists is a soup terrorist. and the only way to fight it the [ __ ] are creating super villains. and maybe there's more of them. god knows how many. it killed her parents. they kidnapped her and her brother. she just wants to go back and get her brother out of there. her name is camiko. a train said that you have some information. skinny, white guy, british guy, boy, gorgeous. merry christmas. becca new senior director, you would you take over vat's twitter account? your brilliant wife here did all the work. also, one of the guys who killed translucent. wait, what? i mean the seven is down by two? and then it all started when you came along. say, hi baby boy. dad. oh, hey, hey, hey hugh. why is he here? he says, you're in some kind of kid. let him go. my place is burned. they got me. you really did come alone. i don't know what that [ __ ] is. no, you don't. so you don't mind if i do this? yo. what [ __ ] go. made a mistake. the [ __ ] that you did was on purpose. so who's worse? it was a few days after you met homelander at that christmas party. she was alone with him for three hours. not long after that, rebecca went missing and has remained so ever since. my name is mallory. i'm the person who can get you payback. you want to know about rebecca butcher. you went to stillwell about her because you knew that'd tip over the first domino. well, it led to me eight years ago. stillwell called me with quite an interesting challenge. she was pregnant with your child. we told her we'd deliver the baby safely in a secure location, but she had to sign an nda. couldn't tell anyone. she died on the tables, drowned in its mother's blood. you should have been raised in a home with a family who loved you, not in a cold lab with doctors. i'm the world's greatest superhero. you're my greatest failure. and then, deputy director, your family's gonna be okay. you have my word. no homeland. no homelander, we had a deal. everyone else is fair game. hey, freeze. [ __ ], we believe it's his super name. they have a suit terrorist. captain. i found this, but they've counterfeited this compound. v [ __ ] of yours. matters is they've got it, and there is only one company that has the product to fight back. look at humankind. run. a suit terrorist showing up exactly when we needed him to was pretty [ __ ] incredible coincidence i made him breaking into my home and threatening my child is gonna get you. homelander, always yes, i'll be searching for her. gun's weakness. you're his weakness. knees [ __ ] face the wall. [Music], ah, i think he's having a heart attack. huey, go or else you'll get caught. will you please take the baby upstairs? oh, because of your lovely wife. no more lies you [ __ ] promised me. what instead? i'm scared of of you. you can thank me for, uh, saving you some time later. but for now, you know who else rebecca, i'm your father. we are a family. you
