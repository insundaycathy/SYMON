Welcome to Cinema Summary, ladies and gentlemen and get ready to log some flight hours, as one maverick pilot feels the need for speed as he flies to become the cream of the crop. And that's all the flight puns I have today so Strap in and get ready for the danger zone because this is Top Gun In the \xe2\x80\x9cPresent Day\xe2\x80\x9d an unknown aircraft is flying up in the clouds as Pilots: Maverick and Goose &amp; Cougar are up in their fighter jets, on the intercept for a bogey with a red star. It\xe2\x80\x99s a mystery that is quickly revealed to be MiGs: Russian jet fighters in Indian Ocean airspace. A tense game of chicken commences as the American jets scare off the Russian but one of the Rooskies is on Cougar\xe2\x80\x99s tail. So Goose and Maverick scare off the Rooskies with some fancy flying, Cougar has a mental breakdown in the cockpit and when all the flyboys land back on the carrier, Cougar is called in talk to his commanding and officer turns in his wings. He\xe2\x80\x99s out. But on the other hand Goose and Maverick (a very apt name for a pilot) head into the office and are sent to Topgun, Naval Fighter Weapons School in Miramar, California. It\xe2\x80\x99s here where the pilots are taught dogfighting and where we\xe2\x80\x99re introduced to Commander Mike who entices the pilots with dreams of being the best at Topgun And to say that Maverick wants to be top dog at Topgun is an understatement. Something that Ice Man is amused by. Goose and Maverick go to a bar that night where we learn more about Ice Man He's an ice cold pilot, whose never nervous and he's the best of the best. After some unresolved tension with Iceman, Maverick finds a chick he takes an interest in. Charlotte Blackwood or 'Charlie' and he tries to charm her but she shoots him down hard. But the next day at the academy, Charlie arrives at Topgun to talk about American and Russian jets more specifically how American jets can\xe2\x80\x99t do a negative G Push maneuver, something that Maverick argues can be done since he did it earlier. In the first training exercise, Maverick &amp; Goose train with Jester, an instructor in a fast plane, and after pulling a daring maneuver Maverick gets missile lock on Jester (succeeding the exercise albeit with a little bit of cheating). On their way back to the hard deck, Maverick decides to have a little fun and buzzes the tower and he gets chewed out for it by their commander. The next day, Charlie runs into Maverick and sets up a date. Next thing you know: Shirtless volleyball, not a lady in sight. Reminds me of what Tarantino once said about Topgun. It is a story about a man's struggle with his own homosexuality, it is! That's what Topgun is about man Uhhhh more on that later in the comments Anyways! Maverick heads to Charlie\xe2\x80\x99s house and they talk about Maverick\xe2\x80\x99s history and his experience against MiG fighters. On their next training exercise, Goose and Maverick are backed up by their wingman Hollywood. Up against Viper and Jester. Maverick spots Viper and chases after him to engage, no longer backing up Hollywood. Which ends with Maverick getting \xe2\x80\x98tagged\xe2\x80\x99 in the exercise \xe2\x80\x93 failing it. After a shower, Viper tells Maverick that he was impressed by his flying, but Maverick shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have abandoned his wingman lest he get screwed over. Something that Ice Man makes a point to emphasize. The next exercise that Maverick is in has him flying against Ice Man, in a competition to prove they are top dogs: chasing after jets and trying to shoot them down though while in pursuit, Ice Man pulls away and Maverick gets stuck in a jet wash causing his plane to go out of control and he has to eject along with Goose. But this ends tragically as Goose dies on accident and Maverick is traumatized. His guilt is made worse when at a board of inquiry, Maverick is cleared of any wrongdoing and at his next training exercise he chokes in the cockpit and decides to quit. After a talk with Charlie and Commander Viper, Maverick has renewed confidence in himself and goes to the Topgun graduation ceremony where he and all of the other pilots are given their assignments. A high stakes emergency: a live fire engagement with MiG hostiles in oceanic waters serving as air support. For this assignment Maverick is partnered with Merlin serving as support to Ice Man &amp; Hollywood who are up in the air ready to engage the 2 enemy MiG\xe2\x80\x99s except: there aren\xe2\x80\x99t 2 planes, but 4 enemy bogies but as soon as the American pilots realize this, Hollywood spots a 5th plane. What happens next is this intense cat and mouse game with Hollywood getting blasted out of the sky by a MiG. And after some fancy flying and good chemistry between Maverick and Ice Man, they manage to take down 4 of the MIGs causing the Russians to run away. Maverick and Ice Man are heroes on their return and congratulate each other with the immortal line You\'re dangerous. You can be my wingman any time" "Bullsh**. You can be mine! *Kissy noises and laughter* and after the assignment, Maverick decides to become an instructor at Topgun Fastforward sometime later and Maverick reunites with Charlie and the film ends with 2 jets doing some sickass maneuvers. MURICA. That was Topgun ladies and gentlemen, I hope that prepped you for Topgun Maverick coming out in October.
