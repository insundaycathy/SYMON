[Music]. the Internet has been abuzz with rumors and speculation the past week following the reveal of the Titan Season Finale trailer. this trailer not only gave viewers our first glimpse at Batman, but it also apparently showed that the Caped Crusader had gone off the deep end and murdered his rogues gallery. there were cries of outrage from some diehard DC fans, whilst others absolutely love the new take. but the episode synopsis reveals that this may indeed be a bait and switch. the synopsis, which has just been released by DC states in the season finale trigons powers send dick into a dreamscape that begins with him living a happy domestic life, but soon takes him into a dark journey back to Gotham. it's pretty clearly highlights that this episode is therefore going to be a hallucination. and whilst we may get to see an even darker, dark night, it doesn't seem as if this will be permanent. I think this episode may take a similar style to the batman, the animated series, episode, perchance to dream. in that episode, Batman was captured by the Mad Hatter and put in a machine that made him believe he was living out his perfect life. eventually things went dark though, and Batman had to face himself in order to escape. obviously, I can see many fans getting annoyed by this new synopsis, while some will probably love it. so make sure you let me know below which side of the fence you fall on and why. if you enjoyed this video, then please like it and check out my breakdown of this week's other big DC property, Aquaman, which will be linked at the end. this is the channel for people who are super into superheroes. so if that's the kind of thing you like, hit subscribe. thanks again for taking the time to watch this.
