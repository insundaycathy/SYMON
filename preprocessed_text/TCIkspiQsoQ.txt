refuses and leaves. claire tells vicki everything and asks for her help. she tells claire to get into noah's house and find the tape herself. noah follows what he thinks is claire's car, only to see vicky. he turns his car around, prompting vicky to call claire just as she is breaking into noah's house. she finds the camera hidden behind a clock above the fireplace. she walks into the basement and finds hundreds of pictures of herself all over the walls. claire looks into noah's laptop and finds the video in picture files. she trashes all of it, and then spots two other files with pictures of breaks, implying that noah was the one who cut the brakes out of garrett's car as well as from a minivan. claire goes back upstairs and is startled when noah's uncle shows up. she runs back home.

which opens up and drops out vicki's dead body. noah slashed her throat. claire screams and runs out of the house. she calls the police, right as noah finds her and pulls her out of the car. she tells him she knows he killed his parents. noah says that he loved his mother, but she killed herself after his father cheated on her, and he cut the brakes of the minivan to kill his father and the mistress. noah takes claire to a barn house where he has both garrett and kevin tied up. noah threatens to kill them both unless claire agrees to stay with him. she grabs a wrench and whacks him with it. she runs over to kevin and tries to untie him, until noah gets up and pulls claire away. he grabs some kerosene and throws it all around garrett and kevin. he takes out the lighter, when claire

a block of wood, and noah pushes him off. he aims his gun at kevin and says that sometimes heroes need to make difficult choices. claire calls noah and says, you're no hero, before pulling a switch that drops an engine on noah to finally kill him. claire and kevin pull garrett up and walk out of the burning barn house. the paramedics and police arrive on the scene. they wheel garrett into the ambulance with claire and kevin riding by his side. she continues to assure garrett everything will be okay and that they're finally going home. thanks for watching. please like, subscribe and click
