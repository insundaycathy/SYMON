\xef\xbb\xbfIn part 1 we witnessed dumb and dumber get trapped in a crawl space by alligators with a category 5 hurricane arriving. Haley tried to get her phone to call 911 and got snapped up in the process. In part 2 we will see if we can escape the crawl space alive, and beat the gator-icane in, Crawl. I want to backtrack a bit because I forgot to riff on this in the past video, but the fact that it\xe2\x80\x99s a common myth to zig zag when being chased by an alligator is bad and definitely not an effective strategy at all.  Yah, they can course correct way faster than a human. Your only advantage is your top speed and endurance. You need to get out of their short attack range as fast as possible, and zig zagging just slows you down.  Okay, where were we. Ah, yes, Haley\xe2\x80\x99s leg is stuck inside a 1 ton alligator's mouth and is getting thrashed around like Dicaprio in The Revenant.  Speaking of the bear attack in the Revenant, which would you guys rather get killed by, a bear, or a gator? I\xe2\x80\x99m inclined to say a bear, because I'd rather die to a majestic animal than a swamp monster, but Joe Rogan said that bears are likely to just pin you down and eat you while you\xe2\x80\x99re alive. Getting chomped on and drowned by death roll would suck, but at least the gator wants you dead as soon as possible. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, tough choice.  Haley stomping its eyes instead of floundering like fish out of water makes me want to up her score back to a 5/10, but she shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have put herself in this position in the first place, so nah. The gator releases it\xe2\x80\x99s grasp and she manages to hobble off on her certainly broken leg, only to get cornered by another 1 ton beast.  What the hell are they feeding these things? Somehow shoving rodent traps over their heads is an effective strategy and foils the gator\xe2\x80\x99s ambush. While they are distracted she makes her getaway by crawling headfirst into a web of cables. I know it\xe2\x80\x99s a stressful situation and all, but she easily could have low crawled underneath the cables instead of right into them.  Just when the gator is about to take a chunk out of her she breaks free.  What is the other alligator doing, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell me it\xe2\x80\x99s still banging its head against the wall trying to get the squirrel trap off.  Haley is running out of options, but stumbles past a screwdriver her dad lost when he was attacked, and did what he obviously didn\xe2\x80\x99t do, stab it in the eye.  This buys her enough time to slip into a crawl space within the crawl space, where the now pissed off alligator can\xe2\x80\x99t get to her. Well, was going for the phone worth it? I\xe2\x80\x99m telling ya, you should have just broken the wood floor above you and hopped out. If you\xe2\x80\x99d just listen to me, I could save you a lot of pain and tragedy.  Roughly translated, it\xe2\x80\x99s saying, \xe2\x80\x9ccome on out bitch, try that again and see what happens.\xe2\x80\x9d  Haley uses this breathing room to assess her leg situation. Can you imagine getting viciously attacked, narrowly escaping, and then because you\xe2\x80\x99re so pumped on adrenaline pain-killers that you literally have no idea how bad your injuries are. Logically, you know you got absolutely mangled. It could be a couple bite holes in your leg, or your leg could be hanging on by a thin piece of flesh. But you have to remove your clothing to know for sure. It\xe2\x80\x99s actually not that bad all things considered, but she\xe2\x80\x99s definitely not keeping that swimming scholarship. Thanks Dad.  Haley tries to stunt the bleeding by applying a makeshift tourniquet. If you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen my other video, you\xe2\x80\x99d already know she\xe2\x80\x99s going about it all wrong.  You should only apply tourniquets if the bleeding is extreme and unable to be stopped by direct pressure. What\xe2\x80\x99s extreme? When your description begins with, holy shit, that\xe2\x80\x99s a ton of blood. A good example is the medic in Saving Private Ryan.  God it hurts to remember that scene. Yes, Haley\xe2\x80\x99s bleeding a fair bit, it\xe2\x80\x99s not like she got a papercut, but I wouldn't say it\xe2\x80\x99s a holy shit that\xe2\x80\x99s a ton of blood type of situation. She needs to uncover the full extent of her injuries by ripping and removing the clothing surrounding the wound, and checking all around it. You don\xe2\x80\x99t want to find out that the warm puddle of water you\xe2\x80\x99re sitting in, it\xe2\x80\x99s not water.  Judging by the color of the blood with the flashlight on it, and how it\xe2\x80\x99s slowly pouring out, I'd say it\xe2\x80\x99s a cut vein. Possibly the subsartorial vein. Venous bleeding is easier to stop because it has lower pressures, and should only need 10-15 minutes of direct pressure. Once she controls the bleeding, she\xe2\x80\x99ll need to dress the wound. If the wound bleeds through the first dressing, she needs to apply another on top. If the wound bleeds through the second dressing, only then should she consider alternative options to stop the bleeding, like applying a tourniquet around her thigh.  Haley mistakenly thinks that her bleeding can\xe2\x80\x99t be controlled by direct pressure, so she rips off some thin cloth from her tactical capris pants and ties it around her leg.  Couple problems here. She\xe2\x80\x99s using way too thin of a material, she would be better served by ripping a large enough piece of clothing that she could fold into something 1.5-2 inches in thickness. The cord from her capris is too thin and will cause localized nerve damage. If she had any chance of saving her leg and that swimming scholarship, it\xe2\x80\x99s gone now.  Her placement is decent. It should be 2 inches above the wounded area because severed veins or arteries can contract further up into the body.  The next problem is that she ties it up like it\xe2\x80\x99s a shoelace. She needs to use that screwdriver as a windlass to crank the tourniquet tight. If it\xe2\x80\x99s not tight enough, it either won\xe2\x80\x99t stop the bleeding, or it can actually increase the blood loss.  The remaining problem is that she didn\xe2\x80\x99t record when she put the tourniquet on, which doctors need to safely treat her, when, or at the rate things are going, if she gets out.  They probably only have a couple of hours maximum before this crawl space and the roads are completely flooded, making escaping near impossible. Even a few feet of water will severely impair their ability to move around and use weapons. Which are really the only two advantages they have right now. Their window for survival is rapidly closing. They need to break through the ceiling with the shovel, or run for the basement entrance using the shovel to fend the gators off. Especially with more gators showing up to the party.  Instead of breaking through the ceiling with the shovel, big brains is using it as a crutch to scoot around. Where he\xe2\x80\x99s going, I don\xe2\x80\x99t even think he knows. How he\xe2\x80\x99s not in excruciating pain by now, I have no clue. Initially I could understand his confusion as he might have been in shock. But he\xe2\x80\x99s fairly calm and lucid. The pain should be overwhelming by now.  Not to mention all the bacteria in his open wound from the gator teeth, and the disgusting sewer water. Dave will be lucky to keep his leg at this point, Haley too with that shitty tourniquet.  Haley wants to go to the front of the house to try to call for help, which is confusing because her phone is destroyed, everyone has evacuated already, and your voice won\xe2\x80\x99t carry at all in this hurricane. She\xe2\x80\x99s just risking her life for no reason again.  Meanwhile, Dave kicks his broken leg up onto a wall and tries to cinch his tibia back into his leg with the toolbelt. Sigh.  1. This should have been done a long time ago, preferably with Haley\xe2\x80\x99s help in the safe area. I could understand why she didn\xe2\x80\x99t check and treat his leg initially, because it was more important to get them out of the dangerous area first. That and she had no first aid or medical training. 2. If you\xe2\x80\x99re an incompentent moron like Dave, you should not be setting the broken bone. Trying to squeeze your jagged exposed tibia back into your leg could cause more internal damage and bleeding by severing arteries, muscles, ligaments, and tendons. It\xe2\x80\x99s also going to be obscenely painful and you\xe2\x80\x99ll likely pass out trying, and with gators preying on you, now\xe2\x80\x99s not a good time to pass out.  3. Using a toolbelt as a splint is an order of magnitude dumber than Haley using essentially a shoelace as a tourniquet and attempting to cut circulation off of her femoral artery by looping the left bunny ear around the right bunny ear and pulling it tight. He needs to find two \xe2\x80\x98rigid\xe2\x80\x99 objects that are long enough to stabilize both joints above and below the fracture point. So his ankle and knee. He could unscrew or break off some pipes, or dare I say, pop off the wood planks above him, then use his shirt and belt to tie them around his leg. The whole point of the splint is to immobilize the joints and wound, so using a leather toolbelt has got to be the worst thing you could choose.  Haley gets to the porous brick wall and see\xe2\x80\x99s some people in a boarded up gas station 50 yards away, and proceeds to yell help, as if they could hear her. They couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have heard you even if there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a hurricane. It\xe2\x80\x99d be more effective to strobe your flashlight, which she does, and surprisingly it gets the looters attention. Too bad it\xe2\x80\x99s a full on gator-pocalypse now.  I\xe2\x80\x99m beginning to think that these are not normal alligators. The most plausible explanation is that a nearby gator farm owner was running experiments, and breeding them for intelligence and aggression. That or they installed Neuralink brain machine interfaces to control the alligators so they could murder their annoying neighbor, Dave, without suspicion.  Or they were just hungry gators from a flooded farm that should have had higher fences.  The ATM, I get. What I don\xe2\x80\x99t get is risking your life for a couple three day old cold hotdogs and 2 dollar sunglasses. I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure I brought enough Darwin awards to hand out to everyone.  Haley, taking her dad\xe2\x80\x99s shitty advice once again, tries to make it to some access hatch location, supposedly it\xe2\x80\x99s another way out of the crawl space. Except it\xe2\x80\x99s blocked. Wonder what dumbass put a bunch of heavy boxes right on top of it.  Maybe, for the millionth time, break the wood planks or pry them off with the screwdriver or piece of metal nearby. I know it\xe2\x80\x99s not as easy as simply judo chopping a hole in the floor, but you\xe2\x80\x99d think being at the precipice of death would ignite the required ferociousness necessary to break down walls. If she could break to the topside, she could grab Sugar and call off this rescue mission. Dave doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need your help, remember. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he can hobble out of there himself with his toolbelt splint slash tourniquet. She has already sunk a lot of sacrifice into his extraction, so she might as well see it through. She should make it to the first floor, have him yell, find his location, then use the tools by the sink, in the garage, or from his truck to break the wood floor above him, then pull him out.  Judging by the rate of water flowing in, and the radio saying the levees would likely break soon, they will drown if they don\xe2\x80\x99t figure this out soon.  Beth\xe2\x80\x99s ex-boyfriend fling shows up to check on Dave after all.  It\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing he didn\xe2\x80\x99t only visit his condo, but also the old escrowed house.  This fling really knows a lot about this family for supposedly just being a fling. I\xe2\x80\x99m sensing some stalker vibes here. While Wayne is trying to rescue two wounded survivors before the storm surge hits, Wayne\xe2\x80\x99s partner takes up the important task of checking out the mysterious swingset that's getting tugged on by something in the floodwaters.  I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure why the swingset is so captivating to him, literally any random object could be pulling against it. It\xe2\x80\x99s also inadvisable to be walking around in the floodwaters because there could be potholes, downed power lines, sharp objects, fast moving objects in the current..  ...and hungry alligators.  Again, realistically speaking this would be extremely unlikely. But, it is possible, which is why you want to keep your hands and feet inside the boat at all times.  Wayne finds the two bozos and radio\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s left of his partner to grab the snare pole and help him fish the gators out. In this fictional world with gators this strong and aggressive, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think a snare pole is a viable option. Where would they even put the gator once they snare it. Outside? It could easily swim back over. And with flood waters rapidly rising they really don\xe2\x80\x99t have time to waste playing let\xe2\x80\x99s go fishing. Wayne just needs to just break up the wood floor above them so they can get the fuck out ASAP.  Go Haley! Wayne getting mauled is the perfect distraction for you to make your escape. He\xe2\x80\x99s putting up quite the fight too, so you should have plenty of time to swim to the exit. I know i\xe2\x80\x99m going to get shit for saying this, but he really is a lost cause.  Haley opts to use Wayne\xe2\x80\x99s brutal death to make a break for her dad. I honestly don\xe2\x80\x99t know where anything is in this maze. I know it\xe2\x80\x99s Haley\xe2\x80\x99s childhood house, so maybe she has a better sense of direction, but still, it seems like you could easily get turned around and find yourself in a dead end. Especially since you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t actually see where you were swimming in the dark murky sewage water. The second gator locks on to her and tries to chase her down, but it\xe2\x80\x99s no match for an average collegiate swimmer with clothes on and a shitty tourniquet applied around her severely wounded leg.  Maybe these gators have gotten fat and slow from having their blood diverted to digesting the cops and looters. It does take 2-3 days for gators to digest most prey. Not something I'd count on though. What a smart decision. She could have escaped the basement and saved both their lives. Now they both get to drown in each other's embrace. Just when all hope seems lost, Dave gives her a motivation talk about perseverance.  He says that when Haley was little, her sister Beth could make it the length of the pool on one breath, when Haley couldn\xe2\x80\x99t. And that night at 2:00 o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning he heard Haley outside in the pool trying to achieve a one-breath lap too. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that pretty dangerous, being in a pool by yourself as a kid, nobody around or awake, trying to see how long you can hold your breath underwater. Pretty sure that\xe2\x80\x99s how people drown.  As they say, if you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna be dumb, you gotta be tough. With all the heart to heart talks Dave\xe2\x80\x99s giving, you\xe2\x80\x99d think he would apologize or at least show some remorse for causing this entire disaster and getting multiple people killed. The latest strategy Dave devised is to bang on the pipes while Haley swims to the basement entrance. He seems to think that banging on the pipes earlier made the alligators angry or disoriented, and that doing so should buy her enough time to get past them. What evidence does he have for this? Absolutely nothing.  Alligators are tuned to pick up sensitive vibrations in the water, so banging on pipes could provide some light auditory cover for Haley. This plan doesn\xe2\x80\x99t account for alligators being primarily vision-based hunters. You can bang on the pipes all you want, but if they spot her, she\xe2\x80\x99s dead. The other problem with the pipe banging tactic, is that it will draw the alligators right to him. I still have no clue where they are now, but he should go to that blocked off safe area before banging on the pipes.  Let\xe2\x80\x99s say that breaking through to the ceiling wasn\xe2\x80\x99t possible, what should they do. I do think that hatch that Haley tried to open is still their best. It\xe2\x80\x99s a potential escape point and blocked off from gators. If both of them can make it there, I'm sure they could force it open.  If not, then well, yah trying to create some form of diversion or distraction while someone goes for the entrance is the best you can hope for. Haley could use the shovel to sever Dave\xe2\x80\x99s lower leg off completely, then use that as bait while they swim for the stairs. Sorry Dave, but I think you need to take one for the team. Haley mistakenly listens to her dad, yet again, and attempts to outswim the alligators. Dave also mistakenly doesn\xe2\x80\x99t go to the blocked off area before banging on the pipes, and draws the attention of the second gator. I don\xe2\x80\x99t see how either of them will realistically survive this, but they do have immense strong plot armor.  No way he could have seen the gator coming, been able to initiate the trap with any certainty, timed it correctly, nor guarantee that the trap would actually injure it or hold it down. Barry got extremely lucky here.  The gator is still a threat, so he starts bashing it\xe2\x80\x99s head with a brick. Alligator hides are super thick and dense, especially on these 800 pound monsters, so unsurprisingly this doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work. Dave then tries shoveling it.  In the movie he lodges it in the brain stem of the gator, but I\xe2\x80\x99m also skeptical of the effectiveness of a shovel against an alligator. Daves in a confined space, severely injured, and trying to swing a full length shovel at a thrashing gator that\xe2\x80\x99s underwater. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he\xe2\x80\x99d be able to project enough force to break through the hide and kill the gator.  At this point, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t really have any other options other than to fight like hell with what he had. But that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly the problem, they didn\xe2\x80\x99t need to let it get to this point. If you go rock climbing without a harness and get tired halfway up the cliff face, you\xe2\x80\x99re fucked. The solution would have been to rope up in the first place.  Haley makes it to the stairs, but one of the gators is still there so she decides to one up her dad\xe2\x80\x99s shitty plan by diving through the drainpipe to make it outside. The drain pipe which leads to the floodwaters outside where Wayne\xe2\x80\x99s partner and all the looters got massacred, and which the gators have been using to go in and out of their house. Seems like a bad idea. Someone needs to tell Haley that we are apex predators because of our superior brains and intellect, not because some of us are decent swimmers. Do they have a lagoon under their house, where the hell is this and why does it exist? I\xe2\x80\x99m sure Haley isn\xe2\x80\x99t putting 2 and 2 together here, but the abundance of rotting corpses is strongly indicative of an alligator nest. This is like their food cabinet. Haley basically pulled a Liam Neeson in the movie The Grey where he was trying to flee from the wolves, but accidentally trekked right into their den.  Woops. I know Haley and Dave don\xe2\x80\x99t really have an option here, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine how bad the infections will be from ingesting, swimming in, and bathing their severe open wounds in this disgusting water filled with rotting carcasses, feces, mold, rats, and god knows what else. That is, if they somehow survive long enough to get to a hospital, which doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem likely. Mama gator doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look too happy about you fucking around in her nest. One of the corpses has a pistol on it, so she snags it and pulls the trigger on where she thinks the alligator is.  The only thing louder than a bang when you need it, is a click. She must have known her way around guns because most people would just freak out and not be able to fix the problem.  She recognized that the gun had a failure to fire when it presented an audible click. This means the slide was locked forward and the firing pin dropped fully, indicating that the issue was either a bad round or an empty chamber. The solution in this case is called a tap rack bang. Tap the base of the magazine to ensure it is fully seated. Rack the slide to get a fresh round in the chamber, and the bang part should be obvious.  The gator absolutely ate those 13 rounds. Shame it also swallowed the Glock too. Could\xe2\x80\x99ve been useful later on. I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure if those gunshots would scare or attract more gators. Best to keep moving. Haley makes it to the drain pipe which will probably lead her into a more dangerous situation.  Man, none of this would have happened if the drain pipe had a proper covering on it. Why was it even broken like this. Haley\xe2\x80\x99s got lungs of steel, but a couple air bubbles tickle the gator and alerts it to her presence. Let me guess, she outswims it. Yep. I still wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t feel safe at all being on land. Gators are still fast and deadly out of the water, especially these fictional ones.  Haley tries to wave down a helicopter while Dave is sucking his last breath out of the floorboards. At the rate of water flow, the helicopter wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be able to provide help in time, even if it could spot you. Getting your dad out before he drowns should be the first priority..  If the water gets any higher, he won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to let Haley know where he is under the floorboards. Sugar\xe2\x80\x99s like, hey idiot grab the crowbar and break the wood up, which i\xe2\x80\x99ve been barking at you to do this whole time. \xe2\x80\xa6 It literally was that easy. A couple seconds of hitting the planks and they shattered into pieces. Fucking hell guys. All this devastation could have easily been avoided.  Dave already drowned, so hopefully Haley knows CPR. Done correctly, CPR has a 90% resuscitation rate for people who recently drowned and were removed from the water.  Haley, isn\xe2\x80\x99t doing them correctly. Her compressions are far too fast and shallow, and she should be doing 30 of them between breaths. There\xe2\x80\x99s not enough pressure to circulate his blood, His head is tilted back with his chin up, and she is pinching his nose and providing respiration, but she isn\xe2\x80\x99t providing 2 one second breaths and watching for his chest rising. Her weak breaths won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to force enough oxygen into his lungs. Of course when she gives up and beats on him like a drum he wakes up.  Now that Dave\xe2\x80\x99s conscious again, you need to get to the roof, a gator could make it through that hole and snatch you like Wayne. The flood waters are also rising rapidly so escaping by vehicle won\xe2\x80\x99t be an option.  What.. Haley you just swam out of waist high flood waters. You\xe2\x80\x99ve witnessed looters and cops using boats. How is getting to the car even an option in your head. The apple doesn\xe2\x80\x99t fall too far from the tree. This definitely is not a cat 5. If it was, they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be able to stand outside due to the wind speeds. They would literally take flight. Boats would not be an option. Helicopters would definitely not be an option. Hell, you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t even need to go outside to know it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t an option. The hurricane must have lost some steam at landfall, or they are nearing the eye of the storm.  Bad idea. One. the boat probably got damaged in the attack. Two, they\xe2\x80\x99d have to cross a huge distance to get to it. Three, wading through floodwaters is dangerous for reasons I've already mentioned in this video. Four, you won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to control the boat against the currents. Lastly, and obviously, because there\xe2\x80\x99s a handful of aggressive hungry alligators which have already slaughtered numerous people. Sure, the levee\xe2\x80\x99s may break and your home might get wiped out, but that\xe2\x80\x99s a small chance given the low category rating of this hurricane. The overwhelming priority should be getting as far from the gators as possible.  Even if you did want to use a boat, I'd try to find the patrol boat and untangle it\xe2\x80\x99s propeller, or just use the boat that\xe2\x80\x99s in your garage. I\xe2\x80\x99m about to give up here. No splashing, no hunting? You think you can just tiptoe 50 plus yards past a bunch of hunting alligators in the debris filled floodwaters on a broken leg that isn\xe2\x80\x99t properly splinted, while holding a dog when as you said, the levee is about to break and an immense storm surge is imminent.
