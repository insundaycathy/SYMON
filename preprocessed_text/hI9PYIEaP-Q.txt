\xef\xbb\xbfIf you woke up with Jigsaw telling you that you have seconds to find a key before you\xe2\x80\x99re butchered, what would you do? In this How to Beat video, we\xe2\x80\x99ll follow Amanda and Jigsaw\xe2\x80\x99s latest victims, see if we can make better decisions, and ultimately attempt to beat the Traps in Saw 3. Think you can do better, let us know in the comments! Enjoy these How to Beat videos, like and subscribe! Have a movie you\xe2\x80\x99d like me to cover, reply to this comment! If you haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen my videos on Saw 1 &amp; 2, go check it out to see how all of the pain and suffering in this sequel could have been prevented. Let\xe2\x80\x99s see if we can beat Jigsaw and his Traps, for the third time. We start out where Saw 2 left off, with Eric\xe2\x80\x99s impulsive decision making landing him in what\xe2\x80\x99s quickly becoming the most rancid bathroom on Earth. Eric doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a game here. On the cassette tape Amanda gave him, she says that he\xe2\x80\x99s a test subject for future games. This means that there\xe2\x80\x99s no playing along and winning anymore. She will be back soon to rig him up in a contraption to test it\xe2\x80\x99s lethality. Eric could wait and see if the police find him, but I'm not too confident in Detective Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s abilities. I think he\xe2\x80\x99s on his own. Amanda could be back in a couple hours, or a couple days. Either way, he needs to be ready to ambush her when she arrives. The gun lying next to him is unloaded, so he\xe2\x80\x99s going to have to do Amanda in the old fashioned way. He can\xe2\x80\x99t ambush her in his current shackled position, which really only leaves two options.  Amputation, or pulverizing his ankle bone into dust and slipping his wet noodle of a foot through the shackle. Tough to say which one is more preferable.  I think I\xe2\x80\x99d go with pulverizing my ankle for a number of reasons. Less chance of bleeding out. No need for a dangerous tourniquet that you might have to leave on for days. No horrible infection from using a rusty saw contaminated with the decaying rotten flesh from Lawrence\xe2\x80\x99s foot and Xavier\xe2\x80\x99s throat. Less chance of the old shitty saw breaking off midway into your ankle, and by only breaking your ankle, you could potentially keep your foot if you make it out of here alive.  Eric opts for amputation. He bites down on his shirt, lines the saw up on his ankle, but gets cold feet and rage throws one of the only ways to save himself across the room.  Realizing there\xe2\x80\x99s no other way, and that he absolutely has to get his leg free to save himself and Daniel, he grabs a nearby toilet cover and goes to town on his ankle.  Apparently Amanda left the door unlocked like an idiot, so Eric attempts his great escape. Amanda, did you not think that Eric would use the saw or find a way out of his shackle eventually?  He gets the drop on her and clubs her over the head, but instead of going for the kill he tries to interrogate her to find out where his son is.  I\xe2\x80\x99m going to go ahead and say that this was a bad call. Interrogating your enemy for answers only works when you are in a position of power and they have something to gain. Neither of these are the case. Eric\xe2\x80\x99s in an extremely vulnerable and weak state, and Amanda has little to gain by answering him. He\xe2\x80\x99d just kill her anyway. He should also know that Jigsaw\xe2\x80\x99s accomplices are fanactical, and won\xe2\x80\x99t be intimidated by threats. The only way this ends is with Amanda fighting him to the death. Eric should have buried his knife under her jaw the first chance he had, gotten to safety, and had the police conduct a thorough investigation of the building. Amanda uses this opportunity to kick out Eric\xe2\x80\x99s broken ankle and drag him back into captivity.  Since Eric failed his game and let Jigsaw go, his rampage continues uninhibited. A man named Troy wakes up in a chair with chains looped through his jaw, shoulders, arms, hips, heels, and hands. Each set of chains is pulling on him from all directions.  The TV turns on and Jigsaw lays out the game. On a desk right across from him there\xe2\x80\x99s a nail bomb with 1 minute and 30 seconds counting down on the timer. I know I'm supposed to be helping Troy here, but Jigsaw should have put the explosive on the other side of the jar if he wanted the nails to explode towards Troy. If we\xe2\x80\x99re being real here, the chains looped around his achilles and through his jaw are not coming out. There\xe2\x80\x99s no fucking way you are ripping your own jaw off. You\xe2\x80\x99d need crazy leverage and power to pull the tendons off the bone and to tear the flesh away completely so that it was fully free from your body. And that\xe2\x80\x99s even disregarding the fact that your brain is going to be actively shutting the procedure down.  If another person put their foot on your forehead, grabbed your lower jaw with both hands, and deadlifted it with all their might, I still don\xe2\x80\x99t think your jaw would come loose unless it\xe2\x80\x99s Brian Shaw or The Mountain. We\xe2\x80\x99ve established that escape is not an option. The only ways to survive now are to deflect and distance the blast or diffuse the bomb.  The other chains appear to be looped through the epidermal layer only, so ripping these ones out is plausible. With only the jaw and achilles loop remaining, he should be able to move forward and to the side enough to pull the bomb desk towards himself, or use his chair to pull it toward him. Then, he can grab the bomb.  Since this bomb looks homemade, it\xe2\x80\x99s probably a low enough yield that it could be survivable if he tossed it behind the teachers desk and barricaded himself behind some of the metal desks. Alternatively, he could pull the bomb off the nail jar, put it in a desk cubby, and throw the cubby across the room. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t try to throw it through the windows as there\xe2\x80\x99s a high chance of it bouncing off or getting caught by the blinds. You\xe2\x80\x99re going to be close to the bomb in an enclosed area, so you definitely want to have your mouth open when it goes off. By keeping your mouth open, you allow air to escape your lungs when the pressure wave hits you so your innards don\xe2\x80\x99t pop like a squeezed balloon. There is evidence that this bomb is survivable. When the police are investigating the crime scene, they pick up the burnt teddy bear that was attached to the bomb, as well as recover the functioning tape from the TV right across from it. This is still incredibly risky, so I would attempt to disarm the bomb first.  The bomb looks like an explosive compound with a timer serving as the electric detonator that triggers when the timer hits zero. It looks pretty crude, and I doubt Jigsaw would have anticipated someone trying to diffuse it and so they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have put in a secondary failsafe trigger. From the looks of it, simply removing the batteries on the front should remove the ability to generate a current. Of course, you\xe2\x80\x99d still want to throw it across the room just in case it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t fully disarmed. Troy doesn\xe2\x80\x99t try to disarm or deflect the bomb. He hastily starts tearing the chains out before assessing the situation, and makes good time, but inevitably can\xe2\x80\x99t budge the last ring through his jaw before the bomb goes off.  Later that night Kerry is reviewing Troy\xe2\x80\x99s tapes and all the evidence in her bedroom. Eric and Riggs weren\xe2\x80\x99t lying, Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s obsession has completely hollowed out her entire life. To be fair, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you can just switch it off after seeing everything she\xe2\x80\x99s seen, and after Jigsaw had abducted one of her detectives. It\xe2\x80\x99s not like she can just hit pause, pretend everything's fine, and go vacay in the Keyes to drunk karaoke \xe2\x80\x98Call Me Maybe\xe2\x80\x99 with her girlfriends. When the tape ends, the channel changes to a live video of Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom. The camera for it looks like it\xe2\x80\x99s coming from the closet. Kerry ain\xe2\x80\x99t fucking around, and blasts it with her service pistol she kept bedside. I gotta give her props for keeping a weapon on her at all times and not hesitating to send lead into the closet before she checked it out. She did only shoot high and center though. If you think Jigsaw\xe2\x80\x99s hiding in your closet, you fire high to low and left to right so you can hit them if they hit the deck or were hiding on one side of the closet. You could put a bullet in the center top if you played too much Splinter Cell and were extra paranoid. Kerry goes to clear the closet. Again, props for keeping her gun up and not stupidly holstering her weapon to check it out, like Eric did in the bathroom at the end of Saw 2. Still, this smells like a trap to me. I\xe2\x80\x99d back off and call 911.  Pigmask was smart not to hide in the closet anymore. That worked on Adam, but Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s way too on edge. Wait, where did pigmask even come from? There was literally nothing but a wall on that side of the room. Is Amanda also an apprentice of the Ozunu Ninja Assassin Clan?  Kerry wakes up in her worst nightmare. I hope you learned something from reviewing all these crime scenes and tapes. Okay, so the mission\xe2\x80\x99s clear. We have one minute to dunk our hand in a jar of highly corrosive acid to get a key which unlocks or disarms the trap, or we end up like a chestburster victim from Alien.  Looking around, there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing that you could use the key on that would disarm the contraption. The padlocks on the leather harness aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to halt it, and since it\xe2\x80\x99s hooked into her ribcage she can\xe2\x80\x99t just undo the harness and pop out.  If the acid isn\xe2\x80\x99t corrosive enough to disintegrate the key for an entire minute, there's no way it will melt through all the steel braided cables that will be pulling her ribcage apart. She could try to hold the metal wings closed with her arms and legs, but it would be futile. The hydraulics on this contraption will be far too powerful. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to go with there\xe2\x80\x99s no real way to beat this trap. This isn\xe2\x80\x99t a game, it\xe2\x80\x99s an execution.  Amanda walking in as Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s ribs took flight just proves that Kerry didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a shot. Amanda would never have let her live even if Kerry escaped the trap somehow.  The only way Kerry could have survived is by not getting caught in the first place, but since pigmask is apparently a phase-shifting ninja that can pass through walls without making a sound, she didn\xe2\x80\x99t stand a chance. Amanda and Jigsaw\xe2\x80\x99s next victim is Dr. Lynn. After rolling out of bed with her affair to save a dying kid, Amanda jumps her in the hospital locker room. Lynn then wakes up gagged and tied to a wheelchair in a trap factory. Compared to Jigsaw\xe2\x80\x99s other victims, she could have woken up in a lot worse of a situation. Amanda shows up with her takeout and wheels Lynn over to Jigsaw\xe2\x80\x99s homemade infirmary. Jigsaw\xe2\x80\x99s not looking too hot. His beatdown from Eric definitely didn\xe2\x80\x99t help the cancer.  Jigsaw tells her the 6 words no woman wants to hear.  The collar Amanda\xe2\x80\x99s placing around her neck is linked to Jigsaw\xe2\x80\x99s heart rate monitor. The second his heart rate flatlines, or she leaves this building, the collar will release the spring loaded hammers which will detonate the five shotgun shells directed towards her neck.  Lynn has to keep John alive until another victim on the monitor\xe2\x80\x99s outside completes their test. If the other victim completes all of their tests, and John still has a pulse, Amanda will remove her collar and she\xe2\x80\x99s free to go. There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of shit that can go wrong here.  Based on Lynn\xe2\x80\x99s ocular patdown of John, his condition is rapidly deteriorating and he could go at any time. This hospital isn\xe2\x80\x99t stocked with the necessary tools, medications, and trained personnel to keep him alive. Even with all this, John still might not be savable. The heart rate monitor could fail or the power could temporarily go out. There\xe2\x80\x99s a high probability the other contestant won\xe2\x80\x99t win their game. Amanda\xe2\x80\x99s coming across as emotional, unpredictable, and bloodthirsty. She can\xe2\x80\x99t be trusted to honor the rules of the game, and may kill Lynn anyways. Playing the game is too risky, so Lynn needs to find a way to disarm the collar and take them all out.  Straight up trying to kill Amanda for the collar\xe2\x80\x99s key is pretty risky. Amanda will be anticipating this and won\xe2\x80\x99t go down easy. Both her and John might have remote detonators for the collar too. Amanda see\xe2\x80\x99s Lynn thinking about this option and runs some reverse psychology. Bury the axe in the base of her skull right now. She won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to let a scream out if you do it right, and then you can grab the key, take the collar off, slit Jigsaw\xe2\x80\x99s throat, and save your husband who\xe2\x80\x99s on the monitors playing Jigsaw\xe2\x80\x99s metagame. Actually, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t trust the key to not activate the collar somehow. Amanda was a little too overt about putting it around her neck. Seems like bait. I would try to disarm it first. There\xe2\x80\x99s a number of ways this can be done.  Lynn could snag one of the electric bone saws, tell John she\xe2\x80\x99s taking a bathroom break and that Amanda\xe2\x80\x99s out shopping for medical supplies, then try to cut the collar off. It\xe2\x80\x99s a bit risky, as John will wise up and possibly remotely detonate her, or the procedure itself might set the trap off. The least risky method is to try to yank the shotgun shells out of their vices. Shotgun shells are made of plastic and could potentially be squished and jimmyed out. If the vices are too tight, she could use any one of the sharp objects in the building to cut open the ends of the shotgun shells and drain the shot pellets out. Even without the shot, there\xe2\x80\x99s a plastic wad inside the shell that separates the gunpowder from the shot itself. These wads get shot out too, and could easily penetrate her soft neck flesh. She\xe2\x80\x99d want to put something hard between her neck and the shells to stop the wads. Lynn could also use fabric and tape to cover the primers of the shells, or stuff the hammer slot which will jam it so it can\xe2\x80\x99t strike the primer. Lynn can\xe2\x80\x99t muster the courage to drop the axe on Amanda, and goes back to tending to Jigsaw. When she palpates his head, she concludes that his brain is herniating and will need to be decompressed with a risky surgical procedure. This is both good and bad news. The bad news, John could die and take her with him. The good news, Amanda needs to be sent off to go get crucial medical equipment. Amanda freaks out at this suggestion, and her tantrum causes John\xe2\x80\x99s condition to destabilize.  Again, good and bad. Bad, she almost got her head popped from 5 different directions. Good, because now Lynn\xe2\x80\x99s diagnosis was validated and Amanda can fuck off to go get her the supplies she needs.  With Amanda out shopping and Jigsaw pacified with some calming medication, Lynn can use the previously mentioned methods to disarm the shotgun collar, slit John\xe2\x80\x99s throat, and make a run for it. Lynn wastes this opportunity by prepping for John\xe2\x80\x99s surgery, and Amanda gets back with the supplies. Great, now she has to perform basement cranial surgery at gunpoint. Good going. Hopefully the other victim on the monitors can complete his test in a timely manner. No rush bro, but we\xe2\x80\x99re dead if you don\xe2\x80\x99t hustle up.  The man wakes up in a wooden crate with a cassette recorder next to him.  Jeff smashes out of the crate and finds a box with a picture of himself, a key, and a note saying \xe2\x80\x9copen the door, Jeff.\xe2\x80\x9d He wanders down the corridor and finds a door with the words, \xe2\x80\x98face your fears\xe2\x80\x99, painted on it. Hope you\xe2\x80\x99re ready for your first test. He opens the door and finds a bare woman strung up in the middle of the meat freezer. This ought to be good. The door behind him closes and locks him inside, so he won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to go back for any useful materials in the corridor.  Jeff tries the key on her padlock and the door, but they don\xe2\x80\x99t work. That would just be too easy. No, he\xe2\x80\x99s going to need to play the cassette tape to hear what Jigsaw has in store for him and this lovely lady. How the fuck did Jigsaw know this.  The nozzles start periodically spraying Danica with, I want to say water, but cold water wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t kill her that fast. Jeff needs to find a key behind those pipes, which means Danica has to be within seconds of death to up the pressure and intensity. I think she\xe2\x80\x99s getting hosed with liquid nitrogen, which means she\xe2\x80\x99s only got a couple spray sessions before she\xe2\x80\x99s iced up like Boris in GoldenEye. The most immediate thing he needs to do is get her out of the nozzle\xe2\x80\x99s spray zone while the sprayers are active. At her current hypothermic temp, that liquid nitrogen will start sticking and causing 2nd and 3rd degree frostbite almost immediately. Throwing your jacket around her might help a bit, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not as important as getting her out of the way. He could try to knot the hoses or cover them with his clothing, but I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a better option. He could either grab her body and pull her backwards, or if she has the strength, hoist her up onto the beam she\xe2\x80\x99s hanging from. Obviously, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a bit challenging, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not expecting her to pull some Riddick shit.  Two people working together and having her pull up while using his back as a stand might work. She did say she was so cold she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t feel her arms, so swinging her back sounds like the game plan. Once the sprayers turn off, he can go for the key. It\xe2\x80\x99s just out of arm\xe2\x80\x99s reach, so he\xe2\x80\x99s going to need to grab one of those meathooks in order to snag it. Or he can freeze his face off on the metal pole while stretching his arm out of its socket. Jeff wasted too much time deciding if wanted to forgive her, and misprioritized getting the key over keeping her out of the splash zone. This neglect was fatal, and Danica gets glassed before he can undo her shackles.  At least his failure to save Danica didn\xe2\x80\x99t end his game. Jeff leaves the meat freezer and finds another box with a bullet, a picture of his son, and a note that reads, \xe2\x80\x9cone bullet will end it all\xe2\x80\x9d.  There\xe2\x80\x99s another door labeled, \xe2\x80\x98time to let go\xe2\x80\x99 with a bicycle and the little Jigsaw doll reenacting what his son looked like after getting hit by a car. Savage.  Jeff pushes the door open which snaps some wires and locks the door behind him again. He should probably start putting some of those 2x4\xe2\x80\x99s in each doorway he comes across so he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t keep getting locked in. There\xe2\x80\x99s a vat with a man chained to the bottom of it with a cassette recorder dangling on the catwalk above.  Okay, so, berate the judge that let your son\xe2\x80\x99s murderer off the hook until his screams for mercy compel you to forgive him. Then incinerate some dolls, retrieve the key from the ashtray, and unlock his collar. Simple enough. What's the catch?  Ah. Well, technically Jeff has plenty of time. This trap is more about Jeff\xe2\x80\x99s mentality than anything. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you could sabotage the cow line somehow, or plug the gut soup\xe2\x80\x99s drain hole with something, but what\xe2\x80\x99s the point when all you need to do is push a button. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to let go of your recently deceased son\xe2\x80\x99s possessions, but eventually your survival instinct will overcome it.  Jeff does about as well as he can be expected to do in this trap, and saves the judges' life.  Meanwhile, Lynn is about to start Jigsaw\xe2\x80\x99s operation. Before she begins, Amanda walks in and tells John that the other contestant made it through his second test. That he was progressing faster than expected. Lynn has no idea how many more tests the other victim has to go through, or if they will succeed. I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure what\xe2\x80\x99s riskier, trying to stall the procedure and putting your faith in the other contestant, or performing basement surgery. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think Lynn has much of a choice. She gives John the local anesthetic, cuts his head skin off, squirts some alcohol onto his exposed skull to disinfect it, power drills some marker holes, and bonesaws out a square opening for the brain to expand into a bit.  Lynn\xe2\x80\x99s a hell of a surgeon for being able to do all this by herself with minimal equipment under the threat of decapitation. Everything seems to be going swell until John\xe2\x80\x99s heart rate starts plummeting. Nothing a little O2 can\xe2\x80\x99t fix. Amanda\xe2\x80\x99s pretty distressed by almost losing her father-figure, and runs off to do some therapy thigh-cutting. I\xe2\x80\x99m guessing Mr. Jigsaw doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know about all this. The operation was a success, John seems to be stable, and the other contestant is apparently making good progress. Lynn\xe2\x80\x99s sitting in a good spot, but she\xe2\x80\x99s not out of the woods yet. John\xe2\x80\x99s the only thing pumping the breaks on Amanda\xe2\x80\x99s psychotic murderous urges, and his condition is rapidly fading.  John\xe2\x80\x99s pretty much passed out right now, and with Amanda gone, Lynn needs to use these rare moments of isolation to jam the shotgun collar\xe2\x80\x99s hammers and swipe a scalpel she can run across Amanda\xe2\x80\x99s neck when she\xe2\x80\x99s not looking. Jeff approaches the last room\xe2\x80\x99s door. There\xe2\x80\x99s another box with a magazine to load his pistol round into, a picture of his daughter, and a note that says, \xe2\x80\x9cone step closer to your revenge.\xe2\x80\x9d Judge Halden gives him the tired ass spiel that revenge isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to bring his son back, only make his pain worse. Now, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t suffered immense loss and gotten cold-blooded revenge, so I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t know whether or not he\xe2\x80\x99s right. Obviously vengeance isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to bring his son back or fill the void within him, but it isn\xe2\x80\x99t pointless. Letting a murderer go relatively scot-free because punishing them won\xe2\x80\x99t bring your loved one back is a ridiculous assertion. You\xe2\x80\x99re just allowing bad behavior to run without consequence. I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying Jeff should paint a white skull on his shirt and start mercing degenerates or people that made terrible mistakes, but hopefully you get what i\xe2\x80\x99m saying. If some dickhead ran your kid over, got 3 months, and went on with their life like nothing happened, it\xe2\x80\x99s understandable that you\xe2\x80\x99d want more retribution. Jeff\xe2\x80\x99s final test of forgiveness kicks off when he busts the door open and finds Timothy, the drunk driver that killed his son, in a hell of a contraption. Jeff hit\xe2\x80\x99s play on the recorder.  That\xe2\x80\x99s a double barrel shotgun. Jeff\xe2\x80\x99s going to be taking a little more than a bullet when that thing fires. It\xe2\x80\x99s still somewhat unclear if letting Timothy die fails his game. I think he needs to get the key to leave this place either way. Based on the message, Timothy seemed like a man that just went down a bad path, and made a tragic mistake that he was sorry for. Jeff realizes that he can\xe2\x80\x99t let Timothy get murdered like this and heads over to the shotgun box to get the key. Timothy\xe2\x80\x99s running out of time though.  On the brightside for Jeff, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think little Timmy\xe2\x80\x99s gonna be driving drunk, let alone driving after this. Judge Halden is just standing around like a clueless moron yelling oh my god like a teenage girl. He should be attempting to jam the cogs with his clothing or belt, ripping out all the electrical wires he can find, and finding the location where Jeff should use the key to stop the machine.  So there\xe2\x80\x99s a key dangling in front of the barrel, actually, under the barrel, and it\xe2\x80\x99s held on by a little screw off mount. Shotguns, especially longer barrelled ones like this will have very concentrated spread for quite a distance. It\xe2\x80\x99s not like in the movies where a shotgun has a 2 foot spread at 7 yards. If Jeff pulled straight down or unscrewed the latch and took the key, the shot would fire over his hand. You just want to make sure that the judge isn\xe2\x80\x99t in the line of fire before grabbing it.  Or else that will happen. Judge Halden really should have been watching where he was stepping. He knew there was a shotgun that was going to fire when Jeff ripped the key off, maybe watch the fuck out? Jeff rushes over to Timothy and tries to find where the key needs to go to stop the twister, but it\xe2\x80\x99s too late.  Well, Jeff got the key and made an effort to forgive and save all the victims, so I think technically he won. Jigsaw see\xe2\x80\x99s that Jeff completed his tests, and instructs Amanda to remove Lynn\xe2\x80\x99s collar. As expected, Amanda goes full psycho bitch and refuses to play by the rules.
