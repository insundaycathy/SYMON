Welcome to Cinema Summary, ladies and gentlemen genetic engineering is a field of science and technology that could be so very beneficial for all mankind and even animals but what happens when it all goes terribly wrong? This is SPLICE (2009) So the movie starts off with us witnessing a birth from the first-person perspective and we meet our protagonists Clive Nicoli and Elsa Kast played by Adrian Brody and Sarah Polley respectively doctors who observe the fruits of their labor: Fred and Ginger; two genetically engineered life forms who seem to get along with each other much to the relief of their team these two doctors are superstars in the field of genetic engineering and they work for a company called it Newstead that conducts experimentation in the fields of genetics splicing in DNA from different species into a new life form of which Melvin and Ginger are the sum achievement of and that hopefully are going to be used to produce medicinal proteins for life stock with a more advanced splicing technique used for Fred; Clive and Elsa predict that they can use it on humans it's exciting since if applied a lot of incurable conditions like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's for example could be cured though they might have to hold their horses on human experimentation since the board of directors want to be able to replicate and eventually sell the proteins produced by Ginger and Fred without the use of genetic splicing labs which are going to be shut down and retooled since human experimentation will lead to scrutiny and bad publicity and bad publicity for the company it's a risk that the company can't take so the two continue in secret on their human DNA splicing experiments but they undergo failure after failure until they do it. At their apartment Elsa and Clive discuss moving places and even more about having children before they're interrupted by an alert they head down to the embryo to find it ready to come out and although a lot of things go wrong during this birthing sequence the human hybrid is born a birth that sits heavy for the both of them with Clive considering that they destroy it though Elsa insists that they keep it but Clive won't be dissuaded but when they go to it they find that it's dead and Clive goes out of the OR as Elsa stays to look at their hybrid only to discover that it's empty and is actually this weird chicken rat looking thing that "imprints" on Elsa they knock it out and begin to study it closely, finding out that it's able to excrete venom even though there was no predatory DNA although it's the DNA that's concerning since beyond random junk DNA and overall weirdness the hybrid is undergoing accelerated aging due to its genes and later that night Clive meets his Barlow a higher-up a Newstead who tells him straight out that everything is leaning on Phase 2 succeeding if they can't sell the medicinal proteins from the transgenics, Ginger and Fred, Newstead is going under and it's going to be on Clive and Else's heads if such a thing occurs a month passes and the hybrid child has grown immensely exhibiting a human-like intelligence and resembling a toddler of sorts. A toddler that Elsa dotes on and teaches much to Elsa's delight and Clive's worry since Elsa has been getting a little too into raising this child: letting the 'child' out of its containment area and taking the cover off the hybrid stinger and even going so far as to name it! Calling it "Dren" the word nerd spelled backwards It's this whimsical treatment of Dren that leads to an argument since this wing of the lab is going to be renovated so how are they going to hide their crime against nature? That's when Gavin, Clive's brother and lab associate, sneaks into the room to eavesdrop and find out more about the mysterious experiment that Clive and Elsa have been hiding and runs into Dren so now they got a deal with it their plan is genius, not really of course, but their plan is genius so to speak: sneak Dren out in a cardboard box keep her hidden within storage area which isn't great since Dredd has a really high fever so they put on a cold water bath which leads to Elsa freaking out and with little option and a little righteous indignation Clive holds Dren under the water and they find out that she has amphibious lungs. That night Elsa dotes and babies Dren giving the hybrid a Barbie doll that Elsa explains that she had to hide from a mother when she was younger a small tidbit of information that is going to explain Elsa psychology and her actions but there's still more to know though something to note is that Dren is significantly older now looking more human with an actual nose and as Elsa and Clive get freaky on a couch, Dren watches on with piqued curiosity The next day Clive and Elsa present Ginger and Fred to the public but things go horribly wrong as the two transgenics fight each other to the death knocking their container over and spilling blood quite literally in the aftermath of the presentation Clive and Elsa explained that Ginger transformed into a male of her species and they don't know how that happened with the renovation soon to be done, Dren is moved from the Newstead storage area to a farm that Alice's mother once owned, a mother who Elsa described as crazy, let's hope that doesn't run in the family though when they get to the farm Dren runs off after being taken outta the van to find some food and after setting up Dren's room in the barn the couple head into Elsa's old house and we get a very clear look into Elsa's pass Exhibit A: her old bedroom left just the way she had it before she left clear signs of abuse meanwhile Dren has been getting restless with only a cat for company with her parents gone for work and begins her rebellious phase which Elsa does not take well while Clive is surprisingly receptive being nicer than his crankier wife and so to keep Dren company Elsa stays home and gives Dren the things Elsa's mother wouldn't let her have like makeup and jewelry and when Elsa checks the makeup table she finds the portraits of Clive but none of her which gets Dren skittish running away to pet a cat which Elsa takes away snidely telling Dren you can't always get what you want that's a part of growing up when Clive returns he finds Dren heartbroken and tries to comfort her with a little music and dance which leads to Clive feeling things he shouldn't have since he has Elsa and then Clive has a sudden and horrid realization and confronts his wife about her decision to use her DNA in the experiment calling her out on her BS excuse to do the experiment out of some noble pursuit of science instead of what it actually is after Clive leaves Elsa gives a now older and taller Dren a gift that cat from earlier which Dren promptly punctures fatally with her stinger shocked Elsa smacks Dren which leads to her pouncing on to Elsa to steal the barn door keys to unlock the door and escape only to get knocked out and wake up strapped to an operating table where Elsa has gone back to being a scientist and separating herself from the experiment referring to Dren by her designation: H-50 and begins dehumanizing the hybrid removing Dren's clothes, jewelry, and makeup in due to Dren's violent behavior Elsa removes the hybrid's stinger when Clive arrives Elsa leaves taking with her the cutoff stinger back to the Newstead lab to find the proteins since by design Dren has everything that Fred and Ginger had which leads to Elsa synthesizing the protein Newstead's been looking for the next day Clive goes to the barn to find Elsa but is ambushed by Dren who comes on to him very aggressively and then things get freaky because not only are they doing it. Not only does Dren's stinger grow back but Elsa finds them! Coitus interruptus ensues and Elsa drives off back to their old apartment and there they have an argument which gets to the crux of the issues: Elsa only wanted to create a child instead of simply having a child because deep inside she never wanted to lose control of said child a side effect of her abusive childhood, plus with the whole creating life and raising it in humanely and treating it poorly they've crossed a lot of lines supposedly in the name of science and there's no going back but maybe they can put an end to all of this so they go back to the barn to find Dren is dying and so they bury her, burn her things and as Elsa is moving her things she finds drawings of herself and that's when company arrives Gavin and Barlow are here to see H-50 and that's when Dren comes back to life now as assuming a more masculine form and picks off the men on the farm: First Barlow then Gavin and finally Clive before Dren chases after Elsa and things get freaky and that's when Clive sneaks up and Spears Dren with a a branch only for himself gets stabbed by Dren leading to Elsa taking Dren out with a rock in the aftermath of all of this Elsa continues working for Newstead who has given the green light to continue her research into proteins that were found and Dren's body with Elsa now pregnant so that was a pretty straightforward movie wasn't it? a married couple of scientists go ahead and play God in doing so creating a child that grows up, gets impregnated by the male part of the couple before impregnating the female part of me couple after turning into a male. Right. Right? So at first when I watched this movie I was pretty sure that it was all very straightforward Dren had to have been the one to impregnate Elsa that's why she's pregnant at the end of the movie and why her boss is bending over backwards for her they want whatever genetic goodness is inside the chimera human hybrid whose father is or was the daughter of Elsa technically speaking or something like that but remember that earlier in the film Clive and Elsa get freaky and although I didn't say it the characters explicitly mentioned that they are not using protection before they get down to it this along with the fact that the movie occurs over a period of at least a month or two implies that there's a possibility that Elsa is pregnant with Clive's child but with everything that's messed up in the film: the ethics, the relationships, the experiment itself plus with the dialogue at the end of the movie it is heavily implied that Elsa is carrying Dren's baby for the sake of a big paycheck and a career how exactly a fertilized egg has its DNA overridden with Dren's DNA, I'm not too sure but I assume that it's a result of a mutation caused by the junk DNA that's inside Dren as noted earlier in the film by Clive as being something he's never seen before which is speculated to allow Dren the ability to have body parts that she shouldn't have like the stinger though I'm not a biologist so take my soft serve science thoughts with a grain of salt and let me know what you think was Elsa's baby Dren's or Clive's? Would you sign up to sell your chimera baby for some fat stacks of cash? And did you hear about that Chinese scientist who was working on designer babies who just disappeared one day and no one's seen him since?
