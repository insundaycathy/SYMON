Frankly, I myself was confused by the storyline of this film, but after I thought about it again I just remembered that this is an evil film  -Seek which may only be focused on the excess, the positive message that might be taken from this negative film is Don't leave our friends alone at home, especially if our friends are the opposite sex from our parents because this can lead to an unwanted disobedience. a lesson if our legs are sprained maybe in the form of place 6 can be one solution to cure the pain like what was done in this film I say goodbye and I'll see you in the next Bibah stories Hi Ho
