Through Deok-choon\xe2\x80\x99s clairvoyance, it is revealed that Kim left his friend to die in a burning building during his duty, despite having enough time to save him from death. A bottomless fiery pit opened beneath the ground Kim\xe2\x80\x99s standing on, with a lot of souls trying to crawl up. The two prosecutors that accompany the Judge of Murder try to charge Kim with 5 years in the bottomless pit. However, Mirror of Karma, which plays records of Kim\xe2\x80\x99s life at that moment, reveals that Kim\xe2\x80\x99s friend asks him to save the victims first, before saving him. With these facts taken into consideration, the Judge verdicts that Kim is innocent, and the charge is rejected. For the second trial, Kim will be tried for how well he uses the time among the living. Before facing the Goddess of Indolence, Gang-rim asks Kim not to talk back to the Goddess, without exceptions. To start the trial, Deok-choon describes how Kim is diligent in using his time to save both people and animals, and often has to sacrifice himself in order to do so. The Goddess is touched by Kim\xe2\x80\x99s actions. However, when asked for the reason, Kim replied that he was looking for money. The Goddess, disappointed by Kim\xe2\x80\x99s answer, condemns him to fall down the waterfall. In the River of Indolence, Kim will have to run on a platform while being grinded by stone rollers, or get eaten alive by human-flesh-eating fishes. Gang-rim defends Kim desperately by showing that Kim works so hard to help treat his ailing mute Mother and pay for his brother\xe2\x80\x99s law school. Finally, the Goddess changes her verdict and finds Kim not guilty due to his reasons. Kim and the Guardians then arrive in the Blade Forest. Haewonmak explains that Kim can visit His Mother\xe2\x80\x99s dream before being reincarnated, which boosts Kim\xe2\x80\x99s motivation of clearing the trials. To get through the Blade Forest, Kim, as a Paragon, gets easy access to ride a boat on a slide. On the boat, they are attacked by Hell ghouls. After effortful fighting from Gang-rim and Haewonmak, they succeeded in fending off the ghouls. However, time in the Afterlife is speeding up due to Kim\xe2\x80\x99s family member becoming a Vengeful Spirit. With the time constraint, Gang-rim portaled to the World of Living to find out that the Vengeful Spirit is actually Soo-hong, Kim\xe2\x80\x99s brother. Rumors have spread that Soo-hong has deserted his military post for 3 days. To Gang-rim\xe2\x80\x99s surprise, Soo-hong was killed by his Junior in a gun misfire. Soo-hong didn\xe2\x80\x99t resent his Junior for this. However, Soo-hong\xe2\x80\x99s senior decided to bury him and report him as a deserter to save his promotion. Unbeknownst to them, that Soo-hong was actually still alive and was buried for a whole day before actually dying. Due to this treachery, Soo-hong\xe2\x80\x99s soul became a Vengeful Spirit that seeks to destroy his Senior\xe2\x80\x99s and Junior\xe2\x80\x99s life. Seeing the hidden kindness in Soo-hong, Gang-rim determines to help him reincarnate too. Having cleared the Blade Forest, Kim and the two Guardians arrive in the Hell of Deceit, where Kim will be judged for the lies he has said in his life. The Mirror of Karma shows that Kim writes fake letters to the daughter of his friend, whom he cannot save, and to his Mother for the past 15 years, to give false hope. By the Judge's consent, root trees engulf Kim\xe2\x80\x99s body to restrain him, and to cut out Kim\xe2\x80\x99s tongue. In the panic, Haewonmak calls out to Gang-rim, and Gang-rim starts his final defense on Kim by linking his mind with Deok-choon. Gang-rim reveals that, upon reading Kim\xe2\x80\x99s fake letters, both the kid and Kim\xe2\x80\x99s Mother are having a fulfilling life. Touched by the result, the Judge clears Kim of his charges and allows him to pass the trial. Before going to the next trial, Gang-rim lied to Kim to motivate him in clearing the trials. He told him that both his Mother and his brother are doing well. But this false statement leads to an avalanche in the glaciers of Injustice Hell. If Kim was found guilty in this trial, he would be locked away for years in an ice cage along the Hell of Injustice. Fortunately, due to Kim being just, as a Paragon, they can safely pass without any trial, on a cable car. Upon having chit-chat, Kim found that the Vengeful Spirit was in fact his brother, and that the Guardians are looking to eliminate him. Suddenly, the cable car collapses, and Kim rescues the Guardians. Kim and the Guardians pass through the Heavenly Passage that meanders to the Betrayal Hell. since Kim has lived a noble life, he leaves the Betrayal Hell without any hassle. Then, It is revealed that Gang-rim\xe2\x80\x99s attempt in reincarnating Soo-hong causes the Guardians to have accidents. Haewonmak warned Gang-rim that if he continues to do so, the Guardians will be found guilty and sentenced to death. Gang-rim hunts down Soo-hong and tries to talk to him to let go of his grudges. When Gang-rim is not on guard, Soo-hong takes the opportunity to strike him and breaks away. Soo-hong\xe2\x80\x99s, Junior cannot bear the guilt and reveals the location of the body to Kim\xe2\x80\x99s Mother. While he is doing all this, Gang-rim witnesses everything and follows him through. in fact, Junior wants to commit suicide due to his guilt. when Junior hangs himself and is about to die, Soo-hong's hatred vanishes and pleads Gang-rim to save him.

The God of Violence sentenced him to fall into the bottomless vacuum sinkhole and be crushed by the levitating stones. Before the final verdict, Gang-rim requests to do a combined trial for Kim\xe2\x80\x99s actions are tied to the next trial. A combined trial means Kim will receive double punishment and the Guardians will be stripped of their privileges, if Kim is found guilty. Later, through Deok-choon\xe2\x80\x99s vision, it is revealed that Kim tried to kill all of his family members because they were so poor and had no hope of surviving. Out of his regret and guilt, he beat up his brother and decided to live for his family. He ran out from home and sent money to his Mother regularly to support their life until his last breath.
