Oh, Canada is the national anthem of Canada. Stanley jokingly said that his biggest complaint about his cameo as a DJ in the strip club is that he didn't get to spend enough time with the attractive actresses playing the strippers. Deadpool, as originally created, draws influence from the DC Comics character Deathstroke, also known as Slade Wilson by Rob Liefeld. in the original comic books, deadpool garnered his healing factor from an experiment involving a sample of Wolverines blood. the serum wade is injected with can be seen to have drops of blood in it, implying that those drops of blood come from wolverine. the ammo bag that deadpool fills with firearms that is later forgotten in the final battle is a nod to Deadpool's unlimited weapon and ammo satchel in Marvel Comics. in the trailer and in the film, Wade Wilson requests, please don't make super suit green or animated. this is a reference to Ryan Reynolds his previous role as the DC. superhero Green Lantern in 2011, in which, as stated, the green suit was a special effect, rather than an actual costume for Reynolds to put on. when 20th Century Fox refused to pay the writers of the film, Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, for on-site input, Ryan Reynolds paid out of his own pocket for them to be on set to look over the film. restated. we were on set every day. interestingly, Ryan wanted us there. we were on the project for six years. it was really a core creative team of us, Ryan and director Tim Miller. Fox, interestingly, wouldn't pay for us to be on set. Ryan Reynolds paid out of his own money, out of his own pocket. I personally think this is outstanding and shows Ryan's dedication and passion for making this film great. it's no surprise that this is one of my favorite movies of all time. in Deadpool vol 2, an alternate theory is given for Deadpool's immortality. the entity known as death was the mad Titan Thanos, his lover. but at some point she falls in love with Wilson after he continually meets with her in his near-death experiences. noticing that his lover is falling for another man, Thanos curses Deadpool with immortality so that he would stop making advances on his lover. death.
