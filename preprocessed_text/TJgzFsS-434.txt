Welcome back for another 5 minute movie recap. Today, I'm going to give you an overview of the 1994 English-language French action-thriller film called 'L\xc3\xa9on: The Professional'. There will be Spoilers ahead, so please proceed with caution. L\xc3\xa9on is an Italian-American hitman who lives a solitary life in the outskirts of New York City's Little Italy, where he works for a mafia boss known as 'Old Tony.' L\xc3\xa9on encounters a lonely 12-year-old girl named Mathilda Lando one day. Mathilda now lives in an apartment down the hall with her dysfunctional family and no longer attends her problematic girls' school. The DEA officers who have been paying Mathilda's violent father to conceal cocaine in his apartment are furious. DEA officers assault the premises, headed by finely dressed drug addict Norman Stansfield, after discovering he has been stealing the cocaine. Stansfield murders Mathilda's whole family when she is out shopping for groceries during the raid. When Mathilda arrives, she learns what has occurred only in time to proceed down the hall to L\xc3\xa9on's apartment, where he reluctantly provides her with refuge. L\xc3\xa9on is a hitman, Mathilda swiftly finds. She begs him to look after her and teach her his talents so she may revenge her four-year-old brother's murder. L\xc3\xa9on is first disturbed by her presence and contemplates murdering her, but he ultimately teaches Mathilda and demonstrates how to wield various weapons to her satisfaction. She does his errands, cleans his flat, and teaches him to read in exchange. The duo develops a strong relationship over time. Mathilda admires L\xc3\xa9on and develops a crush on him immediately, telling him she loves him frequently, but he refuses to reciprocate. Mathilda prepares a bag with firearms from L\xc3\xa9on's collection and goes out to assassinate Stansfield after L\xc3\xa9on leaves for an alleged mission. She bluffs her way into the DEA building by acting as a delivery girl, only to be ambushed in a restroom by Stansfield; one of his men enters and reveals that L\xc3\xa9on had just killed Malky, one of the corrupt DEA officers, in Chinatown earlier that morning. L\xc3\xa9on rescues Mathilda after finding her plot in a message left for him, killing two more of Stansfield's men in the process. Tony is aggressively probed about L\xc3\xa9on's location by an irate Stansfield. L\xc3\xa9on tells Mathilda about how he became a cleaner that night; when he was 18, L\xc3\xa9on fell in love with a girl from a rich family in Italy. They planned to elope, but when the girl's father found out about their connection, he killed her. In retaliation, L\xc3\xa9on murdered his father and fled to New York, where he met Tony and apprenticed as a cleaner. Later, an NYPD ESU squad dispatched by Stansfield catches Mathilda as she returns home from grocery shopping and attempts to penetrate L\xc3\xa9on's apartment. L\xc3\xa9on catches the ESU squad off guard and saves Mathilda. By breaking a hole in an air shaft, L\xc3\xa9on allows Mathilda to flee quickly; he tells her to meet him at Tony's in an hour, and tells her that he loves her, only minutes before the police blow up the flat. In the ensuing confusion, L\xc3\xa9on slips out of the building, posing as a wounded ESU officer; he escapes unnoticed except by Stansfield, who chases him down and shoots him in the back. L\xc3\xa9on dies after placing an item in Stansfield's hands that he claims is 'from Mathilda.' It's a grenade pin, Stansfield learns. When he unlocks L\xc3\xa9on's vest, he discovers a cluster of live explosives, which detonate instantly, killing Stansfield. Mathilda follows L\xc3\xa9on's instructions and visits Tony. Mathilda tries to persuade Tony to hire her, but Tony bluntly refuses, telling Mathilda that he had been told by L\xc3\xa9on to give her his money if anything happened to him. He sends Mathilda back to school with a $100 stipend from Leon's finances, and the headmistress re-admits her when Mathilda recounts what happened to her. She then proceeds to a nearby field to plant L\xc3\xa9on's houseplant, as she had advised him to 'give it roots.' If you like this movie, click the link in the description below to watch it today.
