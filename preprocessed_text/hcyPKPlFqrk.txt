\xe2\x80\x9cThis dude is bad, and he aint just \xe2\x80\x98fly\xe2\x80\x99, he\xe2\x80\x99s Super Fly.\xe2\x80\x9d Welcome to Cinema Summary Ladies and Gentlemen. Today we hope to bring you up to speed to the 1972 critical classic of the cadillac-cruising dope-slinging lifestyle. Before there was hiphop, there was funk and the soul; so enjoy your viewing, here we go. Youngblood Priest, an African-American drug dealer who specializes in selling cocaine, enjoys a luxurious lifestyle in Harlem, but finds the dope-dealing life is getting too risky and wants to go clean. The movie begins when Priest confronts Fat Freddie, one of his clients, about money that Freddie owes. Priest gives Fatty a choice: steal from the competition, or your wife gets pressed into working the streets. Freddie isn\xe2\x80\x99t too keen on it but accepts Priest\xe2\x80\x99s generous offer; going with a fellow \xe2\x80\x98employee\xe2\x80\x99 to commit the robbery. So with that done, Priest finds his partner, Eddie, and asks him how much cash they currently have. Eddie tells him that they have $300,000, and Priest reveals his plan to buy thirty kilos of high-quality cocaine, which they can sell for $1,000,000 within four months. With one million, they can leave their life of crime, but Eddie protests that crime is the only option left to them by \xe2\x80\x9cThe Man.\xe2\x80\x9d "It\'s the American dream, N****" Priest is determined, however, and that night, approaches Scatter, a retired dealer who started Priest in the business. Scatter\xe2\x80\x99s new gig is running a restaurant, fairly successful one at-that. At first, he refuses to help Priest, but Priest plays on his emotions, claiming that he wants to get out while he is young and before he has to face the same hurdles that Scatter had to deal with. The hot-tempered Eddie threatens Scatter, politely asking that he better tell them where he gets coke if he won\xe2\x80\x99t supply the dope, but Scatter disarms Eddie and holds him at gunpoint. Priest, ever cool under pressure, defuses the situation and convinces Scatter to help them, although Scatter warns that it will be the last time. Soon after, Priest and Eddie are joined by one of their low-level dealers and Freddie, who turns over the money he stole and agrees that \xe2\x80\x9cthe beef\xe2\x80\x9d between the men is settled. That night, Priest enjoys a romantic bath with his girl friend Georgia, although she disapproves of his drug usage. When Priest reacts hostilely, Georgia explains that she loves him and wants to help him cope with the difficulties of street life (like they say \xe2\x80\x9cBehind every great man, is a great woman\xe2\x80\x9d). The next day, Freddie is picked up for fighting,and gets beaten by the police, revealing the time and place that Priest and Eddie will pick up the first kilo of cocaine from Scatter. Not wanting to get booked, Freddie makes a break for it and dies after getting run over by a car. Meanwhile, Priest and Georgia are strolling in a park, it is here where Priest confesses that he has got a way out of dealing. Georgia pleads with Priest to quit immediately, money isn't the problem, but Priest is adamant: he must get the money, because with his criminal record, he\xe2\x80\x99d be lucky to get a job. That night, after picking up the kilo from Scatter, Priest and Eddie are apprehended by several policemen. The lieutenant in charge, reveals that he is Scatter\xe2\x80\x99s supplier and that the two men can now go directly to him. The lieutenant tells them they can have as much \xe2\x80\x9cweight,\xe2\x80\x9d or kilos of cocaine, as they want, and will be given both credit and protection. After the police leave, Eddie is absolutely delighted by this killer deal, claiming that they are set for life. But Priest has got conviction: after 30 kilos, he\xe2\x80\x99s done, and out of there. Voiceover: [Breathes in, sits back] \xe2\x80\x9cThat much\xe2\x80\x9d. Soon after, the operation is in full swing with both \xe2\x80\x98families\xe2\x80\x99 of Priest and Eddie\xe2\x80\x99s dealing, with many buying their premium coke. Priest\xe2\x80\x99s white mistress, Cynthia, also sells to her friends, but she\xe2\x80\x99s very put-off by Priest once she learns that Priest does not return her love and is planning on quitting the business. By his own admission, as a kid he wanted all the to be successful and rich, with lover like her, but now wants a simpler life and will be ending their relationship. Their argument is interrupted by the sudden arrival of Scatter, who is being pursued by his supplier. Scatter reveals that Deputy Commissioner Reardon is the guy running the operation, and is trying to kill him for quitting. Scatter gives Priest a packet of information on Reardon and his family, then arranges to meet him later, when Priest will give him money and Scatter will escape to New York. But Scatter doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make it: when he leaves, he gets captured and killed by the corrupt policemen, who give him a fatal overdose of drugs and leave his body in Priest\xe2\x80\x99s car. Both enraged and scared, Priest conducts a meeting with two white men, then confronts Eddie. Priest demands his half of their profits, and when Eddie protests that they should keep selling, Priest tells him that Scatter was murdered by the police, and that they aren\xe2\x80\x99t safe. Priest leaves with cash in hand but Eddie snitches to lieutenant. But Priest is no \xe2\x80\x98dummy\xe2\x80\x99, he gives the briefcase carrying the money to a disguised Georgia in exchange for one full of rags. Outside, Priest is held by two patrolmen, smiling when Georgia manages to escape for them undetected. Priest is then picked up by the lieutenant and other policemen and taken to the waterfront, where he and Reardon have their showdown. Reardon threatens Priest that he must continue selling drugs as long as he is ordered to. But Priest got his convictions and so begins a police beatdown. Using his knowledge of karate, Priest kicks ass and takes names, then reveals that he knows who Reardon is. Remember those 2 white men who he met earlier? They\xe2\x80\x99re contract killers, he hired to murder Reardon and his entire family should anything happen to him (Priest) .Reardon thinks he\xe2\x80\x99s bluffing, ordered his men to open the briefcase. To their shock, it\xe2\x80\x99s full of rags. Reardon can do nothing but watch as Priest stalks off, giving the policemen one final glare before driving off to join Georgia (Ride off into the sunset, Mr. Priest. Good luck.)
