Welcome back to Movie Shortens. Follow us today to a movie titled: 6 Souls - Shelter. Be aware, there are spoilers! Cara, a psychiatrist, believes that multiple personality disorder is a psychological fad. After work, Cara calls her daughter, Sam, who is being looked after by her uncle Stephen back home. When Cara is on the way to the airport, she receives a phone call from her father, who also is a psychiatrist, Dr Harding. He tells her that he\xe2\x80\x99ll pick her up at the airport to meet with a patient, who suspected to have multiple personality disorder, At the hospital, Cara complains that her dad only gives her some medical oddities, and perhaps including this time. Harding argues that this case has a whole new kind of act. Just then, Cara sits with a patient on a wheelchair named David. He tells Cara that his legs are disabled due to a car accident when he was a young. Cara does some standard visual tests including ones with multiple small circles in a pattern where the numbers 16 and 73 are clearly visible to normally sighted people. After some basic tests, Cara comes out to tell her dad that David is completely normal. Harding tells Cara to wait for a moment and makes a phone call to the room. When David picks up the phone, Dr Harding asks David to talk with \xe2\x80\x9cAdam\xe2\x80\x9d. David first says that there is no Adam with him. Suddenly, a loud noise is heard in the room. Cara is shocked but she returns to the room under her father\xe2\x80\x99s request. Here, Cara meets with Adam, who transformed from David mysteriously. She proceeds to do the same tests, but Adam behaves quite rudely and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t answer it correctly. He confronts Cara about her husband's tragic death, attempting to hurt her feelings. When Cara shows a card of green circles varying slightly with nothing visible, Adam says it is a number 7. Cara nods and places red film over the card, making a 7 clear. She then asks him if he is color blind and he admits to red deficiency since birth. Adam even stands up - he can walk despite being immobilized by a wheelchair moments earlier as "David". Later, Cara tells Harding that Adam must be the 'host' and David is the 'alter'. The whole case is just Adam\xe2\x80\x99s imagination. She complains to her dad that it was much easier for her to meet with Adam first. The two pick up Sam home from Stephen. Harding hands Cara a box of Adam\xe2\x80\x99s files so she can take a deeper look. Cara becomes attached to this case soon after that as her father insists there is something very strange about Adam. Cara meets with Dr Charles. He first met with David and later transferred the case to Harding when David became Adam back and forth. At this point, Charles\xe2\x80\x99s neck has some blisters. Cara sees that the two x rays taken strangely are different although \xe2\x80\x9cDavid\xe2\x80\x9d and Adam share the same body. However, Cara still believes Adam just makes up everything about David and she\xe2\x80\x99ll prove it. Later, she talks to Charles about the health files of Adam. Strangely, he becomes very sick and the skin is badly rotten. He even vomits black dust out of his mouth. There is a mysterious shadow passing his house at the time. The next morning, Cara follows David\xe2\x80\x99s information and finds the way to his house. She meets with his mother and learns that David was a real person who became a paraplegic after an accident. His mother reveals that David was murdered long ago in the woods, being abused and severely tortured by Satan-worshipping mountain witches. Cara reveals to the woman about Adam, who self-proclaimed him as David. David\xe2\x80\x99s mother is a highly religious person. She believes Adam is possessed and she\xe2\x80\x99ll help Cara cure him. Back home, Cara concludes to her father that Adam just creates a delusion and begins carrying around a mental picture of David since he was young. The next morning, Cara introduces Adam to David\xe2\x80\x99s mother. At this point, he is the real Adam and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know David\xe2\x80\x99s mother. When the phone rings, Adam transforms to David after a very painful convulsion. \xe2\x80\x9cDavid\xe2\x80\x9d talks to his mother in tears, saying that he misses her so much. As the mother is skeptical, David gives her all the details and secrets that only two of them could know. David\xe2\x80\x99s mother becomes scared, saying he is evil and leaves in extreme sadness. Several days later, Cara decides to bring David to the mountain where he was murdered. David recalls the horrible nights and suddenly becomes frightened, saying that the \xe2\x80\x9cevil\xe2\x80\x9d is coming. Cara decides to call for help. Just as she turns around, David transforms again. However, this time it is not Adam. He reveals himself to be Wesley, another personality. Cara again finds that Wesley, a metal band singer, is dead long ago due to suicide. She meets with Wes in the room. He asks her if she believes in science or God. Cara answers that she considers herself a doctor of science, but a woman of God. When Cara shows him an article about his suicide. Wes remembers the night he was in a car. However, he becomes scared and shakes. He cracks his head backward and returns to David again. David tells Cara that evil has been around. Cara is convinced that Adam again created another alternative for his mental problem. She finds the way to Adam\xe2\x80\x99s house. There, she finds a decomposing body. Cara immediately calls the police and reports Adam as a murderer. She goes to pick up Sam at the soccer field, only to find her with Adam. Cara becomes mad, threatening Adam not to approach her family. However, \xe2\x80\x9cAdam\xe2\x80\x9d reveals to be Dr Charles, the 4th personality to be seen. At home, Cara asks Sam about the convo between her and the man. He asks Sam about her faith in God. Sam tells him that since God couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do anything to save her father, she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe anymore. Sam says her grandpa also has no trust in God. Cara finds some rash on Sam\xe2\x80\x99s back, thinking it as allergy. Later, Cara talks about the incident at Sam\xe2\x80\x99s school with her dad. When Cara tells about Adam lied himself to be Charles, Harding reveals that Dr Charles is dead without any reason. Cara is shocked because he seemed very well several days ago. At this point, Harding suffers from bad coughing, just like Charles before. Cara watches over the tapes of Adam again. She notices a huge shadow absorbing Adam while he is sleeping. The next day, Adam is arrested about the body in his house. The detective asks about a strange symbol in the back of the body. However, Adam denies all the charges. Cara realizes she has seen it at David\xe2\x80\x99s house and in the mountain before. She meets with David\xe2\x80\x99s mother again about the symbol, who eventually shows her the way to meet with a witch blind doctor named Granny in the witch mountain. However, Granny doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to talk to her and send her away. Cara sneaks back and sees Granny cutting open an old man, sucking out his soul, and blowing it into a container with a strange symbol on it. Granny then takes out a cancerous lump from his body and sews him up before blowing the soul back into him. The old man wakes up seemingly fine as if he was never ill. The witch doctor turns and asks Cara if she still only believes in science. Granny says that the symbol is the writing of the mountain and is the shelter. Later at night, Stephen lets her know that the shadow in the tape is actually a sound wave of a freaking voice. He then tells Cara to see a man for the exact answers. Cara pays a visit to a man who tells a childhood story, showing Cara a mute home movie recorded by his father. A long time ago a priest named Christian Moore came to his city to preach about God, although he himself did not believe. The priest said witchcraft and pagan rituals were unnecessary and people could be healed by faith. The flu broke out in town, but people believed the priest. When they discovered that the priest was an unbeliever who had vaccinated his two daughters and left the townspeople to die, they killed his daughters. Granny sucked his soul and blew into the air, then filled his mouth with dust so that it couldn't come back. She cursed his body to be a shelter to the faithless. The police tell Cara that they released 'Adam' to her father and that the body in his house was the real Adam. Cara looks at the screen and sees 'Adam' in the midst of the influenza epidemic. He is the faithless priest Christian Moore. Meanwhile, \xe2\x80\x9cAdam\xe2\x80\x9d, who is now Christian is returned to Dr Harding. Cara soon realizes his plan and calls her dad but it is too late. Christian has killed Harding and hosts in his body. Helpless, Cara calls Stephen and tells about her discoveries. He tells her that Sam is ill, just like Charles and their father, and that a strange symbol is burned on her back. Cara asks him to take Sam to Granny. However, the uncle and niece are then confronted by Christian, who insists on being Harding. Stephen is knocked out and injured in the stomach. Cara tells Sam to put the call on speaker and demands to speak to Christian. At this point, Christian transforms back into David and collapses as he needs a wheelchair. Stephen and Sam eventually escape. The three reunite and rush to see Granny. Cara holds Sam and tells Stephen to hang in there with the wound. However, Granny says she cannot help because Sam herseldoesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe in God. Sam will be sheltered with the other faithless souls. As Christian enters the house, Cara holds Sam back to Stephen, who is already dead. The mother and daughter run away from Christian deep to the woods. Sam vomits dust from her mouth, signaling the transformation. Christian arrives and knocks Cara to blackout, eventually hiding in Sam\xe2\x80\x99s body. Cara wakes up, seeing Sam now is in Christian\xe2\x80\x99s body. She holds her daughter in hand for a moment. Suddenly, she strangles the man before piercing him through a root from the ground, attempting to release all the souls in Christian\xe2\x80\x99s body. At this point, Sam revives, to Cara\xe2\x80\x99s surprises. However, the girl\xe2\x80\x99s eyes reveal to be Christian\xe2\x80\x99s.
