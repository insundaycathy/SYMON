Welcome to Cinema Summary, ladies and gentlemen, and CITIES OF LAST THINGS is a dark movie that explores one man's life, the mystery of why he does things, and how he's slowly dying on the inside over the years and this is the City of Last Things the film opens up on a building as doowop music plays before a man jumps off the roof ending his life and establishing the tone of the film quickly and efficiently: it's in the dystopian future of Taiwan where drones are commonplace and used to monitor the people and the people themselves have microchips in their wrists, where we find ourselves following our protagonist the elderly retired cop Zhang Dong-LIng, a cynical and jaded man who is out of place with the world which isn't helped by the fact that the film is shot on 35 millimeter which adds more grit to an already gritty world and the first thing he does after working out is heading to a dance competition and punching out a man touching his wife after getting kicked out he catches a self-driving bus where he studies the Minister of Social Resources Zhi-Shi Wei before he's told to meet up with a contact at the North Municipal Hospital body takes a detour stopping at a brothel to get a gun for a contact there and learns about an expensive drug that supposedly makes the working girls 'beautiful' more on that later as he leaves the North Municipal Hospital he runs into a corrupt undercover cop who's trying to sell the services of underage girls which in the future is 24, believe it or not and as he's showing Dong Ling the girls he spots a foreign girl and takes particular interest in her and wants to meet with her. When he meets her he scans her wrist chip with a POS, a super futuristic smartphone of sorts and the wrist chips themselves function as a form of ID and camera and he's disappointed to learn that she isn't the person he recognises even though the resemblance is uncanny and one thing leads to another and he has a "session" with her and while they're engaging in their session he says a name "Ara" A name which she responds to but once the session is over she charges him for a roleplay experience which clearly confirms that she wasn't the girl he was thinking of and she just thought that he got really into the role-playing and called her that name then he gets on a bus remembering his youth in the reflection of a window as an announcement for a new drug called Rejuvenator resounds in the background. He goes to the North Municipal Hospital where he gets briefed on the target he's going to kill as well as given a disguise and some other things like a severed hand to break into the targets room. The target in question is a Minister of Social Resources Zhi Shi and the way that dong Ling talks to him implies familiarity and bad blood it sounds like "Vice-Captain Zhi Shi" isn\'t the upstanding man that he presents himself as \xe2\x80\x93 as we will soon find out \xe2\x80\x93 after messing with the minister's wrist chip, Dong Ling kills him and escapes getting rid of any evidence in a bin he goes to meet his daughter and they have a chat that reveals a lot of things for one his daughter is dating a foreigner named Tim and they intend to leave the city and Dong Ling has had a strained marriage with his wife Ya Fun for something that happened 30 years ago something that he hasn't forgiven her for and after talking with his daughter Dong Ling goes to visit his wife's apartment where the man he punched from earlier is walking out of who Dong Ling promptly beats up after the man demands that Dong Ling divorce his wife speaking of his wife she's trying to take a new fangled and pricey beauty enhancing drug called "Rejuvenator" \xe2\x80\x93 that drug that I was talking about earlier which has anti-aging properties implied to also have reverse aging properties he confronts her about the drug use and they get into a fight about her infidelity and he ends up killing her this sets off her wrist chip and the man he beat up is found by a security guard and Dong Ling is reported to the police who send an aerial drone after the man. Dong Ling with nothing left to lose or gain shoots at the drunk before leaping onto it sending them both to their death and that's how he dies just like that man from the beginning of the film we then go back 30 years into the past where we see a girl that kind of looks like that prostitute from earlier who is caught shoplifting in his arrested by a young Dong Ling a hot-blooded cop who works a little too hard and too much something that Vice Captain Zhi Shi, the man who Dong Ling kills in the future, notices about him after going on duty he stops by his apartment to visit his wife just to quickly drop by and stumbles onto his wife with another man vice captain Zhi Shi which explains why Dong Ling and Ya Fun  have such a strained relationship in the future and why Dong Ling kills Zhi Shi in the future that and one other thing and Dong Ling almost kills him but is disarmed and is taken down before being forced at gunpoint to leave the apartment and after doing some dark contemplation he goes back to this police station and opens up Zhi Shi's locker to find it filled with bundles of cash and in anger he throws it around getting the attention of the other officers and his boss who demands to see Zhi Shi. After trying and failing to go back home and get answers from his wife as well as spending time with his infant daughter Dong Ling chills outside a convenience store where he spots a familiar foreign girl who is back to shoplifting again Dong Ling stops her and buys the things she steals, leaving her alone only to be confronted by a black van and a suspicious man who he runs away from he doesn't make it far though and is abducted by the men in the van one of which is Zhi Shi and is taken to a stairwell where he's beaten and humiliated by Zhi Shi for screwing up everything and not taking any bribes and Zhi Shi almost executes him before that girl from earlier interrupts so Zhi Shi and his men leave him alone as the girl takes Dong Ling a long bus ride to have a smoke before taking him to a house party where they have a joint with their little adventure ending in them going to her friend's place where they make love and where she introduces herself as Ara and that's how Dong Ling and Ara met and that's why he saw the resemblance between the prostitute and Ara but their afterglow is gonna have to wait as the home owners come back and Ara sneaks Dong Ling out only for the homeowners, presumably Ara's friends finding her and asking her why she's stole a bunch of money something that we never see in the film and after a few tense words, Dong Li and Ara drive away on a motorcycle and chill before going their separate ways never to see each other again with Dong Ling going back to the station where he's arrested and framed by Zhi Shi and the other cops for taking bribe money from gangsters as he sits contemplating about his life Dong Ling remembers a woman and we go back once more into the past where we follow Big Sis Wong a big-name criminal who's probably connected with the Triads and the Tongs, a fearsome lady who was probably paranoid as she grabbed me hostage while eating dinner after spotting some suspicious men who happened to be plainclothes police officers out to arrest her so she runs away ducking and turning down alleyways hiding in the darkness of the night in the city while at the same time a young man tries to steal a motorbike and these two unlikely figures end up literally running into each other and running away from the police and after being pushed into a wall and hit by a car the boy the woman respectively are arrested Big Sis Wang is taken to an interrogation room where we learn that her life is in danger as she snitched on someone she shouldn't have and will be taken to jail she's brought back outside of the room where she and the young men have a chat and after a curious conversation that turns to the topic of the boy's name \xe2\x80\x93 which is Dong Ling \xe2\x80\x93 the woman goes ballistic: yelling and hitting the boy for trying to steal a bike and going on the wrong path in life because this random lady who he had the misfortune of running into is his real mom who wants him to turn away from crime even though she disappeared from his life years ago and the film ends with them taken into two separate police cars literally separated once more and as they look at each other through the car windows, Big Sis Wang is shot leaving Dong Ling motherless once more and distraught as he can do nothing but watch as she's taken from him one more time Cities of Last Things is a tribute to film noir with its chiaroscuro lighting the themes of sexuality and the cynical protagonist, it looks at the darkness within man and society while framed against an ever-changing city which takes on three different forms while still holding on to that darkness with the city itself inflicting pain and loss on Dong Ling again and again driving him to make decisions he becomes a cop to honor the wishes of his murdered mom and he kills both his wife and Zhi Shi, out of an anger that has been festering for decades due to his wife's infidelity and as the title implies it\'s a "city of last things", again and again taking from Dong Ling until all that he has left is his life which in a way was already taken before he ever gave it up because the film starts in reverse order, he was always fated to lose himself to the city: it's a cynical piece of cinema that is as gritty as the films strips it was shot on and with that being said thank you so much for watching ladies and gentlemen if you enjoyed the video leave a like down below and subscribe to get updated on my latest uploads now if you'll excuse me I need a drink to wash out the better aftertaste of this movie until next time you
