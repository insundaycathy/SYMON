hi everyone here welcome back to yet another episode of watching The Watchmen we're done with Watchmen now and unfortunately we have to deal with the afterbirth of this series is being Doomsday Clock it was originally supposed to be a year long thing you know twelve issues twelve months kind of would have been cool wham bam would have been finished by now I think around this time but no we're about 75% 6% of the way in on issue 7 def how's it going yeah good man what's happening everyone thanks for checking out the show I just can't be on oh yeah literally like I caught well I just read this like half an hour before leaving it a little late and I was just I didn't know where I was in the narrative even when I got my footing I couldn't give you know what I mean like I just repeat it yeah I've totally forgotten about it Tom and then you text me last week saying our doomsday clock speed released today and I think I just replied [ __ ] yeah that was it just ruined my day Tom ruined my day as always you know please subscribe check out the old episodes as well that we've gone through a send us an email watching The Watchmen part at gmail calm we don't really get well we already get any emails we definitely don't get any Doomsday Clock emails I don't really want to do a recap or anything this because I just can't really remember so um let's get into it and as ever we'll start with the covers the the lantern with the blue moth yeah quite like it foreshadowing obviously our our hero dr. Manhattan and the green lanten you know that draw the drawn to each other like a moth to the flame Tom mm-hmm can you see what they've done there yeah because they do kind of get into the magnetic pull about the the green light I don't know I don't know why but basically they have to use the Green Lantern to pull don't mother don't do they they use Bubastis yeah so what is the Green Lantern for then don't really know I know getting it myself um and I only read Oh today no it's it's not it's not clear and we have lots of references to Green Lantern in the star and this stuff again I don't mind them doing this like you know we we spoke at length about issue four of Watchmen how you know it's one of the greatest things ever created in graphic novel form document hands origin and one of the most sophisticated things it does is telling this of temporal narrative across many different dimensions and they kind of a pit here John's is aping in here giving us the alan scott green lantern history um i don't mind this but one of the things that hit me reading these opening panels especially there's just so many cuts to TV and newsreaders and there's just so much background being force-fed in your gut yeah really does get convoluted at one point and we'll talk about it as we get into it because it's not whoa it's just all over the shop really tom the entire the entire comic book is just it as a run it has very little focus every single issue is just jumping about from place to place and it just doesn't really feel like there's a driving narrative behind it to me it just feels like a lot of spontaneous events um yeah it's just yeah like Watchmen itself that was set over like probably the space of about three months I think whereas this is like within 72 hours and it's just cramming in so much information during that time none of the characters themselves really have time to reflect on the events and like Dan and Laurie in the original graphic novel they saw reflected on what was happening in brought a more relatable aspect to it and that you could kind of see it through a human's eyes and be taken in by these grandiose events whereas Doomsday Clock it's just happening so quickly it's so convoluted and there's not really a human side to it that we can kind of view the events through I don't think everyone's either mental or has had this [ __ ] kicked out of them there's not that grounding human side which it was what Watchmen did so well it took the the supernatural and brought it down to a human level whereas this just doesn't have that side to it and it really suffers because of it I think yeah it doesn't the the Manhattan that we meet in the intros is kind of absolutist you know monarch of fate I kind of like the idea of him sort of pushing the lantern out the way and yeah in this reality the guy dies and you know it's kinda it's kind of noisy sort of I don't really understand the whole dynasty the the oriental gentleman I'm covering the lamp is that just a sort of exists in time yeah I think so basically the opening discusses Alan Scott who was the first Green Lantern and he was the Golden Age one before they updated it without Jordan in the earth to graphic novel run from the new 52 which is an incredible story by the way Alan Scott's actually gay in that so a couple of years back there was a huge thing for DC kind of making one of their classic characters gay and it is a great road light it starts off pretty mad but it gets really good as it goes on so definitely definitely check that out if you what the hell are you doing still reading Doomsday Clock read a better comic but anyway back to this so this is continuing the storyline of Johnny Thunder finding his ring yeah so I mean it was released about seven months ago the last issue a Korra member of that well but anyway dr. Manhattan discusses the history of the ring and how we changed the timeline by killing Alan Scott by moving the ring from the clutches of his hand on the train crash that started his origin story now credit works too I do think Jon's does a brilliant job of capturing dr. Manhattan's voice and in this opening page when I was reading their house thinking hard it's great to see him return and this introduction on just this one page alone was probably the most interested that have been in the series since about issue one and everyone's theory that the doctor you know he left the Watchmen universe and he traveled to the DC one that's confirmed on this page mm-hmm and I just wish they could have kept up the quality of this page yeah there's the dog they don't - you know you're right it's 1985 I leave my world for this one is awesome and it just sums up that journey so powerfully I just realizes well you can see in the [ __ ] the Fanueil dusk or wherever that guy's called who comes up later like yeah though the worst like the absolute most horrible take on the whole black Freya's story in a story thing I just yet really don't have never and I was I didn't really know what was going on in the plot I I was kind of thinking how did you get out the asylum didn't the moth break him out but I was like oh no that wasn't in this world it was in the other world and they was Saturn girl the broken out of Arkham Asylum and you know he was put into this prison but there wasn't really any tension him breaking out so that kind of defeats that purpose and we get all these weird characters kind of melded together and I don't know none of them are that interesting no as as we move through the old man in particular the Hellfire at the back as well as a little bit on the nose and Archie arrives and then we get as eventually before lots of TV screens I mean all of the third page is exposition exposition kind of a car number was the last issue of the one before which are quite liked where they showed the map of all the metahumans and you was seeing them in action and there's some reference to Doom Patrol as well which is pretty cool which is kind of DC's oddball I think they're doing something soon on the DC Universe app with that I think Brendan Fraser's in it actually as well yes but but yeah I mean what your thoughts on this backdrop here the context it's just it's just nonsensical um and it it's all over the shop and it really took me out the booth could do who are just being so sporadic and I think that they could have summed up this entire page with just a line of text that was owed by one of the characters which just needed to be something along the lines of metahumans are on the rise and it's slowly destroying the world but it's just poorly handled and it really is jarring and again it's that jumping between characters thing that Watchmen talk completely avoided it was very rare that watchman's switch perspective if each issue picked its main character that was going to be the center of that issue and followed them that entire issue from their perspective so we get great things like Rorschach and being interrogated but interviewed by Malcolm get dr. Manhattan's perspective we get as him indices as he travels the world whereas this is just so it's so inconvenient and just it's all over the place Tom I mean we get our first viewing of Superman since issue one but it's through a screen and once again it just hammers home how detached a lot of the characters are from the actual run itself and I watch this great thing last night about how comedies more and more are sort of relying on cameos and but they're not good cameos they're just like a celebrity showed up and that is like the punchline and now this kind of feels a bit like that where it's they're just showing up for the sake of showing up but it's not it's got no substance to it it's got no way and there's no real impact to it because of it no you're completely right yeah I've like LeBron James I think is in some sick some rom-com or some [ __ ] I watched and that felt very much just I guess a modern-day Superman to a certain extent but yeah they're on Archie we're seeing Superman here in Libya called the last true super in the world that sort of idea there's just there's no momentum to this plot there's nothing interesting there's no I think pushing it forward it's not gathering pace in the slightest and we learned that Bubastis is this weird compass thing for dr. Manhattan's somehow yeah what the [ __ ] is this this is a plot device that is happening things do they not mention that it's because own from the remnants but even still it's like just this glowing cat that leads you to this god I don't know yeah it doesn't it's not the best is it let's be honest guys even doomsday defenders yeah I don't really know if he can defend that to be honest it's just weird throughout and it's a really weird way to track dr. Manhattan I you could have easily mentioned the tachyons or something or his energy signature just something but just using Bubastis it's a bit I mean I did that Bubastis is fine in the comic and they they could have just brought them along as like a pet is just a character like as human dies likes to bring Bubastis along with him but the fact that they give him like this tracking device that he can follow dr. Manhattan it's just saying yeah yeah I mean even if they just got like I don't know some DC character that could join the team and he can track man hang on though X you know what would have been interesting if they had a cloned Rorschach cuz he was killed by dr. Manhattan wasn't he so he could have had parts of his energy signature and then we could have find found out that Reggie was a clone or something but the yeah it's just I don't hold on you could you could sit and think of a million better things yes yeah I think yeah I I agree and Ozzie sort of totes off the ridiculousness the you know he's incredulity you were led to Arkham Asylum by Batman and locked up later free bodies for new claims be here from the future and then brought here claiming to be a hero from the past and not in in the hands of a skilled storyteller that could be quite exciting elements to a plot but here it's leaden it's uninteresting we get the transitions as we always do from our Z smile into the watch what a what smile gate by the way I know you're more on MCU than me I saw this trending is it some controversy her II don't know and that's some Captain Marvel thing I don't know what it is but I've seen I said just because are you right yeah yeah I dunno it is I think I do anyway but I heard him mention it on a podcast the other day base mark benedi image in it which basically Captain Marvel doesn't smile in the new Captain Marvel trailer yeah I didn't even know it was it to be honest no never I would never what your trailer and be like haven't smiled I hate this movie just to notice it and I've totally forgotten about it there till you mentioned that it was a marvel right think the joke of rocky have gotten the badge comedian is being held hostage here again Joker isn't written that well like he can be such a fun canvas for people to express themselves on like more I'm gonna mention again all the book puns that he does when he paralyzes Barbara Gordon in Moore's voice I just I just love that [ __ ] and I think the artworks cool here from Frank's it's always nice to see Joker's lair but again quite quite slow plotting this whole sequence yeah and this sort of derails the notion that one of the three Joker's as the comedian mmm so basically Tom if you didn't know Batman in Darkseid war managed to get a seat on the Mobius chair which is a chair that allows whoever sits in it to have all of the knowledge in the universe and Batman when he was sitting on it asked what the identity of the Joker was and it replied there are three and DC kind of used the whole joke identity finally revealed pitch to get everyone to buy rebirth issue one and but in that they just said that there were three I was a bit annoyed top I'm not gonna lie because I was in Spain at the time and I heard ah [ __ ] the big Joker revealed his name and I bought the the comic digitally for about a pound Tom and I stupidly downloaded it over him like over 4G in Spain right so it cost about 50 pound which I was not happy about especially the fact that they didn't even reveal his name but now because of that people sort of have speculated that one of the Joker's could be could have been the comedian and but I think you know Tom between me you and me I think a lot of us know that DC just threw it in there with no real idea of what they would do with it and after about three years of rebirth we still haven't had any resolution to it and I think it's gonna be a completely drop plotline so it's been cleared up here that one of them is not the comedian yeah yeah it's a bit bit [ __ ] home it is a big [ __ ] and it gets [ __ ] really you know we have marionette here ploughing comedian I mean I quite like when she says what does she say says something about like that's the you say that's the bad bad that's the easy pain she says if she looks me in the eyes which i think is quite a dark line i quite like that line but you know comedian taking the strain there and then sort of you know he's being held hostage to a certain extent being interrogated and yeah again these two characters haven't grown on me at all somehow Batman standing up and able to fight back even though is pretty much decapitated in the last one yeah which is a sort of Batman thing show up and you will always get back on its feet but how good is it Tom so Batman manages to escape the torture that the Joker and the mime and marionette were inflicted on the comedian um and just as it's getting interesting we'll cut back to Oz human Dyess so Batman just stands up somehow runs off that's it that's it yeah oh great no no and I mean we established then the mind could fire actual bullets because I thought that was like a joke but he's actually firing something yeah have we seen him fight something before I think we have yeah I think in one of the episode and one of the issues you seen him like that it did actually have a gun hmm and but it's just invisible yeah which okay yeah yeah and don't put it down because you'll you'll lose that make sure you keep it on your hand at all times Bubastis is back say you know screeching this little Tom Tom this little cat NAV if you will leading us on again you know we've kind of said what we need to say about the arse well I think the eye is very good you know Gary Frank is very good at drawing faces the lantern is passed over return back to Batman there's more fighting between all of them in this dusk it is what it is really I think a lot of the fighting your watchman was quite lyrical and poetic and interesting if nothing else original ways of combat this is just a sort of a scuffle and we see yet again that a deadly pincer rope that she's throwing through and then Joker just was sort of the lame happy to see me flame fry so you're better than that yeah that's really bad isn't it yeah especially in the middle of the fight it's just kind of like eye rolling ly bad um yeah and I don't like it so they arrived anyway the lads the main the main thing that would be waiting for 4/7 issues which is the return of dr. Manhattan I finally get to the middle which is conveniently also where Joker and the Batman and the comedian are and they put that they used the green lanten to create a pole yeah to bring dr. Manhattan out yeah yeah yeah anyway that is what happens yet yeah do that and then there's a blue dick in it Tom mm-hmm made me chuckle cause they showed the show he's Dick Tom and that's sort of what we've been debating I don't know if you've seen all the controversy recently surrounding Batman's dick I haven't had I'm not talking about Raman there I'm not talking about Robin there I should have led with that Tom but yeah Batman's dick so basically DC I do and like a new darker and grittier you know in quotes and quotes comic line called I don't know what the the line itself score but there's a new Batman book called Batman damned and in Batman number one the showed Batman's dick I know you Google in it right now to see it and but those loads about its own panel yeah loads of outcry from the internet and you know we'll finally get a see Batman's dick who know the Canon of Batman's dick Oh another another pun there your Canon okay anyway DC have retracted it and said that they're removing the dick from all future printings yeah and it's quite funny because he has our docs dick showing off he's a little Smurf to the world oh yeah I'm just on it now I'm on a Vox article titled Batman's penis is in the comic book for the first time ever but not for long yeah it's now a collector's item okay so you can sort of see it it's yeah hooded I suppose yeah and then we get you know what woman Watchmen sort of famous for abstract paneling invention experimentation with that I don't mind sort of seeing you know the Blitzkrieg to dr. Manhattan and then the panels underneath I think they could have done something a bit more interesting and I think someone like Frank quietly for example would have went a bit more to town on this but yeah man hands back this is this is the money shot yeah this is a back but it's completely ruined for me personally by the Joker screaming out whoever you are put on some clothes for God's sake or at least for mine haha no I mean it's terrible table it's ruined really a screenshot that when I saw it and sent you it cuz it just wasn't good Tom it really derailed that moment you know dr. Manhattan he's meant to be this awesome figure like remember in the movie when they were all sitting in the canteen and then he just appears in the middle of it floating above them it's like looking up at a god and here it's not it's not at all Tom it's [ __ ] they really [ __ ] this up like like this could have made them so much money just couldn't be like an iconic story they forget the fact about us Watchmen fanboys getting pissed off that they're bringing it back you know doesn't matter but yeah he arrives on this chessboard with a sort of satanic Crowley circle around him and you know we we get a call back to I guess the panel call back is to when Manhattan arrives when it's Laurie and Dan and then takes it makes eggs are straight off and then goes to Mars and it reminded me a little bit as well we'll get into this a bit later when sort of Ozzy's motives are revealed properly in the betrayal and the realization of Laurie and and Reggie in this so yeah we get the harking back and Anne Hatton still looks like he's still one of the most badass characters in history but in graphic novel so it still so cool to have him there hovering on this this disk above this bubbling forest and we get we finally get the truth deaf about why he spared them their pregnancy yeah he saw what the child could have been mmm or something hmm and he tells them that they're gonna have another baby yeah yeah I mean when I was reading it I just thought it was handled really badly yeah um it's sort of just delivered like an offshoot like dr. manhattan's just saw performing magic tricks like he's doing some fortune-telling but it doesn't really have the weight to it that it should it just comes off like it you'll be rich I've read your fortune you're having a baby thank you and then the audience just sort of clap it doesn't really feel like that impactful to me at least anyway no I'm sure someone at IGN thinks it's the best comic ever written yeah and I mean just the fact that it's like what are you talking about what did my child do which child what do you mean which child oh yes sometimes I forget what's been and what will be it's like do you know like isn't that your whole character that you don't like I don't know everything within your life yeah you can view it all at once yeah like yeah you don't forget stuff dr. Manhattan no no i-i've made it he may deliver things at the wrong time but he doesn't say that you forget stuff no and he doesn't error like a human would error there he doesn't have any slips of the tongue like that's just 9 no repertoires very black-and-white yeah he's very methodical and he's assuring and he ret he never really changes his mind he's very finite and affirmative it's just very he's never like Madonna he's not like us on this podcast you know I mean he he knows that everything is a fact everything's said as a fact it's never an opinion and it's never like oh yeah what was yeah well as a kid again you both work or the call and like what you mean I've only got one oh yeah it's forgot yeah sorry you got one it's down the road you get the two you know what I mean I'm just just looking at the future now kids you're gonna have a bunch of kids [ __ ] it up ya know you learn as well that Adrian doesn't have cancer this reveals boring nothing hinged on this is enough any impact for me at all and I struggle to believe that that's what gave Reggie motive as well that's what finds it quite hollow for me he's your action I don't find believable at all yeah yeah but Tom did you like how they're standing on a chessboard yeah mental game of chess I can only make certain predetermined path so I suppose and I guess just some sort of movement that Manhattan just walks in certain directions I don't really know but yeah this gets revealed I can't really remember why I was he needed to lie to get were shocked involved it was too long ago but yeah parent is a big deal breaker for old face yeah I don't know why he would need a lie either be honest you just be like look we need to go save the world yeah there's people outside my door now they if they're allowed to come in they're gonna destroy the universe we need to go I know you don't like me Rorschach I know you think I'm a bit of a bad guy but come on gotta work together have you seen x-men to Tom god-like cinema when I was very young yeah Magneto and Professor X they have to work together you know it's about fighting the greater bad hmm so yeah the cancer thing was pointless yep and it's not really been touched upon that much to the where it feels like a big plot point it was just sort of like on an x-ray in the background an occasion you say I ever cancer and because cancer was a big plot device in Watchmen as well it just sort of fades into that whole broth and I don't think it has much impact beyond that you know it's great to see Reggie's dad here obviously the home and the [ __ ] Rorschach test scenes in the prison are so good like he's just making me look back and I love how we see him from the back which I think's the final scene of the abyss gazes also as he's looking into the into the ink lot which is so so good and again Ozzy sharing about his parents dying they died despising one another alone I really know how he knows that but yeah you wouldn't know that there's no no way yeah they I don't even know why you would take interest in Malcolm to be honest and without like knowing that he's a main character that there's no absolutely no reason why would you would like surely would take as much interest in like a prison guard or something yeah it doesn't really make any sense but I'll let it pass Tom it's comics yeah I go yeah but what I do like is that Rorschach it's sort of the route you know comes to the realization that he's a bit of an idiot I mean you saw of Rorschach in this one he's left at his most vulnerable and he seems a bit mental and what I want to see is his Redemption is arc of redemption I'm quite interested in seeing that down the line I think Rorschach - probably is the most interesting character in this book so I'll say we'll say something nice Tom I don't know how long we've been going on it's been nearly half an hour I'll say my first nice thing I'm still interested in Rorschach okay so there you have a listeners but yeah you starting really a convoy just interested in but I know it's positive yeah yeah I mean I just I just wish we could I just wish I had the hardback I'll just finish the whole thing tonight yeah break it down and it's just like what's being being drip fed this but yeah I mean Reggie's yeah he's fine um so we see the sort of world you know slowly bubbling over here um what is this red panel where it says I saw a vision of the most hopeful among them heading towards me now hopeless why is that showing that Superman isn't it is that Superman always that look he's cape or something um it looks like his eyebrow is I in his nostril to me right okay okay can you say that I can't actually no no I can't see that top lines his eyebrow and below that his eye closed eyes closed oh yeah yeah I see it no yeah and I think it looks a little bit similar to when marionette like blinds people was like that I remember that sequence in the alleyway where she comes at a guy with the string then it goes all red and black but yeah yeah actually yeah I can see it now that's interesting okay and then you know I guess these are sort of similar to the dog Keene Act stuff in Watchmen as well these sort of crowd scenes and then we get some the Fanny awesome the Fanueil does what is this about I don't know I don't know dr. Manhattan transports them to the theater where we see a black and white movie playing which is the the Nathaniel dusk thing and I just hope this isn't the big end of that because it's just a terrible inclusion and I honestly I don't really know what I like why they went there no it's just don't get at all no no I don't I think it's not clear over and you know the characters don't really understand why he brought them there over maybe it'll make sense maybe yeah maybe down the line they'll be like some big reveal oh my god they've said this since issue one but I would say Karla Coleman's head hits the floor that's what he talks about you see that yeah well that means yet no no and yeah I just I just don't like this obscurities I'm like it's like you know rare the the game company are often insulted for this where they set something up really you have to go all the way back to get it and then it's like I don't know like some of that stuff's great fill in the blanks is sometimes really fun it can make enliven a story but in this case not so far you know we get more fights you're you're still wearing the mask of the man who destroyed your father is a nice idea here and Ozzie always has a real like stinging thing to say about to beat the [ __ ] out of him yeah you like that but yeah I mean fights happen here Batman gets shocked in the head Ozzy's getting punched to death Joker's getting punched back and forth back and forth yeah I do quite like this bit and I did think that Ross I could kill the Joker yeah and he gets his big red smile on his face and when I was reading that though it didn't feel impactful because obviously the joke has died about seven million times so I knew this wouldn't hold much way and basically we then find out that the Joker isn't dead and it's Rorschach who's actually dead like his persona like a Star Wars thing whether like Anakin Skywalker was killed by Darth Vader um which it didn't really have the impact with me in all honesty but basically the plans over it all went to [ __ ] white gets angry he hits a woman it just feels like a chaotic mess with no real end at this point I was I was rolling my eyes a bit Tom I was wrong my eyes quite a lot for this bit yeah me too me too I mean yeah my my sockets were sore by the time I was done really you know we move through we get Saturn girl here everyone's descending upon Archie the old man gets kicked in the face by Ozzy Ozzy still has a plan apparently even though he yeah that's the plan just went to [ __ ] why'd you kick them people and hit them toy don't I guess he just sort of in a you know post rage I don't really know his motive that he never really seemed violent in Watchmen even when like he's at carnac and they're Rorschach and night-owl are fighting him doesn't seem violent he's just seems like he's so just blocking because it doesn't want to get hurt he's up her but he never at no point does you know fight throw the first punch in any Watchmen no it's always he's put into it he's backed into a corner and he's just blocking and striking and disabling people he's never on the offensive he's always on the defensive except for when he sets off the bombs so for him to go into Archie and punch a woman in the face and kick an old man just seems out of character yeah yeah I guess it's supposed to make us feel for these characters to an extent but they're so shallow and uninteresting that I don't you know I'm not there we get lots of snapshots on the next page lots of world-building black Adam is entering Jerusalem apparently something's being posted to Lois Lane I guess in a sort of new frontiersman correspondence there the chess imagery persists Manhattan touching down on Mars all these fingers coexisting maybe something from the Fanueil dusk I'm not quite sure what that is now I do like this section I have to say I think this is pretty cool actually the the furthest he can see in the future is Superman running a team then he sees nothing beyond that yeah so we'll get a tease of Superman fighting dr. Manhattan everything goes black and he says he doesn't know if it's the end of his life finally or if it's him just strong the universe spoiler alert Tom it's him dying because no way our DC ending this lucrative cash curl that they've built up for the last day he is yeah but we'll say Tom I don't know how dr. Manhattan just doesn't wipe Superman out to be honest no I don't know how a punch is gonna affect dr. Manhattan either he doesn't seem like he's that tangible yeah I don't understand what punching him would do no no cos gangs rebuild his intrinsic fields carne so it's like what is he yeah I mean yeah it's yeah it's fine it's a punch as well just uh punch it it's the best way to solve it solve any problem tell them just by punching it remember in Watchmen when like the Tri assault the the wars by setting up this elaborate plan that would trick people into uniting you know one nation in order to fight each other no all wrong Tom they should've just for their problems by punching them we get the photo which I guess brings us back full circle to the fourth issue the incredible photo which we went deep on in the issue in danger to be a classic more within the frame of the paper itself I think there's a balloon floating off into nothing as you see someone's hand Janey Slater of course I don't know again I don't really know what this photos here why it's just sort of flying around in the dress but remember Watchmen tom is he why is he landing where he landed before and then I guess the photo hasn't moved since yeah maybe because it did drop it didn't he so yeah that's what it's employing that's very good then yeah kept that consistent come I mean there might not have kept the characters consistent there might not have gave a compelling story but at least they've got the position of that photograph right it's just the fact again that they have the cause asleep I'll sleep good tonight Tom knowing that continue who the hell is our I'm just cooling a R Buckminster Fuller okay so he was an American architect and an inventor okay so he was some sort of you know whiz kid back in the day not as we heard him myself seeing is believing is a blind spot in man's vision this is the closing quote here and I mean I guess that's pointing to the imperceptible 'ti of certain things right some subatomic things as opposed to a certain extent and perhaps we shouldn't trust what our eyes capture yeah maybe I don't know Tom what's going on it was a lot of crap that was that was a terrible issue of comics a waste of everyone's time cluding our listeners but yeah there we go issue seven and even the back stuff which I know you don't really read death and a quick glance through I quite you you can see the Bubastis Tory though it's quite a nice effect yeah I did like that actually had to read this one and it talks about the backstory of new Bubastis and so the death of the original and then the cloning and yeah it's nice the the figures is the best thing yeah and it's you can tell that bite clearly hung up on the death of this cat and to me it you know it does some nice painting of the backstory like when awesome and I said goodbye old friend when he killed Bubastis I thought he was talking about dr. Manhattan but clearly he was talking about the cat and basically it sets up Bubastis in Manhattan and it talks about the cat rebuilding itself and then appearing near the fence and stuff yeah not sure about where doesn't yeah yeah again just I mean walking back hulking back but that was Doomsday Clock issue seven we still got [ __ ] five left yet five issues left yeah he's as Christ got an eight point eight and IG end on IGN is just baffling isn't it just this show they really over eight everything I mean they just they're clearly in the pocket you know but are definitely but then most of these comic book websites seem to love this so I just yeah enjoy it look I'm not gonna hate but I just are everything is very good yeah since IGN played your eyes a lot of reviews I'm gonna plagiarize one of them come Doomsday Clock seven gives the series an adrenaline boost as dr. Manhattan finally emerges from hiding and I don't know what the hell these people are reading Tom because that was no adrenaline boost for me he showed up talk to them and then [ __ ] off yeah I don't know what their big shot in the arm was there yeah it's like apparently he gets punched just oh god I'm pumped now oh wow great writing guy yeah cannot wait for this carpet roundup gave it an eight point six out of ten fortress of solitude give it a 7.5 I mean user rating nine point five on comic book roundup getting tens all over the place of I'll read or read big a read em geek dad's little review of it this is the issue I've been waiting for since Doomsday Clock began combining the whip-smart writing with the plot advancement I've been waiting for I what plot advancement happened Tom what has moved forward in the plot they're actually back at square one if anything you're right there then ominous one here from Steve J Ray I'm looking forward to the future if there actually is one well well there's not Tom if it's more [ __ ] like this to be honest with you yeah yeah it was a little crap and we'll be back in two months or so tackle issue nine as ever please people go back check out our other discussions check out what we spoke to mr. J Higgs as well that was a crazy episode we've got some comments as well Tom I just got one from Eric punt Doomsday Clock is so boring and so superficial it is a shame that DC has the arrogance to think that they can make a sequel of the masterpiece Watchmen I will stop reading this Doomsday Clock from now on but please don't stop listening though Eric PS your Watchmen analysis is are masterful thanks a lot is it analysis or analysis is it analyses maybe I don't know Josh will cool he comments quite a lot Tom so it's good that he's still on board with us especially after slugging it off I'm still enjoying the book and I said to Josh if you're listening please please reply I've been waiting for three months I know you've you've left me unread I said what do you like about it but I didn't get reply so it would be good to see what people enjoy about this book because I can't really find anything maybe it's because I'm sat with you Tom and you're a negative Nancy I suppose so Ivy I just it's it's called taste it's like it's like I'm gushing Lee positive about good stuff and it's like I just can't I just I just can't justify this I'm afraid I just it's it's yeah I think it's a load of crap really I think I think it's a failure I think it's a failure yeah it feels I really should have like revitalized the comic book industry no I mean the return of Watchmen the Watchmen and DC Universe is coming together and it just at this point feels like a non-event it reminds me sort of the The Dark Knight Returns 3 mm which how so invested like every two months I was gone the comic shop to see if they had it in and just got delayed so much in Seoul that will happen that by the end of it didn't care and it is like I have went back and read it as a trade-in it is a good book but this doesn't feel like it's even up to that level to be honest so don't know what they're gonna do Tom no but you know we'll be here to recap and decorate and to inform and yeah I mean as always it's boring isn't it literally bringing up the same points every issue I know I don't know how many times I can say this is going nowhere yeah and it's jumping about from seeing the scene with no real perspective and there's nothing to really ground it there's no characters I like in it Tom even Batman I don't know what he is it's just a nonentity in this run there's nothing I like yeah it's it's a seeming disappointment but you know hopefully if you [ __ ] with the show you down for the analyses anyway you know subscribe to all our channels and all that good stuff yeah make sure you subscribe to me guys I care about these days just hit 5000 subscribers Tom I've tell you what I've just hit five thousand two hundred and twenty seven so that number is growing every day it'll be six thousand soon and then I can retire and stop doing this [ __ ] how many subscribers do I need till I can quit Tom laughs well what to stop doing Doomsday Clock let's say five thousand two hundred and fifty I think when it gets to that number we can stop doing it I think it might hit oh wow if I hear right now yeah hopefully hopefully well I'm emailing by the time you're listening to this guy's you just go and look at my subscribers and if we passed that number then it's over I like to thank youse all for taking the time to listen take care good night well everyone watching The Watchmen pod at gmail.com send us a message over there we'll get to that on the next issue are you still reading doomsday [ __ ] as Eric Ferguson always mentions it as but yeah death this has been a treat regardless thank you much [Music]
