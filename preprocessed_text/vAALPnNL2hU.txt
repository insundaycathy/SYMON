If you got lucky with that Tinder date, only to wake up under a desolate bridge tied up in a wheelchair, and your lover told you they cursed you with a sexually transmitted demon that is going to come after you. That it could look like anyone, but it never stops, it just follows you until it kills you. What do you do? In this video on Nerd Explains, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you: How to Kill, the Monster from, It Follows. In the movie, your lover is kind enough to actually show you the entity that is after you, AKA a naked woman shuffling towards you under a bridge at night. They then take you home so you can have a head start avoiding this thing. There is no doubt in your mind that something is coming for you considering what you saw, but also that you might be certifiably crazy. Either way, you need to figure out what to do Right before we jump in though, if you find these types of videos entertaining, consider clicking the like and subscribe buttons as it really helps me to make more. Before your date runs away, you have to convince them that you can fight this thing, but you need to know what you are dealing with and stick together. So, what do they know about this thing? They tell you it slowly walks towards you, never sleeps, never stops, until it gets close enough to turn you into a pretzel or otherwise brutally kill you. It can take the form of anyone. It kills in a chain, and if you have sex with someone you pass it on them an so forth. Nobody can see the entity but the victims. As far as they know, none of the other victims have attempted to stop it, they\xe2\x80\x99ve all just ran or passed it on. Just like this punk bitch did to you. Wait a second.. this thing is basically a discount Pennywise.. Anyways, it seems obvious you should call the cops, I mean, this pretty much seems like a crazy stalker serial killer. But you\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen old ladies shuffle towards you in public, coldly and unceasingly staring into your eyes, what stalker does that, what stalker can change forms, or is it multiple stalkers, this whole thing is fucking crazy. And the other victim is adamant that nobody else can see it but you. If that\xe2\x80\x99s true the police will think you\xe2\x80\x99re crazy and probably detain you, which will get you killed. You need to buy some time to think and make a plan, but first you need to avoid getting killed. You can keep it at a distance by walking. So with the other victim, walk to an open area away from people, you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be indoors and get trapped or bump into the entity accidentally. Watch for any naked elderly women or deceased family members shuffling towards you. Get to your car, fill it up with gas, energy drinks so you don\xe2\x80\x99t get tired and doze off, snacks, pull some ATM money out, and start driving, just anywhere. Now you need to prove to yourself that you aren\xe2\x80\x99t crazy. Call a friend or family member. Tell them to meet you at an isolated location. Tell them it\xe2\x80\x99s serious and you need their help. Don\xe2\x80\x99t make them panic and call the police, that would just complicate the situation. You just need to figure out if you\xe2\x80\x99re crazy or not. Once they arrive, tell them you think someone is after you. Once the entity appears, point it out. Once your friend tells you they don\xe2\x80\x99t see the thing, you\xe2\x80\x99re probably going to realize, holy shit, either I am crazy or this thing really is invisible to non-victims. Grab your drink and throw it at the entity. It bounces off an invisible object from the perspective of your friend. That confirms that this thing is a real physical being, you learn it\xe2\x80\x99s invisible to everyone but the victims, and very importantly, you know you\xe2\x80\x99re not crazy. This isn\xe2\x80\x99t a crazy stalker, this is something unnatural. Get back to your car and get on the road again. What can you do? If you just start having sex with randos, you are effectively killing tons of people, and even if you\xe2\x80\x99re a sociopath, you have no idea when the entity kills its way up the chain back to you, you lose all awareness and give it the complete element of surprise. You have to look over your shoulder for the rest of your life. Every time you go to sleep you could wake up dead. You could probably make traveling work, but again, the sheer mental burden of having to look over your shoulder for the rest of your life will destroy you. Even if you can sustainably travel around avoiding the entity for the rest of your life, you can\xe2\x80\x99t really have sex morally, and you don\xe2\x80\x99t know if this entity can change the rules. Who says it has to walk slowly, who says it can\xe2\x80\x99t wait for you when you get back. You could get on a boat and go to sea. But if you\xe2\x80\x99re wrong about the entity\xe2\x80\x99s ability to swim, it\xe2\x80\x99s speed, or anything else, and you turn around and see the monster climbing onto the boat while you're anchored at sea. You are fucked. You could try to trap it by enlisting some friends to help dig a hole in the ground in a remote field, then knock the monster into the hole and pour concrete on top of it. You don\xe2\x80\x99t know how strong this thing is or what its shapeshifting abilities are, or if it will sense the trap and avoid it. It can turn into a child or a tall man, maybe it could do some T1000 terminator shit to ooze out of the concrete. You\xe2\x80\x99d constantly have to check if the entity got out of it eventually. You still wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be able to live in peace. You could try drawing it out to a remote area and gun it down, but you\xe2\x80\x99ll find out that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t put it down for good, and what do you do with the body? I wouldn't get close to it. Not to mention, this thing has invisibility, and not just traditional invisibility. If two people are observing the entity simultaneously, and one is afflicted while the other is not, this entity's visibility is different for both observers. The entity can also find you anywhere, anytime, no matter what. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have NSA level access, it just knows. How. Both of these things are theoretically impossible. The resounding consensus in your mind is that you have no idea what you\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with. I think we can admit that when you\xe2\x80\x99re faced with a supernatural demon that seemingly defies the laws of physics, you\xe2\x80\x99re not smart enough to figure a way out of this. So go buy a paintball gun at walmart. Drive to a police station and get the attention of the police once the entity is close. Make sure your friends have cameras running too. Once the entity is close, light it up with paint and film it. The entity will now be visible to everyone at the police station, social media, the news, and within 24 hours the whole planet will be aware of this entity. Once the human race is collectively aware of an entity that has incomprehensible powers yet wastes it by walking around killing dumb teens and street hookers, we can begin to defeat it. It\xe2\x80\x99s a bit out of your hands at this point, as they\xe2\x80\x99d probably taze the entity for resisting and throw it in a hulk cage that's monitored 24/7. But how will the big brains discard the monster after researching and stealing its technology? Off the top of my head: I mean i\xe2\x80\x99m positive we will test every form of weapons or conceived method of dematerializing the entity, and something will work. I mean a kid with a revolver could incapacitate it. If we can\xe2\x80\x99t kill it conventionally, we can continuously incapacitate it indefinitely. The most extreme option though. Is Test SpaceX\xe2\x80\x99s latest rocket delivery system by ejecting the payload on a trajectory with the sun or Andromeda, or preferably a black hole. With this entity\xe2\x80\x99s matter entering a black hole, I think you can pat yourself on the back and get a good night\xe2\x80\x99s rest. What do you think? How would you kill the entity from It Follows, let me know in the comments. And while you\xe2\x80\x99re at it, let me know what other movies or games you want me to cover like this. Thanks for watching, later.
