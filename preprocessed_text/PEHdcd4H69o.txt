Story Recapped here. Today, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to explain a horror, mystery, and thriller film called \xe2\x80\x9cThe Cabin in the Woods.\xe2\x80\x9d Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care. At a laboratory facility, engineers Steve Hadley and Gary Sitterson discuss their plans for an annual event to be held that evening. They\xe2\x80\x99re approached by Wendy Lin, head of the chemistry department, who tells them that Stockholm, who\xe2\x80\x99s also holding the same event, has failed. It\xe2\x80\x99s now up to them and another competing country, Japan. The men reassure Lin that they won\xe2\x80\x99t mess it up. Meanwhile, at a nearby university campus, Dana Polk prepares her bag for her upcoming weekend trip with her friends. Her best friend, Jules Louden, helps her pack and shows off her new blonde hair. Jules\xe2\x80\x99s boyfriend, Curt Vaughan, helps them carry their bags. All three hop into the camper van and are joined by their stoner friend, Marty Mikalski, and a transferee student, Holden McCrea. Curt takes the steering wheel as they make their way to his cousin\xe2\x80\x99s cabin in the woods. Unbeknownst to the group, a man watches them leave, contacts someone on his earpiece and tells them that the camper has already left. At the lab, Hadley and Sitterson arrive at the control room and meet Alex Truman, who supervises the event. On the way to the cabin, the group stops by a rundown gas station for a refill. They meet the owner, Mordecai, who is hostile yet tells them the directions. They pass through a mountain tunnel, unaware that they\xe2\x80\x99re now entering an invisible dome. The group finally arrives at the cabin and picks their rooms. Holden goes into his room and spots an eerie painting. Feeling disturbed, he takes it down and discovers a one-way mirror behind it. He shows the group the mirror, and Marty suspects that it must be from the pioneer days. Holden offers to switch rooms with Dana, and she thanks him for being decent. At the lab, Hadley and Sitterson are watching every room through the cameras they\xe2\x80\x99ve hidden throughout the cabin. Lin arrives and reports that Jules\xe2\x80\x99s blood levels are normal, and they\xe2\x80\x99re planning to increase her libido. The employees at the lab make their final betting choices for the night. Truman asks them how they can make a betting contest out of this if they control the outcome. Handley and Sitterson tell him that they only get the lambs into the arena; everything that happens from there on is by choice of their own free will. The group gets the party started by bringing out the booze and turning on the music. They play truth or dare, and Jules decides that it\xe2\x80\x99s Dana\xe2\x80\x99s turn. Just as Dana chooses to dare, the cellar door behind blasts open and interrupts their game. Jules dares Dana to check it out. Not one to chicken out, Dana brings a flashlight and explores the cellar. It\xe2\x80\x99s full of knick-knacks from the previous owners. The group joins her in the basement and explores the mysterious room. Dana picks up a journal, Jules spies on a locket, Holden opens a music box, Curt takes a mysterious puzzle, and Marty spots a couple of film reels. Dana turns their attention to the journal she found, and the group huddles around her. The diary belonged to Anna Patience Buckner, who lived in 1903 with her abusive and sadistic family. She starts to say something in Latin. As she says the last word, the corpses of the Buckner family rise from a nearby grave and drag their way to the cabin. At the lab, the maintenance department cheers as they win the betting pool. It turns out that they betted that the Buckners would be the one to eliminate the group. Lin tells Truman that everything they have in the dungeons is remnants of the old world when the gods roamed the Earth and monsters and magic had the upper hand. As the night goes on, Marty tells Dana that something weird is happening. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t understand why Jules is acting like a dumb blonde when she\xe2\x80\x99s in pre-med and why Curt has suddenly turned into a high school jock when in fact, he\xe2\x80\x99s a sociology major on a full academic scholarship at the university. He shares his theory that there might be puppeteers controlling them, but Dana dismisses his points to the joint that he\xe2\x80\x99s smoking. Meanwhile, the couple starts making out in the woods, unaware that a room full of men is watching them. The engineers turn on the pheromone mists to increase their sexual appetites and light the way to a clearing where the couple can have their little outing. Truman, together with Hadley and Sitterson, watch as Jules and Curt make love on the ground. Right on cue, the Buckners arrive and stab a dagger into Jules\xe2\x80\x99s hands. Jules screams as Curt pins down one of the undead. He gets impaled on the back but manages to punch down the corpse. Jules runs towards her boyfriend, but she\xe2\x80\x99s chained down and dragged by another zombie. The corpses surround her and hold her down, while Curt can only watch in horror as they cut off her head with a saw. The engineers say a little prayer at the lab as they turn on the underground mechanism and drain Jules\xe2\x80\x99s blood into a pipeline below to fill a stone tomb. Back at the cabin, Marty smokes another joint to keep his mind off the voices that he\xe2\x80\x99s hearing. He starts to freak out and decides to take a leak outside. Curt appears, all bloodied and beaten up, and drags him outside just before one of the corpses can take another one of them down. He tells the group that Jules is gone and they should start barricading all the doors and windows in the cabin. Dana refuses to leave and opens the door, only to face another zombie who tosses Jules\xe2\x80\x99s severed head. Dana screams as the boys push against the door. She comes to her senses and helps them lock down the door. Curt tells them that no matter what happens, they have to stay together. Hadley sighs in frustration as he listens to the conversation. This isn\xe2\x80\x99t ideal for them, so Sitterson presses a button that releases gas through the cabin vents that lowers cognition. Curt inhales the gas and suddenly changes his mind. He tells the group that they should split up so that they cover more ground. One of the zombies breaks down the door, and the group separates and hides in their rooms. The engineers press another button and lock the bedroom doors. Marty is in full panic mode and knocks off a lamp as he closes a window shut. As he looks at the broken lamp, he sees a tiny hidden camera. The color is drained from his face as he pulls a long cable hidden within the walls. Marty\xe2\x80\x99s suspicions are correct. Someone is watching them. The window behind bursts open as John Buckner\xe2\x80\x99s corpse drags him outside. Marty narrowly escapes his knife. He hits him with his thermos and runs away. The corpse throws his knife at Marty\xe2\x80\x99s back and pins him down. Marty screams as the corpse drags him back to his grave, and his blood is spilled and drained into the underground stone tomb. The ground rumbles as the gods accept the second sacrifice. Meanwhile, Dana is trapped in her bedroom. Another undead makes its way to her window, and Holden rescues her by breaking the one-way mirror. They find another door on the floor and escape through it. Dana realizes that it\xe2\x80\x99s the torture room from the journal, and there\xe2\x80\x99s no way out. One of the corpses catches Holden and drags him outside, but she manages to stop it by driving a crowbar right into its neck. She grabs a knife and starts stabbing the undead. Suddenly, a door opens in the room and reveals Curt. He leads them through another door, and they finally escape the cabin. They pile into the camper, and Curt steps on the gas so that they could escape this hellhole. Meanwhile, Japan has failed in its sacrifice to the gods. Now it\xe2\x80\x99s up to Hadley and Sitterson. The duo panic as they see the camper heading towards the mountain tunnel and realize that there\xe2\x80\x99s no cave-in. The demolition team was supposed to initiate an explosion a few minutes earlier. Sitterson runs to the pyrotechnics department and fixes the wires himself. He finally gets the operation going, and an explosion erupts in the tunnel just before the group can make their way out. They quickly back away and manage to exit safely. Curt curses out of frustration as they realize that they\xe2\x80\x99re only one jump away from their escape. They come up with a plan, and Curt decides to jump with his motorcycle and then run to town for help. Dana begs Curt to be careful as he steps on the gas. He backs away and fully revs towards the gap between the two roads. Curt makes the jump and almost makes it until he smashes straight into the invisible force field. He is instantly killed and is thrown into the deep trench together with his wrecked motorcycle. Dana screams for her friend as Holden takes her away into the camper. The gods have now received their third sacrifice. In the camper, Dana realizes that Marty was right all along. Someone is watching them and controlling their every move. They will never escape here unless they find a way to reveal who\xe2\x80\x99s behind this. Suddenly, one of the corpses appears behind Holden and stabs him through the throat. The gods have now received their fourth sacrifice. Dana screams as the camper goes out of control and they\xe2\x80\x99re thrown into the lake. She swims up for air and manages to escape. Meanwhile, everyone is celebrating in the control room. Hadley tells Truman that the ritual is now complete. The virgin\xe2\x80\x99s death, in this case, Dana being the virgin, is optional. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter whether she lives or dies; the main thing is that she suffers. It\xe2\x80\x99s now up to fate. Dana swims up to the surface and takes deep breaths as she realizes all of her friends are dead. The corpse has now emerged and starts strangling her. Everything that\xe2\x80\x99s happening is being viewed in the control room as the employees start having a party to celebrate their win. Sitterson approaches the demolition team and jokes with them for almost failing them. The team insists that they didn\xe2\x80\x99t get their order because there was a power glitch from upstairs. One of the college students must have messed up with the wires they have hidden in the killing field. But who can it be when all of them, except Dana, is dead. Suddenly, a call interrupts their party. Hadley stops the celebrations as he answers the call. It\xe2\x80\x99s the Director. It turns out one of the students is still alive, and the ritual isn\xe2\x80\x99t complete. Meanwhile, as Dana crawls her way to one of the loose boards, the corpse collapses behind her. She turns around and sees Marty, who\xe2\x80\x99s still alive. She grabs the board and slams the undead back into the lake. The two make a run for it, and Marty drags her inside one of the graves. He closes the steel door before any more of the corpses can kill them. Dana can only look in horror as she sees a tunnel and the dismembered remains of one of the corpses. She tells Marty that she\xe2\x80\x99s the only one who survived as he tinkers with the control box. It turns out he was the one who created the power glitch that the demolition team was talking about. Dana tells Marty that he was right all along. He shows her the elevator that he discovered and tells her that someone sent those zombies after them. If they want to escape, this is the only way out. They hop into the elevator with the severed zombie arm. The elevator takes them deep into the dungeons as they come face to face with more monsters in glass cages. Dana realizes that whoever is watching them, these people made them choose how they die based on the things they were playing within the cellar. She screams and pounds her fists on the glass as she realizes that she\xe2\x80\x99s the reason why all of her friends are dead. Meanwhile, in the control room, all hell has broken loose. Sitterson sends security to shoot Marty so that the ritual can be completed. Dana must die last so she will not be touched. Lin then informs Hadley that whatever Marty\xe2\x80\x99s been smoking, it\xe2\x80\x99s been making him immune to all their chemical adjustments. The elevator doors soon open, and Dana and Marty come face to face with an armed guard. The zombie\xe2\x80\x99s arm distracts the guard, and he starts shooting at it. They take him out and grab his gun and the zombie\xe2\x80\x99s knife. They find themselves in a hallway of elevators, and a man starts speaking through the speaker system. The man tells them to give up and allow themselves to be sacrificed. The two hide in one of the operator rooms as a whole squad starts firing at them. Dana spots the controls and hits the warning button. All the elevators open and release an army of monsters who instantly takes down the squad. In a matter of minutes, the demons take over entire floors, eliminating and torturing every employee they see. Hadley, Sitterson, and the rest have locked themselves in the control room. Their defenses have been overridden, and there is no way out. Dana and Marty quickly get out of the room and escape through a hole in the hallway. Back at the control room, the monsters have managed to break down the steel door and take Truman down immediately. Hadley fires his gun as Sitterson puts in the code for the escape hatch leading downstairs. An explosion erupts, and Hadley is blasted into the air and is eaten by a merman. Sitterson opens the hatch and escapes as Lin is taken away by a giant octopus. He runs through the dark hall and is stabbed in the chest by a terrified Dana. As he sits down dying, he tells Dana to do the right thing and kill Marty. Marty hands her the gun, and they go further into the tunnel until they find themselves inside a chamber surrounded by five stone tombs with etchings filled with their friends\xe2\x80\x99 blood. The Director reveals herself and finally tells them the truth. Dana, Marty, and the rest of their friends are part of an annual ritual sacrifice. The whore, who is corrupted, dies first, then the athlete, the scholar, the fool, and the virgin. If they don\xe2\x80\x99t make the sacrifice, the gods who rule the Earth will rise again and create havoc, pain, and suffering. She tells them that the sun is coming up in eight minutes, and if Dana wants to survive and save the rest of humanity, she must kill Marty. With a trembling hand, Dana raises the gun at her friend. Marty can only stare in disbelief as he realizes what she\xe2\x80\x99s about to do. As Dana contemplates shooting her friend, a werewolf appears behind her and bites her on the neck. She throws away the gun as Marty fends off the Director and picks it up. He shoots the werewolf and sends it out, whimpering. The Director punches Marty, and a struggle ensues. This time, the corpse of Patience Buckner appears with her ax. The Director grabs the gun and sees her chance, but Marty manages to pull her on top and shield himself as the corpse hacks the ax into her head. He gets away and pushes the two into the raging depths below. Marty backs away and joins Dana on the steps as the room crumbles around them. She apologizes to him for even considering shooting him, but Marty reassures her that he understands. They don\xe2\x80\x99t think humanity is worth saving, and they share one last joint as the end of the world starts around them. The chamber crashes as a giant hand erupts from the depths and obliterates the lab.
