[Music]. hello and welcome to another episode of movie spoiler alerts. today we're talking about the historical period drama film phantom thread. so let's get started. one thing to note, this film is not actually out on blu-ray yet, so I had to work with the available footage to get this out before the Oscars. the film opens in 1950s London with renowned fashion designer Reynold Woodcock, making dresses for high society. Woodcock is controlling, obsessive, demanding man who doesn't really seem to value anyone besides his sister Cyril, who runs the day-to-day operations. he is haunted by his dead mother, and stitches hidden messages into the dresses that he makes after tossing away his previous love interest. Woodcock meets a waitress named Alma. she moves in with him, it becomes his assistant in his muse they eventually begin bickering and fighting, with Woodcock being extremely unappreciative of her, so Alma intentionally poisons him with some mushrooms. Woodcock becomes extremely ill and begins hallucinating about his mother, and Alma nurses him back to health. Woodcock is moved by Alma taking care of him, and then they eventually marry. after a while, they revert back to fighting again, and Alma decides to poison Woodcock again, but this time he has figured out what she is doing. however, he is happy about becoming violently ill and being nurtured, and views it as a sort of stress relief and falls more in love with her. we see that this cycle continues, and eventually leading to them having children as they continue their twisted love. as the film concludes. so that was the spoilers for a phantom thread. if you have another film you'd like to see me spoil, please let me know in the comments below. check out movie's spoiler alerts on our various forms of social media, and remember to Like and subscribe. thanks for watching.
