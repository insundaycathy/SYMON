If you vacationed in a snowy mountain cabin and Nazi Zombies tried to kill you, what would you do? In this How to Beat video, we\xe2\x80\x99ll follow the Norwegion students, see if we can make better decisions, and ultimately attempt to beat the Nazi Zombies in, Dead Snow. If you think you could do better than me, let us know in the comments! If you like these how to beat videos, consider liking and subscribing. Let\xe2\x80\x99s get to it. After witnessing a random woman run down and eaten by zombies that were suspiciously wearing Nazi SS uniforms, we start following seven students vacationing in a cabin in the woods. In the car, Roy tells them about a man in the newspaper who was buried in an avalanche, and was later found to have accidentally dug six yards deeper into the snow because he was disoriented. Vegard\xe2\x80\x99s pro tip is to just spit, and then dig in the opposite direction gravity pulls your saliva. Apparently this is something he learned in his military service. I thought this was common knowledge, or just common sense. How this man dug \xe2\x80\x98six\xe2\x80\x99 yards deep without realizing he should\xe2\x80\x99ve been falling back down is one of the most idiotic things I've heard all week. It\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be a sausage party after all, they got some ladies coming too. There\xe2\x80\x99s mention of a Sara who was going to hike into the cabin on her own. If that was Sara in the prelude, they\xe2\x80\x99re going to be coming up one short. The cabin they\xe2\x80\x99re staying at is a 45 minutes walk off the road. Only Vegard knows the way in and out, so the rest will have to follow his snowmobile tracks. He could have ferried them to the cabin, but that would just get in the way of doing some sick Triple X moves. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he never comes up here and it\xe2\x80\x99s rarely ever used, but it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be hard to pin some red markers on the trees to mark the route so others could get in and out if needed. Or if someone got hurt and emergency services needed to find you. Not only is the route unmarked, but there's no cell signal. Elon Musk really needs to get that Starlink set up so people getting attacked by Things in Antarctica and Nazi Zombies in the Norwegion Alps can call for help. Movie cliches aside, being in remote areas with no ability to call for help and no way of anyone finding you quickly is actually a risky thing in real life. Just because it\xe2\x80\x99s a movie cliche doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make it less dangerous. \xe2\x80\x9cHaha man how many movies are there where some psycho is stalking you with a knife in their hand, that guy following us at night is so cliche, am I right.\xe2\x80\x9d Well I feel attacked. The group burns the rest of the daylight off tubing, grilling wieners, and playing twister until eventually, someone has to use the outdoor laboratory. Nothing good ever comes from using an outhouse at night in the dark freezing woods. At minimum, it\xe2\x80\x99s freezing and uncomfortable. But worst case, you\xe2\x80\x99re alone, in a vulnerable position, and your enemies can take you completely by surprise. Not Liv though, she gets that weird subconscious feeling of being watched. Like something is off. Like anyone would do, she runs back inside yelling about seeing a man outside. Of course everyone tries to come up with reasonable explanations like it being Sara or a Moose, which has to be infuriating. Knowing you saw something but your friends just think you saw a rabbit or the shadow of snow falling off the trees. That or they look out of a musty window and say, Yah, no shit you didn\xe2\x80\x99t see anyone standing in plain view of the window. If there was someone out there they\xe2\x80\x99d be operating in the darkness of the tree line or in the house\xe2\x80\x99s blind spots. With Liv being freaked out about seeing someone outside, they should probably start using the buddy system if anyone else needs to use the port-a-potty tonight, or at least slow down on the booze. I also hope there's an old hunting rifle stashed away in a closet because they don\xe2\x80\x99t have much in the way of weapons if an axe-murderer all of the sudden busts in swinging. Like a true Alpha male, Roy needlessly puts himself in harm's way to prove there isn\xe2\x80\x99t any danger. He gets lucky that the man who snuck up behind him was only looking for a cup of coffee. This dude is completely killing the vibe they had going, but if we\xe2\x80\x99re going with the whole movie cliche thing, he\xe2\x80\x99s definitely the strange old man that\xe2\x80\x99s going to start dropping history lessons about an old evil that\xe2\x80\x99s lurking around these parts. It\xe2\x80\x99d be wise to pay attention. If what this guy said is true, why would he be traveling outside in these parts by himself, unarmed. And why would he willingly leave the relative safety of the cabin. I\xe2\x80\x99d be suspicious of this guy, not the tall tale he was spitting. Everyone but Liv is disregarding this as senile rambling, and even then, she\xe2\x80\x99s probably thinking what she saw in the treeline earlier was the old man himself. Sara hasn\xe2\x80\x99t shown up yet, but Vegard did say that she might be arriving in the morning. As far as they\xe2\x80\x99re concerned, there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to worry about. Before the wanderer leaves, Roy makes another smartass remark that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take too kindly too. Whether his story is true or not, the fact that this guy is roaming around would be scary enough to wanna watch your back from here on out. Naturally, all the disturbing shit the old man was talking about seeped into their minds and propagated into their dreams. What the fuck brain, thanks for the visual of my missing girlfriend dying and puking black blood. I really needed that after being told there might be undead Nazi zombies lurking in these mountains with my girlfriend hiking in by herself. I will say, going hiking through somewhat treacherous terrain by yourself with no cell signal wasn\xe2\x80\x99t too smart. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure she\xe2\x80\x99s fine and this was just a case of an overactive imagination. Really, what is this guy even doing out here? He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look like a hunter to me. Maybe he\xe2\x80\x99s not simply a \xe2\x80\x98hunter\xe2\x80\x99, maybe, he\xe2\x80\x99s a \xe2\x80\x98ghost\xe2\x80\x99 hunter, or whatever the Nazi zombie equivalent of a ghost hunter is. Ah, I know, this guy is like the amateur Norwegion version of the Hunting Hiter crew. He\xe2\x80\x99s no Tim Kennedy though. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to put words in Tim Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s mouth, but I doubt he would have trekked into the heart of these evil mountains by himself, having only brought a bolt-action rifle and a narrow-beam flashlight, and then set up in the middle of the open in a tent lit up like a Christmas tree. That would be the sound of your bad decisions catching up to you. We already know this guy massively fucked up coming here at night and by willingly leaving the cabin to camp in a tent, but let\xe2\x80\x99s just rip through him some more. He should have brought a camping lantern which lights up over 30 meters in all directions. His narrow beam flashlight is next to useless, and coupled with a bolt-action rifle, acquiring, engaging, reloading, reacquiring and re-engaging is going to be absurdly difficult. If what he said is true, there could be hundreds of undead Einsatzkommandos out here. Impossible odds.. Even if he was a regular camper or hunter who was only concerned about dangerous animals, and didn\xe2\x80\x99t actually believe his own stories, he was still poorly equipped. He basically committed suicide. The nightmare, what the old guy said, Sara still not here in the morning, all stoke Vegard into going on a search and rescue mission to try to find her. This is a mistake. He should ride back into town to contact the police, who will notify the Norwegion Search and Rescue Service. The SAR team is vastly more well manned, equipped, and trained for the job. Vegard going after Sara by himself without any real training or equipment is not only dangerous, but he\xe2\x80\x99s also much less likely to find her or be able to effectively rescue her if he does. On his way he finds the wanderer\xe2\x80\x99s tent, and inside, his mutilated corpse. Seeing as there\xe2\x80\x99s bloody footprints walking away from the scene, this was no animal. I know they\xe2\x80\x99re evil Nazi zombies and all, but leaving behind a crime scene isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to do them any favors. They have a leader, are somewhat intelligent, and according to the legends they fled into these mountains to hide at the end of the war. Covering their tracks should be a strat residing in their decaying brain matter. Stupid Nazi\xe2\x80\x99s. Now as Vegard, do you keep snowmobiling around the mountainside searching for Sara with a murdering psycho on the loose, or do you head back and get off the mountain with the rest of your friends so you can get help from people that actually know what the fuck they\xe2\x80\x99re doing? I\xe2\x80\x99m going to go with the latter. For some reason Vegard thinks this is a movie and he\xe2\x80\x99s the hero, and decides to follow the murderer\xe2\x80\x99s foot tracks. It\xe2\x80\x99s not a good sign when you\xe2\x80\x99re resorting to tracking down a murderer to find your missing girlfriend, but it\xe2\x80\x99s the best lead he has. Maybe undertaking the rescue operation by yourself wasn\xe2\x80\x99t such a good idea. Back at the lodge the group discovers a box full of old gold and jewelry dated with the year 1942. No bells are ringing that this might be related to the World War 2 Einsatzgruppe confiscations the wanderer was talking about. Not that it would change anything if it had. There\xe2\x80\x99s no way they could anticipate that undead Nazi\xe2\x80\x99s will rise out of their icy graves and shank them for fucking with their loot. To them, it\xe2\x80\x99s old junk they could pawn off to pay off their student loans, which I\xe2\x80\x99m sure is triggering to any historians out there. While everyone\xe2\x80\x99s playing with the cursed jewelry, Hanna slips one of the coins into Martin's joggers without him knowing. I don\xe2\x80\x99t get why she didn\xe2\x80\x99t put it in her own pocket if she wanted to take one. Liv seeing someone in the woods, the creepy old man sneaking up on them and choking out Roy, and Vegard not being back yet hasn\xe2\x80\x99t unnerved them one bit. They\xe2\x80\x99re all wasted and not using a buddy system when visiting the outhouse a night. Sure, you'd most likely get called a bitch by the other guys for suggesting you tag team the toilet with your bro, but I think it\xe2\x80\x99s reasonable given the circumstances. In the Navy SEAL BUD/S training you get assigned a swim buddy that you can\xe2\x80\x99t be further than 3 feet from the whole 6 months, because they get that when you\xe2\x80\x99re alone you\xe2\x80\x99re weak and vulnerable. Especially when on the John. Damn, Chris is a freak jesus christ. Not what I meant with the buddy system, but it\xe2\x80\x99ll do. Erland heads back into the Cabin to run a victory lap while Chris finishes up on her own, or so she thinks. When she goes for the TeePee she catches a peeping tom, or more technically, a peeping undead Nazi SS paramilitary death squad soldier. The most surprising thing is her lack of blood curdling screams, not that it would help with the rest of the group smashing beers and blasting jams. There\xe2\x80\x99s not much she can do at this point. What do ya know, there was a gun in this old cabin. Hope there\xe2\x80\x99s ammo around and it\xe2\x80\x99s not just for decoration. Hanna tosses Martin the pump trench gun and the boys head out looking for Chris. Their investigation comes up empty, which I find hard to believe. How did Chris get pulled through the toilet hole without breaking anything. And how was her blood not all over the snow leading up to the house. The guys seem to think that them not finding Chris means that everything is chill. I\xe2\x80\x99d think that it would be even more alarming. Especially since they also found Sara\xe2\x80\x99s backpack. Hannah takes a peek outside and sees Chris\xe2\x80\x99s head being waved around by a homicidal maniac. The Nazi zombies sure do have a sick sense of humour. Liv then makes the almost fatal, cliche mistake of having her back next to that same window. Cutting Liv\xe2\x80\x99s hair with the knife to free her was a clutch move, good thinking. Barricading the windows and doors is also good, but everyone needs to find things they can use for shields and weapons. One of them should look around and try to find spare ammo for their shotgun since it\xe2\x80\x99s the best weapon they have. I doubt there is any, so Martin needs to be sparing with it and only shoot when he sees the whites of their undead eyes. Once all the entrances are sufficiently barricaded up, everyone needs to huddle in the middle to one, avoid getting grabbed like Liv, and two, so that Martin has a clear shot. Beyond that there\xe2\x80\x99s not much to do but hold out until morning. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never heard of Nazi vampires, so the sunlight can\xe2\x80\x99t be relied upon to vaporize them, but Vegard might be back with the snowmobile, they\xe2\x80\x99d have better visibility, and more people would be awake that could potentially help them. Whatever is attacking them, it likely doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to be spotted in broad daylight. Now it\xe2\x80\x99s clear they\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with zombies, and judging by the decayed hand with the Einsatz ring, the Nazi variety. Erland, having watched his fair share of movies, starts freaking out yelling at everyone to not get bitten. Hey, that\xe2\x80\x99s my job. Based on what the wanderer man said, this is looking a lot more like an evil curse, not a virus. Not that you\xe2\x80\x99d want to get bitten by a Nazi zombie. Zombies are just a breeding ground for bacteria and infectious diseases. Hannah thinks they should run for the car, which is a total joke. There\xe2\x80\x99s no way they can make it trudging for 45 minutes through the snow at night while being attacked when they don\xe2\x80\x99t even know the way out without Vegard. Besides that automatic fail, they have no idea how many of them are actually out there, it\xe2\x80\x99s dark as hell and they have no flashlights, the shotgun doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have enough ammo and Martin doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have the training to operate it under duress, and they\xe2\x80\x99re all booz\xe2\x80\x99d up, unarmed, and out of shape. Good thing Hannah isn\xe2\x80\x99t team lead, because that would\xe2\x80\x99ve been a total massacre. Erland makes the same mistake as Liv by standing too close to the window, but he\xe2\x80\x99s not as lucky as she was. Running to the car is out of the question. This zombie just pulled his head apart like it was a watermelon. That\xe2\x80\x99s like game of thrones mountain levels of strength. And there\xe2\x80\x99s tons of these freaks out there. They just need to hold out till morning. To be honest, I'm somewhat shocked that they survived the night. Colonel Herzog is a dipshit, no wonder they lost the war. All they needed to do is molotov the cabin and smoke them out. Or tossed one of their stick grenades in through a window to stun them before charging in to rip their guts out. I honestly never thought i\xe2\x80\x99d have a job which entailed helping Nazi zombies kill innocent civilians. Dreams really do come true. With snowfall covering the snowmobile tracks and obscuring the path back to civilization, they plan to split up. The gals will make a run for where they think is town, while Martin and Roy create a diversion to buy them some time. If only someone marked the route in an out. Not that it would help much if the Nazi things decided to hunt them in broad daylight, but it would have given them a sliver of a chance. Thinking about it, they weren\xe2\x80\x99t blindfolded for the 45 minute walk in. They should have at least a general sense of direction of where they came from. The distraction idea is also flawed. Creating a diversion only works if you know where the Nazi\xe2\x80\x99s are located. Liv and Hannah could easily be running right towards the zombies, in which case Martin and Roy banging on pots and pans isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to help. Their best option is to stay together, grab weapons from the shed, and haul ass in the general direction they came while daylights on their side. Damn Vegard was unconscious for like 12 hours. Must\xe2\x80\x99ve really jacked his head on something. Looks like some sort of tunnel network. Could it be, the old man wasn\xe2\x80\x99t lying? Using a stick and some gas from his snowmobile he fashions a makeshift torch to go tomb raiding. The unearthed graves are odd. There\xe2\x80\x99s Nazi flags, machineguns, grenades, helmets, yah the old dude wasn\xe2\x80\x99t lying. Vegard should grab the MP40 before he inevitably runs into the murderer. It\xe2\x80\x99s not reasonable for Vegard to jump to conclusions and think he\xe2\x80\x99s dealing with Nazi zombies, but it could be another Hiroo Onoda situation where some old ass Nazi\xe2\x80\x99s held out and survived in these tunnels this whole time by mugging and murdering the occasional hiker. Honestly, the Norwegions should have hunted them down after World War 2. Why would you let a group of genocidal maniacs roam free miles from your town. Vegard eventually finds Saras head, on display as some sort of sick trophy. As heart stopping as this revelation is, there\xe2\x80\x99s no time to grieve in the devil\xe2\x80\x99s lair. Not too help the Nazi\xe2\x80\x99s, but If they still have functioning firearms, why aren\xe2\x80\x99t they using them? Odd that they\xe2\x80\x99d want to use knives with the historical precedent of mowing down millions of innocent people with rifles. Using his military training and the fire of vengeance ignited from Sara\xe2\x80\x99s death, Vegard beats the zombie down with it\xe2\x80\x99s own helmet. The Norwegion military apparently doesn\xe2\x80\x99t train to double-tap their downed enemies. It\xe2\x80\x99s an undead monster, you can\xe2\x80\x99t expect it to be fully dead from knocking it\xe2\x80\x99s head around a bit. His victory is short-lived with another undead Nazi climbing out of the snow next to him. Yah, time to run back to the snowmobile and Triple X your ass back to base. Who knows how many of them are buried in these tunnels. The Nazi\xe2\x80\x99s corner him before he can get to his snowmobile, so he\xe2\x80\x99s forced to face them head on. Defeating them is surprisingly easy. The problem with Nazi zombies is that their brains have decayed to the point where they turn into shitty movie villains who throw their enemies towards weapons that can be used against them. That was basically a layup for Vegard. The throwing knife to the face was a pro move, especially considering he\xe2\x80\x99s cold, exhausted from fighting, wearing thick gloves, on an uneven snowy hillside, and stressed from being under attack by undead Nazi\xe2\x80\x99s. I\xe2\x80\x99ve thrown axes before and it\xe2\x80\x99s a lot harder than it looks. I personally wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have done that because I\xe2\x80\x99d have fucked it up and ended up just giving it the knife. He gets tackled off a cliff but manages to grab on to the other zombie\xe2\x80\x99s intestines Tarantino style. Hopefully this is an evil curse thing and not an infectious zombie virus thing, because there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of bodily fluids being exchanged. He head butts the zombie off, climbs back up, and performs some extreme field surgery by stitching his carotid artery closed with a fishing line and hook using his snowmobiles mirror. Hell of a day. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s possible to stitch a chewed open carotid artery closed in the field like that. The duct tape around his neck might help a bit, but it\xe2\x80\x99s just a matter of time before he bleeds out. He needs to get to a hospital A.S.A.P. if he has any chance of surviving. Vegard knows his friends must also be under attack, and that nobody would believe him if he went for help. So rather than save himself he mounts a confiscated belt-fed MG-34 on his snowmobile and prepares for war. There\xe2\x80\x99s still that MP40 and possibly more guns, grenades and ammo that he should\xe2\x80\x99ve stocked up on but doesn\xe2\x80\x99t. Crucial mistake. When he fires her up for one last ride, another buried Nazi smells the fresh blood and thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s his moment to shine. The zombie catching a facefull of tree-branch was lucky. This is also why he should have brought that submachine gun. The MG-34 isn\xe2\x80\x99t really made for blasting people off your snow boots. As expected, the diversion was a total failure. Hannah is putting in work though. That\xe2\x80\x99s the other thing about zombies, their bodies have decayed so much that their heads pop like water balloons when you stomp on them. They really should have grabbed knives or something from the tool shed to defend themselves with. Liv isn\xe2\x80\x99t doing as well, getting cannibalized by the undead SS and all. The Nazi\xe2\x80\x99s are too preocuppied indulging on her tasty flesh to notice that she swiped one of their potato mashers. By the time they do, the 4 and a half second fuze is burnt through. I\xe2\x80\x99m a bit surprised Liv knew how to detonate the grenade. World war 2 stick grenades aren\xe2\x80\x99t as intuitive as modern ones where most people know to pull the pin and let the lever fly. With stick nades you have to unscrew the inconspicuous looking bottom cap and pull the string that comes out. Hannah hides in a tree which somehow works. These Nazi\xe2\x80\x99s must be blind to not see her. She\xe2\x80\x99s wearing a giant puffy red coat. Hannah really should\xe2\x80\x99ve taken that off. Being cold is better than being dead. She accidentally climbs up next to a bird nest, causing mama crow to get pissed and start cawing loudly. By the time she chokes it out, the zombies already found her. The tree isn\xe2\x80\x99t the greatest hiding spot because you\xe2\x80\x99re basically trapped if you get caught. That and your footprints in the snow will obviously lead to the tree and then suddenly stop. Hannah had no idea where she was going and was exhausted by this point, so the tree probably looked like her only option. She does have the high ground.. And expertly uses it to perform a super smash bros link drop sword maneuver. I can\xe2\x80\x99t say I would\xe2\x80\x99ve thought to do that. She accidentally backs herself into a corner, and knowing she can\xe2\x80\x99t take it on one v one, takes it with her off the cliff. Must\xe2\x80\x99ve been a thick layer of pow that cushioned that fall. According to a physics.stackexchange post, falling at terminal velocity into 15-20 feet of snow should be survivable. Don\xe2\x80\x99t try that at home though. Problem with surviving a huge fall into snow is that you need to dig your broken ass back out. Hope she knows the spit trick. The zombie survived the fall too, but Hannah got out first so she gets a free penalty kick to it\xe2\x80\x99s head. The boys aren't doing so hot themselves. Roy does the Nazi\xe2\x80\x99s job for them by burning themselves out of the shelter with a poorly thrown molotov. Martin then pulls out his Nokia and rings the cops. You\xe2\x80\x99re telling me you did have a cell signal this whole time? Why the fuck didn\xe2\x80\x99t you call the police when you first got attacked? Wow. He then takes this critical opportunity to start yelling at the cops that they are under attack by zombies in German world war 2 uniforms, and gets hung up on. Roy is right, if you\xe2\x80\x99re being attacked by Nazi zombies, don\xe2\x80\x99t say you\xe2\x80\x99re being attacked by Nazi zombies. The thing is, even if Martin told them a hiker had gone mad and attacked them and the police were ready to respond, he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be able to give them his location, because he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know it. And even if he did, without route markers finding this place will be difficult and take awhile. It\xe2\x80\x99s also crazy to me that nobody had a paper map of this area. The Nazi zombies failed to secure the perimeter, so Roy and Martin are able to flee to the shed stocked with killing devices. An all out war between the Norwegion students and the undead Nazi\xe2\x80\x99s ensues, waged with crude instruments of farming and fieldwork. The undead get clobbered rather easily, almost, too easily. Even though killing them isn\xe2\x80\x99t too difficult, more keep rising out of the snow. If you ventured into some of my random earlier videos I made, you\xe2\x80\x99ll notice one called, \xe2\x80\x9cYour Heroes will Die Tired\xe2\x80\x9d. The point I tried to make is that hand to hand fighting is extremely taxing and exhausting. Your average person, AKA you, would be completely smoked and out of energy after a couple hand to hand bouts with the enemy, to the point where if another attacker came at you, it would be very easy for them to overpower and kill you. Roy and Martin are running on fumes. Just when all hope seems lost, Vegard flies in with the upgunned snowmobile and saws down a line of zombies. That should buy them enough time for Martin and Roy to get on the snowmobile and drive out of there. Vegard instead decides to pop a wheelie and decapitate another Nazi with it\xe2\x80\x99s skis. The snowmobile gets pinned into a tree, so Vegard suplexes the next zombie, plants the snowmobile treads on its face and opens the throttle. I\xe2\x80\x99m almost feeling sorry for them at this point. Vegard wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have had to wreck his snowmobile if he had brought more ammo, guns, and grenades from the tunnels, or if he executed a hot extract for Roy and Martin and peaced out. Now they are\xe2\x80\x99 unarmed and on foot with zombies popping out of the snow everywhere. Not good. Nooo, Vegard was a badass. Why\xe2\x80\x99d they have to do my boy like that. Hannah arrives at the party with a hatchet in her neck, must\xe2\x80\x99ve caught that on the way back. Looks like it\xe2\x80\x99s all down to Roy and Martin. Martin unloads the trench gun into the SS zombies, but there\xe2\x80\x99s only 5 or so shells in it. Not enough to kill them all. One of the remaining SS zombies tackles him to the ground and bites his arm. Remembering what Erland said about zombies and not getting bitten, he fires up the chainsaw to self-amputate his arm so as to not let the infection spread. Did he not just get zombie guts poured into his facial orifices? If this was a zombie virus thing, you\xe2\x80\x99re already infected. I still think it\xe2\x80\x99s more reasonable to assume the Nazi\xe2\x80\x99s are undead due to a curse, not a virus. In which case there is no need to amputate. Even if you assumed the worst case scenario that you contracted the zombie virus, chopping your arm off is a bullshit movie cliche and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work at all. Blood pumps through your body extremely fast, and likewise, so do pathogens. For example, drugs injected into your arm will reach your brain in a few seconds. Guess they didn\xe2\x80\x99t cover that in your med school. His efforts, stupid yet commendable, are rendered obselete when another zombie rise from the grave beneath his legs and sinks it\xe2\x80\x99s teeth into his sack. Yah, let's go with the evil curse thing. The movie cliche I would go with, is that killing Herzog would end the curse, deading all the undead for good. If they want to live and end this thing, they need to kill him now before his backup arrives in force. Martin and Roy freeze up, lose their only opportunity, and are forced to run for it. Roy gets sideswiped by Herzog and his intestines get caught up on a tree, not sure how that happened. Martin looks back and see\xe2\x80\x99s Herzog grab some loot out of his pockets. It looks like he connected the dots with the wanderers story, that all this was over the confiscated valuables. Damn Nazi zombies, all you had to do was ask. This is the crux of the situation, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t really think there was a point in the movie besides when Martin saw Herzog take the loot out of Roy's pocket, that this was clear. And really, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think this mattered much at all. Sara, the hiker, and Vegard were all attacked before anyone pulled out the box of confiscated goods. The undead nazi curse seems more territorial in nature. Martin races back to the burnt down cabin and offers up the box of gold and jewelry. Herzog accepts and reluctantly spares his life. The movie ends with Martin reaching his car, grabbing the keys out of his pocket, and realizing he was still in possession of one of the coins. That\xe2\x80\x99s why I always put the car in drive immediately after I get in. So if someone pops up on my driver-side window I can just jam the pedal and peel out. It is understandable that Martin wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be in the headspace to do that, having had his entire reality take a hard left with all his friends getting murdered by Nazi zombies. That and he was spared by Herzog. So how could things have gone down differently? Sara really shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been hiking alone, but it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have mattered if she had a friend. Her death was inevitable. When Sara didn\xe2\x80\x99t show up the morning after the wanderer told his tale, Vegard should have rode into town and gotten the help of the police and Norwegion Search and Rescue team. I could see the rest of the friends staying at the cabin in the meantime in case Sara did show up, but they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been alone as police and SAR teams would be scouring the mountains looking for her. With the night approaching and Sara still gone, I think it would be reasonable to cancel the trip and head back into town. I can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine I'd wanna drink beer and play twister with my friend missing. If they changed course at this pivotal point in their decision tree, none of them would have died. Except for the Wanderer who was out camping there like an idiot. If they did stay and Vegard went off looking for Sara on his own, which I suppose could be reasonable, Erland and Chris\xe2\x80\x99s deaths were unavoidable. If Vegard had put up route markers or the others retained a semblance of direction, it would be a 20 minute run to the car. Could they have made it, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s possible given that the Nazi zombies weren\xe2\x80\x99t that coordinated or hard to kill, especially if they all stayed together and got weapons from the shed. When Vegard arrived at the cabin and noticed it was empty, he would\xe2\x80\x99ve rode back to town and made it to a hospital. Once they all got off the mountain and alerted the authorities, the military would have rolled in and closed Herzog\xe2\x80\x99s casket for good. I think we could have beaten the Nazi Zombies from Dead Snow. Thanks for watching, and remember, don\xe2\x80\x99t play dress up with jewelry stolen from innocent civilians that were murdered by Nazi paramilitary death squads.
