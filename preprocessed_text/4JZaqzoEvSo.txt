as the witch hunt game got underway, everything was becoming chaotic. the residents of the beach guessed that monica's best friend, asahi, is the witch. but usagi intervened and anne revealed to everyone that hatter was murdered. the murder of hatter rallied the other members of the beach against the militants, especially once they learned that the bullet used to kill hatter is the same caliber as the ammo used by the militants. once anuji arrives, the militants begin butchering everyone and tossing the corpses into the fire to try to win the witch hunt game. usagi attempted to find arisa, and anne tried to take a more scientific approach by dusting the murder weapon for fingerprints, as she was a policewoman. she and kuna were confronted and stopped by the psychotic, tattooed, sword-wielding militant last boss. and kuana stood her ground, while anne escaped elsewhere. kizhiya confronted naragi on the roof as he took sniper shots at the fleeing crowd below. naragi had his flashback of being bullied in school causing him to become violent. last boss has a hard time with kuina, who, a flashback, revealed that she was a transgender and left her house after a falling out with her martial art master father. last boss also had his flashback being a struggling story writer who may have died from overwork. meanwhile, kaiseia burned naragi with a homemade flamethrower. musaji manages to rescue arisu. after a lot of searching, he reasoned that the witch was being forced to participate against her will, like the taggers earlier in episode two. as arisu pondered what he would do if he were the witch, we got a very brief flashback of a gunny and hatter. as a gunny stared sorrowfully into the pyre of burning bodies, just as aerosol was speculating, and figured out the culprit. but before she could tell anyone, she was knocked unconscious. arisu declared that he knows who the witch is. the episode ended on this cliffhanger.
