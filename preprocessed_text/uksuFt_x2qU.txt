Aladdin is one of my favorite films: it's a beautifully animated, well-crafted musical that focuses on the eponymous Aladdin, who like a lot of Disney protagonists is an orphan, however what's curious is that although we know about his father, we hardly know anything about his mother so who was Aladdin's mother and what happened to her? The first time that we really learn anything about Aladdin's mother is in third film of the franchise Aladdin and the King of Thieves where we meet Aladdin's father Cassim, who tells him that she died when Aladdin was a kid sometime after Cassim had left his family to form the Forty Thieves. However, in the Disney comic series released from 1994 to 1995, he meets a young version of his mother in the past after a time-traveling adventure. At the end of which he never realizes that the woman he met Zena is his mom, who originally was going to be a character in the first film. where she was portrayed as a stout woman that would have played a big role in the story. In earlier versions of the script, she was going to be what drove Aladdin into going into the Cave of Wonders because in that version of the script she would have been a poor, hard-working rug maker who would send Aladdin to sell a rug only for him to get swindled and come back with nothing and with little else to sell she would have been forced to sell her engagement ring and this would lead up to a fight with Aladdin getting scolded by his mother and he would go out to reclaim the ring during which he would sing a song that was eventually cut from the film: Proud of Your Boy and the sequence with the song would have followed Aladdin as he travels around Agrabah and makes a promise to his mother and to himself to be a better so and the power of the Genie's lamp would have been the perfect way for Aladdin to fulfill that promise and give her all that she could want: the perfect life, the perfect home, and the perfect son that she never had although this would have been a point of conflict between the two of them as she would have been there when Aladdin makes his wish to be a prince as well as in a scene criticizing his decision to mislead Princess Jasmine. A scene which in the final cut of the film had the Genie doing the criticizing. It's a shame that all these great ideas and the song were cut they would have added more heart to the story and depth to Aladdin's character. I mean a major theme of Aladdin is this idea of wanting more more respect, more freedom, to be more and to be recognized for who you are and not what you are and "Proud of Your Boy" not only fits in perfectly with this theme, it gives us insight into Aladdin as a person it speaks to his anxieties and although in the final cut of the film we do have the "One Jump (Reprise)" which fulfills a similar role it doesn't have the same gravitas even though the song and Aladdin's mother were never in the official theatrical release, these ideas retro actively elevate Aladdin in my eyes it makes me appreciate the character, the story, and the movie as a whole it's not just a fun little film for kids with great production values it's a film with an empathetic protagonist that understands what that protagonist feels and when I take into consideration all of these things: the things that were cut the things that were included, the things that, well, never were It makes me realize why story like Aladdin is so timeless With that said, thank you so much for watching.
