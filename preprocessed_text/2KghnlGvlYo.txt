Wulan checked the flight path they were going to pass because the weather report said that there was a very strong cloud movement on the route they were going to pass, precisely in the Tibetan mountain path so that it showed the activities of airplane passengers at the airport who were busy taking care of their flight administration such as taking care of baggage boarding passes.  then wait in the waiting room After all administrative processes have been completed Hi 05.05 the pilots and all flight crews have walked into the plane the flight attendants did a thorough check on all passenger seats and the plane cabin as well checked all emergency equipment and also food supplies for passengers elsewhere where the pilots were checking in the cockpit of the plane followed by external checks of the plane carried out by the co-pilot, it seemed that all the planes were fine without any problems. did a briefing to all the crew then the passengers were seen starting to enter the plane a total of all passengers on the plane at that time amounted to 119 people the plane door was closed the pilots continued to communicate with the Air Traffic Controller crew before taking off and at five 26 minutes the plane with flight code qnh 1018 Finally taking off from chongqing Hai international airport now the Sichuan Airlines 8633 plane has been connected to the chengdu traffic tower to communicate until it reaches its destination everything seems to be running smoothly without any problems.  in the slightest but at an altitude of 9200 m with an aircraft speed of 748 KPJ there was a very great turbulence that made all passengers start to fear the pilot turned off the auto pilot feature and then asked the chengdu edition for permission to raise their altitude to an altitude of 9800 m after this was done the condition of the aircraft began to improve  and despite the great turbulence earlier, the heel reactivated the plane's auto pilot feature in the plane's cabin, the flight attendants had started to move to serve the passengers. Hi Meanwhile in the cockpit of the plane Captain Liu was chatting casually with the copilot suicen Captain Lu told me that he had often passed Tibetan mountain route In fact he has passed that route hundreds of times, but in the past he used a bomber or fighter plane when he was still serving in the Chinese Air Force as a senior Captain Liu gave advice and also tips to the suicen copilot to become a senior.  even more professional pilots at that time they were at an altitude of 9800 feet they were passing through the Tibetan mountain path smoothly suddenly the windshield of the plane cracked even though there was no impact at that time the captain immediately reported the matter to the chengdu tower and asked to make an emergency landing at chengdu Hai airport not long after that suddenly the windshield of the plane broke and half of the copilot suicen was sucked out of the plane luckily he was restrained by the seat belt he was wearing and he was also detained by Captain Liow Captain Liu carried out a maneuver to equalize the pressure outside and inside the plane but this  This made the copy door open which resulted in chaos in the passenger cabin of the plane continuing to dive uncontrollably then Captain Liu pulled the plane wide which finally managed to make the copilot back into the plane while trying to get into the cockpit and he finally managed to do it.  he then put oxygen masks on the suicen co-pilot and also Captain Liu chengdu edition officer then prepared the plane's emergency landing by delaying the flight of other planes and also delaying the landing of other planes they also deployed fire brigade medical teams and also police officers efficient officers also asked for force control  the air force to clear their flight path by asking all training aircraft to return to Base because the aircraft could not be contacted by the control tower team the pilots on other planes in the air tried to contact them but to no avail the news of the Sichuan Airlines plane crash slowly began to spread  to the public and eventually became the main topic on social media. The information also reached the passengers' relatives, which of course made them very panicked because they were worried that something might happen to their relatives back to the plane.  wat 8633 there is a new problem they are facing, namely there is a storm cloud that they have to go through knowing that the chengdu edition can only surrender and leave all decisions to the pilot the captain at uh the water decided to turn the plane around to avoid the storm Meanwhile in the cabin  the plane was in chaos because there was a passenger smoking Hi other passengers but luckily the glue on the plane managed to calm all the passengers until finally the conditions in the cabin returned to conducive back to the topic of the plane looking kerten Liu who began to lose consciousness due to the very strong air pressure and high temperature very cold he tried to wake the Captain so that he did not lose consciousness and the effort was successful after Captain you regained consciousness He decided to brave the storm because based on his observations there was a gap that he could use to crash into the storm. However, when the plane entered the storm, turbulence was very intense, exceeding the previous turbulence. It caused the cabin to be shattered. In addition, the plane disappeared from the radar, which made the efficient officers even more resigned, but thanks to the ability of Captain Liu and of course also the blessing of God, the plane ended. managed to get out of the terrible storm the plane reappeared inside but unfortunately it was not a happy ending to the bad journey of the Sichuan Airlines plane Because now in front of them there is a mountain they have to cross Captain you immediately pulled the plane lever to make the plane fly faster  high and was able to pass through the mountain and finally the plane made it through the mountain now The plane was about to land at the airport but again they got a problem where the plane was traveling at a very high speed and it was feared that the plane  wat could not be stopped properly the firefighters and other teams were seen already at the airport to prepare to assist the emergency landing. 7.16 watt landed at chengdu airport but again there was a problem where the airbreak of the plane did not work which made the speed of the plane on the runway very difficult  was taken down which also made one of the plane tires explode but fortunately finally the airbrush could be used and the plane was able to but before running out of runway the revision officers immediately cheered with joy after the Sichuan Airlines plane successfully landed at Captain You Airport and apologized to all passengers for not being able to deliver  they did not forget to go to their actual destination, the captain also thanked the passengers for flying with them, the passengers then gave appreciation to the captain and also the entire crew on duty for saving their lives  outside the plane passengers wait for Captain Liu to exit copied and after he exits passengers salute the captain and co-pilot for successfully landing the plane safely A year later the pilots and everyone else gathered together at a restaurant to celebrate the first anniversary of the chance of their lives the second and that's the end of the captain's film okay, that was the d'captain film which can be taken a lesson that a firmness in a problem will definitely end well like what Captain Liu did where he did not give up trying to control the plane despite the conditions  what he faced at that time was very bad but in the end the Captain's determination paid off with a sweet result where he finally managed to land the plane safely and managed to save all the passengers and crew. ai
