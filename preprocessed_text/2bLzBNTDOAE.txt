Welcome Back fellow Movie Lovers. Today we Recap the latest Amazon Prime Movie \xe2\x80\x98The Tomorrow War\xe2\x80\x99 featuring the talented Chris Pratt. So Buckle up, Beware of spoilers and join us on our Journey in to the Future to save mankind\xe2\x80\x99s very existence! The Tomorrow War Starts with Dan Forester (Chris Pratt), a former soldier now science teacher who\xe2\x80\x99s at home watching the Final of the 2022 FIFA World Cup, when an anomaly interrupts Brazil\xe2\x80\x99s last minute winning attack. The mesmerising anomaly spits out not aliens, but soldiers from 30 years in the future, bringing with them the devastating news that Mankind is about to wiped from existence, the only thing that can stop this from happening is the people of the present. It turns out WE are the Worlds Last Hope. Through news reports it\xe2\x80\x99s pointed out that only 50% of the military qualify to assist in the fight in the future, and because of this a worldwide draft will be called, signing up civilian\xe2\x80\x99s form all around the globe to \xe2\x80\x98Jump\xe2\x80\x99 in to the future to assist the war, and though conscription only lasts for 7 days, less than 20% of those that jump will ever return from fighting the WhiteSpikes. While sleeping, Dan is woken by his daughter having a nightmare that her family will be drafted into the War, oh how right will she turn out to be! It turns out everyone is devastated that the World will in less than 30 years be destroyed, so while teaching his class, Dan turns to his class for a discussion to talk about anything. No one wants to speak except for \xe2\x80\x98Martin\xe2\x80\x99 who loves talking about volcano\xe2\x80\x99s! He knows everything about Volcano\xe2\x80\x99s! I wonder how this will affect things later in the movie\xe2\x80\xa6.. It\xe2\x80\x99s then Dan receives a message as he\xe2\x80\x99s about to be drafted. While being tested for his Draft (this is done by strapping him to a machine and having him prodded and poked), Dan finds out that he is due to die in 7 years\xe2\x80\x99 time, and because his children have already been born he is made eligible to be drafted. He then has a teleportation device pinned in to his Arm, which will allow him to time jump to the future and back after his 7 days of conscription comes to an end, but only if he is still alive. From here Dan returns home to break the devastating news to his family, if he tries to evade the draft his wife or daughter will be forced to take his place. Still trying to keep his wife happy he visits his estranged father, who himself has PTSD from Vietnam and abandoned his son when he was young. Though able to remove the device, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t, and Dan is forced to return home to say his goodbye to his family, his daughter the most. At training, they are given 7 days to train in preparation, but are not allowed to see the enemy in which they are likely to face. But the good news there is no rigorous training, and they can all basically wear whatever they want! It\xe2\x80\x99s here we meet a few new characters from Charlie the quirky best friend who is not cut out for fighting to Dorian who is about to jump and start his 3rd tour! But unfortunately, after less than 24 hours of basically no training at all, an alert comes through from the future to let everyone know that The Last Research Centre in Miami Beach is about to fall and every soldier is needed. During the jump though a malfunction happens and those that jump are dropped 100\xe2\x80\x99s of feet in the sky! Luckily for Dan and 20+ others they land in a pool on top of a skyscraper! Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry, don\xe2\x80\x99t think too much about it and you will find yourself enjoying it! Upon landing the team is immediately contacted by a Colonel Who directs them on their mission to save he \xe2\x80\x98team\xe2\x80\x99 of scientists. Dan leads the way through the destroyed streets, but when they arrive at the test Lab the team has been killed but their bodies are still there, meaning the Whitespikes are coming back. After collecting some test Tubes they head out, it\xe2\x80\x99s here they encounter their first Whitespike. After a tough encounter they are to rendezvous for pickup, but at the last second the convoy is attacked, leaving Dan and a small group to find their own way out of Town. After several sacrifices Dan, Charlie and Dorian manage to escape, passing out before waking up at a Command Station! It\xe2\x80\x99s here Dan finds out why Dorian keeps jumping, he has terminal Cancer and has less than 6 months to live and wants to die on his own terms. It\xe2\x80\x99s here Dan meets the Colonel who was guiding them through Miami Beach, who turns out to be no other than Dan\xe2\x80\x99s now 30 years older daughter, Colonel Muri Forester. Though it\xe2\x80\x99s not the happiest of Reunions as Dan finds out in his future, he was to run out on both his wife and daughter before his death. After the unhappy re-union Dan joins his daughter on a dangerous mission to capture a Female Whitespike, they are bigger and deadlier than the males and attract all the males to her. It\xe2\x80\x99s here Muri informs her Dad that she\xe2\x80\x99s brought him back for a reason, one she will tell him when he needs to know. During the mission to capture the Female, Muri finds herself in danger and Dan trying to become Dad of the year jumps in to the Females pit to save his daughters life, before they quickly escape, she then proceeded to tell him how hard it was for her to see him die when she was only young. Back at their water base with the female Whitespike, Muri and Dan use the time to create a toxin that will kill the creature with one injection! This does allow for Dad and Daughter bonding, while Dan realises how he\xe2\x80\x99s more like his father than he realised. Just as they create a toxin that will kill off the creatures, thousands upon thousands of Males swarm the base, all while Dan only has a short while till his tour of Duty is up and he\xe2\x80\x99s pulled back to present. Its now Muri tells her dad the reason she brought him here, to help create the toxin and take it back to kill the Aliens before the war ever happens, saving the World in past but stopping the future from ever happening. As the Aliens swarm the base, Dan is trying to buy enough time till he\xe2\x80\x99s pulled back to the present, in the fight though Muri is mortally wounded and as she is dragged to her death, Dan is pulled away. He arrives back in the present a broken man, as well as Charlie and Dorian who have both survived! The future has been destroyed, the time travel machine will no longer work, the future is over\xe2\x80\xa6Dan re-unites with his family as a broken man and the film ends with hope that they can use the toxin to save the world\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6. Oh wait your telling me that isn\xe2\x80\x99t how it ends? There\xe2\x80\x99s still 40 minutes left? Ok Ok! Dan and his wife realise the Aliens reached earth years before they actually attacked and through science and Martin the volcano Kid, they know where they are! Dan not getting help from the Government as the world is in a crisis, finds both Charlie and Dorian, and with the help of his own father and those from the future who are stuck in our time, head to where the Alien ship crashed years before. After finding the ship and not wanting to wait for help, they find their way inside, realising the Aliens are a weapon of another Alien race. As they start to inject the toxins the Whitespikes start to wake up, Dan gets out of the ship to where both his father and Charlie have just let a female Whitepsike escape, all while Dorian and the others go out in a blaze of glory destroying the ship and all the aliens except for the one that got away. Dan and his father hunt down the last before she lay an egg and after nearly dying 278 times manage to kill the last female Whitespike saving the World! The government take the credit for saving the world as Dan\xe2\x80\x99s father meets his granddaughter, and they all lived happily ever after. Overall, The Tomorrow war is an enjoyable action film mixed with brilliant visuals and a good bit of humour. As long as you switch your mind off to the inconsistencies and many of the paradoxes you will have an enjoyable time! Though at just over two hours is possibly a bit on the long side!
