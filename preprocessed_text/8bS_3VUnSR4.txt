Welcome to Slash Forward. In this episode we\xe2\x80\x99re going to keep things simple and, perhaps, intimate as we look at a little indie film with only six characters and one primary location. It\xe2\x80\x99s a straightforward film about a couple who kidnaps another couple and get themselves stranded in a service station while attempting to avoid a predatory mold that absorbs our nutrients and takes over and reforms biological material. Of course you must realize I\xe2\x80\x99m describing the 2008 creature feature Splinter. How could you survive an attack from a semi-sentient fungus that can take you over slowly from a single prick, or through directly attacking you as amalgamation of various parts and pieces that used to be your friends. We\xe2\x80\x99re about to go on a journey with a quartet of fine people who are forced to struggle with just that question. Let me know if you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen this one and what you thought in the comments below. And if you like any part of this video, hitting the like button would help me out a lot. Let\xe2\x80\x99s get to it. We open at a Sherman service station somewhere out in BFE. The clerk\xe2\x80\x99s having a lazy afternoon and settles into his lawn chair for some relaxin, which is hard to do with your back to the wilderness. A noise attracts his attention, but he\xe2\x80\x99s no fool - he approaches cautiously, but gets his lower extremities shredded nonetheless. As he suffers we get little bits of a driving scene where we can almost make out what\xe2\x80\x99s happening, before the sports ute enters the perimeter of one of those old experimental extraction sites owned by the oil companies. While I\xe2\x80\x99m sure this was marked on the map, they still pull about twenty feet off of a nearby service road to post up for (what basically equates to camping in their backyard) some bunny hill camping. After giving Seth wood, he and Polly almost immediately get to rolling around in the wild grasses. Meanwhile, Dennis and his girl Lacey find their engine destroyed while on their way to Mexico. Determined to salvage the weekend, Dennis insists they get out and walk it. At the campsite the tent almost makes Seth give in and head out to the nearest motel. But it is their anniversary and Polly desires to make love in the moonlight. So they soldier on, but end up destroying their only tent, which now severely limits their options. Not a man to travel heavy, D chucks their belongings into the woods so they can move swiftly. Lacey is upset with this turn of events, but D wins her over with some classic little pet names. Always the gentleman, he even makes sure she\xe2\x80\x99s nice and warm, even though his shirt is fully saturated. On their way back to civilization, Seth hits his lady with some anniversary fun facts about nature But do you know if they\xe2\x80\x99re known for harboring an ancient evil? As they head down the old dusty trail, and make jokes about the gnarly and sticky motel room that is likely in store for them, they run past Lacey and decide to stop. Unfortunately, she was honey potting the young couple and as a result of their indecision, D is able to sneak up on them and take control of the vehicle. While they initially needed a ride, D also reveals the amended plan is to hold them until the banks open in the morning so they can get some spending cash before heading to their destination. As they settle into the situation, Lacey is stricken by a bout of unseasonable shivers. As D tosses the phones and searches their wallets, we find out that Seth is a PhD student. When Lacey perks up and inquires if he has yet been entrusted with writing scripts, her affliction comes into focus. Unfortunately for, well, everybody really, Seth is a biologist. They travel into the night, but have to stop after hitting something in the road. Then they file out to change the flat while the truck takes a relaxing piss all over the asphalt. Lacey thought the animal looked like her dead pet Ginger. Despite the low likelihood of this scenario, she goes back to check it out. Distraught, she attempts to compel Seth to use his biology PhD to help her despite the fact that Ginger is now just a wet spot on the road. Back at the truck D gets a wicked splinter in his finger, but he\xe2\x80\x99s a hard man so he just pulls it out and keeps rolling. With limited options available to him, Seth resorts to wishing Ginger alive and sure enough her remains become agitated. When they get snapped at, Lacey fires on the cat flap and runs. In the confusion they all pile into the car and drive at Lacey\xe2\x80\x99s insistence. When they reach a safe distance she explains what happened, but D reassures her that Ginger is dead and suggests that this may be a byproduct of her coming down off the red dragon, if you know what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying. As he continues to reassure her, the engine temperature rises, risking a warped head. So they pull off at a nearby service station that\xe2\x80\x99s familiar to us. Lacey heads to the bathroom and D has Seth fuel up - after reminding him who the big man is. Then he and Polly go inside to get some coolant. They find it to be strangely quiet as everyone goes about their business. D attempts to check out, but can\xe2\x80\x99t raise the clerk. But Lacey finds him in the bathroom, begging for death. She runs up front to warn everyone of the danger, and luckily she\xe2\x80\x99s an expert communicator. She\xe2\x80\x99s vindicated, however, when a man with spikes comes around the corner and menaces them in short, wonky movements. Despite her early adoption of the danger aesthetic, Lacey gets spiked up while Seth and the others lock themselves inside. D takes a moment to mourn for his lost love, but also reminds them that they\xe2\x80\x99re still kidnapped. Things settle down after a few minutes, so D snaps back into action - stocking up on phone cord, cigarettes and cash. When he goes to erase some evidence, he notices Lacey moving outside. But with only 15 pixels demonstrating this, he feels the need to venture out and confirm it. As he prepares to do so, he makes Seth and Polly pinky promise that they won\xe2\x80\x99t leverage this to their advantage. He proceeds with extreme caution, staying low just in case there\xe2\x80\x99s a sniper nearby. The spines tingle upon the approach of fresh meat, and he drags her back to the station, face down of course. When things start happening, Polly locks the door. Cowardly Seth, however, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to stir the pot, and the end result has them locked back in the store with a new friend in the form of Lacey\xe2\x80\x99s disembodied hand. Seth is interested in its biology, but D treats it like a giant spider. But Seth\xe2\x80\x99s boundless curiosity gets the best of him and he studies it further - watching as it absorbs nutrients from nearby fluids like some sort of mold or fungus. The hand eventually stops, but the rest of Lacey\xe2\x80\x99s body is famished and it thirsts for their fluids. They attempt to escape out the back door, but don\xe2\x80\x99t have a key. Seth goes back up front to search for one, but is coming up empty when D suggests they pop the hinges. So Seth comes back with a screwdriver and they begin to remove the door as D recounts all of his now irrelevant hopes and dreams. Unfortunately, a second layer of security confounds their efforts. Curiously, the banging stops, and they hear the creature shuffling around on the roof. It\xe2\x80\x99s then discovered that this was caused by the arrival of the local Sheriff. They try really hard to convince her to call for backup, but to also be careful and do so from the safety of her vehicle. They eventually reach a compromise Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s something, I guess. As she raises HQ on her radio, she gets some splinters dropped on her grill before being descended upon and ripped in half. At this point, even grizzled Dennis chucks his lunch in the corner. Afterward, they all take a moment to fall into an infinitely deep pit of despair. Meanwhile, topside, the creature reconstitutes the officer\xe2\x80\x99s torso to configure itself into version 2.0. During the next lull, we\xe2\x80\x99re reminded of D\xe2\x80\x99s dirty little secret as Polly and Seth argue over whether they should make for the cruiser or trust that help is now on the way. Then, a third option - they can create a trail of flammable liquid from the back door to the forest, light it on fire and wait for the firemen to come rescue them with their barrel chests and burly arms. Seth is not on board, but in the absence of viable options they tell him to take a breather while they get to work. But then they hear the crackle of Sheriff Frankel\xe2\x80\x99s radio and see that it\xe2\x80\x99s just outside the exterior pay station. Seth immediately fashions a device to try to hook it in. D attempts to help him add to it, reminding us of the creeping dread consuming his hand. Seth fiddles a bit, but eventually snags the cord and slowly draws it in and juuuust over the edge. But the creature drops in to dispute ownership since it is comprised of the Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s torso. It attempts to get in but can do little more than bleed all over the floor with it\xe2\x80\x99s weak, squishy human parts. However, this does present as an enticing snack for several pieces now inside the building. After they repel it, Seth and Polly realize suddenly that there is a conspicuous absence of D. But they\xe2\x80\x99re distracted from this by another autonomous hand, which they manage to hold off because, really, it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be that strong to begin with. D then pops out from behind the OJ to warn them to avoid splinters and invite them into his sweet cooler clubhouse. Once inside, the hand just sort of forgets about them. As they reconvene, the moment is punctuated by his affliction completely ravaging his arm. Noooowwww he decides it\xe2\x80\x99s an appropriate time to try to stop the spread. He calls for a knife, but then passes out. But it\xe2\x80\x99s all good, because Seth finally steps up to do him a solid fairplay. But with only a boxcutter surely the bone will pose a - oh, well, okay then. When he wakes up he is forced to give Seth his props for lopping off his traitorous appendage. Now feeling high after the adrenal dump, he opens up a bit to share some of his motivations. He wasn\xe2\x80\x99t actually going to Mexico. He was trying to get back to his nest egg to gift it to the widow of the man he killed in a robbery that went sideways. Saddled with medical bills, she eventually went bankrupt and he had been trying to help support her while he did his stretch in the penitentiary. The introspective mood leads Seth to a hypothesis that temperature may be a factor in this situation. He needs to check something first, though, so they all creep out of the safety of the cooler to corner themselves behind the counter. Upon review of the security tape Seth posits that this simple organism just wanders around, following the warmest object nearby hoping that it\xe2\x80\x99s food. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t come for him at first, because he was protected by the heat of the engine. If they can stay below the ambient temperature they would be invisible to the creature. Since a hypothesis means nothing without proper experimentation to back it up, he goes into a zenlike state and attempts to induce hypothermia. Since the outside temp is 92 degrees, he waits until he drops sufficiently below that to give him some time to get to the car. The others toss some hot-ass fireworks out the back door for a distraction and, once the creature shows up, Seth staggers out the front hoping he can get there without warming up too much. But, ya boi is struggling. Bad news when they set off a fresh one and the splinter monster seems disinterested. Because when Seth gets to the car there are no keys, the radio is off, and he can\xe2\x80\x99t help but to be hot - attracting the monster\xe2\x80\x99s attention. D tries to regain control by throwing a firework into the front lot, but the creature is not attracted to the hottest thing around anymore and it bursts into the store with them. Despite it being a fair 2v2, they duck back into the cooler. Seth tries to unlock a shotgun, nearly blowing his face off, and then we\xe2\x80\x99re reminded that there was a puddle of lighter fluid out back. As the building goes up in flames, Seth tries to distract it and they recognize that they have to get it into the fire. Seeking redemption Dennis gets up close and personal, firing some shots and taking some splinters before blasting the diesel into a cleansing fireball. Seth and Polly return to him. However, recognizing that he\xe2\x80\x99s done for, he turns over the widow\xe2\x80\x99s address and instructions for accessing his cache of cash. Then they walk off as he ensures there is nothing left behind. As Seth and Polly wander toward the horizon, comforted in leaving the danger behind them, we see that the danger is simply awaiting a new host upon whom it can feed. Much like in the movie itself, Splinter - the movie itself - started small and seems to have built up a loyal following over time. Any acclaim is well deserved. It has a very sharp and effective narrative wrapped up in a sort of a little baby movie at just over eighty minutes long. But they spent the money in the right places, utilizing mostly practical effects and using them sparingly, but with intensity. Taking an excellent creature design and incorporating it into a simple set up that focuses on tension and character development is a winning combination. This is essentially the same recipe that was later used for Attack the Block, another good example that puts these principles to work.
