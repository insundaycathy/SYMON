you want to take it slow, that's okay. but from where i stand, i told you not to talk to charlotte. she's a human woman who isn't ready to hear what you have to do. i was in hell, and that's insane. i want to go home. the last time i took someone on a celestial uber ride, the detective almost died. you have a minute at this point. things can't get any crazier. i can help us both get what we want. decker's the one who's gonna suffer getting her to fall for you and then banishing ruthless. i don't care who i have to hurt, as long as it allows me to finally die. neither i nor lucifer have the power to get anyone into heaven. there's no hope for me. i'm going to oh, here's ireland. stop. i can't do this. what he died. i couldn't hurt her like that. you're mark. he's gone. we don't get chloe to love you, then i can't kill you. and i need this to get back to hell. we need to make the detective realize that pierce isn't the man she thinks is. what do you desire? i want her to choose me, then tell her why. holy decker, will you marry me? yes, slaughter. i like you, charlotte. so if you need time, i can wait. you're worth it. i wouldn't find out your mark is fake. maybe not tonight, but i am coming for you. i never told you what i want. i want you. that's the love. i can't marry you. i'm sorry. marcus. oh, my ring. no, ring. i said, no. okay. you could kill me, sure, but linda would die too. lucifer's the reason that i said yes to pierce. he's also the reason that i said, no, let's go home. i'm afraid that if you saw all of me, would run away. chloe, i am the devil. no, you're me. bad to me. well, it appears that my brother got his wings back. how is that possible? amanda, deal had a crazy theory. i figured out who killed charlie. what it was. pierce. what are you talking about, daniel? what is this? pierce, is indeed the cinnamon? yes, i'm fine. i know you killed charlotte. was anything that happened between us real? any of it? i did love you. i still love you. life was a curse until i met you. is somebody really trying to kill me. don't worry. you're safe. i kill lucifer. what? why? because i know that he'll never stop hunting me. i don't want to die. i would find a way to kill you and that you belong in hell where you would torture yourself without truth for eternity. it's all true. you
