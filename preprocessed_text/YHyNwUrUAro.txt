welcome to the heavy spoilers show I'm your host definition and you're now locked into the channel where we've been watching The Watchmen to break down everything that you need to know about the new season on HBO episode 7 has some major twists and turns most notably the reveal that one of the characters isn't who they say they are throughout this video we're going to be talking about the twist that blew our minds some of the big revelations and why Laurie still though is called Excalibur get it like X Cal a but never mind we'll get into that as we go into the breakdown there will be heavy spoilers here so if you haven't had a chance to watch the latest episode yet and don't want to know what happens then I highly suggest that you turn off now without the way I just want to give a huge thank you for click in this video now let's get into our breakdown of Watchmen episode 7 ok so similar to the prior entry the latest episode of Watchmen is sort of a trip down memory lane however where episode 6 was about Angela's grandfather will the latest released titled in almost religious or focuses on Angela and one of the major characters around her the episode opens with a documentary on dr. Manhattan and it chronicles his humble beginnings before he entered the intrinsic field generator that ended up creating him this ends up being tied into the seventh Cavalry most notably Joe Keens plan in which he wishes to duplicate the process that created the Superman but early on a warning comes with it as in this glimpse we see how the world fused the character it said that whilst dr. Manhattan was a great symbol for America many also feared him and the events that transpired in the graphic novel that led to Ozymandias having to fake an alien invasion in order to unite the world is a strong indicator of just how much that tensions rose with America possessing a weapon that no one could really touch it's because of dr. Manhattan that the u.s. won the Vietnam War and it's also because of this rise in fear that the character ended up going into hiding although he kept a watchful eye over the planet on a human level as we find out in the major twist in the episode that I'll get into later in the recap now at the end of Watchmen dr. Manhattan say that he was going to go off into the universe and try and create life and no I have seen some people say that these are the clowns that posi mandus is surrounded by personally I believe that these are inventions of lady true who as we know specializes in genetics and has created humans before though the clones say he gifted us life I think that this is sort of a creation by the society that exists on the moon who may have created their idea of a male guard mistakingly obviously I don't know for definite but I think trues genetic developments are tied in with them somehow and the deal that she made with Ozymandias when buying his corporations after the dark documentary we then jumped to Saigon to see Angela's childhood most notably what inspired her to become sister Knight similar to Batman who was inspired by Zorro angela is influenced heavily by pop culture and adopts the bright almost comedic depiction of them in film and media into a real-world format that as we know often comes with a dark side to it similar to Batman Angela or rather sister Knight was born out of tragedy and like most superheroes her parents the ones that she cares for a stripped away at an early age which means that she must adopt an almost larger-than-life persona in order to provide protection for herself mentally in what could be a very vulnerable situation it's the dr. Manhattan parade and it's clear that a lot of the locals in the area are heavily upset with the occupation in the Watchmen universe after the Vietnam War the country became a territory of the US and this is why the flag looks so different to the one that we have in the real world there's a man who ends up becoming involved in the bombing that operates a puppet show which to me ties back to the line by dr. Manhattan in Watchmen in which the character says we are all puppets I can just see the strings I'm paraphrasing right now but this image shows that dr. Manhattan controlled the people but that the people also have the ability to control him through their actions even though everything in Watchmen is preordained there only exists the illusion of choice we discover that Angela's parents were killed by his suicide bomber and then we join the character in the present fresh from her nostalgia trip because she took wills nostalgia Angela's memory all over the place now during the scene as a pivotal moment between Angela and her father in which he says people who wear masks are dangerous we should be scared of them when asked why he follows it up with they're hiding something this really sums up the character for me who is an expert at hiding all of the anger and pain that she has went through in her life and this conversation holds a lot of weight to it Angela clearly had a troubled childhood and even as an adult there is a lot that went wrong for her however she managed to move past it due to the system i persona and this really exemplifies why a lot of characters and Watchmen have two personalities one that can bear the brunt of the darkside whilst the other one that can seemingly live a normal life this sort of ties in with the twist and yeah there's just a brilliant aesthetic of duality lights throughout the season Angela's loss of her short term memory has a constantly asking lady true the same questions over and over again and her long-term memory most notably her childhood is laced with visions of wills past namely the Tulsa riots and life as hooded justice true is trying to fix her memories and thus throughout Episode seven she constantly sends her back to the past through neuro dialysis in order to correct her recollection of it true is using an elephant in order to complete the process as we know an elephant doesn't forget and this has most likely been picked because of its strong grip on the past beyond tests Angela with a sort of modern-day Rorschach test but with images instead of ink blots this highlights how perception is shaped by our history namely what instances have shaped us and how some people view things a certain way whilst others dunked we saw in episode 4 that BN was going through a similar treatment to Angela and that she was inheriting the memories of her grandmother we learned that beyond is actually a clone of trues mother and that true has been slipping her nostalgia as she sleeps so that her parents can be there when she completes her greatest achievement this cements that the past shapes who we are and how we view the world which is why true wishes to shape beyond this way this is kind of horrifying and it highlights a true really has difficulty letting go of her past hence her invention of nostalgia and the Millennium clock that she is about to launch true also pays lip service to the fact that her father will be there to you and this could either be dr. Manhattan or the comedian personally I'm going with the latter as I believe that true is the daughter of the comedian and the pregnant woman that he killed in Vietnam true could be recreating the comedian as similar to what she's doing with beyond and it would be awesome to see him show up in the finale there's also mention of what the Millennium clock does and personally I believe that this has the ability to see through time much like dr. Manhattan and that this will be used to predict future events true use this in order to see that she needed to purchase the farm before the thing that fell from space crash-landed there and also provided her with the knowledge of the 7th Cavalry's attack she knows that they are rising and creating their own dr. Manhattan and I believe that with wills help she has used the clock in order to unearth where he really is so that he can fight back Cal tries to visit Angela daily in a blue car and he wears a blue polo shirt and blue jeans because we'll get into it later Laurie also listens back to Angela's outbursts during her nostalgia trip in order to get to the bottom of what's going on the most notable of these is you can hang yourself now which is of course a command that will gave to captain Judd to take his own life which Laurie later relays to Judds wife PT investigates looking-glasses bunker and we also now know for definite that LG survived due to all the members of the cavalry being dead and his body being nowhere to be found he knows that he has been turned on and this will likely be lying low because of their double-cross when questioning judge wife Laurie reveals that she knows about Cyclops hoodie justice and has pieced together the connection between jerd Joe Keene Cyclops and the seven cavalry the Laureus marches she's clearly not that smart divulging all of this to Judds wife who is actually in on it all and she traps her with like I want to say the opposite of an ejecta C trapdoor see anyway Laurie awakens in the seventh Cavalry headquarters and Joe Keene reveals that he is intending to turn himself in to dr. Manhattan because it's extremely difficult to be a white man in America right now now right or wrong this mirrors wills time has her to justice in which he pretended to be a white man in order to fit in Joe wishes to be the best thing that he can be in the eyes of society which is dr. Manhattan hence the change now Joe and the rest have obviously got an altered perception of the world namely because they don't view themselves as racists but also because they think this is the way to change things true wishes to stop them because she doesn't want the world ruled by white supremacists and as we see from all the unanswered prayers in the episode if someone was to adopt the moniker of the doc they would be extremely popular thus true must get the original in order to stop him we learned that Cowell received tole amnesia after a car accident though we know that this isn't really the case as dr. Manhattan cannot be harmed it is possible at tachyons were used to stop his view of time simultaneously as we know from the graphic novel that these have the ability to do so we discovered that after the death of her parents Angela ended up living in an orphanage in Saigon and that she becomes inspired to become a policeman by a female officer who ended up investigating the bombing that killed her parents one of the terrorists that was in on the plot is unceremoniously led away and executed and this could be a reasoning behind Angelis choices as she wishes to find justice in a world that seems to just want to brush it under the carpet Angela is adopted by her grandmother June who as we know from last time was Will's wife she pays lip service to the fact that she and her son had a fractured relationship and this drove him away from her as we know he was aware of his father's of the ego and this may have been a huge factor that pushed him into fighting in the military Watchmen is massively about inheritance and just as Angela seemingly inherited the role as a masked vigilante June's son could've - angela has carried the system ID video as a symbol and she hasn't even watched it and we learn that will ended up scoring his son when he was young which is why he distrusted those that wear masks Jun promises to take Angela to Tulsa but unfortunately she dies after putting her in a taxi in Ozymandias world the character is on trial for trying to escape the confines of his prison and breaking the cardinal rule thou shalt not leave we see a sketch of the alien from the graphic novel and also learn that the character has been on trial for a year furthermore backing up that the the manliest entries are all an anniversary apart there's a skull and crossbones behind the game warden which represents the pirate ship in the black freighter and when asked if he has anything to say in his defense Ozzie farts loudly and it's it's probably the best moment in the show so far yes I am very immature Ozzie is found guilty by way of pig and no we don't see what happens to the character I personally believe that as terms of breaking his agreement he is sent back to earth and then encased in the golden statue we saw his craft crash land on the planet in the opening of episode four and this explains why true wish to purchase the farmland in that entry and from there she captured him and put him in the statue the episode concludes with angela discovering a globe that has the location of dr. Manhattan prep wits on it here true drops the bombshell that he isn't listening because he's in Tulsa pretending to be a human she reveals that will went too true for help stopping the seven cavalry who are planning on creating their own version of the doc after destroying the old one she say she knows that the seven cavalry will launch this attack in an hour which also adds weight to the abilities that the Millennium clock has true tricks Angela into revealing that the latter knows who he is because she doesn't ask well who is mainly because she already knows Angela rushes home watched by cavalry members and she tells Cal how much he loves him before hitting him over the head she says that they always knew this day would come but that Cal just won't remember it it turns out that there was no car accident and that Cal is really dr. Manhattan who wished to go back to having a normal life after we saw the implications that his existence caused Cal doesn't believe it but she hammers home the point and pulls out a ring from his head that is similar to the dr. man-hands symbol which is also the symbol for hydrogen as mentioned earlier I think this may have been made from tachyons and thus it removed the characters memories of his life before the quote-unquote accident will did mention in episode two that dr. Manhattan was on earth and disguised as a regular person and Damon Lindelof upon announcing the show also said dr. Manhattan was perhaps just a scared man sad he would outlive everything so perhaps this move was to take him away from the pain that he was inevitably feeling all of the time the watchmen graphic novel did say that though doc was apparently emotionless he gave away micro expressions that showed he may as well have been sobbing this also explains how Angela survived the seventh cavalry attack as it was just her and will in the house Laurie's dildo was also called Excalibur which yet say that again ex Cal a bar as in Cal a bar is an ex-employee Blake probably the best Easter egg in the show episode 8 will be fleshing out their first meeting and we will see that even back then a doc was trying to hide his true identity as he picks up a mask off the ground and wears it when meeting Angela we see there Angela remained in Saigon as mentioned last episode and here dr. Manhattan approached her saying that he loved her and always had this is because the character can see the entirety of his life at once and thus this is how he knows they will be together he also picks up two beers which mirrors is meeting with Janey Slater the first woman that he fell in love with now I do think this is all building up to dr. Manhattan finding the Cavalry's version of the character and it looks like Angela may not make it out alive doc warns her that she will die trying to save him and this could be the eventual end for the character though we will see I love how the show is all slowly coming together and with just two episodes left I'm hooked to see what the outcome will be this just goes from strength to strength and it's really got me invested in the outcome now obviously I'd love to hear your thoughts on this episode and if you agree with the theories in this video comment below and let me know and if you enjoyed it and please give it a thumbs up and make sure you stay locked to the channel for more watchmen breakdowns as the series begins to wrap up we'll be discussing every episode so it's definitely worth keeping a tune too heavy spoilers for more updates as we get them we also do a podcast called watching The Watchmen in which we break down the original graphic novel issue by issue so if you want to know the full backstory of the book then make sure you check it out after this if you want to come chat to me after the video then make sure you follow me on twitter at definition whitey or head over to my discord server which you'll be linked in the description below we drop videos on there early so if you want to see stuff before anyone else and that's the best place to be it's free adjoin and we have an awesome communities hopefully I see you over there very soon we're also giving away a free copy of the marble phase 3 part 2 boxer blu-ray which contains Black Panther infinity war and Game Captain Marvel amour and all you have to do to be in with the chance of winning is like the video make sure you subscribe to the channel and leave your thoughts on Watchmen in the comment section below the winners gonna be chosen on the 15th of December and the set will be shipped up from then to him I get surprised it's the best of luck to everyone who takes part this is a channel for people who are super into superheroes so if that's the kind of thing you like hit subscribe thanks again for taking the time to watch this I've been definition you've been the best and I'll see you next time take care peace [Music] you
