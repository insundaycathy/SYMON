Welcome to Movie Shortens. Follow us today to a movie titled: ATM. Be aware, there are spoilers!  The movie begins with a mysterious man sitting in his house. He is focused on drawing and measuring diagrams onto a printed map. He then puts on a coat and leaves the house in a hurry.  At a busy financial company, David is in an uneasy conversation with his client on the phone. As he hangs up, his co-worker, Corey comes over and cheers him up. Corey suggests David asking out Emily, a coworker, for a date after the company Christmas party As David has had a crush on the girl for quite some time. Hesitating, David thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s not a good idea especially since the girl plans to leave the company at the year\xe2\x80\x99s end. Corey, argues it is now or never.  At night, David and Corey have a lot of fun at the party. David tries to catch up with Emily, but both of them appear to be embarrassed and nervous. Eventually, David asks Emily if she\xe2\x80\x99d like a ride home. Just then, Corey, who is completely drunk, asks David for a lift to his house, only 10 minutes away. Reluctantly, David has to help, he made a promise to Corey earlier to drive him home. During the ride, the three talk and laugh as Corey appears to be very funny. Since Corey\xe2\x80\x99s phone was lost at the party, he asks David to borrow his However, the phone soon runs out of battery. It is almost 2 a.m and freezing outside. Corey insists on having pizza and begs David to stop at a nearby ATM for cash so he can buy his food. David offers to pay by card but Corey says that the restaurant doesn\xe2\x80\x99t accept cards. Again, David patiently accepts his friend\xe2\x80\x99s demand. At the ATM, the couple wait inside the car as Corey withdraws money. Just then, Corey signals David as he is having a card problem. Being cold and alone in the car, Emily decides to join the men in the kiosk. She carefully locks the car but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work. When she enters the ATM, David lets her know that the lock has been broken, but they won\xe2\x80\x99t take long, so she shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t worry. He then takes some cash from the ATM as Corey is denied for unknown reasons. As the trio turn their back and prepare to leave, they notice a figure. He\xe2\x80\x99s wearing a coat and has appeared from nowhere. Emily thinks its very strange as she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t see his car around. David thinks it could be a robber.  Thinking the man only needs to use the ATM, Corey tells the two to stop imagining and let the man use the machine. Corey shouts out asking if the man wants to get inside, but gets no response.  He stands there in the dark and looks at the three of them. Suddenly, a dog walker appears behind the man. The man rushes to the dog walker and grabs his head with his large hand. In a second, the poor man is smashed in the head, killing him. Terrified, the three try to call 911. However, they learn that David\xe2\x80\x99s phone is charging in the car, Corey\xe2\x80\x99s is lost and Emilys\xe2\x80\x99 is in her purse, also in the car. They have no choice but to look for emergency buttons inside the kiosk, but they find none. Meanwhile, the man just stands there, watching them after just coldly killing a person. The friends are very worried and try thinking of a way to get rid of the man. David asks Emily to give him his car key. Corey tries to stop him from going out. David thinks he can manage to run to the car to take his phone and call the police.  Strange enough, the man approaches David's car, taking out a tool box, they stand there dumbfounded. The man goes to the back of the kiosk instead of entering. It turns out he\xe2\x80\x99s used the tool kit, breaking the ATM\xe2\x80\x99s heater. They become more scared as the man isn\xe2\x80\x99t attacking as he did to the dog walker. David hits the enclosing glass, hoping to set off the ATM\xe2\x80\x99s alarm, but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work. Emily stops him and says that they should wait inside the booth as the man hasn\xe2\x80\x99t yet attempted to enter. David argues that they would die from freezing before being confronted by the man. David and Corey then kick the ATM, trying to set off the alarm. Again, nothing happens. Corey spots a police car, the three yell out to get its attention. However, the car only passes by to their disappointment.  Seeing that the man is not around, David suggests giving the man their money and jewels. He slowly steps outside with Emily\xe2\x80\x99s earrings, Corey\xe2\x80\x99s watch and his $500. He offers the man the property and pleads with him to let them go. The man stands at one side of the kiosk and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t say a word. Thinking the man has accepted the deal, David tosses the envelope so the man can take a look. As he picks up the cash, David ceases the chance, running to his car.  The man quickly pursues him. As David attempts to start the car, he finds the wires have been destroyed. Running out of time, he picks up Emily\xe2\x80\x99s phone and dials 911. The man strikes the window, dragging David from the car. As he is about to kill David, Corey and Emily scream from the kiosk. This distracts the man long enough for David to get up and run back. The man doesn\xe2\x80\x99t give chase, and instead collects the envelope along with Emily\xe2\x80\x99s phone, throwing them back into the car. Scared and cold, Emily uses her lipstick to write \xe2\x80\x9cHELP\xe2\x80\x9d on the door.  As time goes by the three begin to freeze, and a security guard, who sees the message from the window, drives over to investigate. He notices a body and steps out to see what has happened. The trio try to warn him about the man, however he cannot hear them due to the strong howling winds. He is then beaten to death by the man with a tire iron. The friends are shocked and speechless seeing the bloody scene. Suddenly, the man enters the booth. David and Corey fight him back, the only choice they have. They kill the man, strangling him with a wire. Thinking that they have got rid of him, the three begin seeing yet another man outside the booth. It turns out the man they killed was just a normal guy named Harley, who was wearing a similar coat. The friends start to blame each other for their stupid actions. Corey and David fight while Emily tries to stop them. Tired and hopeless, Corey storms out to escape alone disregarding his friends suggestions otherwise. He's tripped up by a wire the man has set up. The man stabs Corey with a screwdriver. He then returns to the back door of the ATM continuing his mysterious work with a fire hose.  Seeing that Corey is still alive, Emily and David run out to bring him back in before the man can catch them. The two manage to stop Corey\xe2\x80\x99s bleeding and keep him warm. Just then, the man pushes David\xe2\x80\x99s car in front of the ATM and leaves. The ATM kiosk begins to fill with cold water through the heating vents. The two struggle to lift Corey up above the water, but they can\xe2\x80\x99t. David finds a lighter in one of Harley\xe2\x80\x99s pockets, and starts a fire using the flyers in the booth as fuel. However, Corey has died due to his wound and the hypothermic water.  Meanwhile, the man sits on a folding chair watching his victims from afar. Emily climbs on David's shoulders, managing to get the flame close enough to the fire alarm triggering a loud distress signal. They have finally made it, but David slips and causes Emily to fall, she smashes her head on a shelf and dies. While grieving for Emily, David sees the security guard\xe2\x80\x99s car ram into his car, which crashes through the wall. Pissed at the evil man, David uses Corey\xe2\x80\x99s bottle of wine and turns it into a torch. He throws it to the man who sitting on the chair. However, it is revealed to be the security man\xe2\x80\x99s body wearing the same coat, driving David more crazy. The real man is still alive and watches David from a distance.  There are police cars rushing to the ATM, the man quickly vanishes. David is arrested as the cops find five casualties in the area. They review the ATM video recording, but there's no audio. It looks like David, Corey, and Emily were robbing the ATM and murdering witnesses. David shows to have murdered his two friends on the soundless tape. No images nor signs of the man appear during the playback. At the end of the movie, we learn that the man is a serial killer with very detailed and intelligent plans. He carries out similar ATM attacks and blames it on the last survivor. David, Emily, and Corey are his latest innocent victims. Only his coat is ever found at the crime scenes.
