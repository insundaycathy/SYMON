welcome. my name is lisa, and now i'm going to talk about sleeping beauty. lucy is a promiscuous university student who works in an office in the daytime and at a restaurant in the evenings. she is occasionally a research subject at a science laboratory. lucy is paying tuition and rent by doing several jobs. she is caring for a sick relative, birdman, who is very attracted to her. while she does not return his sexual interest, lucy enjoys birdman's company, and in his presence is the only time she is shown smiling or laughing. an old joke between the two is that birdman frequently asked lucy to marry him. lucy always says no due to lack of money and birdman's bad health. lucy makes a decision to look for another part-time job. in response to a classified ad for yet another short-term job, lucy meets clara, who runs a service that combines lingerie modeling and catering performed by young women. at a black thai dinner party for mostly male clients, clara assures her that the men are not allowed to touch the women sexually, and lucy agrees to try it. clara inspects lucy's body and names her sarah for the purpose of anonymity. at the dinner party, lucy is the only girl dressed in white. the other women wear black lingerie that is much more revealing than lucy's outfit. after one other session as a serving girl, lucy gets promoted. she receives a call from clara's assistant for a different request. lucy is driven to a country mansion where clara offers lucy a new role, wherein she will be voluntarily sedated and sleep naked while male clients lie beside her. they are permitted to caress and cuddle her, but vaginal penetration is not allowed. after lucy falls asleep, she lies unconscious on the bed and clara leads in her client. after clara reminds the man of the no penetration rule, he strips and curls up beside lucy. after a few of these sessions, lucy has enough money to move into a larger, more expensive apartment where she lives alone. she receives a call from birdman who has overdosed on painkillers. she goes to his house and finds him dying in his bed. sobbing, she takes off her shirt and gets in bed with him, but he dies in her arms. at birdman's funeral, lucy abruptly asks an old friend if he will marry her, in an echo of birdman's old playful banter. the friend, however, not understanding the reference, takes her seriously and shocked, refuses her, citing a number of loosest personal problems as his reasons. at her next assignment with clara, lucy asks if she can see what happens during the sessions while she is asleep. clara refuses, saying it will put her clients at risk of blackmail. lucy decides to surreptitiously film her next encounter. the client is once again the first man, but this time he also drinks the tea with a much larger dose of the sleeping drug. the following morning, clara comes in and checks the man's pulse, showing no surprise when he cannot be awakened. clara tries to wake lucy, who has overdosed as well, and is eventually able to revive her using mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. lucy begins screaming when she sees the dead man in bed next to her. the film ends with the scene captured by the hidden camera, the dead old man and the sleeping girl, both lying peacefully together in bed. thank you all for watching. don't forget to subscribe and hit the bell notification for more of these videos.
